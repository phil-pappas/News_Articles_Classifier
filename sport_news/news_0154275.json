Posted: Friday, October 2, 2015 6:00 am \nMOUNT DORA (3-1) at DUNNELLON (5-0) \n7:30 p.m., Tigers Field \nMount Dora improved to 3-1 last week with a 36-29 win over an improving Eustis squad, while Dunnellon remained unbeaten with a 41-19 win against South Lake. \nHurricanes coach Donnie Burchfield said Mount Dora has been focused on the Tigers all week and he believes his players understand the significance of the game, which is a Class 4A-District 4 matchup. A win for Mount Dora would give the Hurricanes a 2-0 district record and put them in the driver's seat for a playoff berth. \n\"We have been working hard all week,\" Burchfield said. \"Dunnellon looks really athletic on film and, of course, they will be well coached. We have been working on some fundamentals we struggled with against Eustis. As always, the focus this week has strictly been put on getting better at the little things. \n\"We believe that putting focus on the basics is what we need to do right now.\" \nDunnellon, who is ranked No. 5 in this week's Associated Press Class 4A state rankings, has scored at least 40 points in its last four games. At the same time, South Lake's 19 points last week was the most the Tigers have given up in a game all season. \nAfter this week, the Hurricanes have a non-district game at Lake Minneola on Oct. 9, before wrapping up their district schedule against Umatilla (Oct. 16) and at South Sumter on (Oct. 23). \nTAVARES (0-5) at SOUTH SUMTER (5-0) \n7:30 p.m., Raider Field \nSouth Sumter remained unbeaten last week with a 58-20 win at home against Ocala Trinity Catholic, while Tavares fell to Harmony 42-0. The win was South Sumter's 38th straight regular-season victory and the 258th of coach Inman Sherman's career (258-106) — his 32nd season with the Raiders. \nTavares coach David LaMarre understands the challenge his Bulldogs are facing this week with the powerful Raiders. South Sumter, which is ranked No. 4 in the latest AP Class 4A state poll, was so dominant against Ocala Trinity Catholic that it outscored the Celtics 14-6 in the third quarter, despite not running an offensive play. \n\"We've watched film of (South Sumter's) game against Umatilla and they are athletic, tough, physical,\" LaMarre said. \"It's homecoming for them so that's another adverse situation for us. But, all we can do is worry about ourselves and getting better every day. The positive in the game for us is that we're not favored so we can go out there and play with nothing to lose. \n\"One positive when you play South Sumter is that it shows our players where we want to get to.\" \nDespite the Raiders' play against Ocala Trinity Catholic, Sherman said South Sumter is still working on aspects of their play. He said the goal is to clean up the rough spots before going back into district play in two weeks. \n\"Our team played very well against a big, strong Trinity Catholic team last week,\" Sherman said. \"Tavares poses the same type of problems with the great size they have up front. Taking care of the football remains a priority on offense and setting the edge defensively every play is something we continue to work on. Our defensive line — Montel Presley, Will Thompkins, Carson Wells, Brandel Colbert and Brady Mertz — must play fast to offset the great size of Tavares.\" \nUMATILLA (2-3) at THE VILLAGES (3-2) \n7:30 p.m., The Range \nUmatilla picked up a 43-28 win last week on the road against Crescent City, while The Villages beat Orlando First Academy 28-21 in Orlando. \nThis game has significant playoff ramifications for both teams. A loss for either squad virtually eliminates them from playoff potential. Mathematically, the loser would still be in the hunt, but it would have to climb over three teams in final two district games to earn a runner-up spot. \nRichard Pettus, coach of the Buffalo, understands the significance of the game. He also believes it should be a very competitive contest. \n\"Both teams match up very well,\" Pettus said. \"It's going to come down to who controls the line of scrimmage and who doesn't turn the ball over.\" \nUmatilla coach Steve Seward also sees the big picture. \n\"It's a district game that we definitely need to win,\" Seward said. \"We're looking for improvement on the defensive side of the ball. The Villages execute very well on offense, so we will have to work at stopping their run.\" \nORLANDO BISHOP MOORE (4-0) at SOUTH LAKE (0-4) \n7:30 p.m., Eagle Field \nSouth Lake fell 41-19 last week at Dunnellon, while Orlando Bishop Moore was off. This is a Class 5A-District 13 contest. Orlando Bishop Moore is ranked No. 3 in the latest AP Class 5A state poll. \nThe game is latest in a brutal schedule for South Lake. The Eagles' first six opponents have a combined record of 27-3. \nStill, South Lake coach Mark Woolum is holding out hope that his team will defend their home field. \n\"We played a much-improved game, against a great Dunnellon team last week,\" Woolum said. \"Our kids continue to play with a great deal of positive energy and attitude. They keep working to get better every day and refuse to use the schedule as an excuse. The best team we will play this season (in the regular season) is coming to our place (today). \n\"We look forward to the challenge and will continue to pursue our goal of making the playoffs for the second year in a row.\" \nThe Hornets shut out their last opponent, Poinciana, 69-0. Orlando Bishop Moore has not allowed more than seven points in a game all season and have scored at least 33 in three games. \nSouth Lake has a bye week next week, while Orlando Bishop Moore will host South Sumter in a mega-matchup on Thursday. The game will be televised on Bright House Networks. \nLAKE MINNEOLA (4-0) at EAST RIDGE (3-2) \n7:30 p.m., The Dungeon \nIt’s been a turnaround season for both teams this year. Last season Lake Minneola won only four games all season, a total the Hawks have already matched this season in their first four games. East Ridge was winless a year ago and won only two games the year before and the Knights have already surpassed their win total from the previous two years combined. \n“We have been constantly gauging our progress throughout the year,” East Ridge coach Ashour Peera said. “This game is a good measuring stick for us. Although on paper and record-wise we are picked to lose, but for us we want to show our school and community how much progress our program has made. We have had the distractions of homecoming, but our young men have handled it well and will not use that as an excuse. In fact it has energized us because of all the support and school spirit shown this week. Coach (Walter) Banks will have his troops ready to play and they are the favored team in the district.” \nLake Minneola has been the model of consistency this season, having scored no more than 30 points in a game but no fewer than 28. The Hawks are coming off a 29-12 road win at Winter Park Lake Howell to move to 2-0 in the district. \nEast Ridge is coming off a 28-8 road loss to Ocoee in its district opener. \nPOINCIANA (0-4) at EUSTIS (1-4) \n7 p.m., Panther Den \nEustis may only have one win this season, but it’s an important one because it came in the only district game the Panthers have played this year. Now Eustis looks to go to 2-0 in the district against a winless Poinciana team. \n“It is homecoming week and we have been working on the kids to stay focused,” Eustis coach Mike Hay said. \nEustis gave Mount Dora all it could handle last week before falling 36-29. Gentravis Relford rushed for 167 and three touchdowns. Beau Brecklin will be making his third start for the Panthers at quarterback tonight. Senior captain Ricky Ruppy led the defense against Mount Dora with 13 tackles and the defense will welcome back cornerback Sam Taylor, who was injured in the first week of the season. \nPoinciana was off last week and fell the week before 69-0 to Orlando Bishop Moore in its district opener. The Eagles have scored only 27 points this season with 21 of those points coming in one game. \nLEESBURG (2-3) at OCALA VANGUARD (3-2) \n7:30 p.m., Booster Stadium \nLeesburg looks to stay in the district race and snap a two-game losing streak with a road game at Vanguard, which is playing its first district game of the season. The Yellow Jackets are coming off a 48-14 loss to fourth-ranked Class 7A Bradenton Braden River. Leesburg sophomore quarterback Wyatt Rector was intercepted five times in the loss and Rector was intercepted on four of his last five pass attempts. Brian Hepburn threw another interception for the Yellow Jackets and Braden River returned two of the six interceptions for touchdowns. \nLeesburg is 0-1 in the district after falling 31-17 to Ocala Forest two weeks ago. \nVanguard is coming off a 33-32 loss to Gainesville Buchholz, which is ranked eighth in the state in Class 7A. The Knights’ only other loss this season came against fourth-ranked Class 5A North Marion. \nMOUNT DORA CHRISTIAN ACADEMY (0-5) at OCOEE LEGACY (3-2) \n7 p.m., Ocoee \nJasper Pierre continues to lead the MDCA offense, rushing for 123 yards last week in a loss to Jupiter Christian Academy. Pierre now has 533 yards rushing through five games. He had some offensive help last week from Jacob Alleyne, who carried the ball three times for 82 yards and scored two touchdowns. \nOcoee Legacy opened the season with three straight wins before dropping its last two. Both of those losses came against teams ranked in the top 10 in the Sunshine State Athletic Conference. \n“We are playing a very good football team, very balanced on offense and tough on defense” Bulldogs coach Matt McGonigal said. “Last week on offense our eighth- and ninth-grade offensive line made some major progress and we are hoping to build on that this Friday night.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:41:11.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
