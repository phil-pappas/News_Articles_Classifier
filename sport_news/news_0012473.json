We need the rain but most areas will stay dry as there is not a lot of moisture to work with.\nThe front is bringing a drop in dew points, meaning a drier less humid feel to the air as opposed to cooler temps. The drier air will allow morning lows to drop into the 50s on the North Shore to the lower 60s south.\nAfternoon highs will remain in the lower 80s. A reinforcing cold front moves in for the weekend, dropping temps even more. It looks like the dry spell will last at least through this weekend.\nFollow me on Twitter: @BruceKatzFOX8\n- Meteorologist Bruce Katz\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
