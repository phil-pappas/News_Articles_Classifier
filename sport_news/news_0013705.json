The other two countries that were worst hit by the epidemic were Liberia, which was declared transimission free on Sept. 3, and Sierra Leone, which is counting down another 22 days until it is clear.\nThe worst outbreak on record has been largely stopped in its tracks after killing more than 11,000 people.\nBut the WHO has repeatedly warned against prematurely assuming the outbreak is over because the virus could pop up again until the 42 days are over.\n\"On the bumpy road we keep talking about, the high risk of recurrence, once again we are navigating a few bumps,\" Harris said. \"Of course we didn't want it, but we did expect it. Guinea hadn't got to the stage where we were looking at 42 days.\"\nEven after that period, Ebola may lurk in the population. This month a study showed the semen of male survivors can harbour the virus for nine months, while a British nurse has fallen critically ill again 10 months after recovering from Ebola.\nThe medical toolkit for tackling Ebola has been transformed in the past few months by the success of a trial vaccine, which is now used to treat each new case and their contacts who may also be at risk from the highly contagious virus.\nBut Harris said that the trial comes to an end in mid-November, potentially putting a question mark over the use of the vaccine beyond that date.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:25:36.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
