The All-India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) continued its indefinite strike demanding the scrapping of the present toll system, which the government refused to do so. While supply of essential commodities like milk, vegetables and medicines have been kept out of the purview of the strike, its impact was seen in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and other places. The apex transporters body said it would continue with the strike till the government came out with some practical solution to the truckers’ problem. AIMTC officials said they were not against paying toll but were demanding it in an annualised form, adding that the electronic-toll collection system as promised by the government was not practical. While appealing to the truckers to call off the strike, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said the toll system couldn’t be scrapped. “The government cannot scrap toll. We have already assured to implement electronic tolling system pan-India by December. I appeal them to call off the strike,” he said on Thursday. AIMTC claims to have 87 lakh trucks and 20 lakh buses and tempos across the country under its fold. Another truckers’ body, All-India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA), has decided to keep away from the strike. Gadkari said government was committed to delivering good highways to transporters and ensuring that they did not have to wait at toll plazas. The cumulative loss to truckers on account of the strike, which began yesterday at 6 am, will be about Rs 3,000 crore, while to the government it would be over Rs 20,000 crore in two days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:22:09.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
