He completed 18 of 27 passes.\nThe Rockets (6-0, 2-0 Mid-American Conference) led 28-6 at halftime, and then Ely really warmed up. He threw touchdown passes on Toledo's first two possessions of the second half, connecting with Corey Jones for a 55-yard score and then with Cody Thompson on an 88-yarder four minutes later.\n\"We went into halftime and discussed coverages we'd seen and felt like we could get the ball downfield a little more,\" Ely said. \"The (offensive line) was protecting well all day and it was a great job by our receivers getting downfield.\"\nThe touchdown to Thompson was the fourth longest completion in school history, and it wasn't the only record book-worthy play of the game against an Eastern Michigan (1-6, 0-3) defense that entered the game ranked 118th in scoring defense (40.7 points) and 116th in total defense (495.3 yards).\n\"That's a play we run in practice all the time - a pump, double-move route - and Phil threw a great ball,\" said Thompson, who caught the ball near midfield and raced up the sideline for the score. \"I'm glad we finally hit a big play.\"\nToledo sophomore Terry Swanson busted loose for a 90-yard run late in the second quarter that set up Kareem Hunt's 4-yard touchdown run on the next play. The long run — also the fourth longest in school history — was a payback of sorts for Hunt, who converted two fourth-down runs on an earlier drive that ended with Swanson scoring on a 9-yard run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:34:55.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
