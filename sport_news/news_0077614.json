WEXLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Maurice Greene volunteered to switch positions to help Clifton. CLIFTON – Maurice Greene didn't hesitate to trade catches and touchdowns for wins.\nCollege coaches from FCS and Division II schools have shown interest in Greene as a tight end and defensive end. But that didn't stop the Clifton senior from volunteering to switch positions when the Mustangs' junior right tackle, Carlo Alvarado, fractured a bone in his hand late in training camp. \nGreene needs game film at tight end in this crucial time in his recruitment, but the three-year starter's sacrifice was indicative of how determined these Mustangs are to succeed following a 1-9 season in 2014, Clifton's worst since 1999, when it also went 1-9.\n\"He's a high-character kid,\" Clifton coach Ralph Cinque said of Greene, who has moved back to tight end because Alvarado's hand healed. \"Without him playing tackle, we don't beat Fair Lawn [21-7 on Sept. 11]. He made that much of a difference. We had close to 300 rushing yards that game.\"\nGreene, who also has 16 tackles and two sacks, is far from the only player making a difference for Clifton (2-0-1), which has won more games a third of the way through its schedule than it had all of last season.\nIt will need its difference-makers tonight when the Mustangs face their most formidable opponent of the season at Ridgewood (3-1), a perennial playoff participant ranked No. 11 in The Record Public Top 20.\nSenior tailback Danny Martinez (49 carries, 280 yards, three touchdowns) and junior tailback Saadiq Pitts (11 carries, 182 yards, three touchdowns) – a transfer from Paramus Catholic – have been playmakers for a Clifton offense that's averaging 29.7 points per game. It has scored more points in three games (89) than it did during 10 games last season (85).\nClifton also has benefited from junior quarterback Joe Santillo quickly learning the system after transferring from DePaul a week before Clifton's opener against Fair Lawn. Santillo has thrown four touchdown passes and hasn't been intercepted while running the run-oriented offense.\nJunior middle linebacker Adam Miranda (team-high 23 tackles) and junior safety Hunter Halliburton (15 tackles, two interceptions) – another transfer from Paramus Catholic – have joined Greene as defensive leaders.\n\"We want to show that Clifton is a team to be reckoned with, a team that never gives up, a team that fights and a team with a lot of talent,\" senior linebacker Otto DeLeon said. \"Last season, we got beat up a lot. But we worked in the off-season how a playoff-caliber team works, and that's how we're playing.\"\nClifton hasn't reached the playoffs since 2008. The Mustangs' strong start moved them into contention for a North 1, Group 5 berth as the midway mark of the season nears. \n\"Making the playoffs, that would be a dream come true,\" Miranda said. \"Just to get on that road to MetLife [Stadium] with my friends and brothers would be great. We need to cherish these moments because we don't have them forever.\"\nSantillo hopes his new teammates, particularly Clifton's seniors, get to experience the playoffs. He wasn't a varsity starter for DePaul, but he learned how special state championship runs can be while watching from the sideline as the Spartans won back-to-back Non-Public Group 2 titles during his freshman and sophomore seasons.\nClifton could demonstrate its readiness to end its postseason absence by at least playing a competitive game against Ridgewood.\n\"Beating Ridgewood would definitely send a little shock wave throughout the league,\" Greene said. \"It would show that Clifton changed this year, that we're new and improved and we're coming for the playoffs.\"\nEmail: idec@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:01.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
