That is the message the players have had for a decade.\"\nOn Monday the club renewed their faith in the controversial manager.\n\"The club wants to make it clear that Jose continues to have our full support,\" read a statement on the club’s official website.\n\"As Jose has said himself, results have not been good enough and the team's performances must improve. However, we believe that we have the right manager to turn this season around and that he has the squad with which to do it,\" the statement added.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:20:57.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
