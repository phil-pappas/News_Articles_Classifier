(AP) - Three GOP White House hopefuls with very different political ideas are heading to New Hampshire.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a so-called establishment politician, billionaire businessman Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson are all slated to campaign in the first primary state Wednesday.\nBush kicks off the day with a roundtable on substance abuse in Manchester and will address voters at a Bedford town hall in the evening. Trump will appear in Keene at a rally. Carson is holding town hall events in both Exeter and Durham in the afternoon, then he'll attend a meet and greet with doctors in New Castle.\nThroughout the summer and into the fall, \"outsider\" candidates like Carson and Trump have been leading more traditional candidates like Bush in polling.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
