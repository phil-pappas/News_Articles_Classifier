The loss was so bad that even President Obama apparently felt the need to try and offer his comfort to Michigan head football coach Jim Harbaugh.\nHarbaugh, who is in his first season coaching his alma mater, was in Washington, D.C. today as part of a public awareness campaign for First Lady Michelle Obama's Reach Higher Initiative. While visiting with the Obamas, Harbaugh said the president spoke about the heartbreaking loss.\n\"He was great. We talked about some mutual friends that we both know, and he said the same thing you just said: 'Tough way to lose a football game,'\" Harbaugh said according to the Detroit Free Press. \"(He) told the fellas to keep their chin up.\"\nHarbaugh said the president and first lady were watching the game and, despite the outcome Obama said \"he likes the way our team plays and he told the guys to keep it going.\"\n Harbaugh also downplayed reports Punter Blake Mitchell was receiving death threats after a botched punt led to a Michigan State touchdown and 27-23 victory.\n\"The support that we have, that our players have, is powerful, it's enduring,\" he said. \"We have felt it this entire season and continue to do so.\"\nThe Wolverines are off this week before an Oct. 31 matchup against Minnesota.\nMSU beats Michigan on a last-second botched punt fumble return TD! https://t.co/Nt5vRzbwzV\nâ€” Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 17, 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2015/10/michigan_punter_blake_oneill_r.html", "https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/655532740272504832", "http://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/wolverines/2015/10/19/jim-harbaugh-white-house-michigan/74214418/", "https://t.co/Nt5vRzbwzV"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:39:18.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
