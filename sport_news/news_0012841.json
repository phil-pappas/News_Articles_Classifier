The coach expected his team to be playing well by week 10 and that is exactly what happened on Friday night as the Indians shutout visiting Springfield Catholic 35-0. “I’ve been saying all year that this is going to be a really good team by the end of the year,” Johnson stated after the win. “Tonight you finally saw a team that was starting to be consistent, figure out how to play with each other and how to be as good as they could on offense and defense. It was just up to us to finally figure it out and get it clicking.” The two sides tested each other out in a scoreless first quarter of play, but the stalemate did not last much longer. Facing a 4th-and-10, freshman quarterback Dalton Depee saw senior wide receiver Britten McLaughlin sprinting across the middle of the field and hit him with a 22-yard strike to put the Indians on the board. Two possessions later, Osage found some space in the running game as a 27-yard run from junior running back Dylan Brown was soon followed by a 3-yard touchdown run from fellow junior Dylan Riley and the Indians took a 14-0 lead into halftime. The momentum remained with Osage the rest of the night. The Indians forced fumbles on Springfield Catholic’s first two possessions and fumble recoveries by junior linebacker Max Dreier and fellow sophomore linebacker Austin Magnuson led to the next two Osage touchdowns. “We were looking to make an impact in this district and show everyone we are here,” Magnuson said. “We are just looking to survive, play another week and take it one game at a time.” The first touchdown was the result of a 13-yard pass from Depee to senior wide receiver Jason Edwards and the quarterback would find Edwards once again on a 6-yard strike to increase the lead to 28-0. Depee went on to record his fourth touchdown of the night on a 4-yard run later in the fourth quarter to create the final margin. Johnson was pleased with what he saw from the freshman in his first career start. “The cool thing about Dalton is that everyone on this team rallies behind him,” the coach noted. “They all root for him, have faith in him and believe in his ability. I don’t think that all comes from his performance on the field, but how he conducts himself in the classroom, the hallway and how he acts and treats people. To get that kind of respect as a freshman takes a special kind of person.” Depee said he was just happy to help extend the year for those of his teammates who are playing their final football season as seniors. Page 2 of 2 - “It was a moment for me to show what I have and do something for the seniors,” Depee stated. “We finally got things clicking, showing what we can do and it’s another step forward.” The Osage defense stood their ground throughout the night, letting Springfield Catholic drive as far as the Indian 10-yard line before forcing the first fumble. Johnson said this defense is young, but not lacking in ability. “We said from the beginning of the year that we thought this defense could be just as good, if not better than last year’s,” the coach remarked. “We have the athletes that can make plays and a lot of young guys, but guys that are really good. We have four sophomores that are becoming comfortable with not only their jobs, but their own physical abilities. Whenever you are a sophomore on the field maybe you are not 100 percent sure what you can do, but now these guys know and they are going to make plays.” Osage (5-5) will face Mountain Grove (8-2) for the second straight year in a district semi-final on Friday night. The Indians hope history will repeat itself after knocking off the Panthers in a 46-43 overtime win for the district championship a season ago. Kick-off from Mountain Grove is scheduled for 7 p.m. By MICHAEL LOSCH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:33:11.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
