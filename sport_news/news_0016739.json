Power was already being restored in some areas.\nNo injuries have been reported since the fire began Tuesday. A preliminary investigation has determined a farmer mistakenly started the fire as he dragged a shredder through tall grass, causing an overheated bearing to ignite grass clippings.\nThe wildfire has scorched more than 7 miles of forestland in an area 40 miles southeast of Austin. But Bastrop County Emergency Management Coordinator Mike Fisher said firefighters “have got the upper hand on this thing.”\nKari Hines, spokeswoman for the Forest Service, said that the fire had not made any large gains in acreage over the last 24 hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:25:11.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
