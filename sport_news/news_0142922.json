She’s a stud!” Sure, high school softball doesn’t compare to MLB, but Francka’s stats are pretty mind-boggling. Entering Thursday’s district semifinals Francka is 45-65 (.692 avg.) with a .770 on-base percentage; both rank in the top 3 in Missouri all-time according to the MSHSAA record book.“When she’s going good is when she hits it to left-center,” said McHolland. “She can hit the ball any place on the field.” And if that wasn’t enough Francka has 18 stolen bases, 31 extra base hits, just three strikeouts and a .908 fielding percentage. It’s those facts that are drawing interest from college coaches and should solidify her spot on the Class 2 All-State Team. With all those accolades there’s something else that makes Francka valuable. Her loud, whacky, sometimes a little crazy clubhouse leadership…and of course the chants.“To the green 15 to the green!”“I say Erica you say ‘Merica!”“Good eye! Good eye! Good eye! BALL!!!” And even some sort of high-pitched bird squawk.“I get the cheers going,” said Francka, whose family makes up a quarter of the crowd at every game. “We do better when we’re up in the dugout and up in the game.” Apparently it’s working. The Panthers are 18-5 entering districts as the number two seed behind perennial power Pleasant Hope.“The louder we get the more the other team is like, ‘oh no’.” Francka is far from the only good player or leader on this team, but she is the undisputed leader and McHolland hopes she and the other seniors are enough to bring home a district title and maybe even a return trip to state.“She’s just a good ballplayer. She just loves the game.”“When she goes, we go.” Morrisville plays in the Class 2 District 6 semifinals Thursday, 6:00 pm vs. El Dorado Springs at Pleasant Hope. The championship is Saturday, 1:00 pm at Pleasant Hope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:18:35.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
