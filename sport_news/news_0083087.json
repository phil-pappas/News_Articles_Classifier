(AP Photo/Felipe Dana) \nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Nikola Vucevic scored 18 points, Shabazz Napier added 14 and the Orlando Magic took command early on the way to beating the Brazilian club Flamengo 90-73 on Saturday night as part of the NBA Global Games. \nThe Magic led 13-2 early and eventually built a 28-point edge. Victor Oladipo scored 13 for Orlando and Evan Fournier added 10 for the Magic. \nMarcelo “Marcelinho” Machado, a longtime Brazilian star and a veteran of international play, led Flamengo with 17 points. \nMAGIC: Orlando held the Brazilian club to 32 percent shooting, while connecting on 49 percent of its own shots. … Vucevic addressed the raucous crowd before the game, thanking them for their hospitality on Orlando’s visit. … Backup C Greg Stiemsma made his preseason debut, checking in during the fourth quarter. … Magic coach Scott Skiles said he was happy with the way his team handled the trip. “We knew it was going to be a good environment to play in,” Skiles said. \nFLAMENGO: It was the second straight season that Flamengo — which plays in Brazil’s top league — lost to the Magic. Flamengo went winless on a three-game preseason NBA tour last year against Orlando, Phoenix and Memphis. \nSKILES CAUTIOUS: Skiles kept Aaron Gordon (soreness) and Elfrid Payton (hamstring) out of the game, though neither injury issue is considered serious. \nUP NEXT: Orlando returns home Wednesday for its next-to-last preseason contest, playing host to New Orleans.
