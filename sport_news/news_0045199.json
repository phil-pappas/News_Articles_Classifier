Like, he rushed there in the mid-1970s. This was shortly after word leaked that efforts were being made to bring Major League Baseball to Toronto, back when Dyck was a successful businessman living something of a Canadian dream. He grew up so poor on the prairie that as a boy he played baseball in bare feet. As the son of an illiterate schoolhouse janitor in tiny Morden, Man., he’d come to understand that food on the family table was more pressing than cleats on his feet. But he escaped poverty in part by working for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and by becoming an RCMP officer by age 18. After departing the force a while later, he embarked on an executive career in transportation that brought him prosperity in the GTA.\nBut such was his enduring love of his childhood passion that when he heard a group spearheaded by beer-industry executive Don McDougall was endeavouring to move the San Francisco Giants to Toronto, he bolted into action.\n“I didn’t know (McDougall). But I’m a pretty aggressive guy. So the first thing for me to do — I go right to the source,” said Dyck, 81 now.\nHe wrote a letter congratulating McDougall on the effort to bring baseball north.\n“And I had a line in there, ‘And by the way, this is my application for two tickets should a team materialize,’ ” said Dyck. “And, of course, as you know, it didn’t.”\nSan Francisco kept the Giants. Dyck kept the letters coming. And by the time it was announced Toronto would be home to a major league expansion team come 1977, Dyck had established a reputation.\n“Long story short, I guess I pestered (McDougall) enough, or annoyed him enough, and he called me one morning in my office and said, ‘Any man that’s as interested as you are — you can have any two seats you want,’ ” Dyck said.\nThe seats of Dyck’s dreams were an aisle pair in the front row, directly behind the catcher at Exhibition Stadium. And that’s roughly where he’s been sitting ever since, even if more than a few things have changed. The team moved to the building formerly known as SkyDome in 1989, and at first Dyck occupied the front row there. Between then and now the club added a few rows of premium seating between Dyck’s perch and the plate, although not before granting Dyck first dibs, an offer he declined because he didn’t like the lower sight lines.\n“As it turned out, it was a good choice,” he said.\nHis regular-season seats, which are now in Row Five, carry a face value of $72. Forward rows go for more than double that.\nSuch is the reality of the ever-escalating prices of prime sporting real estate. Dyck’s original seats at the Ex went for $6.50 apiece in 1977, about $24 today according to the Bank of Canada’s inflation calculator. This week, secondary-market tickets in Dyck’s vicinity at the sold-out Rogers Centre were listed for $1,000 apiece and more. Face value on one of Dyck’s ducats for the American League Division Series, which he bought with the priority access afforded subscribers, is $125.\nSome things have stayed the same. After all these years Dyck still hasn’t missed a home opener. And he still splits the tickets for 81 regular-season games with John Miller, a retired banker and long-time friend.\n“Herm, he’s a real booster. He loves his Blue Jays,” said Miller, 82. “I’m a wee bit more cynical. But we’ve stuck together after all these years.”\nOne man’s curmudgeon is another’s connoisseur. Sitting in the humble, tidy bungalow Dyck shares with Carol, his wife of 53 years, a Day One fan was asked how he weathered the 22 years that made up the longest post-season drought in pro sports before the Blue Jays clinched this month\n“Ninety nine per cent of the people who come to the ballpark, they just want to see the Jays win. I’m not that way,” he said. “I go to every game expecting to see a good play from either team. If a good play is made in the ball game, I am totally, totally satisfied. But do I want to see the Jays win? Of course.”\nDoes he want to see fans do the wave?\n“Nonsense,” he calls it.\nAnd what does he think of the throng’s penchant to stand in unison at big moments?\n“It drives him crazy,” said Carol, who, after early-days indifference to baseball, has become a regular fixture alongside Herm at games. “He says, ‘I wonder if they stand up at home when they’re watching the game on TV?’ On the other hand, people are excited. So I stand up some times.”\nIn a household in which contrarianism resides, Herm Dyck doesn’t mind taking unpopular stands. Deride the tired Rogers Centre if you will, but Dyck says he likes its rain-out-free practicality, even if he would opt to close the roof to the blazing glare of summer on account of his skin cancer, which he says he’s managing fine.\n“I used to think it was great to have a nice tanned body,” he said. “Wrong, Herm.”\nNot to forsake sunshine, this past summer he slathered on the block and played another in a line of seasons of slo-pitch in Etobicoke’s over-55 league.\n“He just can’t let it go,” said Tyrone Crawford, a 69-year-old Toronto lawyer who toiled professionally in the Detroit Tigers system and who has played in the league alongside Dyck. “If a guy like that did let it go, he’d die.”\nSaid Dyck, speaking of his beloved over-55 league: “None of us go to anyone else and say, ‘I’m hurting today because my arthritis is kicking up.’ We just go out and have fun.”\nThat’s what he’ll be doing from the best seat in the house on Thursday afternoon, Blue Jays win or lose.\n“Right behind the catcher, elevated just a little bit,” he said, describing his vantage point. “Where could you get a better view?”\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays fever in Toronto comes with a side of selective memory\nJake Arrieta leads Cubs to shutout of Pirates in NL wild-card game", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:01:58.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
