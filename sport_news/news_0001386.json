Whether they're for the good or the bad remains to be seen, but it will definitely be an influx of users to the park,\" said Suzy Cress, president of the Morris Heights Improvement Association. \"I think it will be nice, though.\"\nCress has lived in Morris Heights, directly North of Sand Creek Park, for 32 years. She said she was apprehensive when the city decided last summer to add more amenities to the largely untouched park, since the original plan for the 100-acre space was to leave it as natural as possible.\nBut city officials said the new features — including more viewing and educational areas, playgrounds, an amphitheater, shelters and a picnic loop — were carefully added to enhance the natural environment and attract park-goers off the R Line when it stops directly in front of the park at Fitzsimons.\n\"The original Sand Creek Park master plan (from 1996) did not contemplate the introduction of a bustling medical campus, major arterial or an adjacent light-rail corridor,\" said Tracy Young, the manager of the planning, design and construction division within Aurora Parks, Recreation and Open Space. \"Sand Creek Park will include dynamic public spaces that provide a place to escape the urban environment.\"\nAdvertisement The $3 million project was developed in 2013 shortly after plans for the light-rail station serving the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus moved it a half-mile away from its original destination on Montview Boulevard to Fitzsimons Parkway. Track work and platform construction are underway there now.\nWhile light-rail work is going on, a portion of the Sand Creek regional trail, which runs nearly 14 miles between Commerce City, Denver and Aurora, has been closed. There are also ongoing north- and southbound lane restrictions on Fitzsimons Parkway, and the Peoria Street intersection at Fitzsimons will have intermittent lane closures headed north and south.\n\"When the rail alignment changed from Montview, the new alignment takes it through the old path, requiring the regional trail to be closed and then rebuilt,\" said Hunter Sydnor, spokeswoman for the Kiewit Corporation. \"There will be additional brief closures of the drive into the Sand Creek parking lot for the track to be installed in the next few weeks.\"\nTo help with the extra distance between the station and the campus, officials at the university are developing a shuttle bus service to take light-rail passengers from the Fitzsimons stop to five different locations on the campus.\nThat service will also help with the increased density in the area that will come with the eventual emergence of the Forum Fitzsimons, Aurora's first mixed-use, transit-oriented development.\nThat project is set to break ground at 2:30 p.m. Oct. 8 at the site on 13650 E. Colfax Ave.\nThe development is planned to have 28,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space, and 397 rental homes at Colfax Avenue and Potomac Street, across from Children's Hospital Colorado.\n\"With its proximity to the Anschutz Medical Campus, this project is in an ideal location for students, working professionals, baby boomers and millennials looking for a high-quality living space in a walkable urban environment connected by rail to the rest of the metropolitan area,\" said Aurora City Council Member Sally Mounier.\nMegan Mitchell: 303-954-2650, mmitchell@denverpost.com or @Mmitchelldp", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:43:48.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
