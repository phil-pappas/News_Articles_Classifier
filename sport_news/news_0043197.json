(USC SID) -- The University of South Carolina football team worked out for two hours on Wednesday afternoon at the new practice fields. It was day two under interim head coach Shawn Elliott.The Gamecocks (2-4, 0-4 SEC) will host the Vanderbilt Commodores (2-3, 0-2 SEC) on Saturday, October 17. The annual Homecoming game is set for a 4 p.m. kick and will be televised on the SEC Network.Quarterbacks coach G.A. Mangus was named as the offensive coordinator following Steve Spurrier’s departure, and Mangus is enjoying his new role, but noted it’s a group effort.“We’re all working together here,” said Mangus. “We’ve got a good system here. We’ve had a lot of success here. There are a few tweaks. The biggest thing is to make sure we give our guys the best chance to have success. That’s what it’s all about.”Coach Mangus indicated that all the offensive coaches would have input into the play calling. “I’m going to be on the sidelines and call it,” said Mangus. “In between series we all get together and see what they’re doing from upstairs and Steve (Spurrier Jr.) will be upstairs. He’s used to being up there.”“This is a good system,” reiterated Mangus. “It’s something that I’ve been part of off and on for a long time and changed some things through the years. The passing game – I learned 25 years ago from Coach Spurrier and that part of it is great and we believe in it whole-heartedly. There are some things we’re going to do with tempo and things of that nature.”Coach Mangus feels like the quarterbacks have played pretty well for the most part all season. “They’ve all done pretty well. Their grades and things they’ve done during the games have not been bad. We’ve got to play better and more consistent as an offense. That’s been our biggest issue this year is just consistency.”Mangus indicated that Connor Mitch, who started the first two games of the season before suffering a shoulder injury, continues to show improvement and could be available for Saturday’s game. Lorenzo Nunez was in a yellow jersey today and is not expected back this weekend, but could return in the near future as well.The Gamecocks will return to the practice fields on Thursday afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:12:25.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
