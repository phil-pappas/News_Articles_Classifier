So impressionable. So wide-eyed. So good. \nAdd Jared McCann to that ready-for-prime time trio and placing Linden Vey, Frank Corrado and Alex Biega on waivers earlier in the day was trumped by the organization cashing in on a rare daily double. \nThe Canucks got younger and better. And it’s a good bet that 2014 first-round picks Virtanen and McCann will get more than the customary nine-game look for junior-eligible players — or have those games spread out to include the world junior tournament before the first year of their entry-level contracts is burned. \nThey’ve earned the right to start the season and prove that what they accomplished in the pre-season can be maintained when the real bullets start flying Wednesday in Calgary. \nThe Canucks could have waited until next summer to flip the transition switch with nine expiring contracts, and this goes beyond marketing and filling those empty seats at Rogers Arena. \nIt’s about a merit-based system because Vey and Corrado were outplayed and Biega is a franchise depth defenceman. \n“For the young guys, they’ll be evaluated every game,” said Canucks coach Willie Desjardins. \n“If the league starts intimidating them, then they have to go somewhere else because that’s where you hurt a player. We’ll see if it’s after two games or six, or maybe it’s never. Maybe they handle it and are here for the year. \n“Speed excites me. I like guys who can skate and push people back and Virtanen and McCann can do that, and it excites me. They’re ready.” \nA year ago, Desjardins wasn’t crazy about a 19-year-old on his roster. Bo Horvat had suffered a pre-season shoulder injury and then had a pointless five-game conditioning stint with the Utica Comets. \nHis defensive diligence laid the foundation for a 13-goal, 25-point rookie season. \nAre the new kids capable of that? \n“I like history and I like knowing and I want to know when we go on the ice what will this player gives me because then I’m confident,” added Desjardins. \n“Will he take a bad penalty and can I count on him in tough situations? Young guys don’t have that (history) and there’s not that comfort because they haven’t had a chance. \n“The only way they get it is by getting that chance, so you kind of get caught.” \nDesjardins had Henrik and Daniel Sedin with Brandon Sutter on Monday and he likes Horvat between Sven Baertschi and Radim Vrbata. \nThat could put McCann between Alex Burrows and Jannik Hansen and Adam Cracknell between Brandon Prust and Derek Dorsett in the opener. \nThe fourth line is heavy enough and the Canucks may not need Virtanen’s size and grit, but Desjardins wouldn’t confirm his lineup. Sutter, Burrows and Dorsett can play either wing and Burrows could be back with the twins in a hurry Wednesday if things don’t click. \nWhat has clicked are the kids. Virtanen, 19, has an NHL-ready body and bravado, surprising speed and a nose for the net, and he had four points (2-2) in six games. His bowling-ball approach could be a boon Wednesday. \n“He surprised me a bit,” said Desjardins. “I thought he might fall off a bit, but he got stronger. What he does, he does well.” \nSo, how do you park him in the press box for the opener? \n“We have to keep somebody out — not that it’s him,” laughed Desjardins. \nAnd when was the last time we heard that with a real sense of conviction that the guy sitting out can play? \n“It’s still soaking in — I’m pretty excited right now,” said Virtanen, who has switched from No. 77 to No. 18, his junior number. “It’s an honour. My ability to play physical and get in the corners and get to the net and bring energy is what young guys can bring. My confidence has just kept building.” \nHutton, 22, has but four games with the Utica Comets on his pro resumé, but the mobile defenceman has looked like a seasoned veteran with poise, patience, an effortless stride, pinpoint passes and five points (1-4) in seven pre-season games. He just has to learn how to fight. \n“There’s no fighting in college hockey, so I better learn now,” laughed Hutton, who has switched from No. 60 to No. 27 (junior) because his No. 10 (college) was unavailable. “Somebody (Pavel Bure) had dibs on that. I had no idea I would be here this long, but I’m going to keep rolling with it and I’ve had a smile the whole time. It’s been a blast. Guys made me feel comfortable and I was comfortable making plays.” \nMcCann, 19, overcame shoulder and neck injures at the world junior showcase in August and a bad bout of mononucleosis last September to excel in every situation, whether aligned with skilled forwards or asked to play more defensively for three-zone awareness. \nHe responded with four points (2-2) in six pre-season games. From the outset of main camp, the Canucks saw a creative forward who moves well, goes to the tough areas and makes something happen. \n“(Steven) Stamkos is one of my favourite players,” said McCann, who has switched from No. 51 to No. 91 because his junior number (19) is up in the rafters (Markus Naslund).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:40:27.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
