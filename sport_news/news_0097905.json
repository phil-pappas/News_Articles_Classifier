The Eagle standout delivered often enough to set the state’s record for career kills (1,985) and help deliver back-to-back 3A state titles the past two seasons. \n“When we had Alyssa, I could just get it to her whenever we needed it and she’d put it down,” White said. \nSilver Lake no longer has Schultejans, the standout taking her powerful right arm to Kansas State after graduating in May. But the Eagles have hardly missed a beat. \nIn fact, after sweeping Rock Creek on Tuesday night in a key Mid-East League match, Silver Lake is off to its best start under eighth-year coach Sarah Johnson. The Eagles are 24-2 with the only losses coming to Class 5A No. 3 Shawnee Heights and Class 4A Division II No. 2 Hayden. \nSilver Lake didn’t begin the year ranked No. 1 in 3A despite coming off two straight state titles. But the scorching start, which included tournament titles at Jefferson West and Rossville and a runner-up finish at Seaman, catapulted the Eagles back to the top spot quickly. \n“I think maybe some people underestimated us and the talent that was hiding behind Alyssa,” Johnson said. “We really have quite a few offensive threats and we did last year, too, but Alyssa did get stuff done. Everybody knew that. But it made us better in practice time having these girls go up against her and this year I really think they were excited that it was their time to shine.” \nIndeed, Silver Lake’s overall firepower did get overshadowed by Schultejans’ monster season a year ago, one in which she pounded out 732 kills — third-most in a single season in Kansas history. In complementary roles, returning Eagles Marissa Bates had 162 kills, Rachel Heiman added 130 and Jordan Yoder had 102. \nThat trio has stepped up this year and combined for 315 kills, led by 197 from Bates and 123 from Heiman. Meanwhile, Schultejans’ replacement at outside hitter, junior Alex Ferguson, has done her best impression of her former teammate, leading Silver Lake in kills with 257. \nInstead of having one go-to hitter, the Eagles can really come at opponents from about any direction. \n“This year, we can really spread the ball out,” White said. “We don’t just have one person that we really count on to put the ball down. Whoever wants it, I can give it to them.” \nJohnson has called White the glue to her offense. A four-year starter at the setter position, White has Johnson’s full confidence and the Eagle coach says she’s seen her “quarterback” get even better this year. \n“She’s an impressive young lady,” Johnson said. “She’s been my starting setter running a 5-1 and never coming off the floor since her freshman year. I’ve had to yell at her one time, her freshman year, and not since. She’s very intelligent and knows the game and where everybody’s at. Not having Alyssa has pushed her to think outside the box on what calls to make. We’re usually on the same page and she does a tremendous job.” \nWith a month left in the season, Silver Lake once again has the look of a team capable of pulling off the 3A three-peat. Johnson called the losses “good to learn from” and sees the same qualities in this year’s team as those that captured the last two state crowns. \n“It’s good to have one or two under your belt — I don’t want any more than that — but it’s good to learn how we handle things because it’s only going to get tougher at sub-state and state,” Johnson said. “I think they have the drive and they know how to win. Not only do they have a couple state volleyball titles under their belts, but they’ve got track and softball too. They like to compete and you can see that they don’t give up.” \nVOLLEYBALL \n■ Waverly took the title at the Burlington Invitational, improving to 21-4. Payton Meader had 34 kills, 12 blocks and 55 digs to lead the Bulldogs to the tourney title. \n■ Rock Creek took second at the Wamego Invitational, falling in the finals to Circle after beating the Thunderbirds during pool play. \n■ Council Grove finished second at the Herington Invitational, going 5-1 with the lone loss to champion Sacred Heart. \nCROSS COUNTRY \n■ Santa Fe Trail’s Hannah Honeyman set a school record on her way to the girls’ title at the Royal Valley Invitational. Honeyman finished the 5-kilometer race in 18 minutes, 57 seconds to break her old school mark and won by nearly a minute over Cornerstone’s Ally Holloway. Sabetha’s Keegan Cox won the boys’ race in 17:33. \n■ Wabaunsee swept the individual titles at its home meet as Braden Tharman won the boys’ race in 18:56 and Madeline Hess took the girls title in 21:44. The Chargers girls also won the team crown, placing four in the top seven. \nGOLF \n■ For just the third time in program history, Silver Lake broke the 400 barrier on its way to the title at the Jefferson West Invitational. Led by a runner-up finish from Jordan Sharpe with a 90, the Eagles posted a 398 to edge Spring Hill by one shot. St. Marys’ Madalyn Kleinsmith won individual honors with an 87. \nBrent Maycock can be reached at (785) 295-5662 or brent.maycock@cjonline.com .Follow Brent on Twitter @CockyHawk91 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:09:23.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
