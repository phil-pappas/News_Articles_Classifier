Both play two classes up in the mostly 7A NIC-10 and could be dangerous Class 5A playoff teams. If they get to five wins to reach the playoffs. And especially if they get to six wins, making tonight's clash at Belvidere especially important. \"Getting to six wins is big,\" Belvidere coach Chuck Leonard said. \"We're going to have to win out to get a better seed if we don't want to play the No. 1 team in the state in the first round again.\" Twice in recent years, Belvidere, as a No. 16 seed, has almost beaten a No. 1, so even at 5-4 the Pretzels and Bucs could make a run. At 6-3, though, they'd probably be favored to make the longest playoff run of any NIC-10 team. Both are capable. If they hang on to the ball. Belvidere lost 28-6 to Guilford last week after back-to-back wins over then-unbeaten Harlem and Hononegah teams. The Bucs also had five turnovers to Guilford's one. They never had more than two turnovers in their first six games. \"We just had too many self-inflicted wounds,\" Leonard said. \"And Guilford made us pay for it every single time. We put our defense in tough spots by turning the ball over. Several times our defense stood up, but we asked them to do it too many times.\" Freeport had it's four-game win streak snapped with a 28-14 loss at Belvidere North. \"We had four turnovers and they didn't have any,\" coach Aaron Wichman said. \"Take any of those four turnovers away and it's a different game.\" The most costly was a fumble into the end zone from the 1 when the Pretzels could have tied the game at 21-all. Last week, Guilford's Damonte Reed gashed Belvidere for 198 yards and all four touchdowns on 17 carries. Now comes Freeport's Vance McShane, who has 448 yards in the last two games alone, something not even his brother, Steve, the NIC-10's third all-time leading rusher did. \"He's improved every week, and really hit his stride the last couple of weeks,\" Leonard said. \"It's a typical approach when you play Freeport: You can't let McShane loose. He has a different first name this year, but that's it.\" \"Vance,\" Wichman said, \"has learned that the true art of being a running back is staying in the designated hole to start, then bouncing it out.\" The Pretzels this year, though, are far more than McShane. Their offense has been clicking better every week, and they've been strong on defense all year. Freeport was last in the NIC-10 in points allowed the last two years, at 42 per game, but now ranks just one point out of third with 119 points , a 17-point average, 25 better than last year. Page 2 of 2 - \"They are very talented on the defensive line,\" Leonard said. \"There is not a weak spot across their defensive line. They also have very good linebacker corps. They've been holding offenses down. \"They are a very good football club overall. They are capable of going toe-to-toe with anybody in the conference.\" But then so is Belvidere. \"They throw the ball well and they run as well,\" Wichman said. \"They are more balanced than a lot of teams we've seen. \"They get a lot of tough yards. They don't try to get outside and outrun people much. It's usually a north-south run game with them. We've done well against the run this year, even last week against North, but we have to make sure we're good with the tackling.\" Matt Trowbridge: 815-987-1383; mtrowbridge@rrstar.com; @matttrowbridge", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:57:48.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
