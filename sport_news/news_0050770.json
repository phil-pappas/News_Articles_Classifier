Yardbarker Oct 21, 2015 at 8:11p ET 0Shares \nMILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee branch of the NAACP says Bucks player John Henson deserves more than a \"closed-door apology\" from the owner of a Wisconsin jewelry store where Henson says employees racially profiled him. \nHenson said Thomas Dixon, owner of Schwanke-Kasten Jewelers in suburban Whitefish Bay, met with him at the team's training facility and apologized on Tuesday. That's after Henson said employees on Monday refused to let him in the store, then called police. \nIn a statement Wednesday, the NAACP's Milwaukee chapter said the store needs \"to take some bolder measures to demonstrate its clear acknowledgement of wrongdoing and serious commitment to change.\" \nA telephone message seeking comment from a store representative was not immediately returned Wednesday evening. Dixon earlier told WISN-TV that the incident was a misunderstanding. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:47:45.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
