The sickening part was the fact he wasn’t moving. He just lay there, very still. The referee didn’t even bother to count. He just knelt down beside O’Connor as the ring doctor and O’Connor’s corner men rushed into the ring to aid the fallen fighter. It was a rematch last Saturday night between O’Connor (26-2 going into the fight) and Gabriel Bracero of Brooklyn (24-2), who had handed O’Connor his first defeat four years ago. But on this night the stage in the Lowell Memorial Auditorium was set for a confident O’Connor to even the score and catapult himself into world title contention before a largely hometown crowd. O’Connor is from Framingham, but the Lowell auditorium is where he won four New England Golden Gloves championships as an amateur. He had talked before the fight about how good it would feel to again be fighting in the auditorium. But the curtain had barely been raised when Bracero brought it down with a crash just 41 seconds into the fight. The sudden ending was not indicative of the respective talents of the two fighters. It was just one of those counter punches that was perfectly timed and perfectly placed in an exchange between the two fighters. O’Connor never knew what hit him. For everyone else it was one of those scary moments in boxing when a raucous fight crowd grows increasingly quiet waiting for -- hoping for -- some movement from the stricken boxer. It was a good five or six minutes before there was movement and another five minutes before O’Connor was able to get to his feet, though his eyes still looked a little glassy as he was helped to his stool. I don’t know if it was the punch or his head striking the canvas that did the most damage, but considering the fact that Bracero is not known as a puncher (it was only his fifth knockout in 26 fights), I have to think his head meeting the canvas had something to do with it. I do know that everyone in that auditorium and most of the people watching on television breathed a sigh of relief when O’Connor finally got to his feet. It was a grim reminder, however, how tragedy is just a punch away whenever a boxer climbs into that ring. SEALS TO TEST ‘LA BOMBA’ When I first read that Edwin “La Bomba” Rodriguez (27-1, 18 KOs) will square off against Michael Seals Nov. 13 in Biloxi, Mississippi (Spike TV), I figured it as just another tuneup for the Worcester bomber in his quest for a world title fight in the light heavyweight division. You’ll recall that Rodriguez, whom some of you remember from the Southern New England Golden Gloves Tournament in Fall River (he went on to win the 2006 national championship), failed in his bid for the super middleweight title two years ago against undefeated champion Andre Ward, which prompted him to move up a division. He is 3-0 with two KOs so far as a light heavy. Knowing nothing about the unranked Seals except his record of 19-0 with 14 KOs, I didn’t see him as a serious threat to Rodriguez, but that assessment may have been a bit premature. I still haven’t seen him fight, but a video tape of an interview with Seals impressed me enough to do a little more research on him. While Rodriguez is looking to reestablish himself as a contender in the light heavy division, Seals sees the fight as a golden opportunity to crash the big time himself. He bristled in the interview when reminded that he hasn’t fought anyone of note and might not be ready for Rodriguez. “”I’m ready,” said the personable Seals. “I’ve been ready. I’ve been trying to get fights with the top contenders, but for one reason or another, they just never happened. I feel like I have the same talent as those guys at the top, (Sergey) Kovalev, (Adonis) Stevenson. I respect those guys, but I’m talented, too.” He doesn’t think he’s getting the respect he deserves from the Rodriguez camp. “Everybody is already counting me out,” he said. “They’re already talking about (Rodriguez’s) next opponent. But this isn’t going to be any walk in the park for Rodriguez. He better be training hard because I’m training hard. I’m always training hard. I’m living it. This is the biggest fight of my career. “I have all the respect in the world for Rodriguez,” he continued. “He gave Ward a tough fight and Ward is one of the best. He’s fought a lot of good opponents and now it’s time for me to step up and show what I can do at that level. I’m ready.” The one area where Rodriguez will have a big edge is experience, which could prove fatal for the 33-year-old Seals. A native of Mobile, Alabama who fights out of Atlanta, Georgia, Seals had only five amateur fights before turning pro. A former linebacker at Alabama A & M, he didn’t start boxing until he was 23. He may be a natural athlete and a fast learner, but that’s an awfully big handicap to overcome against a seasoned, hard-hitting veteran like Rodriguez. “Michael Seals is coming to fight,” said the soft-spoken Rodriguez, “and I know what a win means for him and his career. That being said, this is going to be my night.” On third thought, I think I’ll stay with Rodriguez. Seals may get an ”A” in effort, but Rodriguez will get the “W.” ‘BOO BOO’ IS BACK Demetrius “Boo Boo” Andrade of Providence begins his quest to regain a world title Saturday night when he takes on Argentinian Dario Fabian Pucheta (20-2, 11 KOs) at the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. Andrade (21-0, 14 KOs) was recently stripped of the WBO junior middleweight world title for inactivity due to several proposed title bouts failing to materialize for one reason or another. Saturday night’s fight for the WBO and WBA international junior middleweight titles will be his first in 16 months, which he hopes will put him back in the rankings and lead to another world title shot. “I’ve had some bumps in the road and it took a year to get them settled,” said Andrade. “But I haven’t suffered any damage in the ring. I feel good. The fans are going to say they need to see a lot more of Demetrius Andrade.” Tickets are still available and go from $25 to $200. For more information, call 401-724-2253. PROBLEM SOLVED Adrien “The Problem” Broner may be right in his self-analysis: when he cuts out the clowning and sticks to business, he’s a very good fighter. He certainly was in his one-sided 12th round TKO of Khabib Allakhverdiev for the vacant WBA super lightweight title, his fourth world title in as many weight divisions. “No disrespect to Shawn Porter (to whom Broner lost in his previous fight), he’s a wonderful fighter, a world class fighter,” said Broner after the Allakhverdiev fight, “but at the end of the day, when Adrien Broner is on his (game), a fly can’t be around me. It’s definitely all up to me.” Amen to that.
