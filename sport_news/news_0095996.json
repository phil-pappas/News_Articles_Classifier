Hudson earned the 2014 championship with his brother Nathan Hudson last year, but was forced to play singles after Nathan suffered an ACL injury earlier in the season.“Back-to-back state championships is a phenomenal accomplishment,” Pottsville head coach Keri McAlister said. Losing his brother, who was his partner and our teammate was hard for all of us. Nathan is a huge part of our team. Kyle switched from doubles to singles, and he did it seamlessly.”Hudson went undefeated in the 4A-4 District Tournament on Oct. 19-20 in Jonesboro to earn a first round bye at state. Hudson defeated Clinton’s Garrett Bradley 6-0, 6-1 in the quarterfinals, then Shiloh Christian’s Ellito Doxsee 6-1, 6-1 in the semifinals, before moving on to Arkansas Baptists’ Seth Hernandez in the finals.Hudson dropped his first set 0-6 but rallied to win the next two 6-3, 6-1.“After losing that first set, I watched him switch gears, and the fighter emerged,” McAlister said. “He went after his opponent with everything he had. The greatest divider of players in tennis is toughness, and for those next two sets, Kyle exemplified what it is to be tough. “Most players would have got down and fallen under the weight of what they had to do to win the next two sets. Kyle did what he always does and rose to the situation and elevated his game to secure another title. He had the character, discipline and persistence to fight through obstacles and adversity and still find ways to get it done.”Nine tennis players from Pottsville qualified and played in the state tournament. Celeste Parker and Abbie Cormier both reached the quarterfinals.“All of these kids are great tennis players and amazing people,” McAlister said. “Words cannot convey how proud I am of my team.”McAlister said she was impressed by Hudson’s humility.“You would never know he is a two-time, back-to-back state champion,” she said. “He doesn’t walk around arrogant. He absorbs all the responsibility of the task at hand. He wants to carry the load for himself and his team, but he deflects the praise and acknowledgment back to everyone around him. That is rare. That is admirable.”Resultsn Celeste Parker defeated Lauren Douglas from Hamburg, 6-1,4-6,6-4.Parker lost to face Shirley Hernandez from Arkansas Baptist (eventual runner –up), 6-3,6-4.n Abbie Cormier played Rebecca Fellers from Arkadelphia and won, 6-4,6-0Cormier was defeated by Aly Landers from Cave City, 6-4,6-2n Erin Heikes and Mariah Prock were defeated by Lovrien/Loflin from Brookland, 6-2,6-1n Cara Monk/Kaelyn Pearson defeated by Elder/Rumbach from CAC, 6-4,7-5n Braxton Fields/Noah Robbins defeated by Pigott/Horne from Monticello, 6-1,6-1  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:27:21.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
