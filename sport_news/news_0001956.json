The two have split the reps in the past two games.\n\"There's not a drastic difference in what those quarterbacks are,\" FAU coach Charlie Partridge said. \"[Johnson] runs a little bit more than [Barden], but he will still tuck it away and run.\"\nJohnson has been the more effective of the two, throwing for 491 yards and three touchdowns. Barden has completed 16 of 33 passes for 111 yards and a touchdown.\n\"They're fairly similar players, throwers first, runners second,\" Partridge said. \"The game plan doesn't change a lot. Their play-calling doesn't appear to change a lot.\"\nQuarterback update\nAll signs are pointing toward quarterback Jaquez Johnson returning to the starting lineup. Johnson, who has missed the past two games because of a sprained ankle, is no longer wearing a protective boot and participated fully in Thursday's practice\n\"We're getting him reps with the [starters],\" Partridge said. \"We're still evaluating him. He's not at 100 percent yet but hopefully the odds are good that he can play for us on Saturday.\"\nNext game: FAU at Charlotte, 7 p.m., Saturday\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56045781/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-0925-20150924"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:48:19.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
