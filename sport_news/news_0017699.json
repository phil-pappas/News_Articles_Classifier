The Beavers are coming off what is probably their worst performance so far, a 44-7 loss at Arizona. Andersen said the players have responded well. \"Like I've always said, we're going to tell them exactly where we're at and how we feel about things and they don't expect anything different,\" he said. \"But they responded well, I think they're well prepared and I really believe they understand that the fight that we're in is a big boy fight, a serious opportunity every day to get better and we need to get better. The only way you get better is you accept the challenge that's in front of you. So for the most part, we're in a good spot.\" Andersen was asked if Saturday's game at Washington State is now a big moment for the Beavers. \"I think every game right now, every practice for us is just a big moment, if you will. And until we get things switched in our favor, they'll all be big moments,\" he said. \"But the great thing too is these kids have a lot of opportunity to look for this excuse or that excuse and there's none of that. They hold themselves responsible just as we do as coaches and we're doing the best with everything we have right now and continue moving forward.\" MAKING MOVES ON D: Some of those strong words from Andersen were about the defense and how the staff might make changes as far as playing time or even positions. The coaches have taken a look at some different players and shifted a few as they look for stronger play on defense. Cornerback Dwayne Williams and lineman Sumner Houston could get some additional time on the field. \"Dwayne deserves an opportunity to play more and he'll get that. Some packages he's in there, some packages he's not. But he'll receive that opportunity,\" Andersen said. \"Sumner also will be given the opportunity to hop right into the front as far as their substitutions and the way they roll through a game.\" Safety Cyril Noland-Lewis will play more nickelback, while Devin Chappell will move to safety at times. \"It's game by game, it's week by week, but it also is matching kids in certain spots to play,\" Andersen said. \"We'll see Devin more at safety this week and you'll Cyril down more in the nickel position and those are simple switches that we're trying continually to move the kids around to the best spots to be able to give us a best chance to win.\" READY TO ROLL: Seth Collins said on Wednesday that the Beavers are \"foaming at the mouth\" to get back on the field on Saturday at Washington State after the loss to Arizona. Andersen likes the attitude, but wants the players to take it to every aspect of football, not solely game time. \"I hope they're foaming at the mouth to wake up and practice and life weights and do all the things that come with it,\" Andersen said. \"Because as we know and this group of kids needs to continue to understand, it's how you prepare that allows you to win games in an elite conference.\" By Kevin Hampton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:53:07.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
