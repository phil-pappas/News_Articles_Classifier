As such, he has been withdrawn and his replacement will be announced in due course.\" \nSouth Africa took a 2-1 lead in the ODI series after winning the third match by 18 runs in Rajkot on Sunday. \nThe fourth match is due to be played in Chennai on Thursday, with the fifth and final game scheduled for Mumbai on Sunday.
