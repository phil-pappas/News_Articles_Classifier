Tepera had a 3.27 ERA in 32 appearances over three stints with the Blue Jays this season. \nCecil said Saturday that he won't need surgery and will be ready for spring training. He got hurt while tagging out Mike Napoli in a rundown than ended the eighth inning of the Blue Jays' 6-4 loss to Texas on Friday that gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series. \nWhile Cecil initially thought he only had a cramp, he said the \"pain took over\" once the adrenaline quickly wore off after the inning-ending play. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:54:27.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
