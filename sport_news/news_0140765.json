Lovett was sacked by Rochester three times, and six times overall as the Indians shut the Warriors out. Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow POWDER SPRINGS — It’s safe to say McEachern’s defense was a bit headstrong Friday night.The Indians came through with their first shutout of the season blanking North Cobb 35-0 to take over the Region 4 lead at Walter Cantrell Stadium.North Cobb (3-4, 2-1) was clicking following a tough non-region slate with region wins over Harrison and Hillgrove. But when the Warriors arrived at McEachern, they had trouble running and passing.McEachern (5-1, 2-0) held North Cobb to negative rushing yardage in the first half and just 34 yards for the game. Jai Irwin and Quannie Green were the rushing leaders, with only 29 yards apiece. The Indians sacked North Cobb quarterback Will Lovett six times, with Georgia-bound defensive tackle Julian Rochester collecting three of them. McEachern didn’t allow a first down until the second quarter and forced the Warriors to punt seven times. It also forced a turnover when Bryce Sims intercepted a pass late in the game to set up a McEachern touchdown.It was the Indians’ second shutout of the season, and the first time since 2005 that McEachern blanked more than one opponent in a single year. Despite the offensive shortcomings, North Cobb was still in the game in the third quarter, trailing 21-0, but McEachern’s defense remained relentless. “The defensive front dominated the game,” McEachern coach Kyle Hockman said. “The front and the linebackers played a heck of a game and did a heck of a job. Our front’s tough to handle.”It did take a quarter for McEachern’s offense to get going, however. Promising drives were often marred by penalties or miscues, and the Indians were forced to punt. But once they got the ball inside North Cobb territory during the closing seconds of that first quarter, they took advantage. McEachern needed just three plays to find the end zone as Sam Jackson scoring on an 11-yard run on the second play of the second quarter. Jackson, who finished the game with 195 yards on 12 carries, scored twice more in the first half. The first came on a 1-yard run, and the second was on a lengthy 73-yard dash —following Sims’ interception — to give McEachern a three-touchdown lead.McEachern’s 21-0 lead stood until the final play of the third quarter, when Bailey Hockman hit Christian Roberson for a 3-yard touchdown in the back-right corner of the end zone. Roberson, who was in traffic, jumped to make the grab.McEachern added one more score early in the fourth quarter when Hockman connected with C.J. Windham on a 21-yard screen pass. Hockman went on to complete 11 of 15 passes for 145.North Cobb’s defense made plays of its own to keep McEachern off the board early in the game. A first-quarter sack by Chandler Wooten got his team off the field. The closest North Cobb came to scoring was late in the fourth when it was on the McEachern 18-yard line, but the drive stalled with either incomplete passes or caught passes for no positive yardage.The shutout was North Cobb’s first since a 34-0 loss to Camden County in the first round of the 2011 state playoffs. “We couldn’t do anything offensively and didn’t play well defensively,” North Cobb coach Shane Queen said. “They definitely outplayed us. Our kids fought, but we didn’t make plays when we needed to.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:00:31.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
