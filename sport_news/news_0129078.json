NFL acknowledges officiating mistake 1 / 1 Back to Gallery For the second week in a row, the NFL acknowledged an officiating error in a nationally televised game.\nThis time, the problem was twofold: 18 seconds were incorrectly run off the clock late in the fourth quarter Monday night in the Pittsburgh Steelers ' 24-20 victory at the San Diego Chargers â€” and none of the game officials noticed the gaffe and corrected it.\nIn a statement emailed Tuesday, league spokesman Michael Signora said that \"an error by the clock operator\" after a touchback allowed the extra time to tick away, and \"it is the responsibility of the side judge to supervise the timing of the game.\"\nThe statement added: \"Had the side judge or any of the other six on-field officials noticed the timing error, they could have corrected it.\"\nIn last week's Monday night game, an official missed a late-game call in Seattle's 13-10 victory over Detroit, giving the Seahawks the ball even though one of their defenders knocked a fumbled ball out of the end zone, which should be a penalty. That prompted the NFL's head of officiating, Dean Blandino , to say that the officials blew it.\nThe most recent Monday night mistake happened after San Diego kicked a field goal to take a 20-17 lead with 2:56 left. The ensuing kickoff sailed out of the end zone for a touchback, so the clock never should have started. Instead, it did begin moving, and by the time Pittsburgh lined up for the first play of its crucial drive, only 2:38 remained.\nBills: Buffalo signed free-agent quarterback Josh Johnson in a move that raises questions regarding the status of banged-up starter Tyrod Taylor . Johnson was signed Tuesday, a day after coach Rex Ryan said Taylor was \"beat up\" following a 14-13 win against Tennessee. Taylor will be monitored through the week as Buffalo (3-2) prepares to host Cincinnati (5-0) on Sunday. Taylor missed one play against Tennessee after turning his left ankle while being tackled after a 24-yard run. Taylor's backup is former starter EJ Manuel.\nChiefs: Jamaal Charles was placed on injured reserve after the star running back tore the ACL in his right knee while making a cut against the Chicago Bears .\nJaguars: Jeff Tuel was signed to the practice squad, giving Jacksonville a third quarterback in case Blake Bortles can't play this week because of a sprained throwing shoulder.\nPanthers: Middle linebacker Luke Kuechly returned to practice for the first time since suffering a concussion in Carolina's season-opening win against Jacksonville.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/22/8787080/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/22/8787080/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:20:42.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
