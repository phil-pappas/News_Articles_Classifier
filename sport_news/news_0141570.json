Pic/AFP \nNeymar pulled a goal back from the penalty spot 16 minutes from time, but the injury-struck visitors were left to rue a host of missed opportunities and some fine goalkeeping by Sergio Rico as Sevilla registered their first league win over the Catalans since 2007.\nDefeat leaves Barca still a point off leaders Villarreal, but they can now be passed by either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid when they face off on Sunday.\n\"It is almost incredible that we go away from here having scored just one goal after seeing the ball ping around the opposition box,\" said Barca manager Luis Enrique.\n\"We had 10 minutes in the second-half which cost us when Sevilla were much superior. They got ahead, after that we tried in every way possible but we can only congratulate Sevilla for their effort,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:09:02.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
