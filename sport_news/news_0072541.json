Below are a few of Kingsbury's highlights.\nOverall thoughts following the win:\n\"Proud of the defense, thought they kept bailing us out. Offensively, that's on me as a head coach, not having them ready to go. Guys got nervous and really we just all choked on that side of the ball - that's the only way to put it. Drops and penalties and fumbles and not interested in playing hard. They outplayed us; they outcoached us on that side of the ball. But really proud that our defense stepped up and won that game.\"\nOn slow offensive start:\n\"I did a terrible job getting ready this week. I thought we were at a point, offensively, where we weren't, actually. I thought we had mature players that could get it done and handle it. But, you know, you play with those young wide receivers - they all got nervous and all started dropping balls. When they walked down and played man, we couldn't win. I mean, it was just a disaster. Quarterback didn't play well, at all. DeAndre (Washington) , like I said, was really the only guy that put us on his back at times and got it done.\nOn Le'Raven Clark's injury:\n\"Just wanted to get him out for precautionary reasons so I'm not sure yet. They've got to examine him, get him back to Lubbock and see where we're at on that deal.\"\nOn Paul Banks' injury:\n\"I think he just kind of got a stinger - one of those deals, so they pulled him out.\"\nOn defense carrying the load:\n\"That was the case, the entire game. I mean they hold them to - shut them out, I think the first half and we just kind of floundered around offensively. So it was a big step in the right direction on the defensive side of the ball and offensively we took a huge step back. But I'll get that right, we can get the offense going this next week and that won't happen again.\"\nOn the strip-sack fumble:\n\"I thought our two guys were fighting over it, unfortunately, and their player did a heck of a job being heads-up and picking it up.\"\nOn Jah'Shawn Johnson's pick-six:\n\"He made a great play, did a good job of getting in the end zone. I'm glad he did 'cause we probably couldn't have, offensively, the way we were playing.\"\nWatch Kingsbury's postgame press conference here.\nFollow Mike DuPont on Twitter: @MikeDuPont_\nComplete Texas Tech coverage Gary Rohman/Gary Rohman/MLS/USA TODAY Sports\nOct 17, 2015; Lawrence, KS, USA; Texas Tech Red Raiders head coach Kliff Kingsbury talks to his team in the first half against the Kansas Jayhawks at Memorial Stadium.
