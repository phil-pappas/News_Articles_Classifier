For Rutgers, this could be a season saver after a plethora of problems, highlighted by the suspension of coach Kyle Flood for three games for trying to influence a player's grade and the dismissal of six players following arrests. \nKEY MATCHUP \nRutgers offensive line against the Spartans' defense. The only way the Scarlet Knights win is if they can have a balanced attack and let quarterback Chris Laviano choose when to throw. Rutgers is averaging 211 yards rushing. The problem is when they pass. Michigan State can put the heat on. It has recorded 18 sacks. Spartans defensive lineman Shilique Calhoun could have a big day if the Spartans limit Rutgers on the ground. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nMichigan State: RB LJ Scott had career highs for carries (18), rushing yards (146) and rushing touchdowns (2) in 24-21 win over Purdue on Saturday. It was his first career 100-yard rushing game. The 146 rushing yards were the most by a Spartan freshman since Javon Ringer had 194 in 2005. Scott has now been named the Big Ten Freshman of the Week twice. \nRutgers: WR Leonte Carroo. He was reinstated on Wednesday after simple assault charges were dropped for an incident outside the stadium after a loss to Washington State. He has missed the last two games and could be looking to prove something. Despite missing 10 of 16 quarters this season because of suspension, he is tied for the team lead with three touchdown catches. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nThe last time the teams met at Rutgers Stadium, the Scarlet Knights won 19-14 in 2004. ...
