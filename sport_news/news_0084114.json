LOUIS (AP) - Out since injuring his shoulder last October, St. Louis Rams wide receiver Brian Quick is finally going to be back on the field. \nQuick said Friday that he will be active for Sunday’s game at Arizona. \n“When you’re working every day in practice and seeing your brothers out there fighting, you want to be out there with them,” Quick said. “I’m excited to get out there.” \nThe 6-foot-3, 218-pound Quick has worked hard to get back after he sustained a torn rotator cuff against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 26. He was placed on the injured reserve list three days later. The injury, which some thought was career-threatening, required surgery and a lengthy recovery. \nIt’s been a long time getting back to active status for Quick, a second-round selection of the 2012 draft out of Appalachian State. \n“You can’t give up. On anything you do in life, you just can’t give up,” Quick said. “I just want to go out there and do whatever I need to do as far as anything if I get the opportunity.” \nCoach Jeff Fisher has been in no rush to start Quick. But he will be out there when the Rams (1-2) visit the division-leading Cardinals (3-0). \n“He had a great week. We hope it carries over into the game,” Fisher said. \nThrough the first three games, Rams wide receivers have combined for just 27 catches and 290 yards. Kenny Britt and Tavon Austin have been the Rams’ two starters; Britt practiced Friday but didn’t the previous two practices with a sore shoulder. \nQuick noted he has learned the new offense and said he is working well with quarterback Nick Foles. \n“I’m dialed in,” Quick said. “I’m getting back into the speed I need to be in. I’ve missed a lot since last year.” \nBefore he was hurt last year, Quick racked up 25 catches for 375 yards in seven games. Offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti is looking forward to getting Quick back on the field. \n“We’re excited. It’s a great problem to have in terms of, ‘Wow, who’s going to be down?’” Cignetti said. “You see that Brian’s making tremendous progress.” \nNow Foles has a big target to throw the ball to in a game. The two have worked together after practice and spent time in the meeting room. \n“The sky is the limit for that guy,” Foles said. “So talented, such a big receiver. His ball skills are among the best I’ve seen, just how he goes up and gets it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:18:08.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
