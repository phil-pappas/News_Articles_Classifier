LA Galaxy’s Omar Gonzalez was playing after being omitted from the USA’s roster to face Mexico in the crucial Confederations Cup qualifier this week — the latest setback in a drift rather than a fall from grace since he went into the World Cup last year as the incumbent starting center-back for the national team. Before the game Gonzalez was even sounding non-committal about where he would be next season, as Bruce Arena shapes LA’s crowded and expensive roster for the Gerrard-Dos Santos era.\nIn fairness, Gonzalez did not play like a man distracted, but over on the Seattle team, the distractions were piling up. Lamar Neagle didn’t know he was even playing until just before kick off, when the utility attacker was thrown into the game in place of Nelson Valdez, who injured himself in the warm up. Neagle looked predictably tentative all night as he struggled to find the game before being subbed out. Clint Dempsey did play, but he claims to still only be around 90% fit after his hamstring injury this summer, and despite some familiar improvisational moves, at times it clearly showed. And Chad Marshall missed the game entirely after his worrying neck injury in training this week.\nNot that every distraction was unwelcome. Ossie Alonso could have been forgiven for dwelling on being watched in person by his father, who he hadn’t seen since defecting from Cuba seven years ago. Ossie Alonso Sr was permitted to travel to the US following the recent diplomatic thaw, and watched the game with the Seattle supporters.\nWhatever the reasons, the combined result was a messy game, with the opening goal coming, suitably enough, from a mistake. Zach Scott was left holding his head in his hands after a sloppy square pass only succeeded in setting up Robbie Keane to dart in for a tap-in to open the scoring late in the first half, but while he continued to live dangerously throughout the game, he was hardly alone.\nSeattle did press more in the second half, and got the psychological boost of scoring the equalizer in injury time, but in truth neither team should read too much into this result, and Seattle in particular will be loathe to. These two may yet meet in the playoffs, but after the Sounders beat LA at home to clinch the Supporters Shield last year (a fact celebrated, not un-coincidentally, on Sunday night with the unveiling of a championship banner at the stadium) they went on to lose to them in the playoffs en route to the Galaxy winning another MLS Cup.\nThe Sounders are still playing their way out of their summer slump and determined to peak for the playoffs, and while extending their unbeaten streak to six games was welcome, they won’t make the mistake of thinking that any outcome of this game signified either triumph or disaster, with the real challenges still to come in November. 2014 lesson learned.\nThe Galaxy meanwhile, have had some very poor results on the road this year, so were set up pragmatically rather than inspiringly — compressing the midfield and looking to steal a goal. And they did. It almost worked on the night. Ultimately it didn’t, but the result ensured another playoff appearance for them, and for them too, that’s all that matters right now. The rest is so much distraction. GP\nOrlando City’s might count cost of keeping their play-off hopes alive Every week for the past month or so three MLS coaches check the score of another particular match. In fact, Mauro Biello, Gregg Berlhalter and Greg Vanney probably get Orlando City in-game updates to their phones or directly into earpieces, but every week for the past month or so the news from Florida has been bad news. With every Orlando win – of which there has been four in succession – the ticker-tape cannons in Montreal, Columbus and Toronto are made to wait another week to pop.\nOf course, all three sides are on the brink of securing their spots in the playoffs – with the Montreal Impact also enjoying their own surge of form, winning three of their last four league fixtures. Mauro Biello’s interim appointment has had the desired effect, but the Impact’s upturn since the firing of Frank Klopas has been offset by that of Orlando City. And with Saturday’s result at the Citrus Bowl – a 2-1 win for the Lions over Montreal – just one point now separates the two sides on the playoff threshold.\nBut perhaps slightly lost in the Orlando glee at such a result was the cost it could have on their playoff run-in. Cyle Larin and Seb Hines found the net in Saturday’s win over Montreal, but City’s recent form has been sparked by the form of Kaka – who assisted two of Orlando’s five goals against the Red Bulls last week – and the return of Brek Shea from injury. However, both will be missing through yellow card accumulation for their next game – a home clash against New York City FC which could make or break Orlando’s play-off ambitions.\nAdrian Heath may have to find replacements for more than just two first-team players, too. Rafael Ramos and Tommy Redding were both withdrawn following a collision between the two in the win over Montreal – with Ramos even making an emergency room visit for treatment on a gashed head. Phil Rawlins tweeted after the match that both players weren’t too badly beaten up, and with a two-week break before Orlando’s next fixture Heath might survive defensively, but the absence of Kaka and Shea for the visit of NYC FC will be of greater concern.\nAnd yet Orlando are in such a deep groove, on the back of wins over Sporting KC, the Chicago Fire, the New York Red Bulls and now the Montreal Impact, the loss of two key figures might not matter. That’s what Heath hopes anyway, with the former Everton midfielder insisting that others will step up in Kaka and Shea’s place. But with Montreal and Toronto FC holding games in-hand over Orlando, the games might run out before their form does. GR\nKrisztian Nemeth has come good at the right time In Benny Feilhaber Sporting Kansas City have one of MLS’s best assisters and an MVP candidate in an alternate soccersphere without Sebastian Giovinco. But at the weekend Krisztian Nemeth didn’t need Feilhaber. In fact, the Hungarian forward didn’t need anyone as he jinked through one and then two and then three Portland Timbers defenders before sliding a low finish home in Saturday’s win. It was his 10th of the season and a legitimate Goal of the Year contender .\nNemeth’s solo effort was of critical importance to his team, too. In a Western Conference where just nine points separate the leaders, the LA Galaxy , and third from bottom Houston Dynamo, wins are at a premium right now. And with just three regular season fixtures left to play Sporting KC are in good shape for a tilt at the Supporters’ Shield.\nIf Peter Vermes’ side do finish atop the regular season standings Feilhaber will be heralded as Sporting KC’s headline act – and rightly so, given the astonishing campaign the midfielder has enjoyed. The 30-year-old has 10 goals and 10 assists to his name, and in the MVP award’s handicapped market (without Giovinco) is the frontrunner. But beyond Feilhaber, Sporting KC’s upturn has been just as attributable to Nemeth.\nThe Hungarian has come good at the right time. Including his wonderful, right-footed strike in the US Open Cup final win over the Philadelphia Union , Nemeth has scored three times in his last four outings – adding to his tally despite playing just 17 minutes against Portland on Saturday evening. Sporting KC has been Dom Dwyer’s team – at least in the final third – for the past two seasons, but it is increasingly becoming Nemeth’s.\nOn the basis of their starting frontline against the Timbers, Vermes was angling for a draw on the road at Providence Park, perhaps pre-empting any fatigue felt after their US Open Cup exertions. Between Connor Hallisey, Jacob Peterson, and Bernardo Anor, Sporting KC fielded scant attacking pedigree in the Pacific Northwest–- and only when Nemeth came off the bench did they pose Portland any problems. Even then, true goalscoring opportunities weren’t exactly aplenty.\nWhile Nemeth’s goal was the undoubted highlight of the contest, Vermes was surely primarily pleased with his side’s defensive resolution against the Timbers, with Matt Besler and Kevin Ellis enjoying what was probably their best game as a centre-back pairing. Sporting KC haven’t conceded more than one goal in a match since the 3-1 defeat to Orlando City on 14 September, and that solidity suggests that this side has just a hint of the club’s 2013 team about it. Factor in Nemeth - who is yet to even fulfil his full potential - and the win over Portland was more encouraging than the scoreline immediately illustrates. GR\nMike Petke’s legacy lives on in New York — with a few key amendments When Mike Petke was ousted as head coach of the Red Bulls in January of this year, it pushed long time fans of the team into open revolt. Petke had not only delivered the team’s first trophy, but represented a connection to the team’s Metro history that went a long way to ease the suspicions that still persisted about the absentee Red Bull ownership. In many ways Petke was a symbolic as much as a competitive success, and the nature of his dispatch felt like a self-inflicted wound by management.\nFast forward to Saturday night and Petke was back in Harrison being honored as one of the team legends of the past 20 years, as voted for by the fans. It had the potential to be an awkward occasion — though was perhaps inadvertently eased by his successor Jesse Marsch serving a one game touchline ban after being sent to the stands in last week’s loss to Orlando.\nIn the event a gracious Petke held court with a few reporters in the Red Bull Arena interview room before Saturday’s game, and seemed to have come to terms with his firing, while still maintaining that his reign was ultimately a success for changing the character of a Red Bull team with a historic reputation for flakiness. He maintained that the character he instilled in the side en route to the Supporters Shield in 2013 and within a goal of an MLS Cup appearance last season, was still present in the current team that Marsch has taken to the top of the regular season standings again.\nHe might be right. Coming off a humiliating 5-2 home loss to an expansion team, the Red Bulls did what they’ve generally done in similar circumstances this year, other than in one spring stretch of four losses — made immediate amends. The visiting Columbus Crew SC had caused them problems at time this year, particularly when the directness of Kei Kamara was utilized in the second game of this year’s series in Ohio, but other than scoring first and rallying late, they were safely nullified by a Red Bull team who played with both a certain stung pride and rather more nous than they’d shown against Orlando last week.\nKamara was largely a non-factor, as the Red Bull defense, reshaped for the absences of Kemar Lawrence and Matt Miazga, concentrated on disrupting his aerial threat and at least winning second balls. Without that variation Crew SC’s preferred ideal of playing out from the back was always susceptible to the New York pressing game, and a couple of forced turnovers duly played their part in New York going back to the top of the Shield standings with a 2-1 victory.\nYet while the character and intensity could be traced to the Petke days, the victory was also marked by some of the nuances that have arrived under Marsch – the team picked their moments much better than against Orlando, where Conor Lade in particular was repeatedly exposed by the fast Orlando counters. Against Columbus, New York looked better briefed and better organized on when to stay and go, and it was that as much as their character in scoring two minutes after falling behind that ultimately saw them prevail. Petke should receive due credit. So should Marsch. GP\nPlayoff bound Dallas are aiming for the top On Sunday evening Dallas battered Texan rivals Houston Dynamo 4-1 — always a satisfying scale of victory in the contest for the el capitan cannon that the winners of this annual series claim, but especially gratifying in confirming Dallas’s playoff place for the second straight year under Oscar Pareja.\nDallas have had a couple of difficult losses on the road against playoff rivals Sporting KC and LA Galaxy in recent weeks and with a two game series against Vancouver coming up, it was vital that the young team eased nerves, got back to winning ways and confirmed their playoff spot.\nThat done — and in emphatic fashion — Dallas can start looking upwards. They still have four games to play, more than any team other than the Red Bulls, who they’re a point behind at the top of the Supporters Shield standings. And they’ll also go into the series against Vancouver with some vital momentum of the kind the Whitecaps are sorely lacking at the moment.\nWhile Dallas were sealing their playoff spot in style, and relishing the fact that the week-on-week return to playmaking influence of Mauro Diaz had come at just the right point of the season, Vancouver yet again dropped points this weekend, with a 1-1 draw against playoff chasing San Jose that realistically did neither team any good. The Whitecaps now look to be playing for a high playoff seeding rather than the Shield they were frontrunners for just a few weeks ago. They may still influence the Shield’s destination over the next couple of games, as they and Dallas could play out some sort of split series that opens the door for New York or maybe LA, but the sense that the current Vancouver might still be a year off their best is palpable.\nAs for Dallas, conventional wisdom tends to say much the same thing — their young team has come on dramatically in the last couple of years, and should have that bit more experience and quality than last year, when they were able to achieve a kind of moral parity in an away goals playoff loss to Seattle. But whether that translates into further progress against playoff hardened sides like LA, Seattle and Sporting KC, is quite another matter — Pareja’s team too may still need another year. But if they’re going to be formidable next season, they’re not far off it now.
