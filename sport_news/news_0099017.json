She was shocked,\" Miles said.\nAccording to Miles, a friend of the family filmed the proposal and uploaded it to Facebook that night.\n\"It was like a wildfire. It just took off,\" Miles said. \"I woke up this morning, and over 130,000 people had viewed it.\" \nMiles said his family is now back at home, and Triston and the baby are doing well. \nCopyright WDAM 2015.
