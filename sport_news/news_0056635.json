I'm just happy I could help out. \n\"There were nerves coming into the game from everyone but on the pitch I think we dominated from start to finish and could have had more goals. It was a great team performance.\" \nKirby, who joined from Reading after playing for the Lionesses in the World Cup, said on BT Sport: \"I'm really delighted to win the championship with Chelsea and hopefully we can do it again next season.\" \nChelsea, who play their home matches at Staines Town, are managed by the only woman boss in the FAWSL in Emma Hayes. \nTheir title-clinching win was watched by 2,710, as the women matched the achievement of Jose Mourinho's men's side last season in becoming league champions. \nHayes said: \"Everybody had contributed to this success and we deserve to be champions. I thought it was a thorough performance tonight. \n\"The girls really wanted to put on a great performance and I thought they dominated from start to finish. I knew tonight would be our night.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:04.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
