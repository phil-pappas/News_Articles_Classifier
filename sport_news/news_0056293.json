Libby Law \nTim Price and Wesko clocked the fastest time of the day to remain fifth at Pau \nJock Paget was the only one of the New Zealand riders to incur time faults, adding 3.6 penalties to his score on Clifton Signature, but sits 15th. Blyth Tait and Lucy Jackson were both clear and inside the time on Bear Necessity V and Bosun respectively - both horses impressive on their four-star debuts. \nAll together, there were 28 clear rounds from the 47 starters, 15 of those inside the time. Pierre Michelet's track was shorter by 24 seconds than last year and the time allowed of 11 minutes 38 seconds proved easily achievable on the good footing; several riders enjoyed the luxury of being able to take the long option at the last complex at fence 27 and still finish comfortably inside the time. \nJung's first round on fischerRocana FST was sheer poetry; the Olympic and triple European champion rides the mare with the lightest of contact and has an extraordinary eye for distances, flying the fences spectacularly with hardly a pull on the reins. Libby Law \nMichael Jung and fischerRocana FST were poetry in motion, putting their recent cross-country mishaps behind them \n\"At both of her last two events she has had problems at water, so for the first three minutes today I gave her more time to make sure she was feeling confident,\" said Jung of his Kentucky CCI4* winner, who was retired at Luhmuhlen in June when she stumbled in water, and was eliminated at Burghley last month when she fell in water, causing Jung to break his ankle. \nHe had to work a bit harder on Halunke FBW; the white-faced black gelding had some time off after winning the European title in 2013 and is a heavier type to steer, but although his name means \"rascal\", the 11-year-old proved perfectly well-mannered at his first CCI4* and finished just one second over the optimum time. \n\"I was a little too slow at the beginning because it's his first first-star,\" said Jung. \"He's a big, strong horse and I have to prepare him for the distances more than my other horse.\" FEI/Trevor Holt \nMichael Jung held on to his lead on Halunke FBW at Pau, on the horse's four-star debut \nHowever, tonight's show jumping phase promises to be a thriller as Jung does not have a fence in hand over CCI4* first-timer Emily King (GBR), who rode with skill and bravery beyond her 19 years to bring Brookleigh home clear inside the time and hold on to third place. Close behind her is France's Astier Nicolas, on Piaf de B'neville, and these two will feel the pressure from Price as he is less than a rail behind both of them. \nEquestrian Sports New Zealand high performance director Sarah Dalziell said the course had provided moments of drama and carnage. \n\"The problems were primarily at those we expected them to be,\" she said. Dalziell says both Price and Todd could anticipate a top placing, as Wesko and Campino are careful and consistent show jumpers. FEI/Trevor Holt \nBritish teenager Emily King rode with maturity and confidence to sit third on Brookleigh \nResults after cross-country \nMichael Jung (GER), Halunke FBW, 34.9, 1; fischerRocana FST, 35.4, 2; Emily King (GBR), Brookleigh, 38.3, 3; Astier Nicolas (FRA), Piaf De 'neville, 38.5, 4; Tim Price (NZL), Wesko, 40, 5; Tim Lips (NED), Concrex Bayro, 40.9, 6; Paul Tapner (AUS), Indian Mill, 42.3, 7; Karim Florent Laghoua (FRA), Entebbe De Hus, 42.6, 8; Bill Levett (AUS), Shannondale Titan,42.9, 9; Andreas Dibowski (GER), FRH Butts Avedon, 42.9, 10. \nFor more like this, see NZ Horse & Pony magazine, new issue out now - NZ Horse & Pony", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:09:49.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
