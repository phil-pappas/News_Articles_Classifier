Thus, it seems an appropriate time to submit my midseason \nreport card on North Carolina’s seven Football Bowl Subdivision teams. \nAppalachian State (A+) — The Mountaineers were clearly out of their league against Clemson, but otherwise have performed exactly as expected in rising to the top of the Sun Belt Conference standings. Thursday’s triumph over Georgia Southern was huge. \nCharlotte (C+) — After opening with two straight wins, the 49ers have now lost four straight. But they were competitive in their first two Conference USA outings, losing to Florida Atlantic and Old Dominion by just 13 total points. \nDuke (A) — The Blue Devils are no longer a fluke, and they’ve proven it again by riding a stellar defense to a share of first place in the ACC Coastal Division. So far, Duke has exceeded preseason expectations that had it finishing fourth in the Coastal. \nEast Carolina (B) — The Pirates could have gotten a much higher grade, but so many narrow losses, especially to Navy and Temple in American Athletic Conference play, knocked them down several notches. \nN.C. State (B) — The Wolfpack got my hopes up with its 4-0 start, then disappointed by opening ACC play with two straight setbacks. I picked N.C. State to finish third in the ACC Atlantic Division, so at this stage it’s not met expectations. But State has always been a second-half team, so the best may be ahead. \nNorth Carolina (A-) — Boy, if only UNC had won that opener against South Carolina, which it should have done. The Tar Heels have positioned themselves to compete for the ACC Coastal title. Not bad for a team picked to finish fifth in the preseason poll. \nWake Forest (C+) — Overachieving at times, like against Florida State, and underachieving at others (UNC) was the pattern in the first half for the Deacons. Their three wins probably exceeded expectations, but not by much. \nAnd for the first-half individual awards: \nCoach of the Mid-Year: Appalachian State’s Scott Satterfield, Duke’s David Cutcliffe and UNC’s Larry Fedora all deserve mention. But ECU’s Ruffin McNeill has dealt with losing his starting quarterback and still kept the Pirates winning. \nOffensive Player: A toss-up between Appalachian State running back Marcus Cox and N.C. State’s Matt Dayes. \nDefensive Player: No contest. Duke safety Jeremy Cash has been simply dominant. \nStaff writer Sammy Batten can be reached at battens@fayobserver.com or 486-3534.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:37:09.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
