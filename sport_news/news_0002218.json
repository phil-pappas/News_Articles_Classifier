After Keating tied the game, Hayden McCool would restore Windsor's lead just over a minute later. \nDante Salituro scored his fifth of the year on the power play to send the teams into the third tied. \nLeo Lazarev made 27 saves for the win, while Windsor's Michael Giugovaz turned aside 23 shots. \nOttawa hasn't lost since opening the season with three-straight defeats.
