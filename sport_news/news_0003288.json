Tekac also kicked a 33-yard field goal in the game. Rob Gantt/Gazette × Sometimes, just when you think you have things figured out, life throws you a curve. \nNEXT GAME \nWHO: Monmouth at Charleston Southern \nWHEN: Oct. 10, noon \nWHERE: Buccaneer Field In mid-August, Tyler Tekac was enrolled as a student at South Carolina with the expectations that he would get a walk-on opportunity as a placekicker with the Gamecocks. Six weeks later, Tekac was kicking two field goals for Charleston Southern in the Buccaneers’ 33-20 win over The Citadel. It was his first-ever action in a college football game. The former Stratford High star, who was the placekicker for the 2014 Shrine Bowl team last December, had dreamed of playing college football. When he was asked by South Carolina’s special teams coordinator Joe Robinson last winter to walk-on, he jumped at the opportunity. Only he never got the chance. “I enrolled, got moved in and started classes, and then they told me things had changed and to check back in January,” Tekac said. While on a visit home, Tekac ran into Jon Davis, whose son J.D. is the starting quarterback at Stratford this season. Davis is the campus minister at Charleston Southern and after hearing Tekac’s story, introduced him to CSU special teams coach Dave Padilla. By the time CSU started classes, Tekac was enrolled and trying out as a walk-on for head coach Jamey Chadwell — three weeks after practices had started. “They told me I had to start at the bottom of the totem pole and they would give me a chance,” Tekac said. “That’s really all I wanted, a chance.” Tekac began to compete with CSU’s returning placekickers — Bryan Jordan and David Kennedy. As CSU struggled to make kicks in the first three games of the season, Chadwell gave Tekac a longer look in the days leading up to the game with The Citadel. “After the ETSU game, we just opened up and had a competition and Tyler really did well so we figured, why not give him a chance,” Chadwell said. “We’ve just not been very good early on so we gave him a shot and he ran with it. Competition is good and having Tyler here, I think, has made all of them better.” Chadwell told Tekac he would get the nod a day before Saturday’s game so, as the coach put it, “he could throw up and get all the nerves out of the way.” Tekac, who was not even listed on the official game roster and wore number 62, admits to feeling some nerves. After all, he was making his first college appearance before nearly 12,000 fans in a heated rivalry. Hardly Clemson versus South Carolina, but big nonetheless. He missed his first opportunity, pushing a 41-yard attempt to the right in the first quarter. He also had an extra point blocked, but the block was due to a low snap. “Both of his first two were bad snaps so it really wasn’t his fault,” Chadwell said. “I just told him to keep his head up and he would get another chance. He was going to be our kicker for that game, regardless.” A 37-yard field goal in the third quarter gave Tekac his first college points and brought CSU to within a point at 17-16. Early in the fourth, a 33-yard boot made the score 20-19. “After the first one went in, I really felt the weight come off,” Tekac said. “I was really relaxed from then on.” Chadwell says Tekac will remain as the starting placekicker for the foreseeable future. Tekac can’t help but laugh when he thinks about how things came to be, but feels he is in the right place. “God had a plan for me and I wake up every day and thank him for giving me this opportunity,” he said. “I’m going to work hard and make the most of it.” Enlarge Tyler Tekac File Photo \nTyler Tekac File Photo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:22:59.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
