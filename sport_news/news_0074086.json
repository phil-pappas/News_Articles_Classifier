So in the week leading up to Saturday’s game against Elmwood Park, the Lodi coached turned wide receiver Dayshawn Cunningham into a running back.\nThe move helped the Rams (1-3) earn their first victory.\nCunningham paired with quarterback Steven Villa, a converted tailback, to power Lodi to a 35-14 win over the Crusaders (0-4).\n\"We had our little mistakes still, even though we still came out with the win,\" Villa said. \"We’re ready to clean it up and keep it moving.\"\nVilla ran for 202 yards on 17 carries with two touchdowns, and Cunningham finished with 135 yards on 12 carries and one touchdown. Villa also threw two touchdown passes.\n\"Steven’s done it all year,\" Tirico said. \"He’s had over 100 yards each game so far this year. He’s just rolling along being a good leader for us. And he’s throwing the ball a little better each time. …We took our best athlete and made him quarterback.\"\nTirico has a young Lodi team, one that went winless through its first three games against Hawthorne, Garfield and Rutherford. But each week, Tirico’s seen improvement.\nOn Saturday, Villa and Cunningham made sure Lodi’s losing streak would come to an end.\nVilla scored on a 16-yard run early in the game, then had a 6-yard touchdown run later in the period to give Lodi a 12-0 lead going into halftime.\nBut Elmwood Park came out strong in the second half.\nThe Crusaders had a third-and-10 at their own 48-yard line when Kevin Perez broke up the left sideline for a 52-yard touchdown run. Elmwood Park converted a two-point play to cut its deficit to four.\nBut Villa responded with a pair of touchdown passes. He hit wide receiver Carlos Peppin for a 12-yard TD pass, and Cunningham for a 36-yard score.\nDelvin Matos had a 2-yard touchdown run for Elmwood Park, but the Crusaders couldn’t dent their deficit any further.\nLodi running back Cole Villacis late in the fourth quarter sealed the Rams’ win.\nCunningham was outstanding on both sides of the ball, breaking up several passes with strong coverage at cornerback.\nBut his work on offense, in his first game this season at running back, helped propel Lodi along with another strong performance from Villa.\n\"It’s just in the back of my head, so now it’s going to keep pushing me,\" Cunningham said. \"Next week, I’m just going to go harder. We’ve all got to go harder.\"\nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:21:47.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
