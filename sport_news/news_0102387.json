Stacy Long \nTHE GAME \nRecords: ASU (2-3, 2-2 SWAC), SU (2-2, 2-0) \nOn the air: TV -- none; Radio -- WQKS-FM 100.5, WKXK-FM 96.7, WKXN-FM 95.7, WJAM-FM 96.3 \nTwitter: @kamarrid, @MGMsports \nFOUR-DOWN TERRITORY ASU coach Brian Jenkins says he hopes the Hornets are praying for Southern receiver Devon Gales, who suffered a spinal injury in a game at Georgia last month. Stacy Long \n1. Prayers for SU: Though the Hornets face the Jaguars on Saturday, they say they're also praying for them. Southern receiver Devon Gales suffered a major spinal injury in a 48-6 loss at Georgia on Sept. 26 and is paralyzed below the chest. He remains in an Atlanta hospital. “I pray to God that everything goes right for him and his family,” ASU linebacker Kourtney Berry said. “I understand it may not make sense now, but I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. Regardless of what that reason is, you have to stay faithful. You have to believe that something is planned for you.” Gales was hurt making a block on a second-half kickoff return. “My heart goes out to Southern University,” ASU coach Brian Jenkins said. “I have to say they've done a first-class job of supporting that family and making sure that young man has everything he needs. Hopefully, here at Alabama State, we'll be able to make some type of contribution or do something to help that family.” ASU coach Brian Jenkins says that Southern's Willie Quinn is one of the most explosive players in the SWAC. Stacy Long 2. Small package: Southern receiver Willie Quinn measures just 5-foot-5 and weighs 145 pounds, but he shouldn't be missed. Quinn has scored four touchdowns this season, including two on kickoff returns, and threw for a TD, too. The 89-yarder is the longest pass play in the SWAC this year. “The thing I tell people is he's been playing like that all his life,” Jenkins said. “He just didn't turn that size yesterday. He understands how to play the game, how to use that size to his advantage. He's probably the most-explosive player that will be on the field Saturday and probably one of the most explosive in the league.” Alabama State's Ellis Richardson said he and his fellow quarterbacks just try to \"stay in the moment\" and not worry about who will start each week. Stacy Long \n3. Dual threat: Alabama State had two 100-yard rushers in its last game, a 41-23 victory at Texas Southern on Oct. 1. Quarterback Ellis Richardson ran for 135 yards, barely beating running back Alex Anderson's 134. “We kind of got the run game going, and that's going to help our offense a lot,” Richardson said. “Now teams have to account for the run before they account for the pass. That's going to open up the pass.” Ah, but Anderson is a mere freshman. True freshman at that. “Down the road, he's going to be a lot better than he is right now,” Richardson said. “He may be a true freshman, but he plays like an upperclassman.” Alabama State coach Brian Jenkins said this week's quarterback race, despite Ellis Richardson's recent game success, could \"come down to the finish.\" Stacy Long 4. Think pink: ASU, for breast cancer awareness, will don some pink gear Saturday, though Jenkins wouldn't say precisely what. It's a surprise. “We're going to wear some things to support the cause,” Jenkins said. “I'm sure there are some other things that may be on the horizon to help out.” \nPLAYER OF THE WEEK \nJoshua Davis \nWR, 6-0, 187, So. \nDavis had one catch for 49 yards at Texas Southern and has averaged 19.9 yards per catch this year. ASU will need such explosiveness to try to keep up with Southern. \nBY THE NUMBERS \n50: Points scored by Southern in each of its first two Southwestern Athletic Conference games. \n2: Times ASU has beaten the Jaguars over the last nine years. \n3: Combined margin of victory by ASU in those victories. The Hornets won 21-19 in 2010 and 31-30 in 2012. \n2012: The last time ASU had two 100-yard rushers in a game like they did Oct. 1 at Texas Southern. \n118, 106: Yards rushing for Isaiah Crowell and Greg Jenkins, respectively, in ASU's 27-25 home loss to Tuskegee in the 2012 season finale. \n135, 134: Yards rushing for Ellis Richardson and Alex Anderson, respectively, in ASU's 41-23 win at Texas Southern on Oct. 1. \nPREDICTION \nIs it too soon for the Hornets to have a record book for their ASU Stadium? It opened in 2012. So far, ASU's worst loss in it is 34-10 to Grambling in September and the most points allowed was in a 48-42 overtime win over Prairie View A&M in 2013. Well, history will be made Saturday. Southern 47, Alabama State 20.
