The goal is to not lose these donors.\"\nCarl Panek is one of those dedicated donors. He donated blood in Hinsdale every two months for a good 30 years, he said.\nHe planned to donate platelets last month, but when he called to make an appointment, to his surprise, he got a recording saying the donor center was closed.\nPanek, chairman of the Westchester blood program, will continue to donate blood.
