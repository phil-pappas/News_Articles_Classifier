Torres talk with Florida Tech head football coach Steve Englehart about last week's victory and the road ahead to Mississippi College on Saturday. Video by Rob Landers. Posted Oct. 21, 2015 \nThe date was Sept. 26 and the Florida Tech defense had just given up 55 points and 650 yards in a loss to North Alabama. \nThe Panthers were 1-3 on the season and coming off the worst loss in over a year. The season was in doubt. \n“We gave up way too many points to North Alabama and it was big mistakes of not being disciplined,” linebacker Nate McDowell recollected Wednesday. “That’s really when (defensive) coach (Willie) Tillman preached discipline and doing your job because one little mess up and you can mess up the whole defense and that can change the whole game. We could have had them if those didn’t happen.” \nThe defense decided that day that things had to change. \n“They really stepped up,” Florida Tech football coach Steve Englehart said. “They’re backs were against the wall after that game and they have come out on fire the past several weeks.” \nSince that North Alabama game, the defense has given up an average of 19 points per game and has given up just one touchdown in each of the past two games. \n“Really it was a wakeup call for them but also our coaches seeing some things and really focusing on some things that we need to be doing in certain areas of our defense,” Florida Tech football coach Steve Englehart said. \nAnd they all say it goes back to discipline. The defense has become a very disciplined group as missed assignments, tackles and penalties are all down. \n“It has been a lot about discipline and coaches expect nothing less than perfection, or close to it,” McDowell said. “We grind it out in practice and make sure we are wrapping up. Tackling is essential. We do our job and that shows in games. I hope that we can keep it up and I know we will as long as we do what we have to do every week.” \nAnd coach Englehart said it goes back to just playing sound football. \n“It’s really about the fundamentals and basics of lining up and tackling and they are doing that stuff really well. They are pursuing the football and getting turnovers. They are playing really well.” \nThe group has grown up together and are finally playing the way that they thought they could for the past year. \n“The big difference is maturity, we are all getting older,” McDowell said. “That synchronization, we have been around for a while and a lot of us came in as redshirt freshmen and we are still playing together besides a few transfers. That comaraderie is what really pushes us, we know each other so well. It is a good thing.” Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1LP2H07 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:56:15.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
