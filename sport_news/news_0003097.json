This website has been redesigned to help patients gain a better understanding of treatment techniques for mutilated hand injuries, stiff digits, firework injuries, secondary reconstructions and other complex hand injuries. Dr. Norman Weinzweig also has a personal website NORMANWEINZWEIG.COM that discusses common and complex hand injuries. Dr. Weinzweig created both websites as a resource for patients to learn more about the causes and treatments of hand conditions so they can advocate for their own best care.\nThe hand consists of numerous complex structures such as soft tissue, bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles, nerves and blood vessels. These structures work in unison to create proper hand function. Due to the complexity of the structures, acute or chronic injury can occur. Through the website, patients and medical professionals can increase their knowledge of the hand to understand what can go wrong and what the treatment options are.\nDedicated to education, Dr. Norman Weinzweig’s websites provide patients with insight and practical knowledge on common conditions associated with the hand such as:\nCarpal tunnel\ndeQuervain’s Syndrome\nStiff digits\nBurn Injuries\nArthritis\nMutilated Hands\nTrigger Finger\nTrauma Injuries\nNot all hand injuries require surgery. Many problems can be treated non-surgically with medication, occupational therapy or casts. When non-surgical treatment does not alleviate pain, or immediate surgery is required, it is important that patients are treated by a highly qualified and experienced hand specialist to ensure optimal results.\nAcute and chronic hand injuries can be extremely debilitating and difficult to treat. Norman Weinzweig, MD and his team are dedicated to providing excellent care to all patients suffering from simple and complex hand injuries.\nAbout Dr. Norman Weinzweig\nA nationally and internationally-renowned surgeon, educator, author and lecturer, Dr. Norman Weinzweig has contributed extensively to the fields of plastic surgery and hand surgery with 104 articles in peer-reviewed journals, 38 book chapters, 87 scientific abstracts, 5 educational videotapes, and over 250 regional, national and international presentations.
