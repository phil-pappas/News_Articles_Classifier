Blatter was questioned by Swiss investigators on Friday about why FIFA paid 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) to UEFA President Michel Platini in 2011 for work supposedly carried out at least nine years earlier. (AP Photo/Michael Probst) \nZURICH (AP) — Sepp Blatter says soccer officials have a “moral duty” to ensure more women are hired for leadership jobs, in written comments that did not address his own embattled presidency. \nBlatter told FIFA staff earlier this week he’s determined to remain in power until February’s emergency presidential election despite being under criminal investigation for financial wrongdoing. \nBlatter had to speak through his external lawyers, rather than using FIFA’s communications machine, to issue Monday’s statement. \nBut it was business as usual Friday for Blatter as he retained his column in FIFA’s in-house magazine, where he called on football to “break the cycle that makes it so much easier for men to ascend to positions of responsibility.” \nBlatter says the sport “needs more women in leadership.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:30:01.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
