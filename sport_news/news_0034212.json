Follow the links from the site’s homepage. \nThe city invites all residents to learn more about the crossing study at a community open house 6:30 p.m., Nov. 19 at Tibbetts Creek Manor, 750 17 th Ave. N.W. \nThe city promised it would provide an overview of the study’s findings and recommendations, as well as answer questions. \nIncluding both the consultant report and the study of city staffers, the report runs to some 181 pages. \nThe report covers the following general areas: Northern Issaquah, the Highlands, South Cove, the Newport corridor, Talus, Squak Mountain and downtown. \nThe Newport Way corridor will no doubt receive lots of attention from the public. Public outcry for some sort of traffic safety measures reached a crescendo following the death of 4-year-old Haochen Xu after an accident at the intersection of Newport Way Northwest and Northwest Oakcrest Drive in late June. \nAccording to the study, all the intersections looked at meet national standards. However, consultants wrote that enhancements could be made to help both the visibility and usability of the crossings. \nMayor Fred Butler promised the study’s completion by the end of September, a deadline that was met, though just barely, said Emily Moon, deputy city administrator. \nAny delays were due to some heath issues suffered by the consultant completing the study, Moon added. \nButler announced at an open house in July that he would recommend a lowering of the speed limit on Newport Way. City Council since has sliced the speed limit from 40 mph to 30 mph. \nCity officials later announced the crosswalk study would encompass more than 20 intersections around Issaquah. City staffers were to look at numerous additional crossings in less detail. Other Stories of Interest: Emily Moon , Haochen Xu , intersections , Issaquah , Newport Way , Oakcrest Drive.
