A few drops began to fall just as the last event was starting.\nDon't forget, it was the lucky 13th year for the event.\nMany of the 3,200 participants showed up in costume for the half marathon, 10K, 5K and kids half-mile runs.\nThe theme for this year was \"under the big top,\" thus the proliferation of clowns, bearded ladies and circus animals.\nAnd then there was Diana Guy dressed as Multnomah Falls (see her photo in the slideshow above). Flanked by her clown-dressed friends, Stephanie Garbuio and Sarah Hallberg, Guy said she had precedence to uphold.\nSince her first Run Like Hell five years ago, she's always come dressed as an Oregon icon. Her friends say she wins the costume contests each time.\nLast year, Guy was a gallon of Tillamook ice cream. The year before, the Made in Oregon sign. The year before that? A MAX train.\nRun Like Hell 2015 The 5K participants, some in the spirit of Halloween, start their race in downtown Portland during Run Like Hell. The event features a half marathon, 10K, 5K and kids half-mile.\nThe Ortega family came with a different kind of ambition. Three generations of their family have participated in the fun run.\nAdam Ortega, looking like the protective father unicorn that he was (complete with a pink mane), was there to help his three-year-old daughter A'rie (an adorable purple unicorn) run the kids half-mile race. In his arms for now was three-month-old son Caez. The children's older sister was running the 5K with their grandmother.\nBaby Caez, not to be outdone by his sisters, ran in the Shamrock Run this year while in the belly of his mother, Regan Ortega.\n--Stephanie Yao Long\nsyao@oregonian.com\n@stephyaolong", "external_links": ["http://terrapinevents.com/event/run-like-hell-portland-half-marathon/?tab=what"], "published": "2015-10-25T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:42:37.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
