The Blue Jays became the third team to win a best-of-five series after losing the first two games at home. Bautista's homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:02:54.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
