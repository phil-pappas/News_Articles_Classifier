He also hopes that he won't be called on to have to enforce any of its provisions.\nYet he said he wants to remain familiar with the bureau's progress on the remedies to its policies, training and oversight, should he need to step in at some point.\n\"If I am ever called upon to exercise those powers,'' Simon said, \" I want to be aware of what's going on.''\nThat's how the federal judge opened a three-hour hearing in his packed courtroom on how the Police Bureau's reforms have proceeded. The settlement followed a 2012 federal investigation that found Portland police used excessive force against people with mental illness.\nThroughout statements from federal prosecutors, city attorneys and community members, the judge asked questions about the bureau's controversial 48-hour rule that allows officers who have used deadly force to wait two days until they're interviewed by an investigator. He questioned if the city's $500,000 share to support a new psychiatric emergency center in Portland is enough. And, he pressed the city for a timeline on when police will be equipped with body cameras, even though cameras are not required under the settlement.\nFederal justice officials announced they've got a meeting Thursday with city attorneys to question where the city is on writing protocol that would allow officers involved in use of force to give immediate on-scene interviews to detectives.\nU.S. Department of Justice civil rights attorney Jonas Geissler said the Police Bureau can't assume that every time officers use deadly force they could be incriminating themselves if they're forced to give a statement on what occurred. Otherwise, , he said, departments would \"create an artificial obstacle'' to obtaining crucial information.\n\"Our meeting tomorrow is us asking the city, 'What's up? Have you any revised protocols? If not, where are the barriers?'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Adrian Brown said.\nCity-hired compliance officer Dennis Rosenbaum, a criminology professor from the University of Illinois, told the judge that his team has urged the city to abolish the 48-hour rule, saying it conflicts with national best practices. He said studies have showed that officers who have had an immediate interview or provide notes soon after an incident recall those events even more clearly in a second interview, compared to officers who wait for a later interview. Of course, if an officer is physically exhausted, injured or impaired, a later interview would be warranted, he said.\nThe Portland Police Commanding Officers' Association has ratified an agreement to abolish the 48-hour rule, which awaits City Council approval, Police Chief Larry O'Dea confirmed.\nBut the rank-and-file officers, sergeants and detectives who make up the Portland Police Association - and are the ones largely affected by the rule - have a separate bargaining agreement that won't expire until the end of June 2017, association attorney Anil Karia said.\n\"The PPA's No. 1 goal is to have full and fair investigations and have officers afforded due process,'' he said. He contends that the officers involved in five shootings this year gave voluntary interviews to investigators, but federal justice officials said they weren't immediate statements. In two cases, while voluntary, statements were made after two or more days, Geissler said.\nKaria, though, did say he expects future bargaining negotiations with the city regarding officers' voluntary and compelled statements.\nDocuments to read :\n- City's compliance assessment\n-Federal justice department's compliance report\n- Compliance team's 2nd quarterly report\nBrown also told the court that the bureau has a ways to go in improving officer response to people in mental health crisis. She said dispatchers aren't trained to assess which mental health-related calls they should be dispatching specially-trained crisis intervention officers to, and these officers make up only 17 percent of the patrol force.\n\"There's still room to grow,'' she said. \"The current model is still not completely consistent with the Memphis model.''\nUnder the Memphis model, a volunteer team of specially trained crisis intervention officers are dispatched to all mental-health related calls. In Portland, dispatchers have been sending the bureau's Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team officers to a limited number of mental health calls, and only recently began including suicide-related calls to their responses.\nGeissler noted that Portland police use of force has gone down since the federal investigation began. Deputy City Attorney Ellen Osoinach reported that .25 percent of Portland police calls involve use of force, and that police use force in 2.4 percent of arrests.\n\"This case is most fundamentally a case about force,'' Geissler said. \"We should not lose the focus of this fundamental constitutional basis of the case.''\nBut he urged the bureau's force inspector to be more critical. \"The inspector frankly needs to be more candid,'' Geissler said.\nJustice officials have met with city officials and other parties to critique police oversight, and expects the city to make \"broader reform to the accountability system.''\n\"The city remains committed to achieving a trust relationship with the community,'' City Attorney Tracy Reeve said. \"We acknowledge much more work remains to be done.''\nOsoinach said the 48-hour rule has become a \"buzz word'' in the community. While she said the rule doesn't hamper the city from requiring officers who use force to give immediate statements, she said the city doesn't agree with the federal justice position, noting that many \"complex legal and policy issues'' are involved. The city also needs to consider input from the district attorney's office.\nYet Osoinach said she understands the community's concerns. \"It creates a perception that there's unfairness and the investigations aren't being conducted fairly. We certainly want to address that perception,'' she said.\nJudge Simon interrupted. \"You make an excellent point there,'' he said. \"The appearance, or the perception of fairness is oftentimes just as important as the actuality of fairness. If we had a judicial system that is really fair but is not perceived to be fair, we can't accomplish our objectives. The same is true for the Portland police.''\nRosenbaum reported on problems with the bureau's new data system that has made it impossible to access reports on 19,000 cases over six months this year. Simon said he hopes that problem is fixed by next year.\nThe Rev. T. Allen Bethel, of the Albina Ministerial Alliance's Coalition for Justice and Police Reform, said the Police Bureau has failed to hold officers accountable in the case of Thai Gurule, who was acquitted this spring of resisting arrest after he was Tased by police last year. A state judge said police didn't have a right to stop him, and used excessive force.\n\"It is instances like this that continue to erode the community's trust in the city of Portland and the Portland Police Bureau,'' Bethel said.\nBud Feuless, speaking on behalf of the Community Oversight Advisory Board, also urged the bureau to respond to the judge's concerns raised on the Gurule case. \"We watched that case and think about that case regularly...and the fear that the next time that young man might not survive that interaction,'' Feuless said.\nOsoinach signaled that the city has been in talks about reforming the police discipline and oversight system. \"It is time to take a more holistic look at the discipline system and to see where we might make changes to it,'' she said.\nBrown cautioned that the systematic changes sought in the settlement agreement will take years to be adopted. Two national consultants, a retired police chief Charlie Reynolds , and psychiatrist Mark Munetz are serving as advisers and will continue to counsel the bureau on remedies needed, Brown reported.\nSimon thanked Mayor Charlie Hales, Chief Larry O'Dea, Commissioner Amanda Fritz and City Auditor Mary Hall Caballaro for attending. All parties to the settlement are to return before Judge Simon for a second hearing on Oct. 25, 2016.\nThe judge reminded the crowd that he plays a limited role, yet is present to serve as the arbiter if anyone is concerned the city is not complying with the agreement.\n\"I hope it will never come to pass..,'' Simon said, \"but if you need me to do something that's consistent with the settlement agreement, you know where to find me.''\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["http://policeperformancesolutions.com/about.htm", "https://twitter.com/maxoregonian", "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-munetz/14/18a/41"], "published": "2015-10-22T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:22:33.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
