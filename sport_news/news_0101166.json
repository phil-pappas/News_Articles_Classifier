(AP Photo/Bill Wippert) more > By JONAH BRONSTEIN   \nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) - Yellow flags have become a red flag for Rex Ryan and the Buffalo Bills. \nThe Bills (2-2), who play at Tennessee on Sunday, are coming off a 24-10 loss to the New York Giants. The Bills committed 17 penalties for 135 yards. \nRyan, who vowed to “build a bully” when he came to Buffalo in January, downplayed the role of penalties Sunday. He defended his players for displaying fight in the loss. \nRyan’s demeanor was different on Monday. \n“The penalties is something that kind of keeps you up at night trying to think of what to do, how we can fix it,” Ryan said Monday. “It doesn’t go away by talking about it, or that would already be done.” \nPenalties have become a pattern for the Bills in the early part of the season. \nBuffalo committed 14 penalties for 140 yards in a 40-32 loss to New England on Sept. 20. Ryan said afterward the Bills needed to do a better job of controlling their emotion and aggression on the field. \nLast week, Ryan said he wanted the Bills to be the least-penalized team in the league following a 41-14 victory at Miami in which they were flagged only five times. \nThrough the first quarter of the season, Buffalo leads the NFL with 47 penalties for 428 yards. The Bills are on pace to break the records for most penalties (163) and most yards penalized (1,358) set by the Oakland Raiders in 2011. \n“Make no mistake, we are trying to get it fixed,” Ryan said. “I have talked to a bunch, some of the coaches, veteran coaches on the staff. \n“I have talked to some coaches around the league. I have put calls into the league itself. We are trying to do things. I am not going to share some of the things we are going to do physically and everything else until I have a chance to address my team.” \nBills players were off on Monday. \nRyan noted that penalties don’t always correlate with losing. He cited the Seattle Seahawks, who have led the NFL in penalties the past two seasons while advancing to the past two Super Bowls. \n“So sometimes penalties don’t tell the whole story,” Ryan said. “But sometimes they do.” \nPenalties cost the Bills on Sunday. They had two touchdowns called back and were penalized for an illegal formation on a Giants field-goal attempt that led to a New York touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:38:08.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
