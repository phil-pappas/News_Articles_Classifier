There’s a little bit of assassination by the media. Had they taken the three points against us at the end I do not think all this would have been the same. I rang Stuart and he texted back, saying he appreciated the support. I just hope he and his family are OK, that’s more important than the rugby. We’re all in this together, understanding the pressures of professional sport and what we have to deal with.” \nGatland’s has been among the names linked with Lancaster’s job, even though there is no vacancy. The Rugby Football Union started its review into England’s World Cup campaign this week. “I don’t think they can afford me,” he quipped, and even the richest union in the world would balk at the sum in excess of £1.5m the Welsh Rugby Union would demand in return for releasing the New Zealander from the remaining four years of his contract, not that either side has any desire to part company. \nWales qualified early for the quarter-finals despite a crippling injury list that reduced them to only four fit specialist three-quarters and after beating England at Twickenham by soaking up pressure, keeping in touch on the scoreboard through the boot of Dan Biggar and then clinching victory with 10 points in the final nine minutes, they look set to play with less inhibition against Australia. \n[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:11:23.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
