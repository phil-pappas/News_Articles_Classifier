But you need to adjust and get back,” said San Beda coach Jamike Jarin, referring to San Beda’s recent loss to Arellano Univesity. \nThe Red Lions are at second spot with a 12-5 card, half a game behind the Knights (12-4), but another loss will complicate their bid for a twice-to-beat advantage, since right behind them are four other teams – Jose Rizal University (11-6), Arellano University (11-6), Perpetual Help (11-6) and Mapua (10-66) all bidding for a place in the Final Four. \nOn the other side of the fence is Letran, which also regards today’ s match with the Red Lions as a do-or-die affair. \n“It will be an important game for both of us, I consider it a do-or-die game considering how the Final Four race is shaping up,” said coach Aldrin Ayo. \nMeanwhile, Management Committee chair Melchor Divina of Mapua said the net proceeds of the Letran-San Beda duel will go to former NCAA player and PBA star Samboy Lim, who is recovering from a stroke he suffered that sent him into a coma early this year. \nThe Knights grabbed the top spot after turning back the Arellano University Chiefs, 87-81, on Sept. 25. \nThe last time Letran and San Beda met on July 16, the Knights beat the Lions, 93-80. \nTwo other Final Four bidders in Arellano and Mapua face relatively lighter assignments in the two other earlier schedules today, with the Chiefs taking on the College of St. Benilde Blazers at 12 noon, and the Cardinals taking on also-ran Emilio Aguinaldo College Generals at 2 p.m.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:23:40.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
