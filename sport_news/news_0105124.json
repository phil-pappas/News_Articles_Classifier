(Photo: Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Thunder failed to make the playoffs last season for the first time since 2008-09. They were close, missing out on a tiebreaker.\nWhat’s different this season? Former Florida coach Billy Donovan replaces Scott Brooks as the man in charge for the Thunder this season. He’s walking into a more than favorable situation with Serge Ibaka and Kevin Durant healthy and ready to go.\nUSA TODAY\nMinnesota Timberwolves preview: Young talent soldiers on without coach\nHow good canthey can be? The Thunder have the talent to beat any team in the league on any given night. Durant and guard Russell Westbrook are both top-five players when at full health. Ibaka completes the trio with his dominant defensive skill set.\nHow far they have to go: In hopes of re-signing Durant at the end of the season, they have a long journey ahead. In hopes of finishing better than last season, the journey is much shorter. As long as Durant, Westbrook and Ibaka can stay healthy, they will be a sure playoff team this year. The question will be: Do they have the extra pieces to make a postseason run?\nUSA TODAY\nUtah Jazz preview: They could be the surprise team of the year\nKeeping Durant in Oklahoma City: July 1, 2016, is a date the Thunder faithful have been dreading for years and a date just about every fan — of every team, in every city — has been looking forward to: the day Durant becomes a free agent. Will he pull a Kobe Bryant and spend his entire career on one team? Will he follow the likes of LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony and fly the coop? It’s safe to say that it will depend on how successful Oklahoma City is this season.\nDonovan to the big leagues: Donovan spent 19 years at Florida and won two NCAA championships (2006, 2007) and made four Final Four appearances (2000, 2006, 2007, 2014). He could definitely be an upgrade on the Thunder sideline. Fun fact: During the 2006-07 championship run, the Gators knocked off Westbrook and UCLA in the semifinals.\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S2BYhz&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c5f8688c88ed6f335be5a4a0a62153f6d9ed12d/c=327-0-2327-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812807030439025-USP-NBA--Preseason-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-at-Utah-J.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/66e577052748cfb21d70c23bf229b6417e305233/c=382-0-3856-2612&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809457786591166-USP-NBA--Oklahoma-City-Thunder-at-Denver-Nuggets.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809457786591166-USP-NBA--Oklahoma-City-Thunder-at-Denver-Nuggets.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e4dfe71447efa4592267c5cb9115edf91933b706/r=500x335/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809457786591166-USP-NBA--Oklahoma-City-Thunder-at-Denver-Nuggets.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dfae5132133aa2c920b7227700c2c8c6a54c079a/c=0-340-2198-2538/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812815924992041-USP-NBA--Preseason-Minnesota-Timberwolves-at-Toron.jpg", "http://imgur.com/9ARqzXs.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S2BYhz&text=Oklahoma%20City%20Thunder%20preview%3A%20Look%20out%2C%20they%27re%20back&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-24T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:12:26.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
