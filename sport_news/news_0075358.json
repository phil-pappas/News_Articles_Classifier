Their guys are tough and well disciplined, and that's what they do.\"\nThe Patriots stuck to the plan and came away with a hard-fought 31-27 victory over the visiting Falcons on a beautiful Homecoming afternoon.\n\"Plans don't always come together,\" Scarborough said. \"This one did.\"\nThings didn't look to be going well for the Patriots early on. Cox jumped out to a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter. The Falcons (5-2, 4-1) scored on a 15-yard pass play from Cole Johnson to Jake Wallace with 2:09 left in the first quarter.\nCox then put together a five-play, 53-yard drive that took only 1:11 off the clock, culminating in a 19-yard touchdown run by Matt DeMasi.\nFirst Colonial (4-4, 2-3) took over after the kickoff at their own 39-yard-line and, behind the power running of Rayshawn Steverson, marched down the field before Caleb Saar hooked up with Isaiah White on a 16-yard scoring strike to cut the deficit to 14-7.\nCox had opportunities to add to its lead after a fumble recovery and interception put the Falcons in good field position. But penalties, dropped passes and untimely turnovers kept the score close.\n\"We were just undisciplined,\" Cox coach Bill Stachelski said after a Falcons fumble negated good field position late in the second quarter. \"That's the same way we practiced all week - undisciplined.\"\nBut Cox kept fighting back.\nAfter an interception by Da'Jon Askew gave the Falcons the ball at their own 29, Cox drove to midfield with five seconds to play in the half.\nBut Eryk Britt, First Colonial's freshman cornerback, stepped in front of a Cole Johnson pass at his own 40 and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown to pull the Patriots within a point.\n\"The game really swung in our direction at that point,\" Scarborough said. \"And that's what rivalries are all about.\"\nThat momentum carried over into the third quarter as First Colonial scored on a 29-yard scamper by Jamaal Lopes and a 6-yard run by Saar to stretch its lead to 28-14.\nOn the first play of the fourth quarter, Cole Johnson hit Marcus Johnson in stride for a 67-yard Cox touchdown strike that cut the deficit to 28-21.\nA 34-yard field goal stretched First Colonial's lead to 31-21 with just less than five minutes remaining.\nCox took over after the ensuing kickoff at its own 38-yard line and promptly marched the length of the field before scoring on an 8-yard pass from Cole Johnson to Marcus Johnson. The score trimmed the deficit to 31-27 with just more than three minutes remaining. When First Colonial was unable to move the chains, Cox took over on its own 40 with 1:46 to play.\nThe Falcons were able to drive all the way to the First Colonial 23-yard line with 42 seconds left before First Colonial's defense stiffened.\nWith Cox facing a fourth down and 10 and only 10 seconds left, First Colonial's Tayvion Robinson charged through to sack Johnson and end the game.\nSteverson ended up with 108 yards rushing on 26 carries to carry First Colonial's smash-mouth attack. Cole Johnson completed 18 of 30 passes for 297 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. DeMasi had 14 rushes for 48 yards and a score.\nKey stats: C - Johnson 10 rushes, 45 yards; Wallace 8 receptions, 108 yards, TD; Marcus Johnson 3 receptions, 86 yards, 2 TDs, Askew three receptions, 44 yards. FC - Cooper 5 carries, 20 yards; Lopes 1 carry, 29 yards, TD; White 1 reception, 16 yards, TD.\n1 of 5 photos: Cox's Matt DeMasi gets the ball inside the pylon for a first-half touchdown at First Colonial on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015.
