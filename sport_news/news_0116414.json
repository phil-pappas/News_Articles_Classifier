Criminal charges against a former high school janitor who was allegedly found with a pound of pot in his car have gone up in smoke.\nSubrotha Sarkar, 28, was initially charged with driving with a suspended license, possession of a felony weight amount of marijuana and other counts after his traffic stop on Jan. 9.\nHe also allegedly had dozens of oxycodone pills in his car but his attorney said they were able to provide a prescription for them — he was taking them as a result of an injury.\nA criminal complaint against him says cops also found scales and baggies, apparently for packaging the hefty amount of reefer.\nBut Sarkar — who worked at Murry Bergtraum High School before he was fired over the arrest — is now in the clear after a longer-than-usual wait.\nSarkar was never indicted, even though formal charges are supposed to be brought in felony cases within six months.\nIn court Thursday, prosecutors said only that the case could \"not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and did not account for the delay or say why specifically the charges were being dropped.\nSarkar’s attorney Paul Prestia said he believes the case was tossed because it was an improper police stop, and that prosecutors should have thrown the case out much earlier.\nThe DA \"had to know right away after interviewing the officer that they didn't have a reason to stop his car,\" said Prestia, who represented Kalief Browder, the young Bronx man who was severely abused while being held at Rikers Island three years as a teen before Bronx authorities dropped the charges against him.\nTragically, Browder committed suicide in June.\nSarkar's case echoes current sentiment about the rights of the accused both in and out of jail, Prestia, who still represents Browder's family, argued outside the courthouse.\n\"There's so much conversation right now about speedy trial time and speedy trial violations and the district attorney having an obligation to fairly and justly uphold the laws of this state and fairly and justly prosecute individuals charged with crimes,\" Prestia said.\nAlthough Sarkar was not held on bail like Browder was, he still has \"the same rights as someone who is\" in jail, the lawyer added.\nSarkar said his life was on hold while his case remained on the docket.\n\"I can't get a job because it's an open case. My parents are getting on me because I lost this job,\" he said.\n\"They're wondering what's going on with me.\"\nSarkar is hoping he'll be able to get his job back as a result of the dismissal. He took on a nighttime security gig while the case was pending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:39:34.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
