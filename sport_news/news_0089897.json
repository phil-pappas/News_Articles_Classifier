The game was the 2015/2016 home opener for the Canucks. \n“We have got to be better in the third period,” Vancouver coach Willie Desjardins said after the game. “We didn’t have as good a third period. They played well, but we gave them a lot of transition, we quit putting pucks behind their D and they started coming at us. \n“It was nice to get one point, but I think that is a game where you have to find a way to get two.” \nJohnny Gaudreau beat Vancouver goalie Ryan Miller at 3:03 of overtime after he stripped the puck off Canucks forward Brandon Sutter. \nIt was the Canucks’ first taste of 3-on-3 overtime. Daniel Sedin had a chance to win it earlier in OT, but was stopped in close by Calgary goalie Jonas Hiller. \n“The pass I don’t think was hard enough,” Daniel said. “Hiller was there. \n“It (OT) was fun, lots of chances back and forth. We could have gotten the win, but they were able to score.” \nSecond-period goals by Bo Horvat and rookie Jared McCann, with his first in the NHL, had given the Canucks a 2-1 lead after 40 minutes. \nBut they fell victim to a Flames team that became known for its third-period comebacks last season. Sean Monahan tied the game at 8:39 of the third period, beating Miller from in close on a set up from Jiri Hudler and Gaudreau. \n“We have to win tonight’s game when you are up 2-1,” Daniel said. “We talked about getting pucks deep and making the right plays and we didn’t do that. It’s disappointing. They came at us hard, but we have to make the right plays.” \nThe win was retribution of sorts for the Flames, who were beat 5-1 by the Canucks in the season-opener for both teams Wednesday night in Calgary. \nHorvat tied the game 1-1 on a Vancouver power play two minutes into the second period, finishing off some nice work around the net. Sven Baertschi and rookie defenceman Ben Hutton drew assists on Horvat’s first goal of the season and his first career power-play goal. \n“I thought we shut it down in the third period and didn’t play as well as we have in the past and I think that is what hurt us tonight,” Horvat said. \n“They got more pucks in deep than we did. They went on the forecheck and got as many pucks to the net as they could and they just crashed the net and I think that is something we totally got away from in the third period. We started to make plays at their blue (line) instead of getting it in deep and getting on the forecheck.” \nMcCann put the Canucks in front at 11:33 of the second, beating Hiller glove side with a brilliant quick-release shot from between the hash marks. Brandon Prust and Jannik Hansen drew assists on the goal. \n“Prustie did the work on the wall and Hansen got it to me in the middle and I didn’t think, I just tried to shoot the puck as hard as I could,” McCann said. \nMcCann raised his arms into the air and jumped into the glass along the side boards to celebrate his first NHL goal. \n“I almost blacked out to be honest,” he said. “It was a great feeling, but obviously it would have been nice to end the way we all wanted.” \nThe Flames were the much better team in the first period. Calgary emerged from that period with a 1-0 lead that would have been a lot larger if not for the solid play of Miller. \nDefenceman Dougie Hamilton opened scoring at the five-minute mark when he took a cross-ice pass from Gaudreau and beat Miller far side from the left faceoff circle. The goal came on a Calgary power play with Vancouver defenceman Matt Bartkowski serving a tripping minor. \nThe Flames outshot the Canucks 38-30. \nICE CHIPS: The Canucks played without defenceman Alex Edler, who was a late scratch due to illness. Yannick Weber took his spot in the lineup. . .Rookie Jake Virtanen was a healthy scratch for the second straight game. . .The Canucks travel to Southern California on Sunday. They play the Ducks in Anaheim on Monday night and meet the Los Angles Kings at the Staples Center on Tuesday night. \nbziemer@vancouversun.com ; twitter.com/bradziemer « Previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:07:09.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
