(AP) - New York Jets wide receiver Eric Decker remains sidelined by a sprained left knee that could cause him to miss a second straight game. \nDecker was injured in Week 2 against Indianapolis and did not play against Philadelphia on Sunday. The Jets travel to London to play AFC East rival Miami this Sunday. \nCornerback Darrelle Revis and running back Chris Ivory were limited Wednesday. Revis has a hamstring issue, but says he should be fine. Ivory is dealing with a strained quadriceps that kept him out against the Eagles although he was active. \nRight guard Willie Colon (sprained MCL) and wide receiver Chris Owusu (knee) are already out, and tight end Jeff Cumberland (concussion) and linebacker Trevor Reilly (finger infection) are unlikely to play. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:25:20.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
