History is not on Canada's side as coach Benito Floro leads his under-22 team, which includes Piette, into action against the U.S. on Thursday at the CONCACAF men's Olympic qualifying tournament THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Mark Humphrey \nHistory is not on Canada's side as coach Benito Floro leads his under-22 team into action against the host U.S. on Thursday at the CONCACAF men's Olympic qualifying tournament. \nIt's been 31 years since Canada last played men's soccer at the Games. Back then the qualifying road in North and Central America and the Caribbean was made easier by the absence of the U.S. as Olympic host. \nCanada's only other participation in the Olympic men's soccer field was in 1976 when Montreal hosted the Games. \nAt the other end of the spectrum, Italy's men have played at 15 Olympics, the U.S. 13 and Brazil 12. \nCanadian captain Sam Piette hopes to write a new chapter of Olympic qualification on the road to Rio, however. \n\"It feels like unfinished business because we came pretty close last time,\" said the 20-year-old midfielder from Repentigny, Que. \nBorn 10 years after the L.A. Olympics, Piette came within one win of making it to the 2012 Games in the last round of qualification when Canada was beaten 3-1 by Mexico in the CONCACAF semifinals. \nThe Canadian did not help their cause by giving up a stoppage-time goal for a 1-1 tie with Cuba in their last pool match. That dropped Canada out of first place in its group, consigning it to a semifinal with eventual Olympic champion Mexico. \nOnly the two finalists from CONCACAF made it to the 16-team field at the 2012 Games in London. But this time the third-place team will advance to a playoff against CONMEBOL runner-up Colombia to see who joins them. \nCanada is in Group A with the U.S., Panama and Cuba. Group B is made up of Costa Rica, Haiti, Honduras and Mexico. \nThe top two teams from each pool will advance to the semifinals in Salt Lake. \nThe Americans lost 2-0 to Canada and failed to get out of the group stage in qualifying last time. \nThis U.S. squad features rising Fulham star Emerson Hyndman, a 19-year-old midfielder who already has one senior cap and captained the U.S. side that made the quarter-finals of the FIFA U-20 World Cup. \nStanford's Jordan Morris, who has also played for the senior side, will lead the U.S. attack. \nThe American team also includes some useful MLS talent in midfielders Matt Polster of the Chicago Fire, Dillon Serna of the Colorado Rapids, Fatai Alashe of the San Jose Earthquake and Wil Trapp of the Columbus Crew. \nMontreal Impact defender Eric Miller withdrew from the U.S. squad due to injury. \n\"We know it's a good team,\" U.S. coach Andi Herzog said of the Canadians. \"They had some decent results in the last couple of games.\" \nGetting players to the Oct. 1-13 tournament wasn't easy because of its duration. Canada, for example, wasn't able to bring in Orlando SC star rookie Cyle Larin. Manjrekar James, who plays his club soccer in Hungary, as well at Vancouver's Kianz Froese and Sam Adekugbe were also unavailable to Canada because of club commitments. \nWest Ham defender Doneil Henry, like Piette a veteran of the last round of Olympic qualifying, is injured. \nBut there is experience. \nPiette has won 19 caps for the Canadian senior men's team. Others on the roster with senior caps are Vancouver's Caleb Clarke (two) and Jackson Farmer (one), Toronto FC's Chris Mannella (three) and Quillan Roberts (one), and Montreal's Jeremy Gagnon-Lapare (five games). \nEight others have dressed for the senior side but not seen action. \nAnd with Floro guiding both the senior and Olympic teams, the coaching message is the same. \n\"The players here are the future of Canada. He wants to teach them how we do it on the (senior) men's team so when players go to the men's team, they already know what to do,\" Piette said. \"The same strategy, the same formation.\" \nPiette is on the books of Spain's Deportivo La Coruna but is currently on loan to second-division side Racing Ferrol. \nAfter the U.S. game, Canada faces Panama on Saturday before moving to Denver to face Cuba on Tuesday. \nHost Brazil, Argentina, Fiji, Denmark, Germany, Portugal and Sweden have already qualified for the Games. The Olympic men's soccer competition is an under-23 event so players at the CONCACAF tournament have to be under-22. \nTeams can augment their squads at the Olympics with three players of any age. \nCanada's last men's game at the Olympics was a doozy — a 4-2 penalty shootout loss to Brazil in the quarter-finals of the 1984 Games. The Canadian side featured Bob Lenarduzzi, Dale Mitchell, Bruce Wilson and Paul James that day. \n___ \nCanada \nGoalkeepers: Maxime Crepeau, Montreal Impact; Quillan Roberts, Toronto FC; Ricky Gomes, Sport Clube de Mirandela (Portugal). \nDefenders:Johnny Grant, FC Montreal; Giuliano Frano, Seattle Sounders II; Jackson Farmer, Vancouver Whitecaps FC 2; Luca Gasparotto, Greenock Morton (Scotland); Skylar Thomas, Toronto FC II. \nMidfielders: Chris Mannella, Toronto FC; Mauro Eustaquio, Ottawa Fury FC; Jay Chapman, Toronto FC; Michael Petrasso, Queens Park Rangers (England); Samuel Piette (capt.), Deportivo La Coruna (Spain); Ben Fisk, Deportivo La Coruna B; Molham Babouli, Toronto FC II; Hanson Boakai, FC Edmonton; Dylan Carreiro, Dundee (Scotland). \nForwards: Anthony Jackson-Hamel, Montreal Impact; Caleb Clarke, Vancouver Whitecaps; Jeremy Gagnon-Lapare, Montreal Impact. \n———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:35:51.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
