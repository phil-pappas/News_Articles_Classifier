Rodgers Liverpool's players back boss Rodgers after Villa win Rodgers admits his future as Liverpool manager is in doubt Liverpool turnaround just a matter of time, says Rodgers Liverpool and Everton played out the sixth draw in their last seven meetings as a fiercely-contested but error-strewn Merseyside derby finished 1-1.\nDanny Ings put Liverpool ahead when he capitalised on some lacklustre Everton defending and headed in from James Milner's cross following a corner in the 41st minute.\nBut Romelu Lukaku ensured Everton took a deserved share of the spoils when he profited from Emre Can√¢s miscued clearance in first-half stoppage time.\nBoth managers named unchanged starting line-ups from their last Premier League games, which meant Everton were without defenders John Stones and Seamus Coleman, while Liverpool partnered Daniel Sturridge and Ings in attack.\nIn the ferocious intensity of the opening stages of the 225th meeting between the teams, the play was epitomised by mistakes.\nReferee Martin Atkinson allowed the contest to flow after initially being over-zealous with his use of the whistle, and Can and Lukaku began a wrestling match while James McCarthy snapped at Philippe Coutinho's heels in archetypal derby fashion.\nHalf-chances for Ings and Milner reflected Liverpool's early positive intentions but it was Everton who twice tested Simon Mignolet in the first half-hour.\nGoodison Park rose to its feet when Ross Barkley's free kick picked out the unmarked head of Steven Naismith only for Mignolet to paw the ball away.\nThe Liverpool goalkeeper was called upon again shortly after as he dived to his right to tip a McCarthy shot past the post, following some neat Everton build-up play.\n- Calamitous -\nTempers flared when Can held on to the ball to delay an Everton throw-in and both he and Barkley received yellow cards for their troubles.\nWith the momentum seemingly with the Toffees, Liverpool struck the first blow following a corner, with Barkley punished for some slack marking.\nMilner' s delivery hung in the air but Barkley, who was guilty of a similar mistake in Everton's last game, at West Brom last week, lost Ings and failed to get his head to the ball which left the Liverpool striker with a free header from close range.\nEverton's response was instantaneous, with Liverpool's defending for the equaliser also having a calamitous look about it.\nGerard Deulofeu crossed from the right and Can volleyed a panicked clearance into the chest of Martin Skrtel which saw the ball drop invitingly for Lukaku.\nThe Belgium international reacted and adeptly cracked a low left-footed shot into the corner of the net.\nLiverpool's brittle defence was ruffled by Everton's high pressing after the interval and the result was Brendan Rodgers' side hit aimless long balls, easily handled by the home side's defence, and sporadically threatened.\nChances were at a premium for both sides, although space opened up for Barkley shortly after the hour but he could only curl the ball wide from distance.\nEverton substitute Aaron Lennon unlocked the Liverpool defence 10 minutes later and Lukaku's angled drive stung the palms of Mignolet.\nAt the other end, Coutinho cut inside on to his right foot but could not find the angle to bend the ball around Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard, who was able to easily beat the ball away.\nRodgers sacrifcied Ings for Adam Lallana for the final part of the game in an attempt to get his side more presence on the ball in midfield, while Lucas was fortunate not to be shown a second yellow card.\nLukaku and Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho had to be separated by Atkinson as Roberto Martinez's side pushed for winner, but the visitors withstood a spell of late pressure to ensure the points were shared.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T21:45:22.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
