Riding on his fierce forehand and smart shot selection, the world number 137 looked on course to take the opening set without much trouble before a momentary loss in concentration saw Chrysochos come back into the tie after Adrian gifted the Cypriot a break to level scores at 3-3.\n\nBut Chrysochos couldn’t make the most of the opening as Adrian once again went on to impose his authority, breaking his rival’s serve in the seventh game and going on to wrap up the first set with an ace down the middle.\n\nStruggling to get into his rhythm under the bright sun, Chrysochos was no match for his opponent as Adrian once again raced ahead in the second set to take an early lead, breaking Chrysochos’ serve in the first game and then holding his serve to go 2-0 up.\n\nThough the 19-year-old Chrysochos tried to find his way back with a few clever drop shots that had the top-seed in trouble, Adrian, who blasted in four aces and kept the teenager on his toes with his delightful stroke play, retained control to emerge winner.\n\nDivij-Neuchrist ousted\nHowever, all was not lost for Chrysochos as he, along with Temur Ismailov, beat the top-seed pair of India’s Divij Sharan and Maximillian Neuchrist of Austria 6-7 (3), 7-6 (3), 10-7.\n\nMeanwhile, in an all-Indian affair, the Sood brothers –– Chandril and Lakshit, got the better of Somdev Devvarman and Christopher Marquis 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2).\n\nDH News Service \nResults (Prefix denote seedings): First round: Singles: 1-Adrian Menendez-Maceiras (Esp) bt Petros Chrysochos (Cyp) 6-4, 6-4; Arthur De Greef (Bel) bt Suraj R Prabodh (Ind) 6-3, 6-4; 5- Yannick Mertens (Bel) bt N Vijay Sundar Prashanth (Ind) 6-2, 6-2; Prajnesh Gunnerswaran (Ind) bt Mohit Mayur Jayaprakash (Ind) 6-4, 6-3; 6-Ti Chen (Tpe) bt Temur Ismailov (Uzb) 6-2, 6-4; Dane Propoggia (Aus) bt Gerard Granollers (Esp) 6-4, 6-3. \n\nDoubles: Sumit Nagal (Ind)/ Vishnu Vardhan (Ind) bt Michal Knoecny (Cze)/ Alexander Kudryatsev (Rus) 4-6, 7-6 (4), 10-6; Chandril & Lakshit Sood (Ind) bt Somdev Devvarman (Ind) / Christopher Marquis (Ind) 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2); Petros Chrysochos (Cyp) / Temur Ismailov (Uzb) bt 1-Maximillian Neuchrist (Aur) / Divij Sharan (Ind) 6-7 (3), 7-6 (3), 10-7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:48:47.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
