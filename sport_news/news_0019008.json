He made his way back to the bench with a little help from teammate Colin Miller and needed some help to get back to the dressing room.\nIn Marchand's absence, Brett Connolly moved onto Patrice Bergeron’s line with Loui Eriksson on the left.\nThe No. 3 line had Ryan Spooner between Chris Kelly and Jimmy Hayes. David Krejci was on a line with Matt Beleskey and David Pastrnak.\nZdeno Chara was back in practice and appears to be close to ready. The struggling Bruins host the Tampa Bay Lightning tomorrow afternoon.\nDefenseman Matt Irwin, who's had an inauspicious start with his new team — a minus-5 in the first two games — was not on the ice at today's practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:30:48.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
