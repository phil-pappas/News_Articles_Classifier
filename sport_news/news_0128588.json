The brewer of Budweiser and Stella Artois said Tuesday it had increased its offer overnight for the world's second-largest brewer and that both boards \"reached agreement in principle on the key terms of a possible recommended offer.\" AB InBev has been trying for nearly a month to get its hands on SABMiller but its previous offers have met with resistance. On Monday, it was hoping that its latest offer, which valued SABMiller at about $66.19 a share - 14 percent higher than its initial offer - would finally win the day but it still upped its offer.
