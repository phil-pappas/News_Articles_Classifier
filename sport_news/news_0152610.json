Something about Charles James allowed him to win over his Houston Texan teammates and coaches, and made the former Charleston Southern cornerback an overnight star on HBO’s “Hard Knocks” cable television series. Houston had bigger names on its roster during training camp — none bigger than Pro Bowl defensive end J.J. Watt — but no player on the Texans grabbed more air time on “Hard knocks” or won the hearts and minds of NFL fans like James did. For the past 10 years, “Hard Knocks” has gone behind the scenes with an NFL team during the preseason, showing what training camp is really like for stars like Watt and undrafted free agents like James, who are just trying to earn a spot on the 53-man roster. James, who was one of the last players cut by the Texans and has since signed with the Baltimore Ravens, became the focus of the program this year. As a result, the former walk-on at CSU became an instant celebrity. “I guess they just liked my personality,” James said in a telephone interview this week. “I had a story behind me. I was one of those guys that came to work every day and gave it my all. What you see is what you get with me. “All the stuff everyone saw was me. It wasn’t made up. It’s the way I really am, every day. I’m the same person no matter if there’s a camera on me or not.” Since the show began airing, James has seen his Twitter followers go from about 9,000 to 22,000, and he has Facebook “likes” from people around the world, he said. “People are following me more, I’ve got a lot more fans on Facebook and Twitter and I have a larger fan base,” James said. “It’s not just social network stuff. If I go out and get a bite to eat people recognize me where they didn’t before. Everyone’s been great. It’s been pretty cool.” One of the most endearing moments of the show occurred when James spoke with Denver quarterback Peyton Manning before the Texans faced the Broncos in a preseason game, calling the future hall of famer a “legend” during their brief encounter. “All that was from my heart, it’s how I really feel about him,” James said. “I didn’t even know the cameras were on me. It’s just something that I wanted to do to show him the respect that he deserves. He’s one of the best that has ever played the game.” A week later, FOX sideline reporter Erin Andrews approached James during pregame warmups, telling him she was his newest fan. “That was pretty cool,” James said. It was that kind of genuine human moment and his underdog status that had everyone rooting for the 5-9, 180-pounder to make the Texans team. That and his “Happy Socks.” James’ collection of colorful footwear captured the attention of his teammates and viewers. James said he has been sent dozens of socks since the show aired. “I’ve been doing the socks thing for a while,” James said. “That started in college when I was at Charleston Southern, but not many people paid attention to it. A lot of people have been sending me socks. I’m looking to start my own line of socks this season, hopefully in the next month or two.” Early in the preseason, Houston running back Arian Foster suffered a hamstring injury and James became a two-way player, practicing at cornerback and running back for several days. In the final minutes of the Texans’ preseason game against New Orleans, James was inserted into the lineup as a running back and promptly scored on a 73-yard run the first time he touched the ball. Unfortunately, the touchdown was called back due to a holding penalty. His teammates rushed the field and mobbed James in the end zone. “That was one of the highlights of my football career at any level,” James said. “When I scored the guys on the team swarmed all over me. That was an incredible feeling because I knew they had my back. It was one of the best moments of my life so far, even though it got called back.” After not being selected in the 2013 NFL draft, James signed as a rookie free agent with the New York Giants. James didn’t make the Giants opening day roster, but was signed to the team’s practice squad. He eventually earned his way onto the Giants’ 53-man roster and played in 12 games, making four tackles. James again didn’t make an opening-day NFL roster in 2014, but got a spot on the Texans’ practice squad about two months into the season. “I didn’t come to Houston to be a ‘Hard Knocks’ star, I came to Houston to make the football team,” James said. “I have a dream and I consider myself a fighter. I walked on at Charleston Southern and I’m walking on again.” Houston coach Bill O’Brien said he wanted to sign James to the Texans practice squad this season, but James said he needed a fresh start with a new team. He signed with the Baltimore Ravens less than a day after getting released by the Texans. “Baltimore is a great place and they’ve got a great organization and I can start from scratch here and see what other people think about me,” James said.
