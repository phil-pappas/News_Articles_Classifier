Stewart and freshman cornerback Michael Hughes will be reinstated after serving a suspension due to an incident at a Franklin Street fraternity house on Oct. 4, according to university officials. \nOfficials said Hughes is eligible to participate in the Tar Heels' game Saturday against Virginia; Stewart will be reinstated Sunday and will be eligible to play Oct. 29 versus Pittsburgh. Stewart and Hughes were linked to what the incident report described as a forcible attack. \nTwo men who lived at the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house were punched, one so hard his nose was broken and knocked unconscious, according to warrants for the players’ arrest. \"I've reinstated Mike Hughes today and he will play against Virginia this week,\" head coach Larry Fedora said . \"M.J. Stewart will be reinstated on Sunday and play against Pitt the next week. Based on everything I know at this time, it was the appropriate action. They still have to go through the judicial process.\" \nStewart has recorded 20 tackles and leads the team with three interceptions. He played in 12 games last season as a true freshman for Carolina and recorded 26 tackles, four pass breakups and two interceptions. Stewart was also suspended in 2014 for UNC's season opener against Liberty due to violating team policy involving an off-field incident during fall training camp. \nHughes recorded three tackles and one pass break up in five games for the Tar Heels this season.
