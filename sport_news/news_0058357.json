Bouma rushed 20 times for 94 yards in the game and had two receptions for 80 yards. He broke free for a 14-yard run to reach the NDSU 27-yard line shortly before the game-winning kick. \n\"Something happened on that last carry,\" Bouma said in a statement. \"I couldn't explain it to you. All I remember is that I got up and it felt weird. Something was wrong, and so I went to the sideline.\" \nCoyotes coach Joe Glenn said Tuesday that Bouma was scheduled for surgery on the broken arm — the same one he broke a year ago that cut his season five games short. He'll miss the final five games again this year. \n\"The doctor said it was just a freak thing,\" Bouma said. \nThe 5-foot-11, 210-pound junior from Le Mars, Iowa, was leading the Missouri Valley Football Conference in yards per carry and was the league's fifth-leading rusher. \nThe game also was costly for NDSU, which has lost starting quarterback Carson Wentz to a broken throwing wrist. He'll be out for the rest of the regular season. The team hasn't ruled out a possible return for Wentz should the Bison make the playoffs. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:13:42.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
