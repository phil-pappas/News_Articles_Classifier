Vasha Hunt/vhunt@al.com ORG XMIT: ALBIN401 (VASHA HUNT) \nAlabama escaped with a 14-13 win at Arkansas last year — only after a Landon Collins interception ended a potential Razorbacks game-winning scoring drive late in the fourth quarter. \nOddsmakers don't believe this year's game will be that close. \nAlabama is a 16-point favorite heading into next week's game against Arkansas in Tuscaloosa, according to Vegas Insider. \nThe Tide (4-1) are back up to No. 8 in the AP poll after beating then-No. 8 Georgia, 38-10, Saturday in Athens. \nThe Razorbacks (2-3) have dropped three of their last four games after beginning the season with a 48-13 win over UTEP. \nHowever, No. 9 Texas A&M needed a late comeback and overtime to beat Arkansas, 28-21, Sept. 26. \nThe Razorbacks beat Tennessee, 24-20, Saturday. \nThough Arkansas is without two of its top players — running back Jonathan Williams and wide receiver Keon Hatcher — junior running back Alex Collins has run for 151 yards or more in each of the Razorbacks' last three games. \nQuarterback Brandon Allen — a three-year starter — was 20 of 25 for 225 yards with one touchdown and one interception against Texas A&M.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T00:04:23.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
