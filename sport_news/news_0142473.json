Garvey stepped into his new role well, rushing for 181 yards and three touchdowns, leading the Warriors to a 40-6 win over Drury on Friday. \nCataldi was with the team on the sideline, but was not in full uniform. Coach Gary Campbell Jr. said Garvey will be the starter moving forward, but did not elaborate on Cataldi's status. \n\"I'm ready,\" Garvey said when he received the news on moving into the backfield. \"That's where I've grown up playing, so it's not new to me.\" \nGarvey looked like a natural with the ball in his hands, scoring touchdowns on Wahconah's first and third possessions. His first score was a two-yard plunge on fourth and goal. The second was a 15-yard burst into the endzone, early in the second quarter. \n\"Evan ran hard. I'm really happy for him,\" Campbell said. \"He ran tough and I think the offensive line opened up some big holes for him. He got the bulk of the carries tonight and he looked good doing it.\" \nGarvey's touchdowns with a Patrick Butler 34-yard field goal sandwiched in between, put Wahconah up 17-0 with 10 minutes and 44 seconds left in the second quarter. After a Drury punt, Wahconah quarterback Will Genaway got the chance to show off his arm. Advertisement \nOn first and 10 from the 20, a play-action fake to Garvey, set-up a 80-yard touchdown pass to Connor Washburn. \nThaylen Harrison got Drury on the board with a 75-yard touchdown on the ensuing kickoff, cutting the deficit to 23-6. \nBut, four plays later, Genaway hit Matt Donnelly on a fade in the left side of the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown. \nAnother Drury punt led to a 25-yard touchdown run from Garvey. Butler kicked a 33-yard field goal for the final score. \nDrury could not manage any points in the second half, but coach Seth Shepard said his team can learn from facing the defending Western Massachusetts Division IV champions. \n\"I don't care about the scoreboard right now,\" he said. \"This was probably our best game of the year, against one of the toughest, best traditions there is in Berkshire County. These guys are tough. .... They're a program through and through, and I thought we played really well, especially the first couple quarters.\" ——— Drury", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:35:43.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
