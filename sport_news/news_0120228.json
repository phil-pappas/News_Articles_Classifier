I miss the days of Rex Ryan, when there was all kinds of hot air floating up from New York, working the Pats into a lather before game time. Now, what do we have? Sheldon Richardson being goaded into making “bulletin-board” statements that are really just being taken out of context? A need to put aside all respect for Darrelle Revis and focus instead on his mercenary-like business approach? The Revenge Tour felt like it concluded last week in Indy; the rest of the games are just that. Football games. Part of the regular season. Just trying to get to the playoffs, and see what happens there. Boring, isn’t it? But this game will be anything but. Rex always had his Jets ready for the Patriots, and it showed. Now, the new-look Jets have perhaps more talent and a better positioned to challenge for the division, because they’re focused on being a complete football team rather than just beating Bill Belichick. But I don’t think that starts today. Still, it should be fun. NICK FRIAR (4-1): Patriots 20, Jets 17 The Jets have always given the Patriots problems through the years, and although Rex Ryan moved north it seems New York’s defense is still a force to be reckoned with. Couple that with the fact that the Jets step up their game against New England—every time—shapes this one to be a nail biter. The numbers to know going in are that five of the last six matchups between the Patriots and the Jets have been decided by three or less points. Obviously everyone is thinking about Darrelle Revis making his return to Gillette Stadium after he used the Patriots to get his ring (or rather his mother did), and more money elsewhere. It’s unsure if he will solely get boos throughout the day, but, regardless, he probably won’t cover Julian Edelman and definitely won’t take on Rob Gronkowski. So it’ll be interesting to see how much of an impact he’ll have covering the Patriots’ deep threats. Lastly, Ryan Fitzpatrick’s track record against the Patriots isn’t superb. He’s thrown for 13 touchdowns in seven games against them, which isn’t bad, but he’s also lobbed up 17 interceptions. While he seems like a new quarterback with his new team, there’s a good shot he scuffles against New England. southcoasttoday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:30:17.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
