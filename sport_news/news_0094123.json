Riding the momentum, Johnston broke Mukherjee to start the second set, firing a fist-pump at his teammates. He closed out the match by winning the final nine games.\nBy the time the snow came and forced the action indoors, Johnston had won seven straight games.\n“I thought it was funny playing tennis in the snow,” Johnston said. “Worst possible timing. Never done that before. It was a good match to remember.\n“At the beginning of the match, I was a little nervous and wasn’t playing my best. Then I just rode the wave and I started playing my game.\n“This means the most to me. I won my last high school match. I won states at No. 2 singles as a freshman, and I never thought that would happen. This year I had a lot of expectations and a lot of pressure, but I just fought hard and played my game.”\nNovi sophomore Alex Wen fought through an illness that caused him to put down his racket for five months. A champion as a freshman at No. 3 singles, he moved up and won No. 2 singles, 6-4, 7-5, against Bloomfield Hills freshman Andrew Zhang.\n“I just played my heart out, I gave everything I could,” Wen said. “When I first stepped onto the court after taking five months off, I was devastated. I could barely hit any balls. The first tournament I went to, I lost in the finals to a kid I probably should have beat. It was bad. Now, to see I could win a state championship again is great.”\nCaptures No. 2 singles title\nZhang’s teammate, Constantine Hemmich, won No. 3 singles, 6-2, 6-3, over Novi freshman Sid Amarnath.\nNovi, the defending team champion, ended up in a battle with a young Bloomfield Hills team for the team title, while co-Day 1 leaders Ann Arbor Huron and Ann Arbor Pioneer finished in the top four.\nThe team title came down to the No. 4 singles match between previously unbeaten Brad Silverman of Bloomfield Hills and Chris Chio of Huron.\nSilverman won the first set, but lost the final two, 3-6, 3-6. The result meant that Novi and Bloomfield Hills tied at 26 for the state title.\n“It’s amazing,” said Bloomfield Hills coach Greg Burks of his team’s play. “We came to play the last couple of days. We played well through the season, but our best play was definitely in the tournament.\n“I can’t be any more pleased. We’ve got some freshmen that have held up and showed poise. In one doubles, I had a freshman (Sebastian Burman) and a junior (Alex Ross), and they beat the fourth seed in Pioneer, and that was a big upset for us.”\nBirmingham Brother Rice’s No. 1 doubles team of freshman Jarreau Campbell and senior Sean Abelarde won the flight over Troy’s Sai Kagithala and Kevin Fietsam, 6-3, 6-2.\n“We played them before, and that helped as far as strategy,” Abelarde said. “Today we just put balls on play. Our serves were on. We were aggressive. That was our plan going into it, so we stuck to our gut and got the job done.”\nHuron’s No. 2 doubles team of Austin Choi and Robert Dong beat rival Pioneer in the final, 6-3, 6-4, against Sayhann Goraya and Nico Figueroa.\nOther finals\nDivision 2 at Holly\nGrand Rapids Forest Hills Central and Portage Central tied for the team title, each compiling 30 points. Midland Dow was third with 27. Portage Central’s Bill Duo defeated Forest Hills Central’s Connor Genschaw in the No. 1 singles final, 6-4, 6-3.\nDivision 3 at Holland\nBloomfield Hills Cranbrook ended Birmingham Detroit Country Day’s four-year reign in Division 3, winning the team title with 38 points. Country Day was second with 30, but that included a one-point deduction for unsportsmanlike conduct at No. 1 singles. JP Avila of Holland Christian won that flight, defeating Cranbrook’s Marc Sable, 6-1, 6-4, in the final.\nDivision 4 at Kalamazoo College\nAnn Arbor Greenhills won its eighth straight team title with 36 points. Grosse Pointe Woods University Liggett was second with 28, and Traverse City St. Francis was third with 19. Otsego’s Luke Ford won the No. 1 singles flight, defeating Williamston’s Oliver Weaver, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-3. The No. 4 doubles flight was not completed and will be finished today, but it will not affect the top two in the standings.\nBuy Photo Snow forced the division I boys tennis finals indoors in Midland, MI on Saturday, October 17, 2015.
