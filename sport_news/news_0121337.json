Stosur beat Heather Watson 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 while Kerber defeated Caroline Garcia 7-5, 6-3. \n“I lost my way at the outset but being a three-set match, I didn’t let it bother me,” said Stosur, the 2011 U.S. Open champion. “It doesn’t matter if you don’t start fantastic, what matters is how you finish.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:14:49.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
