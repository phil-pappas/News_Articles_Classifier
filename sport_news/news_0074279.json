But even with the enhanced security measures, the location in American Legion Post 80 on Saratoga Avenue is considered a temporary spot for a field court. Officials still are reviewing other options, including the possibility of moving the traffic court to another location in southeast DuPage. \"This is not the end of the story,\" county board member Grant Eckhoff said before the judicial and public safety committee signed off on the security upgrades. \"We will still like to find a better facility ... or possibly combine Addison and Downers Grove into one facility for the east side of the county.\" In August, DuPage Chief Judge Kathryn E. Creswell called for increased security at all four traffic courts sites in Downers Grove, Addison, Glendale Heights and Wheaton. DuPage has one sheriff's deputy assigned to each of the four traffic court locations, which are used by about 300 people daily. But county officials say the Downers Grove location is the most challenging in terms of security. The money DuPage plans to spend will pay for secure doors, additional outside lighting and other changes. \"It's to upgrade and harden the facility,\" Eckhoff said. On Tuesday, Creswell said she was \"comfortable\" that the security changes to the Downers Grove site are a step in the right direction. \"For all four of the traffic courts, the goal is the same -- that everybody that enters any traffic court is screened for weapons,\" Creswell said. \"That's the ultimate goal. This is a good first step toward that.\" The project, which also received approval Tuesday from the county's public works committee, is expected to happen within 45 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:18:19.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
