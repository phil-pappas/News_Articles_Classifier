We can't wait to get him back,” Daniels said, noting Centeio was already back in school. “I expect him hopefully to be practicing Monday.”\nCenteio, who attended Thursday’s practice, but did not participate, told the Sun Sentinel, “I’ll be back soon.”\nPrior to last week’s game, senior receiver Isaiah Johnson, who has been Centeio’s top target, set aside his jersey No. 21 and instead wore Centeio’s No. 16 as a tribute. And over the past several days, Dwyer players and well-wishers expressed concern and posted get-well messages to Centeio’s Twitter timeline.\n“Waking up praying that my brother will be dismissed from the hospital soon healthy and strong. Miss my dawg man @toddycenteio,” junior linebacker Javen DiCocco wrote Saturday.\nJunior receiver Levon Barnett, after Dwyer beat Wellington 42-35, tweeted: “Did it for bro tonight @toddycenteio.”\n“Feel better toddy we did it for you today get well soon,” junior lineman Javaun Thomas added.\nIn the meantime, Class 7A’s top-ranked team has turned to another junior — Eli Mathews — to start at QB in Centeio's absence. Mathews is 17-for-22 passing, for 400 yards and five touchdowns in his first two games, according to Daniels.\n“We are fortunate to have a backup as good as he is,” Daniels said.\nCenteio, who transferred from Royal Palm in January, is regarded as one of the area’s top quarterbacks. A one-time Miami commit, he has thrown for eight touchdowns this season.\nCorrespondent Gary Curreri contributed to this report.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562023a1/turbine/fl-dwyer-qb-todd-centeio-1016-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:03:30.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
