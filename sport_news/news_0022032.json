When coaches are direct, they're straight to the point, they tell you what they want to see, and you know how to go out there and perform.\n\"Like, 'This is what we expect from you, you and you on this play.' Guys just respond to that because you give them clear direction. It's not like a bunch of fluffiness. You don't have to put sprinkles on a cupcake.\"\nLong road back: There was a rare Kevin White sighting on the Halas Hall practice field Thursday.\nThough the first-round wide receiver cannot yet practice with the team, he was able to jog and catch passes during the portion of practice that reporters are allowed to watch.\nThe seventh overall draft pick had surgery on Aug. 23 to repair hairline fractures in his left tibia.\nWhite remains on the physically unable to perform list but can begin practicing with the team anytime from Oct. 20-Nov. 10.\nOnce a player on PUP practices, his team has 21 days to activate him, cut him or move him to injured reserve.\n\"They are continuing to rehab,\" coach John Fox said. \"The training staff, they've been doing a lot of indoor work. Now he's progressing to where he can get on the grass a little bit.\"\nGood riddance: Quarterback Jay Cutler was asked if he would miss former Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who signed with the Miami Dolphins in the off-season and has been fined frequently for late hits and dirty play in the past, including one forearm shot to the back of Cutler's head in 2010.\n\"I don't think anyone is going to miss playing that guy,\" Cutler said, \"especially Kyle (Long) or me.\"\nAs a guard in his first two seasons, Long faced Suh twice a year, and he said his competitive side would miss facing Suh.\n\"When I have kids or grandkids, one day they're going to ask me, 'Who are the guys that I played against?'\" Long said. \"And Suh will be right there at the top of the list.\n\"While I understand he's down there at the beach, it'd be nice to see him at Ford Field.\"\nInjury update: Linebacker Shea McClellin (knee), safety Antrel Rolle (ankle), defensive lineman Ego Ferguson (knee) and cornerback Terrance Mitchell (hamstring) did not practice.\nWide receiver Alshon Jeffery (hamstring), linebacker Pernell McPhee (shoulder), defensive linemen Jeremiah Ratliff (ankle), and Will Sutton (elbow), offensive linemen Jermon Bushrod (shoulder) and Patrick Omameh (ankle) and (wide receiver Josh Bellamy (groin) were limited.\nâ€¢ Follow Bob's Bears and NFL reports on Twitter @BobLeGere.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
