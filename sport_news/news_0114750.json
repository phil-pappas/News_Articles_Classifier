Coming in my rookie year, he was one of the guys I looked up to. He was a good leader in the locker room and kind of showed you the ropes, on and off the ice.\" \n\"He was so good to me from day one,\" winger Brayden Schenn said. \"I wouldn't say he was hard on me, but he wanted the young guys to be respectable and play hard. He was an older guy who's been around the league for a while. Kimmo didn't talk a whole lot in the dressing room, but when he did, you sure listened.\" More coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:29:19.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
