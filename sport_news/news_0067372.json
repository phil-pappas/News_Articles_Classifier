And as he watches those players that his regime put together, he fields phone calls. \n\"I’ll talk to scouts, guys who first saw these kids,\" Minaya said. \"I’m a player personnel guy and from a player personnel standpoint you feel good about the scouts, the Larry Izzos, the Les Parkers, the Steve Barninghams. I remember them in the draft room, these guys fighting for the players and I feel good for the scouts.\" \nIt is those names, the ones you haven’t heard, that Minaya wants to be heard, now that the world is hearing the names of the players that they found. Minaya was the general manager of the Mets from 2005 to 2010, and the legacy that some believed he left behind was a free-spending era with a barren farm system. \nBut if the high-priced deals for Pedro Martinez, Carlos Beltran, Johan Santana and Jason Bay may be what have been remembered, it is the maligned farm system that he left that he takes pride in as he has moved on, now serving as a senior advisor to Tony Clark with the Major League Baseball Players Association. \nYou ask him about the players and he names the scouts — Ismael Cruz, Ramon Pena and all the others. \n\"I enjoy watching the kids,\" Minaya said. \"I call them kids because I knew them when they were 16, 17 years old. Wilmer Flores was about 16 when we signed him. Jeurys Familia was 17. [Ruben] Tejada was about 17. I enjoy seeing these kids and the memories of when they first started, but for the scouts.\" \nThe list of names doesn’t stop there. Minaya, with the work from his scouting directors Rudy Terrazas and Sandy Johnson, drafted Matt Harvey, Jacob DeGrom, Steven Matz, Lucas Duda, Daniel Murphy, Juan Lagares, Jon Niese, Hansel Robles, Familia, Flores and Tejada, among others. \nMinaya won’t brag even now and won’t ask for a reconsideration of the farm system he left behind, reluctantly taking any credit and insisting he only feels some vindication for the scouts who worked for him. And he is quick to credit the front office that took his place. \n\"You do have to give credit to Sandy [Alderson],\" Minaya said. \"Sandy made some great trades, not only at the trade deadline but before that. Paul DePodesta identified the talent. Credit goes to everybody — Sandy, Paul, J.P. Ricciardi and John Ricco. They deserve all the credit in the world.\" \nCredit, yes, but maybe not all of the credit. Alderson patiently unraveled the payroll for the financially-troubled ownership and made a series of brilliant deals, but even in the swipe of Noah Syndergaard and Travis d’Arnaud from Toronto for R.A. Dickey, it’s worth noting that Minaya’s scouts had found Dickey as he was almost out of baseball — and was even the first player cut in camp in 2010 by the Mets before making his way back to the majors — and he eventually would become a Cy Young Award winner, making the deal possible. The same goes for Beltran, whose expiring contract was shopped by Alderson, landing Zack Wheeler. And don’t forget, Houston’s 19-game winner Collin McHugh was also brought in by Minaya and released by Alderson. In Alderson’s book, Baseball Maverick, Minaya gets just a cursory mention, as Alderson’s rebuild is chronicled. \n\"There’s three ways to look at Omar’s legacy,\" said Ron Darling, who has served as an analyst for SNY through both front office tenures. \"One, he was responsible for the [Mets’] incredible resurgence. But, two, some of those bloated contracts restricted the team’s ability to correct itself quickly. And three, look at today’s roster and count how many of Omar’s draft picks are here.\" \n\"If you ask me, Omar was and is a great guy who tried to bring a quick winner to New York and almost did – he got to within one strike [in 2006]. He saddled the team with big contracts when he left, but his initial work is paying off.\" \nMinaya might feel best for the player who was drafted when he was an assistant general manager with the Mets, David Wright, having suffered through the hard times with him. \n\"David is, for me, what the game is about, all about what is good,\" Minaya said. \"I love him. We have a great relationship. I’m happy for him.\" \nStaff Writer Bob Klapisch contributed to this article.
