CPR was performed on the student before paramedics loaded him into the helicopter.\nThe game was postponed with 12 seconds left in the first half.\nThis comes just one week after a Perryton High School football player was placed in a medically-induced coma after he suffered a blow to the head during a game.", "external_links": ["http://www.myeasttex.com/news/local-news/alto-player-suffers-seizure-flown-from-game", "http://www.kltv.com/story/30284213/alto-yellowjackets-player-collapsed-airlifted-to-hospital"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:56:14.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
