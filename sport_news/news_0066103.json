Only the Ladakh MLA seat remains with the Congress.\nThe campaign for the council polls was managed by the state unit along with minister of state in PMO Jitender Singh - MP from Udhampur - and Chhewang. Reacting to the results, Singh said \"People across the country are voting BJP for its developmental agenda. The party's victory in Ladakh will echo in the results of Bihar assembly elections.\"\nBJP national vice-president and J&K incharge Avinash Rai Khanna said BJP has made history and that Congress's run of defeats since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections had not changed.\nThe council win means that BJP has established a strong foothold in Jammu and Ladakh regions of the states. Though Ladakh's electoral representation in Parliament and the J&K assembly is modest, it counts as one of three regions.\nThe success helps BJP disrupt the influence of Congress leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad in Ladakh. The former J&K chief minister had been seen as the force behind the Congress controlled hill council.\nThe win is also a culmination of a long process of BJP support to Ladakhi aspirations that saw an agitation in the early 1990s for the area to be designated as a Union Territory. Despite its stance, BJP never made lasting inroads and this is the first time it has emerged as a grass roots force.\n\"BJP had gone to the people of Ladakh during LAHDC elections campaigning with an agenda of development and providing a corruption free administration\", Khanna said and added that the voters displayed their faith in our party and rejected Congress, which always provided lip service but did nothing in practice to understand and mitigate the problems of the cold desert region.
