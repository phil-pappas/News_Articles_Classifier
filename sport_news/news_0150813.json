After all, no team could hang with them in last season's playoffs, as they steam rolled passed the Celtics, Bulls and Hawks while two of their stars nursed injuries.\nWith Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving returning to full health, as well as the additions of Mo Williams and Richard Jefferson, they're poised to be even bigger and better this season.\nMORE: Season predictions: Who wins the West? | 4 East teams with actual shots at beating the Cavs\nHowever, the NBA is a crazy place where the unexpected has a tendency to happen, leaving reason to believe the Cavaliers' return to the NBA Finals won't be a walk in the park. From Carmelo Anthony's murky future in New York to Dwyane Wade's health, there are a number of factors that could determine how the Eastern Conference shakes out and prevent the Cavaliers from a shot at retribution.\n1. Can Kyle Lowry bounce back from last season? © Provided by Sporting News For the first two months of the 2014-15 season, Kyle Lowry played like a man on a mission. He won Player of the Month honors in December, leading the Raptors to a 24-7 record out of the gates, and was named an All-Star for the first time in his career.\nThen, just as it appeared as though the Raptors were destined for a deep playoff run, it all came crashing down .\nFollowing a first round sweep at the hands of the Wizards (a series in which Lowry averaged a dismal 12.3 points on 31.6 percent shooting), he entered the offseason determined to get in the best shape of his life. And he did. While preseason performances should be taken with a grain of salt, Lowry has never looked better and his numbers — 30.3 points in 25.1 minutes per game — speak for themselves.\nIs it sustainable? It's probably safe to assume Lowry won't lead the league in scoring or emerge as a legitimate MVP candidate. If he can replicate and sustain his hot start from last season, though, the Raptors won't be pretenders for very long.\n2. Is this the season Bradley Beal breaks out? © Provided by Sporting News It should be , yes.\nBeal was drafted with the No. 3 pick for good reason — gifted shooters like him are hard to come by. He hasn't made the jump many expected him to since 2013, but Randy Wittman's affinity for long 2-pointers and a number of unforeseen injuries are largely to blame. Now that Beal is determined to change his shot selection for the better, this should be the season he flirts with an All-Star appearance.\nWorking in Beal's favor is Wittman's new system, too, which will have the Wizards running and gunning like we've never seen before. If it's as good as advertised, this could be the year they make it to the Conference Finals and give whoever they're pinned up against a run for their money.\n3. Is Paul George, power forward, for real? © Provided by Sporting News There's reason to believe Paul George playing power forward is a beneficial move for his future . But there's also reason to believe the experiment will fall flat on its face, and George vocalizing his displeasure is a good place to start.\nHaving logged 68 percent of his career minutes at small forward, it's no wonder George isn't thrilled about playing small-ball four. Instead of chasing around the Kevin Durants and Carmelo Anthonys of the world — players he's far more suited to match up with — George now draws the task of battling the likes of Anthony Davis on a nightly basis. That's a demoralizing task for anyone, mind alone a 6-9 forward who weighs 220 pounds.\nAs the cornerstone of the franchise, the Pacers would be wise to keep George happy. Figuring out whether or not shifting him over to power forward is more than just a gimmick sooner rather than later would go a long way.\n4. Will Carmelo Anthony be traded? © Provided by Sporting News Sure, Carmelo Anthony has said he won't ask for a trade if the Knicks struggle again this season — his exact words : \"No, hell no\" — but that won't prevent people from speculating all year long.\nBesides, it's not crazy to think Anthony would rather be somewhere else at this stage of his career. Even if the Knicks do make the playoffs, they're certainly not poised to upset the likes of the Cavaliers, Wizards, Hawks or Raptors in the first round. With his services, there are a number of teams that would become legitimate title contenders overnight. Sliding Anthony alongside Jimmy Butler and Derrick Rose, for example, would give the Bulls a scoring punch they've been missing.\nAnd who knows how desperate the Heat are to prove they don't need LeBron James to win another ring. Desperate enough to part ways with Justise Winslow, perhaps?\n5. Will the injury bug hit the Bulls again? © Provided by Sporting News The Bulls are in a vulnerable state. None of Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah or Jimmy Butler played in 70 games last season. Rose suffered yet another injury in preseason and, as a 29-year-old center coming off of multiple knee injuries, Noah's best days may very well be behind him. Additionally, history shows a player like Butler tends to regress , albeit slightly, from this point forward in their career.\nMost importantly, though, the Bulls couldn't take care of business in the playoffs against a beat up Cavaliers squad. How much faith should we have that the best is yet to come?\nA lot of the pressure falls on Fred Hoiberg to transform their historically stingy offense — a tall task for a coach who's never stepped foot in the NBA — but that means nothing if their stars can't stay healthy. After all, the likes of Butler, Rose, Noah and Pau Gasol will be the reason the Bulls are in the thick of things once again this season. 70-something games together to iron out the creases could be what finally pushes them over the hump.\n6. Is this the end of the Bucks' youth movement? © Provided by Sporting News Ideally, there are three stages to a rebuild. The first is rather simple: Lose games and turn them into young assets. The second is slightly more complicated: Piece parts of the puzzle together and make the jump into dreaded mediocrity. The final step is what keeps general managers awake at night: Find a way to make it all special.\nThe Bucks passed the first two stages with flying colors. Winning 84 games over three seasons landed them John Henson, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker — a trio of gangly forwards capable of leading their youth movement. Then, with Jason Kidd taking over as head coach, they won 41 games in 2014-15 and proved to be a team on the rise.\nNow, it's time to figure out if this is the start of a revolution, and it begins with Greg Monroe providing a stable punch in their offense. Because if he proves to be their missing piece, you should be worried.\n7. What does Dwyane Wade have left in the tank? © Provided by Sporting News Just when we think we've seen the last of Flash, Dwyane Wade proves us all wrong.\nThe Heat are the hardest team to predict this season because there are so many moving variables, be it Hassan Whiteside proving himself all over again or Chris Bosh's return from his health scare. Much of their success, however, hinges on Wade's ability to be the all encompassing weapon he's made a Hall of Fame career out of. Last season, his averages of 24.3 points, 5.5 assists and 4.0 rebounds per 36 minutes were his best since 2010-11, proving he's still capable of wreaking havoc.\nGiven the state of his knees, there's no doubting the end is near for Wade. One more season of him playing at an All-Star level, though, may just turn the Heat into one of the scariest teams in the East.\n8. How much will the Hawks miss DeMarre Carroll? © Provided by Sporting News In theory, the Hawks shouldn't miss DeMarre Carroll too much. Their four All-Stars returned for another hurrah and the trio of Thabo Sefolosha, Justin Holiday and Tim Hardaway Jr. should replace the bare minimum of Carroll's production. Acquiring Tiago Splitter in the offseason addresses their biggest need, too, after they were bludgeoned to death on the boards during the playoffs.\nIn reality, though, the Hawks will miss Carroll tremendously.\nThere's a reason 3-and-D wings like Carroll scored big bucks this offseason. While a player like Sefolosha is capable of holding his own against LeBron James defensively, he's a huge liability on offense. Hardaway Jr. and Holiday could join forces to fill the void, but they're unproven players on a veteran squad in need of reliable shooting and tenacious defense. Odds are, they won't.\nThe Hawks have enough pieces to be a powerhouse in the East, but their title window may have closed when Carroll inked a four-year deal with the Raptors.\n9. Is Kevin Love ready to be Kevin Love again? © Provided by Sporting News Even though Love had a down season individually, there's no doubting the impact he had one his new teammates. The Cavaliers saw their offensive rating jump by 4.8 points when Love was on the floor and LeBron James made the most of his ability to stretch the defense by increasing his efficiency across the board.\nWith the Cavaliers planning on featuring Love in a bigger role this season, that should be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to unlocking their full-blown potential. After averaging 26.1 points and 12.5 rebounds in his final season with the Timberwolves, we know Love is fit for the task, and being more than the third wheel he was in 2014-15 will help James stay young and keep Kyrie Irving off the sidelines .\nIf Love picks up where he left off before Kelly Olynyk separated his shoulder, you might as well pencil the Cavaliers in for a return to the finals.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2015-09-24/pacers-paul-george-not-pleased-about-move-to-power-forward-nba-basketball", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2015-10-12/bradley-beal-long-2s-breakout-season-wizards-harden-thompson", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2015-10-06/kyrie-irving-knee-injury-prevention-playoffs-cavaliers", "http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=12794289", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656868-nba-contenders-of-the-east-conference-cavs-lebron-bulls-heat-hawks", "http://hardwoodparoxysm.com/2015/05/01/kyle-lowry-the-little-engine-that-couldnt/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2015-09-22/paul-george-indiana-pacers-power-forward-position-stats-outlook-season", "http://nyloncalculus.com/2015/10/14/projecting-jimmy-butlers-regression/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658147-2015-16-nba-predictions-finals-champion-lebron-james-cavaliers", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/10/6/9462321/carmelo-anthony-denies-trade-rumors-knicks"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:31:31.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
