He keeps shrugging his shoulders and going all Tony Robbins on us.\n“I think the biggest part of it is the mental aspect,” Estrada said before Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. It’s both true and means absolutely nothing.\nFor seven years in the major leagues, Estrada was just good enough to keep playing at this level. For a few months this summer, he’s been Greg Maddux.\nHistory suggests that this sort of pitcher eventually turns back into a pumpkin. The Blue Jays just can’t afford that Estrada do it now. And so, he’s started.\nDuring Friday night’s opener of the ALCS, we got flashes of bad, old Estrada.\nHe was jittery. Kansas City hitters were not.\nFrom the outset, you could say this for Game 1 – it knew its place.\nWednesday’s palpitating elimination encounter has temporarily skewed Toronto’s “sports excitement” bar. The sort of game you used to think was a 10 is now a 7. A 5 is, like, maybe a 3.\nA Toronto sports “7” used to be a good expenditure of your time. Now, it’s probably a better idea to watch a rerun of Storage Wars . Somebody might flip something.\nAt least initially, Game 1 was perhaps a 6-out-of-10.\nThere was great enthusiasm from the crowd at Kauffman Stadium, but you weren’t actively afraid of them. That’s minus one point.\nThe umpires were making calls that seemed to adhere to both the rulebook and the spirit of the game. Admirable, but enervating. Minus a point.\nSince the Kansas City park is located on a spread the size of San Simeon, balls that would go out at other fields flag at the warning track here. Josh Donaldson hit one an awful long way in the Jays’ second plate appearance of the game. It looked like a home run off the bat. It landed 400 feet away, but hadn’t left the yard. Unfair. Minus one point.\nThe last take-back was down to Estrada.\nHis first pitch of the game was ripped for a double. In the third inning, he gave up two more. Estrada wasn’t terrible, but unlike his Kansas City counterpart, Edinson Volquez, he couldn’t knuckle down when he needed to. Instead, he allowed the Royals to knick him up.\nIn the fourth, Salvador Perez – one of those guys you’ve only half-heard of, but who makes the Royals tick – drove a ball over the left-field wall. A couple of base runners into the sixth, Estrada was pulled.\nSurrendering three runs in 5 1/3 innings isn’t a total failure. But given where the Jays’ pitching suddenly finds itself, Estrada can only afford to be average when the Jays’ lineup is considerably more than that.\nPlayoff weeble-wobble David Price follows Estrada for Saturday’s Game 2. On that score, nobody’s worried. Except when you ask them about it.\nA question that would have been laughed at a month ago – “Is Price all right?” – has become the sort that now elicits sober nodding.\n“I don’t worry about him at all,” manager John Gibbons said before Friday’s series opener. Then he explained why he’s worried about him.\n“I know he’s had his struggles in the postseason, but to accomplish what he does every year, you’re good. You’re really good. I think what happens to those guys – your workhorses – you get to the end of the year, they’re gassed. They throw a lot of innings … and so that takes its toll on them.”\nPrice-as-worn-out rather than Price-as-mentally-shot – that makes more sense. It shouldn’t make you feel any better, but it makes more sense.\nYou can’t ask Price to give it a little more because it’s the postseason. A throwing arm is a precision instrument. Trying to make up in effort what you’re lacking in stuff is a little like asking a surgeon to do better heart transplants by pressing down harder on the scalpel.\nPrice has either had one of those little dips even the best pitchers have, or he’s just trying to hold it together. We’ll see on Saturday.\nThis morning, people will be having a (needless) worry about the offence, but it’s the pitching that should concern them.\nIf Price has blown his bolt and if Estrada is reverting to the mean, that leaves Marcus Stroman and R.A. Dickey to bamboozle one of baseball’s trickiest lineups. It’s possible, but it’s difficult.\nThere are other concerns in the bullpen, and especially if it starts having to do more than a couple of innings of work in an evening.\nAaron Loup, who missed two games while on personal leave, remains the only left-handed arm on the team aside from Price. Over a total of an inning’s work against Texas, he was solid. That doesn’t mean the Jays trust him. He’s getting chances because there is no other choice.\nThat hole in the Jays bullpen wasn’t exposed against the Rangers because their best left-handed bats all slumped at once. I suppose it could happen twice, but I wouldn’t bet it.\nBased on Gibbons’s choices when things got tight against Texas, he doesn’t trust anyone outside the live, young arms of Aaron Sanchez and Roberto Osuna. That pair pitched 11 innings in relief against Texas. The rest of the current bullpen pitched three.\nCan the Jays manage it with this group? Sure. But as the postseason stretches on, the thinness of their pitching will only become moreso. In this regard, weakness begets more weakness.\nThe solution isn’t entirely dependent on the offence. It’s down to a few key performers – such as Estrada – doing more than the Jays can reasonably expect from them.\nFollow Cathal Kelly on Twitter: @cathalkelly\nMore Related to this Story Kelly: With Jays’ season on the line, time to go for broke and open dome\nKelly: The Blue Jays have finally broken Toronto’s sports curse\nBlue Jays advance to American League Championship Series\nTopics: Kansas City Royals American League Marco Estrada Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City, Kansas Comments Print /\nLicense A A", "external_links": ["http://license.icopyright.net/3.8425?icx_id=26861498", "http://license.icopyright.net/g2/3.8425?icx_id=26861498", "https://twitter.com/@cathalkelly", "http://embed.sendtonews.com/player2/embedcode.php?fk=Nq7D0Exu&cid=5240"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:51:29.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
