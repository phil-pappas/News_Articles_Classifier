Schurr runs for 2 scores, throws late touchdown pass to lead Army past Bucknell, 21-14 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  56   3:56   \nPeople: \nFootball (1913) \n\nWEST POINT, New York — A.J. Schurr came off the bench to run for two touchdowns and threw for the winning score to help Army beat Bucknell 21-14 on Saturday. \nSchurr connected with Edgar Poe, who won a jump ball over Nick O'Brien and ran all the way to the end zone for a 68-yard score, to put Army up with 4:44 left. Chris Carnegie intercepted R.J. Nitti on Bucknell's ensuing drive to clinch it. \nFollowing a 44-3 rout by Duke last week, Army (2-5) won at home for the first time this season despite trailing at halftime 14-7. The Black Knights came back from a halftime deficit for the first time under second-year coach Jeff Monken, improving to 1-9 when down at the break. \nNitti finished 17 for 33 for 186 yards and Matt DelMauro added 105 on the ground for the Bison (3-3). \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:01:34.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
