Coach: Jim Larranaga. \nConference: Atlantic Coast. \nKey returners: G Sheldon McClellan, led Hurricanes with 14.5 ppg and 54 3-pointers last year; G Angel Rodriguez, averaged 11.9 ppg and team-high 3.9 a; C Tonye Jekiri, led Hurricanes with 9.9 rpg and averaged 8.6 ppg. \nWho left: G Manu Lecomte, who averaged 7.9 ppg and was part of a crowded backcourt before transferring to Baylor. \nThe Skinny: The Hurricanes return 73 percent of their scoring from a year ago, when they played in April for the first time. Kamari Murphy, a 6-8 transfer from Oklahoma State, adds size and defense, and this should be Miami’s best season since the 2013 ACC championship team - and maybe better. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:34.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
