John Hickenlooper visited Fort Lyon to celebrate its second birthday and meet with residents.\nThe remote, sprawling complex, which occupies 552 acres about 200 miles southeast of Denver, has always been considered a pilot program by the state.\nThis year's overall budget of $4.93 million, which is split between Bent County (which operates the facility) and the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless (which staffs it), included $2.5 million for the Coalition — down from $2.9 million last year.\nWhy the $400,000 difference from the coalition's year-to-year budget was a surprise to the staff at Fort Lyon remains unclear.\nParvensky said it was due to an \"error\" and \"miscommunication\" from the Department of Local Affairs, which funds Fort Lyon. But Denise Stepto, communications director for the Department of Local Affairs, said no error was made and this year's budget should have been no surprise.\nFort Lyon is now far more efficient than when the facility was a prison or VA hospital, said Bent County Commissioner Bill Long, who has been involved in the transition at Fort Lyon.\n\"We've been able to substantially reduce utility costs by $300,000 since the state last operated the campus,\" Long said. \"I hate putting a cost to what I would view as saving people's lives, but the reality is that will be measured by the legislature and the Joint Budget Committee. If it was costing $100,000 per resident out there, it would be shut down. Hopefully we can provide the same end results with fewer staff.\"\nThe cost of caring for a homeless person in Colorado averages about $40,000 per year, but the per-resident cost at Fort Lyon is half that, according to the coalition. More than 500 residents have been served in two years at Fort Lyon.\nLane Brundage, the vocational specialist of activities, watches Philip Coppernoll play piano at the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless' residential community. The facility boasts a 38 percent turnover rate — which tracks the number of residents admitted versus the number who leave or are dismissed — besting the national average of 50 percent.\n\"We're under this tremendous pressure to get the numbers up and keep the cost down,\" Fort Lyon's on-site director James Ginsburg told The Denver Post in July .\nGinsburg did not address the recent layoffs last week and referred questions to the coalition's media contact.\nLaid-off workers, who requested anonymity due to the fact that they are still employed through the end of the month, expressed alarm at the new ratio of residents to case managers, which is 20 to 1.\nFort Lyon resident Baugher said she posted a public petition last week, which other residents have signed, that lobbies administrators to retain the current staff.\n\"It feels like I'm a foster kid being pushed into another foster home,\" she said.\nJohn Wenzel: 303-954-1642, jwenzel@denverpost.com or @johnwenzel", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1011/20151011__20151012_A2_CD10FORTLYON~p2_300.jpg", "http://www.coloradocoalition.org/", "http://www.coloradocoalition.org/who_we_are/parvensky_bio.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:24:46.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
