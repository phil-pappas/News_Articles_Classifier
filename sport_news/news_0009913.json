Jim Zorn didn’t come in with intent to say ‘I want Christians.’ But he sold his pitch. His sales pitch was, ‘Believe in and have faith in my program.’”\nIn the interview, Portis also called Zorn “phony” in the way he conducted himself.\n“If I don’t get in no trouble, don’t assume the way that I live my life. Don’t preach to me about what’s right,” Portis said . “Because you’re not right, you’re phony. You’re sitting here in my face telling me one thing, and then you go behind my back and say something else.”\nZorn was 12–20 in two seasons with the Redskins and failed to make the playoffs both years. He was fired by the team following the final game of the 2009 season.\n• Waiver Wire: Count on these players to be 2nd-half stars\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/", "http://www.si.com/fantasy/2015/10/19/week-7-waiver-wire-eddie-lacy-struggles-christine-michael-james-starks", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2015/10/20/clinton-portis-suggests-jim-zorn-divided-the-locker-room-between-christians-and-ballplayers/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:34:37.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
