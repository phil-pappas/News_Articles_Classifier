They said CONMEBOL agreed the following year to a $112.5 million deal for the 2016 Copa America Centenario. \nAfter an indictment was unsealed against 14 soccer executives and marketing officials, prosecutors said as part of its deals Datisa agreed to pay $110 million in bribes to South American soccer officials. \nCONMEBOL said Wednesday its commercial rights contract related to Copa America Centenario has been terminated. \nCONCACAF said it ended its relationship with Datisa \"in connection\" with the Copa America Centennario rights agreement signed on March 4 last year. CONCACAF said it had been reassigned those rights. \nIn a statement not attributed to anyone in CONCACAF by name, CONCACAF said it will select new partners to sell the commercial rights along with CONMEBOL and local operating partners, which CONCACAF did not identify. \nCONCACAF also said the new partners will be selected in a \"new and transparent process.\" It did not announce any details of the process. \nCONCACAF spokesman Jurgen Mainka did not return a telephone call seeking comment. \nThink your friends should see this?
