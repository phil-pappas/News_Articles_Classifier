Van Gaal deployed Rooney as a lone forward and shifted the in-form Anthony Martial onto the left despite the Frenchman’s impressive goal scoring form, Sky Sports reported on Sunday.\nRooney, who turned 30 on Saturday, failed to manage a single shot on target against City, and his only attempt in the enire game was blocked in a rather anonymous performance, with United’s best chances falling to Jesse Lingard and Chris Smalling late on. Van Gaal, however, was in no mood to discuss Rooney’s form following the draw and insists he will no longer answer questions on the topic. “I have to talk every week about Rooney, why? You have your opinion — write it. I don’t give any more answers about Wayne Rooney. I am sick of them,” van Gaal said.\nThe Dutchman revealed that he urged his United side at half-time to try their luck from distance as they went in search of victory over a City side missing their two star players in Sergio Aguero and David Silva. “We know we didn’t create so many chances because it is difficult how they have played, so organised, so on the counter-attack,” van Gaal said. “That is like the game against Moscow, the same, also organised but it says something about the strength of Manchester United these days,” the United manager added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:36:42.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
