It's almost like taking a grave stone,\" said Pastor Ken Ross.\nIt is impossible for a thief or thieves not to know what the bench stood for.\nA loving message is sprawled on the seat from heart-broken parents to their stillborn baby girl: Alexandra Ramona Kimball.\nThey placed a donated bench under this tree in 2008 in their place of solace: Arbor Heights Community Church on 41st Avenue Southwest.\nPastor Ken Ross guesses it was stolen last week, possibly Wednesday or Thursday.\nNothing else was taken or vandalized at Ark Park.\nA-R-K for Alexandra's initials.\n\"For some reason somebody got it in their craw to take something that's pretty precious to the family and to the church and to the community for that matter,\" said Ross.\nHe said crime like car break-ins in the neighborhood has increased recently, but nothing like this.\nThe three-piece bench reads:\nIn Memory of Our Baby\nAlexandra Ramona Kimball\nAlways Loved\n03 - 28 - 08\nThe pastor’s message to the thieves: “Well I think to do the right thing,” he said. \"Maybe to search the core of their heart and say: ok, what would be the right thing to do?\"\nThe bench weighs about 200 pounds.", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:13:57.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
