KEVIN SULLIVAN, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » ARLINGTON, Texas – Sunday was a strange day for David Freese on two levels.\nFirst, he’s not used to missing the playoffs. It was the first time since 2010 that Freese, who used to play for the St. Louis Cardinals, had seen his season end after 162 games.\nSecond, he’s now going into the unknown that is free agency.\nThe most prominent of the Angels potential free agents, Freese said he would “absolutely” like to be back.\n“With that said, a lot of things have to happen on both sides,” Freese said. “It’s a new experience for me. We’ll see what happens when the World Series is over, and go from there.”\nFreese hit .257 with 14 homers and 56 RBI this season, including .308 after he came off the disabled list on Sept. 1. Freese was one of the keys to Angels resurgence, as they began winning once he returned to plug one of the holes in the lineup.\nThe Angels have no apparent replacement for him. Both Kaleb Cowart and Kyle Kubitza have shown flashes of being able to be an everyday third baseman in the majors.\n�\nALSO\n�\nAlbert Pujols hit his 40 th homer, joining Mike Trout as the first Angels teammates to reach that milestone. Previously, Troy Glaus was the only Angels player to hit 40 homers, doing so twice…\nIn Trout’s final at-bat of the season, his average dropped below .300. He finished the season hitting .299 with 41 homers and 90 RBIs. He had a .402 on-base percentage and a .590 slugging percentage.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq5a4-freese.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq5a4-freese.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:16:13.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
