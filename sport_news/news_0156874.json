Here are a couple roster notes before the game starts.\n1. Devin Chafin out. Based on Art Briles' comments this week, it should not come as a shock, but junior RB Devin Chafin is out against Rice this week with a hamstring injury. Chafin has dealt with numerous injury issues in the past, including hamstring problems. Whether or not the issue is especially serious, it likely is a good decision to let him heal before he is needed in conference play.\n2. Chance Waz is your new starter at safety. Two-year starter Terrell Burt has held a stranglehold on the free safety position in both Big 12 title seasons. However, after numerous questions about his tackling and cover ability, Burt was replaced by true sophomore Chance Waz against Lamar. After an open competition this week, Waz emerged victorious and is the new starter at safety next to Orion Stewart. It will be interesting to see whether that trend continues into conference play.\n3. LaQuan McGowan starting. With usual starting TE Tre'Von Armstead off the team for a rules violation, the position just got a little bit bigger. Now, 400-pound tight end LaQuan McGowan is listed as the starter, which should delight fans. Even though McGowan is nominally the starter, there is little chance he plays the most snaps. Expect senior Gus Penning to get plenty of snaps. Sophomore Jordan Feuerbacher could also play, even though he announced he wanted to redshirt earlier this season.\n*Note: The initial Baylor depth chart incorrectly noted Terrell Burt as the starter at safety.\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-09-26T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:34:14.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
