They were dubbed \"The Joplin Nine.\" But now the nine have become “The Joplin Fifteen.”\nSix new pitbulls and now mastiff mixes were dropped off by animal control at the shelter from the same owner. Many of the dogs are underweight and malnourished. Shelter Manager Lysa Boston says they're anywhere from eight months to five years old and in need of some TLC.\n\"Animals are expensive to keep and maintain. You have to be prepared for medical problems. These guys are thin. You know it's going to take a while to get them where they need to be and they just need somebody that's going to commit to them for the next 10-15 years. That's a pretty long term commitment in the world today,” says Boston.\nThe shelter welcomes any financial donations toward their care and medical treatment. Boston also says dog food can go a long way. If you'd like to help, you can mail in a check or do so on their website.", "external_links": ["http://www.joplinhumane.org/donate.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:37:37.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
