The sophomore quarterback was medically disqualified from playing football due to multiple concussions. (Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com) Comments \nSyracuse University's football program did the right thing last week when it medically disqualified sophomore quarterback AJ Long after a series of concussions going back to his high school years. The decision shows the university is taking the risk of concussions seriously, and that its regard for athletes goes deeper than their abilities on the playing field. Other college programs should follow SU's lead. \nThat isn't always the case. Just this past August, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign fired head football coach Tim Beckman after an investigation showed he pressured his athletes to play hurt and discouraged them from reporting injuries. It's a dangerous path, considering the damage we now know athletes – especially football players -- can suffer from repeated blows to the head. The cognitive and emotional effects can surface long after athletes' playing days are over. \nBecause of the heightened scrutiny of head injuries, players themselves may be reluctant to report concussions. Long admitted as much to staff writer Stephen Bailey: \"I couldn't even tell you how many (concussions) I possibly had in the last three or four years. And I didn't want to bring them forward because I knew my time would be done.\" \nLong is the fourth Orange player in the past two years to be medically disqualified over head injuries under NCAA and university rules designed to protect athletes. \nLong's first concussion came in high school. His second came last summer, when he fell out of bed and hit his head on a nightstand. The third -- the one that triggered a mandatory review by team physician Dr. James Tucker – happened earlier this month at practice, during a drill that was not supposed to involve hitting the quarterback. That was bad luck. But Long's luck was sure to run out eventually. \nThat Long's football career is over barely after it began is a blow for a team running low on healthy quarterbacks, and for him personally. The former quarterback is handling it with amazing grace . \nLong intends to stay at Syracuse to finish his degree. He hopes to return to football someday as a coach and recruiter. Later, he wants to start a high school and mentor kids to football greatness. \n\"We all understand how short this game is,\" Long said. \"We understand we have a short period of time to play it and we want to as long as possible, regardless of our health. And I was one of those guys.'' \nSyracuse's football team was lucky to have him for a brief time. The university community is lucky to keep him for a couple more years. When he graduates, he'll be an alumnus for life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:57:20.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
