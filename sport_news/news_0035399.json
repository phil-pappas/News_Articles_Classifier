Davis’ catch went for a 53-yard score and his first touchdown catch of the year. \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nThe Mt. Pleasant football team hosted Fairfield in the 2015 homecoming game on Friday night. The Panthers got a season-high 306 passing yards and four scores through the air, but the Trojans were able to escape, 43-33 behind 200 yards rushing and four touchdowns from running back Fejon Redd. \nThe game did not start out ideal for the Panthers. On the first play from scrimmage, a Joe Hess pass was picked off by Fairfield linebacker Brandon Smithburg and ran back for a touchdown to open the scoring. A bobbled extra point turned into a throw to the end zone that was picked off by Tanner Ruby and the Trojans were up 6-0 early. \nDShundric Foster set Mt. Pleasant up for the counter-punch on the next drive. The junior returned the kick past the Trojan coverage team and flew all the way to the Fairfield 22-yard line before he was finally brought down. That set up an 18-yard strike from Hess to Pat Canby for a touchdown that made it 7-0. \nThe scoring continued on Fairfield’s next drive. Fejon Redd took a sweep to the left and sprinted down the sideline for a 62-yard touchdown run. But the Panthers punched back again with another long touchdown pass, this time to Jack Davis who caught a 53-yard touchdown pass down the near sideline. The score was 14-13 in the first three minutes of the ballgame. \n“I remember looking up at the clock and just realizing it was still in the first quarter,” said Mt. Pleasant head coach Shawn Striegel. “There were some bad errors for both teams and both us and Fairfield took advantage.” \nThe scoring slowed for the rest of the first half, but the Trojans were able to score twice more before the break. Cameron Baumann found Jake Unkrich on a 50-yard touchdown pass with 2:24 left in the first quarter and Redd had a short touchdown run with 7:14 left in the half that made it 26-14 Trojans at the break. \nMt. Pleasant came out firing again in the second half. Hess found Canby, who snuck behind the defense, for a 56-yard touchdown pass that cut the lead to 26-21. Fairfield kicker Soloman Constant hit a 26-yard field goal late in the third quarter to push the lead to 29-21, but Mt. Pleasant had the ball with a shot to tie it up. \nMt. Pleasant had two possessions reach the red zone in the fourth quarter. The first was ended when the Fairfield defense forced a fumble with 9:30 left in the game. \nAfter getting the ball back however, Mt. Pleasant marched inside the 10-yard line and Canby scampered to the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown run on fourth and one. The two-point pass fell incomplete, however, and Fairfield led 29-27 with just under four minutes to go in the game. \nThe Trojans kept the ball out of Mt. Pleasant’s hands with a steady diet of outside runs by Redd. The senior running back lead the Trojans to a long drive which ended with his third touchdown run of the game. The extra point pushed the lead to 36-27. \nUnkrich picked off a pass on the ensuing drive which led to another touchdown run by Redd. The Panthers were able to put a final touchdown on the board with a 41-yard pass from Hess to Foster, but when the dust settled, the Trojans walked away with a 10-point win. \n“I thought our kids played well,” said Fairfield coach Mike Schenck about the win. “I thought that Redd ran extremely hard and made a lot of people miss tackles. I thought Baumann threw the ball well and our receivers were solid catching the ball.” \nSchenck also praised the play of Mt. Pleasant, saying he was very impressed with the Panther passing game. \n“We only had one blown coverage all night and (Hess) still put up big numbers on us, and the Mt. Pleasant receivers caught the ball. We felt fortunate to get out of town with a win.” \nFor the Trojans, Redd’s 200 yards on the ground and four scores led the team. He also caught one pass for 26 yards. Baumann finished 12-21 with one touchdown pass and one interception. \nThree seniors, Unkrich, Alex Crile and Jordan Reid led the Trojans in receiving. Crile caught four passes for 67 yards, Unkrich had three catches for 60 yards and a touchdown and Reid caught three balls for 57 yards. \nRedd, Reid and Jose Rojo each had 5.5 tackles to lead the defense. Zach Martin and Crile had five apiece. The Trojans forced five turnovers. Unkrich had two picks, Smithburg had a pick-six and Michael Fritz and Zach Martin each had fumble recoveries. \nHess finished 20-40 for 306 yards and four touchdowns for Mt. Pleasant. Canby had a 136 yards receiving, 65 yards rushing and two total touchdowns. \nFoster and Davis finished with 83 and 53 yards receiving respectively with a score apiece and Kieran Kohorst caught three balls for 23 yards. Foster had one interception on defense and was a star on special teams. He had 176 total return yards on the day. \n“Our kids were fighting on both sides of the ball and being competitive,” said Striegel about the game. “What it really comes down to is execution. We just want to keep that momentum going forward. Obviously we want to get a win and we’re gonna fight for that.” \nThe Trojans moved to 4-3 on the year and 3-1 in the district. They’ll play in their final home game on Friday night against Davenport Assumption. Mt. Pleasant falls to 0-7 overall and 0-4 in the district. The Panthers will travel to Washington this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:21:34.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
