Although Barnes and Govan are in the process of getting a divorce, the New York Post 's Ian Mohr reported Wednesday that Barnes was livid when he found out Fisher was with his estranged spouse at his prior Los Angeles home. This led to a confrontation on Saturday that a source described to the Post : Derek was in Gloria's back yard with about 10 people having a bonfire on ​​Saturday. Derek's separated from his wife and there's a relationship with [Gloria]. [...] Barnes was in Santa Barbara [at Memphis Grizzlies training camp] and heard that Fisher was in his house. He went crazy. He got in his car and went to the house and went after Fisher. Another source indicated Fisher and Govan have been together for a \"few months.\" Someone close to Fisher told Mohr that Barnes' alleged attack resulted in Fisher suffering a few scratches but charges wouldn't be pressed. Yahoo Sports' Shams Charania and Adrian Wojnarowski reported Fisher is in fact considering legal action but has yet to file charges. Fisher, now a head coach, missed Monday's New York Knicks practice for personal reasons and had flown to L.A. in the first place on a day off, while Barnes was in Santa Barbara finishing Memphis Grizzlies training camp. Barnes reportedly drove 95 miles to Los Angeles in order to face Fisher. The two men were Lakers teammates for two seasons from 2010 through 2012. Bleacher Report's Sean Highkin passed along a statement from the Grizzlies on Barnes, which read, \"We are aware and currently gathering information regarding today's report involving Matt Barnes. We have no further comment at this time.\" Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News didn't seem to notice anything out of the ordinary when he recently saw Fisher that would suggest a scuffle. According to Yahoo, Grizzlies and Knicks security are expected to begin jointly investigating Saturday's incident. Beyond the potential litigation that could follow, the next turn in this purported saga may occur when Barnes and Fisher face each other on the court in 2015-16. The Knicks travel to FedExForum to take on the Grizzlies on Saturday, Jan. 16. Barnes' squad will then hit the road for Madison Square Garden for another matchup between the two teams on Friday, Feb. 5.
