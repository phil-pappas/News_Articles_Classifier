I'm not sure the Central will be used to this college-type atmosphere. \n\"Between points, you're going to hear a lot of cheering and a lot of people saying 'go' and 'get after it' and 'that's a great play' -- all kinds of cheering. I'm not sure if it will bode well with the Central people, but any time Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville and Har-Ber get after each other around here, it's a college atmosphere.\" \nRogers High, Fayetteville and Bentonville are expected to continue their battle for boys supremacy like they did during the 7A-West Conference championships earlier this month. Rogers and Fayetteville wound up sharing the league title with 11 points, while Bentonville -- the five-time defending state champion -- was on their heels with 10 points. \nThe 7A-Central schools could have something to say about that matter. Brayden Montgomery of Van Buren and Parker Stearns of Little Rock Catholic are highly regarded players and could take points away from the area schools, while Nersesian believes the boys doubles division is a wide-open race for anybody to take. \n\"Rogers, Fayetteville and us have plenty of personnel on all sides of those brackets to battle with the Central,\" Nersesian said. \"In the Central, you have Catholic, Little Rock Central and Van Buren that can change the dynamics of the tournament. I think it's a more balanced bracket than ever before.\" \nNersesian likes Bentonville's chances of repeating at state champion in the girls division. The Lady Tigers, who dominated the 7A-West Conference tournament, have the maximum six entries, with Adriana Canigova and Kruti Shah in singles play and the duos of Bessie Sullivan and Taylor Cheung-Damonte and Avery Hargrove and Emily Gean in doubles competition. \nMount St. Mary will provide the Lady Tigers' stiffest challenge as the Belles also have the maximum six entries. \n\"We have the best possible position we could be with everybody in,\" Nersesian said. \"Rogers was right there behind us, and Mount St. Mary is probably the strongest teams out of the Central. \n\"They have some freshmen that are going to step up and have some top seeds. It's going to be interesting to see if those freshmen can bring it, and they normally do because they play in Southern tournaments and preparing for tournaments like this.\" \nThe tournament begins at 10 a.m. both days. First-round and quarterfinal matches will be held today, while the semifinals and championships are slated for Tuesday. \nHenry Apple can be reached at happle@nwadg.com or on Twitter @NWAHenry. \nSports on 10/19/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:09:38.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
