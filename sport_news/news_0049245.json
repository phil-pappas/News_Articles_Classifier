Last season the Titans lost to Bufurd on senior night and did not earn a rematch. \n“I was really frustrated we didn’t get a chance to play them again,” Bennum said. “I just wanted another chance because I felt like we could have done so much better. This year we ended up beating North Hall in the area tournament.” \nWith one avenged game down, the Titans needed to win against Bufurd to secure the area championship title. The game was one Bennum beamed about at practice the day before because the team did not make it to this stage in 2014. \n“Honestly this has been our goal, to get to the area championship and to play Bufurd again,” Bennum said. “This could be a state championship game. They could be in the state championship, and we are good enough to possibly get there.” \nLast season was Bennum’s second as head coach. The team has made strides towards an area championship and well as a state championship, something it did not experience in recent years prior to Bennum. The main aspect of the team that has changed is its belief in itself and its competitive nature. \nOne way Bennum sets the competitive tone is by keeping a points system. The players get points from different drills they run in practice. Small group drills go in the cauldron by one. Points from position tournaments in practice are multiplied by two. The points from the six-on-six drills are multiplied by three. Because six-on-six is how the players compete in real games, they are worth more. At the end of each practice, Bennum records each player’s points on a big white board. \n“When Stacey became our coach, it became a different philosophy,” senior Madison Thomas said. “We learned new things and our practices become more tough and we started competing. Everybody really wante” \nB \nennum uses the cauldron system to help her decide who gets to start. Everything she uses to coach her team has a philosophical meaning behind it. The philosophy starts with the team’s mindset which is a portion of the team she wanted to change when she first arrived from the state of Washington. The team dons shirts with “Mindful Volleyball” scripted across the chest at practice. It’s a reminder of the philosophy Bennum has instated. \n“Always being competitive and mentally focused,” senior Lizzy Aldrich said. “You could be playing the best team in the state, you could be playing the worst team, but you always have to compete.” \nIt is called the gold medal squared. A philosophy designed by U.S. Olympic team coaches who won multiple gold medals. It started at Brigham Young University, Bennum’s alma mater. Whatever can put her team in a position to win, Bennum is always ready to try. \nThe Washington native was a volleyball player in college and coached at various high schools before relocating with her husband across the country. They got married while she was at BYU, which was followed by a pregnancy. Her husband wanted to coach high school football, and she wanted to stay home with her kids. \nAfter much research, the couple found that coaches in the South are paid more. It came down to Florida, Texas and Georgia, and Georgia was the perfect situation. Her husband coached football for five years but is now the head basketball coach at Elbert County. Georgia has become the perfect home for Bennum and her family. \nNow she has extended members of her family — her team. \nThe Titans have gone to the Elite Eight of the state championship twice. The team has come a long way since Madison Thomas and Leslie Aldrich were freshmen. \n“Our freshman year we lost everything,” Thomas said. “And we didn’t even make it past the first round of state. Our sophomore year we won region and went to the third round of the state tournament, so it completely flipped.” \nThe team went into Thursday’s area championship game hoping to flip its luck against Bufurd. When the Titans played the Wolves in September, they lost 25-23, 25-19 (best of three). On Thursday night, Bennum’s team lost to Bufurd in the area championship 25-20, 25-12-, 25-14 (best of five). \nThe team is still eligible for state and should host at least one round in the region section. \n“We’ve gotten better each year,” Thomas said. “So this year we are hoping to go further than the third round.” \nAldrich said that she and Thomas were a part of the largest freshman class to join the volleyball team with upwards of 10 girls. Now they are the only two remaining from that class. They are reaping the benefits of being committed to the sport and of having Bennum step in as head coach. \n“It’s been amazing,” Aldrich said. “Just to see what the program has been from almost nothing to the most competitive practices. (Bennum is) an amazing coach who would do anything for us.” \nThe first thing Bennum did as head coach was instill belief in her girls. Despite losing the area championship, she and her team are confident in their chances of advancing pass the third round of this year’s state championship tournament. \n“Personally, I think it’s a belief thing in their heart,” Bennum said. “They felt lucky to get there. When I got here, they didn’t feel like they were as good as they are. If they can go [into the state tournament] believing they can do it, then they can.” \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
