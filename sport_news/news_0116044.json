File photo: Zaheer Abbas (left) with ICC chairman N Srinivasan \nReacting on the issue, Abbas, who is also a former Pakistan cricketer, said: \"It's not a new thing. It's been happening for long. But being the ICC president, I want cricket to spread all around the world.\" \n\"Politics and cricket are two different things. Pakistan is not asking India to play in Pakistan. Pakistan is asking for a bilateral series to be played at a neutral venue,\" he told TV channels here. \nThe ICC president said the entire cricketing world is waiting for an Indo-Pak series to take place. \"Nothing better than India and Pakistan playing each other. The whole world and the people of both India and Pakistan are waiting for the series. The world is hoping that India will give a good news to the cricketing world,\" said Abbas, who is regarded as one of the finest batsmen of Pakistan. \nManohar had invited Khan for talks on the much-awaited series scheduled in December. But the Sena workers today barged into the BCCI office holding anti-Pakistan placards and shouted slogans against Shahryar, who is in Mumbai to meet the newly-elected BCCI president. \nThe protesters gheraoed BCCI chief Manohar's desk and said they will not allow any cricket ties with Pakistan. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:57:18.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
