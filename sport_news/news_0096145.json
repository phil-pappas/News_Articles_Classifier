(Photo: Tom Pennington, Getty Images) \nCONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Allen Park — Cliff Avril was among the best picks former general manager Matt Millen made with the Lions, but as is often the case with this franchise, Avril’s greatest success came after he left Detroit.\nSince joining Seattle in 2013, Avril has played in two Super Bowls, winning one, and become one of the star pass rushers for one of the NFL’s most-vaunted defenses.\n“He’s been a legitimate rock on the left side now,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said in a teleconference Thursday. “He plays our ‘Leo’ position and as a pass rusher, he’s been a terrific player for us.\n“All of the good things that we’ve been able to do since he’s arrived, he’s been right in the middle of it and a big part, so we love what Cliff has contributed.”\nThe Lions (0-3) play the Seahawks (1-2) in Seattle on Monday night, and Avril already has eight tackles and one sack.\nEven though he developed into a top defensive end during his five seasons with the Lions, with 39½ sacks and 16 forced fumbles, the Lions chose not to re-sign him in 2013 after using the franchise tag on him in 2012.\nDETROIT NEWS\nNiyo: Lack of development shows when pressure's on\nAlthough it seemed like he could’ve made more money, Avril signed a two-year deal worth up to $15 million with Seattle in March 2013. He had eight sacks and five forced fumbles his first season with the Seahawks despite starting in just two games. During his second season, when he had five sacks and one forced fumble, Seattle re-signed him to a four-year, $28.5 million deal.\n“He creates some problems for you,” Lions coach Jim Caldwell said of Avril. “He’s fast, very athletic and disruptive. He’s a pretty unique athlete.”\nDuring Seattle’s Super Bowl run in 2013, Avril had 1½ sacks, two forced fumbles and three passes defensed in the postseason. Last year, Avril had two more sacks in the playoffs as the Seahawks lost in the Super Bowl, and Carroll called him a “terrific pro.”\n“He’s a really good player,” Carroll said. “He’s really smart, he’s a good pro, he handles his business and takes care of everything really well. He’s a good leader in that regard. He practices hard every day, he’s got a good demeanor about him, his mentality is upbeat and positive and supportive of the young guys.”\nLions safety Don Carey is one of the few remaining defensive players who was here with Avril, though it was just 2011-12. From what he saw of Avril, Carey thinks his former teammate deserves the success he’s had in Seattle.\n“I wish we still had him,” Carey said. “I love Cliff. He’s a great guy, a great athlete. He’s done well for himself there.”\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:00:43.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
