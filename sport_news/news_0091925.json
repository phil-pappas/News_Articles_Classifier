Blatter was suspended as part of the same investigation.\nInfantino, who was already viewed as a contender to be appointed FIFA secretary general, gives UEFA another option if FIFA's election committee bars Platini as a candidate. His candidacy also could strengthen a Europe-Asia alliance that seemed decisive earlier in the campaign.\nUEFA said in a statement that the Swiss lawyer \"has our full support in his campaign to become FIFA president.\"\n\"He is in the process of submitting the required nominations and will issue a statement ?on his candidacy later today,\" the European soccer body said.\nOther probable candidates vying for the FIFA job include Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, South African tycoon Tokyo Sexwale, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne and David Nakhid, a former player from Trinidad and Tobago.\nSheikh Salman's entry was already being criticized by rights groups who urged FIFA's election committee to reject him as a candidate when it conducts integrity checks.\nQuestions have been raised over whether Sheikh Salman adequately protected Bahrain national team players after some took part in pro-democracy protests in 2011. Some players say they were tortured while detained by government forces when the sheikh was head of the Bahrain Football Association.\n___\nAP Sports Writer Rob Harris in Manchester, England, contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
