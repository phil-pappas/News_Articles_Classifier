With luck, timely plays and gridiron thievery.\nUpcoming Games Utah Football Utah football stats & schedule ASU @ Utah Rice-Eccles Stadium, Salt Lake City Oct. 17, 8:00 p.m. 1 Day 12 Hrs 44 Mins 32 Secs More Coverage Utah football notebook: Some Ute defenders have extra incentive, Thompson takes Ute Proud celebration personal Utes wary of improving Arizona State team The Utes : Lucky, good or both?\nUnbeaten in five games, they rank No. 4 in the Associated Press poll, with 16 first-place votes — more than No. 2 Baylor and No. 3 TCU . Yet they rank No. 7 in the coaches’ poll. There seems to be some confusion about what to make of the Utes — hence, the odd discrepancy between the two polls.\nBut so far, everything has been falling favorably for the team that was picked to finish fifth in the South Division of the Pac-12 Conference.\nLucky, good or both?\nThey caught Michigan early and on the Utes’ home turf, before the Wolverines turned into a runaway freight train, running over everything in their path.\nThey launched themselves deep into the national rankings by routing Oregon before anyone knew this was a weak Oregon team, one that would lose at home to Washington State two weeks later.\nLucky, good or both?\nThey collected five interceptions and a fumble recovery against Cal, but won by just seven points. They intercepted three passes against Michigan and returned one for a touchdown — the difference in the final score.\nA Cal receiver dropped an easy pass in the end zone. The Utes fended off Cal’s late drive to the 21-yard line, batting away a pass on fourth down with 4:52 left. In the same situation a year earlier, it didn’t go the Utes’ way — Washington State threw the winning TD pass with 4:51 left.\nAgainst Oregon, Tom Hackett’s punt was short, giving the Ducks great field position — but, wait, the punt hit the TV camera wire above the field. Hackett got a mulligan and this time faked the punt and ran for a first down, which launched a touchdown drive.\nThe fumbles, tipped passes and punts, the close games  they’re all going the Utes’ way.\nLucky, good or both?\nIn the big games, they’ve done just barely enough to win and they’ve done it in a scrappy, workman-like way. It ain’t pretty. How many top-five teams rank 70th in total offense? Everyone keeps crediting great defense, but the Utes rank no better than 66th in total defense. They’re gaining an average of 402 yards per game and giving up 392.\nA closer look at some of the largely ignored numbers gets to the heart of the matter. The Utes rank No. 1 in turnover margin. They have produced 10 more turnovers than their opponents. They rank No. 3 in net punting.\nThe defense and special teams have scored five touchdowns in five games.\nLucky, good or both?\nThere's something to say for a team that finds a way — any way — to win. What is it about the Utes? Willpower? Resourcefulness?\nSo here they are, sitting at high altitude in the rankings. It’s heady stuff for the Utes, who are relatively new to such recognition and still relish just being included in the top 25. Before this year, in more than a century of playing football, the Utes were voted into the top 10 a total of 22 weeks, all but four of them during the 2004 and 2008 unbeaten seasons.\nAccording to Utah’s media guide, prior to 1994 the Utes had appeared in the national rankings a total of one week, in 1947.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team110.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:19:26.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
