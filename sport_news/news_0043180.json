They show that Hurst's girlfriend told deputies he choked, slapped, punched, pushed and bit her during an argument Wednesday.\nHurst was arrested last year on charges of attempted second-degree murder and simple battery related to allegations of domestic abuse. However, those charges were dropped. Attorney Eric Hessler told The New Orleans Advocate in July 2014 that the charges were baseless and were made by an ex-girlfriend.\nHessler could not be immediately reached Thursday to learn if he is representing Hurst again. His secretary said he was in court.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
