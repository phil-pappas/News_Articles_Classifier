Auburn 2-2. \nKICKOFF: 1 p.m. at Jordan-Hare Stadium (capacity: 87,451) \nTV/RADIO: SEC Network/1590-AM \nSERIES HISTORY: Auburn leads 1-0, with a 59-13 victory at home last year. \nSTORYLINES: SJSU looks for a major upset and its first non-conference road win since 2012 (Navy) when it faces the sagging Tigers. ... Auburn was No. 6 in the AP preseason poll but edged Louisville and barely beat Jacksonville State of the FCS. The Tigers then dropped two SEC games (to LSU and Mississippi State). ... SJSU is expected to start Joe Gray at quarterback, with Kenny Potter not yet fully recovered from an ankle injury. ... The Spartans will receive $1.6 million for the game, in addition to the $1.5 they collected for playing Auburn last year. ... SJSU is a 20-point underdog. \nINJURY UPDATE: San Jose State -- RB Thomas Tucker (ankle) is out. QB Kenny Potter (ankle) is doubtful. Auburn -- DB Josh Holsey (knee) is out. WR Ricardo Lewis (undisclosed) and RB Roc Thomas (leg) are probable. \nMATCHUP TO WATCH: SJSU tailback Tyler Ervin against Auburn's defense. ... It's not 1 vs. 11, per se, but a productive game from Ervin is essential if the Spartans hope to have a chance to win in the fourth quarter. ... Ervin caught a 75-yard touchdown pass against the Tigers last year and is fresh off a 300-yard rushing game against Fresno State. ... Auburn's defense has been anything but stout against the run, yielding 216.5 yards per game. Advertisement \nSTATS THAT MATTER: San Jose State is converting 45 percent of its third downs and has scored touchdowns on 80 percent of its red zone opportunities. ... Auburn is 112th nationally in offense (344.3 ypg) and 113th in turnover margin (minus-1.25 per game). ... Special teams woes: The Spartans have made just 2 of 5 field goals this season, and punter Michael Carrizosa has mishandled the snap in back-to-back games. ... Auburn has just eight plays from scrimmage over 20 yards. -- JON WILNER", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:44:27.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
