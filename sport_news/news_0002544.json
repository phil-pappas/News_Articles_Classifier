After all those years, the schools unveiled a new trophy that will be given to the winner of the Texas Farm Bureau Insurance Shootout each season.\nDid you know the Baylor/Texas Tech game has a trophy now? pic.twitter.com/6gtawIw7jz\nâ€” Shehan Jeyarajah (@ShehanJeyarajah) September 28, 2015 \"Great college football rivalries oftentimes have a trophy and that was part of the decision,\" Baylor Associate Athletic Director Nick Joos said in a statement. \"Baylor and IMG approached [Texas] Tech about adding this component to the mix since the game will be played in Arlington for the next four years and Tech was agreeable to it.\"\nThe series is currently tied at 36-36-1 after long streaks of both Baylor and Texas Tech dominance over the years. This year's matchup is highly anticipated with Baylor currently ranked No. 5 and Texas Tech being only seconds away from pulling off an upset of No. 4 TCU last Saturday.\n\"It felt like the time was right to do something along these lines,\" Joos said.\nJoos also said the trophy is dedicated to the 73 previous games between these two schools, arching over multiple decades and conferences. It was paid for through sponsorship revenues.\nBaylor and Texas Tech will look to break their 36-36-1 gridlock at 2 p.m. on Saturday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. The game will be televised on the ESPN family of networks.\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah", "https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah/status/648564877473153024", "http://t.co/6gtawIw7jz"], "published": "2015-09-29T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:01:05.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
