(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) more > By JANIE McCAULEY - Associated   \nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - Mike McCarthy’s Green Bay Packers circled this game among the tough challenges of the first quarter of the season, facing the familiar San Francisco 49ers in the unfamiliar confines of new Levi’s Stadium for the first time. \nNot to mention during a short week with a long trip out West to face a team that had Green Bay’s number going into the fifth meeting in four seasons. \nAaron Rodgers and Co. were unfazed by it all, even if it took a little while to find a rhythm in a 17-3 victory against struggling Colin Kaepernick and the hapless Niners on Sunday to keep Green Bay unbeaten. \nLed by a relentless, swarming defense that put Kaepernick on his back six times, the Packers started 4-0 for the first time since winning their initial 13 games in 2011. \nRodgers passed for 224 yards and a touchdown and ran 17 yards to set up a key second-half score. \n“We’re 4-0, we’re first in the division and we’re playing the kind of ball we want to play in most of the phases,” Rodgers said matter-of-factly when asked to assess his team. “It was a grind out there.” \nRichard Rodgers caught a 9-yard touchdown pass on the game’s opening drive before Aaron Rodgers got his team going in the second half after a slow start to snap a four-game losing streak to San Francisco. \nThe Packers certainly hope their trip to Levi’s Stadium will be the first of two this season. The Super Bowl comes to the second-year, $1.3 billion Bay Area venue in four months for its 50th year celebration. \nHere are five things we learned Sunday: \nSTUFFING THE RUN: Green Bay certainly looked better than its No. 27 ranking stopping the run, shutting down Carlos Hyde and San Francisco’s second-ranked rushing offense. \nHyde was held to 20 yards on eight carries, while Reggie Bush was stuffed for no gain trying to go up the middle on third-and-11 in a play call that was immediately scrutinized. \nOn the ensuing drive, James Jones caught a 38-yard pass on the left sideline by barely staying in bounds. Rodgers then scrambled 17 yards to set up John Kuhn’s 1-yard scoring burst. \n“Our defense played lights out,” McCarthy said. “I think it’s our best performance so far this year. Our ability to stop the run was our starting point and I thought special teams did a heck of a job.” \nENDING THE SKID: San Francisco beat Green Bay to begin and end the year in both the 2012 and ‘13 seasons, eliminating the Packers from the playoffs after first spoiling their season openers. \nSo this win might have been a little sweeter, especially with so many cheering Cheeseheads in the crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:21:42.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
