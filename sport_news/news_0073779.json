But now, with the Browns set to host the Denver Broncos at FirstEnergy Stadium on Sunday, Turbin has a 50-50 chance to play after being listed as questionable on Friday's injury report. \n\"I am excited. I can't wait until Sunday,\" said Turbin, now in his fourth NFL season. \"It has been a long five weeks. Battling from injuries, coming back from injuries is always tough. Being released is always tough, dealing with that mentally. I am excited to have another opportunity and looking forward to making the most of it, definitely. \n\"I am going to go out there and play my game. I am not going to be overly excited or under excited. I am just going to go out there. I prepared well this week. I have been spending a lot of extra time learning the offense. I spent a lot of extra time on the field getting the footwork down the way the coaches want it. \n\"I feel ready to go. I am excited about the opportunity, and I can't wait. Obviously, being out so long, sometimes, your emotions get the best of you, but I think once kickoff starts and I get a couple carries in, all of that will settle down and it will just be football.\" \nIf Turbin is able to go on Sunday, he might find himself playing a substantial role in the offense, as running back Isaiah Crowell is questionable because of a toe injury. And he \"absolutely\" would embrace the carries, especially after spending several years in Seattle behind perennial Pro Bowl running back Marshawn Lynch. \n\"No doubt in my mind, I would be ready to carry a heavier load from a conditioning standpoint, from the knowledge of the offense,\" Turbin said. \"Crow has been great. Crow and those guys have been great teaching me some things about this offense that I didn't know, maybe some things I didn't quite understand. It has been great to have those guys around. \n\"We have each other's back. If he, for whatever reason, is limited on Sunday, as a fellow running back, it is my duty to back him up and make sure that we get the job done on the field.\" \nIf Turbin does go on Sunday, he will do so against the NFL's top-ranked defense. \nThe Broncos have surrendered a league-low 278.0 yards per game and are fifth against the run, as their opponents have averaged 85.2 rushing yards in the first five weeks of the regular season. But Turbin welcomes the challenge of possibly making his Browns debut against a top defense. \n\"They are good all around, run and pass,\" Turbin said. \"That is why they are No. 1 in the league. What we have to do offensively is be disciplined in our technique, be detailed in our assignments and just go out there and play football, be physical and execute on all cylinders on offense, and we will be fine. \n\"It is huge. Any time you can establish the running game, it makes it easier on the quarterback. It makes it easier to call plays on the offensive coordinator and you really develop a really good rhythm offensively when you can run the ball. \n\"With any game, whether you are playing a team that rushes the quarterback really well or you are playing a team that maybe isn't so good at it, I think establishing the run game is ultimately very important all the time. If we can do that, it definitely gives us an advantage in the game Sunday.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RPBDyE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:12:25.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
