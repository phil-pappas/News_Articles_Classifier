Parents and coaches began arguing on the field, and officials say Davis hit the referee in the face before leaving the field. \nThe referee suffered minor injuries. \nDavis told deputies he was trying to separate people fighting when he pushed the referee accidentally. \nDeputies say video disputes that account. \nDavis told deputies he was a coach but other witnesses said he was a parent. \nDavis was being held on $1,000 bond at the Osceola County Jail. It wasn't clear whether he'd hired a lawyer to contact for comment. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:14:40.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
