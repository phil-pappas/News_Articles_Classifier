But this good? “Way better than I expected,” Steckel said, calling it a Football Championship Subdivision version of what the Southeastern Conference is to major-level football. “I didn’t watch a lot of video (of Valley teams) because I was worried about us. I’m still worried about us. But as I’m watching video, man, this is a great league.” The Bears have been outscored 167-56 in three Valley defeats. They play at the University of South Dakota — the only team picked below them in the Valley’s preseason poll — on Saturday. \nIt might be the last legitimate chance for a Missouri State victory. But South Dakota got everyone’s attention last week, upsetting four-time defending FCS national champion North Dakota State on the road. Suddenly, what looked like a possible break on the Missouri State schedule, looks daunting. \nHere are three things to know about the Coyotes: Running back question: South Dakota’s elation over its victory last week didn’t last long. Running back Trevor Bouma, the league’s sixth-leading rusher, broke his arm on the final drive and will miss the rest of the season. Bouma accounted for 174 yards against the Bison. Coach Joe Glenn said freshmen Michael Fredrick and Nate Gunn, with a combined 330 rushing yards this season, will fill in. Rock-solid defense: Opponents have a difficult time running the ball against the Coyotes, who rank second in the league in rushing defense at 143 yards per game. That’s potentially a bad thing for Missouri State, which continues to struggle in getting its running game in gear. Red means go: Missouri State’s struggling defense needs to keep South Dakota from reaching the “red zone” or area inside the 20-yard line. That’s because once there, the Coyotes are a near-cinch to score, getting 13 touchdowns and four field goals in 18 red zone trips this season. That efficiency is best in the Valley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:08:42.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
