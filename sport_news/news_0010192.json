And while both sides said during Thursday's workouts that previous rancor has been forgotten, the emotionally charged atmosphere of playoff baseball means there could be some short fuses in the opener Friday night.\n\"It's over with. We've got to move forward,\" insisted the Royals' Edinson Volquez , who will start Game 1 and was arguably the biggest instigator when the teams met in August.\nIt was Volquez whose inside pitching drew the ire of the Blue Jays, eventually leading to the first of those bench-clearing moments. And after the game, he called Blue Jays star Josh Donaldson \"a little baby\" for complaining about his inside pitching.\nThe Blue Jays, who start Marco Estrada in the opener, won three straight elimination games against Texas to reach their first AL Championship Series since 1993. The last of those games Wednesday was as tense as they come.\nAfter the Rangers took the lead on a fluke play, the Blue Jays stormed back thanks in part to three Texas errors. Donaldson's blooper tied the game, and Jose Bautista capped the comeback with a long three-run homer, emphatically flipping his bat nearly as high in the air.\nBautista's reaction wasn't taken well by the Rangers, who essentially called it bush league.\nCubs: Shortstop Addison Russell will not play in the NLCS because of a strained left hamstring. ... Manager Joe Maddon has named Jon Lester his starting pitcher for Game 1 with Jake Arrieta slated for Game 2.\nCardinals: Catcher Yadier Molina had surgery Thursday for a ligament injury to his left thumb. General manager John Mozeliak says Molina is expected to be restricted from baseball activities for two to three months. He anticipates Molina will be ready for spring training. Mozeliak doesn't believe Molina worsened the injury by returning to the lineup for the NLDS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:59:27.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
