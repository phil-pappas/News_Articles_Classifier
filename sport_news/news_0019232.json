The rigorous classification proved to be difficult for some participants where the medical staff assessed the strength, balance, mobility, extent of the disability and then monitored the practice and competition to obtain a benchmark for a new system. \nThe system was to grade the participants from 1 to 10, 1 being minimal disability maximum ability and 10 being maximum disability minimal ability. \nProf. Bernardi was tasked to develop the system for submission to the International Paralympic Committee later this year for approval. \nThe former CPP General Secretary, who uses a wheel chair as a result of a motor accident, said he was fortunate to meet with Tony Brogden, a representative of New Zealand and a former three time world champion. \nMr Brogden took the lawyer and former General Secretary of the CPP under his wing and dedicated a huge proportion of his time in coaching him and getting him ready for the event. \nThis was crucial and the results of his fantastic efforts gave Mr. Greenstreet the confidence and ability to compete as well as he did.
