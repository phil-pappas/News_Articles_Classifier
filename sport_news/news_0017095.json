This year’s story theme is “Scarred for Life.” Contestants are invited to tell an original, nearly true tale on Friday evening at the Murphys Old School House. The Story Slam, sponsored by the Murphys Business Association, is free to the public, but donations to the Mother Lode Storytelling Guild are accepted. Gold Country Roasters will be on hand with refreshments. “We have another great contest night planned,” said event coordinator Colleen Nunn. “Last year over 80 people of all ages attended. We heard great stories with some real winners. So we decided to do it again!” Nunn points out that there are five basic rules: First, stories should be mostly true and original. Second, stories should stick to this year’s theme “Scarred for Life,” but broad interpretations are allowed. Third, stories must be told, not read. Fourth, tellings need to stay at seven minutes or under. Fifth, stories ought to have a clear beginning, middle and ending. “We hope your story will make people laugh or cry,” Nunn said. “We just want everyone to have fun!” Sign-ups will take place that evening, beginning at 6:45 p.m. “We should have time for about 10 storytellers,” Nunn said. She also noted that there is no age restriction for the contest, nor does the Guild restrict content. “We’d like the storytellers to keep in mind that there might be kids in the audience, but this is mostly a night for adults and cutting loose with words,” she said. Returning as emcee is actress and director Tara Kayton. “Last year Tara was hilarious and to the point,” said Guild president B.Z. Smith. “She kept the evening lively and moving along. This young woman is quick-witted and very smart. And we have our giant gong back, too!” Last year, Kayton was in charge of ringing the huge gong when a teller went over the seven-minute mark. The audience was in stitches of laughter as the actress teased the tellers with the threat of being gonged off-stage. “Everything is done in good spirit, and we all had a great time,” Smith said. Along with Kayton as emcee, three judges will pick the top three winners. “The judges work with a list of criteria,” she said. “They’re mostly looking for really well-told tales.” Three top prizes are awarded: $25 to third place; $50 to second place; and $75 to first place. “We’ve added a new prize this year, too,” said MLSG officer and storyteller Claudia Tonge “We’re going to have a People’s Choice category. Audience members can vote by putting tips in boots for their favorite tellers. This way everyone wins.” Since the event is also a fundraiser for next year’s Sierra Story Winds Retreat and for community storytelling projects, MLSG will host a raffle during the evening. “Along with our upcoming retreat, our local Guild is working with ATCAA’s Head Start to bring Guild members in to tell tales for their preschoolers,” Tonge said. “The funds will be used to pay our tellers transportation stipends to drive to the many Head Start schools in three different rural counties.” The Mother Lode Storytelling Guild is a part of the National Storytelling Network, an organization that works to promote storytelling in all areas of community life and to support all levels of storytellers from novice to professional. • What: Story Slam. • When: Friday, 7 to 9:30 p.m. • Where: Murphys Old School House, 115 Jones St. • Admission: Free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:18:22.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
