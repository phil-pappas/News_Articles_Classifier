India thus remained at the bottom of the Group D points table and now have virtually no chance to qualify even for the Asian Cup by finishing third. For the winners, Gubanch Abylov scored the first goal in the 9th minute while Arslanmynat Amanov scored the winner in the 66th minute. For India, Jeje Lalpekhlua had equalised in the 29th minute. With the team’s training severely hampered due to the Indian Super League (ISL) preparations, the national team players did not have any motivation as they were practically out after losing the first three matches. This defeat also puts national coach Stephen Constantine’s future in doubt as the Indian team under him has gone bad to worse in the last year or so. India had the first chance of the game as Francis Fernandes lined up a shot, only to blast it inches wide of the post. Turkmenistan managed to take the lead against the run of play just two minutes later as Abylov hit on the counterattack. However, India equalised in the 29th minute. The Turkmenistan keeper Mammet Orazmuhammedow parried a shot but Lalpekhlua, who was lurking in the box, placed a nice overhead lob to make it 1-1. The hosts went ahead again in the 66th minute as Amanov’s smart finish made it 2-1. Later, Jeje had a chance to again restore parity but his powerful header was directed straight at the keeper, who collected it with ease. India had a golden opportunity to equalise in the 86th minute as Robin Singh had only the goalkeeper to beat, but he failed to score. That was the last chance for the Indians, who now would have an opportunity to salvage some of pride when they take on Guam. Score\nIndia 1 (Lalpekhlua 29th); Turkmenistan 2 (Abylov 9th, Amanov 66th) Team stranded\nThe Indian team got stranded in Ashgabat because of bad weather. India were to travel to Muscat, Oman via Dubai for their World Cup qualifier on October 13. But the team got stuck at the Ashgabat International Airport due to the late arrival of flights. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:08:33.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
