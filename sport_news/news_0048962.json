Prescott beat La Joya in three sets. Scores Brian M. Bergner Jr. The Daily Courier PRESCOTT - Erinn Marroquinn had eight assists and five kills, Alex Koehler added seven kills and the No. 8-ranked Prescott volleyball team earned a 3-0 sweep against lowly La Joya Community on Tuesday night.Koehler said the match against La Joya was a good opportunity for the Badgers to work on some things on offense and defense.\"You definitely have to keep your level of play high and not play down to the competition,\" Koehler said. \"Our team is starting to work well together and things are coming together. After senior Bailey Anderson recorded her first of four kills on the night to give the Badgers a 12-3 lead in game one, La Joya head coach Greg Owen called a timeout in attempt to rally his squad. It didn't work, however, and Prescott used a 13-5 run to win game one, 25-8.When asked how she handles her squad playing against an opponent not up to par with the Badgers, Prescott head coach Shellie Bowman said focus is important.\"Basically I just told them that they need to work on things that they need to work on. Getting our passes a little bit lower, getting our serves in and staying focused for the whole entire time and playing with as much energy throughout,\" Bowman said. \"I thought they did pretty good considering the play tonight.\"In game two, Prescott (18-10 overall) led 19-5 before junior Grace Hendricks recorded a kill to give the Badgers a win, 25-9. Hendricks had four services aces and 13 digs against the Lobos.By game three, La Joya (5-13 overall) trailed 17-6 after a service error by sophomore Jalen Lewis and her Lobos packed it in after that as the Badgers took the sweep, 25-14.Other standouts Tuesday night included senior Blake Johnson, who had 12 digs, one kill and two ace serves while junior setter Allie Jo Amos had 11 assists. Junior outside hitter Abbey Smith had eight kills and junior Ashlynn Uvila finished her night with five kills.With the win, the Badgers have won four of their last five power point matches, and are currently ranked No. 8 in the AIA Power Point Polls in Division II.Next up, Prescott will travel south to play St. Mary's on Thursday, Oct. 15. Koehler said she didn't know much about St. Mary's, but the Badgers will be \"prepared for anything.\"Bowman hopes her team's solid performance in this past weekend's Jaguar Invitational Tournament at Desert Ridge, where the Badgers made it to the tournament semi-finals before losing to Sandra Day O'Connor, 2-1, will help with Thursday's match.\"We started off really strong Friday, but Saturday we had a little bit of a lull there, but they were playing really hard,\" Bowman said. \"It was nice to see them come back and get into the semi-finals. St. Mary's is kind of scrappy and they play hard so we'll just see what happens when we go.\"St. Mary's is ranked No. 38 in the Division II poll. Game time is scheduled for 6 p.m. Follow Brian M.
