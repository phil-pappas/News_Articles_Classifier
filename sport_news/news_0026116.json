Arkansas stalled near midfield when punter Toby Baker took off. \nHis fake punt needed five yards. \nIt got two. \nSo Alabama used the short 43-yard field to score what became the game-clinching touchdown in a 27-14 win over the visiting Razorbacks . If the visitors were looking to strike back from the 81-yard Calvin Ridley touchdown moments earlier, the failed fake punt flat didn't work. Freshman Shawn Burgess-Becker got the tackle as the Alabama defense swarmed. \nWATCH IT: Video of the failed fake punt \nAlabama coach Nick Saban said they were aware of the potential for deception. \n\"We told them to watch out for it,\" he said. \"We had been going punt safe, and we had a little better field position. We didn't know if they would do it, so we had a return on, but we had practiced that against the return as well, and the guys did a good job of responding to it.\" \nRELATED: Analysis of Alabama's win over Arkansas \nArkansas coach Bret Bielema explained his thought process as well. \n\"Alabama does a scheme where they bail a guy out and they rush three. We thought that was an opportunity to run a sweep to our right. We didn't want to go to it unless we couldn't get anything going. We continued to stall out offensively and I could feel the momentum starting to slide the other way. Unfortunately, we went to log the defense. (Alabama tight end Michael Nysewander) comes off the edge every time and we stand flat. We wanted to log it and go around it. I think Toby read it as we were trying to kick it off and go off the side and they ran into each other.\" \nNysewander kept Baker from getting outside, forcing him back into the middle of the field where a host of Alabama tacklers were waiting. Alabama defensive back Shawn Burgess-Becker (27) and linebacker Keith Holcombe (42) take down Arkansas punter Toby Baker (37) as Baker attempted a fake punt during the third quarter of Alabama's football game with Arkansas. Vasha Hunt/vhunt@al.com \nAlabama needed seven plays to score on a three-yard pass to Richard Mullaney. It gave the hosts a 17-7 lead with 12:49 left after trailing 7-3 in the closing moments of the third quarter. \n\"It felt great,\" Mullaney said. \"Our defense and special teams have been playing really good and to have that happen was huge for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:40:00.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
