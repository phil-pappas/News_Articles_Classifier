Also making an appearance were the two classes of Wicked Good Vintage Racers. \nWiscasset Speedway celebrated the season’s end with driver awards, presentations, and a pig roast for friends, drivers, their families, fans and speedway staff. \nStarting off the racing action were the two divisions of the Wicked Good Vintage Racers. \nIn the first division, Late Models and Modified pitted their skills against each other and raced to the finish. By lap six, Jody Lewis had taken the lead and did not relinquish it. Zac Poland and Keith Smalley battled for second. Poland edged Smalley during lap 15 of the 20-lap feature. Lewis sped under the checkered in first. Poland took second. Rounding out the top three was Smalley. \nThe second division of the Wicked Good Racers were the Outlaw class competing in a 20-lap event. Starting at the pole was Steve Reny. Reny and Arthur Hannaford fought for the lead. In what was a heartbreaker for Reny, Hannaford took the lead during the final lap when Reny’s car slowed on the track, appearing to suffer a mechanical issue. The battle for third was between Mark Theranault and Scott Tucker. During lap 18, Theranault secured third, and despite Tucker’s best efforts, he slid to fourth. Hannaford took the win. Reny finished in second. Theranault placed third. \nRegular racing divisions hit the track to the delight of the gathered fans. Making the first appearance in a 25-lap feature were the NAPA Super Streets. Starting at the pole was Tasha Dyer. Dyer exhibited the skills needed to secure a win in the division, and sped to victory despite serious challenges from Dalton Gagne and Mark Lucas. Lucas and Gagne vied for the lead, but when those attempts eluded them, they fought for second. During lap 17, Lucas made a pass on the inside of the back stretch to snatch second from Gagne. Gagne later failed to pass postrace inspection, which brought Josh Bailey to third. Dyer took the win from the men. Lucas placed second and Bailey third. \nIt was a slow pace for the Outlaw Mini 25-lap feature. Spinouts and accidents slowed the action for the first 15 laps of this event, and the race ended under a yellow and checkered. Making an appearance in the division was New England 4-Cylinder Pro Stock racer Jacob Hendsbee. Hendsbee demonstrated that his talents translated well to the Outlaw Mini class. \nHendsbee quickly moved from his fourth-place start to the lead by lap seven. Mike Wilson was a contender in the top three, but a ride off the turn three corner during lap nine ended his hopes of a top-five finish. Shane Kaherl started at the pole. Kaherl and Jimmy Childs made contact during lap nine, which took Kaherl out of competition. Cody Tribbet filled the void in the top three, along with Mike Bolduc. Bolduc spun on the track during the final lap, however, and Shawn Kimball took third. Tribbet placed second. Taking the win was Hendsbee. \nA 30-lap Late Model Sportsman feature was action-packed and kept fans on the edge of their seats until the finish. Going head-to-head for the win were T.J. Watson and Chuck Colby. Colby's and Watson’s battle for the lead kept racing action tense. Watson had the lead after Ben Erskine spun on the opening lap. Second was held by Colby. Third was held by Nick Hinkley, who passed Will Collins during lap three. Hinkley patiently waited for Watson or Colby to make a mistake. However, the pair skillfully avoided error, and instead raced door-to-door for nearly the entire race. Colby predominantly held the outside track, and although he tried at times to get under Watson, Watson effectively held him off. \nA determined Watson and an equally driven Colby sped across the finish line with only 8/100ths of second between them. The narrow victory was secured by Watson. Colby settled for second. Hinkley took third. \nA 25-lap New England 4-Cylinder Pro Stock race demonstrated the skills of the top drivers in the class. An early leader in the race was Alex Waltz. Waltz dominated until lap 12, when an unfortunate spin took him out of contention for a top three win. Kamren Knowles and Jacob Hendsbee were quickly at the front of the pack behind Waltz, both eager for a win. Knowles and Hendsbee made contact during lap nine, which sent both into spins, and both were sent to the back of the pack. Demonstrating the skills that made both points leaders in the division, the duo made their way skillfully through the field and back into contention for the win by lap 14. Ryan Hayes gave both a battle for top-three honors. However, Hayes slid to third as Knowles and Hendsbee took first and second. Knowles, points champion in the division, took first. Hendsbee placed second. Hayes finished third. \nA 25-lap Strictly Street event sped by quickly after two early cautions were out of the way. New faces appeared in the top three of this feature, but those new faces had to contend with points champ of the division, Kyle Hewins. Hewins started in ninth, but by lap three, Hewins had worked his way into the top three. Matt Dow started in fourth, and took the lead early in the race. Drew Morse also quickly entered the top three by lap five. The laps ticked off as the trio put on a show in this close-quarter race. Hewins was in the lead by lap five. Dow was second. Third was occupied by Morse. Heavy competition marked the race, but a masterful Hewins was able to defend the lead, showing the fans the skills that made him a season winner. Hewins took the checkered. Dow placed second and third was Morse. \nStarting at the pole of the Pro Stock race was veteran track champion and multi-time winner of previous points championships at Wiscasset, Scott Chubbuck. Chubbuck quickly showed the crowd how to win a 30-lap feature event. Chubbuck did have his hands full with hard charger Nate Tribbet, whom had started second from the back. Chubbuck also had to contend with James Osmond and Mike Orr. Orr started in second but slid behind during lap 16, which ended in a top-three finish for him. Osmond and Tribbet filled the void by Orr when Orr’s car slowed on the track. Osmond held second until lap 26. Tribbet then rallied, and passed Osmond on the outside. Tribbet was unable to catch race leader Chubbuck, and took second. Osmond finished in third. Chubbuck took the win. \nA 20-lap Thunder 4 Mini feature was quick and action-packed. When the green flag flew, there was a mad dash as all 11 Thunders rushed for the lead. There were numerous leader changes, but when the dust cleared, the cream had risen to the top and Joe Katula had taken the lead. Kyle Hewins had advanced to second. Noah Haggett, cruising in his new whip, was in third. During lap eight, Haggett went into a spin, and a caution was called. On the restart, Katula was too slow off the start and lost his lead to Hewins. Michael Moody was watching in his rear view mirror as 10th-place starter Jeff Minchin Jr. advanced up the track. Moody had his hands full as Minchin battled him for his third position. Minchin won the fight, and finished in third. Although Katula skillfully tried to take the win, Hewins held him off, and secured the first-place finish. Katula had to be satisfied with second. \nA 25-lap Modified feature concluded the action for the night. Putting on a show was Allen Moeller and Adam Chadbourne. Chadbourne and Moeller raced for the lead off the start. Chadbourne overtook Moeller to secure first. However, moving up from the back, was points champion and 11-time season winner in the division, Mark Lucas. Lucas overtook Moeller, but found himself with his hands full trying to pass Chadbourne. Chadbourne and Lucas raced door-to-door. Lucas took the lead during lap six, going over the line just 8/1000ths of a second ahead. Lucas was able to slip in ahead of Chadbourne several laps later. Chadbourne put up a fight, and showed the gathered fans that Lucas would not cruise to an easy victory. Lucas did take the win, but Chadbourne was hot on his heels. Moeller finished third. \nPostrace the drivers, families, staff and fans gathered to celebrate the season end with a pig roast while awards were distributed. A full list of award winners can be found on the homepage at wiscassetspeedway.com. \nThree promoter’s awards were given this year. “The promoters award is given to staff members, volunteers and drivers from Wiscasset Speedway who have gone above and beyond the call of duty and have helped make the speedway an even better place,” said track promoter Ken Minott. \nThis year’s awards went to Penny Shorette, the Kid’s Club volunteer who did so much for the children of the fans of Wiscasset Speedway. The second promoter’s award went to James Bailey, the tire barn manager at the track. Bailey went above and beyond, and pitched in where ever a helping hand was needed. The third promoter’s award went to driver Scott Chubbuck. Chubbuck has worked to make Wiscasset Speedway a better place. Chubbuck often was found lending a hand to other drivers or giving advice when asked. \nThis year two “Team Spirit Awards” were presented to the teams who raced each week with enthusiasm for the sport and helped each other throughout the year, a dedication to racing, and who were good representatives of the sport. This year's awards went to the St. Clair racing family: Josh, Ryan, Puncin and Dave St. Clair.

Adam Chadbourne put up a good fight, and finished 24 points behind Bailey.

Martin finished an astounding 78 points ahead of Michael Harrison, her closest competitor. \nOutlaw Mini driver,Cody Tribbet was this year’s points champion. Tribbet was a solid contender throughout the season, and his efforts paid off. Tribbet held off all competitors to finish 58 points ahead of Jimmy Childs, who held second in the division. \nKyle Hewins, a new driver this year at Wiscasset, was the Strictly Street champion. Dan Brown was close on his heels, only 16-points shy of the champ. \nThis year’s Late Model champ was Will Collins. Collins and Shane Clark went down to the wire for this season’s points championship. Clark came in a close second to Collins’ 20-point lead. \n“It was a pretty good year,\" Collins said. \"We sort of fell off a little bit towards the end, but a lot of it was just bad luck. All the guys worked real hard to keep it together for me this season. I want to thank dad, MG, Randy, Andy, Guy, Scott and Ryan. All those guys really won it for me. I also want to thank my sponsor Breakwater Design and Build. Next year will be the same, running Late Model and trying to defend it. A big thank you to all my fans out there.\" \nFor the second year in a row, Kamren Knowles, the 15 year old from West Gardiner, won points championship in the New England 4-Cylinder Pro Stock division. Forty points separated Knowles from his closest competitor, Jacob Hendsbee. \nOnly a few points separated Andy Saunders from points leader Jeff Burgess heading into the final Pro Stock points race of the season.
