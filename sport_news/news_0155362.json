(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Parkview Vikings couldn't have drawn it up any better. Anthony Riley and Chavis Nguyen rushed for 259 yards and three touchdowns and the Parkview defense pitched a shutout as the Vikings blanked Hillcrest 28-0 on Thursday night at John F. Kennedy Stadium.\"Hillcrest has some big play threats,\" Parkview coach Anthony Hays said. \"For us to get the shutout, I think that'll be a big confidence booster for our defense.\" CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS Hillcrest (0-7) struggled to get its offense moving. The Hornets went three-and-out on each of its first two drives. After each drive, Parkview responded with a touchdown. Before the Hornets offense had run seven plays, they were trailing 14-0.\"We just didn't make any plays tonight at all,\" Hillcrest coach John Beckham said. \"We struggled in just about every area of the football game. It just wasn't a very good football game on our part.\" Riley capped off a seven play, 51-yard opening drive with a two-yard touchdown plunge, putting the Vikings in front 7-0 early in the first quarter. After they got the football back, Parkview drained the clock with a seven minute drive, finished by Nick Cole's one-yard quarterback sneak.\"With our type of offense, to play with a two-score lead early like that, you can relax a little bit,\" Hays said. \"You can get that ground attack going, keep the defense off the field and keep them fresh so when they have to face (Hillcrest's) spread attack, they're ready to go.\" Hillcrest quarterback Isaiah Harwood completed 11 of 22 passes for 64 yards and ran for 32 yards on 10 attempts. Lavell Hale caught three passes for 41 yards The Hornets managed only 123 yards of total offense on the night. Riley and Nguyen combined for 133 yards in the first half alone.\"I think our offense has really come together over the past three weeks,\" Hays said. \"Anthony Riley's a great kid that works hard and is a team-first guy. It's really nice to see Chaviz Nguyen develop as a change of pace. Nick Cole has become way more efficient over the last three weeks. We're able to hit some play-action passes, which keeps the defensive backs honest.\" Cole completed four of nine passes for 54 yards. Riley ran for 170 yards on 30 carries. Nguyen tallied 89 yards on 19 carries.\"It's great having Chaviz back there,\" Riley said. \"(The defense) might be looking at me, so having the double threat back there helps us a bunch.\" The Vikings led 21-0 at halftime before Nguyen added a 9-yard score midway through the third. It was a dominating performance from Parkview--one that didn't sit well with Beckham and the Hillcrest coaching staff.\"I thought last week against Kickapoo, I thought we played hard for 48 minutes,\" Beckham said. \"I don't really feel that way tonight. I don't feel we played hard for 48 minutes. That's on me. Somewhere along the line, I'm not communicating with these kids the way I need to. It's really frustrating right now.\" Hillcrest 0 0 0 0 0 Parkview 7 14 7 0 28 Scoring 1Q-7:04--Riley 2-yd TD run; Joy PAT (7-0) 2Q-9:35--Cole 1-yd TD run; Joy PAT (14-0) 2Q-3:03--Riley 10-yd TD run; Joy PAT (21-0) 3Q-5:16--Nguyen 9-yd TD run; Joey PAT (28-0)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:51:39.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
