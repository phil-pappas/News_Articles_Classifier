He was very much about personalities and working you out. I used to feel I was never given enough credit. Me and Vidic used to talk about it quite a lot.\" \nFerdinand, who won six Premier League titles in his time at the club, admits that Ferguson's 'tough love' management was difficult to work under, but that it got the best out of him, particularly at a young age. \n\"Sometimes there's situations during your career you think, 'Am I getting the credit I feel I deserve?' But, at the same time that is one of the things that maybe pushed me on to keep improving year in, year out, to sustain and stay at that level for all them years,\" he said. \n\"I think I needed, as a person, for something to try and get to and grasp onto. If I had everything at one time, it might have been detrimental to my growth, maybe.\" \n\"He spoke to me and said: 'Your personality, if I had given you too much credit you might have gotten carried away, when you were younger, especially,'\" Ferdinand added. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
