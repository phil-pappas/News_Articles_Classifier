(AP) - In case you were wondering, Lockport's 1951 Chevrolet fire truck isn't for sale.\nRefurbished in 2013, the truck serves as a public relations tool for the Lockport Volunteer Fire Department, showing up at events throughout the town. It's been in Mardi Gras and Christmas parades, and residents take pictures with it at the annual Night Out Against Crime.\nFire Chief Armand Autin tells The Courier ( http://bit.ly/1jT9YkR ) the department spent $10,000 to $12,000 and used two local mechanics to get the truck running again. The money came from fundraisers, not taxpayers.\nFire Capt. Reola Lanegrasse Sr. says he worked on the truck for nearly five months, redoing the running boards, cleaning the hoses and getting the lights and sirens working. He added new tires and the seat covers and floorboard the truck would have had in 1951.\nInformation from: The Courier, http://www.houmatoday.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
