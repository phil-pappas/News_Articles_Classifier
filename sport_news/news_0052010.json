FIFA's ethics commission is reportedly considering suspending the embattled president for 90 days as the corruption scandal of soccer's governing body continues. \nBlatter's status as FIFA president is currently up in the air, with some reporters saying Blatter has been \"provisionally suspended\" and others saying a suspension is forthcoming. What many agree on, though, is that Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini were both brought up at FIFA's recent ethics commission meeting. \nBlatter is under investigation by Swiss authorities and could still face criminal charges for an alleged \"disloyal payment\" he made to Platini, who is a FIFA presidential hopeful.

Chung is facing a nearly two-decade suspension from FIFA for wrongdoing surrounding South Korea's 2022 World Cup bid. (Video via Arirang ) \nBlatter, Platini and Chung have all denied allegations against them. Blatter told a German newspaper Tuesday he doesn't plan on resigning immediately but said he will continue to fight until he steps down — as planned — in February.
