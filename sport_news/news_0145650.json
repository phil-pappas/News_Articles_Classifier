These last two contests our guys have done exactly that and I think we have done it against good teams.\" The Hornets will be facing another good team this weekend when Southern comes to town. The Jaguars (2-2/2-0 SWAC) are undefeated in SWAC play and have had an extra week to prepare for the Hornets. \"We have another phenomenal team coming in this week,\" Jenkins said. \"We are definitely going to have to play four complete quarters of football.\" The last two SWAC games the Hornets have played in they have been able to score more than 40 points in each outing. The same is true for Southern as they have scored 50 points in each of their two conference game. ASU's Jenkins is hoping it will not be that kind of shootout Saturday at ASU Stadium. \"I hope not (a shootout) because they have bigger guns than we have and more bullets,\" Jenkins added. \"It's always good to have some offensive production and put some points on the board and it just goes to show what kind of offensive staff I have. I have a veteran offensive coordinator in and he made whatever adjustments needed to be made for the offense to be productive and I commend him for all the things that are happening right now.\" Saturday's kick off is set for 6 p.m. and in observance of Breast Cancer Awareness, all fans are encouraged to wear pink to the game. The game will be broadcast on the ASU Hornets Sports Network and on Sirius Radio 113 and XM 204.
