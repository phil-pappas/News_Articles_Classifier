This week, the Kings shifted Lucic to skate with Carter and Toffoli, and dropped Pearson to the third line, and the move seems to have potential for all.\n\nToffoli and Lucic connected on a gorgeous cross-ice pass this week, one that led to a power-play goal and was particularly impressive given that they had never before played on a line together.\n“I think we know that things change throughout a season,’’ Toffoli said. “You look at last year and things changed all the time. We’ve just got to find a way to get consistent and roll with it.’’\nToffoli, in his third full NHL season, has displayed the ability to thrive with different linemates and in all situations. Already this season, he has a power-play goal and a shorthanded goal.\n\nToffoli is also important to helping the Kings’ image. At 6-foot-1, 196 pounds, he has 30-goal potential and the ability to play in all situations.\n\nNow on a line with two large linemates – Carter is 6-4, 212 pounds, Lucic is 6-3, 225 pounds – Toffoli brings some burst and skill, and helps counter the theory that the Kings are too slow and heavy to thrive in what seems to be an increasingly quick league.\n\n“Every team is different,’’ Toffoli said. “We won the Stanley Cup two years ago, and the game hasn’t changed that much in two years. We want to play the way we are successful. We have bigger guys, but they’re big guys who can skate, so we have to move our feet.’’\n\nON THE EDGE \n\nThe Kings have made themselves at home in the Staples Center penalty box, and that’s not a good thing. Entering Sunday’s games, the Kings ranked last in the NHL with an average of 16 minutes, 45 seconds, of penalty time per game this season.\n\nLong known as a good penalty-killing team, the Kings know they’re pressing their luck. Last season, they ranked 11th in the league with a per-game penalty average of 9:04.\n\n“It’s good to be reckless, but also be reckless under control a little bit,’’ Lucic said. “That physical part of the game is something we can’t take out of our game. Especially (Kyle Clifford) and (Jordan Nolan), they are two guys who play on the edge and we need them to play on the edge. Penalties are going to happen.’’\n\nNOT QUITE YET \n\nVeteran defenseman Matt Greene missed a second consecutive game because of an upper-body injury. Greene participated in the morning skate but said he needs a bit more time to return to game shape.\nThe Kings did not make any changes to their defensive pairings Sunday.\n\nWEIRD START \n\nLess than two weeks into the season, the Kings have already had scheduling quirks. They had four days between home games last week, and now they will have three days off before Thursday’s game at San Jose. That starts a stretch of four games in six days, in three time zones.\n“You get used to it,’’ Sutter said. “It’s just the way the schedule works.’’\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:14:18.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
