It would be nothing without you guys.” \nFrodeno, who was third last year, also is the reigning Ironman 70.3 world champion and won the 2008 Beijing Olympics. \nHonduras defeats USA \nSANDY, Utah \nThe United States lost to Honduras 2-0 Saturday in a men’s Olympic soccer qualifier, complicating the Americans’ path to the Rio de Janeiro Games. \nHonduras is now set for the Olympics. It got a goal in each half from Alberth Elis to win this semifinal from the group representing North and Central America and the Caribbean. \nThe U.S. under-23 team will need to win the third-place game Tuesday to advance to play Colombia in a playoff and earn one last shot at the 2016 Olympics. \nBefore Saturday’s game, the U.S. had a 2-1 record in men’s Olympic qualifying semifinals. It beat Guatemala in 2000 and Canada in 2008 and lost to Mexico in 2004. \nElis struck first in the 24th minute. Kevin Alvarez set the play in motion by sending the ball to him inside the top of the box. Elis bounced it off his chest and lobbed the ball over two defenders, threading it inside the left post. \nThe U.S. played sloppily for long stretches in the first half and created few scoring chances — with two total shots during the first 45 minutes. Honduras had five total shots and two shots on goal. \nStaff/wire report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:44:08.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
