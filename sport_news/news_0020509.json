Should Ko win in South Korea this week, she would wrest the crown away from Park, who surpassed her 18-year-old rival in June when she prevailed in the first of two major events this season.\nYou thought race between Spieth/McIlroy/Day was close? Check LPGA's supremacy battle between Lydia Ko and Inbee Park: pic.twitter.com/QUjA6mVCJb\n— Steve Elling (@EllingYelling) October 13, 2015\nAll of that is white noise to Ko, who converted an 18-foot birdie put on the final hole on Friday for a 7-under 65, and the second-round lead at the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship in South Korea.\n\"The closer we get or if there is a switch, the media is going to talk about it,\" Ko told reporters after coming from seven strokes back to take a one-shot advantage over Lexi Thompson. \"But, you know, I'm sorry, but I'm going to try and ignore you guys. I think that’s the best way.\"\nIt certainly has worked so far for the teenager, who this year added her first major title, the Evian Championship, to her impressive resume that includes nine LPGA Tour wins. She is tied with Park with four victories this year.\nAfter a T2 last week in Malaysia that followed back-to-back wins at the Evian and then in Canada, Ko will enter the weekend at 10-under. She is on pace to break the record, held by Nancy Lopez, of becoming the youngest player to reach 10 tour wins.\nWith Friday’s playing partner Park tied for 25th at 3-under, Ko is also poised to move back into first place.\nJust please stop asking her about it.\n\"When I'm out there, I'm just trying to hit a good shot and put myself in good position,\" said Ko. \"If I thought about the rankings, the awards, it's just way too much. It’s hard enough just trying to hit the ball straight out there.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://t.co/QUjA6mVCJb", "https://twitter.com/EllingYelling/status/653950643133132803"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:54:00.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
