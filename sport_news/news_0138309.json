Kiesewtter made it 2-0 in the 84th when he curled a penalty kick past goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau. \nCanada played with only 10 players the entire second half after midfielder Giuliano Frano received a second yellow card before halftime. Frano was issued yellow cards in the 32nd and 44th minutes. \nThe U.S. created plenty of scoring chances in the first half, outshooting Canada 13-2. Three of those shots were on goal. Howard returns, but U.S. loses Tim Howard made his first appearance in goal for the United States in 15 months and was unable to stop the Americans' slide. \nJoel Campbell scored in the 70th minute, and Costa Rica beat the listless U.S. 1-0 in an exhibition Tuesday night in Harrison, New Jersey. Advertisement \nThree days after a 3-2 loss to Mexico in a playoff for the region's Confederations Cup berth, the U.S. generated few scoring chances in the latest of a string of dismal performances this year that have led to criticism of coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who sent defender Fabian Johnson home for asking to be substituted late in Saturday's defeat. \nThe Americans finished fourth at this year's CONCACAF Gold Cup, their poorest performance since 2000, and are a team in transition as they head into the start of World Cup qualifying. \nHoward took a one-year sabbatical from the national team after making 15 saves in the 2-1 round-of-16 loss to Belgium at last year's World Cup. When Howard returned last month, Klinsmann installed him as his No. 2 behind Brad Guzan. Howard sat on the bench for a pair of September exhibitions and for Saturday's extra-time defeat at the Rose Bowl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:57:22.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
