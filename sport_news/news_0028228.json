On the 147-yard, par-3 No. 2, Gibson drilled a 30-footer putt for birdie, the first of six on a breezy, hot day. Starting on No. 5, the sophomore hit three consecutive birdie putts, all of which were 10 feet or longer. \n\"I never seen anyone roll in that many long putts in one round,\" said Fayetteville senior Luke Long, who played in Gibson's group and finished second with a 4-over 76. \"He was amazing.\" \nGibson figured he was in for a good round when his tee shot on the 216-yard, par-3 No. 5 landed on the green, 15 feet from the pin. \n\"I had sprayed the ball to the right on that hole during my practice round,\" Gibson said. \"I knew I couldn't do that again. ... There was a crosswind on that hole today, but I hit a good approach shot and put myself in a good spot to hit the putt.\" \nGibson followed his birdie putt on No. 5 by making a 10-footer on No. 6 and a 15-footer on No. 7. \n\"I don't think I could have done much better with my putter today,\" Gibson said. \nRogers Heritage senior Jacob Winkle also shot a 76 on Thursday. Long won a one-hole playoff with Winkle to earn the second-place trophy. \nLong also birdied No. 6, but did so in an unconventional manner. Long chipped in from 45 feet moments after telling playing partner Caleb Kubacak of Maumelle that his shot was going in the hole. \n\"I called that one before I chipped, but it was just a joke,\" Long said. \"I told Caleb that I was going to make that shot. Of course, I had no idea I would do it.\" \nLong and the other 19 competitors in Thursday's field needed more miracle shots to compete with the eventual winner. Gibson fired an even-par 36 on the back nine, including another long-range birdie putt on the 358-yard, par-4 No. 16. \n\"I started feeling too good about myself on the back half,\" Gibson said. \"Then I made a couple of bogeys. Thankfully, I got that shot back on 16 and I started feeling better again.\" \nThursday's tournament was sponsored by the Arkansas State Golf Association. \nSports on 10/16/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:09.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
