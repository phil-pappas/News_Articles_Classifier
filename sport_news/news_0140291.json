That will not be good enough in Chicago and he needs to elevate his game.\nWith his demotion Friday, the Hawks sent a message to Marko Dano that a very talented young player is not guaranteed a spot, and that he has to play hard every shift to contribute to the three-time Cup winners.\nArtemi Panarin looked really good at Notre Dame and has elite skill, but he was hurt most of the preseason and it remains to be seen how his play will translate during the regular season.\nThe Hawks are loaded with fourth line players and it's good to have grinders, but in a perfect world you wouldn't have them playing on the top three lines. As of this moment, there's certainly plenty of that.\nThe good news is a confident Teuvo Teravainen off a strong postseason should move into a much bigger role, and that's like dealing for a top six forward.\nOn defense, Trevor Daley will have to improve in his own end to step into Oduya's skates, and the final pair will probably see many different combinations throughout the year.\nThere will be a lot of movement on offense and defense and constant shuffling of players back and forth to Rockford while Quenneville gets a feel for what he has and what he needs.\nThere's no cap room to do anything extraordinary unless a big salary is moved, and that doesn't seem to be in the cards. Unless they eat a significant portion of his salary, the Hawks are stuck with Bryan Bickell.\nThere are a dozen teams with enough cap space to acquire Crawford, but there doesn't appear an interested candidate among that group, and let's not forget that Crawford was the Hawks' best player in the Stanley Cup Final the last two times the Hawks won the Cup.\nHawks management, thus far, seems well aware of that, despite a fondness for Scott Darling.\nMeanwhile, the West is as deep as ever and getting better each season, and the teams at the top will be pressed to remain there.\nSo it's another season of challenges for the Hawks following a Stanley Cup victory, hardly a new posture for them having been through it before, and this time they'll have a better understanding of what it takes.\nBesides, as long as No. 19 is around, you know he's going to find a way to keep this playoff train on the tracks.\nbrozner@dailyherald.com\nâ€¢ Hear Barry Rozner on WSCR 670-AM and follow him @BarryRozner on Twitter.\n Sports Chicago NHL Blackhawks Rozner, Barry Hockey Pro Sports", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-04T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:48:17.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
