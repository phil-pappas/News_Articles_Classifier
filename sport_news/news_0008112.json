Phil Astolfi ran onto a ball cleared out of the Southern Lehigh box and laced a low laser that left goalkeeper Torin Vanin motionless, and gave the Lions a 1-0 lead about 8 minutes into the first half. \nTop performer : Astolfi had the game’s best (and only) finish while also exhibiting a good work rate. Teammate Jack Painter, however, was the most dangerous player throughout the course of the evening against the Spartans (11-8). \nPainter tested Vanin throughout the contest and also had the game’s best pass in the second half when he picked out Nic Lozano, whose header was wide. \nWhat it means : The Lions advance to defend their league championship in Thursday’s 7 p.m. final against Northwestern at a site to be determined. Northwestern handed Moravian Academy its only league loss of the regular season in a decisive 3-0 result on Oct. 5. \nThe Lions get an opportunity for payback on a big stage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:57:42.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
