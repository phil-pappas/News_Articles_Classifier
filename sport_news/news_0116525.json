He went 3-0 with a 3.05 ERA in five games (three starts) in 2014, but was hurt during spring training of this season. Bonilla and Josh Lindblom were acquired from Philadelphia for Young, the franchise's all-time leader in games played and hits after the 2012 season.\nLindblom was sent to Oakland after 2014 for infielder Chris Bostick, who was then eventually traded for lefty Ross Detwiler. The trio of pitchers combined to go 4-8 with a 5.68 ERA in 95 innings for Texas.\nAlso, Wednesday, the Rangers outrighted catcher Carlos Corporan, first baseman Kyle Blanks and outfielders Antoan Richardson and Ryan Strausborger off the 40-man roster and DL to Triple-A Round Rock. All except Strausborger have the right to refuse the assignment.\nOn Twitter:\n @Evan_P_Grant", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Evan_P_Grant"], "published": "2015-10-22T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:05:41.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
