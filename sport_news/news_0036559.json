The adjudicatory chamber of Fifa’s Ethics Committee based its decision on the grounds that a breach of the Code of Ethics appears to have been committed and a decision on the main issue may not be taken early enough. The decision against Worawi followed a request from the chairman of the investigatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee, Dr Cornel Borbély. The case is now the subject of formal investigation proceedings. Worawi was a FIFA executive committee member for 18 years until May - including for its 2010 vote for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups - and has faced multiple allegations of wrongdoing. The 63-year-old was found guilty in July by a Thai court of forgery in his reelection as head of the Football Association of Thailand. Worawi told AFP he would fight to save his name and intended to stay in the Thai election even though he is banned immediately \"from all football activities at national and international level for 90 days.\" \"I am confused by this, I just heard the news,\" he said. \"I am not guilty of anything. Under Thai law I still have the right to appeal (the July court decision). I did not falsify anything, what I did was absolutely legal.\" His ban follows matching suspensions handed out to embattled outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter and European football boss Michel Platini last Thursday. 341 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:52:05.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
