The skid has put in peril their chance of getting home-field advantage in the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nScherzer pitched the seventh no-hitter in the majors this year, including one by San Francisco rookie Chris Heston at Citi Field on June 9. \nThis is Scherzer's first season with the Nationals after the 2013 AL Cy Young winner left Detroit and signed a $210 million, seven-year deal as a free agent. \nIn a season that has spiraled downward for the Nationals, the gems by Scherzer have been highlights. This also marked the second straight year a Washington pitcher came up big late — Jordan Zimmermann threw the first no-hitter in Nationals' history on the final day of the regular season in 2014. \nAt times, Scherzer looked as if he was simply playing catch with Wilson Ramos. Wherever Ramos put his catcher's mitt, Scherzer seemed to hit it. \nMatt Harvey (13-8) lost despite allowing just one unearned run and four hits in six innings. \nThe Nationals won the opener when Bryce Harper hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the eighth off Addison Reed (3-3). It was Harper's 42nd homer. Rafael Martin (2-0) got one out as the Nationals ended a six-game skid against the Mets. Felipe Rivero worked the ninth for his second save. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nNationals: Harper was heavily bandaged in ice after being hit by Noah Syndergaard's fastball and didn't play the second game. \"Like he threw it through me,\" Harper said. \nMets: LHP Steven Matz got an injection for his sore back and \"hopefully that helps him a lot,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. The 24-year-old rookie is 4-0. He missed two months because of a partial muscle tear on his left side earlier this season, and hasn't pitched in a game since Sept. 24. The Mets would like him to start against the Dodgers — he could get a tuneup next week in the instructional league. \nUP NEXT \nNationals: RHP Tanner Roark (4-7, 4.63) is 3-0 in five career games at Citi Field. \nMets: RHP Jacob deGrom (14-8, 2.60) starts vs. Washington for the sixth time this season. He's 2-2 with a 3.26 ERA in those outings. \n\nA list of pitchers with two or more no-hitters in a year, with name of team, date, pitcher, opponent and scores (y-denotes perfect game). \nCincinnati Reds \nJune 11, 1938, Johnny Vander Meer, vs. Boston, 3-0 \nJune 15, 1938, Johnny Vander Meer, at Brooklyn, 6-0 \nNew York Yankees \nJuly 12, 1951, Allie Reynolds at Cleveland, 1-0 \nSept. 28, 1951, Allie Reynolds vs. Boston, 8-0 \nDetroit Tigers \nMay 15 1952, Virgil Trucks vs. Washington, 6-0 \nAug. 25, 1952, Virgil Trucks at New York, 1-0 \nCalifornia Angels \nMay 15, 1973, Nolan Ryan at Kansas City, 3-0 \nJuly 15, 1973, Nolan Ryan at Detroit, 6-0 \nPhiladelphia Phillies \nMay 29, 2010, Roy Halladay, at Florida, 1-0-y \nOct. 6, 2010, Roy Halladay, vs. Cincinnati, 4-0, NLDS. \nWashington Nationals \nJune 20 — Max Scherzer, Washington vs. Pittsburgh, 6-0 \nOct. 3 — Max Scherzer, Washington at N.Y.
