The two weren't district opponents last year, although they are in 2015. \nHIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL \nAll games Friday at 7 p.m. unless indicated \nFOUR TO WATCH \nCAMDEN COUNTY (5-0, 0-0) AT VALDOSTA (4-1, 0-0 IN REGION 1- ), 8 P.M. \nThis is where the Wildcats problems began in 2014, the first of five consecutive losses in region play. How good has Region 1- been so far? Four teams sit at 5-0 and the other two (Lowndes and Valdosta) are 4-1. Camden’s multi-faceted rushing attack is led by Harrison Poole (334 yards, four TDs). \nWEST NASSAU (4-0, 0-0) AT BOLLES (5-0, 1-0 IN DISTRICT 2-4A), 7:30 P.M. \nA huge game for the Warriors, who have shown significant improvement this season. They’ve played Bolles close once in recent history, a 21-12 Bulldogs win in 2009. Everything else has been blowouts by Bolles. The Bulldogs have been tested this season, with four out-of-district games against 5A to 8A programs. QB Mac Jones (852 passing yards, 10 TDs) leads what has been a very good, very blended offense. Four backs are at 136 rushing yards or more. West Nassau has two central figures in its attack, back Davion Dubose and athlete Ke’Shan Pennamon. The last team to beat Bolles in a district game not named Raines — Nease, on Oct. 30, 1992. A win for the Bulldogs would give Corky Rogers career win No. 450. \nFLETCHER (3-2, 0-1) AT FIRST COAST (1-3, 0-0 IN DISTRICT 2-7A) \nThe Buccaneers are not what they’ve been in recent seasons, but they are still very much a factor in District 2-7A. They are good enough defensively to give any team in the area issues and will need to lean on that side of the ball. The Senators have one of the area’s top passing quarterbacks in Alec Adamec and he’s got the wideouts to stretch the field. Crisjohn Roscoe (17 catches, 430 yards, four TDs) will have First Coast’s full attention wherever he lines up. With one district loss already, this game is already in must-win territory for the Senators. \nFLEMING ISLAND (2-2, 0-1) AT OAKLEAF (4-1, 0-1 IN DISTRICT 3-7A) \nAnother game of major significance. Both programs have already taken a district loss, the Golden Eagles to Bartram Trail and the Knights to Gainesville Buchholz. A second loss puts playoff hopes on life support. Oakleaf shook out of its offensive woes last week with 48 points at Clay. So much of what Fleming does is tied to its rushing attack and the effectiveness of Trey Sneed. If Oakleaf can rein in his space to work, the Knights have a good shot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:32:37.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
