(Postmedia Network file photo) Report an error \nA woman who played for the world famous Harlem Globetrotters for close to four years is suing the team, alleging she he was sexually harassed then fired for getting pregnant, according to TMZ Sports. \nTammy Brawner, who went by the nickname T-Time during her time with the Globetrotters from 2012 to April of 2015, alleged in her lawsuit she was targeted by coach Jimmy Blacklock in a campaign of sexual harassment. Brawner’s suit alleges Blacklock would call her his girlfriend, imply she was having sex with teammates and told players to steer clear of her because “she was a seductress who would ruin their marriages,” TMZ Sports reported. \nBrawner said she confronted Blacklock and told him to stop and complained to the team’s general manager but nothing was done. \nThen, Brawner said, she was let go by the Globetrotters after returning from medical leave following a pregnancy. She alleges she was fired in retaliation for complaining about being sexually harassed. \nBrawner, a 5-foot-6 guard from Dominican University in California, became the 10th woman to play for the Globetrotters when she was hired in 2012. She is engaged to former ‘Family Matters’ star Darius McCrary.
