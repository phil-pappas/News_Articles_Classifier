If you’re homeless, you’re illegal in Puyallup,” said a person who attended a city council meeting.\n“This is not based on status of human beings’ station in life. It is based on conduct,” said Puyallup City Manager Kevin Yamamoto.\nThe policy was introduced after an unruly woman attacked a Puyallup librarian last year.\nThe News Tribune reports that anyone who has the power to issue trespass tickets will be trained first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:50:51.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
