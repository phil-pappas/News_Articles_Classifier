Guard Norman Powell led the team in scoring (16.4 points per game) and versatile forward Kevon Looney was the leading rebounder (9.4 per game).\nBut the Bruins return a bevy of talent, including Bryce Alford, the team’s second-leading scorer from a season ago (15.4), and welcome several new faces. Six-foot-10 swingman Jonah Bolden sat out last season with eligibility issues, and freshman guards Aaron Holiday and Prince Ali are four-star recruits.\nThe 6-1 Holiday is a point guard and the younger brother of former Bruins guard Jrue Holiday. The 6-3 Ali is more of a two-guard.\n“We know we’re going to have to play a little differently with our lineups,” Alford said. “We have some versatility this year that I haven’t had.”\nThat starts with Bolden, who likely replaces Looney in the starting lineup as a stretch-four, or what Alford refers to as the team’s “big guard.” They might also play 7-foot sophomore center Thomas Welsh alongside 6-9 big man Tony Parker, who can slide over to power forward, or vice versa.\n“It’s just going to be a matchup problem (for opponents),” said Parker, now a senior.\nWelsh and Parker are the team’s top returning rebounders.\nWelsh got some extra experience this summer playing for the U.S. men’s team that won the gold medal at the FIBA U19 World Championships in Greece in July.\n“It’s going to be hard for people to guard him,” Parker said. “He’s so tall, and he’s getting really, really agile.”\nOther combinations include playing four guards together on the floor, including Holiday, Ali, Alford and Isaac Hamilton. Bolden could be swapped in, as well.\nSteve Alford hopes to see what rotations work best moving forward.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:23:48.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
