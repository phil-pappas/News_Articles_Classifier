They have great speed and do a great job. You have to be prepared for a lot of different looks when you play them.”\nCal head coach Sonny Dykes\nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah’s offense has earned a lot of love from the national media, and the Utes ' defense remains the one thing people point to as the foundation of the program.\nBut when Cal coach Sonny Dykes watches game film of the Utes, he sees something more.\n“That’s the thing, when you watch Utah’s football team, you see a really good offense,” Dykes said during Tuesday’s Pac-12 teleconference. “You see a really good defense. But you see exceptional special teams.”\nHe rattled off some of Utah’s impressive special teams plays this season, including a punt and a kick returned for touchdowns, as well as the fake punt return by Britain Covey and Boobie Hobbs that resulted in a Utah touchdown against Oregon.\n“They’re a dynamic bunch,” Dykes said. “They have a lot of experience at kicker and punter; those are two good athletes, two guys with big legs. ... They have great speed and do a great job. You have to be prepared for a lot of different looks when you play them.”\nAs an example of how unusually athletic Utah’s special team athletes are, he pointed to the fact that punter Tom Hackett caught a high snap with one hand on a fake punt versus Oregon.\n“That just shows the depth they have on special teams,” he said.\nDEFENSIVE CONSISTENCY: While Dykes also praised Utah’s defense, especially the defensive line, Oregon State’s Gary Andersen offered some insight as to why the Utes have been able to maintain one of college football’s best defensive lines for more than a decade.\n“No. 1, any time you have good players, you have to look right back at the recruiting,” said Andersen, who was one of Utah’s defensive coaches from 1997-2002 and again in 2004-08. “The strength program with Doug ( Elisaia ) has been fantastic, and it’s stayed consistent. The University of Utah has stayed consistent with Kyle ( Whittingham ) and his beliefs, the way he wants to go about things. That defensive line has always had a vision of not only being good, but being great.”\nHe said sometimes success makes it easier to recruit top players, but not always. But the one thing players have always been able to rely on is Whittingham’s philosophy.\n“Kyle has a plan, and he’s stuck with his plans come good days and bad days,” Andersen said. “And he’s had a university that’s stuck with him throughout the plan.”\nEmail: adonaldson@deseretnews.com\nTwitter: adonsports", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:20:49.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
