SOU Hall of Fame Tickets are on sale now for the 2015 Southern Oregon University Sports Hall of Fame Banquet. The induction ceremony will be held Oct. 24 at 9 a.m. in the Stevenson Union's downstairs Arena on the SOU Campus and will include breakfast. The Raider athletic department is asking attendees to RSVP prior to the event and make a donation of $10, which can be paid the morning of the event. To RSVP, call 541-552-6772. This year's Hall of Fame class includes wrestlers Nick Cline and Paul Dodson, women's basketball player Julie Finch, track and field athlete Ross Kennedy and football and track and field star Terry Hendrix. The Hall of Fame class will also be honored at halftime of the SOU-College of Idaho football game on the 24th, which kicks off at 1 p.m. at Raider Stadium. Men's Basketball The Southern Oregon University men's basketball team has been picked to finish fifth in the Cascade Conference, a year after winning a school-record 26 games and making its second appearance in the national quarterfinals. The favorite in 2015-16 with seven of 10 first-place votes is College of Idaho, which won its second straight CCC regular-season and tournament titles last season but has to replace four starters and six of its top-seven scorers. Northwest Christian received three first-place votes and is second in the poll, followed by Warner Pacific – which also lost four starters from its CCC co-championship team – and Oregon Tech. After making a run to the CCC tournament championship game and winning twice at the NAIA Div. II tournament, SOU was No. 9 in the 2014-15 postseason rankings. The Raiders return eight of their top-10 rotation players from that team, though the two they lost were NAIA All-Americans Eric Thompson and Tim Weber. SOU's three starters back are seniors Joel Spear and Jordan West, and sophomore Ben DeSaulnier. West, a 6-foot-8 forward, averaged 15.1 points on 57-percent shooting, scored in double figures 26 games in a row and put up 21 per game at the national tourney. Spear started all 36 games at point guard with averages of 7.3 points, 3.1 assists and a 55-percent clip from the field, and DeSaulnier posted 11.8 points on 56-percent shooting in conference play as a true freshman guard.
