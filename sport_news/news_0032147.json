Bush, in a wheelchair and wearing a neck brace, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the American League Division Series between the Houston Astros and Kansas City Royals on Sunday.\nThe 91-year-old Bush, recovering after breaking a vertebra in his neck in a summer spill, smiled broadly when the crowd cheered after he was brought onto the field. With wife Barbara by his side, he bounced a short throw from about five feet in front of the plate to Houston's Jed Lowrie, who was set up to catch.\nBush is a longtime Astros fan with a home in Houston, and for years he attended dozens of games a year in seats just behind home plate.\nShare this page Tweet This article filed under: MLB Baseball Pro Men Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-12T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:23:33.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
