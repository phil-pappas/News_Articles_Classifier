But finding the right fitness fit can be a challenge in itself. \nA couple of years ago you would rarely find Lisa Muldbakken at the gym or studio. \n\"Exercise really isn't my cup of tea,\" Lisa Muldbakken said. \"At the time, my husband was deployed to Afghanistan so I needed something to keep me busy.\" \nThen Muldbakken found herself with some extra time, giving her a boost of encouragement to try something different. She decided to give pilates a try, and quickly became a fan. \n\"I like the exercise and I never dread coming,\" Muldbakken said. There are many benefits when it comes to pilates including elongating your muscles and increasing flexibility, as well as building up your core strength and your range of motion. \nMuldbakken was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. She needed to get a mastectomy as part of her treatment plan. \n\"You have no strength and all of your muscles are weak and so you start very slowly and build up,\" Muldbakken said. \nPilates also helps with her recovery. Trainers at Thrive Pilates participate in the Pink Ribbon Program. It helps to enhance recovery for breast cancer patients and improve strength to those areas affected by breast cancer surgery. \n\"After surgery their range of motion can be very limited so just getting the chest to open can be very empowering for them,\" Tracy Nielsen, owner of Thrive Pilates, said. \nMuldbakken is now cancer and surgery free and has gained a new perspective. \n\"Muscles strength, friendships, mental clarity. It's a win, win situation, I love it here,\" Muldbakken said. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
