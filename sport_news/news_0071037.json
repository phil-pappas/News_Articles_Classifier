JOSEPH, Mo. — With more than half of the season in the books, Washburn has provided only glimpses of what the Ichabods are hoping to accomplish this season. \nIf the Bods are going to realize their potential, WU coach Craig Schurig knows his team better start generating some momentum against Missouri Western at 2 p.m. Saturday in Spatt Stadium. \n“It’s been frustrating,” Schurig said. “It’s frustrating for coaches and players. When you’re at the game, you watch certain aspects of the game we’re doing well — as good as anybody. We’re just not consistent with it, and then we make mistakes that cost us dearly. \n“Hopefully, we can get it cleaned up. When you have a team with talent, and certain aspects that are really going well, you want to get the wins and you want to perform.” \nDespite losing back-to-back games to drop to 3-3, Washburn’s morale is still high, WU offensive lineman Michael Miller said. \n“There is a lot of confidence on the team, knowing that we are right there,” Miller said. “We just have to keep focusing and keep putting things together and play a full game — we haven’t done that yet this year.” \nMissouri Western (4-2) is coming off a 26-21 win over Fort Hays State after breaking up a pass in the end zone to seal the win. The Griffons’ two losses came by a combined five points — 18-17 to Central Missouri and 26-21 to FHSU. \nWestern running back Raphael Spencer ranks third in the conference in rushing with 646 yards, averaging 107 per game. \n“Their run game, they stay very patient with it,” Schurig said. “They’re really good at the zone-run blocking, and their back stays very patient and finds the seam. They can frustrate you in the sense that they can hold the ball for a long time. Then, just when you think you have to bring extra guys up there, they’re good at some play-action passes and they get some big plays off it.” \nThe Griffons might be without starting quarterback Syler Windmiller, who left the Fort Hays State game with a hand injury. T.J. LaFaver replaced Windmiller, completing 13 of 21 passes for 163 and two touchdowns and rushing for 81 yards. \n“LaFaver can run the ball a little more,” Schurig said. “He probably doesn’t have a grasp of the offense as great (as Windmiller), but he looks good. He adds another dynamic to their offense as far as running the ball.” \nThe Washburn defense will look to contain the Griffons early, after giving up a combined 52 points in the first half in losses to Fort Hays State and Central Missouri. \n“We just have to focus more and just relax,” WU safety Peter Pfannenstiel said. “We start off a little too timid and we don’t settle down very well. I think in the second half we settle down and relax and actually play. I think that’s what we need to do when we start off.” \nWASHBURN AT MISSOURI WESTERN \nKickoff: 2 p.m. Saturday, Spratt Stadium, St. Joseph, Mo. \nRadio: KTPK-FM (106.9) \nRecords: Washburn 3-3, 3-3 MIAA; Missouri Western 4-2, 4-2 \nNext: Central Oklahoma at Washburn, 2 p.m. Oct. 24. \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:02:31.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
