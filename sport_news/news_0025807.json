Related Clinton pledges action for LGBT Americans \nThe Campaign for Houston has been trying to take down the anti-discrimination proposition known as Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), or Proposition 1. \nThe ordinance would prohibit discrimination of any kind based on sex, race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, age, martial status, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. \nMcNair has a net worth of $3.3. billion, and brought football's Texans to Houston after the Oilers left. His contribution to the Campaign comes as the National Football League has made strides to accept gay players. \nThe league drafted its first openly gay player, Michael Sam, in February 2014. And players such as Andrew Luck and Chris Kluwe have been vocal about welcoming gay players to the league. \nCampaign for Houston spokesman Jared Woodfill confirmed Friday that McNair sent the check to the group, which says the ordinance is \"an attack on the traditional family.\" \n\"We're very excited,\" he said. \"Obviously it speaks volumes to the support we have if a hero like McNair is contributing to our campaign.\" \nProponents of HERO have said that Houston will lose the privilege of hosting the Super Bowl in 2017 if it doesn't pass. \nWoodfill said that argument was \"bogus.\" \nThe Campaign for Houston has also received support from former Houston Astros outfielder Lance Berkman. \nHERO was pushed by Mayor Annise Parker, who was elected as Houston's first openly gay mayor in 2009. \nThe proposition will come to a vote on Nov. 3. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
