The botched punt meant only that the Jets were going to win by 14 points instead of 21. “This is a good team,” the 50-year-old said.\nThe Jets faithful might have to get used to this exotic feeling called serenity. After recovering from a turnover-filled first half to win, 34-20, on Sunday, the Jets are 4-1 for the first time since 2010. Next weekend, they will play for the AFC East lead against a divisional rival they are starting to resemble: the successful-to-the-point-of-tedium New England Patriots.\nOK, you’re right. But hear this out.\nENLARGE Ryan Fitzpatrick completed 19 of 26 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns and one interception on Sunday. He also ran for an 18-yard score in the Jets’ win. Photo: peter foley/European Pressphoto Agency The Jets’ new leadership, head coach Todd Bowles and general manager Mike Maccagnan, took over a team that went 4-12 last year. As of Sunday evening, the Jets boasted the No. 1 defense in yards surrendered per game as well as the top running back in Chris Ivory, who, after accounting for 196 total yards and one touchdown on Sunday, leads the NFL in rushing yards per game.\nQuarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick had his best game of the season Sunday, throwing for 253 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. He also scrambled for an unexpected and thrilling 18-yard score in the third quarter that gave the Jets a 20-13 lead. “It’s about Fitzpatrick,” Geli said. “If he doesn’t make mistakes, they’re great. Tom Brady doesn’t make mistakes.”\nAs temperatures dipped into the mid-40s on a windy October afternoon, the chill seemed to temper expectations, even when fans should have expected a blowout. Washington, now 2-4, was without six starters, including both starting cornerbacks, two offensive linemen, tight end Jordan Reed and star receiver DeSean Jackson.\nThe Jets, on the other hand, were healthy after a bye week. They also regained defensive end Sheldon Richardson, who completed his four-game suspension for violating the league’s substance-abuse policy. But that wasn’t enough. “As a Jets fan, you’re never confident,” said John Geli Jr., 25 years old. “You’re cheering, but you’re never confident.”\nOn cue, receiver Eric Decker caught a short pass on the Jets’ first offensive play and fumbled. “Decker’s gotta hold on to the ball!” said the elder Geli, who lives with his son on Staten Island and works at a West Village financial-services firm.\nThe Redskins drove 37 yards for the touchdown, punctuated by a two-yard strike from quarterback Kirk Cousins to Pierre Garcon. But the Jets responded, with Fitzpatrick hitting Ivory for a 23-yard gain. Seven plays later, Ivory punched it in from the 1.\nThe Jets took a 10-7 lead before their demons briefly returned. After making a 13-yard catch late in the second quarter, Brandon Marshall tried to muscle past defenders for extra yards and had the ball stripped. Washington drove 19 yards for the game-tying field goal.\nThen, with 47 seconds left in the half, Fitzpatrick’s forced a pass to Marshall down the right sideline, where Redskins cornerback Bashaud Breeland picked him off. Cousins led Washington on a 40-yard field-goal drive to give the Redskins a 13-10 lead at halftime.\n“This is like the Philly game all over again,” Geli Sr. said, referring to the Jets’ sole, turnover-filled loss this season.\nBut the anxiety, and the Jets’ deficit, was discarded shortly after halftime. Ivory’s 24-yard catch set up Folk’s 39-yard field goal, and two plays later, cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted Cousins for his league-leading sixth takeaway of the season. One play later, Fitzpatrick dropped back to pass, saw a hole up the middle and ran for it, diving into the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown run.\nAfter a Washington three-and-out, Fitzpatrick unleashed a wobbly pass toward Marshall, who snagged it just above the turf and ran it for a 35-yard score. “That was the most horrible touchdown pass I’ve seen in my life!” said John McFee, Geli’s former high-school classmate.\nWith the Jets comfortably ahead, talk in the stands turned to next week’s divisional battle for first place in New England. The consensus was one befitting a 4-1 team, even if that team was the Jets: They can win. “We just gotta pressure Brady,” Geli Sr. said.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KU767_NYJETS_J_20151018202620.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KU767_NYJETS_P_20151018202620.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KU767_NYJETS_M_20151018202620.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:41:41.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
