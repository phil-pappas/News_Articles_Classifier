A large number of protests in various towns have led to a confrontation between protesters and the police, and a widespread disruption of day-to-day life in the state. The trigger for the present discontent was the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib, which led to demonstrations in the area. Aggressive police action against the protesters left two people dead and many injured. Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has sought to calm the tempers by appealing for forbearance and by suspending a senior police officer, but this has only had a limited effect. Much of the recent discontent can be traced to the feeling that the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has not provided the leadership it was expected to in Sikh matters, that it has not upheld the interest of the followers of the faith. Not only that, even Akal Takht found such widespread resentment against its decision to grant pardon to the Dera Sacha Sauda chief that it was compelled to take a U-turn and withdraw the pardon. The relationship between the Shiromani Akali Dal and the SGPC is a symbiotic one. Over the years, such has been the SGPC’s importance that most senior SAD leaders trace their rise to their association with this ‘mini-parliament of Sikhs’. The Shiromani Akali Dal is a political party which fights elections, for which, like any other party, it needs to make various electoral compromises. There is a delicate balance that has been successfully maintained for decades between temporal matters and mundane politics. This can be a volatile mix if there is any perception of this equilibrium being disturbed, as has happened recently. An imbalance can lead to distressing lack of trust and a feeling of disenchantment among ordinary Sikhs. Even as the Chief Minister addresses law and order issues on priority, he and his party need to take a deep look at the relationship between the SAD and the Sikh religious organisations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:01:58.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
