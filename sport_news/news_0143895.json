Who opens the batting could be a consequence of that. I’m sure both those boys will get an opportunity.” \nRashid is vying for a spot in the first XI after ending a six-year absence from ODIs to produce some consistent bowling against Australia and New Zealand this year. \n“I’m only one of two or three selectors, but my view is that he’ll play at some stage on this tour,” said Bayliss. \nPakistan have never lost a series in the UAE and will again play in their adopted home, while England have two warm-up games ahead of the first test in Abu Dhabi on Oct. 13. \n(Reporting by Matt Smith, editing by Pritha Sarkar) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
