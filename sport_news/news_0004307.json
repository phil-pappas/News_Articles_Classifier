The father of three is president of Haverford's football booster club and often spends evenings watching film of the Fords' next opponent. \n\"Yeah, he's pretty involved,\" Billy Farrell said. \"It's almost like he's another coach. And, as a family, football is usually the subject of conversation.\" \nBill Farrell, a mortgage consultant, played football, basketball, and lacrosse at Haverford. He concentrated on lacrosse at West Chester. \nBilly Farrell, 17, and Jack Farrell, 16, are also teammates in lacrosse. Following directly in the footsteps of his father, Jack's third sport is basketball. \nThe boys' uncle, Joe Farrell, was a member of the 1980 Haverford squad that claimed a Central League football crown. Their cousin, Kevin Leyden, shined in football, ice hockey, and lacrosse at the school from 2010 to 2014. \nIn football, the Farrell brothers are trying to help the Fords earn their first Central League title since 1995. Last year's squad went 8-4 overall, 7-2 in the league, and gained a berth in the PIAA District 1 Class AAAA playoffs. \nAfter being dealt a 41-3 loss by Downingtown West in this season's opener, Haverford has won four straight. Next up is a Central League showdown vs. Garnet Valley (4-1, 3-0) on Friday night at A.G. Cornog Field. \n\"This game is huge for us,\" Billy Farrell said. \"We've been talking about it for a long time, especially after what happened against them last year.\" \nIn Week 9 last season, Garnet Valley scored with 29 seconds remaining to eke out a 44-41, come-from-behind win. The Jaguars were aided by a controversial call in the late going. \n\"We thought it was a bad call, but you can never blame the refs for a loss,\" Jack Farrell said. \"Our defense wasn't able to come up with a stop at the end. We've got to find a way to get it done this time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:52:10.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
