Photo: mlb.com\nTwo commentators at a Major League Baseball game in the US have spoken out on behalf of the pre-mobile phone generation, hilariously confessing their consternation at a group of young women more intent on grabbing the perfect selfie than watching an enthralling contest on the field.\nWith the Colorado Rockies leading the Arizona Diamondbacks 1-0 at the bottom of the fourth it was, as one of the commentators put it, \"selfie time\", at which point the ladies showed what any public transport passenger already knows: that people are obsessed with their handsets.\nAmid snaps of funny faces, the girls' meals and, well, their meals and funny faces, the group missed a pretty crucial base hit by Diamondbacks' left fielder David Peralta. It obviously didn't bother them.\n\"Look at the one on the right,\" one of the sportscasters says.\nAdvertisement \"Do you have to make faces when you take selfies?\" the other responds.\n\"One more now. Better angle. Check it. Did that come out OK?\"\n\"That's one of the 300 pictures I've taken of myself today!\"\nThe interplay continues.\n\"Every girl in the picture is locked into her phone,\" one says. \"Welcome to parenting in 2015. They're all just completely transfixed by the technology.\"\nIf they missed it live, the group could have texted each other the final score, which was 3-1 to Arizona.\nIn all fairness to those girls, I'd be doing the same thing at a Diamondbacks/Rockies game too.\nâ€” Troy (@MacksPower) October 1, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MacksPower/status/649717886689214464"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:29:56.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
