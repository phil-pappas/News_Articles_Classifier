The shocking incident happened in Drogheda Garda Station on Tuesday and led officers to remove the book from the station's public area.\nMourners follow the remains of slain Garda Tony Golden as he made his final journey this week Last night, sources said that rank-and-file gardai are \"shocked\" at the perpetrator's actions.\n\"What he did was a vile act, what he wrote was completely out of order,\" the source said.\n\"It seems that he has a major problem with gardai but the abusive language that he used is a complete affront, not just to Garda Tony Golden, but every garda.\"\nThe suspect, who is aged in his 20s, is from the Moneymore estate in Drogheda and is known to gardai. Sources say that his actions could lead to criminal damage offence charges.\nGarda Tony Golden (36) was given a hero's State funeral yesterday, where thousands of gardai lined the streets of Blackrock, Co Louth.\nMeanwhile, garda killer Adrian Crevan Mackin (24) was cremated after a secret funeral in Belfast yesterday morning attended by just a handful of acquaintances.\nAn undertaker from his home town of Newry finally agreed to do the job after being contacted by friends of Mackin's, when it emerged that he had effectively been disowned by members of his family.\nIn stark contrast to the State funeral for Garda Tony Golden on Thursday, when thousands of mourners thronged the village of Blackrock to pay their respects to the father-of-three, Mackin's remains were discreetly driven to Roselawn crematorium in South Belfast for a quick funeral service and cremation at 10.30am yesterday.\nAccording to a source, the service was \"quick, clinical and impersonal\".\n\"A half-hour slot was booked but it didn't take that long. A priest said a few prayers and then he was cremated. Only around two dozen people turned up, if that. He has been shunned by everyone who knew him,\" the source added.\nUndertaker\nMackin's remains lay unclaimed in a hospital morgue as attempts were made to find an undertaker to collect them this week. A number of funeral directors initially refused to handle the remains of the young thug, who was facing terrorism charges before his shooting spree.\nMr Mackin's ex-partner, Siobhan Phillips, is clinging for life in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:11:39.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
