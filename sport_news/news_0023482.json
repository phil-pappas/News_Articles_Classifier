None of this seems even vaguely familiar. What the heck is this, a Goth convention?\nAnd then again, “real” has always been a bit of a misnomer to tack on this No. 1 Ohio State squad. It has been defined by a first-ever unanimous No. 1 pick in the Associated Press preseason poll, which was based on a strong returning cast from last year’s impressive three-game run at the end of the season and the resulting national championship.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \nIt has been hard to conceive that the “real” Buckeyes would struggle the way they did against Northern Illinois, Indiana and Maryland, or even that they wouldn’t have put the pedal to the metal a little more in victories over Virginia Tech, Hawaii and Western Michigan.\nPenn State offered a chance for the Ohio State team everybody has been waiting on to make a dramatic entrance on a national stage last night, even if a random TV viewer at first might have mistaken the team in black and red for those Red Wolves of Arkansas State.\nAfter the Nittany Lions lost to Temple in their season opener, they were seen as just another domino to flick on the way to a Nov. 21 meeting with No. 7 Michigan State. But the Buckeyes’ slog through the schedule and Penn State’s five straight wins presented OSU a chance to finally look like a No. 1 team against a respected opponent.\nThe Buckeyes eventually did that in a 38-10 win, although a slow start on offense that finally resulted in backup J.T. Barrett supplanting Cardale Jones at quarterback offered further proof that this year’s squad and last year’s late-season team are two different, uh, juggernauts.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nJones led the Buckeyes on that late-season run after both Braxton Miller and Barrett were hurt, and he won the job in part because of that. But his struggles led coach Urban Meyer to use Barrett last week in the red zone, and this week they eventually led him to use Barrett all over the field.\nJones was 9 of 15 for 84 yards. He was sacked twice and missed a few open receivers.\n“The job is to go win a game and we won, we beat a very good team by 28 points,” Meyer said. “No turnovers, that’s two games in a row. And we’re six for six in the red zone. I’m extremely pleased with this.”\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \nMeyer obviously wasn’t pleased with what he called Jones’ “misfires” in the passing game. But Miller caught four passes for 33 yards and a touchdown and ran four times for 35 yards, more the kind of production that was expected from him and the three-headed quarterback monster that caused some to believe this OSU team might be even better than last year’s model.\nBut so far that hasn’t been the case, and seven games into the season, the coaches are still trying to figure out the best way to use them all.\n“(Ezekiel Elliott) and the offensive line took control of the game,” Meyer said, “and I thought J.T .came in and played great. He ran for 100 yards, and he obviously gives you that dual threat when you’re bogged down a little bit. He did a great job.”\nThings change. Every team is different, even if many of the same players are back. These Buckeyes may end up being every better than last year’s Buckeyes, and then again, maybe those befuddling Buckeyes who have struggled against lesser opponent are the real ones.\nThis was a good win, but the games that will likely define this team — Michigan State, Michigan, a possible Big Ten title game and bowl game(s) — have yet to played.\nIn the meantime, it’s doesn’t seem unreasonable to engage in a little self-evaluation:\nHow many games have to be played before we realize that our preconceived notions about a team might be wrong?\nBob Hunter is a sports columnist for The Dispatch. \nbhunter@dispatch.com \n@dailyhunter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:56.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
