Kah-thunk! Kah-thunk!\nThe sound echoed through downtown Detroit on Wednesday afternoon, as a machine kept pounding to a steady beat, a strange heartbeat of construction. This is the sound of progress in the Motor City.\nA throng of workers wearing neon yellow vests and white helmets were busy remaking Detroit. Some were transforming Woodward, laying the M-1 RAIL System. Others were down in a giant hole, where the new Red Wings arena is being built. Right now, it looks like a giant erector set with a muddy floor.\n\"They throwin' down, ain't they?\" a man said, while ambling down the sidewalk, trying to glance through the chain-link fence.\nThrowin' down, indeed.\nThis is a city on the rebound. Restaurants are popping up everywhere you turn, and retail stores are opening up. And it's all tied back to sports.\n\"Absolutely,\" said Dave Bing, the former Piston and former mayor of Detroit, who was one of several speakers on Wednesday at \"Detroit Homecoming,\" a gathering of 175 expatriates who have come back to the city. \"When you get 60,000 or 80,000 people coming downtown at the same time, they have to park. They have to eat. Not a lot of people understand economic impact, but it's so important.\"\nThe event has brought together more than 300 movers and shakers, everybody from Dan Gilbert to Gov. Rick Snyder, and the theme is the power of sports in the Detroit economy.\n\"Detroit is the greatest sports city in the country,\" Snyder said, kicking off the event. \"There's no doubt about it.\"\nDealing with doubt\nThere was a time when I wondered if Detroit could ever come back.\nFifteen years ago, I spent an entire school year in an elementary classroom, writing about Miss Ratliff's room to highlight the problems in the Detroit Public Schools. I found dedicated teachers working in a system that was a mess. Test scores were abysmal, illiteracy was rampant and parent participation was almost nonexistent. Kids walked past burned-out buildings and abandoned cars on the way to school. And teachers had to buy their own supplies, even toilet paper for their students.\nIt was depressing. If the schools were such a mess, how could this city ever rise again? At the time, Comerica Park was being built, and I was conflicted. Why would this city or state chip in any money to help fund a baseball stadium when the schools were in such rough shape? It didn't make sense to me.\nEleven years ago, I spent several months embedded with the homicide unit at the Detroit Police Department. I traveled with detectives to countless murder scenes, crossing the yellow tape and stepping around dead bodies. On a summer day in 2004, I sat on a porch with a 62-year-old grandmother. The night before, her porch had turned into a murder scene. So she woke up early to scrub away the blood of a stranger. Not far away, on that same morning, thousands were gathering to celebrate the Pistons' 2004 world championship.\nBack then, I couldn't come to grips with both of those worlds — the fancy world of professional sports and the reality just a few miles away.\nUnifying force\nMore than three years ago, I became a sports columnist, and it has given me a different view of this great city. It has given me a different perspective on the importance of sports.\nI have seen this city come alive on Tigers Opening Day, the unofficial holiday in the Motor City.\nI have walked to Joe Louis Arena with thousands of fans wearing their Wings jerseys.\nAnd I have walked through empty parking lots that came alive with Lions fans.\nOur sports teams pull everything together — city and suburbs, all races and religions. Sports is the heartbeat of this city; it is our source of pride and fascination. And every day, I find a new reason why this city will survive. Every day, I find a new reason for hope.\nLast Sunday night, I walked around Ford Field before the Lions played on national television. Bars and restaurants were packed. The streets were alive.\nThings aren't perfect. Work still needs to be done with the schools and the neighborhoods. But this city lives on. It's coming back. There is a vibe in Detroit. Never give up. Keep fighting. Transform. Adapt. There is a positive energy in Detroit right now.\n\"I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly,\" said Al Kaline, a former Tiger, one of the speakers.\nBut he has seen the changes. It's hard to miss. \"We will become, over the next few years, one of the greatest cities in the United States,\" Kaline told the group.\nYou can feel it. And you can hear it echoing through the city.\nContact Jeff Seidel: jseidel@freepress.com.
