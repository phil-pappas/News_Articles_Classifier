But if this season's four-team event were to be seeded today, the Big 12 might account for half the field.\nThe 13-person panel that votes in the Football Four Playoff Projection seeded TCU second and Baylor fourth in its latest projection released today. Those two programs finished sixth and fifth, respectively, in the inaugural seeding by the Playoff selection committee last December.\nUtah, with a résumé that seems to strengthen with every win by the Utes and its Week 1 opponent Michigan, moved up three spots into the top seed this week, and last week's top seed Ohio State slipped to the No. 3 seed after a narrow escape Saturday at Indiana.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. Each panelist enters a four-team ballot, with four points awarded for a No. 1 vote, three for a No. 2, two for a No. 3 and one for a No. 4.\nUtah earned 29 voting points for the top seed, TCU earned 24, Ohio State earned 23 and Baylor had 18. Utah's point total is the lowest for a No. 1 seed in the two-plus years of the projection, and all four of the seeds received at least two first-place votes. The fact that eight teams received a second-place vote reflects the unusually wide-open nature of this year's Playoff chase.\nPanelist Rich Brooks said he sees the Big 12 as the conference most likely to have an unbeaten team entering the Playoff, and fellow voter Jim Ross says that's key for the league. \"The Big 12 winner likely has to run the table to squeeze into the final four,\" Ross said. \"The sense of urgency is palpable in the Big 12 with no title game.\"\nThe Playoff Projection is in its third year. Its panel is based on the College Football Playoff selection committee's model and includes the former FBS coach Brooks and WWE Hall of Famer Ross, plus former FBS coaches Tommy Bowden and Jim Grobe, former FBS athletic directors Bill Byrne and Jim Livengood, Michigan State men's basketball coach and football aficionado Tom Izzo and USA TODAY Sports college sports staff members Nicole Auerbach, Paul Myerberg, George Schroeder, Eddie Timanus, Daniel Uthman and Dan Wolken.\nThe projection is purely a mock selection with no bearing on the Playoff selection committee's decisions.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST SEC Whip Around: Florida looks to keep rolling | 02:53 Reporters from around the nation preview Week 6 in the SEC.\n1 of 11 COLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST Week 5 Campus Conclusions: Season is a fantastic mess | 02:08 USA TODAY Sports' George Schroeder looks at lessons learned from Week 5 of the college football season.\n2 of 11 COLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST Week 5 Amway Coaches Poll: Florida becoming a factor | 01:38 USA TODAY Sports' George Schroeder reveals the Week 5 Amway College Football Coaches Poll.\n3 of 11 COLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST Bold predictions for Week 5 of college football | 02:19 USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken gives some predictions you'd never expect for Week 5 of the college football season.\n4 of 11 COLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST Fan Index presented by Goodyear: Best Tailgates | 02:21 We traveled around the country to find the best tailgating scene in college football and elnlisted the help of the World Tetris champion to help you pack your truck efficiently.
