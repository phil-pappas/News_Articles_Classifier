By NATHAN DEEN NATHAN.DEEN@SAVANNAHNOW.COM STATESBORO — It was more like the kind of display Georgia Southern coach Willie Fritz wants to see from his offense — a marriage of balance and quick-strike ability.\nCouple that with a solid defensive effort, and it was a happy homecoming for the Eagles as they rolled to a 56-26 win over New Mexico State at Paulson Stadium.\nGeorgia Southern ran for 507 yards, five different Eagles had rushing touchdowns, and six of Southern’s eight TDs were on plays of 19 yards or more.\nThe Eagles even connected on a touchdown pass for the first time this season.\n“We spread the wealth around,” Fritz said. “A bunch of guys got to touch it. It was good to play a lot of guys. We finished drives tonight more so than a couple of weeks ago.”\nAs they did against Louisiana-Monroe two weeks ago, the Eagles (5-1, 3-0) got things going with a blocked punt, then cashed in two plays later as Wesley Fields bounced outside the tackles and found a seam on the right side on his way to the end zone for a 19-yard score.\nBy halftime, GSU’s top four rushers had scored a touchdown. None of that deterred from Matt Breida putting up his usual numbers, however.\nBreida got his on the next GSU drive. It was a 20-yard touchdown that looked similar to the score by Fields.\nA 55-yard run in the third quarter that didn’t go for a score allowed Breida to boast a 10.5 yards-per-carry average, which is right around his season average of 10.3 that leads the FBS. He finished with 143 yards on 13 carries and the TD.\nKevin Ellison turned the game into a rout early in the second quarter when he kept on the option and cut up field before finding more running room near the sideline. The play would have been stopped short of the end zone had it not been for Breida, who caught up to Ellison in a sprint and threw a block on the only Aggie defender that had a shot of stopping the play.\n“I saw Kevin just cut it up,” Breida said about the play. “Sometimes Kevin will get caught at the 1, so I was like, he’s got to score this time. I just wanted to get down there and ran as fast as I could and just threw a great block at the end for him. I had to run pretty fast. Kevin’s not that slow of a guy.”\nAfter a 23-yard touchdown run by LA Ramsby, Ellison hit Wesley Fields coming out of the backfield on a swing pass, and Fields turned up field, got some blocks and took it for a 60-yard score. The ball had to be thrown a little high as an Aggie defender was closing on the play, but Fields went up and grabbed it and quickly got into open space.\n“I just went up and attacked the ball and took it from there,” Fields said.\nIn the second half, backup quarterback Favian Upshaw got in on the action and ran for two touchdowns, including a 29-yarder that gave the Eagles their biggest lead of the game at 56-14. He finished with 53 yards on six carries to go with the scores, Ellison had six carries for 104 yards, and Ramsby had 85 yards on 11 carries.\n“I know it’s hard for a defensive coordinator,” Fields said. “We’ve got so many weapons on offense. It’s good to have more than just one guy carrying the load.”\nThe Aggies are still winless this season at 0-6, 0-2 in the Sun Belt. They were playing without starting quarterback Tyler Rogers, who is out with a thumb injury. Backup Andrew Allen played the entire game, completing 20 of 37 passes for 253 yards and three touchdowns with an interception.\nIt was just the kind of win the Eagles needed coming off a bye week and right before a Thursday night showdown at rival Appalachian State. Not only will that game give the winner the inside track to a Sun Belt title, both teams are also playing for bowl eligibility for the first time in the programs’ histories.\n“It means a tremendous amount,” Breida said. “We just have to go out this week to practice and bring it hard.”\nIt was a matchup between the team with the longest Sun Belt Conference losing streak and the one with longest winning streak. The Aggies also own the longest losing streak in the FBS at 15 games. They went winless in the conference, while the Eagles haven’t lost to a conference foe since they joined the league.\nNew Mexico St. 0 7 7 12 — 26\nGa Southern 14 21 14 7 — 56\nFirst Quarter\nGaSo_W.Fields 19 run (Hanks kick), 7:23.\nGaSo_Breida 20 run (Hanks kick), 3:23.\nSecond Quarter\nGaSo_K.Ellison 67 run (Hanks kick), 10:18.\nGaSo_Ramsby 23 run (Hanks kick), 5:18.\nNMSU_Bergstrom 3 pass from A.Allen (Davidson kick), 3:53.\nGaSo_W.Fields 60 pass from K.Ellison (Hanks kick), 2:35.\nThird Quarter\nNMSU_Bowen 3 pass from A.Allen (Davidson kick), 8:19.\nGaSo_Ramsby 5 run (Hanks kick), 6:18.\nGaSo_Upshaw 5 run (Hanks kick), 5:20.\nFourth Quarter\nGaSo_Upshaw 29 run (Hanks kick), 13:47.\nNMSU_Bowen 8 pass from A.Allen (kick failed), 11:30.\nNMSU_Clement 74 fumble return (pass failed), 6:43.\nA_23,551.\nNMSU GaSo\nFirst downs 19 24\nRushes-yards 29-133 59-507\nPassing 253 85\nComp-Att-Int 20-37-1 4-8-0\nReturn Yards 4 44\nPunts-Avg. 5-30.8 3-47.0\nFumbles-Lost 1-0 2-1\nPenalties-Yards 4-40 7-86\nTime of Possession 25:36 34:24\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING_New Mexico St., Rose III 13-82, Hall 6-29, A.Allen 9-18,\nMorgan 1-4.
