The quality of the contest in the opener, though, must have eased the furrows a bit on the foreheads of the purists. The breathtaking contest saw a superb century from Rohit Sharma upstaged by two brilliant half-centuries from AB de Villliers (51 off 31 balls) and JP Duminy (unbeaten 68 off just 34 balls), and South Africa pulling off a miraculous seven-wicket win with just two balls remaining. When Rohit rocked the South Africans with a blinding hundred (106 off 66 balls) and India posted a mammoth 199-run total, South Africa looked down and out of the contest. For the visitors to even make a match of it, a spectacular effort was needed. That effort came in the form of the above-mentioned two-half centuries and the two stunning partnerships — the 77-run opening-wicket stand between Hashim Amla and de Villiers, and then the match-winning 105-run stand off just 55 balls between Duminy and F Behardien (32 not out). It looked all but over for the South Africans when AB de Villiers was bowled by R Ashwin, followed by the quick dismissal of skipper Faf du Plessis, with still over 100 runs left to get in less than ten overs. But then that match-winning partnership happened, and India helplessly saw the match they were in control of slipping from. Earlier, the Indian innings was all about Rohit Sharma’s superlative knock, though it didn’t look particularly promising at the start. He looked a little clueless in the first over bowled by Kyle Abbott, survived a close lbw call, and then a caught and bowled chance. But once he was done with the initial jitters, there was just no stopping him. While South Africa’s impressive looking four-pronged pace attack kept Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli quiet at the start of their innings, Sharma took a boundary off them in almost every over. He relied more on his drives and pulls to begin with; in the forties, he grew more adventurous and played some exquisite strokes on either side, behind the wicket. And once he crossed 50, in 39 balls, he launched a no-holds-barred attack on the visitors. While the pacers were leaking runs in a torrent, Imran Tahir, the leg-spinner, had managed to exert some sort of control over him and Kohli. But in the innings’ 12th over, Sharma swung him over mid-wicket for a massive six, thus breaking the shackles, and giving himself and the other batsmen a free run against the now totally demoralised attack. At the other end, Kohli, too, shifted gears and the South Africans came under the double-barrelled attack, from which there was no escape. And soon enough, Sharma reached his maiden T20I hundred, bringing it up with a straight six off Merchant de Lange. He’s just the second Indian after Suresh Raina to score a ton in the shortest format. Before he fell off a miscued pull off Abbott for 106, he had demolished each and every bowler, registering a 100-plus strike rate against each of them. While everyone had their eyes firmly focussed on him, Kohli became the first Indian batsman to accumulate 1000 runs in T20Is. The amazing part of the feat is that he has gathered these runs at an incredible average of 46.26, which is more than respectable even in Tests. On Friday, he again had a good knock, scoring 43 off 27 balls. Sharma’s knock meant that the following batsmen just had to play normal cricket to take India to a daunting total. MS Dhoni and Raina did just that and India had a challenging total of 199 runs on the board. In the end, however, this massive total too proved inadequate. 2 Indians — Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina — have hit T20I hundred.
