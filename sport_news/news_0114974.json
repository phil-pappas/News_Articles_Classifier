By comparison, 6 in 10 say the same for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who, like Trump, has tapped into the powerful wave of antiestablishment anger defining the early phases of the 2016 contest.\n\"It's the lifelong establishment politicians on both sides that rub me the wrong way,\" said registered Republican Joe Selig, a 60-year-old carpenter from Vallejo, Calif. \"I think Trump is more electable. He's strong. We need strength these days.\"\nTrump and Carson are considered among the least electable general election candidates by the Republican Party's professionals, those who are in the business of helping candidates run campaigns and win elections.\nExperienced political strategists note that winning a general election and winning the Republican nomination are often very different tasks. The GOP's most conservative voters — a group that is older and whiter than the nation as a whole — wield extraordinary influence in picking the nominee. Independents, moderate voters and minorities are far more important in general elections that draw many more people to the polls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:04:37.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
