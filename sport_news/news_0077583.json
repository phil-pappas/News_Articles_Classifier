Powell was run over during a kickoff. And with top kicker Austin Hardin also dealing with a leg injury, coach Jim McElwain has few, if any, other options on his roster. \nSo Florida took to Twitter \"looking for walk-on kickers.\" The team asked for any interested and eligible students to visit the football office by 4:30 p.m. Monday for a tryout. \nThe good news for the Gators (6-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) is they are off this week before playing rival Georgia (5-2, 3-2) in Jacksonville on Halloween. So they have extra time to get healthy or get a walk-on up to speed. \nAP college football website: http://www.collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:07:43.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
