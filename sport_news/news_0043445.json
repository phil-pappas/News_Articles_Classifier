While the girls registered a stunning 67-54 victory over Uttar Pradesh, who had finished third last year, the boys thrashed Kerala 90-73 to book a spot in the last-four here today. The Punjab girls, after opening up a comfortable 20-11 lead in the first quarter, lost some steam in the second and third as UP caught up with them and then went ahead to lead 43-42 at the start of the last quarter. In the decider, however, the local girls got their act together to get the better of their more fancied opponent. In the boys' category, the hosts and Kerala were neck and neck until the end of the third quarter. The Punjab boys, however, put up a fine performance in the last quarter to notch up comprehensive win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:25:21.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
