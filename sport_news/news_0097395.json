His face adorns practically every photo montage in and around Barclays Center to trumpet the Islanders’ arrival this season.\nIn one prominent string of oversized entertainment and sporting celebrity pics leading to one of the arena entrances, John Tavares’ image even is adjacent to that of one of Brooklyn’s most revered legends — songstress and actress Barbra Streisand.\nStill, the star center and two-time finalist for the NHL’s Hart Trophy for league MVP isn’t exactly a bold-faced or household name just yet throughout the part-hipster, part-Fuhgeddaboutit borough.\n“I’m not worried about anything like that, I really just want to win, and as I’ve found, the rest of that takes care of itself, whether that’s what you’re looking for or not,” Tavares told the Daily News earlier this week. “From my standpoint, I think the only way to really achieve that sort of widespread recognition and earn that respect is for us to win as a team.\n“I’m a really big sports fan, in general, and you see how guys like (Derek) Jeter, (Mark) Messier, Eli (Manning), all of the guys from the Islanders dynasty, are thought about in New York by their fans, and that’s because they did things the right way and they delivered championships. These guys all are or were great players in terms of their personal achievements. But winning, especially here, that tops everything. And truthfully, that’s the only thing that I want to do.”\nEntering his seventh NHL season at 25, Tavares actually has appeared in just two playoff series with the Islanders — opening-round losses to Pittsburgh in 2013 and to Washington last spring. The once-dominant franchise hasn’t won a single postseason series, in fact, since 1993.\nDoug Weight, the former teammate and current Isles assistant coach who allowed Tavares and then-teammate Matt Moulson to live in his family’s guest house on Long Island during his first few seasons in the NHL, believes No. 91 has watched Canadian hockey contemporaries Sidney Crosby of Pittsburgh and Jonathan Toews of Chicago hoist the Stanley Cup and uses “everything he sees about guys winning in hockey and the other sports” as pure motivation to reach the top.\n“He may say all of this stuff doesn’t matter to him, but it certainly motivates him,” Weight said. “He knows where he is. He knows he’s in New York, whether it’s Long Island or Brooklyn. He knows he also desperately wants to build something here like Chicago has done, with their three Cups in six years.\n“He knows what that would do for his status as a player and for his legacy. Don’t get me wrong, it’s team-first 100% with him, but guys are definitely driven by what their legacy means. Sidney, Toews, John…These guys realize that and he realizes what’s at stake and what comes with it, for sure.\n“But he understands that the gravy doesn’t precede the boat, that’s for sure,” Weight continued. “John knows what he wants to do and what he has to do to get there and how great it’s going to feel to work that hard and get to where he’s wanted to get to his whole life. All the other stuff will come with it. But you’re lying to everyone if you say it doesn’t matter. It does.”\nBruce Bennett/Getty Images Seeing peers Jonathan Toews and Sidney Crosby raise the Stanley Cup has served as motivation for John Tavares.

He doesn’t just go out in a game and all of a sudden be good. It starts in the summertime, it starts in practice. Usually when your best player is your hardest working guy, it translates. But he’ll tell you the same thing, he’s always working on something in his game, whether it was his skating one year, his shot one year, he’s always working.”\nAdded Tavares: “I’ve never accepted anything I’ve accomplished personally, and honestly the biggest motivation is knowing that my getting better at all these different parts of the game is hopefully going to help push us one day to win in the playoffs and to win the Stanley Cup.”\nWeight says he noticed that competitiveness, work ethic and drive immediately when Tavares essentially moved in with his veteran teammate’s family soon after being selected No.1 overall by the Isles in 2009 after smashing Wayne Gretzky’s goal-scoring records in the Ontario Hockey League — whether it was by his incessant questions about the NHL or simply playing video games or sports with Weight’s children.\nBut Weight quickly noticed something else telling about Tavares, who he believes has appeared increasingly comfortable in recent seasons with the leadership role thrust upon him once he was named captain in 2013.\n“I think at the beginning, he thought maybe he had to change for everyone. He worried a little bit about it, because he was a little more serious and quiet,” said Weight, a 1,000-point NHL scorer who began his career with the Rangers. “We all — my wife and my kids and all the guys in the room — we chopped that away a little bit the last few years.\n“Johnny’s really a lighthearted guy and he wants to enjoy himself, but when we get here, he expects everyone to have the same devotion to working hard in practice and winning and having the same goals that he does. I think that’s a great way to start for any organization, to have somebody that not only is your best player, but leads by fierce practice habits and the highest goals who expects the most out of himself. To me, he’s already a star in every sense of the word and we’re very lucky to have him. But it shouldn’t be too long before everyone else knows that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:10:11.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
