You’ve seen the commercials. And seen them. And seen them. And seen them again. You know the ones, where guys say they invested 35 cents in their fantasy draft and won $350 million. How quickly times, and fortunes, change. Wasn’t it only last year when those same guys, judging by the commercials shown during NFL games, fantasized about women? When every other ad was for a little blue pill? In any event, those days are gone. Whether you think that’s for better, or for worse, probably depends on how your Fantasy Football team did last weekend — how many touchdown passes your quarterback threw, how many yards your top running back racked up, how many field goals your kicker (my sympathies if you had Josh Scobee) booted through the uprights. Hopefully, you’ve done a better job of putting together your Fantasy Football team than Ben Cherington did with the Red Sox. Which, sad to say, shouldn’t have been all that hard. But now you have something of greater concern to worry about. Now, NFL players have been granted permission to put together their own Fantasy Football teams. According to league policy, “Fantasy football games ... for prizes generally are not considered to be gambling or a gambling-related activity, provided that there is no wagering on the outcome. NFL personnel may not, however, accept prizes with a value in excess of $250 in any fantasy football game. This prohibition is intended to avoid any appearance of impropriety which may result from participation in fantasy football games by individuals perceived to have an unfair advantage due to their preferential access to information.” How the NFL can rationalize Fantasy Football as a non-gambling activity is the subject for another article. But, knowing how concerned commissioner Roger Goodell is about the integrity of the game, it is not the “preferential access” that should have him worried, but the potential for preferential treatment. Allow me to take you into the Patriots huddle, with the Pats deep in the red zone and set to score: Tom Brady: “I’m going to throw to Gronk on this one.” Julian Edelman: “C’mon, man. You always throw to Gronk when we’re near the goal line.” Danny Amendola: “Yeah, what’s up with that? How come Jules and I never get to score touchdowns?” Brady: “That’s easy guys — Gronk’s on my Fantasy Football team.” I can see this sort of thing happening in every huddle around the league this season. Page 2 of 2 - It may even have been going on for a while. I can’t prove this, but I’ve got to believe that, last year, Seattle coach Pete Carroll had Ricardo Lockette on his Fantasy team — got him for a lot less money than Jermaine Kearse would have cost — and so had Russell Wilson throw to him in the closing seconds of Super Bowl XLIX. How else do you explain Marshawn Lynch, who almost bulled his way into the end zone on the previous play, not getting the ball on the goal line? What if offensive coordinators, such as the Patriots’ Josh McDaniels, have Fantasy teams? Bill Belichick: \"Hey, Josh, we’re on the one-yard line. Why are you taking out LeGarrette Blount and sending in Brandon Bolden to carry the ball?\" McDaniels: \"Don’t you remember? I added Brandon to my Fantasy roster this week.\" Belichick: \"It is what it is.\" That’s the way it is in the NFL these days, now that Fantasy Football is king, and not just fans, but players and coaches, too, will be dueling for points.
