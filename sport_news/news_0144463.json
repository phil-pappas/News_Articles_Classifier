AP 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story ROCK HILL \nAs landfall by Hurricane Joaquin became less likely Friday morning, a flash flood watch remained in effect for York, Chester and Lancaster counties, and emergency officials continued preparing for heavy rain and possible flooding over the weekend. \nFriday’s weather in Rock Hill and the surrounding area was cool, with scattered light showers. \nBut much of the area can expect 4 to 6 inches of rain over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service, with a half-inch to three quarters of an inch possible Friday and 2 to 3 inches possible Friday night. Wind gusts Friday night could reach 25 mph. \nThe wind gusts and rain are expected to continue Saturday, with an additional 1.5 to 3 inches of rain possible, according to the weather service. \nSeveral events were canceled ahead of the heavy rains . \nThe wet weather is from a slowly moving upper level low-pressure system over the Southeast that will increasingly interact with tropical moisture headed this way. \nThat moisture is unrelated to Hurricane Joquain, which will remain too far offshore to impact the Charlotte area, National Weather Service meteorologist Trisha Palmer said Friday. The National Hurricane Center upgraded Joquain to a Category 4 storm Thursday afternoon. \nThe flash flood watch for the area is in effect through Monday morning. With the heaviest rainfall expected to begin Friday evening, emergency officials continued taking steps Friday to prepare for flooding, and urged residents to do the same. \nMike Channell, deputy emergency management director for York County, said Friday morning that they had a conference call Thursday with the S.C. Emergency Management Division that included emergency responders and incident management. \n“Right now, we’re just monitoring,” he said. “There’s so many uncertainties on the amounts we’re going to get, when we’re going to get it.” \nChannell said they’ve asked local law enforcement to keep an eye out for areas prone to flooding. Emergency crews will then assess the potential hazard before making decisions on road closures or evacuations. \n“We’re expecting a major rainfall event,” said Ed Darby, senior planner for Chester County’s emergency management office. “We’re expecting flooding in areas we haven’t seen flooding before.” \nDarby urged residents to make their own preparations for flooding or power outages. This includes getting necessary prescriptions filled in advance, having flashlights and extra batteries, a battery-operated radio, bottled water and keeping cellphones fully charged. \n“If they need to get out and do anything, do it today,” Darby said. “Try to stay off the road. If this heavy rain develops tonight and tomorrow, we advise people if they don’t have to go anywhere, just stay at home.” \nChester County officials have been in contact with the American Red Cross in the event they need to open shelters, Darby said. \nGov. Nikki Haley on Thursday declared a state of emergency in South Carolina in advance of Hurricane Joaquin. \nBy Thursday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said the storm was showing signs of turning eastward, diminishing the potential that it would make landfall on the Carolina coast on Sunday. It’s possible Joaquin won’t hit land until it reaches Long Island, N.Y., or southern New England, the hurricane center said. \nStill, a low pressure system in the western Carolinas mingling with rain bands from Joaquin would bring a strong flow of wet air off the Atlantic into the Carolinas, forecasters said. \nS.C. Department of Transportation Crews spent Thursday gathering and preparing debris-clearing equipment, including heavy equipment, chainsaws, and other items used to remove tree limbs and debris from roadways and bridges. Employees also readied equipment such as signs and barricades to be put in place on roads and bridges that could become washed out. \nDrivers are urged not to drive through any standing water they see on a roadway, and to contact local law enforcement or the S.C. Highway Patrol. \nThe Charlotte Observer contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:35:34.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
