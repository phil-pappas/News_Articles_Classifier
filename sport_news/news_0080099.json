Referee Steve Kozari had lost sight of the puck just before Patrick Kane tipped it through Henrik Lundqvist 's pad and into the back of the net.\nThe referee was on the way to blowing his whistle, which is usually enough to count as the somewhat unpopular “intent to blow” rule, in which the play is basically dead as soon as the ref decides to blow his whistle even if he doesn't get it off in time. It was a pretty quick whistle, but Kozari lost sight of the puck.\nHere's a look at the play in question:\n\nHere's the official statement from the NHL on the call :\nAt 19:00 of the third period in the Rangers/Blackhawks game, the referee closest to the net informed the Situation Room that he was in the process of blowing his whistle when the puck was under Henrik Lundqvis t 's pad and before the puck crossed the New York goal line. According to Rule 78.5, apparent goals shall be disallowed \" when the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if he had not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing his whistle. \" This is not a reviewable play therefore the referee's call on the ice stands - no goal Chicago. The reason Kozari had a decision to make at all was due to the fact that Lundqvist made a spectacular save on Jonathan Toews , who attempted to slip the puck between the Rangers netminder's legs. Somehow Lundqvist got the pad on it to prevent the puck from fully crossing the line. That's when Kane came zooming in to poke the puck through.\nThe Blackhawks had goaltender Corey Crawford pulled in favor of an extra attacker as they tried to tie the game while trailing 3-2. They were throwing pretty much everything they had at New York and thought they had at least extended the game with the would-be Kane goal.\nBy the letter of the rule, the NHL got this right. You can argue about the timing of the whistle from the referee, but Kozari was where he was supposed to be and made the only call he could based on where he was. It's a game of split-second decisions and this was merely one of them.\n\nPatrick Kane saw his would-be tying goal waved off in controversial fashion.
