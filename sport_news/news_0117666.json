Down 2-1 with less than two minutes remaining, the Herd scored twice to top the Waterloo Black Hawks 3-2 before 4,824 fans at the PREMIER Center. Chaz Switzer netted the game winner with just 26 seconds remaining to lift the Herd to their second straight victory. Ales Stezka was brilliant between the pipes, stopping 42 of 44 shots on the night, helping the Herd improve to 3-3-0 on the season. \nIt was a back-and-forth first period with both teams exchanging scoring opportunities, but the score remained scoreless much of the period. Waterloo (2-2-1) broke through at Ronnie Hein wristed a shot in the slot that was stopped by the right pad of Stampede goaltender Ales Stezka, but Nick Swaney swarmed in and knocked the puck from underneath his pads and into the back of the net to give Waterloo a 1-0 lead at the 17:02 mark. The Hawks would take that lead into the locker room, outshooting the Herd 13-7 in the period. \nThe intensity of the game picked up in the second period as both teams played with a lot more energy and a little more physical play. The Stampede were able to even the game on the second part of a 5-on-3 advantage against the league’s best penalty kill. With just seconds remaining on the advantage, Joe Maguire fired a shot from the left point that was deflected by Jack Becker to tie the game 1-1. Becker was able to get his stick down and tip the puck past Waterloo goaltender Cale Morris to bring the PREMIER Center crowd to their feet. Both teams continued the up tempo play, but neither would score as the Hawks outshot the Stampede 14-13 in the period and the teams skated into the locker room in a 1-1 tie. \nThe final three minutes of the third period was the most exciting three minutes of hockey this season. With the score still tied 1-1, the Black Hawks took a 2-1 lead with just under three minutes remaining when Ben Newhouse’s shot from the right point was deflected by Shane Bowers and sent perfectly into the upper right hand corner of the net to Black Hawks a 2-1 lead. Despite the deficit, the Herd wasted little time finding a way to tie the game and with the goaltender pulled found the back of the net with 1:09 remaining in regulation. Csanad Erdely sent a shot onto the net of Morris and a mad scramble in front of the net ensued with the puck popping loose to Parker Tuomie who jammed it in to tie the game and send all 4,824 fans into a frenzy. It appeared that the game would then be headed to overtime, but the Herd were determined to find a way to win in regulation and did just that with 26 seconds left. Collin Peters took the puck down the left wing and wristed a shot onto the net of Morris with the rebound to Daniel Warpecha who sent a perfect pass into the slot to Chaz Switzer who quickly riffled the puck past the left pad of Morris and into the back of the net for the eventual game winner. \nSioux Falls won the game despite being outshot 17-6 in the third period and 44-28 in the game. The Herd finished the night 1-for-3 on the power play while the Hawks were 0-for-1. \nThese two teams will battle again on Saturday night at the PREMIER Center at 7:05 PM. The first 1,000 fans through the doors will receive a free Stampede mini stick, compliments of Schoeneman’s. Doors open at 6 PM and tickets are available through the KELOLAND Box Office inside the PREMIER Center or any Ticketmaster location. \n\nCourtesy: Sioux Falls Stampede DISCLAIMER: The views of the author are not necessarily those of this station, its owners, officers, agents or employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:18:32.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
