When that happens, you encourage guys, you get guys excited, you try to get guys ready for the next challenge. I believe from my vantage point that's what he was doing. You have to have passion.\"\nOn Monday, Garrett tried to explain things in more detail.\n\"That was just a situation that oftentimes happens on a sideline where guys are trying to encourage and inspire other guys on their team. He was fired up and wanted to make sure that the special teams unit was going to get the job done. Sometimes those things happen.\n\"It wasn't exactly the right time and place as we're getting ready to go out on the field. We got that conveyed and communicated and we all moved on.\"\nSee the video and get more details about the incident here:\nDid Greg Hardy go too far in his sideline outburst Sunday?\nFull coverage: Giants 27, Cowboys 20\nGosselin: New QB Matt Cassel gives Cowboys what they want, but it comes at a price\nMoore: A once promising season continues to slip away for last-place Cowboys\nSturm: Time to panic?
