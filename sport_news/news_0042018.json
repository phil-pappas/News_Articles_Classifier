Here's our first entry: 10 of the most intriguing rookies from the 2015 draft class. \nThe first few games of every NBA season are a ton of fun — everything feels fresh, every team wants to make the playoffs, and fans are enthusiastic about their favorite rookies. \nLong-time viewers, however, have probably realized that rookies — even the very good ones — rarely have a truly positive impact on their team. Most first-year players need a lot of time to adjust to the speed and strength of NBA competition, and as a result, the learning curve can be extremely steep. \nStill, the flashes rookies show can often be enough for a bad team to build hope for the future, and with a fun group of young players ready to take the court, this year promises to be no exception. Here are 10 rookies not named Karl Anthony-Towns or D'Angelo Russell (about whom everyone is already excited) worth watching in the NBA's opening games. \n1. Mario Hezonja, Orlando Magic — The Magic desperately needed a small forward and even more desperately needed a wing willing to take, and capable of making, 3-pointers. Mario Hezonja is more than willing (his confidence level might be a little too high, considering his pre-draft comparisons to J.R. Smith), but is he going to be capable in his rookie season? The answer will play a big role in Orlando's push to break an Eastern Conference playoff drought that has lasted since Dwight Howard left the team. \nIt's also worth noting that Hezonja — almost certainly more than once — is going to try to dunk on someone he has no business trying to dunk on. The result might or might not end well for Hezonja, but either way, it's going to be incredibly vine-worthy. \n2. Bobby Portis, Chicago Bulls — Portis landed in a fantastic situation. He's relatively athletic, extremely long and has a motor that will make him a perfect fit next to Joakim Noah and the rest of Chicago's highly motivated roster. \nThe real reason to keep an eye on Chicago's rookie forward, however, is the nickname he gave himself last Thursday. Portis said no one has asked the rookie to control his enthusiasm: \"This is me, Crazy Eyes Portis. It's been a great three days.\" — Sam Smith (@SamSmithHoops) October 1, 2015 \nCRAZY EYES PORTIS. This will be spectacular. \n3. Frank Kaminsky, Charlotte Hornets — Kaminsky doesn't have the explosive athleticism or ridiculous upside of other members of the 2015 draft class, but presumably, the Hornets expect him to be useful right away. They took a pretty serious gamble on that fact — the Celtics reportedly offered a treasure trove of assets and picks in order to swap spots with Charlotte, presumably in pursuit of Justise Winslow, who fell to No. 10. Kaminsky comes in with the directive to not only be useful immediately, but also to be more valuable individually than Winslow or (reportedly) as many as four first-round picks. \nSo no pressure. \nSpeaking of Winslow... \n4. Justise Winslow, Miami Heat — Already considered one of the most NBA-ready prospects, Winslow finds himself in an ideal situation with Miami, where the Heat already have a playoff team in place and can afford to bring along the young wing slowly. The question is: Will he need the patience? Winslow is a strong, explosive young player who demonstrated an advanced level of defense and toughness in college last season, as well as an improving jump shot and an excellent IQ on the offensive end. If he breaks into the rotation early, he could be in the Rookie of the Year conversation by April. \n5. Rashad Vaughn, Milwaukee Bucks — Nobody is going to buy a Milwaukee Bucks ticket to see Rashad Vaughn, but the former UNLV wing is still a fascinating prospect. A sweet-shooting two-guard — born in 1996, for those of you who feel old and want to mourn the swiftness of passing time — Vaughn can score, and he brings an interesting wrinkle to Milwaukee's growing nucleus. While the Bucks have competent shooters in Khris Middleton and Jabari Parker (presumably, we didn't actually see enough of him last season to know for sure), Vaughn could bring some real help to the squad, particularly if Parker is a stretch-4. Regardless, it will be interesting to see what Milwaukee sees in him — draft-night prognosticators saw him as a bit of a stretch at No. 16, and how Vaughn responds to those evaluations will be well worth watching. \n6. Justin Anderson, Dallas Mavericks — One of the more intriguing risers from Summer League, Anderson looks like he might have been a real steal for Dallas. His jumper was smooth — one of the question marks entering the draft — and he was willing to try to elevate and dunk on anyone. Anderson was lauded for his defense before the draft, so if his offense is already a plus, he might get some serious minutes for a Mavericks team that will likely have to answer some uncomfortable questions about its future very early in the season. \n7. Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks — Highly touted, booed on Draft Night , cheered at Summer League and interrogated at every step along the way, Latvian teenager Kristaps Porzingis has already been given the entire New York Knicks experience. Where he goes from here remains to be seen, but with a butter-smooth 3-point shot and the length and mobility to be a rim protector in the NBA, he has the potential to be a real star... if the New York experience doesn't ruin him first. Either way, he's someone to watch closely. \n8. Willie Cauley-Stein, Sacramento Kings — Willie Cauley-Stein was intriguing before the draft. After Sacramento snapped him up with the sixth pick — essentially promising to play him alongside DeMarcus Cousins — he became must-watch TV. The Kings are a powder keg rolling toward an open fire with the volatile mix of players already in place, so how a somewhat enigmatic rookie fits in on top of that powder keg remains to be seen. Cauley-Stein is an incredible defender who has drawn comparisons to DeAndre Jordan as a rim protector, and pre-draft reports suggested that he might even have a little offensive touch as well. He's going to be a lot of fun, assuming the Kings don't explode around him. \n9. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Brooklyn Nets — The Nets don't have a lot to look forward to this season, but Rondae Hollis-Jefferson might be a rare exception. Projected by his peers as one of the best defenders in the rookie class, Hollis-Jefferson is athletic, long and aggressive, and he'll be able to switch onto just about anyone as a defender. Could he be a Draymond Green-type riser? The Nets certainly hope so — RHJ is essentially their only young prospect capable of becoming something more than a solid role player in the NBA. \n10. Emmanuel Mudiay, Denver Nuggets — The hot take machine surrounding Mudiay has already come full circle: After Summer League, NBA commenters expected him to be Rookie of the Year. After his first preseason game, many of those same commenters expect him to be a bust. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle — Mudiay is an absurdly talented 19-year-old getting his first taste of NBA action on a team that will give him as many reps as it can early on. Like the rest of the rookie class, he could be awesome, he could be good, he could be mediocre, or he he could be a bust. At this point, we have no idea... but like the rest of his peers, finding out is going to be a lot of fun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:09:49.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
