Just based on common sense, it’s hard to believe that Pitino didn’t know. \nPitino has publicly denied knowledge of these events, and he’s stated that he will not step down from his position. He also has the public support of his Athletic Director. There was more fallout today after Katina Powell making her appearance on The View. McGee resigned his current position at UMKC, and Pitino made an announcement stating that he was going to skip ACC Media Day. \nPitino will still send three of his players to ACC Media Day to face the media firestorm, but he himself doesn’t want to create a distraction from the main purpose of the event. \nHe does have a point, as Pitino, UL, Katina Powell and the sex scandal in general are overly dominating college basketball headlines this preseason. It’s more than just a national college hoops story now, it’s a top trending mainstream news story. \nSo embedded below is the YouTube video of Katina Powell, her daughters Lindsay and Rod-Ni, speaking out today on ABC’s “The View.” \nBelow you’ll find the entire transcript of the interview of Katina Powell and her daughters on The View \nPaula Faris: You know one of the biggest sex scandals in college basketball history is happening right now at the University of Louisville — allegations of strippers hired to dance and have sex with players and prospective recruits, at parties the women say were organized and paid for by former director of basketball operations, Andre McGee. Today, we’re talking to a mother and her daughters, who claim that, up until a year ago, they were escorts hired for these parties. So, everyone, please welcome, Katina Powell and her daughters, Lindsay and Rod Ni. \nAll right, ladies thank you so much for coming. Katina, I want to ask you, I think the big question everyone asks right now, is why? What is your motivating factor? You blew the whistle on what was going on. You kept logs on what was going on. So, what were the intentions, your intentions of releasing this information now and writing a book about it. \nKatina Powell: Well, first off, I called the NCAA and I tried to tell them my story. I was asking them, what should I do? Who should I go to and talk to? They wouldn’t give me any assistance. They didn’t want to talk, they didn’t want to hear about a college basketball team. I decided to Google a publishing company and write a book. \nPF: You contacted the NCAA and they did nothing about it. \nKatina Powell: They did nothing about it. \nPF: What did you want to tell them? Everyone was of legal age and willing parties. What did you want to report? \nKP: I really wanted some assistance, some direction as to what I do, who I talk to, to tell my story to. But, it seemed like no one would listen to me. It’s College basketball — nobody wants to hear any of that. I had no choice. You know, I wrote a book. \nRaven-Symone: At the same time, I feel like, did something happen to make you want start telling these stories? Did something go awry? Why did you ultimately come out? Because in situations like that, some confidentiality agreements. So I was wondering did someone treat you wrong? \nMichelle Collins: Was it to sell a book? \nKP: To sell a book. \nPF: You took notes the whole time. Did you know one day you were going to come forth with this story? \nKP: That wasn’t the plan, I always kept journals. I wrote down everything and documented everything that I have done. So, I kept the journals just for my own protection in case anything came out or anything happened. Someone said that this didn’t happen, I had my own protection. \nMC: In addition to having sex with the players, you also had sex with their parents? Are you saying the parents knew that this kind of activity was going on as well? \nKP: Yes, yes \nRS: We have somebody in our audience, Larry Wilder, your attorney, I find it interesting, there are no legal things going on, this is a very touchy topic, can you explain why there is nothing happening? \nLarry Wilder: Most importantly, the crimes that occurred in selling sex for money in Kentucky is a class A misdemeanor, the statute of limitations for prosecuting that is a year. And then the bigger potential crime would be promoting prostitution, and that would be a class D felony in Kentucky, it does not have a statute of limitations. Our positions is, if they’re going to try to prosecute Ms. Powell then they need to prosecute Mr. McGee as well because Mr. McGee also participated about contacting Ms. Powell paying for the parties and paying for ultimately the provision of sex. So our position is, commonwealth of Kentucky wants to prosecute someone they need to prosecute the basketball coach and Ms. Powell. \nRS: But he is staying strong and saying he didn’t do anything, right? \nPF: Pitino? Pitino is saying that he knew nothing. Let me just divulge this, my husband coached basketball, played basketball he says that this is nothing new this has been going on he had to recruit. I’m not saying — He didn’t participate in any of this. But he has heard of underage drinking, prostitution, gifting. But, I want to talk to you girls, what was that atmosphere like, loud music, sex, you’re in a dorm on campus? What was the atmosphere like? \nRod Ni Powell: It was normal. I guess, not something that you see every day. At the end of the day, everybody was grown. It was just something fun to do. \nPF: Was everybody aware in that dorm of what was going on? \nRP: Well do you mean what was going with side deals? \nMC: That you were getting paid to have sex with these guys. \nRP: Yea, the people that we were with. I don’t know about random people in the dorms. \nPF: I’m saying, was it pretty overt of what was going on? If I live a couple of dorms down, do I know there are strippers? If you live that dorm, you know what’s going on? \nRP: Yes. \nPF: You’re a mom, why did you want to bring your daughters into this situation? \nKP: See, my daughters brought themselves into this situation. I have done this since 2010, I have dealt with U of L until 2010. My daughters didn’t come into the picture until late 2013. They knew about this but it was fun. The girls I had doing it they were basically there ages. The basketball players were their ages. \nMC: Was this something you had done for years, before 2010? Did you have girls you worked with before this scandal? \nKP: No. \nPF: You said it was fun, it was fun for everybody involved? \nRP: Going to the parties and just like being around basketball players and things like that. \nRS: That sounds fun. I’m sorry, it sounds like a normal party. \nRP: People make is seem worse. I mean it’s a big deal. Everyone needs to –everyone wasn’t right – but at the end of the day, it’s not as bad as people make it seem. \nRS: It went a little sideways. Do you guys still talk to any of the basketball players? Did you have sex with more than one? \nLindsay Powell: No. \nPF: It only happened one time with each player? \nLP: Only one time. \nPF: We reached out to the University of Louisville and Andre McGee’s attorney, they all declined to comment due to pending investigation. I want to ask you one last time. Do you think Rick Pitino was aware of what was going on? Or was it a don’t ask don’t tell. Turn you cheek the other way. \nKP: you got all of these players who are so loyal to Pitino, they heard the music, know the parties are going on, see the strippers, they see all of this, who’s not going to go back and say, Rick, there are strippers and loud music and girls taking their clothes off. \nPF: As far as you know Andre was the only one who had direct ties to the University of Louisville? He was coordinating this, correct? The only administrator, correct? \nKP: That I knew of. \nPF: So, I want to ask you one more time, this is all about the book for you? \nKP: Mm-hmm. \nPF: And all about the money that comes with it? \nKP: It’s about the book and the money. I would be lying to say it wasn’t. I think people get the wrong perception, it’s like, bash me because what I have done, the big picture is, do you want your can child to come to college, as a young boy, and leave as a grown man with, you know, with two girls. You know, it was what it was. \nRP: It’s just the fact that people are overlooking the big picture. Everybody played their part in it, but, I mean, people are sending their kids to universities and you’re not even caring about that fact that this stuff happens and no telling what else happens. You know if they call us what else are they doing. But they are overlooking that, to tell us how bad people we are, you don’t know what people do behind closed doors. \nPF: That’s fair, you said they were all willing parties.
