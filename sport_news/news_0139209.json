Many Sikhs settled abroad are reportedly putting off their visits to Punjab for now. NRI Sabha member Pritam Singh Narangpuri said: “Everyday I get many calls and messages from our community members settled abroad. As of now, very few have confirmed their annual visit back home. Those returning this time are people who cannot avoid a marriage function of a close relative or attending to an ailing parent.” The reports of lower influx of the Punjabi NRIs is expected to affect business and investments in the state, especially of those dealing in property, high-end wedding trousseaus, money changers and hoteliers. Ashwani Bhandari, who owns a wedding garments’ shop in the old city, says: “This year our business is slow. NRIs start pouring in around this time of the year but none has arrived so far, which is affecting our business. Since NRIs invest in ethnic attire more than others, we value them a lot. If tension continues to prevail and NRIs don’t return, the entire market in Doaba will suffer.” Harkiratpal Singh Toor, state president, NRI BJP cell, too, admits that the ongoing unrest will affect the inflow of NRIs this time. “We hope that the state government is able to control the situation in time. We want NRI Sabha elections to be held by December or January. We are also planning a conference around that time,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:07.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
