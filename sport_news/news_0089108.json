By Solange Reyner \nThe Juanita-Sammamish KingCo 3A/2A football game set for tonight, Oct. 2, has been cancelled because Sammamish cannot safely field a team due to low numbers. \nSammamish played Bellevue last Friday and lost, 47-7. The Totems also had to forfeit last year’s game against Juanita because they did not have enough players. \nHere’s what Juanita athletic director Steve Juzeler sent out on Friday morning: “Juanita Family- We would like to inform you that the Juanita/Sammamish varsity football game scheduled for 7pm this evening has been cancelled. Due to low numbers, Sammamish cannot safely field a team. Sportsmanship and safety are priorities at Juanita and we support their decision in these unfortunate circumstances. Once a Rebel, Always a Rebel.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:28:07.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
