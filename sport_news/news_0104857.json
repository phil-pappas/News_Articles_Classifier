Alex Goode added one conversion following Hodgson's departure. \nThe home side dominated in all areas with Sale putting in a particularly poor performance. The visitors' pack retreated at every scrum so there was no platform for Danny Cipriani to develop. As a result, he turned in a disappointing effort, distinguished by some aimless kicking. \nCipriani's penalty was Sale's only score as Saracens relaxed after building up a match-winning lead of 27-3 before the interval. \nCipriani was in Sale's starting line-up, partnering Chris Cusiter at half-back. New signings, Bryn Evans and Bryan Mujati made their Premiership debut for the club. \nEngland squad members Goode and Jamie George started for Saracens with Mako Vunipola and George Kruis on the bench. Michael Rhodes, a summer signing from the Stormers, made his debut in the back row. \nIt was Rhodes, who put Sarries ahead after only five minutes by finishing off a driving line-out for a try, which Hodgson converted. \nSale had their first chance for points but Cipriani was wide with a penalty attempt before Hodgson rewarded the home side's dominance in the opening quarter by kicking a penalty. \nCipriani was successful with his second kick at goal to leave his side trailing 10-3 at the end of the first quarter before Hodgson extended Saracens' lead with his second penalty. \nAfter 28 minutes, Saracens scored their second try. From a line-out in the visitors' 22, a strong burst from Duncan Taylor got the hosts over the gain line before Streather slipped past a weak tackle from Sale wing Will Addison for the try. \nWith the last movement of the first half, Sarries sealed the match with another try. A well-timed pass from Hodgson sent Goode away, who had no trouble in sending Ellery over. Hodgson added his fourth conversion for a 27-3 half-time lead. \nWithin five minutes of the re-start, Saracens lost Taylor through injury, with the centre still groggy after a first half collision. Nick Tompkins replaced him before Vunipola and Kruis were introduced with half an hour remaining. \nDespite now playing against the wind, Sale showed more fight in the opening period of the second half than they did in the whole of the first. \nMujati split the home defence apart with one powerful run but Sale could not capitalise and the hosts resumed control. \nThe game became very scrappy, being disrupted by a whole host of replacements, which resulted in the third quarter being scoreless. \nHowever after 62 minutes, Saracens picked up a bonus point when a clever inside pass from Ben Spencer sent Ellery in for his second try. Hodgson converted before leaving the field to be replaced by Ben Ransom. \nCipriani was also replaced at that stage as was his skipper Dan Braid, but it made little difference to their inept performance with Fraser's late try emphasising Saracens' superiority.
