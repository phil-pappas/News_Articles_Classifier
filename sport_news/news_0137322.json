We won’t get too carried away with practice,” Whincup told Seven Network. \n“It’s a cool number though.” \nSeven Network claimed Pye became the first driver to crack the 300kph barrier on the mountain, hitting a top of 304kph. \nV8 Supercars are yet to confirm the speed. \nPye dipped his hat to Whincup who is hoping to turn around his season at the Bathurst 1000 after arriving at Mount Panorama in eighth place in the series. \n“I am pumped but all respect to Jamie,” he said. \nQualifying starts at 1550 (AEDT).
