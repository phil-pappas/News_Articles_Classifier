Fewer than three minutes later, Gelinas’ slap shot tied on the Devils’ second power play.\nWashington outshot the Devils 11-5 in the second period but failed to capitalize on a two-man advantage that lasted 1:38. T.J. Oshie had the best chance of the stretch when the Devils were caught on a line change, but Kinkaid stretched out his right pad to deny the forward.\nMoments later at even strength, Holtby denied Henrique on with a similar stop.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under adam henrique ,  alex ovechkin ,  eric gelinas ,  new jersey devils ,  washington capitals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:11:16.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
