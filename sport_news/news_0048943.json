However, all some people want to remember is the \"3\" - or more specifically, the last one of those three losses that knocked the top-seeded Wildcats out of the NCAA tournament before the second weekend. \nBut for Ryan Arcidiacono and his teammates, the number 33 brings back memories of all the great things the Wildcats did last year, including capturing the regular season and tournament championships in the Big East. \n\"I hate to lose, don't get me wrong,\" Arcidiacono, a senior guard, said Wednesday during the conference's media day at Madison Square Garden. \"But we need to appreciate and look at all the great things and the positive things that we did last year. \n\"I know the three losses were tough. We definitely could have done some things to prevent those. But I think as a whole, you have to look at what we did throughout the season, not just the three individual games where we got beat. I think it was a good year for all. I'm going to remember it as one of the best years of my life.\" More coverage SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise \nThe Wildcats were eliminated by North Carolina State, 71-68, in their second NCAA game in Pittsburgh with two of their three-point shooters, Arcidiacono and Dylan Ennis, going ice-cold. They were three points down when Ennis missed a three-ball with about 30 seconds remaining. \nVillanova coach Jay Wright realizes that people want to talk about that game because \"we know we get judged by the NCAA tournament publicly.\" But the team doesn't judge itself in the same way. \n\"We've got to own what happened,\" he said. \"We respect what people say but we take great pride in the fact that we were able [last season] to bring it every night, 36 games. We lost three of them but we brought it. Even in the N.C. State game, we didn't play well but we brought great effort. We brought great attitude, hung in there until the end. That is what we concentrated on, and not the fact that we didn't advance to the second weekend.\" \nThat was last season. The Wildcats were picked Wednesday to finish first in the Big East regular season in a unanimous vote of the league's coaches. Wright joked that while he's humbled by the vote and \"has great respect for those guys, I question their basketball acumen a little bit.\" \nIn addition, highly touted guard Jalen Brunson was named Big East freshman of the year, Arcidiacono was picked first-team all-Big East, and center Daniel Ochefu earned a second-team berth. \nVillanova lost three key starters from last year in guards Darrun Hilliard and Dylan Ennis and forward JayVaughn Pinkston. Hilliard and Pinkston exhausted their eligibility while Ennis decided to go to Oregon for his fourth year, saying he wanted to be a full-time point guard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:42:23.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
