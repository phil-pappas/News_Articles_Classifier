(Anderson) to run the ball. They really stepped up in a crucial time when we needed to run the ball.\" \nDespite struggling to run the football in the first quarter, the Broncos continued to stress a balanced offense, and their persistence paid off as they increased their average to 4.61 yards-per-rush by the end of the game. \n\"I thought it was good,\" quarterback Peyton Manning said. \"I thought CJ and Ronnie ran the ball well. I thought the line did a good job. We were trying to stay in-phase. We obviously didn't run it as well in the red zone down there, which put us in some third-and-longs and forced us to have to settle for a field goal. I thought those guys ran hard, and there were some good holes there. Especially on that last drive, there were some good holes.\" \nBroncos coach Gary Kubiak added, \"We didn't abandon it. I tried to hang in there with it. I thought we ran the ball pretty well. I think we could still run it better, but we were more committed to it. We tried to stay more balanced in what we were doing.\" \nThe Broncos (6-0) came into the game with the third-worst rushing attack in the NFL, but despite averaging 71.6 yards over the first five contests, they more than doubled their production against the Browns (2-4). Their aim is to keep that running game going when they get back from the annual bye week. \n\"We had to help the defense, we can't keep them on the field too long,\" Hillman said. \"They are really good, but we need to keep them off the field as much as possible. I think us running the ball and being successful with it helped manage the game a little better. \n\"We never want to stay on a plateau. We still have a long way to go. The crazy thing is this offense can only get better. It can't get any worse. We are going to make corrections next week and get ready for a big game against the Green Bay Packers.\" \nWhile the Broncos look to continue their success in the running game, the Browns aim to turn around their fortunes against opposing rushers. \n\"They just made more plays,\" inside linebacker Karlos Dansby said. \"They made more plays down the stretch. We had opportunities. We just didn't capitalize. They just made plays. We were just pressing, trying to get off the field, and they just made more plays than we did.\" \nOutside linebacker Paul Kruger added, \"I think today was a really good step. I felt like guys were out there a little more loose than usual. It felt like we were playing really aggressive. I'll have to analyze the tape a little bit and see how we looked. All in all, I think we made a lot of good plays on defense. \n\"That is obviously a good team. They clearly made more plays than we did to win the game, but I truly, in my heart, feel like we are the ones that beat ourselves, more so than the Broncos beating us.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LIw9F8 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:12:40.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
