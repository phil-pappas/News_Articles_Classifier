The crash happened over the weekend earlier this month in Everett.\nSixty-five-year-old Valarie’s injuries are so serious more than a week later she's getting ready to have a surgery on her pelvis Tuesday. Police say on Oct. 3 she was crossing Fourth Avenue just south of 128th in Everett when a car hit her so hard it sent her flying.\n. @SnoCoSheriff still looking for vehicle that struck this #Everett woman. We talk to her, still hospitalized. pic.twitter.com/7sYGeFAGKC\n— Joanna Small (@JoannaKIRO7) October 12, 2015 Monday she could only stay awake long enough to talk with us on the phone from her room in Harborview Medical Center.\n\"I don't remember what happened at all,” she told us.\nShe says she doesn't remember what happened but witnesses have a vehicle description. @KIRO7Seattle at 5 & 6. pic.twitter.com/28kUve73rg\n— Joanna Small (@JoannaKIRO7) October 12, 2015 Fortunately, other people do remember -- at least enough to give police a lead.\n\"Witnesses think it was a passenger vehicle, probably dark colored,” Shari Ireton with the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office said.\nThose witnesses told police they saw that car strike Valarie ; they stopped, but the car did not. They said the driver even turned off the headlights before speeding off. Now the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office is asking for your help.\n\"If you noticed anyone that has a damaged car, the front end or maybe an auto collision shop did some work that matches that description,” Ireton said, please tell police.\nUnfortunately, she says, it usually takes a friend, family member, or the suspects themselves coming forward for there to be an arrest. Valarie hopes showing graphic pictures of what she looks like now from her daughter's Facebook page will help trigger someone’s guilty conscience.\n“Valarie how much do you want to see this person get caught?\" we asked her.\n\"Very much so,” she replied.\nWe checked -- a hit and run that causes serious injury to another person is a Class C Felony punishable by up to five years in jail and a $10,000 fine.\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
