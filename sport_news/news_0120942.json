I felt like my freshman year I should have won the Doak Walker Award, but they gave it to him.\"\n\"Anyway, I feel like I was a better player than him,\" Peterson added. \"Here I am a true freshman. If Cedric can come in and play, then why couldn’t I do it?\"\nTime off for Luck \nThe beating Andrew Luck has taken this season on the field is taking a toll.\nCoach Chuck Pagano decided to give Luck most of Wednesday’s practice off so he could rest his sore throwing shoulder. Pagano said it was only a precaution and he expects Luck to play Sunday against Jacksonville.\n\"I’m not a witch doctor, I don’t have a crystal ball. I just listen to the trainers and the doctors, but I wouldn’t bet against 12, ever,\" Pagano said, referring to Luck’s jersey number.\nSince the Colts (1-2) drafted him with the top overall pick in 2012, Luck has been one of the league’s most durable players. He has started all 57 games, including the playoffs, and hasn’t showed up on an injury report since late in his rookie season when he was listed with a knee injury.\nLuck insists this injury is no big deal.\n\"There’s always bumps and bruises that show up in high school, college and the NFL. You deal with stuff, you manage it,\" Luck said. \"It’s nothing more than that in my mind.\"\nBrees throws \nSaints coach Sean Payton says it’s \"safe to say\" Drew Brees is going to throw at every practice this week as the quarterback attempts to come back from a right shoulder injury.\nBrees sat out Sunday’s loss at Carolina because of a bruised rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder and did not throw at practice last week. It was the first start Brees had missed because of an injury in his NFL career.\nThe Saints (0-3) host Dallas on Sunday night.\nPayton says Brees has \"done well\" with his rehabilitation and his performance at practice will show whether he’s healthy enough to play.\n— The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:43:38.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
