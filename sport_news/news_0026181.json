The farmers will urge the CMto write off loans taken by small and marginal farmers from banks and private moneylenders. Punjab page: Samjhauta Express cancellation triggers diplomatic furore Over 20 lakh commuters affected Women too show up in big numbers Villagers set up langars for protesters While a senior official in the CM’s office said the CM would go to the meeting with an open mind and try to resolve all reasonable issues raised by farmers, the protesters said they won’t cede ground on any of their demands. More than 200 trains have been cancelled in the state due to the farmers’ agitation so far, causing a loss of over Rs100 crore to the Railways. The protesting farmers are expected to announce their future course of agitation after meeting the CM at the Punjab Bhavan tomorrow. Farmer leader Sukhdev Kokrikalan said, “As most of the farmers are unable to repay their loans due to damage to their crops, it will be proper to write off the same as is done in case of sick industries.” The farmers would also urge the government to enact a law in that regard, he said. They would also ask the CM to act against owners of the companies that supplied spurious seeds and pesticides to farmers. “We will also seek action against Agriculture Minister as he failed to ensure supply of quality pesticides and seeds to farmers,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:22:45.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
