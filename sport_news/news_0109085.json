This team literally is a family. The JVs don’t even have to show up at our practices, but they always do.” \nMoravian Academy outshot Southern Lehigh 13-3 and had a 15-3 edge in corners. Spartans sophomore goalie Jenna Cyr kept the game scoreless until Clune drove a pass in the direction of Pearce, who knocked it in from the left post. \n“Mayve was moving the ball toward the circle,” Pearce said. “She dribbled past a few players, pushed it toward the goal, and I hit it in.” \nThe Lions stretched their lead to 2-0 three minutes later when Clune received a pass from Cecily Redfern and delivered a powerful backhand into the cage. It was Clune’s team-leading 34 th goal of the season. \n“It was a reverse hit,” Clune said. “That is a little more risky, but I went with it because I didn’t have too many other opportunities. Practice pays off.” \nMoravian coach Debbie Bross has come to expect these types of performances from Clune in big games. \n“Mayv always rises to the occasion,” Bross said. “She always plays up to the competition. That’s a future Division I player right there.” \nSenior midfielder Katie Persin erased any hopes of a Spartans comeback when she tallied the third goal with 9: 25 remaining. \n“We were nervous (when it was scoreless),” Clune said. “We just had to take a minute to regain our composure and play our game. All the coaches pulled us together and said ‘we got this.’ That was all it took. After that we played great.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
