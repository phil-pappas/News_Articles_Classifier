The Toledo Area Metroparks are full with walkers, joggers, and photographers. Executive Director of the Toledo Area Metroparks Stephen Madewell says about 1 million people visit Wildwood Metropark each year and a lot of them focus on the fall season. Kara Pastorek brought her camera along to Wildwood on Wednesday. She was focused on a row of maple trees that were bright red in color, “It is fantastic; it is almost as if you were taking a drive up north and you are just in your backyard.” The ODNR said the heavy rain from spring and early summer means most trees are healthy going into the middle of the fall season. That could mean more vibrant fall colors compared to normal. Cooler mornings over the next several days will mean colors will change fast. That will leave good viewing conditions over the weekend. However, more wind will also mean the colors will be falling to the ground quick as well.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Fall33.jpg", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*264/Fall33.jpg", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3B1/2AF/3B12AF88B37B4EDC9C96370A20A903AF.mp4", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:07:33.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
