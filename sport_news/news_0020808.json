The Eagles scored first with 2 minutes, 12 seconds left in the first quarter on a 70-yard keeper from 160-pound quarterback Zack Beeler.\nThe Eagles then gave the ball to 240-pound back Dalton Rodgers, whose 17-yard touchdown helped give Gibbs a 12-0 lead heading into the second quarter.\nSouth-Doyle (0-8, 0-4) cut its deficit to 12-7 moments later when Jeremiah Bias reached over a Gibbs defender to snag a 42-yard touchdown pass from Braden Anderson.\nRodgers, who finished with 110 yards rushing, rolled off a 16-yard TD run late in the half, before adding a 4-yard TD run midway through the third quarter to give the Eagles a 26-7 lead.\nLate in the third, Gibbs slotback Logan Wolfenbarger broke a 49-yard touchdown run. He also made three PATs. Dillion Thomas extended the Eagles lead on a 1-yard TD run, which came after a Gibbs fumble recovery on a punt. South-Doyle's Seandre Scott had an 11-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.\n\"I'm very proud of our kids for coming out and playing with a lot of pride and a lot of passion,\" Conley said.\nSouth-Doyle had to win on Friday to stay in playoff contention. Instead, the Cherokees will miss the postseason for the first time since 2010.\nStill, South-Doyle coach Clark Duncan believes the future is bright for his young team.\n\"The good thing about it is that most of these kids are going to be around for the next couple of years,\" he said.\nJohn Shearer is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:18:36.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
