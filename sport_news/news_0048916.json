Show Caption Previous Next \nTORONTO - The seventh inning of the decisive Game 5 of the AL Division Series might have been one of the wildest in baseball inning, as the Toronto Blue Jays held on to beat the Texas Rangers 6-3. \nIn the top of the frame, a deflected throw back to the mound by Toronto catcher Russell Martin allowed Texas to score the tie-breaking run in the seventh inning, touching off a long delay and causing the Blue Jays to play Game 5 of the AL Division Series under protest. \nFans littered the field with debris during the 18-minute delay as umpires sorted out one of the most unusual plays in playoff history. \nWith Odor at third base and two outs, Martin's throw back to the mound appeared to hit the hand of batter Shin-Soo Choo, allowing Odor to sprint home as the ball rolled up the third base line for a 3-2 lead. \nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister came out, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home. \nAccording to rule Major League Baseball rule 6.03(a)(3), the batter is not to be charged with interfering with the catcher if the batter is still in the batter's box and doesn't make a movement to block or disrupt the throw. Your browser does not support iframes. \nThis type of play is not subject to manager's review but Scott, the crew chief, after discussing the ruling with Blue Jays manager John Gibbons, called an umpire's review. After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field. \nToronto Mayor John Tory tweeted, \"Don't hurt each other or our city over this. We can prove ourselves in more ways than one. #ComeTogether\" \nBut to quote Rasheed Wallace: \"Ball don't lie.\" \nIn the Blue Jays' next at-bat, two errors by the Rangers infield set up a run-scoring grounder by Josh Donaldson. Three pitches later, slugger Jose Bautista uncorked a massive homer (and bat flip). \n— Matt Sebek (@MattSebek) October 14, 2015 \nThe homer proved to the the difference in the Blue Jays' 6-3 win. \n— Brian Costa (@BrianCostaWSJ) October 14, 2015 \nToronto advances to the American League Championship Series.
