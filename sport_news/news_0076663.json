He’s really the backbone of our team.”\nNate Lee and Nate Moskowitz scored for Roeper (5-12-1) in the second half.\nRiverside Academy-West’s only score came on an own goal by Roeper.\n“They scored on us without ever taking a shot,” Sack said.\nHe said despite the win, goalkeeper Calvin Lind, who has been strong in net for most of the season, learned a valuable lesson.\n“I was disappointed from the leadership in the back,” Sack said. “He learned a lesson about how to lead from the back better today.”\nSack said his goal is to see his team repeat its district title, and that he would like to see it repeat as D4 champion — after winning the first title in school history a year ago. However, Roeper has been shorthanded down the stretch, missing seven starters at one point.\n“It’s been hard,” Sack said.\nTwo key starters for Roeper are still out of the lineup. Jerry Flynn (undisclosed) and Ben Goldberg (fractured clavicle) have missed significant time.\nSack said he expects Goldberg to be back soon — perhaps in time for Roeper’s semifinal game next Tuesday — while Flynn is out for the rest of the season.\n“I bet he will,” Sack said of Goldberg’s chances to be cleared next week. “He looks like he’s good.”\nRoeper will play Madison Heights Bishop Foley — which beat Detroit Cristo Rey 3-2 — next Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. at Bishop Foley.\nMore boys soccer district scores \nAdrian 3, Carleton Airport 0\nAnn Arbor Greenhills 4, Blissfield 0\nBerkley 2, Troy 1 (OT)\nBirmingham Seaholm 2, Birmingham Brother Rice 1\nBloomfield Hills 3, Southfield-Lathrup 1.\nBloomfield Hills Cranbrook Kingswood 1, Holly 0 (Cranbrook won 5-4 on penalty kicks)\nChelsea 5, Jackson Northwest 0\nClarkston 5, Waterford Kettering 2\nClinton Township Chippewa Valley 3, Sterling Heights 0\nDavison 3, Waterford Mott 2\nDexter 3, Parma Western 0\nFraser 3, Sterling Heights Stevenson 2\nGrand Blanc 1, Swartz Creek 0\nGrosse Pointe North 8, East Detroit 0\nLinden 2, Orchard Lake St. Mary 1\nMadison Heights Bishop Foley 3, Detroit Cristo Rey 2\nManchester 3, Ann Arbor Rudolf Steiner 2\nMilan 8, Romulus 0\nMilford 2, White Lake Lakeland 1\nOxford 1, Lake Orion 0\nPontiac Notre Dame Prep 1, Fenton 0\nRochester Adams 2, Rochester 0\nRochester Hills Lutheran Northwest 6, Dryden 0\nRochester Hills Stoney Creek 8, Pontiac 0\nRoseville 2, Warren Mott 0\nRoyal Oak 1, Birmingham Groves 0\nSouthfield Christian 4, Madison Heights Madison 0\nTecumseh 5, New Boston Huron 1\nTroy Athens 4, Harrison Township L’Anse Creuse 0\nWalled Lake Northern 4, South Lyon 0\nWarren De La Salle 2, St. Clair Shores Lakeview 1\nYpsilanti Community 2, Monroe Jefferson 1\nVolleyball \nNew Baltimore Anchor Bay d.
