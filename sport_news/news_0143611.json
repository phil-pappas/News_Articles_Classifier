RAMSEY – Donald Stewart spent Friday night making one spectacular catch after another.\nBut the Paramus Catholic senior receiver saved his best reception literally for last. Stewart, surrounded by multiple Don Bosco defenders and falling in the end zone, caught the game-winning, 35-yard touchdown pass from sophomore quarterback Allan Walters on the last play of the game to lead the Paladins to a season-saving, 19-16 victory over rival Don Bosco.\nStewart’s incredible catch came on a fourth-and-10 play that began with five seconds left on the clock and set off a wild celebration among a Paramus Catholic squad that desperately needed a win. Paramus Catholic appeared on its way to losing a third straight game, but Don Bosco was flagged for defensive holding during an incompletion on a fourth-and-10 play from Don Bosco’s 45-yard line four plays before Stewart’s game-winning catch.\nThe thrilling victory prevented Paramus Catholic from falling to 1-4 and extended the Paladins’ winning streak to four games over Big North United Division rival Don Bosco.\n“Donald makes great catches like that all the time,” said Rashan Gary, Paramus Catholic’s star senior defensive lineman. “I’m used to seeing him do stuff like that. As soon as I saw his pink gloves go up for the ball, I knew he would catch it. That’s my brother. He said he was going to make a big play for us and that’s what he did.”\nThe stunning defeat ended Don Bosco’s three-game winning streak. Moments before Stewart’s sensational play, the Ironmen looked as though they would win another important game.\nDon Bosco took a 16-13 lead on the previous drive, thanks to a 23-yard field goal by senior kicker Ethan Cordaro with 1:42 left in the game.\nParamus Catholic came back from a 13-6 deficit when Stewart caught a 13-yard touchdown toss from Walters with 1:56 to go in the third quarter. Stewart finished with five catches for 145 yards and two touchdowns.\nThe Ironmen (3-2), ranked No. 3 in The Record Non-Public Top 6, went ahead, 13-6, on a 9-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Tommy DeVito to sophomore running back/receiver Kevin Brennan just 2:02 into the third quarter.\nDeVito previously threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to sophomore running back Tommy Courtney, which tied the game at 6 with 20 seconds to go in the first half. Don Bosco’s extra-point attempt was blocked.\nOn the prior drive, a 4-yard touchdown run by senior tailback Ahmad Thomas gave Paramus Catholic a 6-0 lead at the 2:58 mark of the second. Stewart’s 33-yard catch on the previous play set up that touchdown.\nThomas finished with 92 yards on 17 carries.\nDon Bosco senior tailback Malik Bakker was extremely productive in defeat. He rushed for 254 yards on 33 carries.\nIt was Paramus Catholic, however, that headed home with the most important statistic of all – its second victory of an up-and-down season that suddenly seems salvagable.\n“This is a win we had to have,” Gary said. “It was a great win for us. I hope this is something that turns around our season.”\nEmail: idec@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:48:01.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
