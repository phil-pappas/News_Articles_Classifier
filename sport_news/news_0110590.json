She picked UNI over Illinois State, Western Illinois and South Dakota State, among others. \n“At first, I thought (the recruiting process) was going to be so fun,” Blue said. “Then it kind of started to drag and it became pretty stressful. \n“Nothing felt quite right until I talked more with UNI. They wanted to know about me as a person.” \nBlue has been a cornerstone of the Jefferson sprinting corps since her arrival as a freshman. Last spring, the J-Hawks won state titles in the 400- and 800-meter relays and were second in the sprint medley relay. \nJefferson owns the all-time Iowa best in the 800 relay (1:39.24, set at the 2015 state meet) and shares the Iowa record in the 400 relay (47.55, at the 2015 Drake Relays). \nBlue intends to major in sports marketing and management at UNI. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:02:29.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
