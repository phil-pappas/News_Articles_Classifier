The Krainocks are looking forward to the National League Division Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs. Alice, a life-long Cardinals fan, and John, a die-hard Cubs fan, have been married for more than 20 years. Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015 6:40 am A House Divided:Cards-Cubs rivalry intensifies with playoff matchup   \nDANVILLE — The biggest question this week in Vermilion County will be — Cardinals or Cubs? \nThat's because the two long-time National League rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs, will be meeting for the first-time ever in a National League postseason series. \nThe National League Division Series between the teams will begin tonight at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, and there are several households in this area that will be split between the teams. \n\"It's a big deal, but we won't be beating each other up over it,'' said Cardinals fan Alice Krainock, owner of Main Street Bar and Grill. \"As a Cardinals fan, I've seen my team play in the playoff so many times, but we have never had to face our arch-rivals.'' \nThe Cardinals and the Cubs have been playing each other since 1892 with Chicago winning 1,194 meetings and St. Louis has 1,144 victories. But when it comes to World Series titles, the Cardinals have 11, the last one came in 2011, while the Cubs have just two, with their last one being back in 1908. \n\"That just shows how baseball has changed,'' said Danville Dans media relations director Tom Fricke, a St. Louis Cardinals fan. \"Up until just about 10 years ago, only one team from their division made the playoffs. \n\"It's a chance for both sides to put their money where their mouth is, so to speak.'' \nWhile John Krainock, a Cubs fan, admits he is going to make a few friendly wagers with a few friends, who cheer for the Cardinals, he has no plans to make a bet with his wife of more than 20 years. \n\"Between us. We try to be very civil with each other,'' he said. \"I will watch the Cardinals games with her and commensurate with her and she will do the same with the Cubs. \n\"But deep down inside, you are probably hoping they lose.'' \nMary Ellen Fricke, who roots for the Cubs, echoed those sentiments. \n\"The Cards and Cubs rivalry is a good-natured rivalry,'' she said. \"It's honest and heart-felt. It's not mean and nasty like some in baseball.'' \nThe Krainocks said they knew up front that they were on opposite sides of the rivalry. \n\"All of her family have been Cardinals fans and my parent were Cubs fans,'' John said. \"We were both just raised that way.'' \nFor the Frickes, it was a little different as their first date was actually a Cardinals-Cubs game. \n\"It was a bus trip to Chicago,'' said Mary Ellen. \"I   googly eyed with each other, we didn't really pay much attention to the game. \n\"By the second game, the novelty of a new romance had worn off and it was on.'' \nThe Krainocks, who figure they have probably seen more than 20 games between Chicago and St. Louis, go to games now with another couple with split ties. \n\"Two of our close friends, Brenda and Shannon Lippert, are also a Cubs/Cardinals couple,'' Alice said. \"He is a Cardinal fan and she is a Cub fan. We try to go to a game every year with those two.'' \nAnd the Krainocks admit it's a little more enjoyable that way. \nThey have also figured out a way to watch the games at home. \n\"When the Cubs are batting, we watch Comcast; and when the Cardinals are batting, we watch Fox Sports Net,'' Alice said. \n\"That's because I can't stand the Cardinal announcers and she doesn't like the guys on the Cubs broadcast,'' John said. \nFor the Frickes, going to a game together has been a unique experience. \n\"After we were married, we went to St. Louis on the Fourth of July weekend. It was right after Jim Edmonds had joined the Chicago Cubs,'' Tom said. \"I told her to watch this when Edmonds came to bat. The crowd gave him a 2-minute standing ovation and then clapped just as loud when he struck out.'' \nMary Ellen said that she spent most of the weekend hearing people making goat sounds at her. \nAnd while a lot of people believe in that curse for the Cubs, Tom actually thinks that it could be over. \n\"I think that's why it is happening this year,'' he said. \"The Cubs tore down the old bleachers and rebuilt them, I think they tore down the curse with it.'' \nFormer Danville Dan outfielder Ronnie Jebavy, who lived with the Frickes, has already sent a text to them about this week. \n\"Ronnie asked if we were going to be sleeping in different rooms,'' Tom said. \nMary Ellen didn't reveal what her answer was to that question. \n\"For years, I've heard that I never knew there was baseball in October before I married him,'' she said. \"Now, I know.''
