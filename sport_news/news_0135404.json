The last window was a really strange one to say the least. They only got Petr Cech and not getting any outfield players, I thought at the time, was a huge mistake. \n\"If they go and win the league, you will say Arsene Wenger was right. I don't think there's a lot to fear. \n\"Manchester United had a brilliant performance today, Man City can turn it on but they can also throw games away. \n\"Arsenal have found some rhythm. They had a hard start to the season when they lost at home to West Ham and Olympiakos and Dinamo Zagreb, but at the moment they look as good as anybody, so why can't they win the league?\" \nHenry agreed with Redknapp but admitted they need to add consistency to their game in order to make title dreams a reality. \n\"They are in the mix for me,\" Henry said. \n\"Today was a massive response knowing everybody had won. Everybody was waiting to see if they were going to back up the win against United. Can they do it and maintain it for more than 15, maybe 20 games? That's what we want to see. \n\"They have to play like that all the time and win games like that sometimes where for an hour they struggle and then come out on top. \n\"Everybody can dream. If you love Arsenal I think they can win the title this season.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:32:05.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
