''It's always emotional going back there (Old Trafford).''\nThe midfielder went on to captain England and play for Real Madrid , the Los Angeles Galaxy and AC Milan before ending his career at Paris Saint-Germain in May 2013. The same month, Ferguson retired from United after more than 26 years as manager and he has not been back in the dugout since then.\nThe pair is being reunited two years after Ferguson used his autobiography to bemoan an apparent preoccupation with fame by Beckham and how it affected his work-rate before being sold to Madrid.\n''He is like a father figure to me, he has been for so many years, and he gave me the chance to play for Manchester United,'' Beckham told the BBC. ''It's an amazing thing to have him involved in this.''\nBeyond the captains, details of who will be playing under Ferguson and Ancelotti, the former AC Milan, Chelsea , Real Madrid and PSG coach, have not been disclosed.\nThe game is Beckham's latest UNICEF initiative after 11 years as a goodwill ambassador.\n''I want a world where children can grow up safe from violence, free from poverty and protected from preventable diseases,'' Beckham said. ''This match gives me the perfect opportunity to raise awareness and vital funds to help reach the children who need it most.''\nSports & Recreation Soccer David Beckham Alex Ferguson Manchester United Real Madrid UNICEF Carlo Ancelotti Zinedine Zidane   19337/79545   2487/10000   1215/4772  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:29:11.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
