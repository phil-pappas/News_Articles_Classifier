Shaffer, 26, is a 2007 Baker High School graduate. She was at her home in Sutherlin, about 10 miles north of Roseburg, this morning when a 20-year-old man opened fire in a building at the Umpqua Community College campus, killing 10 people. Shaffer's father, Walt, a former Baker City resident who now operates a drug store and soda fountain in Union, said Megan texted him this morning. “She said there was a steady stream of ambulances heading south toward Roseburg,” Walt Brookshire said. Eugene, about 68 miles north of Roseburg, has the nearest trauma center to the Umpqua campus. Megan doesn't know any current students at Umpqua, her father said. She earned a bachelor's degree in healthcare policy and administration at Oregon State University and worked for a year as an administrator at an assisted living facility, her father said. But she wanted to work directly with patients, so she decided to return to school and earn her nursing degree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:26:12.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
