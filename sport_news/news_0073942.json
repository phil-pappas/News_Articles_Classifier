RSL were down to 10 men after Olave was sent off for a challenge on Lucas Melano which led to the penalty.\nTimbers coach Caleb Porter unveiled an offense-first lineup tonight that paid off in every way but scoring in the first half as Portland hammered RSL with seven shots. Their 4-3-3 lineup for this game is original, with Diego Chara as the single defensive midfielder and an attack with Adi, Lucas Melano , Rodney Wallace , Diego Valeri and Darlington Nagbe .\nDo you think the move paid off?

Recap our live updates in the comments section below and then chime in with your thoughts on the Timbers as they continue to chase a postseason berth.\n-- Molly Blue\nmblue@oregonian.com\n@mollyablue", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mollyablue"], "published": "2015-10-15T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:12:21.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
