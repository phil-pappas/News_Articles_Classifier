You’ve likely also heard people talk about his eccentric fashion choices, wild good looks, and groundbreaking underwater techniques . And, get this: Ryan Lochte is also a big fan of Boston. Lochte attended the Head of the Charles Regatta (aka one of the most Boston events ever) this weekend to promote the 31st Olympic games , which will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016. Lochte, along with Olympians Nastia Liukin, Dara Torres, and Mary Whipple, is in town for the United States Olympic Committee’s Road to Rio tour . Speaking of the Olympics, when asked how he felt about Boston no longer being in the running to host in 2024, Lochte said: “It stinks. Anytime you can host a big event like the Olympics in the U.S., it’s awesome. We definitely want to have it on our soil. But we’re still gonna represent Team USA no matter where it is.” One reason Lochte may be bummed that he’s not coming back to Boston for the Olympics? The food. His answer to “What’s your favorite thing about Boston?”: Ashli Molina And who better to share a delicacy like chowdah with than Bostonians themselves? Lochte, 31, a notoriously handsome world-class athlete, has a Tinder account. And he confirmed that he has been swiping while he’s in town. He also had only good things to say about the Boston social scene, digital and otherwise. “We went out for dinner and drinks last night. I met a bunch of people, and everyone’s nice,” he said. What’s next on Lochte’s calendar? He’s headed to Colorado for a training camp, then competing in the Arena Pro Swim Series at Minneapolis on November 12-14, TeamUSA.org reports. So you have until the end of the weekend to download Tinder. By", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:11:15.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
