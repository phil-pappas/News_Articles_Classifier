The (Peoria) Journal Star reports (http://bit.ly/1NuD1VM ) that bond was set Saturday at $1.5 million for 51-year-old Bobby L. Archie Jr. He is charged with first-degree murder in the death of 43-year-old Taquila Jackson. Peoria County State's Attorney Jerry Brady says Jackson died after she was struck with a metal object. He didn't offer details on a motive for the killing. A preliminary autopsy found Jackson died of head injuries. Jackson's body was found Thursday night two blocks away from Archie's residence. Online court records didn't list Archie's case. It is unclear if he has an attorney. There was no phone listing for Archie in Peoria. ___ Information from: Journal Star, http://pjstar.com Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:14:00.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
