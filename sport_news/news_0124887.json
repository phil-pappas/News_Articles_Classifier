The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should hit Volkswagen with the maximum possible fine of $18 billion for lying to consumers about nitrogen oxide emissions from thousands of its vehicles, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday.\n\"The company carjacked the trust of hundreds of thousands of consumers and knew it all along,\" said Schumer, who was joined by Sen.
