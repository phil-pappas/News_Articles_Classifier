The Cavaliers (2-5) need to win at least four of them if they want to make a bowl game for the first time since 2011. UVa is 1-2 in the ACC following the loss at North Carolina Saturday. The Wahoos turned the ball over five times in the defeat, and were unable to capitalize on a career day from the man they call 'Smoke.' Taquan Mizzell recorded the first 100-yard rushing game of his career in the loss at UNC, and had thirty total touches against the Tar Heels. \"Thirty touches?\" said Mizzell. \"Yeah, I'm tired. I didn't know it was thirty touches. It was a long day.\" The junior running back carried the ball 24 times for 117 yards, which are both career highs. He also added 57 yards on six receptions. Head coach Mike London says, \"He's one of our best players, if not the best player that we have in terms of production. In terms of being to catch the ball, and run the ball.\" Mizzell has more receiving yards than any other running back in college football this season (466 yards), and is second in the nation with 41 catches (Alex Gardner, FIU - 42). The big game from 'Smoke' on Saturday was part of a UVa ground attack which broke the 200 yard barrier for the first time this year. Mizzell says, \"Us running backs, and the offensive line, we've been working so hard just trying to grind, and shut up all the outside people that say that we can't run the ball; we're not a power team. We just want to show them that we can run the ball.\" The only area Mizzell didn't have a major impact for the 'Hoos was inside the Red Zone. \"We have to find ways to keep using our best guys,\" says London. \"That's the challenge to the coaches, just understanding that the best guys have to be in the game, on the field, at the opportunities to give us a chance to win.\" Quarterback Matt Johns says, \"W get the ball in the Red Zone there, and he had been a big part of us moving the ball. Maybe we get the ball to him, and something else happens, but the game is over. Nothing you can say about it now.\" Virginia will be back at home against Georgia Tech next Saturday at 3:00 PM.
