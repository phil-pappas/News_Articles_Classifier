James DeLeo and zoning lawyer James Banks.\nThe two Jimmys were at the center of the 36 th Ward power structure Sposato toppled with a reform-themed insurgency on the Northwest Side.\n“I can’t hold a grudge against these people because they were against me 4-1/2 years ago,” Sposato told me at his ward office on Harlem Avenue. “No political people were with me back then.”\nOPINION\nFollow @dmihalopoulos\nDuring the 2011 race, Sposato called a news conference at which he cited a memoir by Outfit informant Frank Calabrese Jr. In his book “Operation Family Secrets,” the mob boss’ son accused the 36 th Ward Democrats of being helpful to organized crime.\nDeLeo had addressed the topic 10 years earlier. Chicago Sun-Times reporter Tim Novak asked about campaign contributions the then-state legislator got from a construction company deemed to be mobbed up by the state gaming board.\n“What does that mean, ‘mob-associated?’ ” DeLeo asked Novak. “In the year 2001, is there really a mob in Chicago?”\nYes, Jimmy, it turned out there was a mob, as we learned from the federal Family Secrets case.\nIn federal court in 2007, the wife of murdered mob boss Michael Spilotro testified that DeLeo and another investor ripped her off when they bought her business after her husband was killed.\nThe Spilotro and DeLeo names came up a couple of years later with the release of a “clout list” kept by Gov. Rod Blagojevich. The governor’s office in that era of clean government listed Spilotro’s widow among the state job seekers sponsored by DeLeo.\nThen retiring state Sen. James DeLeo in 2010. File Photo by Patrick Butler\nThese days, DeLeo works as Springfield lobbyist for a list of clients, including Uber. He shares offices with Banks, who continues the zoning law practice founded by his dad, the late Samuel V.P. Banks.\nThe firm got its clients more zoning changes from City Hall than any other during the two decades that Sam Banks’ brother, William J.P. Banks, was 36 th Ward alderman and chairman of the City Council’s Zoning Committee.\nAnd did I mention that Sam Banks represented alleged mobsters?\nNeither Jimmy Banks nor DeLeo returned my calls to their shared office.\nSposato, now representing the 38th Ward, says he made up with Jimmy Banks not long after becoming an alderman, when Sposato’s cousin hired Jimmy Banks to deal with the Zoning Board of Appeals.\n“The city was coming down upon my cousin, wrongfully so,” Sposato says.\nThe friendship between DeLeo and Sposato was formed a couple years ago, the alderman says.\n“We just bumped into each other a couple times at Agostino’s restaurant and at a wake,” Sposato says. “He always called me alderman and offered his help, which blew me away. His kindness and forgiveness . . . He could have said, ‘Screw that guy, I don’t need him.’ I did more to him than he ever did to me.”\nNow, DeLeo is doing something for Sposato.\n“I’m grateful for his help, I have no problem with it,” Sposato says of DeLeo. “At this point, I’m not going to say, ‘Jim, I don’t want to be friends with you, I don’t want your help.’ He’s my constituent.”\nFrank Coconate, a longtime Northwest Side political operative, helped Sposato in the 2011 race, but they later had a falling out.\nCoconate said Sposato has become “that same puppet” that Sposato accused his opponent of being in 2011.\nSposato says the fundraising help from his old foes won’t change his approach to governing: “I don’t think this makes me a non-independent.”\nTweets by @dmihalopoulos", "external_links": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/ED-MULROE-081210-P1_17533311.jpg", "https://twitter.com/dmihalopoulos", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/ED-MULROE-081210-P1_17533311-600x450.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:08:15.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
