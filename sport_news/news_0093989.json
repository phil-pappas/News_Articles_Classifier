Arab lawmakers' planned visit on Friday, when many Muslims attend weekly prayers there, will test enforcement of the ban.\n\"Neither Netanyahu nor the right will be able to stop us from entering our Al-Aqsa mosque,\" Israeli Arab MP Ahmed Tibi said on Thursday, calling the ban \"senseless and illegal\".\nThirteen of Israel's 120 MPs are Arabs.\nThe Al-Aqsa compound has seen repeated clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian youths in recent weeks.\nProvocative visits by Israeli Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel as well as by Israeli Arab lawmakers have added to the volatility.\nThe Al-Aqsa compound is the third-holiest site in Islam.\nMuslims fear Israel will seek to change rules governing the site, which allow Israeli Jews to visit but not pray to avoid provoking tensions. Netanyahu has said repeatedly he is committed to the status quo.\nAn increase in visits by Israeli Jews during a series of Jewish holidays in recent weeks has added to tensions.\nThe site is located in east Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed in a move never recognised by the international community.\n*This story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:32:51.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
