Fisher Catholic took on Worthington Christian Saturday night at Fulton Field. David Stith/Eagle-Gazette (Photo: Picasa) CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLANCASTER â€” Fisher Catholic continued its stellar play on Saturday against visiting Worthington Christian. \nThe Irish, who lost their first two games of the season, won their fifth consecutive game by using a bruising rushing attack out of the wing-t, and the Warriors didn't have an answer. \nThe Irish scored on their opening drive of the game and steady wore the Warriors out in a 27-0 Mid-State League-Cardinal Division victory at Fulton Field. \n\"We tried to develop a different culture,\" Fisher Catholic coach Mike Yonnotti said. \"Our goal is to be physical and fundamentally sound. We feel like if we can run the football and play solid defense, good things are going to happen.\" \nFisher Catholic (5-2, 4-0) did both on Saturday, \nThe Irish piled up 403 total yards, including 369 on the round, and they had 23 first downs. Defensively, Fisher Catholic was outstanding, holding the Warriors (2-5, 1-2) to only 141 total yards and just 52 yards rushing. \nJunior fullback Allen McCall led the way for the Irish on the ground as he finished with 140 yards on 16 carries and two touchdowns. McCall rushed for 125 yards in the second half. \n\"All the credit goes to the offensive line,\" McCall said. \"I felt really good running it, but the goal is to be physical and wear teams down.\" \nAfter the Irish had a lot of success running the ball on the perimeter with quarterback Jared Faulkner and running backs Hayden Muckensturm and Davonte Herron, it helped set up McCall on the inside. \n\"At the beginning of the game, we wanted to get outside and set up the inside run,\" Yonnotti said. \"Once we made them pay with the outside run, that loosened things up on the inside. In the wing-t, the fullback starts everything and everything else appears as far as the sweeps and the outside stuff.\" \nMuckensturm finished with 103 yards rushing on 15 carries and a touchdown, Faulkner had 70 yards on 10 rushes and Herron added 38 yards on 12 carries and a touchdown. \nOn Fisher Catholic's opening drive, the Irish picked up big chunks of yards on the ground. Herron capped things off with a 2-yard touchdown run to give the Irish a 6-0 lead with 8:57 left in the first quarter. \nThe Irish continued to move the ball, but an interception stopped one drive and a turnover on downs halted another. \nThe Irish were able to get another score right before halftime when Faulkner scrambled for a 26-yard gain. He then hit Parker Brady on a 25-yard touchdown pass to give Fisher Catholic a 12-0 lead with 2:03 left in the half. \nMcCall scored on a pair of 7-yard touchdown runs in the third and fourth quarter. His first one came with 1:27 left in the third quarter, and the second one came with 7:59 left in the game. Faulkner added a 2-point conversion run. \ntwilson@lancastereaglegazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:49:32.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
