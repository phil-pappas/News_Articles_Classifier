(Photo: David Scrivner / Iowa City Press-Citizen) \nWest High was looking for a spark to ignite a late-season district run on Friday night. \nOliver Martin was happy to provide that spark. \nMartin caught a pair of touchdown passes and returned a punt for a touchdown as West High (2-5, 2-0) exploded for a 63-27 win over Dubuque Hempstead (5-2, 1-1) at Trojan Field. \nThe win snapped a five-game Hempstead winning streak and improved West High to 2-5 on the season, and, more importantly, improved the Trojans to 2-0 in Class 4A District 7 play. \n“It feels really good to put a game together,” Martin said. “We are 2-0 in the district now and that’s huge and it gives us a lot of confidence moving forward because they are a 5-1 team and we played to our potential and showed how good we can be.” \nMartin was the spark in a West High offensive explosion on Friday that resulted in a season-high 63 points. \nThe junior receiver hauled in touchdown grabs of 65 and 75 yards and added an impressive 67-yard punt return for a score as West High won for the second time in three games after an 0-4 start. \n“We knew we had it in us, we knew it’s been there and we weren’t perfect tonight either, but tonight we made more plays than we gave up,” West High coach Garrett Hartwig said. “That was the difference.” \nWest High wasted little time getting on the scoreboard Friday. \nJunior Devontae Lane returned the opening kickoff 79 yards for a touchdown to put the Trojans on top just 12 seconds into the game. \nLane picked the ball up off the turf at the 21-yard line, cut up the center of the field and outraced the Mustang coverage team to the end zone. \nIt was off and running for the Trojans from there. \nWest High forced Hempstead to go three-and-out on its first offensive possession. \nOn the Trojans’ second offensive play following the Hempstead punt, Alex Henderson hit Martin wide open down the sideline for a 65-yard touchdown and a 14-0 lead less than four minutes into the game. \n“It gave us a ton of momentum and a ton of confidence that we can play at that high level,” Martin said of the early lead. “That was a big boost.” \nHempstead cut the lead to 14-7 on a Levonta Collins 28-yard touchdown run on its next possession. \nWest High took a 21-7 halftime lead on a 2-yard Mason Carter touchdown run with 48 seconds left in the first half that capped a seven-play, 75-yard drive. \nThe second half started all-Martin and finished all-West High. \nAfter the Mustangs went and three-and-out on their opening possession of the half Martin took a bouncing punt at the 33-yard line, made two defenders miss, cut across the field and outraced two defenders to the end zone for 67-yard touchdown that gave West High a 28-7 lead. \n“I was supposed return to the sideline but when I catch it I just kind of start reacting and going where I see a hole,” Martin said. “It was all kind of a blur, I was just trying to make guys miss.” \nWith West High leading 28-13, Martin caught a short pass, turned it upfield, broke a tackle and went 75 yards for a touchdown that put West High up 35-13. \n“It all goes back to his work ethic,” Hartwig said. “He works harder than anybody and he does a great job of preparing every game. He prepares the same way he plays in games and that’s what makes the difference.” \nHempstead tried once more to answer when Collins scored on a 12-yard pass from Cole Muehring to cut the lead to 35-20 with 4:33 left in the third quarter. \nHowever Yeshuwa Hicks scored on a 5-yard touchdown run on the ensuing Trojan possession and the West High defense slammed the door. \nDonovan Doyle picked off a Muehring pass to set up his own 5-yard touchdown grab and Nick Kean returned an interception 97 yards for a touchdown on the next possession to give the Trojans a 56-20 lead. \n“It was huge for us honestly to be able to play the way that we did,” Doyle said. “We feel like we’ve been playing at a pretty high level recently, it hasn’t necessarily shown on Friday nights, but we put the work in and now we are playing our best football when it counts and that’s what matters.” \nHenderson finished 9-of-17 through the air for 242 yards and three touchdowns, with Martin making five catches for 163 yards. \nHicks had a team-high 76 yards on the ground. \nWest High now faces district road games at Davenport North and Pleasant Valley to end the regular season. \n“At this point in district play it is win and move on and that’s what we did,” Doyle said. “We’ll celebrate tonight then we’ll get back to focusing on Davenport North tomorrow morning.” \nReach Ryan Murken at 319-339-7369 or rmurken@press-citizen.com and follow him on Twitter at @rmmurken. \nHempstead West High", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:04:15.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
