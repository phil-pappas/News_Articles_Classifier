Texas oilman T Boone Pickens hosted a packed luncheon at a posh Dallas venue for Fiorina in late September, while venture capitalist Tom Perkins is planning a fundraising gala in California in the next few months.\n“My money is on her,” said Perkins, who served on HP’s board during Fiorina’s tenure. “I think she could be president.”\nAs the only woman on stage at the 16 September debate, Fiorina emerged as the most effective candidate in taking on frontrunner Donald Trump, chastening the celebrity real-estate magnate for his controversial comments about her looks.\n“The emails have not stopped” since then, said seasoned California political fundraising consultant Karolyn Dorsee, who is working on behalf of Republican presidential candidates including Rubio and former Florida governor Jeb Bush . “Everybody wants her, nationwide, in every single state.”\nEven before her rapid rise in the polls – she has vaulted to second place in the key early voting state of New Hampshire – Fiorina had garnered about $2m in support from the likes of reclusive hedge fund baron Robert Mercer and former Univision chief executive Jerrold Perenchio.\nFiorina’s campaign now appears far less of a long shot than it did over the summer, when she was struggling with sparse crowds, scant name recognition and a coffer of just $5m that put her at the bottom of the money race.\nHer campaign thus far has been a bare-bones operation, relying on a young and relatively low-paid, skeletal staff as opposed to the sprawling operations built by candidates like Bush. Support from the Kochs would change her operation overnight.\n“We think she’s pretty viable,” said broadcasting billionaire Stanley Hubbard, a member of the Koch brothers’ network of conservative advocacy groups who donates heavily to political candidates.\nThe Kochs have been keeping a close eye on Fiorina ever since she announced her candidacy in May, the Koch sources said. They extended an invite to her to speak at their exclusive summit of rich donors at an oceanfront luxury resort in August along with Rubio, Bush, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker – who last month dropped out of the race – and Texas senator Ted Cruz.\nRelated: Jeb Bush locked in battle for mainstream support – and money – with Marco Rubio\nFiorina, the lowest polling candidate at the gathering, impressed the attendees with her mastery of policy detail and heavyweight stage presence.\n“She’s good in the room,” said one participant at the event, who declined to be named.\nThe Fiorina campaign, and the independent fund-raising Super Pac supporting her, declined comment.\nThe Kochs, who own America’s second-largest private company, have backed Fiorina in the past, notably when she ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer for her California US Senate seat in 2010.\nAt the time, the Kochs had helped mount a campaign for Proposition 23, a ballot measure designed to suspend the state law banning higher carbon emissions that was ultimately defeated. Fiorina supported the measure. A Koch Industries Pac helped sponsor a Washington fundraiser for Fiorina at the time and gave $10,000 to her campaign.\nAs Fiorina’s money problems fade, some high-dollar donors are considering doubling down. Dallas philanthropist Elloine Clark has so far written one $100,000 check to the Super Pac supporting Fiorina. She says she may give more.\n“I think she’s unflappable,” said Clark. “And she doesn’t react like an adolescent.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T00:19:21.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
