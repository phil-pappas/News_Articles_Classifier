EAST RUTHERFORD — The last chance slipped right through Cole Beasley’s fingers.\nThe muffed punt deflected off his hands, off the MetLife Stadium turf and right into the waiting arms of a leaping Giant, Myles White. The clock read: 1:26. The scoreboard read: Giants 27, Cowboys 20.\nFinally it was over.\nPhotos:  Giants beat the Cowboys 27-20 with a late game kickoff return \nFinally the Giants had exorcised the demons of Monday night’s ugly, 20-point loss to Philadelphia, which hovered over them the past six days.\nFinally the Giants made big plays in the second half this season. They intercepted Dallas quarterback Matt Cassel on three straight possessions — two by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, including one he returned for a 58-yard touchdown. And then came the big blow, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris’ 100-yard kickoff return with 7:01 remaining, providing the winning margin.\nAnd finally, for the first time in six tries, for the first time since 2012, the Giants had beaten the archrival Cowboys.\n“We wanted it bad,” said coach Tom Coughlin, who joined Steve Owen as the only coaches to reach 100 regular-season victories with the Giants.\n“We really didn’t have a choice,” said receiver Rueben Randle, referring to last week’s loss to the Eagles and the season-opening defeat at Dallas.\nAnd along the way, maybe this Giants team (4-3) found its identity as it also finds itself in first place in the NFC East.\n“They’re fighters,” Coughlin said. “They’re scrappy. We’re gritty and scrappy. That’s what we describe ourselves as, and they are.\n“They battle and fight.”\nThe Giants avenged their season-opening loss to Dallas by making big plays and winning the turnover battle, 4-0.\nRodgers-Cromartie’s first interception in the third quarter was one of the biggest. He high-stepped most of the way to the end zone with his right hand raised above his head to give the Giants a 17-13 lead. Brandon Meriweather then intercepted a pass on the next Cowboys drive at the Giants’ 1, outleaping a once-open Terrance Williams.\nThen, after Dallas tied the game, 20-20, on Devin Street’s 25-yard touchdown reception from Cassel with 7:14 remaining, Harris came through against his former teammates.Harris’ return tied the franchise record for the longest, held by Emlen Tunnell (1951) and Clarence Childs (1964).\nWhite’s fumble recovery sealed the victory.\nBut as Coughlin said, “It wasn’t pretty.”\nAnd it wasn’t. The Giants remain a deeply flawed team. They barely beat the Cowboys (2-4), who still are without the injured Tony Romo and Dez Bryant.\nOnce again there was no Giants pass rush. Dallas chewed up their defense for 233 net rushing yards. And the offense again looked out of sync, with Odell Beckham Jr. catching only four passes for 35 yards, Eli Manning throwing for only 170 yards and the offensive line again looking overmatched at times.\nBut it was a complete victory.\nThe Giants handled Cassel in his first Cowboys start in place of Brandon Weeden, who was 0-3 filling in for Romo. The defense held Dallas on their final drive.\nThe Giants broke their streak of seven straight games without reaching 100 rushing yards, gaining 132.\nAnd it was the first time they scored touchdowns on offense, defense and via kickoff return since Nov. 4, 1951.\nBut more importantly, the Giants beat the Cowboys at MetLife for the first time since Week 17 of the 2011 season, gaining a measure of revenge for that final-seconds heartbreaker to Dallas in the opener.\n“We’re a scrappy bunch,” linebacker Jon Beason said.\n“It means we’re not going to stop, no matter what,” Randle said.\nRodgers-Cromartie — who returned a fumble 57 yards in the opener — became the first Giants player with an interception and fumble return for touchdowns of more than 50 yards in the same season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:04:48.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
