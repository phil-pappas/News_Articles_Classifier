That&#8217s the thoughts-set that we have.&quot\nFowler was noticeably sharp in Saturday&#8217s scrimmages, as have been forwards Ryan Kesler and Jakob Silfverberg. For Fowler, at his sixth Ducks instruction camp, trying to get a fast jump is a deliberate modify. It&#8217s significant, too, that he&#8217s top by example and willing to be a sturdy if soft voice on the ice and off.\n&quotThis year I worked particularly really hard in the summer time to make positive I was ready for these first days of camp,&quot he said. &quotIn the previous years I would kind of take camp to slowly perform my way into points, but I didn&#8217t want to do that this year. I wanted to come in right from the start out and feel like I was in midseason type.\n&quotThere&#8217s obviously items I can continue to do to increase, but I feel great correct now and the group as a whole looks fantastic. The pace is actually quickly out there and guys are competing and you need that attitude suitable away, right now, if we want to get to where we want to be late in the playoffs.&quot\nFowler played nicely final spring, collecting two ambitions, ten points and a plus-5 defensive rating in 16 games, and he hopes to develop on that this season.\n&#8220I gained a lot of self-assurance from my play in the playoffs last year. I type of proved to myself that when it came down to crunch time and the group required some thing to come about I felt like I was there. I just felt like my game elevated a small bit in the playoffs,&#8221 he stated.\n&#8220These last couple of seasons I&#8217ve had a lot to find out, but I usually feel like I have far more to give, and so I came in this season definitely prepared to just try and be the greatest I can be for my teammates. I just have a little diverse attitude than I&#8217ve had the final couple years. It&#8217s tough to explain but I feel like it&#8217s my time to show what I can do and be 1 of the leaders, in particular on the back end. That&#8217s all I&#8217m focused on performing correct now.&#8221\nUncomplicated as three-on-three\nThe scrimmage incorporated 3-on-3 play, aspect of the group&#8217s preparation for the new overtime format that will be in effect this season. It was quickly and exciting — and strange to see when they skated on the Olympic-size ice surface, which is 15 feet wider than NHL specifications.\nFowler, an great skater, looked comfortable in the 3-on-three format but stated absolutely everyone will need to have time to adjust.\n&#8220You&#8217re going to see teams focused on puck possession as the principal point. There were instances out there exactly where you maybe didn&#8217t have a play when you got into the offensive zone and at those instances, even if you have to bring it back all the way to your personal finish or pass it to the goalie, you don&#8217t want to give up the puck possession three-on-3 since it&#8217s tough to get the puck back if it gets turned more than,&#8221 he mentioned. &#8220Then you can see if you go down and take a shot and miss the net there could be a three-on-a single, two-on-one particular the other way. So there&#8217s a lot of factors that come into play and I&#8217m positive we&#8217ll get some a lot more practice on it so we can find out what to do and what not to do in that predicament.&#8221\nSilfverberg said he enjoys the new format, which was adopted in hopes of resolving games ahead of they went to a shootout.\n&quotIt&#8217s a lot of space but I like it. I believe it opens up to finish in overtime,&quot he stated. &quotYou&#8217ve got to make certain you play man-on-man. You can&#8217t let your guy go because that opens up a lot. I assume the players are going to love it. I assume the fans are going to appreciate it. I believe it&#8217s a fantastic modify.&quot\nCoach Bruce Boudreau mentioned he and his employees are formulating how they will method three-on-3 play and stated each and every group probably is figuring out its best three-man combinations.\n&quotOn Olympic ice, it was pretty wide open. You can see that ambitions are going to happen,&quot he stated. &quotIf some team gets a break, the other group is getting a break. If you don&#8217t score on our possibilities, you&#8217re going to be in problems… We assume we&#8217ve got some guys that are truly great skaters and are going to genuinely like the open ice and they can deal with the puck so it may be exciting.&quot\nNotes\nDefenseman Clayton Stoner (upper-physique injury) sat out for the second straight day. Boudreau stated Stoner is about 3 or 4 days away from getting able to participate in camp.\nAdhere to Helene Elliott on Twitter @helenenothelen\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-ducks-training-camp-20150919-story.html"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:06:17.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
