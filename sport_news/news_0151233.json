That’s the good thing about having the CFL app on your phone. That’s a plug.” \nSome commentators, such as this one, suggested several weeks ago that the Roughriders — who are now the owners of a league-worst 2-11 record — pull the plug on this season. \nThe players and coaches do not subscribe to that pessimistic line of thinking, and instead aspire to become the first team to make the CFL playoffs following an 0-9 start. \nAnd those hopes are not completely dashed, due to the presence of three other sub-.500 teams — the Montreal Alouettes (5-7), B.C. Lions (4-8) and Winnipeg Blue Bombers (4-9) — in the CFL’s tortoise race. \nThe Roughriders can enhance their playoff chances by winning Saturday in Vancouver. But even if the Roughriders taste defeat yet again this weekend, they will not be mathematically eliminated from post-season contention. \nSo here it sits. October has arrived and the Roughriders are still talking, dreamily, about playoff possibilities. With that in mind, Glenn was asked if it was surprising that a two-win team could still entertain such notions. \n“It’s so funny, but that’s the nature of the CFL,” he replied with typical good cheer. “And the way that the league is going right now, it’s a possibility that this can happen. \n“I was talking to my father the other day and he said, ‘What a story it would be if it would end the right way.’ And that way is with us doing what we need to do to get into the playoffs and fighting for that spot.” \nTo have any chance of making the playoffs, the Roughriders have to win at least four of their final five regular-season games. Complicating matters, four of those games are on the road, where Saskatchewan has not won in more than a year. \nEven if the Roughriders enjoy a torrid late-season resurgence, they will need Montreal, Winnipeg and B.C. to experience sluggish finishes for Saskatchewan’s storybook finish to materialize. \nBut Glenn, ever optimistic and upbeat, refuses to rule out the improbable. \n“The guys who have been in the league have seen a lot of these things that have happened throughout the years here,” said Glenn, who made his CFL debut with the 2001 Roughriders. \n“An 8-and-10 Calgary Stampeders team in 2001 wins the Grey Cup, and they had four of those eight wins against one team (Saskatchewan). They barely got in, I think, in the last game of the season. \n“We’ve seen a lot go on in this league, so we understand, and we can take some of those scenarios and play them to what’s going on right now and kind of tell the guys, ‘Look, it is a real fighting chance for us to do this.’ \n“John (Chick) has been saying it. I’ve been saying it. Other veteran guys have been saying it too. We’re trying to drill it into the young guys’ heads and into everybody in here so we continue to keep believing.” \nSuch is the mantra in Riderville. \n“Everyone’s doing a good job of continuing to believe,” receiver Rob Bagg said. “It would be easy to quit on each other right now, but no one’s doing that in our locker room. We’re fighting day-to-day to stay alive and we’ve got a great opportunity this weekend.” \nFollowed by an app-ortunity, one presumes, when Glenn checks his smartphone. \nrvanstone@leaderpost.com \nTwitter.com/robvanstone", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:45:06.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
