This lawsuit does not prevent STP from pursuing claims under the terms of the design-build contract,” WSDOT said in a statement.\n“Taking action to preserve WSDOT’s rights in court was a necessary step. Our focus remains on completing the project, and removing the seismically vulnerable Alaskan Way Viaduct. We intend to ask for a stay of WSDOT’s lawsuit until the project is completed and asked STP to join us in this request.”\nWSDOT staff says the action is to protect the interests of Washington taxpayers.\nThe lawsuit will allow for work on the State Route 99 Tunnel Project to be completed before litigation takes place, according to WSDOT.\nThe filing comes after the announcement that WSDOT says it expects to lose $78 million because the machine digging the tunnel to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct in Seattle broke down.\nThe $78 million cost reflects extra spending on administrators, engineers, consulting firms and office space as a two-year delay because of continuing problems with the Bertha tunnel-boring machine.\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
