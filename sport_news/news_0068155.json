Back-to-back Devonte Mays runs leaves #USU with a 3rd and 1 at the BSU 2 yard line. Aggies stuffed bringing up 4th down. — Tim Olsen (@TheRealTO) October 17, 2015 Aggies go for it on 4th and 1, Myers to Houston for 6. https://t.co/JHI2T5eFm3 — Matthew L Glade (@matthewLksl) October 17, 2015 \nA quick Broncos' three-and-out then set the Aggies up near midfield, and they were able to move the ball just enough to get in position for kicker Jason Thompson. Jake Thompson hammers a 51-yard field goal. That thing was way up there. — Bronco Beat (@IDS_BroncoBeat) October 17, 2015 Jake Thompson Ladies & Gents!! \" @efrandsen : Wowzers! It's g d\"< /p>— AggrizzlyFan (@aggrizzly) October 17, 2015 \nDefensive End Ali'ifua introduced himself to Boise State quarterback Brett Rypien on the visitors' next possession. Sack. Fumble. Aggies ball. < a href=\"https://t.co/OLGeIqFI4K\">https://t.co/OLGeIqFI4K — Matthew L Glade (@matthewLksl) October 17, 2015 \nKyler Fackrell jumped on the fumble forced by Ali'ifua, and three plays later Myers connected with Hunter Sharp to put Utah State up two touchdowns. Aggies capitalize, Myers to Sharp TD https://t.co/tymKBZbFDA — Matthew L Glade (@matthewLksl) October 17, 2015 TD for Hunter \"Ain't nobody more\" Sharp! @Hunter_A_Sharp — Don Larson (@Aggie_PT) October 17, 2015 \nThe turnover that set up the score turned out to be an omen of things to come, as Nick Vigil blew past his blocker and forced another fumble on his sack of Rypien. Nick Vigil!!! Let's go!!!! #goaggies https://t.co/fiecvOAdQW< /a>< /p>— Brendan Dennis (@B_Den1) October 17, 2015 \nUtah State needed four plays to cash in on the takeaway, with Hunt making his way through the line of scrimmage. Uh oh, Boise State. Utah State scores again on a 4-yard TD run from LaJuan Hunt. Aggies lead 24-3 early in the second quarter. — Dr. Saturday (@YahooDrSaturday) October 17, 2015 LaJuan Hunt's turn; 24-3 Aggies https://t.co/rZmDU1wLov — Matthew L Glade (@matthewLksl) October 17, 2015 \nBoise State moved the ball better on its next drive, but it was for naught when Torrey Green picked off Rypien. — Brendan Dennis (@B_Den1) October 17, 2015 \nThe Aggies squandered the turnover. Yet again, the Broncos gave the ball back before Jalen Davis perhaps tried to do a little too much on his interception return. Big break here for Boise State. Rypien is intercepted but Utah State's Jalen Davis fumbles on the INT return. pic.twitter.com/XItuyfB4m9 — Dr. Saturday (@YahooDrSaturday) October 17, 2015 \nBoise State cashed in to make it 24-10 and looked like it was on the way to making it close after a Utah State three-and-out. \nInstead, Aggies' safety Marwin Evans and Vigil combined to record their fifth forced turnover of the half. Devan Demas hit hard by Marwin Evans and fumbles, Nick Vigil recovers and #USU takes over at BSU 46-yard line w/2:09 left in the half. — Tim Olsen (@TheRealTO) October 17, 2015 \nAnd the Broncos, like Colorado State and Frenso State before them, quickly learned what happens when Myers finds his way into open field. Aggies rolling, another turnover leads to a Kent Myers td https://t.co/6GZbULJ4Uj — Matthew L Glade (@matthewLksl) October 17, 2015 Kent Myers put on the boosties. Huge TD for the Aggies! — Tom Marvolo Riddle (@charleyriddle) October 17, 2015 \nOn the other side of the ball, Utah State continued to make a hot offense coming in look bad. During a four-game winning streak before coming to Utah State, Boise outscored Idaho State, Virginia, Hawaii and Colorado State, 204-24. — Steve Luhm (@sluhm) October 17, 2015 Yet another turnover as Fackrell forces a fumble and Hayes recovers it at the BSU 21. ... Play is under review. — Utah State Football (@USUFootball) October 17, 2015 \nIt's safe to say those at Maverik Stadium who traveled from Idaho weren't enjoying themselves. Checking in on Boise State fans... pic.twitter.com/iNqoodwhEA — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) October 17, 2015 \nAnd on the play following the fumble, Sharp came down with Myers' throw in the back of the end zone. Hunter Sharp's TD made it 38-10 in the 2nd. https://t.co/5adiq6SWQ8 — Matthew L Glade (@matthewLksl) October 17, 2015 WHAT. A. FREAKING. CATCH. NO WORDS. Sharp TD puts Utah State up 38-10 1:05 left in the half. (After the PAT, Play under review) — Parker Robertson (@ParkerRob78) October 17, 2015 \nThe Aggies hadn't even put the exclamation point on the first half until Evans intercepted Rypien on the last play before halftime. The Aggies top off an absolutely dominant 1st half with a Marwin Evans pick 6 https://t.co/1PEfnPPupc — Matthew L Glade (@matthewLksl) October 17, 2015 I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. Please don't wake me up. — Jonny Floyd (@JN_Floyd) October 17, 2015 \nHalftime finally came for the Broncos after they committed seven turnovers. Utah State had 45 points through two quarters – more of a basketball score for some. Could Utah State beat the Sixers? — Dr. Saturday (@YahooDrSaturday) October 17, 2015 @TomFornelli I tried to carry them out but they just kept turning over. — Schadenfreude Sports (@SchadenfreudeSN) October 17, 2015 \nAll smiles for Aggies fans at the break.
