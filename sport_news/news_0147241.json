Either way, he would not have gotten in the way of the man arguing with an official farther down the sideline. \nEmmitt Smith was emotionally into Saturday night’s 38-10 win against Ole Miss. Meanwhile, McElwain was into having Smith on the sideline, back with the Gators. \n“Shoot guys, I was like a kid in a candy store,” McElwain said. “I actually got to shake Emmitt Smith’s hand, that was pretty neat, you know. That means a lot.” \nSmith’s rare appearance in Gainesville was a ringing endorsement of the direction of Florida football under McElwain. \nSmith’s frustration boiled over when quarterback Jeff Driskel threw three interceptions during last September’s blowout loss at Alabama. Smith tweeted, \"put Driskel on the bench please, I've seen enough.” \nSmith, who rushed for 224 yards against the Crimson Tide in his first start at Florida, later apologized. But it was clear one of the program’s best players and NFL’s all-time leading rusher wanted change. \nSmith’s appearance last Saturday left effusive defensive end Alex McCalister speechless. \n“I was getting dressed and I just had happened to turn right and Emmitt Smith is sitting down right there,” McCalister recalled. “My heart dropped for a second. I was like, ‘Dawg, Emmitt Smith is really right here in our locker room just chillin’.” \nTailback Kelvin Taylor said it was special to get advice and feedback from a player who set the standard at Florida. \n“It was pretty cool just him out there on the sideline telling me when I made a good cut,” Taylor said. “It doesn’t really get no better than that.\" \nMcElwain agreed. \n“I was a little giddy,” he said. “I had a chance to meet one of the best ever at his position. Never would have thought that would happen.” \nEmail Edgar Thompson at egthompson@orlandosentinel.com . Read the Swamp Things blog at www.orlandosentinel.com/swampthings .
