(STEPHEN DUNN / Hartford Courant) Lori Riley Contact Reporter \nWINDSOR — When Pam Hammersmith and Dee Stephan took over as co-coaches of the Windsor field hockey team six years ago, the Warriors had won one game the year before and there almost weren't enough players for a varsity team. \n\"The first couple years, we barely fielded a varsity team, and no JVs,\" said Hammersmith, the former Simsbury coach who has been the lone Windsor head coach the past four years. \"The first three years, some days we would have a JV [team] and some days we wouldn't. That was sort of frustrating. They were learning the game at the varsity level and you cannot learn the game at varsity level.\" \nWindsor won two games her first year, four her second. One the next year. Two after that. Last year, the Warriors again won four games, including an overtime victory over South Windsor in the last game of the season. \n\"When we beat South Windsor in that last game, they played tremendously,\" Hammersmith said. \"I was watching them and thinking, 'Wow, it's about time.' I think they finally came into this season believing they could do it.\" \n\"It just turned a switch for the team,\" senior forward Morgan Hanks said. \nHanks is one of a group of seniors who has played for four years. So far, Windsor has won as many games as it did all of last season and has a record of 4-1-1. The Warriors beat Southington, Hall, East Catholic and Stafford and tied E.O. Smith Tuesday 1-1. Their only loss came to Farmington. They scored four goals against Stafford, which still shocks Hammersmith a bit. \nWindsor and E.O. Smith tied 1-1 in field hockey at Windsor High School on Tuesday, Sept. 29. \n\"There were times I don't think we scored four goals in a season,\" she said. \nWindsor has had success in the past in the sport, but it's been a while. The Warriors won the Class L title in 1987. In 2002, former coach Dominique Fox brought the team to the Class L semifinal, where it lost to a powerhouse Pomperaug team, 6-1. The Warriors made it to the state tournament in 2003 and 2006, where they lost both times in the first round. They haven't been back since. \nStephan and Hammersmith decided to team up in 2010 to revive the struggling program. Stephan left after two years, but Hammersmith, who won more than 300 games and four state co-championships during her 25-year coaching tenure at Simsbury, stayed. She left coaching at Simsbury in 2008 but she still teaches at the high school. \nInitially, they were teaching players skills, like the proper way to hold a stick. Now that there are 30 kids in the program and a number of returning players who have played for two or three years, Hammersmith is able to work on higher-level skills and game situations. \n\"The first week of practice this year, we started going into drills that we would have done toward the end of the season last year,\" Hanks said. \"That was a big step.\" \nSenior midfielder Madison Lee was a typical Windsor player: she had never heard of field hockey before her mom encouraged her to go out for the sport to do something different her freshman year. She started varsity as a freshman and learned as she went. That's tough against other CCC teams like Class L co-champion Glastonbury, Simsbury and Farmington. Those programs generally have a core of players who — for the most part — have played longer, gone to camps to improve in the summer, and play outside the season. Two of Windsor's players went to camp this summer. \n\"We have a really good relationship as a team this year,\" Lee said. \"I think that's the root of our success so far.\" \nWindsor's core group of seniors — Lee, Hanks and Maddy Carroll — hung in there through the lopsided losses and tough seasons. They still don't have a lot of subs on varsity —\"I don't think I've gotten a sub since my sophomore year,\" Carroll said — but there is a JV team and the younger kids are learning the sport earlier at a different level. They play some games on the school's artificial turf field but they don't practice there and many of their games are still played on the grass field. \nAnd now Windsor believes it can win. \n\"We were tied against Southington in our first game,\" Hammersmith said. \"It was on turf. We had no subs. It was 90 degrees. But these kids didn't quit and we put it [a goal in] in the second half and won the game. Where in years past, they were like, 'We're supposed to lose, so let's just lose.' \n\"That's a huge difference — that they believe in themselves.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T14:23:50.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
