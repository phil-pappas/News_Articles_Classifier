HOWARD BOGAN) \nWith Hurricane Joaquin barreling up the coast, it doesn't look like any boats will be making the trek offshore for tuna, unless the storm's trajectory suddenly changes. \n\"I guarantee this Sunday's trip is not going. I may have to open another date for the guys who signed up for that trip,\" said Capt. Rich Falcone of the Golden Eagle. \nEven before this storm's approach, the pattern of strong and steady east winds made canyon fishing nearly impossible. There were a lot of canceled trips but party boats were able to take advantage of some brief weather windows to get out. \nFalcone returned Monday from an overnight trip with a catch of yellowfin and mahi-mahi from the Hudson Canyon. They also battled several bigeye tuna that they were not able to get into the boat. \nTwo anglers with their tuna Art Haluska of Edison (left) with his two bigeye tuna.

Six reels were spooled, two we stopped and we had one on for a good 45 minutes before the hook pulled,\" Falcone said. \nThe 125-foot Jamaica sailed twice and according to the boat's skipper, anglers had plenty of opportunity to land fish. \nOn the first trip to the Hudson Canyon, Capt. Howard Bogan said the action began almost immediately. As soon as they set up for tuna at sunset an angler hooked into a swordfish. That fish however, was able to slip the hook and was lost at the boat. \nAfter that they missed a few tuna until Frank Pogue of Willingboro hooked into and landed a 140-pound bigeye tuna. Pogue would later land a 55-pound longfin tuna. FISHING: Fluke out, fall stripers and bluefish in \nBogan said the tuna came and went under the boat all night and the bite would turn on from time to time. The best bite was around 4 a.m. when he said they had multiple hook-ups. There were a few smaller tuna in the mix but most weighed from 50 to 70 pounds. \nChris \"Smitty\" Smith, a long time captain and deckhand at Bogan's Basin, came up from Naples, Florida for some fresh tuna and was rewarded with a 70-pound yellowfin and a 56-pound longfin. \nOn the second trip Boagn said they had fish under the boat and biting for 3 hours on one drift. \n\"There were thousands of skipjacks with yellowfin and longfin mixed in,\" said Bogan. \nThey tied into a few more bigeye tuna on the trip but were not able to boat them. \nDan Radel: 732-643-4072; dradel@GannettNJ.com Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1Rka9AR Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:29:06.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
