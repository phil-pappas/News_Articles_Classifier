The Lightning, the highest-scoring scoring team in the league last season, have managed just 2 goals over their last four games against the Hawks. Corey Crawford (21 saves) didn't have to do a whole lot Saturday, but he has nonetheless stopped 101 of 103 shots since the start of Game 4 of the NHL Final for an amazing .981 save percentage. Jonathan Toews scored the game's only goal, 17 seconds into overtime as the Hawks improved to 5-3-0. This year, only Montreal and Washington are scoring more goals per game than Tampa Bay, but the Lightning just can't solve Crawford. \"The thing that impresses me is that when you start reeling off the top goaltenders in the league, nobody ever mentions him,\" Cooper said. \"Yet, he's the guy who wins all the time.\" Yahoo! ranked the top goalies in the league before the season and had Montreal's Carey Price, Nashville's Pekka Rinne, the Rangers' Henrik Lundqvist and Boston's Tukka Rask as the top four. Crawford was ninth. \"So, I don't know how you rate goaltenders, but I want the guy who's going to win,\" Cooper continued. \"And I don't think you can put a price tag on that. \"To have that guy backstop your team, and clearly they have a team that has the utmost confidence in him, it's a pretty lethal combination to have and they've proven it over the last half a decade here.\" Tampa Bay's Kristers Gudlevskis made 31 saves in just his second NHL start. The Hawks continued to play impressive team defense without Duncan Keith. They allowed just 39 combined shots on against Florida and Tampa Bay the last two games. The Lightning managed just 21, which is incredible when you consider they had four power-play opportunities. \"Most teams have one or two lines you have to be concerned with,\" Hawks coach Joel Quenneville said before the game. \"(Tampa Bay) is deeper and they have a real active back end so it's going to be an ongoing challenge tonight. It'll be a good test for some of our young defensemen as well.\" They certainly passed with flying colors once again. The next test comes Monday when the reeling Anaheim Ducks come to down in a rematch of the Western Conference finals. The Ducks are 1-5-1 and have scored just 6 goals in seven games.
