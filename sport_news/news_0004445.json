PHILADELPHIA – The Devils are optimistic right wing Kyle Palmieri will be fine for the start of the regular season after the Montvale native sustained an unspecified injury Wednesday night in the second period of their 4-2 preseason win over the Flyers.\nWith Philadelphia forward Scott Laughton pressuring him from behind, Palmieri’s legs buckled and he fell awkwardly into the end boards in the Flyers’ zone 3:16 into the second period.\n\"He’s just got a little minor tweak right now, [and] we just didn’t want to have him to finish the game,\" Devils coach John Hynes said. \"We just had him rest up there a little bit.\"\nHynes added that \"as of now\" he does not believe Palmieri is in danger of missing the regular-season opener against Winnipeg a week from Friday.\n\"But, we have to figure out more after we talk to the trainers and stuff like that,\" Hynes said.\nIt was unclear if Laughton caused Palmieri’s legs to come out from under him, but Palmieri appeared unhappy with Laughton and yelled at him as he left the ice. Palmieri was unavailable to speak to the media after the game.\nThe Devils can little afford to lose for Palmieri with it all but certain that Patrik Elias will begin the regular season on injured reserve because of a sore right knee. A final decision has yet to be made on Elias, but general manager Ray Shero expressed apprehension Wednesday about playing the 39-year-old left wing in the opener with no practice time so far in training camp and without playing in any preseason games.\n\"He’s skated a couple times on his own, but that’s it,\" Shero said.\nPalmieri, who was acquired in a draft-day trade with Anaheim, has been having a strong preseason and set up Adam Henrique’s power-play goal that tied the game a 2 at 2:05 of the second period. Palmieri had hit the left post with a one-timer from the left circle seconds earlier and this time he made it look like he was taking another slap shot, and instead passed in front to Henrique for the redirection in behind goaltender Michal Neuvirth.\n\"It was a great play,\" Henrique said. \"That’s something we’ve worked on through camp. We’ve got a lot of new systems, so we’ve been slowly working on one thing after another and that was part of it. We needed a bounce back after the second half of the first period and I think we came out strong in the second, drew a penalty and I think that was a great play.\n\"I think everybody touched in on that play, so it was a heads-up play by him.\"\nThe Devils were giving Palmieri a look at the left point on the power play Wednesday night, and he was looked comfortable there. Unfortunately, he was injured on his next shift.\n\"Hopefully, it’s nothing serious,\" Henrique said. \"Hopefully, it’s a day or two. Fortunately enough, we’ve got one [preseason] game left and we still have a little bit of time before opening night, so, hopefully, we’ll get everybody back and we’ll be healthy for the first game.\"\nBRIEFS: Travis Zajac scored with 2:33 left in the second period to snap a 2-2 tie and added an empty-net goal with 31.8 seconds left to clinch it for the Devils. … Tuomo Ruutu also scored. Damon Severson and Jacob Josefson had two assists apiece.\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:43:37.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
