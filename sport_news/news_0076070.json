The senior forward scored two goals early in the first half to put Nazareth out in front. \nJunior defender Holly Lunt , freshman goalkeeper Caitlyn Lazzarini and the rest of the Blue Eagles' defense took care of everything else, assuring a 2-0 road win over Central Catholic on Thursday. \n\"I think we started off kind of rough. We got the two goals, picked it up and as we got the momentum, we carried it,\" Lunt said. \"I think we talked well on defense. I had my outside backs marking with me and I think it really worked out. A couple games we were kind of struggling with that and having someone open all the time. But they really worked well with me today and that way I was free and I didn't really have to mark so I could get it out easy.\" \nThe Blue Eagles' back line limited the number of shots the Vikings were able to get off. But when Central Catholic did fire one towards the net, Lazzarini was there to put a stop to it. The freshman had four saves and was big for the Blue Eagles in the first few minutes when the Vikings were charging at the Nazareth net. \n\"They executed the game plan. I thought it was working very early,\" Central Catholic coach Steve Gorski said. \"We had a good three or four opportunities in front of net. Their goalkeeper does a great job. She did a great job on those opportunities.\" \nIt was a great performance by the defense, especially considering their experience level. \n\"It was a total team effort,\" Nazareth coach Ziggy Lewis said. \"Defense has been doing really well. We have a young defense, a freshman goalkeeper, a freshman center back (Allison Hoff).\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:22:01.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
