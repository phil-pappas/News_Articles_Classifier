But given that coach Stuart Lancaster’s side needs to build for the future, it was ironic that another hat trick was scored by No. 8 Nick Easter, the 37-year-old veteran who was a TV commentator the previous weekend. \nRight winger Anthony Watson chipped in with a try early on in each half and outside center Henry Slade also scored one in England’s haul of 10. \nThe 10th was a penalty try awarded by referee Chris Pollock right on the final buzzer. \nEngland’s fans inside the City of Manchester Stadium did their best to lift their players’ spirits, with a passionate rendition of “God Save the Queen” and warm applause for the players as they did a lap of honor. \nIt will all feel like scant consolation. \nIn weeks to come, the talk will still be why England lost 33-13 to Australia at Twickenham last Saturday, a week after losing 28-25 to Wales at the same ground. Those defeats have cast doubts over the future of Lancaster, whose team selections were often contested. \nThere has been no such friction in Uruguay’s happy camp. \nLinking arms and heads held high, Uruguay’s players bellowed out their country’s national anthem, chests bursting with pride. \nIt seemed to work - if only briefly - as Uruguay took a second-minute lead through flyhalf Felipe Berchesi. \nBut with only four semi-professional players in their side, it was always a mismatch and they fought a totally rearguard action after that. \nWhen Uruguay’s part-timers fly back home, most will go back to their day jobs. \nFor England’s professionals, they have to find a way to improve at theirs. \nAfter Uruguay’s surprise lead, England hit back as Slade - one of eight changes to the side - aimed a floating kick down the right and Watson used his pace to get on the end of it. Pollock awarded it after a quick video referral showed that Watson grounded it just in time. \nBut England’s new-look team struggled to make an impression, typified by sloppy handling errors, and it was left to an old hand to steady the nerves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:03:01.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
