Tue, 10/06/2015 - 4:40pm Tweet With the NFL trade deadline approaching -- this year, it’s set for Nov. 3 at 4 p.m. -- and the Patriots already making moves to address some issues on the defensive side of the ball, who are they most likely to swing a deal with between now and the first week of November? We put together a quick list of Bill Belichick’s favorite trade partners this past offseason , but we figured with the deals New England has made since the start of camp, it’s time to update that database with an eye toward trying to narrow which teams Belichick might be inclined to call between now and the deadline. When it comes to in-season trades, as we noted here , the Patriots have been pretty aggressive in recent years, as deals during the season netted them Aqib Talib , Jonathan Casillas and Akeem Ayers. When Belichick was asked earlier this week if New England has been “a little more active in the in-season trade market” as of late, he agreed with the assessment, noting the contributions of the aforementioned trio. “It’s worked out that way,” Belichick acknowledged. “We felt like we could make some moves that would help us, obviously, and we’ll see how it all turns out. We felt some players that we’ve acquired – all those guys you mentioned – at the time we did it we thought they would be beneficial for us and they’d be productive for us. “I don’t think it’s been any, like a big conscious effort on our part, like ‘This is what we’ve got to do,’” he added. “[But] we haven’t been afraid to trade here through the years, whether it be during the draft or preseason or regular season or whatever it is” To that point, since he took control of the Patriots in 2000, Belichick has made 111 trades. In all, he’s made the most deals with Oakland (9), followed by Chicago (8), New Orleans and Green Bay (7). Next, it’s Houston, Denver and Tampa Bay (6) followed by Baltimore and Philly (5). Would Belichick be inclined to go back and revisit some old friends in hopes of bolstering his roster between now and the first week of November? It wouldn't be a surprise. When it comes to targeting potential trade partners over the next month, Philadelphia, Houston and Tampa Bay all remain the likeliest candidates for a few reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they all have people in high places who have ties to Belichick. While most of the deals between Belichick and the Eagles were made when Andy Reid was coaching there, current Philly coach Chip Kelly and Belichick have a well-established relationship dating back to Kelly’s time at Oregon. The relationship runs even deeper between Belichick and the Texans, as Houston has connections on several levels, including head coach Bill O’Brien, defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel and assistant coaches Mike Vrabel , Anthony Pleasant and George Godsey. If there’s another AFC team who might be the most inclined to swing a deal with the Patriots at this point, it’s likely the Texans. (We’ll take the Broncos out of the mix here, as most of the deals between Belichick and Denver happened when Josh McDaniels or Belichick’s buddy Mike Shanahan were in charge with the Broncos .) And then, there’s Tampa Bay. The Patriots and Bucs have never been shy about making a non-traditional swap any time of the year: New England acquired Talib from the Bucs in the middle of the season, and the Logan Mankins trade took place just before the start of the 2014 schedule. (The Patriots also picked up LeGarrette Blount from Tampa during draft weekend in 2013.) Bucs GM Jason Licht made his bones in the Patriots’ front office, working three years in New England, and that makes him as good a trade partner as any for the Patriots. One potential wild card? New Orleans. It’s clear that the Saints have become a favorite as of late -- the Patriots have pulled off a pair of deals with New Orleans since the start of training camp, and Belichick and Saints coach Sean Payton remain good friends. While New Orleans is still on the fringes of the postseason chase, if they struggle to get back to .500 over the course of the next month, New England might be inclined to give them a call to try and pull off another trade. And don't discount the Bears, who have shown a willingness to deal with the Patriots in the past, and are apparently in the midst of a fire sale after a slow start . For the record, it’s important to note that Belichick has not made a deal with the Raiders since the death of Al Davis in October 2011. This is not to suggest the Patriots and Oakland wouldn’t be inclined to try and trade again; only to say that when it comes to making a deal, it’s unlikely the Raiders are a go-to spot going forward. It’s also worth noting that the two teams we do know who are likely off Belichick’s trade radar are the Colts and Jets. While New York received compensation for losing Belichick to the Patriots in 2000, since he arrived in New England, Belichick has not made a personnel swap with either Indy or the Jets. In the end, while it’s convenient to lean on history when it comes to predicting the Patriots’ next move, the only thing we know for sure is that they rarely follow the script when it comes to the traditional team-building approach. Ultimately, if they can find a midseason trade partner (or partners) that can provide with a similar boost to the one they got in 2014, as far as they’re concerned, that’s all that really matters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:42:26.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
