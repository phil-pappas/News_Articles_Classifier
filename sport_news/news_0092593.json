Just so happens, this week his is a princess.\"\nAs of Wednesday night, the post had more than 24,000 shares and climbing. It was highlighted in stories on the Web , and Henson said he's gotten messages about it from outlets, people and radio stations around the world.\nLike most parents on Facebook, Henson posts regularly about his son, he said.\n\"For this one instance to be blown up is unreal,\" he said.\nCommenters on the post and on sites where the story has gone viral commend Henson as a father for allowing his son to bust gender stereotypes.\nHenson said Caiden was starting to second-guess his costume choice when kids at school teased him, saying it was for girls. But his father reassured and encouraged him to stick with what he really wanted.\nWhile Henson is grateful for the kind words - and shrugs off the not-so-nice - he said he's been surprised that his parenting is newsworthy.\n\"It's weird that being a good parent, and encouraging your son to be imaginative, is rewarded,\" he said. \"It should be second nature.\"\nAnd Henson plans to dress up as Anna from the movie while he takes Caiden trick-or-treating.\n\"We're just going to go have fun with it,\" he said. \"I'm not worried at all about the looks I'll get.\"\nKatherine Hafner, 757-446-2705, katherine.hafner@pilotonline.com\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
