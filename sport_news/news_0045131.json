It’s not his fault we didn’t hit. He managed a perfect playoff game.’’\nAnd got beat, 3-0, by the Astros in the AL wild-card game Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium because of a lack of hitting, a malady that hurt the Yankees in September.\nThough Girardi managed the Yankees to the 2009 World Series title, his clubs haven’t played a postseason series since 2012 when they beat the Orioles in the ALDS and got swept by the Tigers in the ALCS. Girardi, 51 next week, is 735-561 during eight regular seasons at the helm.\nAs for his coaching staff, changes are highly likely for the second consecutive year after hitting coach Kevin Long, who had a year left on a contract, and first base coach Mick Kelleher were let go following the 2014 season.\n“I will go through that with our ownership and Joe. Since you live through it for six months you have a pretty good feel about everything,’’ Cashman said when asked about the coaches’ status. “Now is the time to have these conversations. You live and you know it and you have a feel for what you might want to do with it as you move forward. Those conversations take place with your manager, take place with your coaches and take place with ownership.’’\nBench coach Rob Thomson, hitting coaches Jeff Pentland and Alan Cockrell as well as first-base coach Tony Pena have contracts that expire at the end of the month. Pitching coach Larry Rothschild has a year remaining.\nPentland, a 69-year-old baseball lifer, followed Long and worked his 17th season as a big league hitting coach. It might not be Girardi’s fault the Yankees failed to hit as expected, but remember Long was fired despite the fact Robinson Cano, the Yankees’ best hitter, was allowed to leave via free agency before the 2014 season.\nThe 52-year-old Cockrell, Pentland’s assistant, completed his first year with the Yankees.\nThomson, 52, was shifted from third base to bench coach following the 2014 season. This year was his eighth on the major league staff and 26th in the organization. The move from third to bench was curious because Thomson was widely regarded as a very good third-base coach. Joe Espada replaced Thomson at third.\nPena, 58, moved from the bench to first base this season. It was his 10th season with the Yankees. He was the first-base coach from 2006 to 2008 and on the bench from 2009 to 2014.\nShould the Yankees make moves with the coaches, Gary Tuck and Mike Harkey, longtime Girardi disciples, could be affected.\nTuck, the Yankees’ bullpen coach and catching instructor, has an option that is his. He was Girardi’s bench coach for the Marlins in 2006. Harkey, a Cubs teammate of Girardi’s, was the Yankees’ bullpen coach from 2008 to 2013. He served as the Diamondbacks’ pitching coach the past two seasons and was recently let go.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brian cashman ,  joe girardi ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:29:54.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
