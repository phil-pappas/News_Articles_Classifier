The toll is likely to increase if immediate steps are not taken for cleaning the pond. Requests by officials to keep the pind’s small had no effect on the people and they continued as before. Lakhs of devotees immersed the offerings on Somvati Amavasaya on October 12 causing shortage of oxygen leading leading to the death of fishes from the past 4-5 days. The pond stinks but the authorities have not taken any action so far. “The big sized pinds caused shortage of oxygen in the pond water leading to the death of the fishes. There is no other reason for it. We have informed senior officers in this connection,” said Yudhvir Singh Sangwan, District Fisheries Officer. Located 6 km away from the city on Gohana road, the site lacks arrangement to drain out dirty water from the pond. Spread over 36 acres, the complex has 40 inns for visitors. “We met public health department officers to install pumps here to drain out the dirty water into some vacant land nearby. But officials are busy passing the buck,” alleged Ram Bhagat Kaushik, member, Pandu Pindara Development Committee (PPDC). “We have provided a boat with other required material to the villagers for cleaning the pond and will provide other help also” said Mahinder Kumar Bishnoi, District Revenue Officer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:03:04.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
