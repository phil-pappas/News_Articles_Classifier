McCown, the first Browns passer with three straight 300-yard games, led Cleveland 51 yards down the field to set up the winning field goal in overtime.\nThe Bills were missing wide receiver Sammy Watkins and running backs LeSean McCoy and Karlos Williams because of injuries, and they lost another running back in the second quarter when Cierre Wood hurt his knee. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor looked like an offense on his own, however, throwing for a touchdown, running for a 22-yard score and even catching a 4-yard pass to set up a touchdown against the Titans. “Man, it was tough sledding, but he’s got guts; he’s got heart,” Coach Rex Ryan said of Taylor, who finished with 76 rushing yards.\nCarson Palmer threw only 14 passes against the Lions, but that was all the Cardinals needed as Palmer, who had 161 passing yards, finished with as many scoring throws (three) as incompletions.\nInjury Report\nChiefs running back Jamaal Charles hurt his right knee, and the preliminary diagnosis was a torn anterior cruciate ligament. ... Broncos linebacker DeMarcus Ware hurt his back. ... Ravens linebacker Elvis Dumervil hurt his groin. ... Rams defensive end Chris Long injured his knee against the Packers, who lost defensive tackle B. J. Raji (groin). ... Saints receiver Marques Colston hurt his arm. ...
