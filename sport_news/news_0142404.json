Win today and that would amp up considerably, though, as the Rebels have a chance to get into the West Division driver’s seat.\nUNLV (2-3, 1-0) and San Jose State (2-3, 1-1) kick off at 6:05 p.m. in Sam Boyd Stadium. The game will stream online at Campus Insiders and the Mountain West Network.\nThe Rebels go into the game with backup quarterback Kurt Palandech as the starter, according to coach Tony Sanchez. That means an offense that struggled to find consistency this season will keep searching for that and likely rely heavily on the running game today.\nOn paper the Spartans are probably the better team, but the gap isn’t too big and both teams enter the game today realistically believing they can win. San Jose State is minus-3 but Sanchez is 4-1 against the spread.\nOf course, the one game UNLV didn’t cover was a combination of the best team they’ve faced and quarterback Blake Decker going down in the first quarter. SJSU isn’t the same type of opponent but the Spartans hung around last week at Auburn and so far opponents have dominated UNLV’s offense with Palandech as the primary quarterback.\nIf things don’t go as well as Sanchez believes they will on offense, the difference in this year’s team compared to recent ones is that they can rely on the defense. Spartans running back Tyler Ervin will be a big challenge for the Rebels, but they’ve handled themselves well for the majority of the season. The concern on that side is if they don’t get much rest in between series or if UNLV hands SJSU good starting field position a few possessions in a row.\nThose things have continually worn down the defense and it doesn’t take much of that to make a close game into a blowout.\nBern’s prediction : If Decker or freshman Dalton Sneed don’t play in this game, I don’t see UNLV winning.
