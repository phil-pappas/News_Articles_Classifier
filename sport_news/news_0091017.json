(PRWEB) October 13, 2015\nThe Berenberg Gary Player Invitational concluded yet another successful event with some of the biggest names in golf, business and entertainment, which celebrated the Union of Golf and Giving with golf icon and Grand Slam champion Gary Player.

The day’s festivities raised $212,000 for The Player Foundation, which aids the betterment of impoverished communities and the expansion of educational opportunities around the world.\nThe team led by Chi Chi Rodriguez had a winning score of 16 under par and was crowned champion of the 2015 Berenberg Gary Player Invitational at GlenArbor Golf Club.\nThe all-star field featured the only golfer in history to have been awarded Player of the Year on all three PGA Tours, Tom Lehman; 2013 PGA Championship winner Jason Dufner; and ninety-time international tournament winner and LPGA legend with the most wins to her name, Annika Sorenstam.

With a powerful presence in North and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Black Knight is a multicultural and multilingual company offering branded services for the leisure and real estate industries. This rapidly growing firm is diverse and infused with the same tenaciousness and drive as Gary Player, world renowned iconic golfer. The holding company divisions include: Gary Player Design, Player Real Estate, Black Knight Enterprises, Black Knight Solutions, Black Knight Capital, Gary Player Academies, and The Player Foundation.\nABOUT THE PLAYER FOUNDATION\nThe Player Foundation was established in 1983 by Marc Player. What began as an effort to provide education, nutrition, medical care and athletic activities, for a small community of disadvantaged children living on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa has now blossomed into an organization that circles the globe bringing aid to underprivileged children and impoverished communities.\nThe Foundation is funded primarily by six Gary Player Invitational events presented through Black Knight International. Pairing celebrities and professional golfers from the PGA and Champions Tours with businessmen and international sports figures, the annual tournaments are staged in the United States, China, Europe and South Africa. The proceeds of these tournaments and other special events provide funding for an ever- expanding number of institutions around the world, including the Blair Atholl Schools in South Africa, the Pleasant City Elementary School in Palm Beach, the Masizame in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, and AIDS infected children in Baoshan, a drug-infested city located on the China-Burma border. Since its establishment, The Player Foundation has donated more than $60 million to the support of children’s charities, the betterment of impoverished communities and the expansion of educational opportunities throughout the world.\nGary Player, acknowledged as a world-class humanitarian, believes that the strength of our future depends upon the abilities of our children. “I have found that the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others does not thrust itself upon us,” Player says, “But we do not need to look hard for it either. When you spot the chance to give back to the world, act on it. You will have made life better, for others, and for yourself.”\nThe Gary Player Foundation is a non-profit 501 C (3) organization managed by Black Knight International in Palm Beach, Florida.\nABOUT BERENBERG\nBerenberg was established in 1590 and today we are one of Europe’s leading privately owned banks. With our headquarters in Hamburg and strong presences in Frankfurt, London, New York and Zurich we work from 19 offices across Europe, America and Asia.

Our Managing Partners lead Berenberg’s 1,250 professionals in their commitment to delivering a modern and efficient service, while maintaining a firm connection with our heritage and traditions.\n“We are proud to call Gary Player our Brand Ambassador, as he is truly a great Ambassador for the game of golf,” says Dr. Hans-Walter Peters, Managing Partner of Berenberg. “This must be measured not just in terms of his career achievements as a Grand Slam Champion, but also in driving such outstanding philanthropic initiatives as the Gary Player Invitational series. The event’s great virtues and its ability to give so much back to charity is one of the many reasons we have chosen this sponsorship as an important business platform for years to come.”\n###\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13019909.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13019909.htm"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:21:05.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
