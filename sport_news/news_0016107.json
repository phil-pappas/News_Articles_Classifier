Omar Kelly Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Dolphins' Dion Sims cleared to return after missing month with concussion \nIt has taken Dion Sims a month, but the Miami Dolphins tight end has finally received medical clearance to play in games. \nSims, who suffered a scary looking concussion in Miami's 17-10 season-opening win over Washington, has practiced on and off for the past two weeks. But Sims was light-headed and admitted to battling concussion symptoms after a few practices two weeks ago, which led to him being shut down. \nHowever, Sims claims he took and passed the NFL's mandated concussion test this week, and expects to play in Sunday's 1 p.m. game against the Tennessee Titans. \n\"I just had to be patient. It took time,\" said Sims, who has caught 30 passes for 316 yards and scored three touchdowns in his two previous seasons. \"I'm ready to go ... I'm about 100 percent.\" \nSims' presence on the field could drastically benefit the offense because he's viewed as a starter in Miami's two-tight end base offense, and Sims is Miami's best in-line blocker. His immediate goal is to help jump-start the Dolphins' rushing attack, which is averaging a dismal 69.3 rushing yards per game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:06:52.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
