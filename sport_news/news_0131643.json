Vettel, the four-time world champion, was 0.450 seconds quicker than his Ferrari team mate Kimi Raikkonen to top the standings. Red Bull drivers Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo also showed signs of recovery as they finished third and fourth respectively, Sport24 reported. Meanwhile, Mercedes drivers showed signs of fallibility as Hamilton was fifth ahead of his team mate Nico Rosberg. Earlier on Friday, Hamilton failed to replicate his dominant show as he struggled to clinch the top spot in both practice sessions. Hamilton heads into Sunday's showdown holding a 53-point lead over his nearest challenger Rosberg in the drivers' championship table.
