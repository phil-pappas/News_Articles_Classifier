Or maybe it was just a temporary respite for the beleaguered Longhorns and their coach.\nRegardless, the 24-17 win against the 10th-ranked Sooners (4-1, 1-1 Big 12) on Saturday was no ordinary victory for Texas.\n\"We heard all week how the pride has been lost, how we don't play hard,\" Strong said. \"And I don't have an answer for last week — we go out and we kind of just lay an egg — and this week we came out and we wanted to impose our will.

Naashon Hughes and Poona Ford buried Mayfield for a 17-yard loss on a third-and-14 deep in Oklahoma territory late in the fourth quarter on what turned out to be a fitting last offensive play of the game for the Sooners.\nWhen Jerrod Heard and the Longhorns offense got the ball with 3:33 left and Texas leading 24-17, they never gave it back.\n\"We needed this,\" Strong said.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:27:27.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
