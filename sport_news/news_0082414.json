That was among infractions against the men’s basketball and men’s golf programs. \n“The fact that NCAA violations happened on my watch is something that I regret and take very seriously. I am committed to winning with integrity and we must - and we will - do better,” the 75-year-old Brown said in a statement. “While the decision to not appeal our postseason ban was made in the best interests of the program, I am truly disappointed for our student-athletes who are the most impacted by the penalties and who had nothing to do with the infractions.” \nBut SMU does plan to appeal several sanctions, including scholarship losses in men’s basketball and men’s golf and recruiting restrictions in men’s basketball. SMU will also challenge the vacating of men’s basketball victories during the 2013-14 season due to a student deemed ineligible. \nSMU will also appeal the penalty applied to men’s golf that resulted in a postseason ban for the team and for individual competition. \nMustangs star Bryson DeChambeau, now a senior, last summer became only the fifth player ever to win the U.S. Amateur and NCAA individual titles in the same year. The current ban would keep him from having any opportunity to repeat as NCAA champion. \nBut the basketball team will not have a chance to return to the NCAA Tournament at the end of the 2015-16 season after making the field last year for the first time since 1993. The NCAA Tournament return last season came in Brown’s third at SMU. \nIn his letter, Turner said appeals of the postseason ban or Brown’s suspension would be a lengthy process and that uncertainty during such a period could harm many aspects of the program. \n“When faced with the difficult choices regarding appealing the Committee on Infractions findings and penalties, we made deliberative decisions in the best interests of our programs and our university,” said Rick Hart, the school’s athletic director. “Regrettably, student-athletes with no involvement will be penalized for the actions of others, but violations occurred and it is time to move forward. “ \nTurner said school officials heard from hundreds of SMU supporters, and also analyzed the NCAA findings and sanctions. There were also deliberations with internal and external counsel, university and athletic department leadership, and a special task force of school trustees. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:07:56.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
