I was proud we were able to win the league (by virtue of 76-69 win),” Ellis said. \n“I’d say the West Virginia game,” agreed senior Jamari Traylor. “That gave us 11 straight (league titles).” \nKU junior guard Frank Mason III was asked what would be the strength of this year’s team. \n“I would say depth,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of guys who can come off the bench and spark the team. Most importantly, our great coach.” \nAsked what the team’s free-throw shooting percentage would be in 2015-16, junior guard Wayne Selden Jr. said, “One hundred percent. I think it’ll be high 70s, mid 70s,” he added in a more serious tone. \nSelf chimed in: “With the new rules this year, officials will be calling games so tight, winning games at the free-throw line will probably be more important than ever.” \nFielding a question about what he thinks of KU’s new McCarthy Hall for the players, Traylor said: “It’s really cool. There’s a (basketball) court we go in to shoot whenever we want. We play ping-pong. Overall, there’s a lot more space.” \nThe Jayhawks headed straight from the practice gym to the fieldhouse to assist at Ladies Night Out. \n“It might be a little tough. We worked hard today,” Ellis said. “But when we get going, we’re good to go. It’s all for a good cause. We’re just having fun getting together, clowning and having a good time.” \nNoted junior forward Landen Lucas: “It’s awesome to see some of the same people come out year after year. It’s an amazing feat for them (those who have beaten cancer). For us to be around them and see how happy they are ... just to be here can show there’s a lot bigger things going on in people’s lives. Coach Self has a ton of different outside charity things we work on. We get to be around a lot of special things he’s doing. He definitely lets us get involved in everything.” \nSelf said the Jayhawks had a good practice before Ladies Night Out. \n“It wasn’t bad. It wasn’t the best, but I think we gained on it a little bit today,” he said, noting KU’s injured players (Selden, Traylor, ankle sprains) were back practicing. “We need to get better the next two days because beginning next week we’ll start scrimmaging an awful lot. There’s an awful lot of stuff we need to get in before we start scrimmaging.” \nFirst exhibition is Nov. 4 versus Pittsburg State. Tipoff is 7 p.m. in Allen. \nRecruiting visitor : Jarrett Allen, a 6-9 senior forward from St. Stephens Episcopal School in Austin, Texas, who is ranked No. 20 nationally in the Class of 2016 by Rivals.com, will begin his official visit to KU today. He is also considering Notre Dame, Houston, Indiana, Kansas State, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas. ...
