Manager Terry Collins' team never trailed for a single inning in taking all four games in the NL Championship Series. New York, seeking its first title since 1986, will play Game 1 of the World Series at either Kansas City or Toronto on Tuesday night. The Royals lead the AL Championship Series 3-2. Murphy broke the postseason mark set by Houston's Carlos Beltran in 2004 with a two-run drive in the eighth inning. Lucas Duda homered and drove in five runs. Travis d'Arnaud also connected as the Mets advanced to their first World Series since 2000. Kris Bryant homered for Chicago, but a championship drought dating to 1908 continues. Joe Maddon's young team had many believing this might be the year, but the Cubs did little against the Mets' fresh aces. — The Associated Press College basketball UNH women picked third in AE DURHAM — The University of New Hampshire women's basketball team was picked third in the 2015-16 America East preseason coaches' poll and senior guard Elizabeth Belanger was named to the preseason all-conference team.

Ridley is currently on the physically unable to perform list after tearing the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his right knee while with the Patriots last season. Coach Todd Bowles says Wednesday that there's \"a chance\" Ridley could play Sunday. Ridley was a full participant at practice, but Bowles wants to see how he feels as the week progresses. Cornerback Dee Milliner, on short-term injured reserve, also fully participated but must miss two more games before he can be activated.
