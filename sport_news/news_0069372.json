The Lynx will return determined to keep chasing championships with this core. Winter leagues overseas are where the players make the most money, but that's also where their bodies can get beat up without enough time to recover from the five-month WNBA season. Seimone Augustus, Lindsay Whalen and Rebekkah Brunson will begin to taper their international participation so they can stay fresh for the summers ahead. \n\"Money's not everything, not when you're talking about dynasties and legacies and inspiring young women and men and opening peoples' minds,\" Augustus said. \"Money can't buy the experience of those opportunities. I'm comfortable financially. I think a lot of the young ladies here are comfortable financially. We're not super rich like the guys, but we can't complain. So we'll definitely take our time with the decisions we make over the next few years.\" \nThis team, and the league, means a lot to them. \n\"We'll just kind of gauge how we feel because we really want to continue to be here for the Lynx and build not just the Lynx but the WNBA as well,\" Augustus said. \"As long as you've got a powerhouse team like the Lynx around and other teams, it'll continue to help this league grow.\" \nThese decisions won't apply to Maya Moore yet, of course. She averaged 23.4 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.6 assists in the 10 playoff games, at the age of 26. \n\"Maya's too young to discuss that,\" Augustus said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:25:27.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
