Signal photo by Katharine Lotze \nWhen sophomore forward Mari Kneisel was given her first tour of the College of the Canyons facilities, her head coach Justin Lundin introduced her to the lifting coach as “the next Stacey Atwater.” \nHe knew what Kneisel was capable of before she did. \n“I was just like ‘what did he just say?,’” Kneisel recalled. “I was so scared for it, but I knew I wanted to work up to that if he said I could be there, I could get there and I could even be better than what he thought. And I wanted to get there.” \nAtwater, a Saugus High graduate and current Cal Poly Pomona forward, was the 2013 Western State Conference, South Division Player of the Year and became the Cougars’ all-time leading goal scorer (36 career goals) and had the most points in COC’s history (79) when she left the school. \n“He did see a lot of potential in me,” Kneisel says. “And not that I didn’t think I was a good player, I just didn’t know I was Stacey Atwater good.” \nBut she has been “Stacey Atwater” good, and then some. \nThe Canyon High graduate worked her way up through the freshman, junior varsity, and varsity lineups to earn her way to All-Santa Clarita Valley first-team honors during her senior year and a Signal Female Athlete of the Year nomination in 2013-14. \nAnd since joining the COC women’s soccer team in 2014, she’s followed in Atwater’s footsteps and has even surpassed some of them. \nA 20-goal, 55-point, WSC South Player of the Year performance her freshman year combined with a furious start to her sophomore season has already moved her past Atwater’s and COC’s career record for most career points with 87. \nAnd with her 32 goals so far as a Cougar, she’s on the brink of breaking Atwater’s 2013 record for total career goals with 10 WSC South games still to be played this season. \nIn her second year at COC, Kneisel has already racked up 12 goals, eight assists, and 32 points in just 10 games played. \n“Last year I didn’t really think about breaking records,” says Kneisel. “I just went and played. I played for my team. I scored, I assisted. It was always a goal (that) I wasn’t going to make it about myself. But I always thought I kind of had this in my mind that I wanted to get (to the record), but I wasn’t going to get there just doing me. I was going to do it for my team as well.” \nThe team benefitted from Kneisel’s scoring and assisting in 2014 on the way to a fourth WSC South title in a row with a 12-1-1 conference record. \n“Mari is a true goal scorer,” Lundin says. “She has a knack for putting the ball in the goal, but she is unselfish. She’s just a high character kid. She has a strong work ethic that translates to the field.” \nWith the help of Kneisel’s offensive burst this season COC sits atop the WSC South tied with L.A. Valley — both squads currently have a 3-0-2 conference record. \nBut all of Kneisel’s goals haven’t come easy, despite having a quick shot, the ability to score from the left and right foot and from headers, and the capability to shoot from short or long range. \nWith the success comes the challenges of having to be defended even harder. But she’s OK with that. \n“You put two players on me, that’s a challenge. I’m going to score. I’m a very competitive person, even in games that don’t matter,” Kneisel says. “I’m very competitive. I hate tying. I don’t want to lose.” \nHer competitive mindset is always on. \nKneisel said her and her father John Kneisel, who was her coach her prior to club soccer days, go over her matches after she gets home. It’s a luxury she can benefit from by going to school close to home. \n“She’s been very unselfish and a focused player since she was 6 years old, always trying to improve as she goes along,” John says. “She never quits.” \nAnd Kneisel won’t quit. \nShe’s determined to play soccer after she finishes her career at COC, hopefully at UCLA. But before she can think about that, she has another record to check off her list. \n“Oh, I planned on (getting the career goal record),” Kneisel says. “I think my main goal was most career points and I did get that, so I moved on to most career goals. We’re not even halfway through conference, so I plan on getting that in the next few games.” \nWhen the next forward filled with potential gets a tour of the COC facilities, Lundin might have to introduce her as the next Mari Kneisel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:57:20.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
