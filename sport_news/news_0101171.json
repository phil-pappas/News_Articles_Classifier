Kobe, Lakers Open Preseason Vs. Jazz Kobe Bryant only played 12 minutes in the Los Angeles Lakers first game of the 2015-16 preseason Privacy Policy | More Newsletters Getty Images D'Angelo Russell #1 of the Los Angeles Lakers made his debut in the Lakers' preseason opener on October 4, 2015. In this file photo, Russell poses for a portrait during the 2015 NBA rookie photo shoot on August 8, 2015 at Madison Square Garden Training Facility in Tarrytown, New York. Kobe Bryant returned to the starting lineup as the Los Angeles Lakers opened their 2015-16 preseason in Honolulu, Hawaii with a 90-71 loss to the Utah Jazz. Early in preseason, the final score does not usually mean all that much, and the Lakers could take a great deal of positives that came out of the night. Above all, Bryant played all 12 minutes of the first quarter and did not get hurt. Entering his 20th season with the Lakers, Bryant shot 1-5 for five points in his 12 minutes at small forward with no turnovers. In the second half, even \"Ko-be\" chants from the crowd at the Stan Sheriff Center could not pull Bryant back into the game. Lakers coach Byron Scott and his training staff have opted to take a cautious approach to Bryant in training camp, and that approach appears to have carried into the preseason. \"I think it's great,\" Bryant said on TWC SportsNet when asked about the crowd chanting his name. LAKERS HAWAII_KNBC7FBI ${embedItem.body} (Published Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015) Alongside Bryant, the new-look Lakers started Jordan Clarkson, D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle and Roy Hibbert. Three of the five starter joined the Lakers via either the 2014 or 2015 NBA Drafts, hinting at how this could be the core of the team for the foreseeable future. Russell had his moments, including a peach of a pass, and finished with five points and three assists. Lakers \"Ahead of Schedule\" After First Practice For the starting unit, however, Clarkson stood out. Clarkson, who earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors for the 2014-15 season, finished with nine points and five rebounds in 21 minutes. The second year guard's defense, in particular, looked improved. Off the bench, new signing Lou Williams and veteran Nick Young both had good nights. Young, who replaced Bryant on the first unit in the second half, finished with 10 points in the preseason debut. In his Lakers debut, Williams led the team with 14 points and four assists in 27 minutes. If nothing else, Young and Williams proved that they can coexist on a basketball court and be productive. That is a good start. Next, the Lakers and Jazz will play at the same arena again on Tuesday. Notes : Metta World Peace did not play, as the forward has been suffering with a calf issue. Marcelo Huertas (hamstring) and Larry Nance Jr. (back) also sat out with injuries. Michael Frazier, Jonathan Holmes, and Robert Upshaw did not play.
