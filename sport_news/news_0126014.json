He did throw one interception but also connected with Steven Sims Jr. for the Jayhawks only score on the day.\nIn just the first 30 minutes, the undefeated Bears racked up 425 yards total, 298 of which came in the first quarter. Out of Baylor’s seven first-half scoring drives, none of them took more than two minutes and 16 seconds.\nThings got even worse in Lawrence when 410-pound tight end LaQuan McGowan stumbled into the end zone for an 18-yard score, to give the Bears a 38-7 advantage.\nKansas did show life to start the game as Willis’ touchdown drive came right after Baylor’s first score, but the momentum was short lived as Kansas showed they had no answer for the Baylor offense.\nThe Jayhawks will look to find more answers on both sides of the ball next week when they host a slightly easier opponent, the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Kick-off is set for 11 a.m. central time in Lawrence.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and FootballKC.
