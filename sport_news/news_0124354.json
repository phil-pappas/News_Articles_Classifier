The maximum home price such a worker could afford is $142,000. The median home value in the Portland area is currently $295,600.\nThe most affordable place for a construction worker is Buffalo, New York, where the median construction worker making $35,000 annually can afford 63.2 percent of listings, Zillow found.\nThe outlook in Portland isn't great for teachers, either. A typical teacher making $40,000 can only afford 28.5 percent of listings, the report shows. That's the fourth-least affordable market in the nation, behind Virginia Beach and the Utah cities of Provo and Salt Lake City.\nThe most affordable place for a teacher is Bakersfield, California, where a teacher's median income of $61,000 makes him or her eligible for 86.4 percent of listings. Buffalo came in third place for teachers.\nThe report comes amid year-over-year increases in home values (9.1 percent) and rent (10.8 percent) in Portland, according to Zillow.\n-- Luke Hammill\nlhammill@oregonian.com\n503-294-4029\n@lucashammill", "external_links": ["http://www.zillow.com/portland-metro-or_r394998/home-values/", "http://www.twitter.com/lucashammill"], "published": "2015-10-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:23:12.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
