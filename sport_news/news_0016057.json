CLICK HERE FOR ALL OF THE DISTRICT FOOTBALL BRACKETS Class 6 Only 32 teams compete for the Class 6 state championship, but because of the top end talent it might be one of the most difficult state championships to win. Kansas City has dominated the class, with Rockhurst, Blue Springs and Blue Springs South winning seven of the last 13 state championships. CBC ended that streak last year and might be the best team in Missouri not named Webb City, although MaxPreps puts the Cadets at No. 24 in the nation and Webb City at No. 64. The Kansas City area is clearly down this year while Kickapoo and Joplin are playing great football. It’ll be interesting to see how it pans out. District 4 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Why Kickapoo wins – The Chiefs have played great football all year and really haven’t been challenged by anyone. Not to say that they didn’t play good teams, but that’s just how good Kickapoo is. There’s not a facet of the game that the Chiefs haven’t been outstanding and while the saying goes ‘defense wins championships’ rules changes make it easier to score than ever before. And on top of that, Kickapoo has the weapons to score. Malachi Stout has rushed for 1,063 yards and 26 touchdowns, along with four receiving touchdowns and a pair of return touchdowns. He has to continue to be a playmaker moving forward. Kickapoo is a wildcard. We don’t know exactly where their ceiling is or if they have one. It is easy to assume that they can’t compete with the big guns of Class 6, but honestly we don’t know. Kickapoo plays at a pace that is impossible to prepare for and do it with balance. Chris Lawson doesn’t turn the football over (15 TDs – 1 INT) and an opportunistic defense led by Mason Pack loves creating turnovers (21 in 2015). It will be a tall order for a high school team to sit on a bus for three hours and be physically and mentally ready to play this team. Why Joplin wins – Joplin will have an absolute war each Friday to win a district championship. Their trek could go Blue Springs (2013 state champ), Rockhurst (2010 state champ) and Kickapoo or Lee’s Summit West. But, this Eagles team has grown since that loss to Kickapoo and the story goes, as Colby Cornett goes, so goes Joplin. In wins he has been outstanding; completing 70% of his passes with a 14-2 touchdown to interception ratio. When Cornett is playing well that offense is a juggernaut, which is what it will need to be in this district. Curtis Jasper has done a tremendous job with this team, especially schematically on offense. He will need to continue to be creative for Joplin to make a run. Class 5 Since the summer we’ve pegged this as the sleeper class; it is the most likely for the Ozarks to win a state championship outside of Webb City and Lamar. Class 5 is the catch-all class so it’s size fluctuates yearly and there is more parity here than in any other class. Nixa made a run to the Dome last year, Ozark made a semifinal run two years before that. With the way the bracket shakes out, the winners of District 4 and District 5 will play each other for a semifinal berth, making one local team just a win away from St. Louis. District 6 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Favorite: Carthage – The Tigers have been elite all year and are riding an eight-game win streak since losing the season opener to Webb City. Alex Derryberry is back and healthy, which is as big of a boost to the defense as it is to the offense. They’ve already beaten Willard and Neosho, which could be good or bad depending on how you feel about rematches. After last year’s 24-21 loss to Nixa in the quarterfinals, this kind of feels like a team of destiny. Darkhorse No. 1: Neosho – It is impossible not to put Neosho here. The Wildcats have had an unreal run, but the crazy part is they are just two possessions away from being 8-1, when you look at the late collapse in a 41-38 loss to Willard and a 20-19 loss to Carthage. When they establish the run with Devin Hames they have you at their mercy. If the defense can get off the field on third down and limit big plays this could be a dangerous team. Darkhorse No. 2: Willard – I feel confident in saying that Willard will play for the district championship at the No. 5 seed. It will take trips to Belton and to Smith-Cotton to do so, but had they played the schedule Willard did the seeds would look a little different. The big thing for Willard is health, especially defensively. They’ve given up a ton of points due to injuries on the defensive side of the ball. If they can get healthy and feed people a steady dose of Hunter Yeargan, the Tigers will make it to the district championship and set up a COC-Large rematch. Name You Know: Devin Hames, Neosho – This kid has been stacking up 200 yard games like crazy. He forces you to load the box which makes defenses susceptible to play action and big plays. A Neosho district title run needs monster performances from Hames. Name You Should Know: Dausen Gourley, Carthage – We all love speed and Gourley has plenty of it. He helps stretch defenses and give everyone else more room to work. He can run it and catch it, but he also locks down one side of the field defensively. District 5 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Favorite: Republic – The Tigers have come on strong to end the season, grabbing the No. 1 seed with road wins over rivals Willard and Nixa. Jerney Jones has done Jerney Jones things all year, but the play of sophomore quarterback Riley Watkins has helped this offense score 40 or more five times this year, all of which are wins. Everyone knows what they are going to do offensively, the question is can you stop it? Close Second: Nixa – It’s hard to not go with the Eagles. We know all about the run last year, but this year they’ve had some consistency problems. Nixa has lost four of five to end the season and righting the ship depends on the health of Logan Tyler and the Nixa defense. Early in the year that unit was elite, but lately it’s been gashed by various running backs. If they return to form they should win the district. Darkhorse No. 2: Glendale – Here Jordan goes again with the “Glendale could pull some upsets” talk. But, back-to-back wins over Waynesville and Camdenton to end the season certainly support that. This offense has been even better than last year and the defense is showing signs of being able to hold opponents under 50, which will typically be enough for them to win with that offense. Again, you can’t duplicate what they do in practice, so until you’ve seen it preparing your kids for it is nearly impossible. The scary part is this Alex Huston (4,638 yards, 56 touchdowns) to Luke Montgomery (110 catches, 1,747 yards, 23 touchdowns), Von Oeser (94-894-11) and Jeremy Almeida (73-795-9) has another year to do some damage. Name You Know: Anthony Riley, Parkview – The kid has rushed for 1,699 yards and 22 touchdowns, setting the tone for Anthony Hays smash-mouth system. Parkview is 3-1 when Riley rushes for at least 175 yards, but 1-4 when he is below it. Parkview has also gotten a boost from Chaviz Nguyen (626 yards, 6 TDs). Name You Should Know: Quinton Batson, Central – There are several underclassmen in the Ozarks that will receive D-1 interest, but Batson is right there with Lawson in terms of being the most talented in the Ozarks. He’s a big, athletic kid with a live arm; there’s not a throw he can’t make. He’s only a sophomore, but he’s good enough to help Central make a run. District 4 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Favorite: Battle – They are the defending Class 5 state champs and knocking them off seems unlikely, especially with D-1 prospects Jerrion Nelson, Jaevon McQuitty and Darion Hall back in the mix. But, losing games to Jeff City and Hannibal to end the season, as well as a one-point loss to Helias suggest that maybe there is a chink in the armor. Darkhorse: Waynesville – The Tigers have been inconsistent, but when they play well they are tough. Moving Seth Hedrick to receiver has been a season-changing move and opened up the offense. There is no shortage of talent with D-1 prospects Sam Roberts in the trenches and Cedric Williams at tight end. But, the Tigers are -12 in the turnover battle. If they clean that up they can be dangerous. Name You Should Know: Jay Griffin, Camdenton – By the time all is said and done, No. 27 will go down as one of the best Lakers ever. He’s just a sophomore but has taken over the role of feature back for Jeff Shore. When Camdenton plays Laker Football and can grind the clock they are good, but when they have to play from behind they get themselves into trouble. Griffin can help change all of that.

Class 4 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Webb City. Webb City. Webb City. That’s all you know to know in Class 4. I won’t bore you too much, and there are some other good teams in Class 4 and major athletes when you look at Kearney linebacker Cale Garrett (Navy commit) and Cape Central athlete Al Young, but ultimate Webb City will win another state championship. But, you can make a case for the team most likely to upset them also being in the same district. Favorite: Webb City – Even when it seems like they are down, they aren’t really down. The Cardinals have won 37-straight and while the passing game isn’t what it was last year and the defense has given up some big plays, Webb City is still Webb City. Mizzou commit Trystan Castillo is a human plow on the offensive line, Kolesen Crane is the best defensive player in the Ozarks (had a D-2 coach tell me he’s start for them right now) and Tyson Roderique makes this team whole. He’s finally getting back to health, which is bad news for the rest of the state. Close Second: West Plains – This is the most disrespected team in Class 4; they’ve lost one game to undefeated Kickapoo and still can’t get any love in the state polls. Not to that the poll is a joke, but if the shoe fits… Regardless, West Plains is one of the best in Class 4. Steve Ary has battle injuries and still gotten his team to perform. Keegan Hoopes and Ryan Martin run it, Sam Hall throws it and they play salty defense. But, they play football with a chip on their shoulder that helps when you play programs like Webb City and Bolivar. Name(s) You Know: Bolivar Offense – It’s impossible to pick just one, but if the Libs are to make a district championship run then it will come from them outscoring people. This is probably the best cast that Lance Roweton has ever had with Aaron Samek, Johnny Scott, Case Jones, Bryce Krueger and Brandon Emmert, with junior Connor Sechler being the triggerman. This group has been successful in every single sport they play and last year’s Final Four run in basketball gave them yet more big-stage experience. This is Bolivar’s best chance to make a run; it will be interesting to see what they do with it. Name You Should Know: Dominic Burnett, Carl Junction – The Bulldogs had a few problems against Lamar on Friday night, but Burnett wasn’t one. He rushed for 150 yards and three touchdowns on 22 carries, giving the Tigers fits. Burnett has rushed for 1,367 yards and 20 touchdowns with eight 100-yard games and averaging 12 yards per carry. With the passing game being inconsistent, he will need to be a monster if Carl wants to hang with Webb City. Class 3 This is another class that is wide open. The Big 8 has made three consecutive semifinal runs with Monett losing to John Burroughs in 2012 and 2014, while Seneca handled the Bombers in 2013. All signs point to another local team meeting up with JB in the Final Four, but the question is who. Reeds Spring and Mountain Grove have been state-ranked all year, while Monett has proved that there has been no decline with the loss of a talented senior class and Chad Depee. District 3 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Favorite: Mountain Grove – The Panthers are the overwhelming favorite here. Trystan Short (1,076 yards, 12 TDs) and Carter Otwell (870 yards, nine touchdowns) were the best one-two rushing attack in the SCA. Mountain Grove was stout against Class 3 competition all year and have the most speed in the district. The big question is how they handle seeing Salem and Ava for a second time, with both teams being healthier. Darkhorse: Salem – The Tigers again find themselves in a position to be a headache for the district. Salem is big and physical and plays its brand of football well. But, the story is the same as last year; can they finish. Going 4-5 doesn’t look impressive, but when you consider their losses came to state-ranked Reeds Spring in overtime, state-ranked Mountain Grove in overtime, state-ranked Thayer in one of the ‘Cats toughest games of the season and Ava was also ranked at the time of its 26-21 win. The Tigers are so close to figuring it out, if it clicks soon they could be district champs. Name You Should Know: Paul Porter, Ava – Porter is the guy you always have to identify if you’re trying to stop Ava. He’s a dynamic playmaker that can lineup anywhere and his speed and quickness make him a factor on both sides of the ball. He gives Ava’s offense some diversity and he will need to break off some big plays for the Bears to make a run. District 4 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Favorite: Reeds Spring – I haven’t been high on the Wolves, but Reeds has done nothing except beat nearly everyone that lines up in front of them. I’ll give them a pass on the loss to Bolivar and the fact they were able to generate some turnovers bodes well for them moving forward. This team has to be hungry after coming up short in districts the last two seasons as the No. 1 seed. Homefield advantage and a group that is no stranger to big games could be enough to get over the hump. Close Second: Monett – I personally think Monett is the best team in the district. The Cubs are again good defensively, but this group is underrated on the offensive side of the ball with Cameron Witt and Michael Branch. Monett gave up 99 points all season and 64 of that came against Lamar and Carl Junction. This team is for real. Darkhorse: Aurora – I love what the Dawgs have been able to do recently. Aurora has won four of six with one loss coming to Lamar and another coming in a controversial finish against Monett. The offense is balanced and the defense flies around and makes plays. Their future will be decided on their ability to finish games, something they didn’t do against Cassville or Monett and two teams they could end up seeing again. Name You Know: Mason Husmann, Aurora – Not many people can do what this kid does at the high school level. The D-1 prospect is second to only Tanner Schnelle for the team lead in tackles, but has also added 19 tackles for loss, including eight sacks. As a defensive end he’s also broken up six passes and had an interception against Monett. He’s just not normal. Name You Should Know: Jarrett Massie, Mount Vernon – The ‘Neers won three of four to end the regular season with the lone loss coming in overtime to Class 5 Central. Massie and quarterback Garrett Hadlock help bring balance to Mount Vernon. Massie has 735 receiving yards and nine touchdowns on 39 catches. VIDEO: In the Zone - District Football Preview Class 2 District 3 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Favorite: MV-BT/Liberty – The Eagles are again undefeated SCA champs and really went unchallenged, although some of the scores make the games appear closer than they actually were. Liberty has been salty in every phase of the game and I’m not sure there’s anyone in the district up to the task of knocking them off. Darin Acklin’s team has won 17 straight at home, with their last loss at the Eagles’ Nest coming to Lamar in 2012 and that’s where they’ll play every district game. And, for as much attention as the offense gets, Liberty’s defense has been off the charts, allowing just 100 points all season. Senior Cale Cornman (104 tackles and 17 TFL) has again been a man amongst boys. Darkhorse: Fair Grove – The Eagles have enjoyed a rebirth this year going 6-3 including a two-point loss to Marionville. Fair Grove is another team that has used balance to its advantage this year and the maturation of quarterback Brayden Lumley has helped the offense average 33 PPG after scoring just 19 PPG in 2014. A big line and talent at the skill positions is never fun for a defense. Name You Know: Jacob Eden, Strafford – The senior back did exactly what we thought he would do, rushing for 1,151 yards and 18 touchdowns. He also led Strafford in receptions (26) and reception yards (270). Along with classmates Sam Morton (195 tackles) and quarterback Chanler Collins, this senior class isn’t used to losing and have mad rapid progress since the middle of the season. Can it be enough to make a district run? Name You Should Know: Triston Shepherd, Diamond – He’s pretty unknown in the Springfield area, but he’s the reason Diamond was the No. 2 seed until a Week 9 loss to Tolton Catholic. Shepherd has 1,005 yards of total offense and 13 touchdowns in just seven games. Defensively he has 41 tackles, 10 TFL and an interception despite being a part-time starter. Diamond hung with Tolton Catholic, making it to the district championship would be a huge step for this program. Lamar. Class 1 Class 1 is a mess. Outside of Valle Catholic, you can make a strong case for the five best teams being in the Ozarks and sharing three districts. Valle Catholic is still the king until someone knocks them off, but much like last year they will have to play the best the Ozarks has to offer for that to happen. District 2 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET The winner of Class 1 – District 2 will play Valle in the quarterfinals and that district will come down to Thayer, Lockwood and Marionville. Between the three you can make a case for all of them being the favorite or the most likely to be upset. The edge definitely goes to Thayer; it will be tough to make that bus ride and then knock them off. The fact that they own wins over Ava, Mountain Grove and Salem, one of which will be a Class 3 district champion, is impressive, so too is the fact they held Liberty to less than 20 points. We’ve talked about everyone else all year long, but Thayer might actually be the best option to beat Valle. Other than Penney, the last Class 1 team to be Valle was Thayer back in the 2008 quarterfinals... Marionville and Lockwood are in a very similar position right now as health could dictate just how far they go. Marionville has played stretches without Tanner Wright and Lockwood has played without Kyle Bouldin. While both backs played in Week 9, how healthy they’ll be moving for ward is the big question. If both are at full speed this potential semifinal is a tossup. I would anticipate a lot of points… Class 1 – District 3 is pretty straight forward; I don’t see anyone beating Jasper. Should the Eagles win, that would step up an All-Ozarks quarterfinal, making one local team a game away from St. Louis. District 4 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET And, in Class 1 – District 4, undefeated Skyline and Lincoln would battle it out. Skyline has been and will continue to be a monster. The Tigers are the favorite on that side and probably the most likely bet to end Valle’s reign. But, should they fall, it’ll be to Lincoln. The Cardinals have pitched five shutouts already and beat Osceola 50-15. Skyline and Osceola do have one common opponent in Cole Camp; Skyline beat them 48-6 and Lincoln beat them 32-6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:14:22.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
