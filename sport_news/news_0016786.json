He converted two first-half penalty kicks and added two other goals in the second half before setting up Luis Suarez's score in a 5-2 win over Rayo Vallecano. \nEarlier Saturday, Ronaldo set up a goal and scored another in a three-minute span to lead Real Madrid to a 3-0 win over Levante. \nThe results left the Spanish powerhouses provisionally atop the league standings with 18 points from eight matches, with Madrid ahead on goal difference. Villarreal is two points behind but can regain the lead when it hosts fourth-place Celta on Sunday. \n\"I'm very happy because of the victory and because of the way we played,\" the 23-year-old Neymar said. \"It's never easy to play against a quality team like Rayo. We did our job and it was a great victory.\" \nEngland \nChelsea and Manchester United bounced back from disappointing losses with impressive wins in the Premier League on Saturday. \nDiego Costa, returning from a three-match suspension for violent conduct, put the defending champions ahead against Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge, before defender Alan Hutton scored an own goal in Chelsea's 2-0 win. \nThe victory helped ease pressure on Jose Mourinho after his side's faltering start to the season, including a 3-1 loss at home to Southampton in the last round. \nUnited won 3-0 against Everton at Goodison Park, with Morgan Schneiderlin, Ander Herrera and Wayne Rooney scoring in an emphatic response to the 3-0 defeat against Arsenal two weeks ago. \nManchester City stayed in first place after Raheem Sterling scored a hat trick in a 5-1 win over Bournemouth, while Arsenal is two points back in second after a 3-0 win at Watford. \nNew Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp had to settle for a 0-0 draw at Tottenham in his first game in charge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:39:47.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
