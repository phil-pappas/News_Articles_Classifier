Oh, you mean, his off-the-court comments? Well, at least that’s what this question must mean given the 25-30 emails I received expressing frustration with Rose’s free agency comments from media day.\nOne thing that’s become very apparent from the fan feedback I receive is that anyone who has turned on Rose no longer can separate their anger or frustration between his injuries and his comments. It seemed to me people were angry Rose suffered a facial fracture the day after he made his comments about 2017 free agency. The latter is fair game. The former, I’ve never understood.\nEach time Rose has gotten injured, he has done so while fulfilling his contract and playing basketball. It’s not like Rose wants to be hurt. Obviously, Rose can think about the influx of TV money spiking free agency contracts, as I guarantee you many NBA players are. Just as obviously, you probably shouldn’t give voice to those thoughts, particularly in unsolicited fashion on the first day of a training camp he’s entering healthy for the first time in years. But it’s not like John Wall hasn’t commented on Reggie Jackson’s deal or LeBron James signs one-year deals with an option to maximize his worth. When all is said and done, Rose needs to play well this season. When he shifts the focus back to basketball, as he did during last season’s playoffs, everyone is better off.\nWho will start for Mike Dunleavy? -- Mike, Algonquin\nFred Hoiberg has stated he will use training camp and preseason games to determine his starters. The usual suspects are in the mix — Doug McDermott, Tony Snell, Nikola Mirotic. One thing Hoiberg keeps mentioning is this roster’s flexibility. I do think the Nikola Mirotic at small forward experiment should be out. I can see Hoiberg starting Snell to ease some defensive pressure on Butler initially but play McDermott more minutes off the bench.\nBulls' Doug McDermott: 'I just feel a lot more comfortable out there' Bulls' Doug McDermott: 'I just feel a lot more comfortable out there' (K.C.

Johnson, Chicago Tribune)\nSee more videos This is for certain: McDermott is being given every opportunity to succeed after a disappointing rookie season. And I had heard talk of starting Mirotic — presumably, at power forward over Noah — even before Dunleavy’s back surgery. So I think the starting lineup is very much open for business even when Dunleavy returns. My guess when he does return is Rose, Butler, Dunleavy, Mirotic or Noah and Gasol.\nWhat is realistic to expect out of Fred Hoiberg’s offense? -- Edgar, Chicago\nTwo things players have consistently talked about are “more freedom” and “more reads.” Like most teams, the Bulls will try to get something in transition first. If that fails, look for less play calls and more instinctive reads from players off basic sets. Hoiberg talks about inverting the floor a lot. He doesn’t think bigs belong solely on the block. He also has talked about using smaller lineups heavily predicated on shooting. And if his Iowa State background is any indication, he likes playing “four out and one in,” which, again, gives players plenty of freedom to make decisions. The dribble handoff into pick-and-roll actions also has been featured prominently as opposed to isolation plays.\nWill the Bulls carry 15 players? If so, who gets the 15 th roster spot? -- Marty, Palatine\nTraditionally, the Bulls have carried 14 players. And they will be a luxury tax team this season, but that’s not assessed until season’s end. So I could see them starting the season with 15 players. If they do, I would think Cristiano Felicio would grab the spot over Jordan Crawford. That’s a lot of bigs but the Bulls have genuine interest in the Brazilian big man. And don’t forget: Noah and possibly Gasol can be unrestricted free agents next summer.\nThanks for your questions,\nK.C.\nPrivacy Policy Derrick Rose Chicago Bulls Free Agency Nikola Mirotic Doug McDermott Tony Snell Reggie Jackson (basketball)", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56229cea/turbine/ct-bulls-doug-mcdermott-20151017", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5623a94c/turbine/ct-ask-kc-bulls-mailbag-20151017"], "published": "2015-10-18T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:03:59.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
