Mix Diskerud's shot from distance deflected off a crowd in front of goal and Watson-Siriboe one-touched the loose ball into the back of the net. \nLarin tied it in the 62nd minute after heading in Corey Ashe's cross. Eight minutes later, Larin made it 2-1 on a counter-attack. Larin fed Adrian Winter on a two-on-one, but Winter's shot was blocked by Josh Saunders. Winter was first to the loose ball and found an open Larin in front of goal for an easy tap in. \nLarin was inches away from a third goal in the 74th, but defenseman Jefferson Mena stopped it at a goal line. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:10:40.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
