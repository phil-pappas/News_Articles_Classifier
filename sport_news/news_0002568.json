Filipino ring icon had his shoulder checked by doctors at the Cardinal Medical Center in San Juan and also underwent an MRI on his torn rotator cuff. \nOn the other hand, Pacquiao (57-6-2-KO38) dropped Algieri six times to win a lopsided unanimous decision. \nSky Sports in Britain reported that Khan is hoping to lure Mayweather, who announced his retirement after an easy win over Andre Berto last Sept. 12 to come out of retirement and give him the fight he has long wanted provided he beats Pacquiao. \nThe 28-year-old Khan told Sky Sports: “I think Floyd Mayweather will have one more fight. He’s on 49-0 and he knows that. He’s got one more fight left in him. At the moment, he’s matching Rocky Marciano’s record, but he can beat him and get to 50. I’m there ready and waiting for him.” \nKhan added: “I think he thinks I’m too dangerous for him. I don’t think he’ll ever want to fight me. I bring too much to the table and would cause him a lot of problems. It’s all a waiting game. I’ll speak to Al Haymon and see what he says. I’ll see what he thinks is the best option but I need to fight the biggest names in boxing and the best fighters in the world.” \nKhan, who won a silver medal in the last Athens Olympic Games, said: “I want to fight Manny Pacquiao next because if I beat him, maybe that will make Floyd Mayweather come out of retirement to fight me. The public demand would be huge.” \nPacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum said he’s negotiating with Khan’s uncle and his lawyer, Robert Davis. \n“The negotiations are ongoing,” Arum told Telegraph Sport. “We were planning for Manny Pacquiao to fight at the end of February or, at the latest, the first two weeks in April.” \nKhan is currently the only potential opponent for Pacquiao, who Arum is considering because “I don’t negotiate with two people at the same time. I think that’s unethical.” \n“I believe that everybody is negotiating in good faith. While those negotiations are ­going on, I’m not going to discuss any other opponent for Manny Pacquiao. There is a possibility that it could happen in Dubai, but I think it’s more likely it will happen in Las Vegas,” Arum said. \nMeantime, Pacquiao’s torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder which was aggravated in the Mayweather showdown, had healed, according to doctors. \nThe next step would be to send the MRI to Dr. Neal ElAttrache, who did the surgery on Pacquiao’s right shoulder for evaluation and get his go-signal to fight again.
