Andrews, then working for ESPN, was in town to cover a Vanderbilt University football game. \nBarrett, who filmed Andrews through a front door peephole, subsequently uploaded several explicit clips to a video web site, which prompted an FBI probe that resulted in his arrest. Barrett, who is also a defendant in the Andrews lawsuit, was sentenced to 30 months in prison following his December 2009 guilty plea to felony stalking. \nThe trial is set to begin in February, more than four years after Andrews originally filed her lawsuit. She alleges that employees of the hotel were negligent by revealing her room information to Barrett, who also is named in the lawsuit.
