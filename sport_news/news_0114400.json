Posted: Sunday, October 25, 2015 5:00 am Big man leading big changes: Tackle Okafor key to Farmers’ resurgence Justin Thomas, jthomas@starlocalmedia.com Star Local Media | 0 comments \nWhen Lewisville head football coach Gregg Miller arrived in 2012, Denzel Okafor was a freshman. \nDuring his tenure, the 6-foot-4 standout tackle has seen the program take positive steps each year, going from one win, to three, to four in 2014, including three victories in a talented District 6-6A. \nWith three games remaining in 2015, Lewisville has already matched that total, and the senior Okafor can practically taste a playoff berth — which hasn’t happened for the Farmers since 2008. \nLewisville entered Friday’s contest against Plano East at 3-2 in 6-6A — tied for third with the Panthers and McKinney Boyd — and in control of its own destiny for a postseason position with contests against Plano Senior and Boyd still looming. \n“[The season] has been going great,” Okafor said. “We’ve really progressed from last year. We’re beating teams people thought we shouldn’t have beaten last year or that we couldn’t beat this year. Last year, we got blown out by (Plano) West and now we come back and beat them and people are kind of starting to say, ‘Hey, maybe the Farmers can make the playoffs.’ That’s what we’re working for. We mention it every day in practice. We haven’t been in so long, we really want to get it going and bring that mentality back.” \nA three-star recruit by Scout.com and preseason all-state performer by Dave Campbell’s Texas High School Football, Okafor is a key reason for the Farmers' resurgence. \nOn the field, the senior is a road-grader, helping a Lewisville offense that has struck a balance of run and pass. But it’s what Okafor has brought off the field that may have made the biggest impact. \nDuring the offseason, Miller praised Okafor for his leadership abilities, a role Okafor embraced, in particular after being voted a captain by his teammates. \n“It’s an amazing honor,” Okafor said. “My teammates and peers voted for me to lead them and that’s an honor and blessing. I’m have this title of captain and want to show that this is my team and that we have what it takes to get to the playoffs. I encourage them and show them what to work at. It’s amazing and I’m glad the one to do it.” \nThe role didn’t always come naturally to Okafor, however, in fact, the tackle shied away from the opportunity last year. \n“I wanted to run for captain last season, but I was a junior and didn’t want to take away that opportunity from a senior,” he said. “So I kind of stayed behind in the shadows. But this year, coach told me everyone looks up to me and that I need to step up and take that responsibility and I love it.” \nSo much so that Okafor is hoping to lead sophomore center Eric Jones on the same path. \n“He saw what I was doing as a junior and my role now as a senior,” Okafor said. “I’m tying to hand that off to him. He’s the center, so he kind of almost has to in a way, but I’m looking forward to seeing him embrace and see what he does next year.” \nIt’s that mentality that Miller says has permeated the program and the results can be seen not only on the scoreboard at the varsity level, but with the junior varsity and freshmen programs. \n“The younger kids definitely look up to us,” Okafor said. “They see that we’re having a good season and they think, ‘We can do that next year, too,’ and I agree. We want to win, but we also want to be a role model and bring back that tradition. It all starts with a mindset of believing and I think we’re establishing that. It’s a great feeling.” \nThe big-time recruit is not only helping change the culture at Lewisville, but has opened doors for some of his teammates during his recruiting. \nOkafor, meanwhile, has received offers from a plethora of Division I programs, including TCU, Texas, Texas A&M, Oklahoma and LSU, but hasn’t made a decision and doesn’t plan on doing so any time soon — certainly not while the Farmers are gunning for a playoff berth. \n“[Recruiting] has been going good, but it’s hectic,” he said. “Every week it’s, ‘Oh, UT lost to TCU. Are you going to TCU now?’ It’s fun, but also stressful, and it’s a lot more than who is having a good season. Does the school offer what you want to study? Is it where you want to be? Is it a type of offense that suits you well? Stuff like that. \n“It takes time. I told myself I was going to commit late August or early September, but all that’s gone by already. I really want to commit, but I don’t want to do it until I’m 100 percent positive that’s the place for me. There’s no rush. I have until spring and I’m just thankful God has blessed me with these offers to play at the next level.” \nThat time will come following the season, and Okafor and the Farmers are hoping for the longest season the Farmers have seen the past decade. \n“It’s going to be an all out fight for who wants it more,” Okafor said. “I can assure you that’s going to be us. We have to make it. Everyone is focused. We know what we need to do and what it’s going to take to get there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:14:42.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
