Coach Kurt Stein feels his senior-laden team is mature. So, that should help in the recovery. The bigger issue at hand is Oakdale faces another very good team this week in Walkersville. The Lions have been impressive all season, suffering their only loss by one point at unbeaten Linganore. Last week, they received almost 200 rushing yards and two touchdowns from junior Chad Gleason, who sat out the Linganore game while dealing with an assortment of injuries. Walkersville can deal Oakdale a potentially fatal blow to its playoff hopes with a victory. \nTuscarora (4-2) at Urbana (2-4): The Titans threw away a 14-point lead on their home field last week in a loss to South Hagerstown, thus damaging their chances to make the Class 3A West playoffs for the second time. This week, they begin a three-game road swing, looking for their third win over Urbana and first since 2009. The Hawks, on the other hand, are coming off a weather-delayed 9-7 road loss to Clarksburg last week. \nCatoctin (3-3) at Middletown (3-3): This is the first meeting between these teams since the season opener in 2012, which was won handily by Middletown on the way to its second consecutive state title. These teams used to meet just about every season. Catoctin’s last victory in the series occurred during its state championship season in 2009. The Knights have won the last three meetings since. Last week, Middletown won its second consecutive game with a 40-6 victory at Brunswick. Catoctin, meanwhile, was shut out at home by Walkersville, 27-0. \nWootton (2-4) at Linganore (6-0): The Lancers have survived the most difficult portion of their schedule with back-to-back wins over Walkersville and Oakdale. The latter will go down as one of the finest in school history, as Linganore erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter for a 21-20 victory over the talented but mistake-prone Bears. Now, the Lancers must guard against any lapses against the rest of their schedule. They will be heavily favored to win their final four games and finish their second consecutive regular season with an unbeaten record. The stretch run starts this week against Wootton, which snapped a four-game losing streak last week with a 28-18 home win over Rockville. \nThomas Johnson (3-3) at Westminster (2-4) : After back-to-back losses, the Patriots got back in the win column last week with a 27-0 home win over Baltimore’s Digital Harbor. Junior Nicolas Bishop led the winning effort with 183 rushing yards and a pair of touchdowns. TJ outgained Digital Harbor on the ground 201-18. This week, the Patriots will look to climb back over .500 against Westminster, which is looking to snap a two-game losing streak of its own. \nFrederick (1-5) at Williamsport (2-4): This is the first meeting between these teams. It likely popped onto the schedule because former Frederick coach Vince Ahearn spent the previous two years coaching at Williamsport. The Cadets are trying to snap a three-game losing streak. The Wildcats, on the other hand, broke a four-game slide last week with a 22-7 home win over North Hagerstown. \nSmithsburg (4-2) at Brunswick (0-6): The Railroaders will be looking for their first win against a Smithsburg team they have beaten five consecutive times. \nMSD (6-1) at Hancock (4-2): The Orioles rolled to a 42-8 homecoming victory last Saturday behind a career-high 140 passing yards by senior quarterback Damon Biskupiak and a stout defensive effort. This week, they are looking for their third consecutive win against Hancock, which has also won two in a row. This is only the second road game of the season for MSD. \n6 p.m. today \nConcordia Prep (0-5) at SJCP (5-0-1): The Vikings put themselves in the driver’s seat to win the MIAA C Conference regular-season championship last week with a 28-18 home win over Annapolis Christian. The teams, which played to a 30-30 tie in the season opener in Annapolis, will likely meet again in the conference championship game in mid-November in Baltimore. Junior Marcus Waddy helped stem an Annapolis Christian rally last week with touchdown receptions of 48 and 75 yards and a number of big plays on defense. The Vikings won an earlier meeting with Concordia Prep this season on the road, 36-6. \n— Greg Swatek", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:50:25.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
