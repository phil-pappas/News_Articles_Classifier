REBEKAH PARSONS-KING/FAIRFAX NZ \nSecond place in open mens ski, Matt Sweet, throws down a massive trick. \nIt proved a tough ask for many - five riders fell and were forced to sit the rest of the event out in the blood bin. \nCompetitors had a few practice runs to get a feel for the jumps and four runs to impress the judges. \nAfter a few short delays, the event kicked off at 11.30am on Saturday. REBEKAH PARSONS-KING/Fairfax NZ \nSecond place in open mens board, Khaiya Raven, gets the biggest distance on the 60ft kicker. \nConditions were challenging, yet the stiff breeze didn't faze Khaiya Raven who took out the XXL Award for biggest distance on the hip. \nAside from the wind, the day was bluebird. \n\"Top speeds were around 35kmh - it stayed pretty consistent,\" Mt Ruapehu digital community coordinator, Anjelica Selis said. \"Sometimes we had a few gusts coming through but luckily it didn't pick up too much.\" \nSome athletes did approach the kickers with caution due to the gusts but they managed to wow spectators with an array of tricks. \n\"The competitors did amazing for the conditions,\" Selis said.\"They did really, really well. Some guys threw down some very big tricks and some people did play it safe but they ones that were throwing down, definitely threw down\". \nSelis said it was an \"amazing season\" and a great way to wrap it up. \nPodium winners :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:40:08.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
