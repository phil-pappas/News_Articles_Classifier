The fate of the undefeated Clifton girls soccer team rested largely in her hands. \nThe crowd was buzzing with anticipation all around her. The pressure undoubtedly was at its peak. And the focused and determined senior stared intently at the Lakeland shooter standing in front of her just a few yards away. \nFor a team with major Passaic County title aspirations, the second-seeded Mustangs admittedly didn’t expect it to have to come down to this in the county semifinals on Saturday. But here they were. \nEgyed answered the call on that shot and Clifton punched its ticket to the county final with a thrilling, 4-2 victory in penalty kicks after a scoreless, 100-minute game. \nOn Lakeland’s ensuing PK, following a converted strike from Clifton senior Olivia DeMuro, Egyed made a slightly less difficult, but celebration-igniting stop to seal the victory. \nLeading third-seeded Lakeland, 3-2, in the shootout after a combined five straight goals from the Mustangs and Lancers, Egyed — who started the season at center midfield — toed the goal line in her bright yellow keeper jersey. \n“I had a lot of faith our team would make their kicks,” said Egyed, who took over in net after the Mustangs’ season-opening starter suffered a concussion Sept. 22. “I was just thinking, ‘One save and we’ll win this.’ \n“I tried to relax, but I don’t know. There were a lot of things going through my head.” \nSeconds later, Egyed delivered a quick-reaction, laterally-moving save to her left to send the Mustangs bench and crowd into euphoria. \nIt wasn’t over, but the clutch denial “dictated the rest of the shootout,” coach Konrad Kruczek later said. \nIt was now Egyed’s moment in the varsity goaltending spotlight after years of watching her older sister, Rachel (2014 graduate), put together a record-breaking career in net with the Mustangs before moving on to Maryland. \n“I was thinking of how she would always tell me to ‘Get big’ on PKs,” the younger Egyed said following a seemingly endless series of hugs from virtually anyone who crossed her path during Saturday’s celebration at Wayne Valley. \n“She taught me how to spread out, how to move, how to react in these moments. She used to do all that and I learned that all from my sister.” \nEgyed’s two shootout saves (and nine in regula \ntion and OT), a shutdown defense anchored by Chelsea Robinson and four straight successful PK strikes from senior Brittany Morales, sophomore Meaghan Mancini, freshman Maria Orozco and DeMuro secured Clifton’s seventh straight trip to the PCT final. \nThe Mustangs will be chasing their first county title since 2012 after falling to Wayne Hills, 1-0, in the final the past two years. \n“I keep stressing to them how I don’t want to put any pressure on anyone on the PKs,” Kruczek said. “They figure it out on their own. They prepared for this [at Friday’s practice] and executed then. And they executed again very well today.” \nNo. 1 WAYNE HILLS 2, No. 4 WAYNE VALLEY 0: Meghan Griffin says she prepares differently than most for big games. \n“I’m more quiet and silent,” she said, laughing. “And then I let it all out.” \nBack in her first game after missing the last two with a hip flexor injury, the Wayne Hills senior let it all out to the tune of two goals, one in each half, to propel the two-time defending PCT champion Patriots back into the county final. \n“A three-peat sounds pretty nice at this point,” said Griffin, whose Pats will meet Clifton in Saturday’s final in a rematch after falling to the Mustangs, 2-1, in double overtime on Oct. 1. \nIt will also mark the fifth straight year these teams meet in the final. Griffin struck off an Olivia Prusakowski assist in the 16th minute Saturday and again off a Cameron Santers dish in the 47th. Goalie Siobhan O’Sullivan (seven saves) earned the shutout behind a defense featuring Deana Abdou, Callen Vander May and Prusakowski that limited the Indians’ offensive opportunities.
