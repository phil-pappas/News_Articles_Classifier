Fisher Correspondent dailycommercial.com | 0 comments \nMOUNT DORA — Mount Dora Christian Academy (0-7) was overpowered 48-0 by visiting First Academy of Leesburg (3-4) Friday night, surrendering the prized Orange Crate to their Coastal Orange Conference rivals. It was something that the seniors on the Eagles squad had never accomplished, but they did it in dominating fashion scoring on their first four possessions of the game to lead 27-0 at the half. \nThe Bulldogs showed early promise taking the opening possession on the legs of Jasper Pierre to the Eagles 20-yard line before stalling as the defensive front stiffened, forcing the Bulldogs’ Pierre to attempt his first pass of the game deep into the secondary where First Academy’s Tyler Cummings picked it off, returning it 42 yards near mid field. \nFrom there, the Eagles signal caller, Caleb Lynum, methodically moved the no-huddle offense for four first downs to position the Eagles on the Mount Dora 1 yard line and finally securing the lead for the Eagles on a keeper. Setting up for an apparent point-after kick, First Academy instead ran a run-pass option as ball holder Treavon Cummings took the snap and rolling to his left to draw in the defenders tossed the conversion pass to a wide open Dude Edwards and the 8-0 lead. \nAfter forcing a quick punt by Mount Dora that gave them possession at their own 35-yard line the Eagles quickly extended their lead to 14-0 as Lynum connected with Cummings for a 37-yard gainer and then burst 28 yards for the touchdown. Lynum’s point after attempt failed \nSetting up near mid field after a quick three-and-out by the hosts Cummings pulled in a Lynum dart and negotiated through the Bulldog secondary until he found the end zone 52 yards later and Leesburg was up 21-0 after Mario Hernandez connected on the PAT. \nOn the Eagles possession it was all Caleb Lynum as he hit Kanyon Walker for 16 yard gain and rushed 3 times for 21 yards, including the final 1-yard sneak for the touchdown and a 27-0 halftime lead. \nThe second half was just as difficult as the first for the Bulldogs, although they were able to slow the Eagles down early as Matthew Liles was able to recover a Lynum fumble at the Mount Dora 10 yard line when it appeared that First Academy was about to score. But the Bulldogs were unable to move the ball and was forced to punt. Facing a 3rd and 10 at the Bulldog 27 yard line after misfiring on consecutive passes Lynum connected with Cummings for a third Eagle touchdown and the 34-0 lead midway through the 3rd quarter. \nLynum and Cummings would connect one last time for 43-yard score and lead 41-0 they entered the final segment under a running clock. The final of 48-0 came on a lineman’s dream play as Roderick Bedford picked up the loose football deep in the Bulldog backfield and ran untouched 20-yards for the touchdown and Hernandez tacked on the final point to secure the sought after Orange Crate for First Academy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:31:46.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
