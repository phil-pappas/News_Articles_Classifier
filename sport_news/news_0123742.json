Since that day the Lady Bears haven't lost a game and the afternoon of Oct. 8 marked a classic case of revenge. \n\"This date (Oct. 8) was marked on the calendar after opening night,\" said Lyndhurst coach Kimberley Hukey, whose team exacted their revenge with a convincing 6-1 victory. \nThe Bears relied heavily on the performance of their top forward, Mia Luna, who would finish the day with four goals. Luna has been coming on of late for her team, who had their biggest victories this past week, an upset win over Indian Hills in the county tournament and this one over New Milford. \n\"Her confidence is just growing and growing with each game,\" Hukey said of Luna. \nIn the first half Luna scored just eight minutes into the game, giving her team a 1-0 lead. The Knights came right back moments later to tie the match thanks to the ever-dangerous Alexis Monroy. \nScoring \nThe score would remain knotted at 1-1 until midway through the second half when there was a deluge of goals by the Bears. \nAmanda Fulcher scored on a 25-yard direct kick to give Lyndhurst their second lead of the game, this time at 2-1. After Fulcher's goal Luna would take care of the next eight minutes of play. \nAt around the 19-minute mark Fulcher stole a ball and played it ahead to Luna, who banged it into the back of the net for the 3-1 lead. A mere five minutes later Luna headed in a corner kick from Fulcher. \nThen, just a few minutes later, Fulcher again found Luna, this time on a clear breakaway. Luna easily placed it past the goalkeeper and let out a huge sigh of relief as the ball rolled over the goal line. \n\"I knew when I scored that one the game was over,\" she said after her tally made the score 5-1. \nFulcher, however, wasn't yet finished. At the six-minute mark of the second half she scored on a breakaway, finishing her day with two goals and three assists. \nA relief \nThe Bears were very relieved, especially with all the concentration and effort they put into this particular game. \n\"I just can't believe we actually beat them,\" said Luna. \"I had so many butterflies in my stomach at the beginning of this game.\" \nFor the Knights the sentiment was a little different after the game. Due to a rash of injuries to some of his defensemen coach Joe Albanese had to juggle his lineup throughout the game. \nBut that offered no excuse for the performance. \n\"They (Lyndhurst) played great and absolutely deserved to win,\" he said. \"For us it's just about getting some girls healthy and getting back to playing our style of soccer.\" \nThe Bears will enjoy this win as they are now tied with New Milford atop the league standings. \n\"The kids were excited to get this win, especially coming off the big county win the other day,\" said Hukey. \nE-mail: baumuller@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:22.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
