The Briton has won two of the three races in Austin to date and three of the last four in the United States.\nVettel has won three grands prix this year, the same number as Rosberg, and he and Hamilton are the only drivers to have won in Austin since it first hosted the championship in 2012.\nThe German, who won his four world championships with Red Bull, has also started twice on pole in Texas.\nThe new engine will be Vettel's fifth of the season, incurring a penalty because it exceeds the allocation of four.\nFinnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen will take a similar penalty, which will further reduce Ferrari's chances of beating Mercedes unless the weather, which is expected to be wet, intervenes.\n\"The priority was always to have maximum power at every single race and that has been our plan and I think it worked very well so far,\" said the German.\n\"Obviously we have to take the hit here but then we should see the positive and the fact we were able to make big steps.\"\n(Editing by Tony Jimenez )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:10:42.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
