There is defense to play, rebounding to do, dirty work to provide — all of them issues fourth-year coach Bruce Weber addressed Tuesday at Sprint Center during Big 12 Media Day. \n“His best attributes on the offensive end are definitely his shooting, facing up, shooting the 15-, 17-footer, even out to 3,’’ Weber said regarding the range Hurt possesses. “So we’ve got to get him baskets, get him open so he can shoot the ball. \n“At the same time, we’ve been on him. He has to be a presence on the defensive end inside. He is our big body. He’s going to have to deal with the contact, clog the lane up. He’s going to have to rebound.’’ \nThe Wildcats would like for their center to live up to his nickname, Big Hurt. \nA year ago after transferring from Northwest Florida Junior College, the former Lipscomb signee struggled to adjust. He averaged 4.7 points and 2.8 rebounds, but flashed some promise with a 15-point outing to boost K-State past Oklahoma in Norman. \nDuring a recent scrimmage, Weber said Hurt led the Cats in rebounds. \n“He’s not one those flying-around guys that are going to be getting these dunks and all these rebounds,’’ said Weber, “but he has to be solid.’’ \nThe defensive backboards will be a higher priority for Hurt after the Cats lost their top rebounders, Thomas Gipson and Nino Williams. \n“That’s a big portion of our team, the overall boards that are gone,’’ Hurt said. “It’s going to be a major emphasis of mine this year, to clean the glass up real well.’’ \nHurt should get some help underneath from D.J. Johnson, though the 6-9 junior must bounce back from two foot surgeries. Any other height to use inside comes from newcomers such as 6-10 St. John freshman Dean Wade. \nThe mystery that surrounds the Wildcats is something Hurt and his teammates hope to spin into a positive following a 15-17 finish that kept K-State out of the postseason a year ago when it went 1-10 on the road and 8-10 in the Big 12. \n“You definitely expect us to compete hard, every night, every day,’’ Hurt said. “It starts in practice. We’re going to play hard defensively, smooth offensively and do what we have to do to get wins.’’ \nFor Hurt, that means achieving a higher level of conditioning, something he said he managed over the offseason. That could make him a bigger contributor, on both ends, but don’t look for him to remove the trademark goggles. He wears them for protection after suffering a torn iris while playing juco basketball. \n“It was kind of scary having a major eye injury, but it’s fine now. I just have to protect it and wear the goggles,’’ Hurt said. “I had to get used to them. They get foggy and sweaty, and I have to clean them off a lot. Shooting through them, it was different, so it was an adjustment and I don’t notice them as much.’’ \nUGLY WINS OK — Gaining confidence is key for the Cats coming off a losing season, and after losing all but one starter, junior forward Wesley Iwundu. \nAs an example, Weber cited the 55-0 loss K-State suffered in football against Oklahoma as “a letdown’’ stemming from narrow defeats the previous two weeks. \nAs for his team, “you win some games early, and they can be ugly, but you win them, and you start feeling good about yourself. That goes a long way as you get into the season.’’ \nLAST YEAR OVER — Weber repeated a stance he shared at K-State’s media day regarding the need to forget about last season. \n“The biggest thing is we don’t need negativity,’’ Weber said. “Part of the good positive energy is being focused on what’s at hand.’’ \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:24:29.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
