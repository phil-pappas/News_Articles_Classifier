I feel incredibly fortunate to have this car. \n“I love going to Austin – the track has been amazing for me since the first race. I am looking forward to it. It is a track where you can race and get close to people.” \nHamilton joined the team in their celebrations after retaining the constructors’ championship at Sochi. “It was great to catch up with the team back at the factories and to celebrate together,” he said. \n“I can’t say enough how grateful I am for all their hard work and it’s important that we relish these moments. Austin is one of the highlights of the season for me – I love going to the ‘States and I spend a lot of time here – so I am really looking forward to it \n“But I’ve learned from experience in this sport that nothing is ever done until it’s done – so I am taking nothing for granted. I’ll approach the race in the same way as all the others this year. \n“I know there are four races left for me to get this championship tied up and, as long as it’s done by the time I cross the line in Abu Dhabi, that’s what really counts.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:53:50.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
