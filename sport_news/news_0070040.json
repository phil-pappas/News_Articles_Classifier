Sabathia, the 2007 AL Young Award winner, said he took the step to receive the care he needs and become the kind of person \"I can be proud of.\" \n\"I love baseball and I love my teammates like brothers, and I am also fully aware that I am leaving at a time when we should all be coming together for one last push toward the World Series,\" the 35-year-old left-hander said. \"It hurts me deeply to do this now, but I owe it to myself and to my family to get myself right. I want to take control of my disease, and I want to be a better man, father and player.\" \nSabathia informed manager Joe Girardi on Sunday in Baltimore, where the Yankees finished the regular season. \n\"The first thing he said is, 'I need help,'\" Girardi said. \"I was shocked.\" \nSabathia is 214-129 in 15 major-league seasons and was 6-10 with a 4.73 ERA this year, slowed by his surgically repaired right knee. After returning from the disabled list and using a tighter brace, the 300-pound-plus pitcher was 2-1 with a 2.17 ERA in his last five starts and got the win against Boston last week that clinched the Yankees' return to the postseason following a rare two-year absence. \nSabathia signed a $161 million, seven-year contract with the Yankees before the 2009 season. \nGirardi and general manager Brian Cashman talked about the pitcher's decision in the stadium interview room in front of a Major League Baseball banner for the AL wild-card game that advertised \"presented by Budweiser.\" \n\"CC Sabathia made an important life decision and we are fully supportive of his seeking treatment,\" MLB said in a statement. \"This situation involving an individual player should not in any way impact baseball's relationship with Budweiser, a longtime valued partner that constantly promotes drinking responsibly.\" \nNationals fire Williams: Manager Matt Williams was fired by the Washington Nationals after a season in which the team went from World Series favorite to failing to make the playoffs. \nThe club announced the move a day after finishing the regular season barely above .500 at 83-79, second to the New York Mets in the NL East. \n\"This entire season was a disappointment,\" general manager Mike Rizzo said. \"It wasn't Matt's best year. It wasn't my best year. As an organization, it wasn't our best year. All of us, together, feel the disappointment.\" \nWilliams is gone after only two seasons in his first job as a skipper in the majors. Last year, he was voted NL Manager of the Year after the Nationals finished with the best record in the league. In February, the Nationals exercised his 2016 contract option. \nA's promote Beane, Forst: The Oakland Athletics wanted to make sure they could keep David Forst in the front office after other clubs sought to hire him, so they promoted him to general manager and elevated Billy Beane to executive vice president of baseball operations. \nForst just completed his 16th years with the low-budget franchise and 12th as assistant GM, though Beane insists his right-hand man has been assuming general manager duties behind the scenes for some time.
