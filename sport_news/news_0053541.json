(Getty Images) \nNoah Syndergaard is the 100-mph-fastball throwing pitcher for the Mets that helped his team take Game 2 of the NLCS against the Cubs, going 5 2/3 innings and striking out nine batters. But you may know him simply as \"Thor.\" \nIt's not difficult to see how he got the nickname. Flowing locks? Check. Chiseled bod? Check. A fastball that moves at the speed of Thor's almighty hammer Mjolnir? Check. \nSo you may find it surprising that he didn't always look like the 6-foot-2 Norse god. In eighth grade, he was a self-described \"chunkster.\" From lfpress.com : \"Back in eighth grade I was a chunkster, kids would tease me for being overweight,\" said Syndergaard. He came home from school one day in Mansfield, Tex., told his father he wanted to join the YMCA and eat healthier. So, he worked out at the Y, ate his veggies, worked out some more and, oh yeah, had a growth spurt from 5-foot-11 to his current height. \nDon't believe him? Here's some photo evidence of Syndergaard's awkward tween phase: Remember: this guy can now throw 101. Anything is possible. pic.twitter.com/6N6lU7mUdT - Ben Reiter (@SI_BenReiter) October 19, 2015 \nNow, if you'll excuse, I think I need to hit the Y and east some more veggies. \n[h/t Deadspin ] \n* * * Cy Brown writes about soccer and other stuff for Sports on Earth.
