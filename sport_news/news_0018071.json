The law declared this investment in infrastructure “essential to the national interest.”\nDuring my September address to the Domenici Public Policy Conference, I noted that the world once envied our transportation systems, and rightly so. The United States built the first transcontinental railroad and interstate highway system, which provided the support system for immense economic growth.\nBut, today, the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report for 2014/2015 ranks us 16th in the quality of overall infrastructure. Can we compete in a global economy from 16th place?\nAndrew Herrmann, former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, spoke to the conference about the ASCE Report Card on America’s Infrastructure. His former agency regularly examines the state of the nation’s infrastructure, breaking it down into 16 categories, including aviation, education, roads, bridges and flood control.\nASCE then assigns a letter grade to each category, both nationally and for each state.\nAs you would expect, an A is exceptional, a C is mediocre and an F is failing.\nWhile I encourage you to review their entire report online, you should know the nation’s overall GPA is a D+. New Mexico fared slightly better with a C.\nJust from news reports and personal experience, Americans know that bridges, airports and roadways are congested and in poor condition. We know that, if the U.S. is to remain viable in a global economy, we have to invest more to improve and expand our infrastructure across all forms.\nSo, if we know it and our elected representatives know it, why do we seem complacent?\nIn 1956, there was a cohesive national goal. While it wasn’t an easy undertaking and met its share of resistance, the interstate highway system was a history-making endeavor largely championed by the public, for the public good.\nAnd the public trust – investor confidence – was resolute. It hadn’t yet been eroded by decades of earmarking and misuse of transportation funding for special state projects.\nToday, great political leadership with an aptitude for collaboration and compromise is needed. This leadership must unite the public with a common goal, and clearly illustrate that investment in infrastructure will boost our economy and create jobs.\nWith this leadership, the public trust must be restored and a vision “essential to the national interest” must unite us.\nDomenici Conference speakers on infrastructure, to include Andrew Herrmann, Samara Barend of AECOM Capital and myself, highlighted the problems and pointed to solutions for a path forward. But without the political will and a common goal for our nation, our infrastructure challenges will continue to impede our economic growth, restrict U.S. competitiveness and challenge the safety of everyday transportation.\nAmerica can do better.\nMary E. Peters served as U.S. Secretary of Transportation from 2006 to 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:40:38.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
