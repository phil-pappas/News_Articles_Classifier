Don't get the well-bearded 29-year-old who led the majors with 22 wins and posted an 0.75 ERA after the All-Star break - no, that's not a typo - wrong. He wasn't guaranteeing victory so much as trying to savor a moment he believed would come even if others did not. \nThe tall right-hander who never seemed to fit in early in his career in Baltimore has supplanted Jon Lester as Chicago's No. 1 starter. \nWhen he's on, Arrieta is borderline unhittable. The Pirates managed a lone single off him in a 4-0 Cubs' win on Sept. 27 and Arrieta has allowed four earned runs combined since Aug. 1. \nThat success has sent his confidence soaring. There isn't any one thing that's changed from those difficult years with the Orioles. He simply matured, tweaking his delivery and his mental approach. It's all about the now. Not the last pitch. Not the next one. This one. \nIn that sense, Arrieta will face a kindred spirit in Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole . \nUnlike Arrieta, a late bloomer, Cole has been groomed for this stage from the day the Pirates took him with the first overall pick in the 2011 draft. He hasn't missed a beat any step of the way and made the All-Star team for the first time this summer while becoming the first Pittsburgh pitcher to reach 19 victories since 1991. \n''He respects everything about the game but he fears absolutely nothing,'' Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. ''That's a wonderful place to be.'' \nA destination that took some work for Cole to arrive at. The fire that so visibly fuels him - few pitcher in baseball take their jobs so personally - would sometimes singe Cole during his first two years in the league. Not anymore. \nCatchers Francisco Cervelli and Chris Stewart have learned to quickly decipher when Cole is in need of a reset. At that moment they leap out of their crouch to give the 25-year-old a pep talk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:27:30.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
