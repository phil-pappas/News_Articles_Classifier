We know how much he cares about Sammamish. He’s always gone above and beyond to work for a better city. \nYears ago, he provided some of the political push to get the King County Library System to build a new library in Sammamish. \nHe worked hard to make sure the Community and Aquatic Center was built, providing activities for so many families: young children, teens, adults and seniors. We know he is proud that the new facility is being built during his time as mayor. \nWhether working with the Lake Washington Schools Foundation Advisory Board or promoting the Issaquah Schools Foundation Healthy Youth Initiative, Tom has always been eager to help our local schools succeed. Last spring, he was honor to be a special guest at the Eastlake and Tesla STEM high school graduations. \nTom worked to bridge the divide that had developed between Sammamish and Issaquah, mostly over the Klahanie annexation. His interaction with their leadership helped to turn that situation into a win for all concerned: Sammamish and Klahanie residents can now look forward to better commutes to I-90, and all Sammamish and Issaquah residents can now rely on leadership working together to improve local and regional transportation and work together on many other important issues. \nTom worked to bring Sammamish into the regional King County-Cities Climate Coalition that finds ways to use cleaner energy and create a more resilient region, saving money and promoting a healthier environment. \nTom recently pushed for a new multi-modal transportation safety plan that could make streets, intersections, sidewalks, and pathways safer for everyone: walking, biking, or driving. \nThis is easy. We will be voting to re-elect Tom Vance to his council seat, because, like Tom, we want Sammamish to remain a great place to live. \nPenny and David Short \nWritten by Contributed · Filed Under Letters to the Editor , Opinion \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:41:34.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
