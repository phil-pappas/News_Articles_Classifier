This decision was taken by the Sikh clergy following a meeting held at Akal Takht earlier in the day. An emergency meeting was called at Akal Takht to discuss the issue in view of the growing resentment among Sikhs over the grant of pardon to the Dera chief on the charge of wearing attire similar to that of Guru Gobind Singh. While the Jathedar of Takht Sri Hazoor Sahib could not attend the meeting of the top clergy, his views were taken over phone before pronouncing the withdrawal of pardon, according to sources. Fearing a violent reaction from Sikh activists and students of various educational institutions, the SGPC also postponed its executive committee meeting that was scheduled to be held at Fatehgarh Sahib. Meanwhile, two executive committee members, Mangal Singh and Bhajan Singh Shergill, in Fatehgarh Sahib demanded the resignation of the five head priests for “hurting the sentiments of the community by issuing the edict” in favour of the Dera chief. In Amritsar, the Akal Takht Jathedar on Friday said the hukumnama pardoning the Dera chief on September 24 stood withdrawn as it had invited severe criticism and had not been not accepted by the Panth. Earlier, SGPC general secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhaur and executive member Karnail Singh Panjoli had expressed their resentment over the pardon. SGPC chief Avtar Singh Makkar blamed the Kotkapura administration and the intelligence wing of the Punjab Police for the incidents of violence at Bargadi and the law and order problem in the state. In Nawanshahr, SGPC member Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa announced his resignation from the post of SAD district general secretary over the recent issues related to the Sikh community. The developments regarding the Dera and the subsequent desecration of a ‘bir’ or Guru Granth Sahib and the death of two protesters in police firing have triggered a strong reaction among Sikhs in Punjab as well as abroad. The Shiromani Akali Dal leadership had been accused of having engineered the 'pardon' to the Dera chief for electoral gains from the followers of the Sirsa-based sect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:55:50.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
