He was suspended two games by Major League Baseball. \nUtley appealed the suspension , though, and remained eligible to play for the remainder of the NLDS (that New York won). \nUtley's scheduled hearing was October 19 but it's since been pushed back to a later, undetermined date in 2015 if not spring 2016. If Utley loses the appeal he will be out for two games next season. PLUS : Despite crazy October, Mets still unlikely to re-sign Daniel Murphy, report says \nUtley was traded to the Dodgers earlier this season from the Phillies and became an instant pariah in New York when sliding hard into Tejada to break up a double play in Game 2 of the NLDS. Some argued the slide was more of a tackle, and Major League Baseball seemed to agree, coming down relatively hard on the 36-year-old. \nUtley is signed through the 2016 season for $15 million or a $2 million buyout. If he landed on another team before the start of the season, he'd still have to serve the suspension. \nRyan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @ryanhatch .
