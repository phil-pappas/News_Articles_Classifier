Cassella at a press conference concerning online daily games in East Rutherford on Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015. With the MetLife Stadium, home of the Giants and Jets, as a backdrop, three elected officials on Tuesday  decred the lack of governmental oversight of the growing daily fantasy sports industry.\n“Daily fantasy sports is an industry crying for consumer protection,” said U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Monmouth. “Despite its explosion in popularity and the allegation of ‘insider trading’ by employees of daily fantasy sports operators, the industry is operating in a void within the legal structure – without any regulation or the necessary transparency.”\nU.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, also a Democrat, concurred.\nRelated:   N.J. lawmakers urge federal regulators to review daily fantasy sports \n“I have serious concerns about whether these online fantasy sports leagues can police themselves,” Menendez said. \"This is about fairness and ensuring a level playing field for fantasy sports fans. There’s a lot of money at stake, and these sites are drawing in tons of players. These players should know they aren’t being duped.”\nThe daily fantasy sports industry leaders – six-year-old FanDuel and three-year-old DraftKings — each have raised tens of millions in venture capital in the past two years while agreeing to marketing partnerships with major professional sports leagues and most individual franchises.\nAmong them are the Jets, whose deal with FanDuel includes its branding of fantasy sports updates on the MetLife Stadium scoreboard, and the Giants, who have an agreement with DraftKings. The Jets’ deal also includes a weekly fantasy preview by a FanDuel expert on the Jets’ official website.\nNFL officials say these partnerships are not “sponsorships” because the fantasy companies cannot use NFL team logos on their websites or claim to be an official NFL sponsor in their advertising. But both companies have advertised heavily during televised NFL games, and several teams have brokered deals with the companies for the naming rights to stadium lounges where fans can get frequent status updates on their chosen players.\nDaily fantasy sports contests have multiplied rapidly in the last year as companies have taken advantage of the fact that fantasy sports was exempted from a 2006 federal law designed to otherwise make it illegal for gambling payments to be processed online. At the time, most fantasy sports contests were arranged informally among groups of friends and lasted for an entire season of four to six months, with most or all of the payoff coming when the season concluded. DraftKings and FanDuel charge an entry fee to let fans pick new rosters of players every day or week to play against dozens or hundreds of competitors. The companies say prize pools can reach up to $2 million.\nLate last month, a daily fantasy sports site called rotogrinders.com revealed that a DraftKings employee had publicly posted a list of which players were being chosen most often in fantasy games — information that could be used to improve a competitor’s odds of winning prizes. The employee won $350,000 in a single FanDuel football event that weekend.\nThe news prompted widespread calls for regulation of the fledgling industry, which has been operating in 45 states where the games are considered to be contests of skill. Pallone and Menendez wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission last week asking it to look into the issue.\nPallone is the chief sponsor of a bill, which has yet to come up for a vote in Congress, that would amend a 1992 federal law to add New Jersey as the second state - along with Nevada - to permit extensive sports betting at state racetracks and casinos. On another front, the state has asked the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals for a rehearing of its case following a recent 2-1 ruling that upheld the continued ban on such gambling.\nEmail: brennan@northjersey.com Blog: northjersey.com/brennan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:55:50.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
