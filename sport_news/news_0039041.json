Friday’s game is completely sold out.\nWe’ve spent the last few days looking back at the history of the Battle of the Lake Rivalry. Now it’s time to start looking ahead to Friday.\nSports editor Michael Adams has seen both Westlake and Lake Travis several times this year and has come up with his keys to the game for both teams.\nDefensive tackle Tevin Paul, getting past the block of Mychael Perry, called this the best spring he’s been involved with at Lake Travis’ spring game. Paul and Lake Travis’ defensive line caused a lot of problems for Westlake. Sports editor Michael Adams thinks the Cavs need to follow the same formula. KEYS FOR WESTLAKE\nW in battle in the trenches : Westlake has to keep Lake Travis’ big defensive line away from quarterback Sam Ehlinger. Last year, the Cavaliers got to Ehlinger 13 times, initially making the UT pledge a non-factor. Strike first and don’t let up: Westlake is commonly a slow starting team aside from a 38-point explosion against Anderson and a 20-0 run against Hays last week. Take those two games away and the Chaps are only outscoring opponents 22-21 in the first quarter. Westlake can’t give up a big lead in the first quarter and expect to get out of it against a defense like Lake Travis’. Which leads me into the next key to the game for the Chaps. Make it a four quarter game: If the game is close going into the fourth quarter, my money is on Westlake to get the win. Yes, Lake Travis has made fourth quarter comebacks before in this game. But it’s 2015 and Westlake has much more experience than the Cavs playing a full-four quarter game. Stop Abe Willows and Santiago Villegas : Lake Travis is very deep at the running back position with Willows and Villegas. Head coach Hank Carter knows his passing game is against arguably the best secondary it will see until late in the playoff, so the Cavs potentially could rely on its run game. Not many teams have slowed down this duo, but Westlake’s defensive line has all the tools. KEYS FOR LAKE TRAVIS\nStay with what works : The Cavaliers need to follow last year’s formula for success and apply unholy amounts of pressure on Westlake quarterback Sam Ehlinger. The Cavaliers’ pass rush can’t give Ehlinger time to throw the ball or room to run. Don’t give up too many big plays: The Chaps rely on its ability to explode for big plays offensively and have a lot of weapons in skill positions. The Cavs will have to slow this down as much as possible. Lake Travis secondary will be outmatched against Westlake’s wide receivers, so limiting the big play is crucial. Get out to a big lead : Westlake is commonly a slow starting team. If Lake Travis explodes in the first quarter, they potentially could create a big enough deficit that Westlake can’t overcome. Win the battle at the line: This game will be won at the line of scrimmage.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/21/23/79/05-22-15_0857.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:03:50.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
