The Cardinals had the best record in the majors this season, don’t forget. One hundred wins, and bye-bye, birdie.\nThink anybody wants to play these crazy Cubs right now? Not in baseball, my friend.\nThere was, too, the vanquishing of pitcher John Lackey, a mighty foe who was dominant in St. Louis’ Game 1 win.\nGoing on three days rest was noble. But in the end Lackey’s four earned runs in just three innings of work — including a stunning three-run home run to sub Javy Baez — made him just so much more road kill on the Cubs’ march to relevance and beyond.\nWhat else?\nWell, the idea that you can’t win with rookies and young guys was slain dead as a shingle.\nAt last glance, Cubs Kris Bryant, Jorge Soler (oh, what a gorgeous throw home he made in the sixth inning to nail a Cardinals baserunner!), Kyle Schwarber, Baez and the injured Addison Russell are young guys. Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro aren’t what you’d call old, either.\nThen there is the idea that you can’t have fun if you’re dedicated to winning. The Cubs couldn’t have more fun if they were tied up and tickled.\nChampagne blasting all over the place, with disco lights and plastic sheets everywhere, has become a Cubbie signature move. The joyous party last night that started immediately after Cubs pitcher Hector Rondon struck out Stephen Piscotty for the last out in the ninth inning ballooned to the pitchers mound, then into the clubhouse, then back onto the field like a living blob.\nThere were ski goggles, silly hats, and, then…cigars.\nBlue smoke wafted from the stogies of relief pitcher Fernando Rodney and pals, drifting over the onfield scene like mustard gas (that is, if you don’t like cigar smoke).\nWhat were they? From Cuba? From the Dominican Republic, like Rodney?\nThe man with the bleached blond top fuzz, one of the eight pitchers who helped the Cubs win this game, shrugged. Somebody handed them out, he said.\n“It’s nice.’’\nThat’s an excellent phrase to describe this Cubs reversal of so much bad fortune from the past. Indeed, this current winning streak — 49-19, counting the playoffs, since July 29 — is almost hallucinatory in its heft. This wasn’t supposed to be the Cubs’ year. It was supposed to be next year, or the year after. Like always.\nBut now it’s upon us, and the Cubs have moved on to the National League Championship Series, which is so close to the promised land as to be almost terrifying.\nBut then so was 22-year old Kyle Schwarber’s mighty home run blast in the seventh inning. That ball sailed up and out of our sight and apparently went over the massive Budweiser video board in right field.\nThe muscular, squat left-handed-hitting Schwarber — can we call him mini-Ruth? — destroyed the pitch to the extent that if somebody said the ball simply exploded and vanished — well, you’d have to listen to that person.\n“It went over the board,’’ said manager Joe Maddon afterward, looking toward the direction of Sheffield Ave. “I thought it did.’’\n“We were all looking straight at it,’’ said Joe’s dad, Greg, who was seated in the lower grandstand with family, “and I don’t where it went.’’\n“I think it did,’’ said Bryant when asked if the ball cleared that 50-foot tall barrier some 370 feet from home plate.\nGood Lord.\n“It’s been a crazy ride,’’ said Schwarber of his ascent from college ball to this level in less than a year.\nHis homer was a crazy ride, too — one that he actually called, Babe Ruth-style. Good Lord, again.\n“Yeah. I said (to teammate Dexter Fowler), ‘I’m going to hit a home run off this guy.’ And he’s like, ‘Well, do it!’ There you go.’’\nThere we go. There it went.\nAnd here come, at last, the Cubs.\nFollow me on Twitter @ricktelander\nEmail: rtelander@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:14:50.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
