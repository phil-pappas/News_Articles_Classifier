Maryville received all 15 first-place votes from the panel of voters to keep the top spot, while Blair Oaks was one third-place ballot away from receiving all second-place votes. \nThe Jays, meanwhile, remained in the fifth spot in the Class 6 rankings, where C.B.C. continues to hold down the top spot as a unanimous pick. \nJefferson City did cause some shakeup in Class 5, however, with its win against Battle last Friday. With then-No. 2 Battle and then-No. 1 Fort Osage both losing, they fell into a tie for third. The new No. 1 in Class 5 is Staley, getting 14 of 15 first-place votes, with Fort Zumwalt North getting the other No. 1 vote and holding down the second spot. \nThe other No. 1 spots remained the same, with Webb City in Class 4, Lamar in Class 2 and Valle Catholic in Class 1 joining C.B.C. and Maryville as unanimous top picks. ï»¿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:00:12.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
