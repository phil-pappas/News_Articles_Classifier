(AP) - The Croydon School Board and Select Board are preparing for a possible fight with the Attorney General's office over their decision to continue using tax money to pay for some students' tuition at private schools.\nBased on a Sept. 8 letter from the state, the town has until Monday to stop using public funds to pay for those students. It's not clear what the state's next step would be.\nThe board says no law's been broken.\nCroydon's one school goes up through the fourth grade. The board began the process several years ago of ending an agreement to send schoolchildren to Newport under a plan that listed private schools as options. The plan went into effect last year.\nFive children in Croydon attend the Newport Montessori School; the rest attend public schools.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:01:43.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
