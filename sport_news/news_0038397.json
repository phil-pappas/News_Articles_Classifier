Lions, who have a game in hand. They also have the Montreal Alouettes (in a possible crossover) to worry about. \nWith a win, the RedBlacks can lock up a playoff spot -- the first time an Ottawa CFL team will be in the playoffs since the 1994 Rough Riders did it. \n\"It's a big deal,\" said RedBlacks coach Rick Campbell on Wednesday. \"We want to win as many games as we can. These last four (games of the regular season), we know they're all going to be tough. Every team is going to be fighting for their lives and fighting for playoff spots. We're one of those teams and we can't wait to get out here Friday.\" \nThe RedBlacks will have one big lineup change. With running back Jeremiah Johnson out for the remainder of the season with a dislocated foot, William Powell steps into the starting lineup. \n\"William has a very similar skillset to Jeremiah,\" said Campbell. \"He can do a lot of similar things. From what I've seen so far, I don't think we'll miss a beat with him.\" \nThe Blue Bombers come into town on a high after beating the Lions 29-26 on a final-play 41-yard field goal by newcomer Sergio Castillo. Winnipeg trailed 23-9 at the half, but fought back with special teams a big factor. The Bombers had a blocked convert, a blocked punt and pulled off a successful fake punt. \nThey've also got a quarterback, Matt Nichols, who will face the RedBlacks for the fourth time this season. Before being traded to the Bombers, he was the starting QB for the Eskimos in two wins over the RedBlacks. \n\"We're getting to see too much of him,\" said Campbell with a laugh. \"He's more of a pocket passer, a good thrower, but I don't think he gets enough credit for what he does with his legs, too. He's an all-around good player.\" \nHere are the scenarios going into Friday night's Ottawa RedBlacks vs. Winnipeg Blue Bombers game at TD Place: \n-- A RedBlacks win and they are in the playoffs for the first time since 1994 (as they have won the season series over Montreal). Even with a loss vs. Winnipeg, a Montreal loss on Sunday would also put Ottawa into the playoffs as the worst that Ottawa could be is 8-10 and the best Montreal mark would be 8-10. Even if the RedBlacks end up tied with Montreal at 9-9, they survive as they have won the season series over Montreal and would also survive a three-way tie among Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal (based on record among tied teams). Current standings affecting a three-way TOR, OTT, MTL (common record): Tor 4-0, Ott 3-3, Mtl 0-4. One game left (Tor vs Mtl). \n-- A Blue Bombers win in this game would put them in third place at 6-10. B.C. would have two games in hand, but then be forced to win at least two more out of their four remaining games as the Blue Bombers hold the 2015 tiebreaker (2-0 season series win). The Lions' schedule is by far the hardest among themselves, Winnipeg and Montreal. The four B.C. opponents have a combined winning percentage of .690.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:54:37.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
