ARMAS AP Sports Writer   5:36   5:37   \nPeople: \nWisconsin (555) \n\nMADISON, Wisconsin — For nearly three quarters, Purdue was trailing by just one score on the road in a homecoming weekend game that initially had all the makings of a blowout. \nIt was only a matter of time before Wisconsin's offense could catch up with the production of the Badgers' stout defense. \nAlec Ingold ran for two short scores, Joel Stave threw for 322 yards and Wisconsin held Purdue to a season-low 191 yards in a 24-7 victory on Saturday. \nThe Badgers (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten) overcame several penalties and other mistakes in the red zone. They led just 10-7 late in the third quarter until two rushing touchdowns in an eight-minute span between the third and fourth quarters. \nPurdue (1-6, 0-3) lost its fifth straight game. \nAsked if it was tough for Boilermakers fans to see progress in the program, third-year coach Darrell Hazell said \"I'm sure it is for a lot of people who don't see what we see when they look at the won-loss record.\" \nAfter the second touchdown, T.J. Edwards forced the Boilermakers' Markell Jones to fumble at the Purdue 43. Safety Tanner McEvoy pounced on the ball with 7:03 left to seal the win for the Badgers. \nEdwards, one of two freshmen starting at inside linebacker for Wisconsin, finished with 16 tackles. \n\"This defense, the reason it's playing well is they don't care about the numbers. They care about playing together and being a part of a good defense,\" coach Paul Chryst said. \nPurdue's only score came on David Blough's 2-yard quarterback keeper in the second quarter to cap the worst stretch of the afternoon for Wisconsin. Purdue capitalized after Leroy Clark intercepted Stave at the 5 and returned the ball 66 yards. \nBlough's score tied the game at 7. Just like two weeks ago in a 24-21 loss at Michigan State, the Boilermakers had designs of pulling off an unlikely upset on the road before falling short. \nThe effort to simplify the offense this week for redshirt freshman Blough produced few results. Blough was 15 of 26 for 136 yards, picking up chunks of yardage late in the fourth quarter with the game well in hand for Wisconsin. \nA 39-yard touchdown pass by Blough with 1:09 left was called back by a holding penalty. \n\"People can look at the 1-6 and say whatever they want. It is tough but nobody is in there pointing fingers,\" Blough said. \nHazell pointed to poor showings on third downs (4 of 13) and bad field position, with Purdue's second-half drives on average starting at the 22. \nStill, It took a while before Wisconsin could assert control. \nThe running game could only amass 96 yards against a Purdue defense that was giving up a Big Ten-worst 215 yards a game on the ground. \nBut the Badgers got production in the red zone from their tailbacks. \nDare Ogunbowale ran for 56 yards on 18 carries and a 4-yard touchdown run on the last play of the third quarter for a 17-7 lead. \nIngold, a freshman, powered his way for a 1-yard score after breaking a tackle at the 3 with 7:16 left in the game. He finished with 19 yards on nine carries. \nAside from his bad throw that led to the pick, Stave was solid and finished 30 of 39. The Badgers moved the ball through the air to set up their tailbacks. \n\"Any time you commit so many guys to the box in the run game you've got to be really good in the back end,\" Hazell said. \nStave connected with seven different receivers, led by nine catches for 86 yards for Alex Erickson. \n__ \nFollow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:48:09.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
