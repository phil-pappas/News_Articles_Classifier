The Mean Green have lost four straight to open the season, including their first two games in Conference USA play. UNT will face Western Kentucky and Marshall in its next two games after facing the Vikings and could be looking at an 0-7 start, if it can't beat Portland State, a team that competes in the Football Championship Subdivision. UNT is paying Portland State a $425,000 guarantee to come to Denton to play. It would be a tough turn of events for the Mean Green to fork over the kind of money without getting the win they need.\nPortland State has a chance to show that lightning can indeed strike twice with a second win over a Football Bowl Subdivision program in the same season. The Vikings have already beaten Washington State and can show it was no fluke by beating UNT. -- Brett Vito\nWho: Portland State (3-1) at North Texas (0-4)\nWhen: 4 p.m. Saturday\nWhere: Apogee Stadium in Denton\nTV/radio: No TV / KHYI-FM (95.3), KNTU-FM (88.1)\nPortland State at North Texas\nClick here to visit the Mean Green blog\nPrediction: UNT will pull through on homecoming\nFive things UNT fans should know about Portland State\nKindness of UNT community helps grieving player make it to football game\nUNT sticking with McNulty at quarterback\nBest in Texas (10/5): Baylor, TCU in fight for top spot; Houston gains ground on Texas Tech\nBest in Texas breakdown (10/5): Longhorns well behind in-state rivals; SMU remains a mystery\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/", "http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/2015/10/prediction-unt-will-pull-through-on-homecoming.html/", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-105-baylor-tcu-fight-top-spot-houston-gains-ground-texas-tech", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/07/kindness-unt-community-helps-grieving-player-make-football-game", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/2015/10/five-things-unt-fans-should-know-about-portland-state.html/", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-breakdown-105-longhorns-behind-state-rivals-smu-remains-mystery", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/05/unt-sticking-mcnulty-quarterback"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:10:58.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
