FOX Sports \nOct 5, 2015 at 12:34p ET + \nHow would Tristan Thompson look in a Portland Trail Blazers jersey? Craig Mitchelldyer / USA Today   12:34p ET \nThe Cleveland Cavaliers and restricted free agent Tristan Thompson have yet to agree on a new contract, opening a slight possibility that the former fourth overall pick will wear a different uniform next season. \nIt's highly unlikely, but crazier things have happened. And if any team can pry Thompson away from the Cavs , it's the Trail Blazers . Here's a look how, courtesy of SB Nation's Blazer's Edge : Keep in mind, if the Blazers were to successfully pry Thompson away from the reigning Eastern Conference champions, it would come at a high a price. The Cavaliers can still match any offer to Thompson, and would likely match any contract at market value or below, which Cleveland has gauged at 5 years and $80 million. Portland would have to overspend for Thompson, who saw his playing time plummet this last season with the arrival of Kevin Love. There is a lot to be said for Thompson's offensive skill set. He started every game for Cleveland in 2012 and 2013, and subsequently ranked second among all NBA players in offensive rebounds, grabbing an average of 3.5 per contest. Only Andre Drummond grabbed more over that period. He also ranked second in offensive rebound percentage, and cracked the top ten for total rebounds in 2013-2014. Combined with an average of 11.7 points per game, he was a consistent double-double threat. \nJust because the Trail Blazers are far below the cap and can technically offer Thompson a bunch of money doesn't mean they should. Thompson is a nice young player, but his value is inflated coming off an impressive (and unexpected) playoff run. \nHe has numerous flaws, with strengths that are translatable across every team's system. But Portland would still be wise to keep their books as flexible as possible right now. Thompson isn't the answer.
