In April, she was arrested and charged for her alleged role in a Metairie double murder, but after being locked up, Degruy was put on suicide watch.\nBased on statements from mental health experts presented in court Wednesday, Degruy is not competent enough to go to court and face the charge of principal to murder.\nIn April, police say the 18-year-old drove the getaway car after 17-year-old Dexter Allen allegedly shot and killed 56-year-old David Pence and his 26-year-old son Nicholas at their Metairie home on Clifford Drive.\nPolice say they caught up with Degury and Allen days later after the two led authorities on a high speed chase in a stolen vehicle.\nSince the crime, reports have surfaced showing that Degruy has a history with mental health issues. She was found to be mentally unstable when she was 13-years-old.\nAs for Allen, he is in jail awaiting trial for murder and other charges. He has a hearing set for Nov. 17. Degruy will have another mental competency hearing on Jan. 16th to see if she's become stable enough to stand trial for her principal to murder charge.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
