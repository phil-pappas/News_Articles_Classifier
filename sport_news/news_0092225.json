Monday was our first day on the grass with the new manager in charge. It has been very positive. \n\"There is a lot of information and as players we need to listen a lot now, and learn and try to put everything he asks us to do onto the pitch and off the pitch as well. It has been very good, very positive and hopefully it will keep going like that. \n\"He seems to be very passionate - he likes to put in everything that he has and he asks the players for the same. Be very intense, be aggressive with yourself, is what he has been saying. \n\"Always try to be better, always give 10 metres more, because that will be the key to success. That is what he has been saying to us in the last couple of days. \n\"He seems to be a very open manager and someone that likes to be close to the players, but very straight as well. That's what I've learned from the last couple of days and I think it was a positive way to start.\" \nKlopp built up a fine CV at Dortmund, winning two Bundesliga titles and reaching the Champions League final. \nLucas has no doubt the 48-year-old is an inspirational figure and is feeling optimistic about what Liverpool - currently 10th in the Barclays Premier League, six points off the top, ahead of Saturday's trip to Tottenham - can achieve under him. \n\"He was so successful at his last club, Borussia Dortmund,\" Lucas said. \n\"Of course, when a manager like him comes it always gives you a lot of hope. \n\"If we have the same success that Dortmund had when he was there, everyone will be happy. That's why we're really positive about it. \n\"If you look at our position in the table, it's not great. But we are not many points behind the top four and even the top. We still have the cups and the Europa League. \n\"It's still early days in the season and we have a lot to play for. Hopefully, we'll start very well under him and at the end of the season it'll be a successful season for us. \n\"He said to us that he's here because he believes in the team and the club, of course. \n\"We just have to make sure that we get all the information and try to adapt as soon as possible because as soon as we start to put together everything that he says, we have a better chance to succeed.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:05:52.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
