(Photo: Jeff Swinger, The Cincinnati Enquirer) \nEvery week, we go into the film room with former Bengals safety Chris Crocker. He retired in 2013 after 11 seasons in the league and 71 games with the Bengals. He'll dive into the game film to provide his unique insight into what the Bengals are doing right and wrong as the season progresses. \nThis week, Crocker takes a look at the running plays set up for Russell Wilson , and how that alters the way the Bengals must defend Seattle's offense. \nWilson led the NFL in yards per rush last year at 7.2. Colin Kaepernick ranked second at 6.1. That's how much he could change a game with his legs. Often his yards come from scrambles, but the Seahawks designed a scheme to utilize his running skills as well. \n\"He's been a one-man wrecking crew with the offensive line being kind of shattered and not a lot of guys playing well up front he's really been the focal point of the offense,\" Crocker said. \"He's quite impressive. The rest of the offense didn't really do much but if Marshawn Lynch plays he'll be more effective.\" \nZone option run \nGame: Week 2 vs Green Bay \nWhen: First Quarter, 3:56, 2nd &10 \nResult: Marshawn Lynch 7 yards \nWhat: \"This is what I consider their bread and butter. This is what they do. Their No. 1 running play.\" \nPlay 1.1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:56:42.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
