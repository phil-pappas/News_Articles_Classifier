Umpires ruled it a legal play Saturday night. \nTorre says after a thorough review from all angles, he concluded Utley’s slide merited a penalty. \nThere was no immediate word on whether Utley would appeal, which could keep him eligible to play Games 3 and 4 this week in New York. The best-of-five NL Division Series is tied at one apiece. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:57:14.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
