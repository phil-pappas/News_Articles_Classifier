In return, Fremantle gave up its first-round pick (16) as well as pick 35. \n“I’m excited about returning home to WA and joining Fremantle,” Bennell said. \n“I want to thank the Gold Coast for drafting me and the support they have offered me during my time at the club. \n“My main focus now is to knuckle down and have a solid pre-season over the coming months.” \nAn undisputed talent on the field, Bennell struggled with off-field issues in 2015, culminating in an alleged drunken altercation last month that led to the Suns committing to a trade.
