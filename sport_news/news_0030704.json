Enter former Chicago Cubs pitcher Orval Overall , who is from an era so far bygone that he’s sometimes mistakenly referred to as “Orville Overall.” It’s an honest mistake, as Overall’s heyday coincided with the crowning achievements of Orville Wright. Yes, the Chicago Cubs won three consecutive pennants 1906-1908, and back-to-back World Series titles in ought-seven and ought-eight. Ace pitcher Orval Overall was a cornerstone of those Cubs teams. It appears Orville/Orval was a sexy first name to have back in the “oughts.” That’s how you’re supposed to refer to the first decade that was the 1900s, although hardly anyone, other than maybe Mr. Burns, would be likely be able to correct you about this. Also Orvall Overall is sometimes confused with former White Sox pitcher Orval Grove (1940-1949, All-Star appearance in 1944) \n— chris bland (@chrisb972) October 3, 2015 The popularity of Orval Overall made a very brief comeback in 2003 when Kerry Wood accomplished some things that no Cubs pitcher had done since Overall. This year, it’s the current Cubs ace, Jake Arrieta who’s accomplishing that which no Cubs pitcher had done since Overall. Arrieta is the first Cubs pitcher with 200+ strikeouts and 10 or fewer HR allowed since Orval Overall in 1909 (205 K, 1 HR) The national media will soon be banging us over the head with references to 1908. (They’ll bang us over the head with these shopworn cliches too) Hopefully, for the sake of Overall’s descendants and hard core fans (like us), he’ll get a shout-out or two. We’ve also told you what Cubs Playoff Twitter will look like, it will get stale and repetitive. How much better could it be if Orval Overall is trending Wednesday night? (102 years after Overall last pitched a game in the majors) Hey, Old Hoss Radbourn is a hot topic these days. Let’s ride this wave people. While Old Hoss Radbourn won 300+ games in the Major Leagues (career spanned 1880-1891), Orval Overall went 108–71, with an Earned run average of 2.23. He played for the Cincinnati Reds (1905–1906), in addition to the Cubs (1906–1910, 1913). Overall, who led the National League in strikeouts in 1909, died in Fresno in 1947 at the age of 66.
