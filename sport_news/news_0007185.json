His birdie on the 13th hole cut the deficit to one. But he never recovered from a double bogey on the next hole. Gosler ended the match with a 10-foot birdie putt on No. 16. \nIt was Shea's best finish in the match play championship. Upsets ruled the tournament, as Shea and Gosler reached the final as the No. 7 and No. 6 seeds, respectively. \nGosler and Shea both qualified to play on the 2016 CT PGA Challenge Cup team. Adam Rainaud of Black Hall Club in Old Lyme also earned a spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:48:49.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
