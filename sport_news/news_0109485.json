Macomb freshman Maya Stovall took first place overall in the girls race with a winning time of 19 minutes, 28 seconds. \"For the people who finished, compared to where we were three or four weeks ago when we were here, we were a lot quicker â€” boys and girls both,\" said Macomb coach Randy Ames. \"I was really happy. We ran some great races today.\" Macomb senior Isabel Wohlstadter did not run on Tuesday in the girls race and then No. 2 runner Maggie Swanson had to drop out of the race on Tuesday because of asma. In the team standings, Liberty won both the boys and the girls races. M-R senior Dyesha Taylor (21:18) took 11th place overall in the girls race to earn conference honors. Riley Dulin (17:18) led at the 1-mile mark and finished third overall, while Kevin Jurado (18:11) also earned conference honors with an 11th place finish. Rounding out the M-R girls team were: 21-Jordan Copeland (22:34); 23-Arika Hofmann (23:02); 25-Kara Fisher (23:28); 31-Aunna Sheehan (24:25); 35-Grace Murk (25:19); 41-Claudia Garcia (26:51) and 44-Jozie Heikes (28:11). \"They ran really well,\" said M-R coach Sam Marlow. \"This course is tough and it doesn't allow you to go out and get a personal best record, but they held their own with what we had. We ran only four girls and 11 guys.\" About the three runners getting all-conference (Taylor, Dulin and Jurado), Marlow said, \"They are peaking at the right time.\" M-R senior Trevor Blackman (19:18) also finished 20th, while Titan senior Gabe Brown (20:24) finished 34th overall.
