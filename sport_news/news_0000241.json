The controversial star of the Minnesota Vikings is coming to town with the intention of knocking Denver from the ranks of the undefeated. In one breath, Peterson declares he could win three more MVP awards before his NFL career is done. A minute later, the 30-year-old running back insists he could have jumped directly from high school to the pros and been great.\nPeterson said: \"Not to sound cocky or anything ...\"\nIf a football fan doesn't look deeper into Peterson than what fits on the screen of a smartphone, this is how his story reads:\nPeterson beat Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning for the MVP during the 2012 season by rushing for 2,097 yards.\nAnd Peterson was banned for nearly all of last season for allegedly beating his 4-year-old son with a switch.\nOne price of NFL fame is how we reduce men who play football into cartoon heroes and evil villains. So, when Peterson talked Wednesday with Colorado media during a conference call, I asked:\nDoes it bother Peterson that complete strangers, who know him only from what they've seen on television, might conclude he's a great running back but an unsavory person?\n\"Yeah, it does. I'm human. I'm not going to lie to you. It does,\" replied Peterson, hurt he's judged for a mistake that cost him 15 games in 2014 and far more in damage to his reputation. \"At the end of the day, it's not something I can dwell on. When I hear it, I just take that little dagger and pull it and keep going.\"\nAdvertisement After a grand jury indicted Peterson last September on a charge of reckless or negligent injury to a child, the Vikings took away his uniform. After Peterson pleaded no contest in November, he was suspended by the NFL, although that suspension was ultimately overturned, in yet another case of league discipline struck down by a judge.\n\"The first two months, after the situation took place, I was definitely feeling hateful toward a lot of people, because I had a lot of time to sit there and listen. Now, it is what it is. People are going to have to say. Your life is all about how you respond to the situation you're dealing with. That's going to help dictate the outcome.\"\nPeterson is back on the field and running with a vengeance. Through three games, Peterson leads the NFL with 291 rushing yards. His skills have not diminished. But has his love for the game waned?\n\"A little bit,\" Peterson admitted. \"In the sense ...\"\nThen Peterson took a deep sigh, letting the events of the past 12 months wash over him. He felt abandoned by the Vikings, wanted out of Minnesota and, fair or not, was held up as an example of what's wrong with the NFL.\n\"You can kind of lose some of the love, which I felt like I did. I just kind of had to sit back and tell myself: 'Hey, these are the guys (in the Minnesota huddle) who you are really playing for.' ... So you don't cheat your teammates, because you're not as passionate or that love is not the same, due to how things were handled in your particular case. That's something I had to pray about. And I'm in a much better place now,\" Peterson said.\n\"I'm sure there are some Vikings fans out there still that probably don't like me. But that's life. For the most, it's been a warm welcome. Everywhere I go, people have my back and they're not judging me off one situation. Even though you shouldn't judge, they're judging me off what they've seen in me for eight years, the work I've done in my community, the type of person I am around my fans and in general how I treat people.\"\nChild abuse is a social issue far bigger than any game. But I am also in no position to judge Peterson the man.\nAll I do know: If Jim Brown is the greatest running back in NFL history, Peterson has entered the conversation at No. 2. What's more, if there's a superstar who brings more infectious enthusiasm to football than Peterson, I haven't met him.\nYes, Peterson is cocky. But his swagger is served with a playful laugh.\nAsk him if there's a better running back in the league, and Peterson sounds stumped. \"Umm ... umm ... Peyton Manning's got some nice moves,\" he said.\nMention the possibility of being over the hill at age 30, and Peterson makes a cutback in the conversation so sharp it could break ankles.\n\"Do I have another MVP in me? Yeah, of course,\" he said. \"I think that was a trick question.\"\nHere's what I think: If the Broncos shut down Peterson, they will beat Minnesota by at least two touchdowns.\nBut, in a league ruled by quarterbacks, Peterson might be the one running back with such immense talent and a big personality he could come to Denver and, much like Aaron Rodgers or Tom Brady, win a road game by himself.\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or @markkiszla", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:41:27.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
