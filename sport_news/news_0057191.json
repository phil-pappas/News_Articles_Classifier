Scott Cash , 13News Now 3:29 p.m. EDT October 21, 2015 DeVonte Dedmon scores CONNECT TWEET   \nA major part of the William and Mary football success this season has been the balance on offense. Sophomore receiver and kick returner, DeVonte Dedmon is certainly upholding his end of the bargain. While the Tribe can grind it out with the run game they can mix in a solid short passing game. Then along comes Dedmon to make the big plays. \nLast season, Dedmon became the first freshman to start at wide receiver since 1991. \nThis year, he is ranked in the top 20 in the nation in all-purpose yardage. \nDedmon played his high school football at Warhill in Williamsburg. He counts it as a big advantage to have family and friends close by to catch all the action on the football field and to stand by just in case he gets a little homesick.  //on.wvec.com/1RWFPNc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:39:26.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
