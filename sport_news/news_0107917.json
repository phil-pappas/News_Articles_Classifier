Shock — which lists him on its 2016 roster as a 6-foot-3, 270-pound linebacker. \nSaturday’s fight will be his ring debut. \n“Ronnell just has got raw power,” Rouse said. “He’s got the kind of power that picks you up when he hits you. … I think Ronnell is getting everything he needs to be prepared for this. His football career shows that he is a beast. … The fight game was the next progression for him.” \nMarino is coming out of Springfield, Mo., but originally hails from the country of Columbia, Rouse said. \nMarino has blossomed by the skillful cultivation of trainer Ike Stafford, Rouse said, adding that Stafford “is one of the top coaches on the planet.” \nRouse said he was told Marino has slimmed down from 340 pounds to 230 pounds during his time with Stafford. \n“I think Ronnell will have his hands full,” Rouse continued. “Ike said Mario is working hard and wants to be perfect. … I have no doubt this Mario is no joke.” \nCraig Blacklock — who Rouse labeled as “one of the best trainers in the United States” — is preparing Lewis for his fighting endeavors. \n“Craig told me there’s nobody with his kind of power and his kind of punches,” said Rouse. \nRouse finds himself torn between loyalties for the bout. \nHe said he feels Stafford helped open the doors for him to be able to train fighters — and also helped open the doors in Japan for Rouse. \nBut, Rouse also feels closely connected to Blacklock, who he referred to as one of the next generation of top-notch trainers. \n“Somebody’s going to go home disappointed,” he said. “I don’t want to see Ronnell lose. … But, I’m nervous because I’m friends with both camps. On the flip side, the one that wins is going to earn it.” \nThe fight card currently includes eight bouts, but Rouse is trying to firm up a couple of more matchups before he reveals later this week the lineup.
