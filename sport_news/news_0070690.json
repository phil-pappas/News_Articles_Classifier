You can probably think of a bunch of others. But there is one beautiful thing we get more of as we grow older and it's quite a blessing. If you are a kind-hearted, upbeat person the things you gain over time are friendships.\nThere is evidence that people live longer and have a better quality of life when they are surrounded by friends and do things with others, and no one typifies this better than my friend Wally Capps, who celebrated his 75 th birthday last Thursday at White Rock Lake by hosting a 5K fun run, drinks and dinner for all his friends at Winfrey Point.\nWhat a great time we had! We thought we were going to a small party, but when we got there we found a crowd about the size of a typical small fiveK race. Ken Ashby had even marked the course for us. I'm not much of an evening runner so I walked a mile or so, and everyone had a blast.\nMy guess is that Wally's largesse was his way of saying \"no hard feelings\" for beating all of us at just about every race. All I know is, I hope I get invited to his 100 th . Happy birthday Wally.\nYou are what you eat\nWe hear this all the time, but lately I'm seeing more instances of runners whose performance has been affected by mistakes in nutrition or a lack of balance in the diet. Not enough sodium, magnesium, iron, or some other chemical. Not enough protein, too many carbs. Maybe that's happened to you.\nYesterday Jack Fultz, who won the Boston Marathon in 1976, told me about a new app to guide athletes on how best to eat, \"Your Sports Nutrition Coach.\" Developed by Ingrid Skoog, a nutritionist at Oregon State University's College of Public Health and Human Services, the app asks you to enter basic information about height, weight, sex, workout goals and type of training and then tells you what you should be eating, with suggestions on meals. I downloaded it right away and it's superb. Find it here.\nNew kid on the block\nSMU runner Michelle Gaye was unable to make the trip with her team this weekend, so she ran the Dallas Running Club's \"The Loop\" race around White Rock Lake on Saturday. Result: 3 rd place overall, first woman, in a time of 57:45. I watched her fly by me the day before at Andy Brown Park in Coppell in an easy 5-mile run. Let's hope we see her in more local races. Well done Michelle.\nBack on My Feet...\nwill host the Rugged and Raw 10K/20K Trail Run Saturday, October 17 at Cedar Ridge Preserve. It's a tough course as I learned a few years ago. CRP is known for its rugged terrain and steep hills. The race supports a worthy cause, giving those experiencing homelessness a second chance. Race starts at 8 a.m. Learn more at rugged-and-raw.com.\n(Photo caption: The only reason this runner looks comfortable is that this is about the only flat, smooth stretch on the entire Cedar Ridge Preserve Trail. Prepare yourself for an invigorating trail run. / Back on My Feet)\nBriefly...\nDallas Police Officer Jerod Honrath, will finish his 50-State Marathon quest this weekend at Hartford. His average marathon time for the first 49 is 3:08, putting him about 7 th in the country for 50-Staters. The 50-State folks generally run their marathons quite a bit slower than their fastest due to all that volume and travel.\nAnd speaking of 50-State pursuits, Grapevine's Kelly Richards, former LGRAW President and RRCA Director will run her third marathon in 8 days next week when she finishes Newport. She ran New Hampshire and Portland, ME this past weekend.\nSpareribs", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1007489283"], "published": "2015-10-06T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:27:37.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
