The Mets are seeking their first playoff series win since 2006, also the last time they were in the post-season.\nThe winner takes on the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS at home starting Saturday.\nFittingly, the Dodgers’ season could either be prolonged or end on back-to-back appearances by Kershaw and Greinke, whose arms propelled them to a third consecutive NL West title and a franchise-record third straight playoff appearance.\n“They’ve given us two guys that stop streaks, save your bullpen, are just day-in, day-out consistent guys,” manager Don Mattingly said by phone Wednesday when both teams travelled back to Los Angeles. “You can really count on what you’re going to get from them 90-something per cent of the time.”\nWith Greinke and deGrom squaring off again, Kershaw says the series is “dead even.”\n“As good as Zack is and has been the whole year, deGrom has been the same, so there’s really no home-field advantage when you’re facing a guy like deGrom,” he said. “We saw that in Game 1. He’s just very impressive, just very tough to square up. If you can get strike outs on heaters like he can, it’s really tough.”\nGreinke has pitched at least six innings in all 33 of his starts with a 1.66 ERA that led the majors. As one of two right-handers on the Dodgers’ post-season roster, he has allowed two or fewer runs 27 times.\nHe came up big in the only other elimination game of his career, winning Game 5 of the 2013 NLCS against St. Louis, which led the series 3-1. Greinke allowed two runs in seven innings to force a sixth game, which Kershaw started and lost 9-0 to end the season.\n“He’ll paint the corners. He’ll keep the ball down,” said Mets rookie left fielder Michael Conforto, who will start against Greinke. “If he throws that fastball down at the knees we’ll have to make him do that over and over again. But if he elevates, be aggressive with that and hit the ball hard somewhere and just try to keep him in the middle of the plate.”\nBlue Jays break ratings records\nGame 4 of Toronto’s American League Division Series against the Texas Rangers drew an average of 4.38 million viewers, according to Sportsnet.\nThe network says 9.54 million Canadians watched at least some of the game, which kept the Blue Jays alive in the series.\nIt was the most-watched broadcast in Sportsnet history, topping Game 3, which drew an average of 4.17 million viewers.\nJays top one million on Twitter\nToronto’s surge into Major League Baseball’s post-season and performance in the American League Division Series has seen the Blue Jays’ Twitter popularity explode, with the team’s official Twitter account gaining more than 350,000 followers over the course of the season, putting them over one million total followers.\n“We do see these kinds of spikes in sports around a team or athlete when they’re winning,” said Christopher Doyle, director of media partnerships for Twitter Canada. “We see it in the Stanley Cup playoffs. A couple of seasons ago the Montreal Canadiens saw a surge in Twitter followers and almost caught up to the Maple Leafs, at that point, because of their playoff run.\n“A playoff run can really galvanize a fanbase.”\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs remain the most popular Canadian sports franchise on Twitter, but may soon fall to the Blue Jays. The Maple Leafs had 1,034,103 followers and the Blue Jays had 1,030,844 as of Tuesday night — a difference of just 3,259.\nMore on thestar.com\nFive key moments from Blue Jays’ wild ALDS Game 5 win over Rangers\nBlue Jays epic seventh inning: a batter-by-batter breakdown", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:57:32.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
