Gov. Jay Dardenne, U.S. Sen. David Vitter, Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle and Democrat John Bel Edwards - questions about how they would approach restoring Louisiana's badly damaged coast should they become the next Louisiana governor.\nHere are the questions and answers.\nWould you be willing to seek new revenue streams for coastal restoration that include major new taxes capable of generating billions of dollars in new revenue for coastal works?\nAnswers: All the candidates said they would not seek a new tax to fund coastal restoration.\nDo you believe human-induced climate change is occurring and will you advocate that the state consider future climate change in its planning in dealing with its coastal crisis?\nAnswers: Edwards, Dardenne and Angelle each acknowledged the climate is changing. Vitter did not answer that question. Dardenne said humans \"likely play some role\" in causing climate change. Angelle and Edwards said climate change needs to be taken into account in future planning for coastal restoration. Dardenne said current coastal planning is sufficient.\nDo you support river diversions and will you work to not bend to concerns from special interests (for instance fishing groups) that may try to derail diversion construction?\nAnswers: All the candidates said they support river diversions. Angelle and Vitter said a balance between coastal interests and diversions should be struck. Dardenne said he would listen to valid concerns but not veer from the master plan. Edwards said he would be guided by good science.\nDo you intend working with federal agencies (including the Army Corps of Engineers) to most effectively see restoration completed?\nAnswers: All the candidates said yes they would. Angelle said the effectiveness of local governments to get coastal works done should not be underestimated. Vitter said he was opposed to excessive federal bureaucracy.\nDo you favor the Changing Course plans recently released that propose abandoning the current channel of the Mississippi River south of Port Sulphur and bringing ship traffic into the river through a new channel?\nAnswers: None of the candidates unequivocally support the proposal. Dardenne, Edwards and Angelle said any such plan needs to undergo a thorough review. Vitter said it was necessary to have an \"exchange of ambitious ideas.\"\nDo you envision a radically different coastal plan other than the one currently expounded in the 2012 master plan?\nAnswers: All the candidates said they support the current master plan. Vitter, Angelle and Edwards view it as a living document that can be modified. Edwards said he would \"infuse the plan with new science around climate change and subsidence.\"\nDo you support efforts to get the oil industry to retroactively pay for damage it caused in coastal Louisiana?\nAnswers: None of the candidates said they support a lawsuit against the oil industry seeking redress over past damage it caused. The four candidates said they would push for the industry to be involved in coastal restoration. Vitter said he would organize a \"campaign to raise substantial private matching funds from energy and other leading businesses\" to sponsor restoration projects in the state's master plan. Angelle said the industry's involvement in coastal restoration should be resolved \"in a conference room, rather than in the courtroom.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
