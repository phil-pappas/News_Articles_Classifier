David Pocock and Israel Folau were both recalled after passing last-minute fitness tests. \nThe pair, key players for the Wallabies, missed last weekend's heart-stopping quarter-final against Scotland because of injuries but were cleared to return the starting lineup making it through training on Friday. \nThere was one casualty from the Scotland game, however, with loosehead prop Scott Sio failing to recover from an elbow injury. \nSio, instrumental in helping restore confidence to Australia's wonky scrum, was replaced in the starting lineup by James Slipper, who earns his 73rd test cap, a record for an Australian prop. \nAustralia coach Michael Cheika said he expecting a tough match. \n“We’re not surprised at all about their position here,” he said. “So we’ve been preparing accordingly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:11:21.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
