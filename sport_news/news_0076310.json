We all gathered as much information as we could and if it were a real clear picture we never would have went through the process we went through.”\nThe process Addazio referred to was finding a reliable successor after starter Darius Wade suffered a fractured left ankle in the second quarter of a 14-0 loss to Florida State on Sept. 18. BC platooned redshirt freshman Troy Flutie and true freshman Jeff Smith , neither of whom gained separation in consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference losses to Duke (9-7) and Wake Forest (3-0).\nSmith is a read option runner who adds an extra component to Addazio’s power run game, which is missing its featured tailback Jon Hilliman (foot).\nSmith looks to be the morning line favorite to play four quarters against the Tigers because his skill set better fits Addazio’s schemes.\nFlutie is the better thrower, but neither demonstrated the capacity to conduct a sustained passing game against lesser defenses than Clemson.\nAnother challenge\nBC’s defense will encounter its toughest test of the season when the Eagles (3-3, 0-3) take on No. 5 Clemson (5-0, 2-0).\nTigers quarterback Deshaun Watson is second in the ACC in passing efficiency (153.8) and has thrown for 11 touchdowns. He’s also run for 202 yards. Under Watson’s direction, the Tigers have averaged 35.4 points and 431.8 yards per game.\n“He has a great arm, can run the ball too and they have a lot of offensive weapons so we have to be prepared for anything,” said BC defensive tackle Truman Gutapfel .\n“We just have to go down there and keep playing the way we have been playing and prepare like we’ve been preparing.”\nIt’s all on ‘D’\nBC still leads the nation in yards allowed per game (140.3), rushing yards (41.7), passing yards (98.7) and fewest first downs allowed (56). The Eagles are second in the nation in points allowed per game and are second in the ACC with 16 sacks.\nThose numbers will be strained against Clemson’s offense in Death Valley, but Gutapfel insists there will be no easy yards.\n“There is a great sense of pride because we have been working for this stuff all year,” said Gutapfel. “It is honestly our mindset.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:26:01.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
