Dooner added 155 yards and a score on 10 carries. Together, they posted 404 yards of total offense. Guerriero was 10-of-12 for 49 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. \n\"That was one of the single best performances I’ve ever seen at this level,\" Glen Rock coach Jim Kurz said. \"[But] we had faith in our quarterback too.\" \nAfter trading scores through 2 1/2 quarters, Glen Rock recovered a fumble on the Golden Bears’ 29-yard-line and turned it into a score six plays later. Schlett faked a handoff to Dooner. Dooner went left, and Schlett cut to his right and went up the middle with the ball to put the Panthers on top for good, 28-21, with 4:29 remaining in the third quarter. \nSchlett said the Panthers have struggled to create big plays like the fumble recovery. \n\"We were talking about defense. Coach said, ‘We need a big play, we haven’t had a big play yet and a big play is going to turn this thing around,’ \" Schlett said. \"They came out [of halftime], scored. … We are a bit low, then [the fumble recovery] brought us up, so that was big for momentum.\" \nThe big plays continued as the Panther defense had two interceptions, and the offense added some breathing room before the Golden Bears rallied late. \nA 53-yard run by Dooner and a 19-yard pass from Schlett to Tommy Pulzello highlighted a five-play drive after Tim Ray picked off Guerriero. Schlett ran in the 7-yard score to make it 35-21 with 10:27 to go. \nHowever, the Golden Bears had Guerriero to make big plays for them. The senior matched Schlett’s three second-half touch downs, all on runs of at least 50 yards. Guerriero had a 53-yard score and then an 83-yard touchdown run to make it 42-35 with 47.5 seconds remaining. \nLyndhurst recovered an onside kick, but Pulzello picked off Guerriero to end the game.
