McCown then used more than seven minutes to move the Browns 51 yards before Coons kicked his fourth field goal of the game with 6:43 left in OT. \nMcCown completed 36 of 51 passes with two touchdowns in becoming the first quarterback in Browns history with three straight 300-yard games. He broke the team record of 444 yards passing set by Brian Sipe on Oct. 25, 1981, against the Baltimore Colts. \nJoe Flacco ran for two 1-yard touchdowns and threw for a score but fell to 13-2 against Cleveland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:27:12.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
