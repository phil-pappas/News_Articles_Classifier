(AP) -- Sebastien Le Toux converted a penalty kick in the 41st minute and Andre Blake earned the shutout in the Philadelphia Union's 1-0 victory on Sunday that knocked Orlando City out of MLS Cup playoff contention. \nOrlando City had faint playoff hopes going into the season finale, needing a victory and a New England Revolution loss while making up an eight-goal differential. New England beat NYC FC 3-1. \nWith Le Toux improving to 13 for 13 on penalty kicks, the Union (10-17-7) snapped a two-game losing streak, but missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. \nCristian Higuita collected a pair of second-half yellow cards and was ejected in the 86th minute. \nThe teams were booked for 10 cards in the game, seven by Orlando City. \nBlake, the first pick in the 2014 SuperDraft, needed five saves to collect the shutout. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:32:29.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
