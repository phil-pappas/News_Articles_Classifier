Russell Wilson and the Seahawks are ruling this one-sided rivalry with San Francisco. \nThe 49ers produced another prime-time dud, on Thursday night against the Seahawks just like last year for Thanksgiving when Richard Sherman chomped turkey on the Levi’s Stadium field. \nKaepernick completed 13 of 24 passes of 124 yards while taking six sacks in the 20-3 loss Thursday, San Francisco’s fourth straight defeat to its NFC West rival and sixth in the last seven meetings. \n“We’ve had our struggles with Seattle,” said 49ers tight end Vernon Davis, who had his first catches since Week 2. “It’s pretty hard to get by this.” \nKaepernick’s errant passes sailed into both sidelines, one ball even hitting a 49ers staff member in the head early in the game and requiring him to be checked. The 49ers had more punts - nine - than first downs (eight). \n“I’m not going to force a ball into a window and take a chance on a turnover,” said Kaepernick, his right hand taped after the game because of a swollen thumb. “We just didn’t make plays when we needed to. I do know we didn’t play well enough to win.” \nPhil Dawson kicked a 35-yard field goal late in the third, and the 49ers have been held to single digits in their past three losses to Seattle with just one touchdown, outscored 56-13. \nSan Francisco’s 55 yards in the first half were the fewest allowed by the Seahawks defense in an opening half since Week 17 of the 2013 season against St. Louis. The 49ers (2-5) finished with 142, fewer than the 164 they managed on Thanksgiving and their worst total since 133 yards against the Vikings on Nov. 5, 2006. \nIt was Seattle’s second-lowest total allowed under coach Pete Carroll. \n“Offensively today it was just not acceptable all the way around,” 49ers left tackle Joe Staley said. \nKaepernick fell to 1-6 in seven starts against the Seahawks with three touchdown passes to nine interceptions and 24 sacks and San Francisco flopped four days after ending a four-game losing streak by beating Baltimore. \nFans left early again in an eerily similar scene to Thanksgiving night, when 49ers CEO Jed York apologized on Twitter in the waning moments by saying: “This performance wasn’t acceptable. I apologize for that.” \nThis time, it was former 49ers wideout Kassim Osgood weighing in on Twitter with: “‘Something ain’t right in SF.” \nThis game lacked its usual intrigue with both teams trying to save their seasons and Carroll missing former nemesis and now-Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. \n“That game today was not what we want. It was not acceptable,” first-year coach Jim Tomsula said. “We did not play well. We don’t have an excuse. Again, that lies right here and we need to do a better job.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:38:26.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
