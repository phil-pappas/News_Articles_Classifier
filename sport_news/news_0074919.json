To make matters worse, it has given up 51 points off turnovers. Opponents have converted 100 percent of the time inside the Red Zone, a perfect 22-of-22. Of those 22 chances, 15 of the drives have resulted in touchdowns.\nUMass ranks a woeful No. 119 among 127 teams in NCAA FBS statistics for total team defense. Saturday’s opponent, Kent State (2-4, 1-1 MAC) comes in ranked tied for No. 16 (with Florida), allowing 296.3 yards-per-game.\n“Obviously, last week stung quite a bit. We thought we were on the right track,’’ said defensive coordinator/defensive backs coach Tom Masella. “We didn’t play well. We made them look good. We told the guys that if we don’t play well against a good team then that will happen. We haven’t responded on the road. We have to stay strong and keep working.\n“We seem to be playing well every other week. Our message has been if we play hard and stay together good things will happen. As far as Ken State, I just think we have to worry about ourselves. It’s more about us than them right now. I’m sure they want to get untracked, too,’’ said Masella.\nLast week, UMass was hammered, 62-38, on the road by Bowling Green, a defeat that beat up the Minutemen more mentally than physically.\n“Well, there were a lot of kickoffs and kick returns so I don’t think we need to work on them,’’ said UMass head coach Mark Whipple. “(Bowling Green quarterback) Matt Johnson had a good day. I thought our red zone would be better but they were just better than us. Our road worries crept up again and it was like we were back at Notre Dame, back at Colorado. We just didn’t make a play.’’\nSenior Trey Dudley-Giles agreed the team has to improve in a hurry.\n“We’re looking for a win. We talked about doing the little things and just trying to get better every week,’’ said Dudley-Giles, who has 33 tackles (20 solo), with an interception and 4 pass break-ups. “It’s more about communication and trusting in the game plan. We have to work through it in order to get a little more confidence. We have to try and get the younger guys more involved, too. ‘’\nDespite the seeming defensive differential, Kent State may just the right opponent and at the right time for the beleaguered Minutemen to confront . Last year, UMass belted the Golden Flashes, 40-17 as quarterback Blake Frohnapfel threw for three touchdowns. The 40 points against Kent continued a streak of three straight games with 40 or more points, a feat only accomplished twice previously by UMasss (1963, 1972). Keep an eye on career-leader Tajae Sharpe (224 receptions), who needs 3 more receiving yards to tie Adrian Zullo (2,892 from 1998-2002) for No. 1 all-time in receiving yards.\n“They have a big tailback who is about 6-foot-1 and 250 pounds so I think it’s going to be a big tackling game,’’ said Dudley-Giles. “But, I think a big factor for us is being back home. We have to protect McGuirk Stadium and we have to protect UMass. A win would be a huge confidence boost. We can still get on a roll but we have to start doing the little things better.’’\nUMass now gets to play its next two games at home, at McGuirk Stadium today and next week (Oct. 24) against Toledo at Gillette Stadium.\n“I think their guys play really hard. Their two corners are the best I’ve seen since Notre Dame. Their guys give you issues on their schemes. We just have to match their physicality,’’ said Whipple about Kent State. “I think it will be a different game this week. I hope.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:52:32.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
