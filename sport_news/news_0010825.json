He nonetheless possesses one attribute I’ll never understand: He’s a Cubs fan.\nHe cheered himself raw through the division series , and is trying desperately to score tickets to the championship series (starting bid: $450 a seat at Wrigley Field).\nKevin doesn’t want to believe, but there it is, promise, rumbling down Addison Street. Could the Cubs, those Legendary Losers, finally do it?\nMutual friends wonder what will happen if, as is likely, fate reverts to its true course. Some unfortunate Bartman runs afoul, Jon Lester breaks his arm in a freak accident, perhaps the Earth rips asunder and swallows Wrigley in an effort to right the universe. The last bit of hope will be crushed from Kevin’s soul; we’ll find him years from now, surrounded by yellowed newspapers, muttering to himself, having not left his apartment in decades.\nBut I worry what happens if they win.\nCub fans have spent a century stitching themselves a coat of fatalism. It’s not just that they expect to lose, I think, deep down, they want to lose. Otherwise, why keep coming back, year after year, an army of Masochistic Millions.\nGames at Wrigley are more about ritual than result. The brick, the “a-one, a-two, take me out to the ballgame” impersonations of Harry Caray. That it’s already a meaningless game in July? Ah, well, let’s have another beer.\nRemember, this is a team that last won the World Series in 1908. Which last won the pennant when Truman was in office. Which made the playoffs in 2008, sure, but were swept in the first round. Yet every year, they’re near the top in attendance. Who are these people?\nKevin, at least, was born into fandom, but that only proves that a good hunk of the Midwest should be brought up on charges of child abuse.\nLet’s face it, Cubs fans love the mystique. It ain’t called the “Second City” for nothing, an inferiority complex masquerading as a metropolis. Poor, pitiable us. We’re the lovable underdogs. My father cheered for them, and his father, and his father. And did any of them see a championship? Hell no! Disappointment unites the generations.\nJust wait ’til next year!\nIf the Cubs win, they stop being a symbol and become just another team. I don’t think Kevin, or the city, could handle it.\nA nation wants the Mets to lose.\nBut if they win, I think Chicago will be a lot better off.\nStephen Lynch is The Post’s Sunday Editor \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  crazed fans ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:19:05.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
