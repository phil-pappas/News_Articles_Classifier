And considering what he has accomplished, and how his moves and machinations enabled the Blue Jays to win the American League East and the AL Division Series, how attendance and television ratings have been astonishing, it’s somewhat startling that club ownership has left Anthopoulos dangling this long. \nFor the record, no one in a position of authority will talk about the Anthopoulos situation. When reached in Cleveland, Shapiro politely declined, saying he won’t be doing any commenting on Jays issues until he officially replaces Beeston on Nov. 1. And through a corporate spokesperson, newly hired Rogers Media president Rick Brace, declined to be interviewed. \nWhen reached at Kauffman Stadium Friday night before Game 6, Anthopoulos refused to address the matter at all. On the road late in the season he did say he hoped to be back as GM and wants to be back. \nBut one source said Friday that he didn’t “foresee any circumstance that would result in Alex leaving. I believe this will get done.” \nAnother source did reference one possible problem: “What if it’s like David Dombrowski and Ben Cherington in Boston. When Dombrowski took over as president, Cherington declined to stay on as GM.” \nMeanwhile, Anthopoulos will continue on for the next week, whether the Jays are playing or not, as though the job is his going forward, taking care of baseball matters just like it’s another day at the office. “He’s earned the right to do the job,” said a source. \nIt is expected Anthopoulos will meet with Shapiro in early November and a deal finalized, unless the two can’t get on the same page.
