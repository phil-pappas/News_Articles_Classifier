I get it. I’m with you,’ ” one Nationals veteran told the paper.\n“The next time you’re like, ‘Ooookay. All right. I’m trying to get it. Yeah.’ And then when it keeps happening, guys are watching him like, ‘Well, here comes this guy again.’ ”\nJonathan Papelbon choking Bryce Harper last week Photo: MLB.com The report states the anger at Williams — who is expected to be replaced following the season — dates back to his suspect use of the bullpen when the heavily-favored Nationals fell to the eventual champion Giants in last year’s NLDS.\nAfter last season’s disappointment, the Nationals were still considered the co-favorites with the Dodgers in the National League after signing Max Scherzer to a seven-year, $210 million deal.\nBut some in the clubhouse were frustrated with the money the Nationals were giving Scherzer when other moves seemed to be motivated by saving cash. That included dealing setup man Tyler Clippard to the Athletics in the offseason, a move that was emphasized when the reliever ended up on the Mets just as they were blowing by Washington in the NL East.\nBut most of the discouragement was aimed at Williams and how he handled his players.\nJayson Werth was one of many Nationals frustrated by Williams. Photo: AP “He’s like the guy in his house who hears a sound, like someone breaking in,” one player told the paper in the final section of a three-part series on the team’s disastrous season. “And his reaction isn’t to take care of the problem or investigate. It’s to put his head under the pillow and hope it goes away.”\nThat attitude ultimately led to a furious Jayson Werth confronting Williams after being left out of the lineup in late August.\n“When exactly do you think you lost this team?” Werth screamed at Williams, those who witnessed the incident told the paper.\nWhen may be a question, but there is no doubt over whether he lost the team or not. The Papelbon-Harper incident put that on display for those outside the team, and now – barring a miracle – it will cost Williams his job.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bryce harper ,  jayson werth ,  jonathan papelbon ,  matt williams ,  tyler clippard ,  washington nationals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:44:23.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
