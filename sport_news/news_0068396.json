Their defense answered the call, holding a limited Cowboys offense to 1-of-8 on third down in the first half.\nThe defense took away Dallas’ only two pass-catching weapons as well as the outside run, leaving the Cowboys to try and win the line of scrimmage (they didn’t) and beat the Pats with guys like receiver Terrance Williams and backup quarterback Brandon Weeden, who is 5-19 as a starter for a reason. He stinks.\nThe Patriots made him even more odorous than usual, buying the offense time to sort things out. Eventually it did, scoring three of the four times it had the ball in the second half to turn this into an “On to Indianapolis” rout.\nQUARTERBACK\nB+\nIt took Tom Brady time to adjust to the fierce Dallas pass rush and an unexpected 3-2 alignment, but when he did, he tore it to shreds by getting rid of the ball quickly and moving just enough to avoid the rush. He was 10-for-11 in the second half for 165 yards, two touchdowns and zero sacks after being dropped five times in the first two quarters. He couldn’t find his binky, tight end Rob Gronkowski, most of the day to the credit of rookie defensive back Byron Jones, but they did hook up twice for 51 yards early in the second half. Brady did fumble once, was knocked around enough that several times he seemed to move or flee when he didn’t really have to, and unloaded what could have been a pick-six when he never saw cornerback Corey White jump a short route late in the game. Bad read. Brady was holding the ball longer than usual early, but once the new alignment was solved, he was same old guy. His QB sneak for a touchdown was followed by an emphatic spike. Hello, Greg Hardy.\nRUNNING BACK\nB+\nDion Lewis continues to impress. He averaged 5.7 yards per carry and caught 8-of-11 balls thrown his way, piling up 93 total yards and a touchdown. His ability to make the first tackler miss repeatedly resulted in extra yards, the best example his 10-yard TD catch in the flat. He made a one-handed catch of a poorly thrown ball then eluded safety Barry Church and defensive tackle Jack Crawford before simply running through the poor tackling effort of safety J.J. Wilcox for the score. His vision is superior as is his dexterity and ability to keep himself balanced on cuts. LeGarrette Blount continues to be an effective second-half bludgeon when trying to maintain a lead.\nWIDE RECEIVER\nB-\nIt was an up-and-down day for Julian Edelman. At first glance, four catches for 120 yards is impressive, but he committed three penalties that cost 49 yards, so his net was 71. Figure in a 59-yard catch on which Danny Amendola’s pick left him wide-open and he did less than it appeared. He did make a nice run after that catch, getting away with a nifty push-off on cornerback Morris Claiborne and then completely faking him out. Keshawn Martin made a great diving catch on third-and-2 in the fourth quarter but was flagged for an obvious illegal pick early in the game. You can’t play in this offense if you keep getting caught. Poor Amendola finished with two catches for 6 yards because Edelman cost him a 34-yard reception. Few noticed his work freeing Edelman on the long TD, but he made the play happen.\nTIGHT END\nC-\nDallas did a good job taking Rob Gronkowski away with Byron Jones’ tight coverage and by playing him far more physically at the line than the Pats’ first three opponents. Gronkowski also didn’t block as effectively as in previous games, once failing to get any push on a third-and-1 when LeGarrette Blount was stuffed. Gronk made his mark to open the second half when he hauled in a back-shoulder pass in tight coverage then thrust Jones aside and rumbled for a 33-yard gain. On same drive, he beat Jones’ one-on-one coverage for 18 more yards. You simply can’t give Gronkowski that much space. Later he ran a slant needing 11 yards but only got 10. When’s the last time that happened? Michael Williams was used more than usual because Dallas’ rush was heavy. That made Scott Chandler’s appearance a cameo.\nOFFENSIVE LINE\nB-\nIt’s not a good day when you give up five first-half sacks and unofficially allow the quarterback to be hit a dozen times. Early on, the line had trouble adjusting to Dallas’ 3-2 front with linebackers Rolando McClain and Sean Lee often lined up inside and defensive end Greg Hardy repeatedly beating left tackle Nate Solder (two sacks, five hits allowed). Right tackle Sebastian Vollmer also was below par in his protection, allowing Lee an early pressure and later a sack on a bull-rush by Jack Crawford on third down. Marcus Cannon came in when Solder left with an elbow injury and fared better, in part because Tom Brady was getting rid of the ball quickly. But he also was beaten by Hardy as well to the outside, and the result was a Brady fumble that was recovered by Julian Edelman. Rookie center David Andrews had some struggles as well, allowing a McClain sack on the opening drive when he didn’t react in time to pick up the blitz. Rookie guard Shaq Mason was beaten to the inside by tackle Tyrone Crawford for a sack. Things weren’t great, but they were better in the second half against a tiring defense.\nDEFENSIVE LINE\nA-\nKnowing Dallas’ habit was to run on first down, the Pats stacked the line and stuffed it, leaving quarterback Brandon Weeden in situations not suited to his limited skills. Jabaal Sheard had another solid game with two sacks and three hits on Weeden. He also held tight end Jason Witten too long at the line on one play, negating a sack. He knew better. On one of his sacks, Sheard overwhelmed guard Ronald Leary, creating a third-and-18 that helped the Pats get the ball back and hit a long field goal. He also made a nice tackle on tailback Joseph Randle. Nice play, but a bit less chest-pounding next time would be nice. Rob Ninkovich was strong on the edge and made one controlled rush on Weeden, refusing to over-pursue and patiently forcing an incompletion. Smart play. Alan Branch and the rest of the inside tackle rotation were not dominating but didn’t have to be because Dallas’ backs refused to run inside. End Chandler Jones will have a hard time living down his drop of an easy interception after slipping unseen into coverage. He showed why he’s not playing offense.\nLINEBACKER\nA\nJamie Collins again was dominant with 10 tackles and a forced fumble. He’s a playmaker and a disturbing presence. He had a sack, but it was negated by Jabaal Sheard’s holding penalty. Collins pushed through two blockers on that play. He made several solid one-on-one tackles and was sound in coverage, closing fast and forcing a Jason Witten fumble in the fourth quarter. Jonathan Freeney recovered that fumble and saw more action than usual after Dont’a Hightower went out with a rib injury. He and Jerod Mayo replaced Hightower, whose absence was felt. Mayo was slow in coverage on several throws, including a 10-yard completion to Joseph Randle in the flat. Hightower was on his way to a solid game with an early sack on a bull-rush, keeping his feet after running back Darren McFadden’s cut block. If he is long absent, it will be costly, although the addition of Jon Bostic could help relieve some of the stress assuming he grasps the defense.\nDEFENSIVE BACK\nA-\nThis was a bit like a take-home exam with Tony Romo and Dez Bryant both out. Brandon Weeden is no Romo, and none of Dallas’ receivers was even close to Dez Light. Cornerback Malcolm Butler drew one-on-one coverage of Terrance Williams and negated him, with the exception of one route on which he lost his footing. Safety Devin McCourty (eight tackles) did a good job playing closer to the line than usual and as part of repeated double coverage on Jason Witten. He made an exemplary play on Witten near the goal line on third-and-4, getting outside with him but waiting patiently and not over-committing, simply tackling him well short of the sticks. Safety Patrick Chung made seven tackles close to the line to help on first-down runs, and cornerback Tarell Brown also had seven, including a nice open-field play on a third-down screen to Darren McFadden. As a group, the secondary took away Witten and Cole Beasley with double coverage and left Butler to deal with Williams, which he did well. Corner Logan Ryan had an easy interception late when Weeden heaved a pass into double coverage that came up short.\nSPECIAL TEAMS\nA+\nIt was a big day for the kicking game. Stephen Gostkowski hit on three field goals, two from long distance (49, 57), and six of his seven kickoffs were touchbacks. The other one should have been, as the return resulted in poor field position. Punter Ryan Allen netted 42.3 yards with three of his four kicks landing inside the 20. Couple that with great coverage and you had the Cowboys’ offensive drives starting, on average, at their 18 yard line. With a depleted offense, that was a huge advantage for New England’s defense.\nCOACHING\nA-\nThe coaches were ill-prepared for the Cowboys’ use of a new 3-2 defensive front with dime coverage, but they made sound adjustments that gave extra help on Greg Hardy and shored up the middle. Defensively, the plan was to take Jason Witten and Cole Beasley away, knowing Dallas had no deep speed over the top. That allowed safety Devin McCourty to play closer to the line and often as part of a two- and even three-man coverage against Witten in zone. Witten could find no open areas in the middle of the field, which is where he does is damage. Matt Patricia also realized Dallas almost always runs on first down and that the backs try to take every run wide, having little interest in working between the tackles. His defense took those stretch runs away and shored up the edges. The Pats lost the pregame prep battle but dominated the in-game coaching.\nHEAD OF THE CLASS\nStephen Gostkowski\nCan’t kick about this kicker’s performance.\nJabaal Sheard\nThree tackles, two sacks makes good use of your time.\nDion Lewis\nLittle Big Man is growing on us all.\nBACK OF THE PACK\nJulian Edelman\nThree penalties suggests John Harbaugh’s not the only guy who needs to read the rule book.\nNate Solder\nHe was having a bad day even before he got a bad elbow.\nChandler Jones\nShowed why he plays defense when he dropped an easy interception.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:51:24.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
