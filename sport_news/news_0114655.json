Elise Zwicklbauer's goal lifts Burnt Hills field hockey to win 1  /  5 Back to Gallery Schuylerville \nLexie Ball has never been afraid to be physical, and that often means getting blasted with the hard rubber ball.\nBall, one of the nation's premier lacrosse goalies, sacrificed her body for the Burnt Hills field hockey team as a midfielder Wednesday night by stopping a clearing attempt. That play presented teammate Elise Zwicklbauer with the following scenario: 20 yards of real estate, five defenders and a goalie to negotiate. \nNo problem.\nZwicklbauer used slick stick-handling and speed to create space and the senior star then rifled a shot past Saratoga goalie Liz McIntyre with 55.6 seconds remaining as the Spartans registered a stirring 1-0 Suburban Council victory at Schuylerville High School .\n\"It is those finishing goals that we need,\" Burnt Hills coach Kelly Vrooman said.\nA five-year varsity player, Zwicklbauer continues to add memorable chapters to a spectacular senior season.\n\"She has really been coming through. What a fantastic player,\" Ball said of Zwicklbauer. \"She's going to Richmond next year and she's going to do great things there. I am really happy for her and happy for this team to get this win.\"\nBurnt Hills (12-1, 11-0) controlled the action throughout the second half, yet could not put one in. Ball's play set the stage for Zwicklbauer, who scored her 18th goal of the season.\n\"I had to get it to Elise. I knew she was going to finish it,\" Ball said.\n\"What a great setup,\" Zwicklbauer said. \"I was determined ... determined for my team. They worked so hard. Lexie put her body on the line to make that stop. For her, my teammates and the coaches, I didn't want to go into overtime.\"\nBurnt Hills, winner of three straight Section II Class B titles, is now three wins away from a perfect Suburban Council campaign. The Spartans play host to Bethlehem on Saturday for Senior Night, then take on Shenendehowa on Wednesday and Niskayuna at Union College Oct. 16.\n\"That would be a first. Every season, we've had a first. That would be another one,\" Vrooman said.\nVrooman, in her sixth season coaching the team, believes she has a squad capable of finishing off a perfect Suburban Council slate. Beating Saratoga for the second time is a huge step in that regard.\n\"We had possession. That is something we haven't really done against the Class AA powers,\" Zwicklbauer said. \"We have stolen some games and played up with them, but we have not really dominated like that. I am really proud of that.\"\n\"We haven't won twice against them in one season. This whole season has been about dreams of firsts,\" Ball said. \"It is so exciting being No. 1 in the Suburban Council. It has never really been a real goal, but now that we have it, we're not about to give it up.\"\nBurnt Hills was part of a thrilling four-team Suburban Council title chase in 2014 along with Shenendehowa, Saratoga and Columbia. Shenendehowa won the league and Saratoga went on to capture the Class A title.\nThe Spartans already own a 2-1 win against Shenendehowa and previously defeated Saratoga (9-3, 7-3), 3-2. \n\"The difference between this year's team and last year's team is we're more offensive,\" Ball said. Last year, we played defense and protected.\"\nThe Spartans still know how to protect their goal. Senior goalie Brittany Ryan made a couple of critical saves to deny Saratoga standout Maggie Conway — one when she came out of the goal to sweep aside a cross and the other on a kick save on a Conway shot through traffic.\njallen@timesunion.com • 518-454-5062 • @TUSidelines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:31:30.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
