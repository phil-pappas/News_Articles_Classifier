He rallied from 18th position, cutting through traffic with the drafting assistance of Kenny Wallace, to win for the final time.\nEarnhardt Jr., then in his first full season of Sprint Cup racing, was among the drivers his father passed. He remembers the race as one he possibly could have won, but, looking back, the result was for the best, he said.\nEarnhardt Jr., then driving for his father's team, remembers the closing laps in considerable detail.\n\"I was sitting behind Mike Skinner (Earnhardt Sr.'s teammate), and we were in a single-file line on the inside and Mike was protecting the bottom,\" he said. \"I was going to sit there until the last lap and try to pass him. And Dad's [drafting] line formed on the outside and was coming.\n\"I could see him in the mirror knocking off a few guys each corner and getting closer toward the lead. I had to decide whether I was going to try to pass Mike now and then maybe battle my dad for the lead.\n\"I knew that pushing Mike Skinner past Daddy was not going to work well. I think I was riding home with Daddy, anyway. I didn't have a plane then. I knew he wouldn't have wanted that.\n\"Part of me is pulling for him. The other part of me is thinking I'm not in the situation I want to be in because I thought I was just going to have to try to pass Mike. I started lifting, and then our line really started falling.\n\"It worked out for him (Earnhardt Sr.), and that was good. It was a hell of a comeback. It's just great to hear that story. I hate to think about how it went for me because I wanted to win the race.\"\nEarnhardt Jr. finished 14th that day. He would get his first victory at Talladega the following season.\nNow, he needs a seventh at NASCAR's biggest track.\nThe drama will be very real Sunday, and Earnhardt Jr. said he's fine with the stark finality that's involved in seeing four more drivers booted from the championship race.\n\"There's no denying the intensity and the pressure it puts on drivers like myself to be in a cutoff situation where you're eliminated if things don't go perfectly on Sunday,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"But I think it's what the fans enjoy. If I'm a fan, I like it.\n\"I know I've read quite a few comments about this [Chase] system and whether it's fair and so forth. And I think I've read a lot of great opinions about that. But, it's definitely, as a fan, really what we needed.\"\nEarnhardt Jr. said the rest of the Chase will be an attractive adventure even if he isn't a championship contender.\n\"I think it's really going to be exciting,\" he said. \"It was great last year even when we weren't a part of it. It was amazing to watch. I really like to see the sport as healthy as possible, and what we saw last year was great for that.\n\"So who knows what's left? I'm excited to see it, and hopefully I'm a part of it.\"\nFollow Hembree on Twitter @mikehembree\nDale Earnhardt Jr. through the years Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/mikehembree", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:36:19.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
