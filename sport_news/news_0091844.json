(Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) \nMIAMI – For 12 minutes Wednesday night, the Washington Wizards ’ revamped offense exhibited its potential. The Wizards shared the basketball. They constantly pushed the ball and spaced the floor. They made open shots and attacked the basket. \nBy the end of the 12 minutes, they had tallied 29 first-quarter points and held a 12-point lead over the Miami Heat after building a 16-point advantage. They assisted on seven of their eight baskets. They made 3 of 5 three-pointers. They generated nine free throw attempts. And they inflicted most of the damage opposite one of the NBA’s best starting lineups. \nIt was perhaps the best Washington’s offense has looked through six preseason games given the caliber of opponent. The problem was they couldn’t consistently sustain the effort when the second unit was on the floor in their 110-105 loss . \n“Our first unit was really efficient,” Coach Randy Wittman said. “It’s still a work in progress. I thought in the second quarter we lost our pace a little bit and allowed them to get into a rhythm. You want this pace thing to be a thing for 48 minutes. We walked the ball up a couple times on their missed but for the most part I was pretty satisfied, especially with our first unit tonight.” \nThe Wizards didn’t have Bradley Beal, who sat to rest, but their starting quintet still outscored Miami’s 75-43 and pounced on the Heat again the third quarter, reopening a 13-point gap. Wittman then pulled most of his starters by the end of the period while the Heat had three on the floor to finish the contest, and the Wizards went on to lose the lead. \nWhen the first unit was on the floor everything seemed to click. All five players reached double figures. Marcin Gortat headed the charge with 18 points and 13 rebounds, while supplying standout rim protection by blocking four shots and altering others. Kris Humphries added 16 points, including a couple three-pointers, and 12 rebounds. John Wall, back from a one-game absence, recorded 14 points, seven assists, and a dangerous leap over the first row near the Heat bench in the first quarter in an attempt to save a loose ball. \n“You never know when it will be your last game so it might be your last game so I just try to give it everything I’ve got,” Wall said. “I thought I saved it but I cleared them. That just shows my long-jump skills.” \nWhen Washington pushed the pace, it was relentless, on Heat makes and misses. One sequence particularly stood out to Wizards guard Garrett Temple: When the Heat’s Tyler Johnson flushed a dunk in the third quarter, Ramon Sessions, the Wizards’ backup point guard, needed just five seconds to make a layup and earn a trip to the free throw line for a three-point play. \nWall said he is growing accustomed to not asking for the ball every time an opponent misses, as he did in previous seasons. He is now comfortable running the floor on the wing and allowing Otto Porter Jr. or Beal or Gary Neal or another capable ball-handler to push the ball, which gives him to attack defenses that aren’t set. \nBut Wittman and players emphasized there is still room to grow and improvements could be made in their preseason finale Friday against the Toronto Raptors in Montreal. So just how much can the Wizards’ offense, nearing the end of its dress rehearsals, improve? \n“Oh a lot, man. It’s not even close,” Wall said. “I think we can get better. You saw with the first unit we were moving the ball, getting good shots and then it kind of died down and we tried to get back in and get back into a rhythm and just get into a flow. We missed some easy shots but we also missed some layups and some free throws. If we play the way we started and get everybody to play that way for 48 minutes, we’ll be good.” \nBlair expects to play Friday: DeJuan Blair was held out Wednesday because of a minor knee injury but he said he expects to play in the exhibition finale against the Raptors. Blair explained he re-injured the knee that forced him to miss action earlier in the preseason but is confident it won’t plague him. \nUp next: The Wizards will fly to Montreal on Thursday to play the Raptors there Friday. It will be the first time the two teams will face each other since Washington swept Toronto out of the first round of the playoffs last spring.
