It hasn’t been easy, but we kept trying because we can’t wait to bring our first child into the world and grow our family.” \nWATCH: Chrissy Teigen Discusses Fertility Struggles With Emotional Tyra Banks: ‘Stop Asking Me!’ \n“We’re so excited that it’s finally happening,” Teigen continued. “Thank you for all your love and well wishes. I look forward to all the belly touching! Xx.” \nThe model has been candid about the coupleâs fertility struggles recently, opening up about the media pressure on her FABLife talk show in September. \n“Every single time I sit down for an interview with anybody….I will say, just being two years into being married, the questions just come from all over,” Teigen said. “Itâs kind of crazy because I canât imagine being that nosy to be like, âSo, when are the kids coming?â because who knows what somebodyâs going through.” \nWATCH: Chrissy Teigen Says Fights With John Legend Are Lame: ‘Nothing Really Triggers Him’ \nThe Lip Sync Battle co-host revealed that she and Legend have been trying to conceive over the last few years, and have seen fertility doctors. \n“John and I were having trouble. We would have had kids five, six years ago if it had happened,” Teigen said. “But my gosh, itâs been a process.” \nWhile the model is no stranger to TMI moments, she told ET that Legend was “fine” with her sharing the coupleâs struggle to conceive. \n“It would’ve been odd for me not to talk about it on the show because it’s been such a huge part of our life,” she said. “I’ve been doing this for years. It’s been weird to hide it from people, but I didn’t want to just tweet, 'Doin’ my shots again!’” \nTeigen married the 36-year-old singer in September 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:21:48.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
