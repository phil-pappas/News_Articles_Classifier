(AP) — Clemson \nLast season: 16-15, did not take part in postseason. \nNickname: Tigers. Coach: Brad Brownell. \nConference: Atlantic Coast. \nKey returners: Jordan Roper, capable 3-point shooter who should take over point guard; Jaron Blossinggame, junior forward who was Clemson’s only player to average double figures last season at 13.1 points a game; Donte Grantham, sophomore forward was second on Tigers with 31 blocked shots. \nWho left: Point guard Rod Hall, was the Tigers leader the past two seasons. Damarcus Harrison, an outside shooter who was inconsistent. When he got hot, though, he took over the team. Clemson may not have a similarly streaky player. \nThe Skinny: Tigers coach Brad Brownell has had winning seasons in four of his five years in charge. Clemson, though, is playing this season about a half-hour away in Greenville while it renovates its arena and could have a difficult time making a mark in the ACC.
