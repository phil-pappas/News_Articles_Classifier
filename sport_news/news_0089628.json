It’s the first year for this week-long event so how do we know what to expect? HUBweek describes itself as a place where “art, science, and technology collide” and as an atmosphere where you can “ask why and why not.”\nBasically, this is Boston’s answer to South By Southwest, but without the music— Boston Calling’s got that covered.\nHUBweek is spread out over seven days and more than 10 areas within the city, from Kendall Square to the Seaport. Each of its more than 100 events falls into one of five featured topic categories: climate change and sustainability; future of learning and work; wellness and healthcare delivery; art and entertainment; and civic and social innovation.\nOverwhelmed by all the action? Let us suggest some fun and free things to watch out for.\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 3\nLet’s Talk About Food: 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Copley Square\nThis is actually the fourth annual Let’s Talk About Food Festival, a deep dive into the food we eat, with celebrity chefs, farmers, fishermen, nutritionists, and more.
