Photo by Eugene Bonthuys. \nHayden Roulston's return to the track continues to progress well after he won a second title at the Oceania track championship in Invercargill yesterday. \nRoulston, representing New Zealand on the boards for the first time since the 2008 Olympics, added the individual pursuit title to the team pursuit gold he won on the opening night of the four-day championship. \nAfter leading qualification by more than 1sec from Rohan Wight during the morning session, Roulston held off a determined finish from the Australian to win the final in 4min 27.552sec. \nAustralian Alex Morgan overtook New Zealander Luke Mudgway to claim bronze. \nEarlier in the night, Invercargill's Bradley Knipe proved too strong in the under-19 men's 1000m time trial, but Australia claimed the gold in both the under-19 and elite women's individual pursuit. \nGeorgia Baker headed off compatriot Macey Stewart by more than 7sec for the elite women's gold. \nWith four events completed in the under-19 men's omnium, Australian Josh Toovey had moved ahead of local rider Tom Sexton after finishing second in the flying lap. \nThe Oceania championships finish tomorrow.
