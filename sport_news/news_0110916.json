Affeldt, 36, was the 2014 World Series Game 7 winner at Kansas City and is completing an $18 million, three-year contract. \nWhile Affeldt had kept open the idea of pitching one more year when this season began, he said he would listen to his three sons to help him make the decision â€” if they wanted him home, that might win out.
