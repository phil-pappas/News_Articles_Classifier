Last year: Did not play. Cape Tech and Nantucket last played in 2010. Notes: The Whalers clinched the Mayflower Small conference with their win over West Bridgewater last week and as of Monday were ranked first in the Division 6 South standings. Alex Small and Keenan Phillips combined for 237 rushing yards and both touchdowns. Small also recovered a fumble as part of Nantucket’s defense, which in six games this year has given up just 36 total points. The Crusaders, ranked last in Division 6 South, didn’t score until the fourth quarter last week, with Justin Lukas hitting Shaborne Carter on a 13-yard touchdown pass. It was Carter’s third touchdown of the season, but Cape Tech couldn’t overcome four interceptions by Lukas. Cape Tech’s overall offense has struggled to score points; the Crusaders average only 8.8 points per game. Martha’s Vineyard at Somerset Berkley 6 p.m. at Hanson Memorial Field, Somerset Last week: Martha’s Vineyard (3-3, 1-2 EAC) beat Brighton, 49-6; Somerset Berkley (3-2, 2-1 EAC) lost to Bishop Feehan, 9-6. Last year: Somerset Berkley beat Martha’s Vineyard, 44-18. Martha’s Vineyard is 0-6 against Somerset Berkley since 2009. Notes: The Vineyarders exploded for 426 rushing yards last week, with all seven of their touchdowns coming on the ground. Ben Clark scored three times for Martha’s Vineyard, the other four touchdowns going to Austin Chandler, Jacob Cardoza, Austin Chandler and Curtis Farrell. Chandler also rushed for 109 yards on 11 carries. Clark and Cardoza both scored against the Raiders last year, but Somerset Berkley used four unanswered touchdowns to easily take the Eastern Athletic Conference match. The Vineyarders are currently 12th in Division 5 South; the Raiders are fifth in Division 3 Southeast. Martha’s Vineyard has scored in the 40s twice in six games, but two shutouts to EAC opponents cost the Vineyarders in the standings. Dartmouth at Barnstable 7 p.m. at W. Leo Shields Memorial Field, Hyannis Last week: Dartmouth (4-2, 0-1 OCL) beat Coyle-Cassidy, 21-6; Barnstable (1-5, 0-1 OCL) lost to Bridgewater-Raynham, 48-24. Last year: Dartmouth beat Barnstable, 34-15. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Barnstable from 2009-13. Notes: The Red Raiders’ passing game has looked much improved since Bryce Conroy took over as starting quarterback in Week 5, with Conroy throwing three touchdown passes in two games. He connected with Will O’Day and Nate Balthazard against Bridgewater-Raynham, and Ryan Dauphinais gave Barnstable a brief lead with a touchdown run before B-R scored 41 unanswered points. Defense remains Barnstable’s biggest problem this season. The Red Raiders have allowed just over 40 points per game while scoring just 15.7. Despite all that, Barnstable still has a shot at the playoffs, holding the same overall record as eighth-place Quincy in Division 2 South. Barnstable, ranked ninth, could leapfrog Quincy with a win against the Old Colony League-rival Indians, ranked second in Division 3 Southeast. Greater New Bedford Voke at Bourne 7 p.m. at Jackson Field, Bourne Last week: Greater New Bedford Voke (4-2, 2-0 SCC-Small) beat Case, 47-20; Bourne (1-4, 0-2 SCC-Small) lost to Fairhaven, 45-0. Last year: Greater New Bedford Voke beat Bourne, 51-30. Bourne last beat Greater New Bedford Voke in 2012. Notes: The Canalmen were shut out for the first time all season last week, snapping a streak of four games in which their offense averaged 29 points per game. Bourne rushed for 330 yards against the Bears last year, and this season the Canalmen have had multiple players rush for the end zone. Tyler Rondeau and Jacob Haypenny combined for three rushing touchdowns in Week 5, and Rondeau also completed a touchdown pass to Spencer Ross. Bourne is averaging 13 points fewer on offense than allowed on defense (21.6 vs. 34.6), so two more defensive stops could be all that stands between Bourne and its first South Coast Conference Small win. A trip to the playoffs remains unlikely, however, as Bourne ranks last in Division 5 South. Greater New Bedford Voke ranks eighth, having scored a season-high 47 points but allowing a season-high 20 against Case in Week 6. Monomoy at Mashpee 7 p.m. at Michael S. Horne Stadium, Mashpee Last week: Monomoy (2-4, 0-3 SSL-Small) lost to Cohasset by forfeit; Mashpee (4-2, 2-1 SSL-Small) beat St. John Paul II, 42-14. Last year: Mashpee beat Monomoy, 34-18. Mashpee also beat Monomoy in 2013. Notes: Mashpee running back Deshaun Dias rushed for two touchdowns against the Sharks last year, and his dominance has continued this season. Dias, a senior and Mashpee’s all-time leader in touchdowns, is coming off a 200-yard, three-touchdown performance against St. John Paul II in Week 6 that saw him break the 1,000-yard rushing mark for the season and up his touchdown total to 18. Dias is second in the state in rushing yards and first in rushing touchdowns. The other three touchdowns coming on runs by Nick Carpenter and Emmett Sweeney and Carpenter’s 12-yard pass to Joseph Spinola. Mashpee is currently second in the South Shore League Small heading into its final conference game and ranks sixth in Division 6 South. Monomoy, ranked 17th, had to forfeit to Cohasset last week due to injuries that left the Sharks with just 12 healthy players. Drew Senatore, who threw two touchdown passes against Mashpee last year, scored the Sharks’ lone touchdown in Week 5, their last game. Nauset at Durfee 7 p.m. in Fall River Last week: Nauset (0-6, 0-4 ACL) lost to Marshfield, 36-8; Durfee (1-5, 0-1 Big Three) lost to Brockton, 48-27. Last year: Durfee beat Nauset, 13-7. Nauset beat Durfee in 2013. Notes: The Warriors’ last three losses, all within the Atlantic Coast League, were by a combined score of 111-22, so maybe a nonconference game is just what they need to finally end their losing streak. Junior quarterback Travis Van Vleck scored Nauset’s lone touchdown last week, rushing 17 yards to the end zone and following it with a successful run on the two-point conversion. Van Vleck has also found Sam McGough three times in the end zone for touchdown passes. Durfee’s Elijah Brooks scored both touchdowns against Nauset in 2014, rushing for 85 yards, and this season has already put up 1,032 rushing yards and eight touchdowns. Durfee ranks 10th in Division 2 South and could still make the playoffs with losses by Barnstable and Quincy; Nauset is 11th in Division 3 Southeast. Falmouth at Dennis-Yarmouth 7 p.m. at Alan Carlsen Field, South Yarmouth Last week: Falmouth (5-1, 2-1 ACL) beat Sandwich, 19-14; Dennis-Yarmouth (3-2, 2-1 ACL) did not play. D-Y beat Nauset, 34-0, in Week 5. Last year: D-Y beat Falmouth, 44-21. Falmouth last defeated D-Y in 2009. Notes: This game will decide second place in the ACL. Andrew Jamiel led the Dolphins with 99 rushing yards and three touchdowns against Nauset in Week 5, the game ending at halftime due to lightning. Jamiel now has 14 touchdowns this season, twice crossing the 200-yard rushing mark. Falmouth won last week without regular starting quarterback Nick Couhig, who’d scored 14 touchdowns through five games but sat out with an injury to his non-throwing shoulder. The Clippers instead won on the strength of touchdown runs by Julian Somers and backup quarterback Collin Almeida, plus an interception-return touchdown by senior captain Jake Campbell. Couhig rushed for two touchdowns and threw for a third against D-Y last year, but the Dolphins outgained the Clippers in total yardage, 203-170. Marshfield at Sandwich 7 p.m. at Captain Gerald F. DeConto, USN Veterans Memorial Stadium, East Sandwich Last week: Marshfield (6-0, 3-0 ACL) beat Nauset, 36-8; Sandwich (3-3, 1-2 ACL) lost to Falmouth, 19-14. Last year: Marshfield beat Sandwich, 28-6. Sandwich last beat Marshfield in 2012. Notes: Blue Knights quarterback Tyler Cairns accounted for both touchdowns against Falmouth last week, rushing 75 yards for one and connecting with Cameron Lopes on a 12-yard pass for the second. Sandwich enters its final ACL game tied with Whitman-Hanson for seventh in Division 3 Southeast, a game ahead of Sharon, which beat Sandwich in Week 2. The Blue Knights have collectively outscored their opponents this season, but only barely, averaging 22.8 on offense and 20.7 allowed on defense. Jack Masterson threw three touchdowns for Marshfield last week against Nauset as the Rams scored 34 unanswered points in the first half. Marshfield, the defending Division 2 state champion, enters tonight’s game ranked first in Division 2 South. A special dedication ceremony honoring Sandwich graduate and slain naval captain Gerald F. DeConto, for whom the stadium was named, will take place before the game. Sean Stackley, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, will be the keynote speaker, with several of DeConto’s other Naval Academy classmates also expected to attend. SATURDAY’S GAMES South Shore Voke at Upper Cape Noon in Bourne Last week: South Shore Voke (4-2, 3-2 MAC-Small) beat Cape Tech, 30-6; Upper Cape (4-2, 3-2 MAC-Small) beat Holbrook/Avon, 34-6. Last year: Upper Cape beat South Shore Voke, 43-8. Upper Cape has won its last three games against South Shore Voke. Notes: Tonight’s winner takes third place in the MAC-Small. The Rams are 10th in Division 6 South, one spot ahead of the Vikings, who have identical records. Upper Cape is coming off great performances by senior captain Kyle Johnson and junior running back Jay Allen, the two combining for 185 yards and two rushing touchdowns against Holbrook/Avon. David Coakley finished the scoring with two passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown, connecting with James Abbe for the second straight game and also finding Tyler Glover in the end zone. Kyle Thompson rushed for two South Shore Voke touchdowns last week, and the Vikings also got a touchdown run from Richie Lobo and an 18-yard interception return from James Huff. Thompson and Lobo combined for 170 rushing touchdowns. Abbe caught a touchdown pass and Allen and Johnson both rushed for touchdowns against South Shore Voke last year. Matignon vs. St. John Paul II 7 p.m. at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Buzzards Bay Last week: Matignon (0-5, 0-4 Catholic Small) lost to Lowell Catholic, 39-6; St. John Paul II (3-3, 3-1 Catholic Small) lost to Mashpee, 42-14. Last year: SJP II beat Matignon, 37-12. SJP II is 4-0 against Matignon since 2011. Notes: A Lions win could potentially set up a three-way tie for first in the Catholic Conference Small, with both SJP II and Cathedral able to tie St. Clement, which is done with its conference schedule, with victories. The Lions are currently are ninth in Division 6 South. Their two touchdowns last week didn’t come until Mashpee led 42-0, with Jake Catarius rushing for the first and Johnny Warden passing to Cole Campbell for the second. Warden caught a touchdown pass against the Unified team last year, and Campbell returned a blocked point-after 98 yards for two points on the opposite ends. Timmy Jordan and Keith Campbell, both big contributors to the Lions this season, also scored against Matignon/St. Joseph’s Prep in 2014, a game which clinched a Catholic Small title for SJP II. capecodtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:17:52.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
