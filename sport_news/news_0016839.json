Rated as a three-star dual threat across the board, Wood signed as an athlete and could fit into a number of roles at UK. Let‚Äôs break down the new recruit. (Click on the blue links to watch highlights of Wood courtesy of Hudl.com) So happy to say that I've committed to the University of Kentucky! So blessed to have the best people in my lifeüîµ‚ö™Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/KDoDf8vn2C \n‚Äî Walker Wood (@Wood7Walker) October 15, 2015 \nWood is extremely versatile. Lafayette uses him on the ground as much as they do in the air. Wood has the footwork and agility to run the read option with ease at the 6A level. I watched him in person for the first time against Scott County . He showed great touch on his passes and threw the deep ball very well. He is protected by two of the top offensive lineman (Landon Young and JeDrick Wills) and has Wofford-commit Mason Alstatt in the backfield. Even with all these studs on his team, Wood still was the player who stood out to me the most. Wood is extremely mobile and can make great plays on the run (once again, watch the Hudl tape). He is signed on to be an athlete, meaning he could play a variety of positions when he comes on campus. \nWood said he would like to compete for the quarterback position. He will battle against Drew Barker, Gunner Hoak, and Mac Jones in the next couple years. He definitely has the intangibles to compete for the spot. \nLook for this post to be updated throughout the day. \nArticle written by Trey Huntsman Keepin' fresh since '96.
