That changed against Washington as Bradford completed four passes that traveled at least 30 yards.\n“Obviously, it’s good to finally put that on tape,” Bradford said. “It’s not something we’ve been trying to shy away from. It just hadn’t presented itself until last Sunday. But now that it’s out there, I think teams have to respect us pushing the ball down the field. Obviously, it’s something we’re going to try to do.”\nBradford said it’s all part of feeling more comfortable in the Eagles’ offense. He had the second highest quarterback rating of his career at 122.6, completing 15 of 28 passes for 270 yards and three touchdowns.\nThat was especially true in the second half, when the Eagles rallied from a 13-0 deficit to take a 20-16 lead before losing 23-20 in the final minute.\n“I think in that second half, we just kind of found a rhythm,” Bradford said. “I found a rhythm where I was just really confident out there in everything that we were doing. I feel like once … you get that confidence, then you start making some throws that you feel like they can’t cover.”\nBradford was then asked if the Saints are a team like Washington that will present him with opportunities for deep throws.\n“We’re going to try,” he said. “We feel like maybe we have some speed mismatches outside this week with some of our wide receivers against their corners. It’s all going to be dependent on how they play us. If they want to play us in man, then we’re going to take some shots. If they want to play us more two-high [safeties] or zone, then we have to be willing to work the intermediate stuff.”\nJohnson to left tackle?\nEagles coach Chip Kelly said Lane Johnson could be moving to left tackle this Sunday if Jason Peters isn’t ready to return from his quadriceps injury Sunday.\nJohnson has played right tackle ever since the Eagles made him their first-round pick in 2014 (fourth overall). But Kelly’s statement could indicate that Peters might not be ready for the game against the Saints.\nJohnson hasn’t practiced this week yet, either, because of a sprained MCL suffered Sunday. Johnson said he will practice Thursday and play in the game Sunday. When he does practice, he’ll be playing a position he hasn’t played since his senior year at Oklahoma.\n“It’s been a while,” Johnson said. “That’s the plan. I’m willing to play left or right, but I need to get some reps over there.”\nKelly said he wouldn’t make the move unless Johnson got some practice reps at left tackle. He said there are other options, too, such as Matt Tobin, who played left tackle after Peters left the game at the end of the first quarter. Tobin started the game at right guard because Andrew Gardner had gone on season-ending injured reserve. When he moved to left tackle, Dennis Kelly came in at right guard.\nIf Johnson moves to left tackle, then Tobin would presumably stay at right guard and Kelly would play right tackle.\n“I’ll be ready,” Johnson said. “So just spur of the moment, you’ve got to be on your toes at all times.”\nWing tips\n>>Left guard Allen Barbre returned to practice Wednesday after sitting out practice Tuesday. Kelly wouldn’t say what Barbre’s injury was, but Barbre said it was a groin strain.\n>>Those who sat out practice Wednesday, in addition to Peters, were CB Byron Maxwell (quad), ILBs Mychal Kendricks (hamstring), Kiko Alonso (knee), and DE Brandon Bair (groin).\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
