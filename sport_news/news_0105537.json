Swanberg , who served nearly 28 years as a Canby police officer, filed the retaliation suit last year against the City of Canby, Police Chief Bret Smith and Lt. Jorge Tro. He alleged that the city, chief and lieutenant forced him into retirement after he filed a lawsuit alleging police corruption.\nThe jury before U.S. District Judge Marco A. Hernandez found that Smith had not retaliated against Swanberg. Earlier this week, Hernandez dismissed the city as a defendant.\nThe four-man, four-woman jury ruled that Swanberg was entitled to $109,000 for economic and emotional distress, and $12,000 in punitive damages.\nIt was not immediately clear what portion of the judgment, if any, would be left to Tro to pay. He left the courthouse with lawyer Karen Vickers before they could be asked to comment.\nThe jury also ruled that the city must give Swanberg his photo retirement identification card and retirement badge, a memento the officer described as very significant.\n\"It's what all police officers work for,\" he said.\n\"It clears his name,\" said Stephen L. Brischetto, one of Swanberg's lawyers.\nSwanberg, now a campus public safety officer at the University of Portland, got crossways with Canby police officials twice in the years leading up to his termination.\nIn 2009, he sued the city, alleging corruption and criminal activity in the police department that included Tro. The following year, Swanberg took part in an Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries investigation into whether city officials engaged in gender discrimination against a fellow officer, Teresa Britton.\nSwanberg alleges in his latest lawsuit that he told state investigators in the sex-discrimination case that then-Police Chief Greg Kroeplin spoke ill of female police officers, wanted to get rid of them and that \"female officers were nothing but problems.\"\nIn September 2010, the Bureau of Labor and Industries determined there was substantial evidence that the city had engaged in unlawful gender discrimination against Britton. Investigators also found that Swanberg's statements to investigators were credible and that Tro was \"not credible,\" according to Swanberg's lawsuit.\nIn April 2012, Smith and Tro notified Swanberg that he was under investigation for the manner in which he handled a March 27 domestic disturbance call involving two stepsisters. Swanberg's superiors alleged that he was required to file a report, failed to, then lied to them when they brought him in to discuss the matter.\nThat May, Tro and Smith pursued an investigation of Swanberg for alleged untruthfulness. The following month, they told their subordinate that they planned to terminate him for cause. So on June 18, 2012, Swanberg resigned under pressure rather than be fired for cause, which would hurt future employment opportunities.\nCanby police officials then reported to the state police certification board that Swanberg had resigned while under investigation. The panel sought to revoke Swanberg's police certification.\nDuring a two-day hearing before the board in 2013, Tro conceded that he held animosity for Swanberg because his subordinate had sued the city in 2009 and took part in Britton's complaint to state labor investigators, according to Swanberg's lawsuit.\nOn Oct. 29, 2013, an administrative law judge appointed by the police certification board found Tro's investigation \"sloppy and insufficient,\" according to the suit, raising many questions \"about whether Swanberg's superiors at CPD were using the (domestic disturbance) incident as a vehicle to remove him from the force.\"\nThe police certification board dismissed the revocation proceedings against Swanberg.\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["http://www.up.edu/publicsafety/", "https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/specialty-areas/administrative-law-judge-positions/", "https://twitter.com/Bryan_Denson", "http://www.canbypolice.com/"], "published": "2015-10-17T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:44:20.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
