(AP Photo/Alan Diaz) The only surprise was that Dan Campbell waited three days to make the decision after being named interim head coach. Coyle inherited a respectable defensive unit in 2012 but presided over a steady decline that not even the $114 million addition of Ndamukong Suh has reversed.\nThe Dolphins rank 30th in the league defensively, giving up 399.5 yards per game. Despite a star-studded defensive front, they have a league-worst one sack amid a 1-3 start that cost coach Joe Philbin his job.\nNow, this is Anarumo’s problem. His shuffled staff will include Jeff Burris, who was promoted from defensive assistant to assistant defensive backs coach. Burris will work primarily with cornerbacks. Assistant defensive backs coach Blue Adams will continue to handle the safeties.\nCampbell said he knew Anarumo is “the right man for this job,” adding, “Lou and I see eye-to-eye about what we need to do defensively.”\nExactly what that is, we don’t know. In a brief conference call with reporters, Anarumo said he’d only been aware of his promotion for about an hour and hadn’t had time to gather thoughts on necessary changes, schematically or otherwise.\n“The good news for us is that we are on a bye week, so we are getting into looking into everything that we are doing and communicating with the guys,” Anarumo said.\nAnarumo has served as defensive backs coach at Purdue and Marshall and was assistant head coach at Harvard. But the last time he served as a defensive coordinator was 1992-94, with the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.\nA huge task awaits. In addition to ranking ahead of only Oakland and Cleveland in overall defense, the Dolphins are last in the league against the run.\nIn 2012, Coyle took over a defense that had been third in the league against the run and 25th against the pass. Under him, Miami’s defensive rankings against the run were 13th, 24th, 24th and currently 32nd.\nThis season is a continuation of last season, when the Dolphins conceded an average of 165.3 rushing yards per game over the final six weeks. The Dolphins hoped that with Suh clogging the middle, things would look vastly different; instead, they are giving up 160.5 rushing yards per game.\n“We are going to look at all avenues when it comes to all of our players, especially with Suh as great and dominant of a player as he has been,” Anarumo said. “I think the guy goes out there and works hard every day and gives us his all.”\nThe Post reported that a prominent defensive player recently went to owner Stephen Ross — bypassing Philbin — with concerns about Coyle. The Dolphins ranked 15th defensively the year before Coyle joined them as coordinator, then dropped to 21st, 21st and 12th last season.\nPerhaps even worse, the Dolphins went from having the sixth-ranked scoring defense pre-Coyle to currently 19th at 25.2 points per game.\nAlthough many players are quick to say it’s on them to make plays that they haven’t made thus far, Anarumo indicated much of the onus is on coaches to get them in position to do so.\n“I think it is important whether you are talking about the defensive line, the linebackers or the DBs that these guys are playing with confidence,” Anarumo said. “Every one of those guys up front has demonstrated in their career that they can be productive players and that is going to be our charge as coaches to get that out of them going forward.”\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/08/1a/b0/Dolphins-New-Football.JPEG-.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:35:47.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
