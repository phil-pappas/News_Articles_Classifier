Slugging stars Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion also sat out. \nAfter Toronto clinched the division crown in the opener of a doubleheader Wednesday, Gibbons fielded a starting unit consisting entirely of reserves in the nightcap. He posted a similar lineup Thursday, in part because the Blue Jays had celebrated their division crown with champagne, beer and cigars late into the night. \nThe Blue Jays started the day with 92 wins, one more than Kansas City. Toronto finishes with three games at Tampa Bay, beginning Friday. \nThursday's game was originally slated to start at 7:05 p.m. ET but was moved up to 12:05 because of the threat of rain at night. As it turned out, the rain started early in the day and didn't let up until around 4 o'clock. \nAttendance was announced at 18,257, but that was tickets sold. At the outset, there was only a smattering of fans, mostly because of the dismal weather, the switch of the starting time and the Orioles' late-season fade. \nAfter the lengthy delay, only a few hundred remained. \nIt became apparent early that the Blue Jays were going to experience a figurative hangover from their big day. Hutchison gave up a one-out single in the first inning and Machado followed with a home run to center. \nChris Davis and Steve Pearce then sandwiched doubles around a hit batter for a 3-0 lead. \nNot long after that, the game was halted. Neither starting pitcher returned. \nTodd McFarland (1-2) took over for Tyler Wright and pitched four innings to earn his first win since July 27, 2014. \nZach Britton worked the ninth for his 35th save. \nIt was 5-1 before Machado hit a solo shot in the sixth off Chad Jenkins. Machado also stole two bases, giving him 33 homers and 20 steals and making him the seventh 20/20 player in Orioles history. \nEzequiel Carrera drove in two runs and Dalton Pompey had three hits for the Blue Jays, who won the season series 11-8. Trainer's room \nBlue Jays: SS Troy Tulowitzki (shoulder, back) could return this weekend. \nOrioles: 2B Jonathan Schoop bruised his right hand after being struck by a pitch from Hutchison. On deck \nBlue Jays: Toronto needs to win two of three in Tampa Bay to finish with a winning record on the road. \nOrioles: The Orioles finish the season with a three-game series at home against the Yankees beginning Friday night, although Hurricane Joaquin could shuffle that schedule.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:06:45.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
