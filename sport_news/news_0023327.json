(AP) - For the first time in the 2015 football season, there were no repeat winners in the selection for Louisiana Sports Writers Association Players of the Week. \nQuarterback Austin Howard, defensive end Jaylon Ferguson of Louisiana Tech and UL-Lafayette returner Jeryl Brazil earned the honors of the panel of LSWA voters. \nHoward accounted for six touchdowns in a 45-34 Southern win over Alabama State, while Ferguson earned the defensive honor in his first career start (a 34-31 win for Tech over UTSA). Brazil posted a 100-yard kick return to garner special team honors in the Cajuns’ 49-27 victory over Texas State. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:29:02.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
