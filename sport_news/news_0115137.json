Posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 4:30 am UMHB faces 2-week test; Cru’s playoff hopes ride on upcoming games BY ERIC DRENNAN | TELEGRAM STAFF Killeen Daily Herald | 0 comments \nBELTON — The postseason fate of Mary Hardin-Baylor, Texas Lutheran and Hardin-Simmons is a matter of simple mathematics. \nThe team with the fewest losses will receive the country’s lone Pool B bid for the NCAA Division III playoffs. A squad that finishes with one defeat will be in the running to garner one of a handful of Pool C bids. A team with two losses is finished. \nWith that in mind, UMHB’s postseason future will be much clearer by the time Halloween night rolls around. The No. 2-ranked Crusaders (6-0) host Texas Lutheran (5-1) at 1 p.m. Saturday and face No. 12 Hardin-Simmons (6-0) on Oct. 31 in Abilene. \nIt’s the Crusaders’ biggest two-week stretch of regular-season games in quite some time. \n“This is the reason you play and coach,” UMHB coach Pete Fredenburg said. “This is what motivates you in January and all through the spring and summer.” \nUMHB is 16-1 all-time against TLU and hasn’t lost to the Bulldogs since 1999. The teams met twice last season, with UMHB winning 72-16 in Seguin during the regular season and 27-20 in Belton in the first round of the playoffs. \nThe postseason clash was spread over two days after lightning caused lengthy delays. The game featured only 35 offensive plays — 40 below their average — for the Crusaders, whose opportunities were limited as the Bulldogs piled up 452 yards while using up every possible second on the play clock each time they snapped the ball. \nHardin-Simmons — a 35-27 winner over Texas Lutheran on Sept. 12 — hasn’t beaten UMHB since prevailing 49-22 on Oct. 23, 2004. The Crusaders won the playoff rematch that year on their way to the national championship game and have defeated the Cowboys 13 straight times as one of the American Southwest Conference’s top rivalries has turned one-sided. \nASC honor \nUMHB’s Jon Isom was named ASC Defensive Player of the Week for his performance in Saturday’s 54-6 victory at Louisiana College. \nThe senior end from Klein Forest set a conference single-game record with five sacks, breaking the mark of 4½ set by teammate Haston Adams two weeks earlier. Isom also set a program single-game record with six tackles for losses. \nWorld record attempt \nAt halftime on Saturday at Crusader Stadium, there will be an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for most people doing push-ups for one minute. The attempt serves as a fund raiser for Hope for the Hungry and the Educate Haiti program and is a joint effort of Hope for the Hungry and the UMHB student-athlete advisory committee. \nParticipants receive free admission to the game and a T-shirt. More information on the event is available at the Hope for the Hungry website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:40:24.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
