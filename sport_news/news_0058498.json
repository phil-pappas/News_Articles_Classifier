It's very simple why they played in the Stanley Cup Finals last year,\" Howard said. \"They're one of the best teams in the East, we think we're very comparable. I thought we showed that tonight.\" \nZetterberg gave the Red Wings a 2-0 lead at 8:25 of the third period, taking a nice pass from Dylan Larkin and firing in a wrist shot from the slot with Justin Abdelkader providing a screen. \nZetterberg has six points (two goals, four assists) in three games. He scored just three goals in his first 37 games, including the playoffs, last season. \nPlaying with the speedy rookie Larkin seems to have energized him. Larkin has four points (goal, three assists). \nIt proved to be the deciding goal after Ryan Callahan blasted in a one-timer shortly after a faceoff at 11:03. That goal snapped Howard's season-opening shutout streak at 111:03. \nKyle Quincey sealed the victory with an empty-net goal with 1:48 to play. Off the faceoff, Quincey scored by firing the puck down the ice from deep in his own end. \n\"I thought overall, after the first half of the first (period), we played really well,\" Blashill said. \"Overall as a group we managed the puck pretty well. We had some turnovers but they were isolated a little bit. I was really happy with the way we played.\" \nBlashill said of Howard, who has allowed just one goal in two games: \"Obviously, confidence is a big deal. It didn't finish the way he wanted to finish (last season), but I also remember the first half of the year when he was real good and picked to be an All-Star and I think he's back in that form. I think this is what Jimmy is, this is what Jimmy has proven over the longevity of his career and I think he's done a real good job, but it's good to get that confidence back.\" \nThe Red Wings killed three Lightning power plays, two of them in the third period. \n\"We did a great job,\" Howard said. \"We didn't give them long to set up, only a couple of times and if they had possession, they worked it on the outside.\" \nIt was a tight-checking, low-shot, low-chance game for most of two periods. \nThe biggest cheer from the crowd came when Abdelkader leveled Alex Killorn with a big open-ice hit with four minutes to play. \n\"It kind of worked out good because I was back-checking and he kind of turned right into me,\" Abdelkader said. \"So right spot, right time for a hit like that I guess.\"I try to bring that physical edge and lead the team that way up front.\" \nGustav Nyquist then opened the scoring at 17:52, just 12 seconds after Matt Carle was penalized for tripping him. Nyquist beat Ben Bishop with a wrist shot from the faceoff circle with Abdelkader providing a screen. It was Nyquist's first goal. \nBishop entered the game with a 7-2-0 career regular season record and 1.68 goals-against average against the Red Wings. \nJohan Franzen was a late scratch for the Red Wings. He wasn't feeling 100 percent; the club isn't sure if it's related to his previous concussions so he was kept out as a precaution. \nThe Red Wings are off to their best start since going 5-0 in 2011-12, but Zetterberg kept it in perspective. \n\"We're still working things out here,\" Zetterberg said. \"It's been some tight games but obviously it's nice to get three wins, but it's a long season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:49:25.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
