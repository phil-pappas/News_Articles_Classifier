Panthers coming off a couple of tough losses one or two plays each way could have changed the outcome.. \nMark: Yeah just one score games a touchdown either way-- penalties and self inflicted wounds.. \nRick Even the pollsters still have you ranked despite the 2-4 record. But all it takes is one win to get momentum.. \nMark: Soon as we click and gain that momentum that win--I have no doubt that we can run the table but we have to get over that hump and that hump is difficult now because we go into South Dakota State... \nRick : South Dakota State has homecoming like you last week your last game at Coughlin Stadium--tough team only one loss to North Dakota State..Their quarterback Zach Lujan is supposed to be back but the beck Tayrn Chrstion the dual threat quarterback has played well.. \nMark: Yeah they are a good football team --they've only lost one football game and they were down some guys in that one..So I expect to see the best out of them its their homecoming. \nRick Last couple of games very close games with them what kin of mentality do you go into that game with... \nMark We have to go in there with a lot of confidence on offense--the defense should be okay but the offense has to pick it up. We are playing from behind all the time now we need to get the lead..like we did in the Cal Poly game and against Eastern Washington. \nRick How do you attack a defense from South Dakota State that is playing pretty good? \nMark: It starts with the run game if we can run the football we can open things up in the passing game... \nRick You are used to going into tough environments.. \nMark. Yes we have done that a lot this year and it is no different this week... \nRick South Dakota State /Northern Iowa this Saturday big game for you--hopefully we can come out with a win \nMark ...yes it should be a great game", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:24:54.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
