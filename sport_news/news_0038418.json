Antonio Cromartie may think that Odell Beckham is a “ one-year wonder .” But Odell Beckham doesn’t exactly think much of that.\nOn Thursday, the Giants receiver was asked about Cromartie, the Jets cornerback who, in a televised interview on ESPN, had pointed to Beckham’s short resume as a key reason why he didn’t belong on a list of the NFL’s top three receivers. And Beckham didn’t much care.\n“That’s cool,” Beckham said. “It’s just words. That’s all it is.”\nBeckham said he hadn’t even heard Cromartie’s comments, which had come on Friday.\nVACCHIANO: BAD HAMMIE CAN'T STOP OBJ IN GIANTS WIN\n“Keep moving forward,” he said. “Keep doing what you’re doing. Keep trying to get better and be a better person day by day. I’m not really worried about what anybody else has to say who’s not on the Giants.\n“There’s so much stuff that goes on it doesn’t really faze me,” he added. “Not really aware of it.”\nBeckham has other things on his mind in this particular week too. The second-year receiver is once again battling a hamstring injury , and he did not practice on Thursday, as the Giants began preparations for a key NFC East showdown against the rival Eagles in Philadelphia.\nRELATED: TOP 10 PLAYS IN GIANTS HISTORY\nCorey Sipkin/New York Daily News Antonio Cromartie calls Odell Beckham a ‘one-year wonder.’ It’s the latest hamstring issue for Beckham, who began his career by missing all of his first training camp and the first four games of his rookie year with hamstring woes and battled another hamstring injury in the spring and the summer.\nBut Beckham, who leads the Giants with 31 catches for 428 yards and three TDs in a start to 2015 that’s been more solid than spectacular, said that his current hamstring issue is “not even close” to the struggles he endured in 2014. Beckham injured his hamstring at the end of the third quarter in Sunday’s come-from-behind victory over the San Francisco 49ers, but he managed to return on the game’s final drive.\nOfficially, Beckham did not practice on Thursday, although he ran on the side and did not seem hobbled. He desperately wanted to be on the practice field, honing his chemistry with quarterback Eli Manning, he said.\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID OR iOS\n“I personally like practicing and being able to go through your routes and you get reps,” he said. “That way when it comes to game time you’ve already seen it, you’ve run it, you’ve repped it.”\nHe can’t do that, but he still has a shot to play Monday.\n“Right now I feel like it’s day-to-day,” he said. “So we’ll see.”\nRelated Stories Jets' Cromartie calls Giants' Beckham a 'one-year wonder' Vacchiano: Bad hammy can't stop Odell Beckham Jr. Odell Beckham Jr. hurts hamstring, return is questionable Tags: odell beckham jr. , antonio cromartie", "external_links": ["http://nydn.us/app"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:47:58.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
