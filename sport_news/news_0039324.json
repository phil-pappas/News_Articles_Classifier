Who would have figured that a modest, family friendly modern house built in the 1950s could be priced at a million bucks by the time the kids grew up and retired?\nAnd we're not just talking about crazy-about-the-Jet Age places like Palm Springs. In that always sunny California desert city, what's touted as \"the most famous midcentury modern celebrity home\" – a house at 1350 Ladera Circle designed by architect William Kriesel – is listed at almost $7 million.\nIt's cool features includes that the 5,000-square-foot house is four large circles, making rooms curvy.\nGeometric design aside, this pad is sexy. It was the honeymoon hideaway of Elvis and Priscilla Beaulieu Presley. And there's a secret passageway out of the master bathroom to the getaway car in the garage.\nIts official name is the the Robert and Helene Alexander Estate, but Look magazine named it the \"Home of Tomorrow\" in 1962. It hasn't been on the market for almost 30 years (you can still use the original intercom system).\nIn the living room, a custom sofa stretches 40 feet along the main wall and faces a 360-degree open fireplace with a story-high corrugated steel hood, according to marketing materials.\nBut Portland has its Rat Pack Vibe too.\nFor this week's real estate gallery, we look at a collection of midcentury modern houses – some with pedigrees like J ohn Yeon's 1953 Swan House that sold for almost $2 million in July. Others were designed by unknown architects but still command high seven figures.\n-- Janet Eastman\njeastman@oregonian.com\n503-799-8739\n@janeteastman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/janeteastman", "https://www.redfin.com/OR/Portland/4645-SW-Fairview-Blvd-97221/home/25764549", "http://www.1350laderacircle.com/"], "published": "2015-10-10T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:30:08.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
