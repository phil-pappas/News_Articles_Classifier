But Amy Yang's final round Sunday at the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship might have been rarer still.\nAdChoices No one on the LPGA Tour had ever birdied every hole on the back nine in one round -- until Yang did it at Sky 72's Ocean course. Here's the approach and putt she had to sink to achieve that rare feat:\nYang's 27 tied the lowest nine-hole total in LPGA history. Her nine consecutive birdies matched the record set by Beth Daniel in 1999, and her 62 tied the course record set by Sung Hyun Park on Thursday.\nDespite her outstanding, record-setting round, Yang still finished in a tie for fourth, two shots behind winner Lexi Thompson.\nEven Yang was stunned and surprised by her hot finish, according to the Quote: she gave the Associated Press afterward.\n\"I don't know what just happened. Just can't believe. Shots were great. Early in the week I was shaky, but I don't know, this back nine was crazy good.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:55:07.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
