The ship has not been heard from since it lost power when Hurricane Joaquin roared by the Bahamas on Thursday. Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss said late Sunday morning that a container has been spotted but \"we haven't been able to confirm yet whether it is from El Faro\" or fell off another cargo ship in the vast expanse of the Atlantic being scoured by rescuers. Doss said swells in the search area had decreased \"by quite a bit\" Sunday, allowing the Coast Guard to dispatch one of its cutters. ___ 9:20 a.m. Aircraft have returned to the southeastern Bahamas to resume searching for a U.S. cargo ship with 33 people on board. The craft lost power and communications when it was caught in Hurricane Joaquin and has not been heard from since. U.S. Coast Guard, Navy and Air Force planes and helicopters are expected to spend Sunday looking for the ship across a broad expanse of the Atlantic Ocean around Crooked Island, which the ship was passing when it was battered by fierce winds and waves by what was then a Category 4 hurricane.
