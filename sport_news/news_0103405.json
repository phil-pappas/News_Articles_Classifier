Though Goodes countered by saying he was a “little bit crook that day.” \nLongmire said Goodes’ toughness had been under-played. \nHe referred to the 2012 grand final when Goodes played through the second half with a major knee injury which subsequently prevented him for running for 12 weeks. \n“After the third time of me asking him how his knee was through the 20-minute halftime break, he looked me dead in the eye and said ‘listen, I’m alright,'” Longmire said. \n“In other words `will you shut up coach?’ \n“It was a courageous and very, very tough performance.” \nLongmire recalled another memorable conversation with Goodes early in the 2015 season, when the veteran voluntarily dropped himself to the reserves. \n“He’s one of the greatest players that’s ever played the game saying `no problem mate, I’ll go and play reserves’. Incredible,” Longmire said. \nGoodes played in the Sydney side that broke the club’s 72-year premiership drought in 2005 and was part of the 2012 team that upset Hawthorn, who have gone on to win the next three grand finals. \n“A great experience and a great victory because they are a fantastic team and we had to play out of our skins to win that game,” Goodes said of the 2012 triumph.
