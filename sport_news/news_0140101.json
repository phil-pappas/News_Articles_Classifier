(Photo by Omar Vega/LatinContent/Getty Images) Mexico forward Giovani dos Santos will miss the CONCACAF Cup playoff against the United States with a muscle strain.\nDos Santos earned a place in Mexico’s 23-man squad for the one-off match at the Rose Bowl on Saturday (live, 8:00p.m. ET, FS1, FOX Sports GO), but he sustained the knock in LA Galaxy’s 1-1 draw against Seattle Sounders on Sunday.\nAdChoices “Giovani has a muscular problem and he cannot be with us,” Mexico interim manager Ricardo Ferretti said during a press conference on Monday. “We are seeing who will settle into the team instead.”\nLA Galaxy confirmed dos Santos' injury in a statement and noted he would remain with the club this week.\nFerretti opened Mexico camp on Monday with 22 players as the FMF weighed potential options to replace dos Santos in camp, but he did not reveal who would take dos Santos’ place.\nClub León midfielder Carlos Peña and Pachuca defender Miguel Herrera offer potential options after missing out on a spot in the final squad, while Tigres UANL winger Jurgen Damm and León forward Elias Hernández could also enter the reckoning if Ferretti wants another option in the attacking third.\n“I do not want to mention names because we first have to do things ethically,” Ferretti said. “If I mention them to you before talking with their teams, I think it would be disrespecting the clubs.”\nMexico and the U.S. are allowed to make changes to their 23-man rosters in the case of documented injuries. Those alterations can be made up to 24 hours before kickoff, according to CONCACAF regulations.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/guardado-and-marquez-included-in-mexico-roster-for-playoff-vs-us-100515"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:17:42.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
