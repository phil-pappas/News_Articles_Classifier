(Photo by Harry How/Getty Images) In a game where the Padres were playing for nothing but respect and a love of the game while the Dodgers were playing for home field advantage in the playoffs, the advantage went to the team that needed the win. Zach Greinke allowed one run on four hits over eight innings for the Dodgers to earn the National League ERA title. His offense helped with a Justin Turner solo home run in the first inning and an Adrian Gonzalez RBI ground out in the fourth to give them a 2-0 lead. The Padres cut the Dodgers lead in half in the fifth when Austin Hedges hit his third home run of the season making it 2-1 L.A. But they couldnâ€™t capitalize in the ninth. Jedd Gyorko singled and Kenley Jansen hit Brett Wallace to put the go-ahead run on, but Alexi Amarista and Hedges both had fly outs to preserve the Dodgers win. With the New York Mets getting swept by the Nationals in a doubleheader, L.A. is ensured home field advantage for the Division Series. Frank Garces (0-0, 5.00 ERA) is on the mound to prevent the sweep for the Padres tomorrow against Clayton Kershaw (16-7, 2.16 ERA).
