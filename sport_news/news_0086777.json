Delhi declared their seconds innings at 437/9. By stumps, the hosts lost their opener Pranay Sharma early. They will resume the final day needing another 316.\nYoung Nathu used the new ball, taken soon after lunch, well to put Delhi on the back foot. Having dismissed skipper Gautam Gambhir (93) and Pradeep Sangwan in the morning session, Nathu picked up another four wickets to reduce the visitors to 291 for seven. That was when Narwal stepped in and handed the initiative back to Delhi. He struck five sixes and 10 boundaries in his blazing innings.\nAshok Menaria's will have to survive an entire day on a deteriorating wicket. As things stand, the hosts would be happy with a draw, having gained the first innings' lead. Overnight batsman Gambhir could not build on his innings as he struggled to get through the nervous 90s. Nathu pacer did the early-morning damage as he trapped Gambhir in front of the stumps.\nGambhir started the day hammering Aniket Choudhary for back-to-back boundaries. He gave the small crowd something to cheer about with some of his trademark shots. His innings was studded with 11 boundaries.\nThe skipper lost his overnight partner Sangwan early when he was caught by Ankit Lamba at short-leg off Nathu. Nathu, in fact, claimed the first seven wickets. Despite losing two early wickets, Delhi consolidated. Menaria started ringing in the changes searching for breakthroughs.\nRanji Trophy: Round 1, Day 3\nGroup A : Karnataka 187 and 3948 decl (R Samarth 131, S Puryastha 3-78). Assam 194 and 301.
