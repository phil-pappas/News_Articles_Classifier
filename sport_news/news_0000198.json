At worst, it looked like just another paper-shuffling office, and a small one at that. At best, the new office promised to make it a little bit easier for small businesses to navigate state rules and regulations.\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms\nRead more about the editorial board's priorities for Oregon.\nBut sometimes small investments can produce significant returns, and that is happening with the Office of Small Business Assistance . On Monday, Ruth Miles, the state's small business advocate and leader of the new office, gave the House Interim Committee on Business and Labor a review of the office's operations. The numbers she cited were modest: The office opened 140 cases in 2014, and provided simpler \"one-and-done\" advice to many more businesses. However, the real payoff comes from what Miles and her one-person staff have learned while helping those small businesses. She made several points in her presentation that government agencies and business across the state should apply to their operations.\nSolve problems before they happen. Miles has emphasized outreach to small businesses, in part through public appearances and in part by working closely with small business development centers around the state. She noted, correctly, that individual government agencies could improve their services to businesses with an increased emphasis on outreach.\nState agencies can reduce paperwork and still meet their goals. If the state is going to create new rules and regulations for small businesses – and there certainly seems to be an inclination to do that these days – it should implement the laws in the least burdensome way possible.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

Miles didn't offer any assessment of the value of new regulations in her testimony, but she did offer an example of how to improve implementation. In particular she cited a case involving the Oregon Department of Transportation. House Bill 2435, passed in 2013, forgave the state fuel tax on retail sales of B20 biodiesel to some nonfarm vehicles. The paperwork required by ODOT became burdensome because sales far exceeded expectations, she said. She brought the problem to the transportation department's attention, and within three months it consulted with retailers and made changes to its reporting system that resolved the problem.\nBusinesses need to be part of the solution. That example leads to another piece of advice: \"By including their fuel sellers in creating a solution to this problem, ODOT widened their brain trust,\" Miles said. Neither legislators nor agency employees will be able to anticipate all problems. That's understandable, but frustration can be avoided if they listen to businesses and seek advice when those inevitable problems arise.\nEmphasize communications. Speaking of listening, Miles said 100 percent of the problems that come to her office can be traced to poor communications, \"usually on both sides of the equation.\" She then offered advice that should be put on a laminated card and sent to every government agency in the state: \"Agency communication can't just be about putting information on a website and hoping that business owners intuitively understand how they fit into a complex system of regulation.\" In fact, more than a few businesses also over-rely on websites to communicate with customers.\nIn any given year, the Office of Small Business Assistance will provide direct help to a relatively small number of businesses. The number grows when you add those that benefit from advice given by Miles and others in public appearances. But the real payoff will come if state agencies listen to the feedback that Miles' office funnels back to them and use it to streamline and tailor operations in ways that better serve Oregon small businesses.\n--The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://sos.oregon.gov/business/Pages/office-small-business-assistance.aspx", "https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2015I1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/80351", "https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/senatedemocrats/Documents/senmaj062813.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-01T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:25:19.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
