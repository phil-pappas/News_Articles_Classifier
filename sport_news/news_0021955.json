Remember that?\nPlayboy's sensible and almost certainly overdue move to cover up what's between its covers, beginning with its March 2016 issue, is less out of modesty than having been humbled.\nAs a pure media story, the acquisition announced Tuesday of 20-year-old Chicago-based Pitchfork Media, known for its independent music site, quarterly magazine and music festivals, by Conde Nast, publisher of the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Wired and GQ, might well be a bigger deal.\nBut the move by Chicago-born Playboy signals the end of an era spanning decades, albeit an era that probably ended some time ago, rolled over and fell asleep.\nPitchfork has been and will continue to be relevant in ways 62-year-old Playboy magazine, which has its own famous music festival, has long struggled either to retain or regain. Its airbrushed and soft-focus sexuality, no longer cutting edge, simply isn't cutting it.\nPlayboy's models are getting clothes because the magazine is no longer hot.\nCreated from Esquire defector Hugh Hefner's vision of how to advance the men's magazine genre to reflect a changing society, once-revolutionary and once-dominant Playboy must circle back in hopes of challenging Esquire and other publications divvying up the lifestyle realm.\nCandace Jordan: Say it ain't so, Hef Open link Think Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue-level raciness. Probably not suitable for high school libraries, but not necessarily consigned to a back shelf and opaque plastic bag at 7-Eleven either.\nPlayboy has always offered lifestyle, literature, fashion and news content, and then some. It is part and parcel to the fantasy Hefner has always sold and still hopes to embody, even at age 89, that of being the coolest, sharpest, most irresistible cat in any room.\nThe socially redeeming material often was so overshadowed that the phrase \"I only buy Playboy for the articles\" has always been good for a smile, even when contributors included people named Kerouac, Nabokov, Capote, Atwood, Mailer, Vonnegut, Heller, Bradbury, Clarke, McLuhan, Ginsberg, Styron and Updike.\nYet if you stumbled across a reference to Playboy at all lately, it likely was for the articles. No joke. The media ecosystem of 2015 prizes proprietary original content. What's common is taken for granted and often for free, and sex and nudity are everywhere.\nPlayboy To Stop Running Nude Photos Playboy is about to find out how many people really do read it for the articles. The magazine has announced that it will no longer run photos of completely naked women. (Oct. 13) Playboy is about to find out how many people really do read it for the articles. The magazine has announced that it will no longer run photos of completely naked women. (Oct. 13) See more videos What's telling is you're still more likely to hear talk about what Jimmy Carter said about having lust in his heart in his November 1976 Playboy interview than Dick Cheney calling Barack Obama the worst president in his lifetime in his interview in last April's issue.\nFrankly, the Playboy brand is more relevant than the once influential magazine that spawned it, and the bunny logo is more exposed than the publication or anything in its pages. More vibrant too. Definitely more profitable.\nLicensing of the Playboy bunny and brand for everything from liquor, jewelry and bath products to clothing, clubs and international editions of the magazine around the world is the company's moneymaker.\nThe U.S. edition of its magazine — its circulation of around 800,000 a small fraction of its long-ago peak — bleeds about $3 million a year and continues to exist primarily to promote the brand that enjoys increasingly independent mainstream identity.\nNot only are the naked images that once boosted Playboy no longer a great asset — the age of its website's visitors has dropped by more than a third to 30 and traffic increased fourfold since the models got clothed — they may in fact undermine the brand.\nThere are places all over the world where Playboy products are restricted because of their tangential link to the magazine's sexual content.\nDon't underestimate Hefner's continued editorial influence for keeping the company from abandoning its U.S. print edition altogether rather than invest in this latest revamp.\nFeminists have argued that Playboy depictions and attitudes demean women, and the personal life Hefner projects may strike some as more libertine than simply liberated. But he has always contended that he favors old-fashioned romance and a bit of mystery over overt sexuality. He may have been an easier sell on the cover-up than might be imagined.\nHefner was famously upset 40-some years ago by a pictorial in Penthouse magazine that he viewed as punch below the belt by rival Bob Guccione, opening up new territory for the industry.\n\"That's not photography,\" Hefner reportedly said at the time. \"That's pornography.\"\nHefner nonetheless soon followed suit. The hairline fracture in what was considered acceptable only expanded as others pushed, amplified by new technology that upended old media hierarchies. The dam ultimately burst, flooding the mainstream.\nThat's the world in which Playboy now treads water, the one that finds it putting its models in bikinis, lingerie, a towel, a robe, whatever.\nTrying to lure marketers in its heyday, 1960s Playboy ads used to ask \"What sort of man reads Playboy?\" and offer an avatar of a happening, well-groomed, well-to-do, ambitious overachiever.\nWho knows who reads Playboy today? Circulation figures suggest plenty do. But if you find a reader, you might also ask why.\nMargin call: Cubs pitcher Orval Overall struck out four Tigers in the bottom of the first (one of the batters reached base on a wild pitch) en route to a three-hit Game 5 shutout of Detroit 107 years ago Wednesday, securing a second successive World Series championship.
