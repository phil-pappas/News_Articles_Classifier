They've booked next week, too, with an option for a couple more.\nPlayoff baseball at the Globe.\nWho saw this coming?\nNot you or me, pal.\nWhen Yu Darvish blew out his elbow in spring training, I told Jeff Banister it meant no more fun columns out of Surprise, which was like telling the pope you gave up church because it was too hard on your knees.\n\"Wait a minute,\" Banister said, glaring. \"There are a lot of good things to write about.\"\nPrince Fielder was healthy and happy for a change. Mitch Moreland was having a great spring.\nShin-Soo Choo couldn't underperform forever, right?\n\"Contrary to what might seem likely coming off a 67-win season,\" I wrote on March 9, \"the Rangers have the makings of a pretty good team. Enough to be a wild-card contender and make Banister a candidate for manager of the year in the process.\"\nAnd then Derek Holland went down, too, and I wrote 'em off.\nThey were easy to dismiss on any number of occasions this season as they yo-yoed up and down the standings.\nNine-and-a-half games out on May 3.\nOne-and-a-half out on June 13.\nNine out on July 20.\nFrankly, following the Rangers was enough to give you vertigo. Not long into the ride, you came to the conclusion the thrill of the climb wasn't worth the despair of the dives. Better to simply assume it wouldn't work out, just like last year. Easier to say it wasn't the 2,281 days the Rangers spent on the disabled list last season that sunk them, it was the Curse of Nolan, the Curse of Daniels, the curse of 40-something years wandering around baseball's wilderness, and this year was just more of the same.\nMeanwhile, Banister ran his first major league club with the head of a geek and heart of a high school football coach. The man has an aphorism for every occasion. Also pragmatic enough to get Fielder and Adrian Beltre to buy in and let them do most of the heavy lifting in the clubhouse.\nBanister couldn't sit back and wait on his veterans, as was Ron Washington's habit. Washington could afford to wait because of the depth from lead-off through seven. Banister's not afraid to run against the grain, either. His left-leaning lineup couldn't hit lefties. So he handed Mike Napoli an outfielder's glove and stuck him out in left field.\nProbably should have given him a helmet, too, but let's not nitpick. Not only did Napoli survive the experiment, the Rangers' record against southpaws improved dramatically.\nOf course, he had Napoli as an unlikely option because Jon Daniels picked him up from Boston for $1.5 million on Aug. 7. The Rangers were 51/2 games out at the time. Acquiring Napoli was a nice, low-cost move, roughly on par with most of the moves he's made this year.\nDaniels got Arte Moreno to pick up the tab on Josh Hamilton. Bobby Wilson was a waiver claim, Drew Stubbs a free agent.\nAll have made a direct impact on getting the Rangers where they now find themselves. Wilson and Chris Gimenez held the catching position together while Robinson Chirinos and Carlos Corporan were out.\nJust this week, both Stubbs and Hamilton made game-saving catches to put the Rangers in position to clinch.\nGet this: Choo made a spectacular catch Friday on a slicing liner off Mike Trout's bat. The same Choo who, on July 11, played a ball into a triple in right field, leading me to write that he \"consistently wears the expression of a man trying to remember where he left his car keys.\"\nReeking of self-doubt, king of the check swing, Choo was hitting .224 at the time.\nAnd after counseling from his wife at the All-Star break? His .457 OBP ever since is far and away the best in the league.\nDaniels also proved pretty adept in big-ticket deals, too. In the Cole Hamels trade, he got Jake Diekman. Combined with Sam Dyson, who cost him Tomas Telis, Daniels acquired three pivotal pitchers to both strengthen and lengthen the rotation and repair the back end of the bullpen.\nSince those deadline deals, the Rangers have gone from a lousy bullpen to a championship-caliber one.\nYou simply couldn't have seen this coming last spring. Especially if you were me sitting across a desk from Daniels in Surprise, telling him he had to deal for Hamels, and getting a reaction that said, \"Yeah, right.\"\nThat's a pretty good poker face Daniels has. Pretty good team he's built, as well. They could be going places after all. Like deep into October.\nRANGERS RETURN TO THE POSTSEASON\nThe Rangers are back in the postseason as the AL West Champs.\nThe Texas Rangers will play the No. 2 seed -- the Toronto Blue Jays Â -- in the playoffs.\nFULL PLAYOFF SCHEDULE HERE\nÂ\nLatest news Â Rangers GM Jon Daniels has grown from youngest in his job to one of longest tenured\nRangers employee fired after posting 'Fire Charlie' tweet during Longhorns' blowout loss\nElvis Andrus makes final out of Rangers' loss by over-sliding second base\nRougned Odor apologizes to Los Angeles Angels for late, spikes-up slide\nAnalysis Sherrington: The curse of Nolan is over!
