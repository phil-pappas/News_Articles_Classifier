If all the new pieces fit well, the B’s could be pretty good – maybe even very good.\nIf not? Well, getting a playoff berth in the fast-improving Eastern Conference could prove very challenging.\nThe Bruins had a day of team-building exercises Monday, then have two days of fine-tuning before the Jets come to town for Game 1. The B’s have to submit their 23-man roster by 5 p.m. Tuesday.\nYoung B’s winger Brett Connolly knows that is he one of the unknown variables who could play a key role in making or breaking the Bruins. He wouldn’t have it any other way.\n“It’s exciting,” said Connolly the other day. “They’ve put a lot of faith in me to be a go-to guy. I plan to embrace that. We’re going to need a lot of people to step up. Obviously, we have lot of new guys. A lot of players are going to have to step up and play well.”\nThe Bruins had been known for years for their stable lineup. But this year Garden fans have to get to know, along with Connolly – who played just five games late last season for the B’s – forwards Matt Beleskey, Jimmy Hayes, Zac Renaldo, Tyler Randell and Joonas Kemppainen, defensemen Matt Irwin, Colin Miller and returnees Joe Morrow (15 games) and Zach Trotman (27 games), and backup goalie Jonas Gustavsson.\nThe Bruins made their final cuts Monday, waiving veteran forward Max Talbot and goalie Jeremy Smith. The somewhat unexpected departure of Talbot, who was acquired from Colorado last season for Jordon Caron and a pick, presumably means Randell has made the team.\nTalbot, 31, was a classy presence and leader, but had just 0-3—3 and minus-3 in 18 games with the B’s. He should land with a new team. The B’s will save about $900,000 in cap value, $600,000 of which would go to Randell.\nNow, if all these new guys work out well – also assuming, of course, that the veteran core of the team performs up to par – the Bruins should be fine.\n“Exactly, exactly, and that’s exciting,” said Connolly. “With the young guys coming up and other guys who maybe aren’t quite as established as the older guys, and the new (veteran) guys coming into the city of Boston, there are a lot of players who can make a difference. If we can all buy into that, we can be where we want to be at the end of the year.”\nThe 23-year-old Connolly is certainly one of the guys who seems capable of making a big difference. He must demonstrate that his production in Tampa last season (12-3—15 in 50 games) before being dealt to Boston March 1 was a harbinger of big things to come for the 2010 No. 6-overall pick.\nIf the 6-foot-2 right-winger can click with linemates Ryan Spooner and Hayes, it could be a quite a productive threesome.\n“It’s a good opportunity for myself,” said Connolly. “I’m going to get an opportunity that I haven’t gotten the last few years. I’m excited for the challenge, to be put in some different situations and play with some good players. I’m very excited to get it going.”\nLast season, of course, did not finish well for Connolly, who broke a finger in practice shortly after arriving in Boston, sitting out 15 games before returning for the final five games of the season.\n“It was tough,” he said. “We had such a good team in Tampa at the start. I was scoring a little bit. But you know, you start to find your game and then you get traded. Then you get hurt.\n“So, yeah, it was a tough year. I’m looking forward to this year obviously, hoping to stay healthy and be a good contributor.”\nHe was confident enough in his ability to play this year on a modest one-year, $1.025 million contract – with the expectation of greater riches in his next pact.\n“I wanted a one-year deal,” said Connolly. “Not only to people around me but also to myself, this is going to be a good opportunity to prove that I belong here. It’s a good challenge and I’m looking forward to it.”\nMany other players, and the Bruins as a team, have the same sort of challenge: To prove that the optimists were right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:35:03.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
