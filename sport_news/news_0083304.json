Both teams were undefeated, Beacon at 6-0 having outscored opponents 30-1. \nMillsboro was on the rise at 5-0 with a 25-1 advantage over opponents in goals scored. \nThe game attracted a crowd most high schools never see for afternoon weekday games. The game was a Sussex County style happening. \nBeacon emerged victorious, 1-0, which doesn’t sound exciting unless you have blood in the game and realize that every hit and possession were crucial in an evenly played contest. \nThe freshly cut grass field was undulating and the ball rolled slowly. Beacon put on the pressure in the first half when defender Ryleigh Elliot cranked a high shot from up top off a corner that went “boom” for a huge 1-0 lead heading into halftime. \nThe second half was all about protecting the house for Beacon, and defender Anna Stancofski was all about it, slowing down drives and making stops throughout the second half. \nMillsboro put the ball on the Beacon front porch several times in the second half, but couldn’t get through the front door. \nBeacon goalies Autumn Davis and Marlee Geppert shared in the shutout victory. \nBeacon has four games remaining including a season-ending contest Wednesday, Nov. 4, versus Mariner at Champions Stadium.
