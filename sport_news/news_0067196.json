Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said at a news conference near MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford. \nMenendez and U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6 th Dist.) asked the Federal Trade Commission in a letter last week whether the agency had authority to regulate daily fantasy sports and if so, to begin setting rules to govern them. Congress exempted fantasy sports from 2006 legislation banning online gaming. RELATED : Feds should set rules for fantasy sports, N.J. lawmakers say \nCongress may have to re-examine that exemption, Menendez said. \nThe two wrote to the FTC after reports that employees of the two largest daily fantasy sports sites, FanDuel and DraftKings, used inside information to enter each other's contests. Menendez compared it to insider trading. \n\"Using insider information to game the system is cheating, plain and simple,\" he said. \nPallone said fantasy sports players had few protections compared to the gambling that goes on at casinos or racetracks. \n\"If a consumer goes to the racetrack and makes a bet, that's a highly regulated bet,\" he said. \"They have the confidence of knowing the racing commission or the state is watching what's going on.\" \nMenendez declined to go into detail on what regulations online fantasy sports sites should have to follow. \n\"Congressman Pallone and I want to create a system which, if you choose to play, you're going to be treated fairly and the deck hasn't been stacked against you.\" Myles Ma may be reached at mma@njadvancemedia.com .
