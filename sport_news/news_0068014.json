Martin Luther King Jr.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported exclusively Sunday morning a plan by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association and others to build a tower celebrating the line in King’s “I Have a Dream” speech declaring “let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.” Also in the works is a permanent exhibit on African-American soldiers in the Civil War.\nThe monument and exhibit are responses to a renewed debate over government-sponsored Confederate displays in the wake of the June killings of nine African-American churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., allegedly by a young white male who hoped to spark a race war.\nThe Rev. Joseph Lowery, who worked with King, said Sunday he was moved by the idea of honoring his colleague atop what is now Georgia’s most visited tourist attraction.\n“It is amazing,” Lowery said. “I think it is a good idea, introducing a new era to the Deep South. They are placing Martin Luther King in a place where he ought to be. Where I never dreamed he would be. This is striking.”\nBut Tim Pilgrim, head of the Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Vetetans, called the plans an “insult.”\n“This is an insult to us,” Pilgrim said. “This is like the government going down to Auburn Avenue and putting a monument of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackcon on top of the ML King monument. How would supporters of Martin Luther King feel about that?”\n—Please return to AJC.com for updates.", "external_links": ["http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/a-monument-to-mlk-will-crown-stone-mountain/nnyw2/"], "published": "2015-10-11T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:50:22.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
