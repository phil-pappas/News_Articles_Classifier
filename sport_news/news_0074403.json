Several frontcourt contributors have missed at least one game and the ball-handling trio of Marcus Smart, Isaiah Thomas and Evan Turner has yet to suit up together for a contest. \nAinge said getting players to buy into team depth \"is not an easy task for Brad.\" \nPressed on the subject, Ainge replied: \"I think the players are very smart and they all understand it. Before it even had to be brought up by myself or by Brad, the players get it. They know and they have great respect for the guys in the locker room. At our (Shamrock) Gala the other night it was brought up. Scal (Brian Scalabrine) asked them the question and four or five guys were -- they already know the depth of our team. They know that's the strength of our team. They know that one night they may play 30 (minutes) and the next night they may play 10. Hopefully over the course of a long season that can be our advantage.\" \nAinge said he isn't sure whether 51 wins -- which one ESPN model recently predicted -- is too high of a goal. \n\"I don't know. Our team, we don't have a lot of room for error,\" he said. \"I feel like we're a team that can beat anybody on any given night, and so consistency is going to be a big issue. Having our players buy in to the depth that is the strength of our team is not an easy task for Brad, and I think that there's a lot of questions to still be answered about our team. But I'm really excited about them, and really excited about our training camp and our practices and our preparation. I can't wait for the season to start.\" \nAinge also discussed Isaiah Thomas' role, Jared Sullinger's shape and the Toronto Blue Jays.
