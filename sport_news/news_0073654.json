For the Cyclones to win they’ll need most of the stats to go this way moving forward. \nISU held a sizeable edge in yards and yards per play. They were the more explosive team (holding Kansas to single-digit explosive plays is impressive regardless of the opponent). A success rate of 50.0 is very good. (Again for those that need it: success rate measures a team’s ability to consistently gain yards on each down to help it move the chains). \nA 10-yard advantage in average field position can’t be overlooked. Neither can ISU consistently getting into Kansas territory. The Cyclones got inside the Jayhawk 40 on 46.7 percent of their possessions. It’s hard to score without getting near the red zone. All of these factors are important in winning games. \nISU should want to see more touchdowns when getting inside the 40. I’ve yet to find a team that’s thrilled with a missed field goal and two turnovers when close to scoring. Or one that enjoys losing the turnover battle. \nNo, this game wasn’t perfect. But it’s a good blueprint for what must happen for future Big 12 success.
