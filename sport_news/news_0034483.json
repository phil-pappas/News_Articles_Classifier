So coming out of there with zero goals against was a team expectation, and we followed through with that tonight.\"\nUnion head coach Rick Bennett was pleased with the play of his freshman goaltender.\n\"That was a breath of fresh air. To see Jake go in there in his first game is pretty rewarding,\" Bennett said. \"You just never know. I guess the old crystal ball was working, and tonight it worked out well for us.\"\nMore Information\nUnion 2, Maine 0\nMaine 0 0 0 — 0\nUnion 0 0 2 — 2\nFirst Period – No scoring.

A minute later, he flashed his left pad to deny Brady Campbell to keep the game scoreless.\nUnion (2-0-2) finally broke the ice when defenseman Sebastian Gingras ' shot from the right point through a screen beat Morris at 5:26 of the third period.\nFreshman Brendan Thomas provided the chaos in front of the Maine goaltender, allowing Gingras' shot to find the back of the net.\n\"At this level, you've got to have guys in front of the net if you want to score goals,\" Gingras said. \"I think it was Taylor there, he goes to the net and gave him a great screen. Otherwise, that shot probably doesn't go in on good goalies like that.\"\nGingras' goal withstood an official's review, as Taylor had made contact with Morris's stick. But it was ruled a goal due to Morris's stick being out of the crease.\nUnion kept up the pressure on Maine (0-1-3) and made it 2-0 when Mike Vecchione ripped a wrist shot by Morris with five minutes to play for his first goal of the season.\nThe play was started by Gingras and finished by the Dutchmen co-captain.\nVecchione skated into the right circle flanked by a pair of Black Bear defensemen.\n\"I had a full head of steam,\" he said. \"I came from our d-zone all the way down. I was going down on a one-on-two and I knew I probably wasn't going to beat both guys. As soon as the D moved over, I just ripped it.\"\nSean Martin , a local freelance writer, is a frequent contributor to the Times Union .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:33:32.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
