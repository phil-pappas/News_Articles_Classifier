(W)e kind of take pride in that and we challenged them. They have responded every time this year.” \nAround the area, Winchester visits Centerville, Hagerstown visits Lincoln, Union County is at Tri, Eaton is at Bellbrook and National Trail at Bethel. \nA Winchester win, paired with a Northeastern loss, could force a tie for the second time in three years. \n“Once we lost control of our own destiny, it’s one of those things you don’t even talk about,” Winchester coach Mike Jones said. “It’s been a motivating factor, it’s made us get better and I think in the long run we’re probably a better team because of it. ... We know it’s senior night for Centerville.” \nTEC STANDINGS \nNortheastern 6-0 TEC, 6-2 overall \nWinchester 5-1, 6-2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:07:44.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
