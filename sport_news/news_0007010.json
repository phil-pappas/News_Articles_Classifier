All his toil, sacrifices, blood and sweat that have gone into the preparations for his debut professional bout would be put through a strenuous test when the three-time Olympian from Haryana walks into the Manchester Arena tomorrow to begin his much-awaited pro boxing career with a bout against Britain’s Sonny Whiting. It has been an eventful four weeks for Vijender since landing in Manchester on September 8. The 29-year-old from Bhiwani has spent a majority of his time at the Francis Warren-owned boxing academy, training under the watchful eyes of globally-renowned trainer Lee Beard. His days here have had a packed schedule, starting with rigorous sparring sessions, long hours in the gym, and outdoor activities such as swimming and running. In between, Vijender would shuttle between TV studios and magazine offices for interviews and promotional shoots. His fight night is titled ‘World War-III’. “Everything is different from amateur boxing. I start my training around 10 am, but I don’t know when it will end. This includes 8-10 hours at the academy and gym, with running around the city on fixed days. It’s unlike how I used to train with the Indian squad at the NIS centre in Patiala,” Vijender told The Tribune. “As my first fight week approached, Lee put me under intense sparring sessions, which included working on body attacks and making my punches more effective. Lee wouldn’t let me go until I got my punches and foot movement right. He is also working on my mental strength.” “Pro boxing is not all about physicality; it has got a lot to do with mind. You have to be one step ahead of your opponent mentally to gauge his next move. Quick body movement and accurate punches are the primary requirements, but half of the battle is won in the mind,” said the strapping six-footer. Vijender informed that Lee, who has trained pro stars like Ricky Hatton and Floyd Mayweather Sr., had put him through sparring sessions with a couple of WBO champions for the last one week. “My fight will comprise four rounds (as opposed to three in amateur boxing), so it’s important to think like a pro boxer. I have been training alongside Jack Catteral and Jimmy Kelly. Their knowledge of pro boxing is definitely helping me a lot,” he said. By his own admission, Vijender has been living out of the suitcase. His life is more fast-paced and different from his amateur boxing days in Patiala, where he would have the Indian boxing squad for company. “Here, it’s very different. I sometimes feel homesick as there isn’t any Indian boxer to talk to. After returning to my apartment, I don’t have anyone to interact with. It’s all very hectic out here with long training sessions from morning to evening, coupled with a series of promotional engagements. But I am thoroughly enjoying this part of my life. There’s a lot of fun and excitement involved apart from boxing,” he said. Vijender knows that the promotional part is very important to create a right kind of hype for the event, which has generated a lot of interest in Manchester and back home as well. Some tickets at the 21,000-capacity Manchester arena are costing around £400-500 each. Vijender has been getting a lot of calls from his fellow Indian amateur boxers and friends to know about the timing of his bout. Talking about his opponent, Whiting, who has already promised to put him “through hell”, Vijender said his punches would do the talking in the ring. Rochester-based Whiting has fought three bouts till date and has a 2-1 win-loss record. “He will hit me and I will hit him, but the end result would be in my favour. I will first study his movements and then unleash my punches. I always prefer to let my boxing do the talking. I am a man of action, not words,” Vijender cautioned his opponent. The fight night is already high on celebrity quotient as England’s most popular footballer Wayne Rooney and boxing sensation Floyd Mayweather Jr. are likely to attend some or all of the evening's bouts.
