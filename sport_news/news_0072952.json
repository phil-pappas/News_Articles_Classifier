Phillip) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Daniel Murphy hit his fifth playoff homer and rookie Noah Syndergaard outpitched Chicago Cubs ace Jake Arrieta, sending the New York Mets to a 4-1 victory Sunday night and a 2-0 lead in the NL Championship Series. \nMets outfielder Curtis Granderson robbed Chris Coghlan of a homer, stole two bases and scored twice. Murphy became the first player since Tampa Bay slugger Evan Longoria in 2008 to homer in four consecutive postseason games. \nThe best-of-seven series shifts to Wrigley Field on Tuesday night, with New York ace Jacob deGrom scheduled to pitch against Kyle Hendricks. The wild-card Cubs need a comeback to capture their first pennant in 70 years. \nArrieta gave up hits to his first three batters and was pulled after five innings — matching his shortest start of the year. \nSlumping star David Wright put the Mets in front with a hit-and-run double in the first. Murphy followed with a two-run shot. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:26:21.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
