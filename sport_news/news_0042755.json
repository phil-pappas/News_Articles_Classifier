LSU wide receivers aren't making plays, which is the topic of discussion with Atlanta radio host Chuck Oliver in this podcast.\nLSU wide receivers have dropped seven balls in the last two games against heavy underdogs Syracuse and Eastern Michigan. That forced the LSU offense to lean on running back Leonard Fournette and unbalance the offense. Coach Les Miles threatened to shuffle the deck on Monday .\nMiles said the wide receivers had a good week of practice but the proof will be in the pudding Saturday when the Tigers play their third SEC game against South Carolina in Tiger Stadium Saturday.\nScroll down, punch the audio file button and listen to the discussion.
