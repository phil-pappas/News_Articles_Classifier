Next year, the footprint for the same number of events will be 193 days. \nThe stretching was done by moving the St. Petersburg race forward two weeks and the Sonoma race back three weeks. In the case of St. Petersburg, Easter fell on the traditional date and the week prior to that was taken by the annual 12-hour sports car race at nearby Sebring International Raceway. Thus the adjustment. IndyCar close to completing ‘16 schedule \nThere will a single race in March, three in April, two in May, four in June, three in July, one in August and two in September. \nAt first glance, the last part of the schedule looks light, but the fluctuation of the world calendar put the race at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course on July 31; it traditionally has been the first weekend of August. \nAugust has just one race – a return to Pocono Raceway on Aug. 21 – but the combination of Mid-Ohio, Pocono and Boston gives IndyCar three events in a 50-day stretch. There’s a race (Mid-Ohio), two weekends off, the Pocono race, a week off, the Boston race, a weekend off, then the finale at Sonoma. \nIndyCar CEO Mark Miles said he “really likes” the pacing. \n“I think our teams and fans will, too,” he said. \nA pair of popular venues – Phoenix International Raceway and Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis. – are set to return while three others – Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, Calif., the Milwaukee Mile and NOLA Motorsports Park outside of New Orleans – will not. IndyCar last raced at Phoenix in 2005, at Road America in ’07. \nScheduled in between are, among others, the Indianapolis 500 and a new street race in Boston. They are as noteworthy for different reasons. \nThe 500 will be held for the 100th time, which is cause for celebration, and Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials are planning a big one. Details will be confirmed and then released once sponsorship is secured, Miles said. Mark Miles Q&A: Don’t expect a closed cockpit in IndyCar \nIn Boston, local organizers are trying to derail resistance from residents in the Seaport District along with concerns for the cost of preparing the circuit. \nMiles said IndyCar continues to be interested in returning to Gateway Motorsports Park just east of St. Louis, but there won't be a race there next year. IndyCar's last appearance was in 2003. The same is true for a late-February race in Mexico City. \nIn releasing the schedule, IndyCar will announce starting times and television pairings.
