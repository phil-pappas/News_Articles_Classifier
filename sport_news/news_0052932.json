He wrote two weeks ago to five-star recruit Rawle Alkins, and Alkins posted the letter on Twitter on Friday.\nPreston Carter, from Hustonville, Ky., said he was inspired after Kentucky’s loss to Wisconsin in the Final Four to “make sure that UK didn’t lose another opportunity to win a national title.” Over the summer, he looked up the top Kentucky prospects on a recruiting website, Googled the addresses of their schools, put the player’s name and the school’s name on the envelope and mailed them.\nAlkins’ letter came later after he transferred from Christ The King in New York to Word of God in North Carolina.\nAlkins’ tweet with the letter included the message, “UK fans are serious I Love it !”\nUK fans are serious I Love it ! pic.twitter.com/ZKVtzywTkC\n— Rawle Alkins (@Iam_RawleAlkins) October 23, 2015 The letter to Alkins is dated Oct. 13 and 7:07 p.m. and begins “Dear Rawle” with the word “King” written in above. He ended the letter with, “I hope to see you in a Kentucky uniform.”\nNext to his name at the bottom, Carter affixed a sticker with the UK logo.\nCarter’s reasoning for Alkins to come to UK was because of Calipari’s success with great guards and getting them to the NBA.\nCarter also got a response via Instagram from Sacha-Killeya Jones, a power forward from Chapel Hill, N.C., who committed to Kentucky in August.\nCarter has been a UK fan his entire life and his mom, Sandi, said he has been “playing basketball since he could grip a ball.” He just made his high school team this week.\n“I was a bit skeptical when he told me what he was doing, but he said he thought it would help the Big Blue Nation,” she said. “When he gets his mind set on something, I know better than to doubt and I guess he was right.”\nPreston said he really believed the players would see the letters.\n“Preston really does bleed blue,” Sandi said. ” He would love to meet Coach Cal one day.”", "external_links": ["https://t.co/ZKVtzywTkC", "https://twitter.com/Iam_RawleAlkins/status/657595992812994560"], "published": "2015-10-24T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:05:27.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
