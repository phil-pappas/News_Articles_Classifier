They began the final weekend of the season at 81-78 and eliminated from playoff contention, eight games behind the NL East champion Mets. \nThe Nats led the division for much of the year before a second-half slide that included a recent dugout fight between MVP candidate Bryce Harper and closer Jonathan Papelbon. \nThose struggles prompted speculation that Williams would be fired. He has declined to elaborate on his situation. \n\"I'm not going to subject this team to any more distractions,\" he said. \nWilliams was the NL Manager of the Year last season in his first year on the job. In February, the Nationals picked up the option on his contract for 2016. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T19:58:50.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
