One of those wins came on a 32-save effort in the B-Sens' 2015-16 season opening win. \nHis only goal allowed in that game came when a rogue puck deflected off his teammate Fredrik Claesson's skate. Other than that , Dreidger smothered everything the Devils sent his way. \nDreidger says in the offseason he worked on his reflexes and being quicker between the pipes. \nIt might be just one game but so far, so good. \n\"I think that's why keeping your eyes on the puck and tracking it well always results in good rebound control,\" Dreidger said after the game. \"So, that looked like it looked good but, then again, when your D do a good job on shots from the outside, it's pretty easy to do that.\" \nLuke Richardson said Dreidger is likely to be his first choice for the near-future in net, so that makes him a good bet to start Saturday at Syracuse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:42:04.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
