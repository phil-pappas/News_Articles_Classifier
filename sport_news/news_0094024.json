The match referee told me that rules specify that he will have to fine Manoj. Gautam Gambhir has been penalised 70 percent of his match fees. There is no further hearing and no match ban has been imposed on either of them,\" Bengal team manager Sameer Dasgupta told PTI today.\nDasgupta also informed that Tiwary did not have to personally appear for hearing as the match referee handed him the letter which contained the quantum of punishment.\n(Read: Gambhir and Tiwary speak up about Ranji fight )\nTouching an umpire is a grave offence in cricket, which could invite a ban. The two players were summoned for a hearing after the day's play by Match Referee Valmick Buch but the quantum of punishment, if any, will only be known tomorrow after the match ends. The incident happened in the eighth over when Partha Sarathi Bhattacharjee got out of Manan Sharma's bowling and Tiwary came in to bat at No. 4 wearing a cap.\nTiwary first took guard and was about to take strike. But he stopped the bowler and signalled at the dressing room to bring his helmet as a pacer was operating from the other end. The furore started with Gambhir saying: \"Shaam ko mil tujhe maroonga (Meet me in the evening, I will hit you). And Tiwary retorted, saying: \"Shaam kya abhi bahar chal (Why wait till evening, let's go out and settle it now\").\nUmpire Srinath then sprinted from the bowler's end. Gambhir, with his fists raised, charged towards Tiwary, who was also not ready to back down. Umpire Srinath came in the middle, but Gambhir to everyone's horror pushed the umpire trying to get him out of the way. Manan ticked off Manoj and he told him to lay off. All of a sudden, Gambhir, at first slip, got into the action and started abusing the Bengal skipper, who then retaliated.\n\"I have huge respect for Gautam Gambhir for whatever he has done for the country but today he crossed the limit with his comments. He made personal comments. I was really shocked as I did not start it at all. He is much senior to me and I respect him,\" Tiwary said in his defence. (Read: Shaam Ko Mill: When Gambhir almost came to blows )\n\"I had kept my helmet beside the boundary rope as it has become wet and I wanted to dry it. That was about it and everyone saw I was not the first one to react. He tried to hit but could not. He pushed the umpire who came in between. It's their in the video, you all have seen it.\"\nWith inputs from agencies", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:05:55.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
