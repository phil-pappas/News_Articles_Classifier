In light of the arrests and suspensions, losses and court dates related to the Rutgers football program, Eric LeGrand, the former defensive tackle who is working to walk again, acknowledged the need to attract positive attention to the program.\n“We definitely need some,” LeGrand said. “It’s been a rough time.”\nLeGrand will absorb all interest from fans Thursday. For the third consecutive year, an event hosted by two Rutgers season-ticket holders will be held at Fiddler’s Elbow Country Club in Bedminster, N.J. LeGrand and his mother, Karen, will be on hand, and tickets are going for $100 per person. The night will be 15 days before the five-year mark since LeGrand was paralyzed from the neck down while making a tackle for Rutgers in the Meadowlands.\nHe considers the dinner a special occasion for all involved.\n“I can’t thank them enough,” he said.\nRonald Garutti and Jason Newcomb, partners at Newroads Financial Group and Rutgers alumni, came up with the idea to honor LeGrand and attract attention to his ongoing fundraising three years back. In the first year, they raised $24,500. In year two, they took in more than $42,000. They pay every cent of the event’s costs so that all proceeds go directly to LeGrand’s foundation, which is called Team LeGrand of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation.\n“Our goal going in originally was to raise $5,000 or so,” said Garutti, who was in attendance at the game when LeGrand was paralyzed. “Eric’s a unique individual. He has really embraced his role.”\nLeGrand is scheduled to address the crowd Thursday night. One of his trainers, Buffy, will also be there to detail part of LeGrand’s physical efforts during therapy that he does multiple times per week.\nDonations came in from across the tri-state sports scene, both from locals and organizations. The Giants, Jets, Mets, Red Bulls and Red Sox all contributed items. The list of Rutgers individuals giving back includes former defensive backs Devin and Jason McCourty, wideout Tim Wright, tailback Brian Leonard and linebacker Khaseem Greene. Women’s World Cup star Carli Lloyd also contributed.\nA highlight of this year’s auction will be a Fenway Park experience. The winner will get four seats by the field and a private tour of the premises. An autographed Matt Harvey jersey will also elicit bids.\n“Almost instantaneously, upon mentioning Eric, people say, ‘Whatever you need. Let me know how I can help,’” Garutti said.\nGifts for LeGrand and his foundation continue to trickle in from across the country and overseas. Garutti noted one donation streamed in from Spain via Facebook. SNY’s Chris Carlin will serve as the emcee for the night.\nThere are reminders of LeGrand’s influence at Rutgers games, both at home and on the road. At the on-campus stadium in Piscataway, high above the playing field, his No. 52 stands alone.\nThere are also black and red T-shirts seen in the crowds at each contest. They have his number emblazoned across the front and back. There is also one word that appears. It says, simply, “BELIEVE.”\nRelated Stories LeGrand cheered at Rutgers commencement, inspires students Bondy: By insulting Eric LeGrand, Rutgers prez fumbles again After 'miscommunication', Eric LeGrand will speak at Rutgers' commencement Dog trains paralyzed football player Eric LeGrand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:37:00.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
