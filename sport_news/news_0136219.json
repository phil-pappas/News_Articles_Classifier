ESPN was scheduled to air the tournament next July to complete an eight-year contract, but NBC said Monday it had negotiated with the R&A and ESPN to take over in '16. The original agreement will still go through 2028. \nNBC and partner Golf Channel will now be able to use next year's British Open to promote its coverage later in the summer of golf's return to the Olympics. \nNBC lost its U.S. Open rights when the USGA agreed to a 12-year contract with Fox that started this past June. Its deal with the R&A also includes the Women's British Open.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:39:12.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
