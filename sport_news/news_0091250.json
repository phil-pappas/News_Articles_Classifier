Shelby took the opening possession of the second half inside the Redmen 5-yard line. Bellevue, however, held its ground and forced a turnover on downs, taking possession at the 19-yard line after a penalty on the Shelby sideline. \nThe Redmen marched down the field in eight plays and grew their lead to 36-6 on a 31-yard touchdown run by Bryce Ray. \n“I told my seniors I’m sorry because we were unable to get our No. 1 goal,” said Shelby coach Eric Will, whose team could have won at least a share of the league crown with a win. “I told our underclassmen, this is the gap. Bellevue has the league right now and they’re going to continue to have the league until someone takes it from them.” \nBELLEVUE HIGHLIGHTS \nThe Redmen moved the ball at will against the Whippets. Alec Foos and Bryce Ray combined for 185 rushing yards in the first half alone on their way to a 28-6 halftime lead. Foos ran for touchdowns of 8, 1 and 4 yards while also throwing a 13-yard touchdown pass to Seth Linder, who made a terrific catch in the end zone with 22 seconds remaining in the second quarter. The Redmen defense was outstanding after giving up a touchdown on the first Shelby possession of the game. Bellevue allowed Shelby just three first downs thereafter, one coming on a Whippet fake punt. Foos then added another touchdown run, from 2 yards out, midway throughout the fourth quarter for a 42-14 lead. \nRay finished the night with 216 yards while Foos rushed for 172. \nSHLEBY HIGHLIGHTS \nThe Whippets came out firing on offense, driving 65 yards on just six plays and 90 seconds, capped by a Devin Tuttle 23-yard pass from Brennan Armstrong. After that, however, the Whippets struggled as the Redmen defense made adjustments to slow the Whippets. Of Shelby’s 118 first-half yards, only 53 came after its opening possession. Shelby tried to generate momentum by running a fake punt on fourth-and-four. The Whippets converted the first down, but Bellevue forced a punt just three plays later. \nShelby’s offense improved in the third quarter, twice marching deep into Redmen territory, but scoring just once, on a 16-yard touchdown pass from Armstrong to Brandon Schneider on the final play of the third quarter, trimming the deficit to 36-14. \nShelby totaled 286 yards of offense led by Armstrong's 186 yards on 16-of-26 passing. 16 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1S1HLUy TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:01:15.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
