Fortunately, there are some decent options -- if you know where to look.\nSTUDS\nWR Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: The Washington Redskins are a mid-range matchup in fantasy, but they’ve allowed at least two wideout TDs in three of the past four weeks. Evans is set to turn around his mediocre sophomore season. Coming off a bye week, Evans had more time to rest his bothersome hamstring and work with rookie quarterback Jameis Winston. This could be your last chance to buy low.\nRB Lamar Miller, Miami Dolphins: Miami came out of the bye with a more aggressive approach on offense, focused on the run. Miller (113 yards, one score) showed the breakout talent pegged by his preseason hype. The Houston Texans were lucky to face a T.J. Yeldon-less Jacksonville backfield last week. Otherwise, they would be even easier than a top-10 fantasy matchup for running backs in point-per-reception games. Miller should keep his newfound momentum going.\nQB Andrew Luck, Indianapolis Colts: Luck’s three-touchdown return Sunday night signaled he’s back to elite territory. His shoulder doesn’t look like an issue anymore, and he looked efficient in making smart decisions. The New Orleans Saints have allowed the second-most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.\nRB Chris Ivory, New York Jets: The Jets would be smart to use their workhorse — suddenly one of the league’s best backs — as a way to keep Tom Brady’s offense off the field. Volume is key in finding the right fantasy players, and Ivory should log his fourth 20-plus-carry game of the year.\nTE Charles Clay, Buffalo Bills: With Sammy Watkins and Percy Harvin likely to stay on the sidelines, Clay will continue his target hogging (13 with nine receptions in two of the last three games). Teams with active tight ends have made the Jacksonville Jaguars pay lately.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 7 fantasy football rankings\nDUDS\nWR Jordan Matthews, Philadelphia Eagles: Matthews has at least five receptions in all but one of his games, and no fewer than seven targets in all six. Unfortunately, Carolina Panthers cornerback Josh Norman will be glad to take the playmaker out of Philly’s plans.\nRB Chris Johnson, Arizona Cardinals: For all the Baltimore Ravens' faults this year, they’re still stout against running backs who aren’t heavily involved in the passing game and/or stick mainly between the tackles. Baltimore is likelier to falter against reception-driven Andre Ellington or David Johnson than vs. the more plodding starter.\nRB Carlos Hyde, San Francisco 49ers: Though his injury appears to be a bruised foot and nothing more serious, Hyde will be hard-pressed to step up in a short week. The Seattle Seahawks allowed two scores to Carolina's Jonathan Stewart last week, but at less than 100% physical stability, Hyde won’t threaten that type of output.\nQB Matt Ryan, Atlanta Falcons: Hear us out. This might be a case of the ground attack taking over, the Falcons controlling the clock, and Ryan not having to do much. This isn’t a favorable week to use the middle tier of QBs, where Ryan falls.\nWR Brandin Cooks, New Orleans Saints: Besides his stellar Week 5, Cooks has failed to match his preseason hype. Though the Indianapolis Colts are a decent matchup for opposing passing games, Cooks probably will draw the steady Vontae Davis as a shadow, forcing Drew Brees to look elsewhere.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nFantasyScore podcast Week 7: Packers' cheesy backfield, Steelers offense, more\nSLEEPERS\nRB Latavius Murray, Oakland Raiders: A week of rest seems to have helped his shoulder. Great timing at the right price: He faces a San Diego Chargers defense that ranks second in points allowed per game to this position (point-per-reception formats). In the past two weeks, they’ve been gashed by Le'Veon Bell and, more pertinently, James Starks, who has a similar physique and style to Murray’s.\nRB Christine Michael, Dallas Cowboys: The former Seahawk has taken copious first-team reps in Dallas’ time off. The organization seems frustrated with Joseph Randle. A big (or at least increased) role from Michael, this week’s top waiver wire pickup, would play well against the New York Giants, a top-10 PPR running back matchup. Of course, this could be a confusing mix, but compared to Randle and Darren McFadden, Michael is the bargain of the group with the highest ceiling.\nQB Blake Bortles, Jacksonville Jaguars: Maybe this is the week the BUffalo Bills’ defensive front wakes up, but Bortles has worked around being sacked nine times to toss seven touchdowns in the past two weeks. Buffalo has given up two or more passing scores in five of its six games this year, and Bortles has rattled off 298 passing yards or more in his last three. Even if Allen Robinson plays hurt, Bortles will have plenty of receivers backing him up.\nWR Ted Ginn Jr., Carolina Panthers: Carolina’s passing game was dominated by tight end Greg Olsen last week, but expect the wideouts to be more involved. After all, the Philadelphia Eagles give up the third-most fantasy PPR points per game to the position. Ginn has averaged a career-high 17.2 yards per grab this year and should give Philly trouble in downfield spots.\nWR Robert Woods, Buffalo Bills: Sammy Watkins is doubtful to play in Week 7. Woods has at least five targets in three of his last four games and should see the biggest boost in value if Watkins has to sit. He’s at least in the picture regardless of which quarterback is starting. The Jaguars were torched by DeAndre Hopkins and Brian Hoyer last week. For pennies, you could land this week’s breakout from out of nowhere.", "external_links": ["http://fantasy.usatoday.com/2015/10/week7-fantasy-football-rankings-todd-gurley-philip-rivers", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6df8d0a1c3353d8f96bbcc9e3e8d57c1eeda7709/r=300/https/i0.wp.com/usatfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/fspodcast-site-hero660x4501.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebc9519ac086054fa5092ba711393606fbfe81d3/r=300/https/i1.wp.com/usatfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/todd-gurley-st-louis-rams_100415.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://fantasy.usatoday.com/2015/10/fantasyscore-podcast-week-7-packers-cheesy-backfield-steelers-offense-more"], "published": "2015-10-21T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:45:49.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
