Here’s what he had to say about Gary Andersen’s team.\nQuestion: Until last weekend’s game against Arizona, it appeared as if OSU was making small steps in the right direction every week. What explains the meltdown against the Wildcats?\nDanny Moran: Oregon State was expected to finish toward the bottom of the Pac-12 this season, but I was still caught off guard with how bad they looked last Saturday. The Beavers were coming off a bye week against a reeling Arizona team but looked completely overmatched on both sides of the ball. There really doesn’t appear to be any excuse as to why the team came out so flat and the coaching staff has echoed that notion. They don’t want excuses at this point. The offense was always going to be a work in progress but they improved against Stanford and Arizona had allowed 111 points in its previous two games. Defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake has simplified his scheme but the team is still blowing assignments. This is a big week to see if the new staff’s message is resonating.\nQuestion: How far has Seth Collins progressed since the start of the season? What’s the biggest reason behind his poor completion percentage? (50.4%)\nMost Read Stories Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman arrested for investigation of hit, run Mayor wants developer off project, cites violation of city values Outraged Seattle Public Schools parents, pace yourselves Police: Woman linked to 1973 disappearance is actually alive Seattle Seahawks release WR B.J. Daniels, RB Rod Smith Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Moran: Collins appeared to be progressing nicely in his first four games. He was never going to be the most accurate passer but used his athletic ability and mobility out of the pocket to win the starting job over redshirt freshman Marcus McMaryion. His completion percentage numbers remained steady against better defenses as his pass attempts increased and he threw only one interception. Saturday was by far Collins’ worst performance. He was 8 for 24 and threw a bad pick deep in his own territory. Collins can hit an impressive deep throw every now and then but still lacks consistent accuracy on midrange throws. This may be the biggest thing he needs to improve as his career progresses. Collins is a true freshman, though, so those growing pains are to be expected.\nQuestion: What ails the OSU defense? They seem to do well against the pass but struggle with the rush?\nMoran: The Beavers do not match up well with power run teams. They saw that against Michigan and Stanford and got worn down in each second half. Then they gave up 368 rushing yards against Arizona, their worst effort against an offense they should be better equipped to handle. The running defense has been the most consistent issue. But Oregon State’s passing defense did not get away unscathed in the past two games. The secondary has struggled with blown coverages and allowing deep plays, which were not problems in the first three weeks. There is a lot to get in order.\nQuestion: What is the most significant change Gary Andersen has made since he started at OSU?\nMoran: The most obvious thing he’s changed are the offensive and defensive schemes. Oregon State switched from a pro style offense to a spread and from a base 4-3 defense to a 3-4. He has also talked about changing the culture around the Beavers, a team that went 6-12 in Mike Riley’s final 18 games. It will be interesting to see how the team comes out following back-to-back losses. Will they come out fighting or will it be the start of another mid-season swoon?\nQuestion: What needs to happen for the Beavers to beat WSU this weekend?\nMoran: Avoiding turnovers deep in their own territory. Oregon State has given up one of those in each of its five games they have played. The Beavers are not going to outmatch anyone in the Pac-12 with talent so mistake-free football is key. They also cannot continue to get beat deep if Washington State tries them down the field. That may not the typical Cougars style, but why wouldn’t an effective passing team throw deep on Oregon State given their recent inability to stop those plays?\nFalk added to Manning Award watch list \nWashington State quarterback Luke Falk has been added to the Manning Award watch list, the Allstate Sugar Bowl announced on Wednesday. Falk, a redshirt sophomore, leads the Pac-12 in passing, with 392.8 yards per game, and has 15 touchdowns to two interceptions this season.\nThe Manning Award was created by the Allstate Sugar Bowl in honor of everything Archie, Peyton and Eli Manning have accomplished in college football. The winner will be selected by a voting panel — which includes national media and the Mannings — after the college football bowl season. Falk is one of 40 quarterbacks on the watch list.\nNow, some links: \n— I wrote about WSU safety Shalom Luani and how his international-level soccer experience has helped him become the dominant force he is in the Cougars’ secondary.\n— The WSU defense stayed late at practice Wednesday to ensure they finished all preparations for Oregon State .
