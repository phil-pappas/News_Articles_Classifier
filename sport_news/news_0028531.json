By Troy Hyde Newton Daily News \nCONRAD — Collins-Maxwell/Baxter’s volleyball team traveled to the BCLUW Tournament Saturday and returned home with an 0-4 mark. \nThe Raiders lost in straight sets to North Fayette Valley, host BCLUW and North Tama and was defeated in three sets by East Marshall. \n“It was a tough day for CMB volleyball,” CMB coach Scott Ranck said. “We did not play well. We played decent competition but competition we could beat. We just didn’t compete well and made too many errors.” \nNorth Fayette Valley defeated CMB 21-14, 22-20. The Raiders (10-12) were led by Kathleen Baldwin, who finished with four kills, eight assists and 13 digs. Bekah Pearson also had four kills. Payge Jurgens added three kills and Sailor Hinegardner collected 10 digs and was 14-of-16 in serves. \nBCLUW (23-8) cruised to a 21-14, 21-9 victory over CMB. Hinegardner had eight digs, Baldwin added eight assists. Jurgens, Pearson and Mikayla Eslinger each had two kills. \nNorth Tama had no trouble with the Raiders. The Redhawks downed CMB 21-10, 21-12. \nBaldwin had 10 assists and seven digs, while Eslinger, Jurgens and Jordynn Wesselink all had four kills. Hinegardner and Toni Spencer each had six digs. \nEast Marshall (8-17) needed three sets, but the Mustangs won 25-21, 18-25, 15-8. \nJurgens led the way with five kills and three aces. She was 13-for-13 in serves. Pearson had four kills. Mary Schabilion contributed three kills and five digs. Baldwin had a double-double with 12 assists and 16 digs. \nHinegardner finished with 10 digs, while Wesselink had 10 digs, two kills and two aces. The Raiders were 52-of-55 in serves with seven aces. \nBridget Hurley missed most of the day as she re-injured her shoulder when a ball from the other court hit her while she was on the bench. She played in the first set of the day but did not return. \n“We are still trying to figure out who our new self is, as well as our new roles, and continue to adjust and find the confidence needed to put the best team we can on the court,” Ranck said. \nCMB returns to action at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday when it heads to Alleman to face North Polk. That match is a Class 3A regional playoff preview.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:35:51.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
