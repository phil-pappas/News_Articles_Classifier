(Image Source: Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at the Sunday Night Football matchup between the Carolina Panthers and the Philadelphia Eagles: \nSeries: Eagles lead 6-2; Streaks: Eagles won 5 of past 6; Last Meeting: Eagles 45, Panthers 21 (11.10.14) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: NBC (Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth & Michelle Tafoya) \nSpread: Panthers -3; O/U 45’ \nInjury Report: Eagles: Out: WR Nelson Agholor (ankle), LB Kiko Alonso (knee); Questionable: DE Brandon Bair (groin), WR Riley Cooper (knee), LB Mychal Kendricks (hamstring), DeMeco Ryans (hamstring); Probable: WR Josh Huff (knee) \nPanthers : Out: TE Richie Brockel (hamstring), DT Dwan Edwards (ankle), LB Shaq Thompson (knee) OT Daryl Williams (knee); Probable: DE Jared Allen (back), LB A.J. Klein (concussion), CB Teddy Williams (concussion) \nWhere They Stand: With their win over the New York Giants on Monday Night Football, the 3-3 Philadelphia Eagles reached .500 for the first time this season and pulled into a first-place tie atop the NFC East. Among teams that are not at least two games over .500, Philly’s plus-34 is the best point differential in the NFL. In fact, it’s only seven points behind the 5-0 Carolina Panthers (plus-41), who are one of five remaining undefeated teams, one of two in the NFC. Three of the first-place Panthers’ five wins have come by seven points or less. The last time they started a season 5-0, Carolina went all the way to the Super Bowl in 2003. \nThe Eagles: In his career, QB Sam Bradford has had success against the Panthers, posting a 103.3 rating against Carolina in two starts. In six games this season, Bradford (9 TD passes, 9 INTs) has had a passer rating higher than 90 just once. When these two teams played last season leading WR Jordan Matthews caught seven passes for 138 yards and 2 TDs and WR Riley Cooper is coming off his best game of 2015, including a 43-yard reception and a 32-yard TD against the G-Men. A key to their victory was the breakout effort of RB DeMarco Murray , who rushed for 109 yards and a score on MNF, his best game as an Eagle. In his last meeting against the Panthers, RB Darren Sproles rushed for a TD and he scored on a PR, he’s just one of four players in league history to have multiple games with a PR and a rushing score. In last year’s win by the Eagles, the defense came through with a whopping nine sacks against Carolina, led by OLB Connor Barwin , who had 3.5. DE Fletcher Cox has recorded four sacks, three forced fumbles and a fumble recovery in the past two games, while CB Nolan Carroll turned in a pick-six last week. Playing safety this season, Walter Thurmond III has three INTs to lead the team. \nThe Panthers: Known more for his dual-threat ability QB Cam Newton has enjoyed throwing the ball against the Eagles in his career, going for 300 yards and two TDs through the air in both meetings. He has 27 games in his career with a TD pass and a TD run, the second most in NFL history and his only game with multiple rushing and passing scores came against Philly. Lacking ideal weapons on the perimeter, Newton’s primary target is TE Greg Olsen , who caught seven passes for 131 yards and a score last week. He’s one of three active TE’s with at least 5,000 receiving yards and 40-plus TDs since 2008. RB Jonathan Stewart is coming off a two-TD performance and he scored the last time they played Philly. All of Carolina’s top teams have had more playmakers on defense than offense and this bunch is no different. CB Josh Norman has intercepted an NFL best four passes this season, two of which he’s returned all the way to pay dirt. The heart and soul of their defense is their linebacking corps. Thomas Davis has recorded a team-high 44 tackles and he’s the only player in the league with at least two sacks and two-plus INTs. Luke Kuechly returned to the lineup last week and the tackling machine leads the NFL with 494 stops since he entered the league in 2012. \nPrediction: Truth be told, I’m not a huge fan of either one of these teams, although Newton and Carolina are growing on me. The Eagles first-place status is a product of playing in what is probably the weakest division in the conference, if not the NFL, while the Panthers opponents thus far have a combined record of 9-20. Yeah, no bueno. The difference so far seems to be Philadelphia needs their opponent to make mistakes to win, while Carolina is making winning plays. Couple that with home field and the edge at QB, and I have to go with the Panthers, even though I’m not exactly sure how they’re going to put up points. \nScore: Panthers 20, Eagles 16 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
