An own goal by Delhi’s Souvik Chakraborty (3rd minute) opened the scoring for the hosts before Reinaldo Da Cruz Oliveira (45’+2’) added the second at the stroke of half-time. The visitors, who had a better ball possession and scoring opportunities, failed to find the net as the rival goalkeeper making a couple of good saves. After being gifted with an early lead, the Zico-coached side continued to make the right moves even though the ground was a bit slippery due to a drizzle before the match. The home team had a chance to increase the lead in the 12th minute but Leonardo Moura’s low shot hit the post. Delhi, who lost both their matches to the home team last season, seemed unperturbed by the early setback and regrouped to create more chances. They had a chance to find the equaliser but the home team keeper Elinton Andrade did well to deny Richard Gadze in a one-to-one situation. The visitors kept on probing and earned another chance to find the equaliser but Florent Malouda’s header off a Vinicius Ferreira de Souza cross from the left went over the bar. Delhi, who seemed superior in the midfield, came up with a couple of threatening moves but to no avail. First, a Hans Mulder shot missed the target; later, Richard Gadze’s attempt was parried by the keeper for an abortive corner. The Goans, who played a waiting game, scored again in the injury time of the first half. Joffre Mateu Gonzalez, who was brought down just outside the box by defender Vinicius, took the free kick, which Reinaldo Oliveira deflected into the net to make it 2-0 at half-time. Delhi manager and marquee player Roberto Carlos brought himself on in the second half but he, too, couldn’t do much to change the result of the match. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:24:29.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
