He repeatedly told officers he was hiding from someone - but he had no idea his hiding place would have a woman with a Japanese sword.\n“I would have swung or I would have stabbed,” Dolley said of the fight that could have erupted.\nBut Wessel didn’t put up a fight, and he apologized on the way out.\n“If he would have behaved in a slightly different manner he would not have gotten out of here alive,” she said.\nCopyright 2015 WXIN via CNN.
