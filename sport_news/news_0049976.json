The Crimson Tide defeated the Catamounts 48-14. (Marvin Gentry-USA TODAY Sports) \nThe Las   sports department brings you the latest information on UNLV sporting news and events. By Adam HillLas   \nFormer Alabama running back Altee Tenpenny, who transferred to UNLV before the season only to be dismissed from the team before school began, died Tuesday in a car accident, according to several reports. \nHe was 20. The news was first reported by Luke Matheson of ArkansasVarsity.com. Several friends and former teammates shared prayers and remembrances on social media late Tuesday night. \nTenpenny, the top-rated recruit from the Arkansas in 2013 and a top 10 running back in the class nationally, rushed for 218 yards on 48 carries in two seasons at Alabama. He announced in May his intention to play for UNLV, but was kicked out of the program for an unspecified violation of team rules by coach Tony Sanchez in August. \nUNLV running back Keith Whitely posted a picture of Tenpenny on his Instagram page . \n\"R.I.P big bro, knew ya for a week, became family instantly, im gunna miss you Altee, still lost for words, can't believe it, just can't,\" the caption read. \nTenpenny, who had been attending Nicholls State and awaiting clearance to play football by the NCAA, was arrested on Sunday and charged with possession of a firearm and discharging a weapon. \nAccording to the Thibodaux (La.) Daily Comet, Nicholls State coach Tim Rebowe said Tuesday at his weekly news conference Tenpenny would no longer be a part of the program. \n\"I think he is pretty much done. I would have to check, but I understand he is resigning from the university and moving on,\" Rebowe said. \"It is unfortunate and I don't think he is a bad kid and we gave him an opportunity. He still wasn't cleared to play for us and he just had been practicing. He hadn't stepped on the field and I would've liked to see what he could do. We gave him an opportunity, but he has to straighten out his life. We wish him the best and we will still help him in any way we can.\" \nMatheson posted on Twitter he had been told Tenpenny was returning home to North Little Rock when the accident occurred. \nJust heard the news about Altee Tenpenny. My heart is broken. He was a tremendous young man. RIP Altee. Gone too soon.  Luke Matheson (@LukeMatheson) October 21, 2015 Altee had the biggest smile, you couldn't miss it.
