The executive committee is supposed to review its ideas before they go before a members' congress scheduled for February.\nCarrard gave no details of what his group was considering. It remains unclear if his panel will incorporate radical reforms proposed last month by Domenico Scala, the independent head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee.\nScala's radical overhaul plan, launched after seven soccer officials were arrested in Zurich in May on U.S. warrants, calls for 12-year term limits for elected FIFA officials, full disclosure of top officials' financial compensation, and more detailed integrity checks on members of committees.\nIt also includes replacing the powerful executive committee with a governing council elected by congress and a management committee to handle the day-to-day affairs of the organization.\nCarrard's group is made up of representatives of FIFA's six continental confederations -- the very ones who could see their powers reduced under Scala's reform plan.\nAsked what chances of success he saw for reforms at FIFA, Carrard said: \"I am cautious. As a lawyer I have won many trials I should have lost and sometimes lost what I should have won.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:54:12.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
