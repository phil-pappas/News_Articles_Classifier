Connor [Barwin] is here for three years, that front-seven with the exception of Jordan Hicks has been here for awhile. \n\"The fact that you have a player like Malcolm [Jenkins] who has kind of helped keep the back-end together and now Walter [Thurmond], Byron Maxwell and E.J. Biggers have started to all form a group back there in the secondary has also really helped. \n\"The one thing that Billy [Davis] has benefited from is that continuity that we have up front is we've had the same defensive line and those outside linebackers have played a ton of snaps for us. Really just the only addition at inside linebacker is Jordan Hicks who has exceeded some people's expectations, not ours, in terms of what he can handle as a rookie ... When you have some continuity from that standpoint, those guys understand the system to the point where you can make tweaks and you can make adjustments when the offense presents something. When the coaches are talking about adjustments, the players are finishing their sentences.\" \nDEMARCO MURRAY: Has Eagles' running back put slow start behind him? \nIn early season losses to the Atlanta Falcons, Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins, the lack of in-game adjustments was one of the loudest -- and most accurate -- criticisms both of Kelly, Davis and the rest of the coaching staff. However, it was a markedly different story in Monday's win over the Giants. \nAfter watching Eli Manning surgically move the Giants down the field on an eight-play, 80-yard scoring drive, the defense tightened. Those were the only seven points the Giants could muster all evening and DeMeco Ryans forced two turnovers and Carroll's interception seemed to inject life into the defense in the second quarter. \nThis defense is far from a finished product, but there is a certain swagger present with the group that had been missing early on. \n\"We believe we're the best team in the division,\" Byron Maxwell told NJ Advance Media following the game on Monday night. \"But, every week you have to go out there and prove it. So, we feel that way. We know this isn't our Super Bowl. We have to keep going.\" \nNext up is a clash with Cam Newton and the undefeated Carolina Panthers on Sunday night in Charlotte. If the past two games are any indication, it appears the Eagles' defense is up for the challenge of slowing one of the league's most dynamic quarterbacks, once again on a national stage. \nMatt Lombardo may be reached at MDLombardo@yahoo.com .
