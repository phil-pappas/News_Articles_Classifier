By Savannah Morning News Work crews with the Georgia Department of Transportation have finished a project to improve the intersection of U.S. 80, Pine Barren and Louisville roads in Pooler.\nBad weather forced GDOT to put off installation of new traffic signals until this week, but the goal was for immediate activation. The new lights are designed to provide extra time for drivers who need to turn left at the intersection.\nAs with any traffic signal, motorists should be cautious if they drive up to the new light during a malfunction. GDOT advises that a flashing yellow light requires drivers to yield to other vehicles and to pedestrians already in the intersection.\nA flashing red light should be treated as a stop sign. If the light is out completely, it should be treated as an all-way stop.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14791971.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14791968.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14791971.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14791970.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14791969.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14791968.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14791969.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14791970.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:22:30.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
