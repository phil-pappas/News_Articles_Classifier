I am fully focused on finishing the season strong and helping the New York Cosmos win the NASL Championship. In the coming months I will decide the next step in my career. \n\"Playing soccer has been part of my life for so long and the decision to retire is not an easy one but I believe it is the right time. \n\"I'm thankful to everyone who has supported me throughout my career and I look forward to playing my final games with the New York Cosmos over the coming weeks.\" \nRaul enjoyed a glittering career in his homeland, spending 16 years with Madrid during which time he won six La Liga and three Champions League titles. \nSpells with Schalke and Qatari-based Al-Sadd Sports Club then followed for Raul, who also scored 44 goals in 102 appearances for Spain. \nCosmos head coach, Giovanni Savarese, said: \"Raul is one of the world's most iconic players. I knew when we signed him what he would bring on pitch but his knowledge, passion, professionalism and commitment has exceeded my expectations. \n\"In less than a year, Raul has become a big part of the team and he will always remain part of the Cosmos family.\" \nThe Cosmos have already punched their ticket to the NASL post-season by finishing top of the standings in the spring season. They sit third in the fall season standings and top in the combined standings.
