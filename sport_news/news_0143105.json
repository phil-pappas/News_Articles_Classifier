(SVRR). The company, which operates the steam-powered historic railroad in Sumpter Valley, requested the transfer of land at its McEwen Depot, about five miles southeast of Sumpter, in March. At that time, public comments indicated positive support for the request, Baker County Parks Director Karen Spencer said. She said SVRR made the request in part because it would be more likely to obtain grants if it owns the land. Baker County and SVRR had a 25-year lease for the property. The railroad didn’t pay a lease fee. The county’s parks department has managed the property, which includes a day-use area and sewer lagoon. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality requires the sewer lagoon to be inspected on a weekly basis during the park’s operating season. The transfer will save the county money. “The parks department is trying to reduce financial obligation,” Spencer said. She said that since there is no financial gain from the lease with SVRR, she felt it was in the county’s best interest to recommend the land transfer to SVRR. If the railroad were to disband, the property would revert to the county. She said the county will retain the mineral rights to the land, and SVRR cannot sell the property. Another stipulation of the agreement to transfer the land is that SVRR cannot use the property as collateral for a loan. That ensures the county would not be responsible for any liens in case ownership reverts to the county. Heritage Museum Baker Heritage Museum Director Lea Hoover gave an update to the Commission. She said gift shop sales were up and admission numbers were down compared with last year. Hoover said Kids Camp had twice the normal participation and that the museum will focus more on educational programs in 2016. She said the central gallery’s military exhibit did very well this year and will continue to be the main exhibit next year. The current projects the museum is working on are the replacement of the Adler House roof and “Paint Your Wagon” 50-year anniversary in 2018. The museum closes for the season on Oct. 31. Baker County Fair Fair Manager Angie Turner gave the Commission an update on her department. “Our fair this year was a huge success,” she said. She said part of that success was because of a new door that was installed in the show barn, which allowed for much better animal and people flow through the barn. Grants to replace the door were provided by U.S. Bank, Soroptimists, Good Shepherds and the 4-H Association. Turner said in-kind sponsorships were up this year and totaled $8,979. Cash sponsorships were $11,145 for a total of $20,124 — up about $5,000 from last year. 151 animals were auctioned this year for a total of $192,595.33. Turner said the demolition derby was a huge success this year. Extra bleachers had to be brought in from the Haines Rodeo Grounds. “There were still people standing outside the gate that could not get in,” she said. “It was absolutely crazy how many people showed up.” Turner said plans are in the works to construct a small animal barn. Currently, a tent is used. She said the Friends of Fair Pie Auction in July raised $4,090 from 25 pies. Turner reported that the year end budget for her department came in about $1,900 under what she projected. Forest Service coordination Commission Chairman Bill Harvey asked for comments from people who attended a Commission/Forest Service coordination meeting on Sept. 30. Topics at that meeting — which allowed public attendance, but no public comment — were related to wildfires that burned about 150,000 acres of forest and rangeland in the county this summer. Chuck Chase, a member of the county’s Natural Resources Advisory Committee, thanked the commissioners for their efforts at the meeting and said it was an excellent start to the coordination process. Harvey said county staff will be meeting with Forest Service managers weekly, and the commissioners will meet with Wallowa-Whitman Supervisor Tom Montoya monthly. Chase asked about future operations in the (Baker City) watershed concerning fire danger. “We’re just one lightning storm away,” he said. “We did touch base on all the watersheds for all the towns in Baker County,” Harvey replied. “This is the beginning of a very long ongoing working relationship with (the Forest Service).” Harvey said he emphasized the need for fuels management in the watersheds along with expedited salvage logging in areas that have burned.
