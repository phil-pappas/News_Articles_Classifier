(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Ann Arbor — Blake O'Neill's first punt Saturday was a booming line drive that settled 80 yards away.\nHis last, well, he never got that one away — and he's taking extreme heat from Michigan fans stunned by their team's 27-23 loss to Michigan State on Saturday night.\n\"Blake O'Neill I hate you right now @ I hope you see this — (bleeping) bum,\" wrote one Twitter user.\n\"The UMich punter Blake O'Neill...R.I.P.\" wrote another.\nAnd those were some of the tamer ones.\nO'Neill, 22, was the target of several social-media attacks Saturday night, including some since-deleted death threats, following his fumble on the final play of the game that led to Michigan State's winning touchdown.\nThere is some good news, though, for those trying to find a way to retain faith in humanity: There were far more messages of support, and denouncing the wackos who spewed the death threats, than actual threats themselves.\n\"I talked to him,\" Michigan place-kicker Kenny Allen said. \"I just told him we're behind him. We support Blake through everything, and that's the kind of team we're going to be.\"\nFormer Michigan punter Will Hagerup also weighed in on Facebook, writing: \"You just saw first hand that punting is really hard. I challenge anyone to go catch a snap in 30-degree weather with 100,000 people watching. He had a terrific game and put our defense in great field position multiple times.\"\nO'Neill punted seven times, averaging 44.6 yards. Three times, he pinned Michigan State inside the 10-yard line — including once at the 2, with that 80-yard rocket in the opening quarter.\nBut fans don't want to remember that.\nThey'll forever remember his fumble — off a low snap — that helped deliver the Spartans their seventh win in the last eight meetings.\n\"He's done a good job,\" MSU coach Mark Dantonio said of O'Neill.\nAsked what words of advice he'd have for O'Neill, Dantonio said, \"Same thing I'd say to my guys, you know, things happen. Don't be too hard on yourself.\n\"You're looking for effort, you gave effort. You're looking for toughness, he plays with toughness.\":\ntpaul@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tonypaul1984 \n@blakewoneill What were you thinking dude.
