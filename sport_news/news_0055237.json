North Platte St. Pat's 5-110. Arcadia-Loup City 5-1 Bob Sez: Got some stuff going on here. Tell ya right now, Battle Creek (31-0 over Hartington CC) and Gibbon (64-0 over Centura) are both playing like teams that could be ranked even higher. West Holt (41-28 over Ainsworth) jumps up two spots, and its 14-7 win over Arcadia-Loup City actually pulls the Rebels into the top ten. Doniphan-Trumbull played Sutton close (16-13) but still falls two spots, taking St. Pat's, which it beat 26-20 in the opener, with it. Oakland-Craig (33-14) beat former No. 9 Stanton and has lost only to No. 4 Battle Creek. Oh yeah, Aquinas (49-0 over formerly unbeaten Brownell-Talbot) and St. Cecilia (54-13 over Southern Valley) won. Top Games for Week 7: Aquinas at Omaha Brownell-Talbot, Doniphan-Trumbull at Sutton, Battle Creek at Hartington Cedar Catholic, Bridgeport at North Platte St. Pat's. Class D-1 1.
