Banks (@PaulMBanks) October 19, 2015 Here it is again in Tecmo Bowl form. That hare brained Chuck Pagano play from last night. #Colts #Patriots https://t.co/3WsMui5QM1 \n— Big Daddy Suede (@soundwave803) October 20, 2015 It’s likely that Pagano won’t be back in Indy for 2016. Reportedly, Pagano and General Manager Ryan Grigson don’t get along. However, it’s not the WTFake Punt that will cost Chuck Pagano his job. Here is NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport on that : “My understanding is the Colts are expected to give Chuck Pagano this entire year to prove his worth to the organization. He turned down a one-year deal, what this organization values really above anything else with all of the talk of alleged internal conflict and all of those things, this is about wins and losses and they want to give Pagano every opportunity to prove that he is the coach they thought he was when they did hire him. As far as that fake punt, it was a disaster, it was embarrassing obviously. But this organization really liked how Pagano handled it in the aftermath. That gave them a little more confidence in him that he could deal with some of these really critical situations.” So it appears that the stupidest play call in NFL history, for as much damage as it did to the Chuck Pagano “brand,” has actually saved him in an inadvertent way. No one actually believes (or believed) that Pagano’s job status would be directly tied to the fake punt fail, but certainly the gaffe put him under the microscope. Ultimately, his overall body of work will decide his fate. Getting blown out by a New Orleans Saints that’s been awful most of the season today certainly doesn’t help. The Chuck Pagano seat is scorching hot right now. Reportedly, he has a tif with General Manager Ryan Grisgon and it’s very unlikely that he’ll be back in 2016. Will he even survive 2015 though?
