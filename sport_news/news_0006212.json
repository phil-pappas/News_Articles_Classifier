White said Geneva High School's artificial turf field had been secured for a 7:30 p.m. Friday home game with Guerin to open Metro Suburban East play. St. Edward's Greg True Field remains unplayable after a maintenance company accidentally destroyed much of the grass, so future home sites will be determined on a week-by-week basis.\n\"The outpouring of support we received has been tremendous, and we have to thank (Geneva athletic director) Jim Kafer for helping out,\" White said, pointing out Kafer's ties to St. Edward as the school's former athletic director.\nComing off a 41-6 loss at IC Catholic last week, the most pressing issue facing St. Edward (2-2) against Guerin (2-2) is manpower.\nCoach Mike Rolando hopes running back Dwayne Allen Jr. returns from an ankle injury. The injury list in the backfield runs even deeper because backup Patrick Brown also missed the last game with a concussion he suffered against Riverside-Brookfield.\n\"When you've only got 22 guys out, and you take away several of them, then you're really in need of someone to step up,\" Rolando said.\nAllen will be a game-time decision again this week, and Brown is out. Brown normally anchors the defense at linebacker.\nSt. Edward decides to hit the road, let grass grow on football field Gene Chamberlain St. Edward's home football game Friday night with IC Catholic has been moved to the Elmhurst school's field due to damage done to the grass at Greg True Field.\nAdministrators from St. Edward and IC Catholic, along with the officials set to work this week's game between the schools, examined St....\nSt. Edward's home football game Friday night with IC Catholic has been moved to the Elmhurst school's field due to damage done to the grass at Greg True Field.\nAdministrators from St. Edward and IC Catholic, along with the officials set to work this week's game between the schools, examined St....\n(Gene Chamberlain) Last week, junior running back Caleb Elam stepped in and rushed for 113 yards on 24 carries and a touchdown. Elam wasn't even on the roster when practice started this year, and it was the first game he was eligible.\n\"He had a fantastic game against IC, about our only high point,\" Rolando said. \"He wasn't in our offseason program and didn't come out until late August when we had a few others come out late.\n\"It was good to see another quality running back.\"\nLosing Allen also removed the team's most experienced cornerback, but sophomore Tyler Holte filled in a week after he played corner on the other side when starter Saveon Smith was away due to a death in his family.\nThe St. Edward secondary expects to be tested this week by Guerin quarterback Richie Zacharias throwing to 6-foot-4 receiver Keith Franklin and speedy slotback Felix King.\n\"We'll have our hands full, for sure,\" Rolando said. \"They lost to Aurora Central Catholic (37-28). We did beat ACC (41-0), but we were a different team then. We're missing important parts now.\"\nField secured, St. Edward hopes for return of Dwayne Allen Jr. Mike Mantucca / The Courier-News St. Edward's Dwayne Allen Jr.gains yardage during a game against Riverside-Brookfield.

(Mike Mantucca / The Courier-News) No comment: Rolando did not want to weigh in on the ongoing dispute between Guerin coach Glen Kozlowski, the former Chicago Bear, and ACC coach John Belskis.\nIn a Chicago Tribune article, Belskis accused Kozlowski of threatening to fight him, targeting his son — quarterback Johnny Belskis — with late hits and said Guerin players had thrown rocks at the team bus.\n\"We just got beat 41-6, and we've got enough of our own worries with injuries and other things, so we can't be concerned with sideline antics and beefs coaches have,\" Rolando said. \"Guerin has a good football team. We got down to them 13-0 last year when we were an undefeated team, so we'll worry about ourselves.\"\nHealing Chargers: Dundee-Crown (1-3) looks healthier for Friday's showdown at home against District 300 rival Jacobs (4-0) in a Fox Valley Valley opener, as junior guard Oscar Nava and senior linebacker Joey Flores return from injuries.\nStopping the power running attack of twins Mathew and Sean Barnes ranks high for Dundee-Crown's defense. The Chargers allowed more than 600 total rushing yards to Morris and Prairie Ridge in losses.\n\"We looked improved the last game against a great Prairie Ridge team, and we played hard. But as a team, we're sick of should-haves and could-haves and want to take the next step and win,\" Chargers coach Mike Steinhaus said.\nGchamberlain@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @genechamberlai2\nCopyright © 2015, Elgin Courier-News Dwayne Allen Sports Patrick Brown", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56032248/turbine/ct-ctlfl-ct-ecn-football-st-edward-riverside-broo-20150923", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56032e98/turbine/ct-ecn-football-notes-st-edward-st-0924-20150923", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55fb5b33/turbine/ct-ecn-football-st-edward-field-st-0918-20150917"], "published": "2015-09-24T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:50:43.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
