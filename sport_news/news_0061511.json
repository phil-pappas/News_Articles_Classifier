Available patterns in the 4” size include Kryptek Highlander, Desert and Brown.\nBellingham, WA (PRWEB) October 22, 2015\nMcNett® Tactical is pleased to announce that its best-selling camouflage wrap, Camo Form ®, is now available in larger 4-inch rolls. New patterns in the 4” size include Kryptek Highlander, Desert and Brown.\n“These are the same size rolls that U.S. military snipers are issued in every sniper kit,” said Gerald Craft, consumer marketing director. “The larger size tends to make wrapping easier and is ideal for larger rifles or shotguns.”\nBesides weapons, Camo Form can also be used to wrap gear. Not only does it allow users to camouflage items on the fly, but it also adds grip, protects the item from scratches, helps in reducing noise and clanking, and insulates hands from hot or cold surfaces. Use it to wrap binoculars, scopes, knives, tree stands, flashlights, etc.\n“The best part about Camo Form is that it does not utilize any sticky adhesives or residues,” said Craft. “Instead, it adheres to itself, which means it won’t leave a sticky residue on guns or gear.”\nThe 4-inch rolls of Camo Form camo wrap are now available in Kryptek Highlander, Desert and Brown.

It conforms to any shape and clings to itself as it’s wrapped around the item. Camo Form improves grip and insulates hands from uncomfortably hot or cold surfaces, while also preventing items from slipping in the field or clanking against other objects. Camo Form is reusable and leaves no sticky residue.
