He has been an outstanding club captain and should be very proud of what he has achieved. \n\"Jimmy still has a huge amount to offer. He is a model professional and continues to have a positive influence on those around him. His advice and support will be invaluable as the club looks ahead to its next phase.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:05:42.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
