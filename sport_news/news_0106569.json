The Grizzlies' 86-76 loss to the Orlando Magic in Amway Center was their seventh and final exhibition contest before the regular-season opener Wednesday against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nA number of teams played only six preseason games. Most coaches and team executives would like to play just four preseason games.\n\"I don't know that we need four weeks of preseason,\" Joerger said. \"That would be one way to stretch out (an 82-game regular season) is bringing the preseason down a little bit.\"\nJoerger all but conceded the preseason finale with an eye on three remaining practice days to tighten up schemes and principles. Forward Jeff Green was the only potential starter who played against Orlando.\nThe game might have been three too many on the schedule but it provided an opportunity for second-year guard Jordan Adams to play for the first time after nursing a knee injury for most of training camp.\nStill, Joerger has given key players games off and limited their minutes throughout the preseason.\nCoaches prefer practice time.\n\"You need practice time. Guys need to be able to prepare and get comfortable with each other, get comfortable with whatever you're trying to implement,\" Brooklyn Nets coach Lionel Hollins told the Associated Press. \"It's hard in the preseason when you're playing and traveling like you do during the regular season. There's really no need to.\"\nJoerger would welcome a shorter preseason so that the NBA could lengthen the regular-season calendar to create more rest opportunities for players. However, the league must find the right balance. Joerger didn't see a lot of value in the Grizzlies' 11-day layoff during the all-star break last season.\n\"It just compressed our schedule in March into mush,\" Joerger said. \"I like lengthening the all-star break to a point. Having 11 days off is a little too long because it costs you later.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/XiDZI1hQYS8"], "published": "2015-10-24T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:43:58.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
