ARMAS The Associated Press \nMILWAUKEE â€“ Kyle Hendricks allowed one hit and struck out eight in six innings, and the Chicago Cubs kept alive their hopes to host to the NL wild card game with a 1-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night. \nChicago won its seventh straight game behind a stellar effort from Hendricks (8-7). He held Milwaukee without a baserunner until Martin Maldonado singled with one out in the sixth. \nMaldonado grounded into a double play two innings later that allowed reliever Fernando Rodney to escape a first-and-third jam with one out. \nHector Rondon tossed a scoreless ninth for his 30th save. \nThe Cubs will face Pittsburgh in the wild card matchup on Wednesday. The Pirates lost 3-1 to Cincinnati on Saturday, leaving them one game ahead of the Cubs, who hold the tiebreaker. \nAddison Russell drove in the game's only run off Tyler Wagner (0-2), singling home Chris Coughlan from third in the second inning. The bevy of visiting Chicago fans cheered, making Miller Park feel like Wrigley Field North for another night. \nThey watched Hendricks rely on a sinker and changeup to baffle the Brewers. Counting Saturday's start, Hendricks will enter the postseason having thrown 12 straight shutout innings. \nA September call-up from Double-A Biloxi, Wagner nearly matched scoreless frames with Hendricks. Wagner worked out of trouble to hold Chicago's potent lineup to seven hits over six innings. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nCubs: RHP Jason Motte, who has been on DL since Aug. 24 with a sprained right shoulder, left the Cubs on Saturday to continue his rehabilitation at the team's complex in Arizona. The veteran reliever isn't expected to available for the wild card game on Wednesday, but might be ready if the team advances. \nUP NEXT \nCubs: RHP Dan Haren (10-9) finishes the regular season for the Cubs by making his 11th start since coming over in a deadline deal with Miami. He is 3-1 with a 2.43 ERA in six career appearances against the Brewers, including five starts. \nBrewers: RHP Jorge Lopez (1-0) makes his second career start after winning his major league debut on Tuesday in a 4-3 victory over San Diego. Lopez is the Southern League Pitcher of the Year after going 12-5 with a 2.26 ERA in 24 starts for Double-A Biloxi. \n___ \nFollow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:33:17.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
