He is targeting those who have made notable contribution for which they are celebrated nationally and globally. There cannot be a greater insult,\" Sharma said.\nHe argued that the writers are not aligned politically but believe in free of expression. \"It is expected of the government to listen to what they are saying but this government is bent upon encouraging the forces which we can call as divisive with an agenda which will undermine the very idea of India,\" the spokesperson said.\nCongress, however, steered clear of the observations on India in the US State Department report on International Religious Freedom for 2014. \"It is an issue concerning the nation so we will be able to judge it better than others (outsiders). We will not judge the government by what others are saying. We will judge the government on the basis of the situation on the ground,\" Sharma said.
