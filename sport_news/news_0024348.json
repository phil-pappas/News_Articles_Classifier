Ottawa (Kan.) had been ranked No. 18 going into that showdown. \nThe OKWU Lady Eagles — who are coached by Vladan Glavonic — are 8-1-1 on the season and 3-0 in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference. \nThey are the lone KCAC team appearing in this week’s Top 25 poll. \nConference members Ottawa and Kansas Wesleyan both appeared in the Others Receiving Votes list. \nNext up, the Lady Eagles are home tonight to take on Saint Mary. Starting time is 5 p.m. \nEagles \nAlthough the Oklahoma Wesleyan University men’s soccer team is accustomed to being in the Top 25, the Eagles still felt a major boost by climbing in this week’s NAIA Men’s Soccer Coaches Top 25 Poll to No. 3 in the nation. \nThe Eagles leapfrogged from No. 4 to No. 3 after last week’s No. 3-ranked Vanguard (Calif.) lost. \nThe Eagles received 462 voting points, just 20 fewer than No. 2 Davenport and only 36 shy of top-ranked Rio Grande (Ohio). \nOKWU — which is coached by Jamie Peterson — is sitting at 10-1 overall and 3-0 in the KCAC. \nThey have outscored their most recent four opponents by a total of 20-2. \nThe Eagles are slated to be home at 7:30 p.m. tonight to face Saint Mary.
