(AP) - A dog park is getting closer to opening in Shreveport.\nThe Times reports ( http://bit.ly/1PfAFMC ) that designs for the park were shown to the public last week.\nOfficials are planning to have the five-acre dog park open by next summer. The park will be built inside Stoner Park.\nThe park's plans call for a dog pond, tunnels, pavilion, entrance plaza and dog memorial.\nThe park was designed on a $26,000 budget finalized in September 2014. Then the Shreveport Dog Park Alliance also was given $280,000 from the Red River Waterway Commission for the park's construction.\nInformation from: The Times, http://www.shreveporttimes.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
