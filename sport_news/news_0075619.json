(AP) - Gov. Tom Wolf is warning that he may halt horse racing in Pennsylvania in a week because a state budget stalemate has compounded the troubles of the State Racing Fund. \nWolf’s spokesman told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Thursday that the four-month budget stalemate with the Legislature has left the state without the resources to prop up the fund. \nThe Inquirer reports (http://bit.ly/1OL2k9h ) that Wolf press secretary Jeff Sheridan says the administration will shut down racing Oct. 30 if a solution isn’t reached before then. \nSix Pennsylvania tracks offer thoroughbred or harness racing. \nThe fund pays for licensing, safety, equine laboratory operations and drug-testing of horses and is funded through a tax on horse racing wagers, which have been steadily declining for years. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:20:10.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
