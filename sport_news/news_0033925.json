And the emotion was never stronger - on both sides. \nU.S. captain Jay Haas made his son one of two wild-card selections, and he put him out in the last of 12 singles matches at Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea against the local star, Bae Sang-moon, playing in his final event before he starts his mandatory military service in South Korea. \nBae did everything he could to give the International team a chance by holing a 10-foot putt on the 16th to stay 1 down and nearly holing a bunker shot on the 17th for par to extend the match. Needing to win the par-5 18th to share the cup, Bae stubbed his chip short of the green. As the ball rolled back down the slope, Bae sank to his knees and covered his eyes as caddie Matt Minister consoled him. Haas blasted out of a bunker to 6 feet, and Bae conceded the birdie putt, giving Haas a 2-up victory. \nThe biggest putt belonged to Chris Kirk, the only American who had never played in a Presidents Cup or Ryder Cup, especially because of the shocking turnaround in the match and in deciding who won the gold trophy. Kirk was all square with Anirban Lahiri of India, both just short of the 18th green. Kirk hit his pitch too hard and it went 15 feet by the cup, while Lahiri played his shot with perfect pace to 4 feet. \nKirk slammed his fist down when his putt took one last turn and dropped into the cup. It looked as though they would halve the match until Lahiri’s birdie putt hit the right side of the cup and spun out, and he let his putter fall over his back in disbelief. \nBranden Grace joined Shigeki Maruyama (1998) as the only International player to go 5-0 by easily beating Matt Kuchar. Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson each completed unbeaten weeks for the Americans, and Adam Scott got his putter going in the shortest match of the day, 6 and 5, over Rickie Fowler. \nLPGA MALAYSIA \nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Jessica Korda won the LPGA Malaysia for her fourth tour title, closing with a 6-under 65 in sweltering conditions for a four-stroke victory. \nAfter winning twice last season, the 22-year-old American entered the week with only one top-10 finish this year, a tie for second in January in Florida in the season-opening event. \nShe made five birdies in a seven-hole stretch that ended on the 10th, dropped a stroke on the par-4 11th and sealed it with birdies on the par-3 15th and 17th. Second-ranked Lydia Ko, No. 3 Stacy Lewis and 2014 winner Shanshan Feng tied for second. \nKorda finished at 18-under 266 and earned $300,000. She opened with rounds of 69, 67 and 65 to take a two-stroke lead into the final day. The weekend 65s are her two best scores this year. \nKo finished with a 66. The 18-year-old New Zealander was coming off consecutive victories in Canada and France, where she became the youngest major champion. Feng also had a 66, and Lewis shot 67. \nSAS CHAMPIONSHIP \nCARY, N.C. (AP) - Tom Lehman had an eagle and three birdies in the final four holes to win the Champions Tour’s SAS Championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:21:52.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
