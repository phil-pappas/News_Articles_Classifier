The Cougars topped a six-team field with a score of 396, 51 strokes ahead of second-place East Dubuque. \"I'm just happy that we have a conference champion,\" Eastland coach Ben Hill said. \"I've wanted one for a long time. I'm a golf professional, so anything to help golf grow in juniors is awesome.\" The Stockton boys, meanwhile, won their second straight conference tournament with a 347. Polo was a close second at 358, followed by East Dubuque with 370. Stockton's Alex Staver is the boys individual champion, shooting a season-low 75, while Eastland's Karissa Freidag won the girls title for the second straight year with an 80. A freshman, Staver said cold, blustery conditions in the morning didn't bother him. His goal, he said, was winning the team title after the Blackhawks took the regular season championship for the second consecutive year. \"I didn't know where we were standing (during the tournament), but I was more focused on that,\" Staver said. Staver entered the tournament seeded first in a three-way tie with Forreston's Bryan Edler and East Dubuque's Michael Motsch. Edler finished ninth overall with an 87, tied with Polo's Tristin Woodin and Aquin's Connor Shoemaker. Motsch did not place with an 89. Stockton's Peyton Keeffer (80) and Zach Lacher (82) finished third and fourth, respectively, to help propel Stockton to the boys team title. Sophomore Megan Gille, who is the school's lone female golfer, has golfed fourth for the boys most of the season. Gille finished second in the girls' tournament with an 84. \"It's a great thing because the boys root for her and she roots for them. They have a nice camaraderie,\" Stockton coach Casey Kenna said. Stockton will look to win its fourth straight regional title on Tuesday at Galena Golf Club, beginning at 8:30 a.m. Freidag and her Eastland teammates will travel to Oregon for the girls regional, hoping to build on momentum from the conference tournament. Freidag qualified for the state tournament as an individual in 2014. This year, she hopes to take her teammates with her. \"We were having some rough times (earlier in the season), and we were like, 'Oh my gosh, we need to fix this. Conference and regionals (are) coming up,'\" Freidag said. \"We all fixed it and are doing great right now. It feels good.\" Other boys' medalists: West Carroll's Anthony Mendoza was second (79); Chris Rademacher (Polo) and Eastland's Curt Strauss tied for fifth with an 84; Pecatonica's Erik Durand and Kane Hyde (Galena) each shot 85 for seventh; Cameron Ehrlers (West Carroll) and Austin Beschen (East Dubuque) finished tied for 12th with an 88. Other girls' medalists: Forreston's Kaitlin Korf, Naeva Groenewold and Eastland's Bailey Heckman took third with a 91; Haley Guilinger (West Carroll) was sixth with a 94.
