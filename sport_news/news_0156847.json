However, if you don't have to pass, then there's no reason to do it until it's really needed. West Allegheny is averaging 323.8 yards per game on the ground, led by senior running back Terence Stephens is averaging 128 yards per game (46 carries for 512 yards and nine touchdowns on the ground). Whitney White is the second-leading rusher with 299 yards on 34 carries to go with five rushing touchdowns. Tom Burke (34 total tackles) and Kamren Cornell (26 total tackles) are the leading tacklers on defense. West Allegheny has only given up 28 points in four games. \nThe Spartans got back in the win column last week with a 17-15 over Hopewell. Quarterback Tyler Carswell is averaging over 120 yards of total offense per game. Running back David Haseleu has rushed for 242 yards and a touchdown through the first four weeks. Montour lost to Chartiers Valley 27-14, a team that West Allegheny beat 49-7 earlier in the week before. \nMontour really doesn't throw the ball that much, so defensively they'll want to focus on shutting down Montour's running game. Offensively, the key will be to get Stephens his touches as usual to get him going. \nThey cannot get into a high-scoring affair with West Allegheny. Montour may have to commit to putting eight-in-the-box to stop West Allegheny's running attack and force them to throw the ball. That may not be a fool-proof plan because it's not as if West Allegheny has needed to throw the ball in its first four games. Tackling will be major for the Spartans and defensive line of Montour will have to stand their ground or it will be a long night for the Spartans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:28:48.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
