(AP Photo, File) \nLONDON (AP) — Ferrari, arguably the most famous brand in sports cars, is gearing up for a share listing in New York on Wednesday that it hopes will help it back to the top of the Formula One tree. \nFerrari, which has won 15 drivers’ world titles and 16 constructors’ championships since Formula One started in 1950, has been lagging other teams on the grid over the past few years. \nKimi Raikkonen was Ferrari’s last world champion, back in 2007, joining a legendary list of winners including Alberto Ascari in the 1950s, Niki Lauda in the 1970s and Michael Schumacher in the 2000s. \nFor a team that’s the only one to have competed in every season in Formula One history and has the greatest number of fans worldwide, the dearth of success is concerning. \nAhead of the listing, which could value the company owned by Fiat Chrysler at around $10 billion, Ferrari said the “prestige, identity and appeal” of the brand depend on the success of the racing team. \n“If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary talent to succeed in international competitions or devote the capital necessary to fund successful racing activities, the value of the Ferrari brand and the appeal of our cars and other luxury goods may suffer,” it said. \nThe stakes are high for a company that was founded in 1929 by Enzo Ferrari, a former driver himself, as a means to help out owner-drivers to race. By 1947, it was producing its own cars. \nSince then, the cars, both racing and road, that have emerged from the Maranello factory in northern Italy have gleamed and excited. \nThe Associated Press has followed Ferrari for decades. Here are some of the most memorable vehicles as captured by photographers from The AP.
