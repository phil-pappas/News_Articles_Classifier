Temperatures are only in the low 60s (which is actually the norm for this time of year), and we have northwest winds 15-30 miles per hour. \nWinds will die down tonight, but with a clear sky and dry air that means it is going to get cold. We’re forecasting overnight lows in the 20s to low 30s. A Freeze Warning is posted for the entire region, meaning that temperatures will be cold enough to effectively end the crop growing season. Keep plants covered or brought inside if you want to cheat Mother Nature a little longer. \nTomorrow will be a sunny but cool day. We’ll have a northwest wind 5-15 miles per hour, but despite the sunshine we’ll only have highs in the 50s, which is cooler than normal for this time of year. \nThe out of state pheasant season begins on Saturday, so we’re forecasting a lot of vehicles on rural roads. Besides that, it will be a sunny and pleasant day. Highs should be in the upper 50s East River to the low 60s East River. In general, we expect southeast winds 10-15 miles per hour – but I suspect the winds might be a little stronger than that in south central South Dakota. \nSunday is going to be another mostly sunny and dry day. It will also be a breezy day, but the winds will be from a southerly direction so it will also be warmer. Sunday’s highs should be in the mid 60s East River to the low 70s West River. \nMonday will also be breezy and warmer. With a partly cloudy sky, we’re going for the upper 60s to mid 70s – ten to fifteen degrees above normal. \nWe’re putting showers in the forecast Tuesday and Wednesday next week, but at this point it looks like they will be very light because the air will still be dry. Highs should be near-normal, in the 60s much of the rest of the week. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
