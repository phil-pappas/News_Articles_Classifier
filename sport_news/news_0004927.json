Bratton did not represent Ukwuachu in the original trial. Bratton cited several perceived irregularities in requesting Monday's hearing.\nIn August Judge Matt Johnson sentenced Ukwuachu to 180 days in jail and 10 years probation. On Monday, Johnson denied a request for bail during the appeals process,\nUkwuachu, a defensive end who never played for the Bears after transferring from Boise State, has been serving his sentence in McLennan County jail. He appeared in court in handcuffs while wearing county-issued prison stripes.\nMore on the Ukwuachu story, including opinions and analysis, here:\nOn Twitter:\n @bhorn55", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bhorn55"], "published": "2015-10-26T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:47:10.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
