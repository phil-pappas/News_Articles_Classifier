He got sacked seven times, need x-rays on his left hand after the game and had little chance given the supporting cast around him. Stafford wasn't perfect. He missed a big play to Calvin Johnson late in the first half. But he was the least of the Lions' concerns Sunday and did a good job buying time on the Lions' second touchdown to find an open Eric Ebron on his second read. Grade: B-minus\nRunning backs\nThe Lions ran for 77 yards on 17 carries, an average of 4.5 yards per run, but they couldn't convert their most important rushing plays. Both George Winn and Michael Burton got stopped for no gain on the goal line, and the Lions had to burn a timeout in the third quarter when they lined up with 10 men on offense when Burton ran late onto the field. Ameer Abdullah had 43 yards and rushing and could use a few more carries, and Joique Bell was surprisingly effective (three carries, 21 yards) in limited use in his return from an Achilles injury. Grade: C-minus\nReceivers/tight ends\nJohnson and Eric Ebron both had big catches in the Lions' hot start, then disappeared in the second half. Ebron had five catches for 89 yards and a touchdown, Johnson had five for 86 and a score, while Golden Tate and Lance Moore were mostly invisible. Tate did drop a pass on a shallow crossing route in the second quarter. The Lions probably didn't win enough downfield, but it's not like they had chances to get open given Minnesota's pressure, either. Grade: C-plus\nOffensive line\nThe Vikings got a number of their eight sacks from unblocked rushers, and while that doesn't fall completely on the offensive line, the guys up front deserve much of the blame. On one third-quarter sack, the entire middle of the Lions' offensive line blocked no one while Anthony Barr, Everson Griffen and others came overpowered Ebron on the edge. Griffen had another sack when he didn't bite on a play fake, and for some reason Travis Swanson was asked to pick him up off the edge from his center position. Coaches did not always put the line in a position to succeed. Grade: F\nDefensive line\nZiggy Ansah might have been the best player on the field Sunday. He had one sack, three quarterback hits, forced a fumble and chased Adrian Peterson down after a 75-yard run to prevent a touchdown. Haloti Ngata overpowered Brandon Fusco for a third-down sack on Teddy Bridgewater early in the second quarter, and Caraun Reid (six tackles, four for loss) had a standout day rushing the passer and against the run. Devin Taylor did a good job setting the edge, too, as the Lions bottled up Peterson outside of his one long run. Grade: A-minus\nLinebackers\nTravis Lewis appeared to be at fault on Peterson's 75-yard gain, when he missed a run fit after Jason Jones rushed inside the right tackle. Josh Bynes and Stephen Tulloch had eight tackles each and were solid against the run. Bynes forced an incompletion on Minnesota's opening drive with a good blitz and beat his blocker to hem Peterson in for a 4-yard loss on Minnesota's first play of its second series. Tulloch recovered a fumble Grade: B-minus\nDefensive backs\nThe Vikings entered Sunday with the NFL's worst passing offense and promptly picked the Lions apart for 316 yards. Rashean Mathis, who left in the fourth quarter with a brain injury, got burned twice on double moves. He got beat badly for a touchdown by Stefon Diggs early in the third quarter and drew an illegal contact penalty to stop a probable touchdown to Mike Wallace in the first half. Quandre Diggs picked up a huge defensive holding penalty after it appeared the Lions got off the field with a third-down sack of Bridgewater. James Ihedigbo had seven tackles while splitting time with Isa Abdul-Quddus in his return from a quad injury. Grade: D-minus\nSpecial teams\nMatt Prater stayed perfect on the year, making his only kick from 52 yards and Sam Martin averaged 49.3 yards on his punts. Abdullah was pulled from his kick-return duties after he nearly fumbled away another kickoff (the ground caused the fumble). And the Lions had another special teams penalty, this one a holding call in the first half. Grade: B\nCoaching\nJim Caldwell said his team looked \"inept\" at times, and he was right. There's no reason the Lions, for the second time this year, should get off to such a good start then completely fizzle out. They didn't have enough counter punches after the Vikings adjusted to their initial offensive onslaught, and once again they looked lifeless as things started to spiral away. Joe Lombardi did have some well-designed plays early, but the general dysfunction (10 men on the field) and use of personnel (runs to Winn, Burton) was questionable. Grade: D\nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.
