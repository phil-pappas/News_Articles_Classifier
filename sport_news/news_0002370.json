No. 6 Clemson handed Miami its worst defeat in the program's 90-year history Saturday, rolling to a 58-0 win to remain unbeaten. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) × MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Dabo Swinney, getting angrier by the word, yelled at his players Saturday at halftime of a 58-0 Atlantic Coast Conference rout at Miami. He refused to let them leave the Sun Life Stadium Field, teaching the Tigers about focus. Never mind that No. 6 Clemson had a 42-0 lead as Hurricane fans hurried away. “You know,” the head coach said later, “it’s one thing to play with emotion – this is a game of emotion. But it isn’t OK to be emotional.” Of all games for a lecture. The suspense didn’t last as long as a cup of Cuban coffee. A purposeful Clemson traveling party recorded the school’s most lopsided road win in a century and handed Miami its largest margin of defeat. In the grand scheme, Clemson (7-0) would love to return to 347 Don Shula Drive on Dec. 31 for a College Football Playoff game in the Orange Bowl, but would settle for a playoff spot in the Cotton Bowl. Crafting a remarkable 58-0 rout while juggling the bigger picture speaks to the resolve of these Tigers, and the grip the coaching staff has on the team psyche. Halftime speeches during spectacular performances are part of that. “We were doing too much talking and we don’t need to do that,” wide receiver Artavis Scott said. “We were getting into their game, and that’s not what we do. We just needed to relax and play.” The jawing started early. Game officials had to separate the teams twice before the game. “Being down at home, we knew it was kind of embarrassing,” left guard Eric Mac Clain said. “We knew they were going to try to do something to provoke us.” Miami (4-3) was supposed to be dangerous, a 7-point underdog coming off good games against Florida State (29-24 loss) and Virginia Tech (30-20 win). Yawn. The Tigers were as comfortable in South Florida as a chubby iguana. They made Sun Life Stadium quieter than a Marlins game. Dabo, Mr. Miami Swinney, 45, doesn’t seem like a man with a lot of white sport coats and teal T-shirts, but bet he could get comped on South Beach after beating Urban Meyer and Ohio State in the Orange Bowl 21 months ago and now this. What a bounce back after that 70-33 loss to West Virginia in the 2012 Orange Bowl. Nice timing, too, with ABC televising the drubbing nationally and the first College Football Playoff poll due out Nov. 3. Clemson players will probably be aware of that when they take the field next Saturday at N.C. State. “Whether we’re one of the best four teams right now doesn’t matter to me,” Swinney said. “After we play 12 games, then it will matter.” In the critical game of recent impressions, what’s not to like? Clemson put together a quick-paced scoring drive, alert safety Jadar Johnson jumped a Miami wheel route for an interception, quarterback Deshaun Watson sparked another scoring drive with a 63-yard run. That was the first eight minutes. It got better for Clemson on the way to 416 rushing yards for the day. Booing the home team For Miami, the booing began at 21-0 with 2:08 left in the first quarter. Sure, Miami will be in the coach-search business soon as fans and former Hurricane players active on Twitter wanted Al Golden to bolt for the Everglades before halftime. Miami’s rally chances got worse with quarterback Brad Kaaya, who wobbled to the locker room for a concussion check-up in the second quarter. But Kaaya wasn’t going to halt the Clemson offense and Miami coaching ineptness didn’t account for all 58 points. Kaaya did, however, get Clemson’s attention last week after the Hurricanes lost to Florida State. “I want to see Florida State again (in the ACC championship game),” the quarterback said. It’s possible. It’s more likely Clemson sees Miami again – the city, not the reeling team – for a College Football Playoff Game in late December.
