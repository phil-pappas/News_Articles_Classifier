Allen, Jr., Associated Press) Josh Robbins Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel The preseason opener showed the Magic have plenty of work to do \nBefore the Orlando Magic stepped onto their practice court Sunday morning, they gathered around a video screen with their coaches to review almost 60 video clips from their preseason opener the night before. \nMany of the videos painted an unflattering picture. Early in the third quarter, the Magic's starting five of Elfrid Payton, Victor Oladipo, Tobias Harris, Channing Frye and Dewayne Dedmon let up on the Charlotte Hornets so thoroughly that coach Scott Skiles subbed out the quintet all at once. \nIf the 106-100 loss revealed nothing else, it's that the Magic are still susceptible to their own worst impulses, such as playing through stretches without urgency, missing too many defensive assignments and not demanding enough from themselves. Although the three previous seasons helped the franchise restock its roster through the draft, the constant losing came at a price: the slackening of the team's culture and expectations. \n\"If we had really, really high-level winning habits, we wouldn't have won 25 games\" last season, Skiles said. \"There's a lot of habits we've got to change. The good thing is the guys are willing.\" \nTo be sure, it would've been unrealistic to expect the Magic to play perfectly against the Hornets. What bothered Skiles, however, was his team's tendency to be satisfied with merely a decent performance. The Magic outscored the Hornets 51-48 in the first half and then started the third quarter as if they already had accomplished enough to make the preseason opener a success. Scott Skiles says playing without energy is \"not OK\" \nMagic coach Scott Skiles discusses his team's 106-100 loss to the Hornets in the preseason opener \nMagic coach Scott Skiles discusses his team's 106-100 loss to the Hornets in the preseason opener \nInstead of thinking that they had played well enough for the first exhibition game, Skiles wanted the Magic to tell themselves something like, \"We still need to improve in order to win a winner-take-all playoff game on the road.\" \nSkiles is seeking nothing less than a change in the Magic's collective mentality. \n\"When we come to practice every day or when we go into the games, Coach tells us we're not playing against the worst team in the league no matter who we come out and play against,\" Dedmon said. \"We're playing against the top team in the league, trying to play against the best and get ready for that.\" \nBefore the start of training camp, Skiles told his players that they will be subbed out if they make the same mistakes repeatedly in a game. His warning came true when he took out Payton, Oladipo, Harris, Frye and Dedmon en masse from Saturday night's exhibition. \n\"You can see if you're not doing your job, you're coming out,\" Payton said. \"He's not wasting time. So I think guys will be more alert and in the right position.\" \nSkiles' arrival represents a sea change for the Magic. \n\"For people who kind of get into the ways of doing the same thing over and over and over, to have [someone] different come in and completely mix things up, it can be a little bit of a shock,\" said Magic newcomer Jason Smith. \"But it depends if it's a shock for the good or for the bad, and I think this is a shock for the good.\" \nIf the Magic were a veteran team that had been to the playoffs in recent seasons, Skiles said, he would have convened the team Sunday to watch the video clips and then held a short practice. \nInstead, he put the team through a longer workout. \n\"Nobody came in here today thinking, 'We're just going to get massages and go home,'\" Skiles said. \"They came in here to work today, and it was very evident when we looked at the stuff. It's been a willing group that listens well, but now we've got another game coming up and hopefully we'll come out and play longer stretches of better basketball.\" \njrobbins@orlandosentinel.com .
