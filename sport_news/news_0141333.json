If effort’s the problem, you implode. If it’s not, you just coach them really hard.” \nThat’s also been the strategy this week for completing drives in the red zone. \n“That’s what it comes down to, execution,” running back Ezekiel Elliott said. “The more practice the more we’ll execute. We’re really close. That’s definitely something we’ve been waiting for. I feel it coming.” \nOhio State has six touchdowns and six field goals to show for 16 trips inside the 20. \n“Red-zone production, we’ve spent more time than normal on it (in practice),” Meyer said. \nThe Terrapins (2-3, 0-1) might be the elixir. Maryland is 110th in total defense, allowing 449.4 yards per game and are 103rd (199.8) against the rush. \nElliott ran for 274 yards last week in the 34-27 victory over Indiana but overall the offense has lacked consistency. He said not to worry. \n“The way we progressed last year was perfect,” he said. “You never want to peak too early in the season. You look at this time last year. We were probably in the same place if not behind.” \nOhio State entered the fourth game last season at Maryland with a 2-1 record and still feeling its way with new quarterback J.T. Barrett, who took over after Braxton Miller sustained a season-ending shoulder injury before the first game. \nThe Buckeyes won 52-24 and had 533 total yards, 267 through the air by Barrett. He also threw for four touchdowns and ran for another. \n“That was one of the best games we played last year,” Meyer said. \nDespite Ohio State being nearly a five-touchdown favorite vs. Maryland, linebacker Cam Williams expects the Terrapins to be at their finest. \n“When you’re playing against Ohio State, you’re playing against the defending champions and all that stuff, people get caught up in it,” he said, “We’re going to get their best shot. We’re going to get the best shots from the coaches, from the players.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:05:48.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
