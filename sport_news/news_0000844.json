Russell broke a bone in his neck against the Cyclones. \nRussell is averaging a national-best 10.5 yards per attempt this season, is tied for the national lead with 29 touchdown passes and leads the nation with a 189.72 quarterback rating. \nAssuming Russell will miss the rest of the season, Baylor will turn to true freshman Jarrett Stidham, who has completed 85.7 percent of his pass attempts this season for 331 yards and six scores. Baylor backup Jarrett Stidham, who played at Stephenville HS in Texas (where Art Briles coached), has 6 TDs in 28 passes \n— Mark Schlabach (@Mark_Schlabach) October 26, 2015 \nThe Bears next play Nov. 5 at Kansas State, so Stidham will have plenty of time to get in first-team reps. He was the No. 2 dual-threat quarterback recruit in the class of 2015, according to 247Sports . However, Baylor’s schedule gets much tougher from here on out, with games against No. 14 Oklahoma, No. 12 Oklahoma State and No. 5 TCU following the game at Kansas State.
