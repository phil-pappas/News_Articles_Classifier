It says a lot about my contribution and the coaches that have had faith in me.\" \nYet, Fabregas rejected that the number of centurions in the squad is a sign that more fresh blood is needed to take Spain back to the heights of recent years. \n\"Now we have a different team because some important players have gone, but the youngsters and those of us still here provide an important base for the team to build on. \n\"It would be good if we can continue to be successful and in France win a third consecutive Euros.\" \nDel Bosque will be forced into naming a patched up starting line-up as two of the 100-cap brigade, Sergio Ramos and Andres Iniesta, are missing through injury. \nCaptain Iker Casillas is expected to keep his place in goal despite David de Gea's fine form since returning to action with Manchester United. \nAnd Gerard Pique will marshall the defence despite being booed by some of the Spain support in recent matches at home for mocking Real Madrid during Barcelona's treble-winning celebrations at the end of last season.
