The 29-year-old didn’t act gruff or flustered.\nConversely, Mayo isn’t trumpeting his potential re-emergence this week, as the Patriots must prepare for the possibility Dont’a Hightower can’t play on Sunday night in Indianapolis against the Colts due to his injured ribs. Mayo took over for Hightower during last Sunday’s road victory against the Dallas Cowboys, and the seven-time captain would be the logical replacement again if Hightower is unavailable.\nBut Mayo isn’t acting any differently this week, just like he hadn’t under different circumstances prior to the Pats’ first four games.\n“I’m just a levelheaded guy, man,” Mayo said yesterday before a pre-practice workout. “I’m not really emotional. It’s not a trait that I have. It must be the military background.”\nMayo’s grandfather, Walter Johnson, was his father figure as a child. Johnson was a chief master sergeant in the Air Force, and he was stoic, stern and respected in retirement. There were no ups and downs, ebbs and flows or twists and turns in the Mayo household under Johnson’s guidance.\n“He raised us like a military family,” Mayo said. “It was always no emotion.”\nMayo greatly appreciated his grandfather’s “heavy presence” to shape his childhood for an incalculable amount of reasons, and it’s possibly helping him now. After all, how often in the NFL does the guy with the second-highest contract on the defense sit on the bench without a gripe in the world?\nThough Mayo hasn’t been spotted as frequently on Sundays, his teammates have seen the same leader Monday-Sunday.\nMaybe Mayo felt he has owed it to them.\n“Those guys are like my brothers,” Mayo said. “Go out there and play each and every week, and when my number is called, I’ll be ready to go.”\nMayo has only played 73 defensive snaps this season (26.6 percent), but his opportunities increased each week from 11 snaps in the opener to 16 to 17 to 29 against the Cowboys. Even still, with Hightower going down Sunday in the first quarter, Mayo only played 40.8 percent of the defensive snaps, so it wasn’t a full one-for-one swap.\nThat’s because Mayo is still working his way back from a torn patellar tendon in his knee, which happened a year ago Monday and features a far more grueling rehabilitation process than a torn ACL. He knows he can only control what he can control, and the knee won’t miraculously return to full strength overnight.\nMayo has recognized that since arriving in July for training camp.\n“Honestly, I just came in going to practice each and every day, trying to get better, trying to get my legs under me and see what happens from there,” Mayo said.\nThat hasn’t made it any less strange to see the Patriots defense operate with Mayo in a peripheral role. Mayo returned in 2014 from a season-ending injury and played 100 percent of the Pats’ snaps through five games, aside from the final series of a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4, before going down in Week 6. It’s not like his importance to the defense was a couple lifetimes ago.\nTo a degree, that involvement could return as early as this weekend if Hightower can’t go. Mayo has been the third linebacker on the depth chart this season, still ahead of Jonathan Freeny, and it seems unfathomable Jon Bostic would leapfrog Mayo one week after being a healthy scratch. But since Mayo isn’t ready to go wire to wire, it’s possible his reps could be supplemented by an extra safety against the Colts’ passing attack.\nThe Patriots have a heck of an insurance plan with Mayo coming off the bench this season. They’re in an even better position for it with Mayo handling an uncertain situation with so much certainty.\n“I just go out there,” Mayo said, “and prepare like I do each and every week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:24:13.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
