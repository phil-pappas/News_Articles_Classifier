In a game broadcast live on WDUN AM 550 , East Hall (3-4, 2-1 Region 7-AAA) will bring its multi-faceted offense, one scoring 33.3 points per game, to bear against a Franklin County (4-3, 3-1) team that has been both up and down, scoring 40 and 56 points in games but is averaging 27.4 points. \nElsewhere in 7-AAA, Dawson County (4-3, 3-1) and Banks County (5-2, 2-1) will tangle in a showdown broadcast live on northgeorgiasportslink.com. The Tigers are coming off their first region setback of the campaign at Fannin County, managing their lowest scoring output of the region campaign. Meanwhile, the Leopards have won two straight, putting up their two highest point totals in back-to-back contests. \nThe winners of each game will keep themselves at the front of the region title race. \nMeanwhile, both Gainesville and North Hall are battling for the postseason futures and each will do so in important region contests this Friday. \nThe Red Elephants (4-3, 4-2 Region 8- ) are coming off a shock, 44-7 loss at Clarke Central and will be desperate to avoid a third straight defeat when they play host to Cedar Shoals on Friday in a game broadcast live on 1240 AM ESPN Radio . \nThe Jaguars are just 1-6, 1-5 in 8- , but are a dangerous team, coming off a narrow, 30-25 defeat to Winder-Barrow in which they held a 25-10 fourth quarter lead. Gainesville will be looking to get its offense back on track after scoring just 15 total points in its last two games. \nIn Region 8-AAAA, North Hall (3-4, 2-2 Region 8-AAAA) can clinch a state playoff berth if it can close out the campaign with three straight wins -- the Trojans could reach the postseason even with a loss, but know that victories will most definitely clinch a berth -- the only question would be the seeding position. \nThe Trojans will travel to battle Monroe Area (2-5, 1-3) in a contest broadcast live on WDUN FM 102.9 . North Hall flashed some of its old wing-T prowess in last week’s 56-28 defeat of Madison County, rushing for 586 yards and the Trojans will look to keep that up this week. \nElsewhere in 8-AAAA, White County (1-6, 1-3) and Chestatee (0-7, 0-4) will face off looking to gain some late-season traction in a game broadcast live on wrwh.com. \nIt will be another big week, and we’ll be there both on air and here on AccessWDUN’s Friday Game Night page to keep you up to date. \nWEEK 9 HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL SCHEDULE, Oct. 23 Athens Christian at Lakeview Academy Banks County at Dawson County -- Radio: northgeorgiasportslink.com Cedar Shoals at Gainesville -- Radio: 1240 AM ESPN Radio Clarke Central at Winder-Barrow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:55:28.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
