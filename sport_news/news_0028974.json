A waterspout-turned-tornado traveled across the bridge and ripped a tractor-trailer to pieces, right on the road. Other drivers were terrified.\nRandall Leaver, 56, was inside the US Postal Service mail truck as a waterspout turned into a tornado, sweeping his truck up in the chaos. Mail flew away and the truck was damaged, but Leaver eventually walked away uninjured.\nA couple of dozen drivers suddenly stopped when they so the commotion.\n“I didn’t think it was anything except a bunch of birds at first, until I got closer,” said Kent Davis, a driver who saw it happen. “We were able to kind of spin around and turn around the opposite way and pull off to the rest area.”\nDavis said the whole thing lasted a matter of seconds, but it was on his mind all day.\n“That truck was probably no more than 50 yards in front of me when I realized what was going on and I stopped,” he said. “I’ve never been associated with a tornado or anything that close, but I feel bad for the guy in the truck, because that had to be really, really scary.”\nDavis said he tried to film the whole thing, but he panicked and dropped his phone when he saw the funnel was coming closer to him.\n“I was worried about just getting out of there,” he said.\nThe tornado also damaged a nearby construction site.\nCopyright 2015 WFLA via CNN.
