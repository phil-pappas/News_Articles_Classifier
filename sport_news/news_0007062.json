(Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) (JULIE BENNETT) Comments \nTim Horton was right. \nThe Auburn running backs coach wasn't sure when, but Kerryon Johnson, he said in August, would play multiple positions at some point as a true freshman. \nThe running back has done more than that five games into the season. He's Auburn's No. 1 option at Wildcat quarterback, providing the former Madison Academy star plenty of opportunities to use his speed to chew up big yards. \n\"That's something that he'll be very good at,\" Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said. \"He did versions of it in high school, so he's caught snaps before. He's comfortable with it. Obviously we have a lot of experience with that kind of stuff and we think he fits it very well.\" \nJohnson led the Tigers' offense in the Wildcat package six times in their 35-21 victory against San Jose State on Oct. 3. He carried the ball five times for 21 yards. \nJohnson has played no less than three positions this season at receiver running back and Wildcat quarterback. He made one mistake in the Wildcat as he improperly motioned a player over, which resulted in center Austin Golson snapping the ball. \n\"That's something that can't happen but I think now that we have a game under our belt it won't,\" Lashlee said. \nJohnson had five carries for 28 yards and three catches for 32 yards in a 17-9 loss to Mississippi State. \"He doesn't drop balls,\" Horton said in August. \nJohnson also has three kick returns for 98 yards -- all against LSU in a 45-21 loss in Week 3. \nJohnson and receiver Jason Smith, a former quarterback on the junior college and high school level, are taking snaps at Wildcat quarterback, quarterback Sean White said last week. Smith did not take a snap at Wildcat against San Jose State. For now, Johnson is Auburn's Mr. Wildcat. \n\"For the first game doing it, I thought he did a nice job and I think he'll get better and better at it,\" Lashlee said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:20:28.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
