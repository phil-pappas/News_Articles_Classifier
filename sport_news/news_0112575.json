In 14 NFL seasons, Randy Moss caught 156 touchdown passes and made seven Pro Bowls. So when the future Hall of Famer ranks the game's top wide receivers, most football fans listen. Moss shared his top five - it was actually six - during a FOX pregame show last week. Since the Giants and Cowboys both had representatives, here's his top 5:\n1a. Antonio Brown\n1b. Dez Bryant\n2. Julio Jones\n3. A.J. Green\n4. DeAndre Hopkins\n5. Odell Beckham Jr.\n2.) Expect to see rookie defensive back Byron Jones continue getting the majority of his work against tight ends. In the season opener, the Cowboys' first-round pick was often in coverage against Larry Donnell. New York's top receiving TE was held to three catches for 21 yards, his worst statistical performance through six games.\n\"He's going to play a lot of snaps,\" Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said Friday on 105.3 The Fan's Ben and Skin show [KRLD-FM]. \"I think the biggest thing about Byron is he's so versatile. He can play free safety, obviously the nickel back and we feel very comfortable putting him in there at corner. He's obviously a good matchup for us, especially when he's trying to cover some of these big tight ends. He's long, he's physical, he's strong and the game's certainly not too big for him.\n\"And the other thing he does very well is he's very smart and he can move to different positions on the defense as the game moves along. We're lucky to have him.\"\nDuring another interview on 105.3 The Fan earlier this week, former Cowboys Pro Bowl safety and soon-to-be Ring of Honor member Darren Woodson compared Jones to a young Devin McCourty. The Patriots safety made second-team All-Pro in 2010 and 2013. McCourty, a 2010 first-round pick, played cornerback early in his career.\n3.) On Sunday, Christine Michael is expected to receive his largest workload since joining the Cowboys. The former Texas A&M standout saw some first-team reps during the bye week. Up to this point, he's carried only twice in two games. Michael, a second-round pick by Seattle in 2013, recently shared his thoughts on what stands out about the Cowboys locker room.\n\"Just how well the guys get along,\" he said. \"Like I say, we're brothers around here, and it goes good. The guys welcome you, and it's been going well since I've been here.\"\n4.) Randy Gregory will make his return on Sunday. He only played 18 snaps in the season opener against the Giants before suffering a high ankle sprain. But he made an immediate impact, pressuring Eli Manning on three occasions. Gregory said earlier this week that he expects to pick up where he left off. Sunday's game will also mark the first time Gregory and Greg Hardy will play together in a regular season game.\n\"I would say we'll more feed off of each other,\" Gregory said. \"Having him out there that type of guy, has been in the league a lot, you know what he can do on the field, he's going to get his job done. That's one of the main things we talked about in the meetings [this week], setting up our rushes to kind of direct Eli the way that we want him to go. We know he likes to step up, so we worked on the little things like that.\"\n5.) With their full complement of pass rushers scheduled to be on the field at MetLife Stadium, Hardy, Gregory, Jeremy Mincey, DeMarcus Lawrence, Tyrone Crawford and Jack Crawford must take advantage of one-on-one matchups. Although Hardy will likely see the most double teams, he said this week that he's hoping and praying for one-on-one opportunities.\n\"The singles, you've got to win, guys like Randy or Lawrence or Ty (Crawford) and Jack,\" Cowboys defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli said. \"All these guys that suit up, they've got to win. They have to. It's all part of it. That's when you have a good rush, if you get a dominant rusher out there. But now it's incumbent on us to make sure you move him around a little bit too.\"\nSo that means some right end, left end and tackle for Hardy?\n\"You never know,\" Marinelli said. \"Never know. Might play safety deep, too.\"\n\"He's a tremendous talent,\" Giants offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo said. \"He can change the game in one play. He jumps off the football, is strong and long and plays with a nasty streak. So we got to make sure he's accounted for.\"\nDoes Hardy think sacks will be there for him against the Giants?\n\"Sacks are always coming,\" Hardy said. \"Period.\"\n6.) The Giants are certainly aware of what Hardy was able to do against Tom Brady and the Patriots. Beckham specifically mentioned noticing the Pro Bowl pass rusher while watching tape this week of the Cowboys.\n\"I did notice 76 was back and he was doing a phenomenal job at rushing the edge and creating havoc back there for Brady,\" he said.\nHardy also mentioned Beckham this week while giving his assessment of the Giants offense.\n\"They got the one-handed catching wonder,\" Hardy said, \"so it's going to be a good game.\"\n7.) Even if Cowboys cornerback Morris Claiborne isn't shadowing Beckham all over the field Sunday, he'll likely see a lot of time against the star receiver. Claiborne played well during his opportunities against Atlanta star receiver Julio Jones in Week 3.\n\"He can really play man,\" Marinelli said. \"He's a heck of a man player. But he's getting to be a very good guy in zone and all those things, so the more he practices, and he's been able to practice quite a bit right now, the better he's going to get.\"\n8.) Jason Witten didn't make much of an impact on the stat sheet [5 receptions, 33 yards] in Dallas' last game against the Patriots. New England head coach Bill Belichick game-planned to take the Pro Bowl tight end away with double coverage. With Dez Bryant not playing Sunday, expect the Giants to do the same.\n\"I think that just presents some favorable things that we've worked very hard on, especially during the bye, to put our guys in position for that,\" Cowboys offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said. \"Any time a guy draws attention like Jason, it's the ultimate sign of respect for him as a player. But No. 2, it's just saying, 'Hey, you other guys, the challenge is for you to make them pay for that.' So that's certainly our approach and we're excited about what that presents for us with some of these guys on getting singled up.\"\n9.) Of course, it will be critical for Witten and Matt Cassel to be on the same page in the QB's first start with the club. Here's what Witten had to say about building a rapport with Cassel the last couple of weeks.\n\"I think Matt's done a great job,\" Witten said. \"He's a natural, good leader. He feels comfortable and he's had a lot of experience in this league. He's just done a great job of preparing himself and getting himself ready. He does a great job communicating and trying to create a spark for our football team and our offense. We had two really good weeks.\"\n10.) Finally, here's Giants head coach Tom Coughlin summing up where he thinks the Cowboys are right now as a team.\n\" I think they're going up,\" he said. \"I think they played better, even though they lost to New England by that score, there's no question their defensive team played well. It was a very tight game for a long time. New England's defense did an outstanding job. The Cowboys played New England very well, to be honest with you.\n\"I thought they lined up and played them man-to-man, nose-to-nose, I got you, you got me, let's go. For the most part, they did a pretty good job. The Patriots were able to maneuver and got one of their big plays in the second half out of the wheel route out of the number three receiver. But it was certainly a good game, entertaining game to watch. So I think their defense has gained a couple of players and it's going to make them stronger.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @jonmachota", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jonmachota"], "published": "2015-10-25T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:27:58.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
