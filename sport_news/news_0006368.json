Now, 11 years later, he has the young Cubs in the NL Championship Series, eight wins away from their first title since 1908.\n“The 2003-04 ‘Idiots’ and the ‘Cowboy Up,’ carefree (attitude), that’s what this reminds me of, how loose it is, how they don’t have a care in the world,” Epstein said yesterday. “They just enjoy each other’s company, making each other crack up, coming out, raking, going back and laughing about it. It’s a very similar vibe.”\nOf course, the 2004 Red Sox were built much differently than these Cubs. The curse-busting Sox featured a veteran roster that was led by Manny Ramirez , Johnny Damon , David Ortiz , Jason Varitek , Pedro Martinez and Curt Schilling . The upstart Cubs are stocked with youngsters, from 25-year-old first baseman Anthony Rizzo to rookies Kris Bryant , Kyle Schwarber and Javier Baez .\nFor ace lefty Jon Lester , though, part of the attraction of signing with the Cubs was the allure of breaking a 106-year championship drought. Lester won World Series rings with the Sox in 2007 and 2013, but speaks enviously about the esteem with which the 2004 team is held throughout New England.\n“Those guys are legends in Boston,” said Lester, who will start Game 1. “I always use the comparison that Dave Roberts stole one base and this guy hasn’t paid for a meal or a drink since. I mean, it’s fun to think about, but we’ve got some games to go before we get there. At the end, maybe we can talk about it a little bit more.”\nBut there’s one other similarity. In 2004, the Red Sox’ road to the World Series ran through New York when they beat the Yankees in the ALCS. The Cubs will have to vanquish the Mets in order to get there.\n“It brings back some memories, having to go through New York,” Epstein said — on the 12th anniversary of Aaron Boone ’s Sox-killing homer in 2003, no less. “I love that feeling of coming into New York as the visiting team, being the enemy and walking around town and maybe getting a few knowing glances.”\nHarvey ready\nMets ace Matt Harvey is through talking about innings limits.\n“I think everybody’s kind of had enough talk and discussion about that whole ordeal,” said Harvey, the Mets’ Game 1 starter. “I’ll be the last person to ever bring that one up again.”\nHarvey’s workload has been a topic of great debate over the past few months. He missed last season while recovering from Tommy John elbow surgery and created a firestorm last month when he said he preferred not to exceed 180 innings. Including the postseason, he’s up to 1941⁄3.\n“I can understand a certain reservation on his part as he got closer to what some people felt was a large number,” Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said. “He got through that, and I think he has confidence now in his physical capacity, which is important for his mental approach.”\nAsked if Harvey will start more than one game in the series, manager Terry Collins answered, “Absolutely.”\nWaiting for Thor\nIn a perfect world, the Mets would have rookie Noah Syndergaard start Game 2 tomorrow night. But the hard-throwing right-hander might not be ready.\nSyndergaard, nicknamed “Thor” by teammates, threw 17 pitches in relief of starter Jacob deGrom in do-or-die Game 5 of the Division Series on Thursday night. He also threw more than 100 pitches while warming up four times in the bullpen.\n“He’s an animal,” Harvey said. “He loves the ball just as much as anybody. You kind of feel for a guy like that who has never really been in that situation and gets down, gets up. He came in and did a great job, like we knew he would. We’ll all excited to see what he can do next.”\nIf Syndergaard doesn’t have enough rest, he would be pushed to Game 4. Rookie lefty Steven Matz would start Game 2, with deGrom slated to start Game 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:37:27.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
