Forty-three shooters from Washington and Idaho converged on Wa-Hi’s rifle range to compete for honors and an invite to the national championship match, held in Fort Benning, Ga., in January. Precision Class rifle shooters fired a 60-shot match from the unsupported standing position, with Wa-Hi Cadet Staff Sergeant Daniel Enger winning with a score of 585 out of 600, beating out Spokane Rifle Club’s Katie Loudin by 12 points. “Daniel has done a phenomenal amount of work in preparation for this match,” said Wa-Hi coach Mark Mebes. “A 585 will likely put him in the top 5 shooters nationally by the time all of the qualifying matches are over. There are not a lot of high school riflemen that can produce an offhand score like that, and Daniel has been doing this consistently.” The Spokane Rifle Club’s Gold Team won the Precision team match with a score of 2,282 out of 2,400, beating out the Blue Devils by 17 points. In the Sporter Class, the match consisted of 20 shots fired prone, 20 shots standing and 20 shots from the kneeling position for a possible score of 600. The top score went to Wa-Hi Cadet Major Zachary Cobb with a 510. Blue Devil Cadet First Sergeant Sammantha Scott came in second place with a 504, and third went to Wa-Hi Cadet Staff Sergeant Thad Grimm, who fired a 485. Wa-Hi’s JROTC’s Sporter team won the match with a score of 1,972 out of ,2400 over Spokane. “These Sporter scores are significantly higher than we fired here last season,” said Mebes. “(Zachary) Cobb and (Sammantha) Scott have both competed before, but Grimm is a new addition to the team. It will be interesting to see how far they can go this year.” Regional qualifying matches are being held throughout the country as shooters try to receive an invitation to the national match in Georgia. “Currently, (Daniel) Enger’s score has him sitting in first place nationally,” said Mebes “There are still a lot of locations that have yet to turn in their scores, but I expect that he will likely receive an invitation to the national match when all is said and done. A 585 is going to cause some stir among collegiate coaches in this sport.” The Blue Devils’ next match takes them to Spokane on Oct. 31 to compete in the Washington State 3P Indoor Championship.
