A breakthrough, but only after one last lack of faith displayed, and one last dose of criticism leveled. As everyone knows by now, Dalton and the Bengals don’t win their glamour games. When the lights are the brightest, they wilt. When the stakes are the biggest, they come up small.\nThe whole narrative of underachievement that has surrounded this quarterback and this team for so long was heard again on Sunday afternoon, all within the course of a single game that absolutely ran the gamut from dejection to validation in the course of three-plus hours at Paul Brown Stadium. For most of the day, the doubts seemed richly deserved, and the fault-finding seemed to fit.\nWeek 5 coverage hub: All the news, highlights you may have missed\nBut in the end, it was all proven wrong. Dalton and the Bengals delivered this time, and instead it was Cincinnati’s past demons that came up empty. As statement games go, it was loud and clear: These are not the same old maddening Bengals. And Dalton, lo and behold, is suddenly a quarterback who can be counted on in crunch time. That much was apparent in the aftermath of Cincinnati’s thrilling 27–24 comeback victory over the visiting Seahawks in overtime, a game in which the Bengals trailed by 17 points entering the fourth quarter.\nThere are no playoff games played in Week 5, of course. But this was the kind of confidence-building victory that may wind up helping the Bengals avoid the dreaded wild-card round once they get to the playoffs, where they have dropped four consecutive first-round postseason games in the Dalton era. And this was the kind of game that could steel them come January, perhaps marking the beginning of the end of the Bengals’ can’t-win-the-big-one reputation.\nNFL Video Bengals prove again they're one of NFL's best teams in win over Seattle by Doug Farrar", "external_links": ["http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/si.html?mediaId=b0353450f96644fca80eeb17ac215fcc", "http://twitter.com/donbanks"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:27:06.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
