Snake River jumps West Side for second while Rigby and Skyline both reappear inside the top five. The top spot is a familiar position for the Tigers after spending six weeks as the highest-performing team in 2014 before stumbling down the stretch. With a bye week Friday night, the Tigers will finish the year with three-straight conference games, including a rematch of last season's 2A state championship against West Side.Biggest Gain: 8. Hillcrest (+6)Biggest Loss: 10. Highland (-5) Related Content Power Rankings 2015, Week 5 \nThe Hillcrest Knights made the biggest jump, picking up six spots with their 41-point victory over Idaho Falls on the road. Hillcrest had been stuck in the teens for most of the season because the 5A Knights had played all 4A teams until beginning conference play against the Tigers. On the other hand, Highland lost the most positioning, dropping from fifth to tenth after losing to CDA at Holt Arena. Rams fans have so much more to worry about than power rankings, though, as the team continues to support the Gwinn family. (If you're unaware of the situation, check out Julia Cox's piece about the Gwinns on localnews8.com.)Sports Line's power-rankings formula measures a team's total performance using win-loss record, point differential and strength of schedule. In 2014, the top five teams in SL's rankings all played their way into their respective state championship games. Three of those teams; Highland, Snake River and West Side, ultimately won their titles. Blackfoot and Aberdeen were the only two inside the top five to lose in the final weekend. \nThe American Falls Beavers haven't won three in a row since the very beginning of the 2012 season. Now, the Beavers have picked up three straight, and they have a bye week to rest and prepare for a showdown at defending 3A champion Snake River on October 9. But, two things are working against the Beavers in that game. Snake River has a bye this week as well, and the Panthers will have home field advantage.Looking ahead to Week 6 in Idaho, we have a few match-ups between top 10 teams as Rigby hosts Madison in an upper valley rivalry. And, Skyline travels across town to Hillcrest. These games are too close to call, and if you're looking for some offensive showcases, these four know how to score. Enjoy the games! \nCopyright 2015 NPG of Idaho . All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
