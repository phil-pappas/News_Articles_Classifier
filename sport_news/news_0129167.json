The airline apologized, credited passengers $50 and bused them to Worcester or directly to their homes.\n___\nInformation from: Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), http://www.telegram.com", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1VZVI5U"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:01:32.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
