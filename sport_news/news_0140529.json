Four days after ditching manager Brendan Rodgers following a year of mediocrity, the club has tied the knot with Jürgen Klopp.\nKlopp, who will sign a three-year deal at Liverpool, has been one of the most talked-about managers in Europe for at least three seasons. Though he has never coached outside Germany, his work at Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga, where he challenged the dominance of Bayern Munich, meant he could write his ticket to almost any club on the continent.\nIn the end, Liverpool picked him and he picked Liverpool, with all of its history, its devoted followers, and its rather forgettable start to the new season. The Reds have collected just 12 points from eight games.\nLast Sunday, the club fired Rodgers hours after a 1-1 draw with crosstown rival Everton. The decision, the team’s owners said in a statement, “provided us with the best opportunity for success on the pitch.”\nThey soon started making eyes at the modern darling of European soccer, the ungainly, bearded German from Stuttgart, who stepped down at Dortmund at the end of last season to take a sabbatical.\nHow exactly did Klopp become so sought after? The answer lies in this seven-step plan to becoming everyone’s favorite manager.\n1. Be Quotable (But Not Like Jose Mourinho)\nWho else would describe his team’s style of play as “heavy metal” or talk about crying with players when they left his club? Which other manager would openly discuss having a hair transplant? Klopp’s press conferences are famous for his honesty. That’s where he generates some of the best copy in soccer—in German, but also in his limited English. He also manages to do it without being obnoxious.\nIt’s a tough act to pull off. Mourinho, Chelsea’s famously surly coach, might have the sharpest tongue in the game, but his barbs are always at someone’s expense. (Usually Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger.) Take the time Mourinho goaded a reporter by saying: “I can guess that when you were a kid, you played badminton.” That’s not Klopp’s style. His most memorable remarks are usually his colorful analogies, like the time he said a new player fit his team as neatly as a “[backside] on a bucket.”\nENLARGE Borussia Dortmund's manager Jürgen Klopp laughs at a press conference in Dortmund, Germany.

In Germany, Klopp had the biggest, baddest one around: Bayern Munich, the New York Yankees of the Bundesliga. Klopp once compared the club to a James Bond villain.\nBayern sweeps up the best talent in Germany with the fattest budget—often right from Dortmund. In 2013, playmaker Mario Gotze made the move to Munich. In 2014, Robert Lewandowski, one of Europe’s most lethal strikers, followed. Bayern made Klopp’s life harder still by appointing former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola.\nYet Klopp was able to build a competitive Borussia Dortmund. He won back-to-back league titles in 2011 and 2012 and came within five minutes of beating Bayern in the 2013 Champions League final.\nOverall, in 22 competitive games against Bayern, Klopp’s Dortmund posted eight victories, four draws and 10 losses—which is a record to be admired considering that Bayern basically steamrolls everyone else.\nAt Liverpool, he’ll have Manchester United just 32 miles away from Anfield. Manchester City is just three miles farther, while crosstown rival Everton is located just across Liverpool’s Stanley Park. Klopp can take his pick of nemeses.\n3. Have a Distinct Look\nKlopp has frequently been described as a “hipster” manager, though he’s never actually been spotted making artisanal pickles or riding around the Ruhr valley on a fixie. It’s more accurate to say he’s got a beard and dark-rimmed glasses.\nEven that’s enough to set him apart from the parade of pudgy old men who prowl the sidelines of most major soccer clubs. Klopp, in other words, is the Joe Maddon of European soccer.\nPlus, the 48-year-old Klopp rarely wears a suit. He’s more of a track-pants-and-hoodie man, straight from the team store. The outfit he wore on the sideline against Arsenal in last season’s Champions League, for instance, will set you back a modest $142.\n4. Don’t Be Afraid to Freak Out\nENLARGE Dortmund's head coach Jürgen Klopp shouts to his team during the German Bundesliga soccer match between Borussia Dortmund and TSG Hoffenheim last December. Photo: Associated Press Fans love seeing a manager’s human side. And when Klopp freaks out, he really freaks out. At times, he can get so incensed by a referee’s decision that he looks unhinged. Unhinged enough to go viral.\n5. Invest in Young Players\nShepherding young talent through a club’s youth academy and into the starting lineup is always a risk. When they don’t pan out, the fans turn on you, demanding to know why you didn’t spend money on experience. If they do turn into world-beaters, richer clubs soon start sniffing around.\nThat never stopped Klopp. In the 2012 German Cup final, perhaps the defining match of his tenure at Dortmund, seven of the 11 starters that destroyed Bayern Munich 5-2 were 24 years old or younger. That bunch included future German national team regular Mats Hummels, Japanese playmaker Shinji Kagawa, and Poland’s Lewandowski. The Dortmund faithful adore Klopp for promoting them to the first team.\n6. Indulge Your Club With a Little PDA\nDortmund’s motto is “Echte Liebe,” a German phrase that means true, authentic love. Klopp was all about it during his seven years at the helm. He wept on a regular basis. He thanked the fans in the Yellow Wall stand—Dortmund’s answer to Liverpool’s famous Kop—after big wins. And when it came time for him to leave, the Yellow Wall thanked him back with a gigantic display that read “Danke Jürgen.”\nENLARGE Dortmund's teammates celebrate with their head coach Jürgen Klopp, top, after winning the German Championships in 2011.

So much goodwill, in fact, that the fans didn’t have many complaints when Dortmund finished 19 points adrift of Bayern in 2014. They didn’t even call for his head last season when the injury-addled club flirted with relegation last season before rallying for a seventh-place finish.\nThe cult of Klopp was worth a rough season or two. At least, that’s how Dortmund felt. Liverpool, in the rush-to-judgment Premier League, will probably make up its mind much sooner.\nWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR340_KLOPP2_M_20151008113825.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR340_KLOPP2_P_20151008113825.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR343_KLOPP3_M_20151008114434.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR343_KLOPP3_P_20151008114434.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR344_KLOPP4_P_20151008114935.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR344_KLOPP4_M_20151008114935.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:40:51.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
