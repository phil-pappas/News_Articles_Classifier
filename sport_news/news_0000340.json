You can’t deny it. But players and coaches, regardless of the past, you look at each game as a new challenge.”\nHogan might have grabbed the historical footnote, but it was Christian McCaffrey who proved to be UCLA’s undoing.\nMcCaffrey rushed for 243 yards and four touchdowns on 25 carries, setting a school single-game record by surpassing Toby Gerhart’s 223-yard effort against Oregon in 2009.\nThe jitterbug running back was electric from the get-go, picking up a 25-yard run on his first carry, then returning a kickoff 96 yards the second time he touched the ball to set up No.15 Stanford (5-1 overall, 4-0 Pac-12) for its second score.\nMcCaffrey, who entered the game ranked second in the FBS in all-purpose yards, posed problems all night for 18th-ranked UCLA (4-2, 1-2), finishing with 369 all-purpose yards before taking a seat early in the fourth quarter.\n“He’s a good running back,” UCLA defensive lineman Ken Clark said. “He runs hard and he runs behind those big guys. He found some open holes and hit them pretty good.”\nThe Bruins fell behind, 35-10, late in the second quarter.\nPenalties proved costly for UCLA early on. The Bruins were flagged six times in the first half, some of them stalling drives.\nWhen senior receiver Jordan Payton caught a short pass from freshman quarterback Josh Rosen to pick up a first down on the Bruins’ first drive, he was whistled for pass interference on a pick play, running into a defensive back to set another receiver free.\nThat left UCLA with a third-and-16 from its own 14-yard line. Rosen fired the ball toward the sideline, but his pass was underthrown and intercepted by cornerback Alijah Holder, who cut across the field and returned it 31 yards for a touchdown and an early 7-0 lead.\nOn UCLA’s second drive, the Bruins marched to the Stanford 10-yard line. The drive included a shifty run from Paul Perkins, who juked past several defenders, then cut across the field for a 43-yard gain. He appeared to score on a 10-yard run, but right tackle Caleb Benenoch was hit with an offside penalty.\n1 2 3 Next Page UCLA-Stanford highlights Related: VIDEO: UCLA-Stanford highlights UCLA-Stanford box score", "external_links": ["http://embed.pac-12.com/vod-mNRJYA4rGGE", "http://sports.ocregister.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510150063&home=63&vis=64", "http://pac-12.com/videos/highlights-stanford-football-christian-mccaffrey-have-record-night-win-over-ucla"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:24:35.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
