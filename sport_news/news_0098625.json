As far as he lets on, Saturdays double overtime victory over Oregon means no more than the ones over Wyoming and Rutgers - and the tone didn't change Monday. \n\"There's not all this big pictures stuff that's for you guys to do and a portion of that is why you guys aren't invited to our meetings,\" Leach said when asked about their latest signature win becoming a turning point of sorts for WSU. \nIt's yet to be seen whether WSU has in fact turned the proverbial corner. But for the players' sake they can point to a promising mile marker, and feel confident that progress has been made. \n\"Just showing what we can do when we rise up as a team together,\" quarterback Luke Falk said. \"Our biggest deal is just let's do it all four quarters instead of certain spots of the game and I think if we do that we're gonna be one heck of a team to mess with.\" \n\"I really think that we could do some big things here,\" linebacker Peyton Pelluer added. \"I think this Saturday was definitely a step towards that direction.\" \n\"We all came together as a team and just said enough of this crap, it's time to win it's time to do what we came here to do and that's win get this program back on the right track,\" Falk said. \"Since we hadn't beat those guys in a while I think it meant a lot for the fan base and stuff so I think it was a good overall win for our program and we need to forget that one and move on.\" \nUp next is Oregon State Saturday at 1:00 p.m. in Martin Stadium. Their two Pac-12 games this season have resulted in a 42-24 loss to Stanford and a 44-7 defeat at Arizona over the weekend. \n\"We're not in a position to be taking anyone lightly given the type of season that we've had,\" wideout Gabe Marks said. \"Every week it's like coming down to the wire for some reason.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.krem.com/1RDzUMH TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:53:31.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
