The film chronicles the unsung heroes of sports, the wives of coaches, and the joys and struggles of being married to a coach. A local screening was held at Vanguard University’s Lyceum Theater in Costa Mesa on Saturday, October 10, where more than 150 were in attendance, including local coaches and their wives who were featured in the film.\nThe documentary showcases the coach’s wife as the backbone of the family and the team, often serving as mother to the players, managing a hectic schedule and unruly fans. When a coach’s family is constantly in the public eye, like Jeanie Buss, wife of Phil Jackson of the Los Angeles Lakers, the coach’s wife brings normalcy to an often-chaotic lifestyle.\n“As the son of a coach's wife, I have always known how important a woman is to her coaching husband,” said Jonathan Moore, producer and director of the feature-length documentary film. “No matter what level the sport is, professional, college, high school or below, coaches' wives all experience the same joys and challenges. It's a sorority, a sisterhood. This film will show that.”\nMoore is also associate professor of cinema arts at Vanguard University. His wife, Karen Moore, who also produced, directed, and edited the film, is associate director and editor of Last Call with Carson Daly on NBC. Director of photography for Coaches’ Wives, Kyo Edmoundson, is a graduate of the communication department at Vanguard University.\nThe film includes Jeanie Buss (Los Angeles Lakers), Meo Stansbury (Texas A&M), Kathy Auriemma (Univ. of Connecticut) and Mindy Rice (UNLV). Numerous coaches’ wives at the middle school, high school and small college level are also featured, including Neezer McNab (Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High School), and Daniela Olson (Manhattan Beach, Mira Costa High School).\nCoaches’ Wives will hold screenings all across the U.S., including screenings in Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Oregon. With nearly 100,000 plays on the online trailer, the LA Times recently said, “Coaches’ wives are as dedicated and determined as the coaches themselves.”\nView the extended film trailer here: http://www.CoachesWivesDoc.com\nFind Coaches’ Wives on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CoachesWivesDoc\nFind Coaches’ Wives on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/CoachesWivesDoc\nAbout Vanguard University\nVanguard University (VU) is a regionally ranked, private, Christian university of liberal arts and professional studies.
