It was more of an epiphany.\n“I was watching a feature on the Discovery Channel one night about the gazelle,” he said. “It showed how the gazelle continually has to deal with lions, hyenas and other predators coming up on it from all sides, but because of its speed, the gazelle almost always is going to win those battles.\n“It got me thinking that since we’ve got this gazelle in Michael, we’d be best suited to put him in a position to use all of this speed. He was a dangerous receiver, but specific things have to happen to get a guy the ball in that role. My offensive coordinator and I put our heads together to look for a magical equation to build an offense around his skills and so far — with help in other areas — it has worked like a charm.”\nJohnson, a 6-foot-3, 200-pounder who has been timed in 4.4 seconds for the 40-yard dash, is off to an amazing start. Through five games, he has an area-high 1,489 yards and averaging an eye-popping 12 yards a carry, with 17 touchdowns in leading the Red Raiders to a 4-1 record.\nLondon, which is coming off successive 2-8 seasons and hasn’t won more than six games since 2000, is averaging 44.8 points a game.\n“You need more than one guy for this to work or people will just load the box all night long,” Cutler said. “We got our offensive line in sync and we’ve devised a scheme in which we run to set up the big pass play.\n“As for Michael, we know he can do special things, but we never really imagined this. He definitely has the attributes to be a Division I player, but he got into the process so late, it’s going to be a challenge to find the right place for him. He’s the ultimate late bloomer.”\nThe Red Raiders’ first-year offensive coordinator is Darrell Mayne, who coached Upper Arlington from 1998 to 2004. In 2000, he guided the 15-0 Golden Bears to a Division I state title with a running back, Jeff Backes, who rushed for 3,353 yards, fourth-best in Ohio history.\nInjury report DeSales defensive back/running back Austin Andrews likely will miss three or four more games because of a torn knee ligament suffered in week four against Hartley, coach Ryan Wiggins said. The Michigan State recruit had 378 yards and five touchdowns and was a stellar returner. ... Dublin Coffman quarterback Gunnar Hoak sat out his team’s 56-7 rout of Marysville last week because of a sprained ankle but is expected back tonight.\nSquib kicks Westland (4-1) is averaging 272 yards rushing on a robust 8.1-yards per carry. ...

Columbus Academy sophomore receiver Jerome Buckner has 703 yards on just 37 rushes, receptions and kickoff and punt returns (a 19-yard average) with eight touchdowns.
