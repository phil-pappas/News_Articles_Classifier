Robbie Gould showed again why he has been one of the NFL's most accurate in his 11 seasons. His third field goal, from 49 yards out with two seconds left, assured the Bears of not going 0-16.\nQuarterback\n3½ footballs\nThe pick-prone QB showed up midway through the fourth quarter, and the red-zone INT resulted in a Raiders field goal. Otherwise, great game for No. 6, whose hammy couldn't have been 100 percent.\nRunning backs\n3 footballs\nMatt Forte continues to play great football. He rushed for 91 yards and caught 4 passes, including a big 38-yarder.\nReceivers\n3 footballs\nThe Raiders couldn't handle Martellus Bennett, who was targeted 13 times and caught a season-high 11 passes, including a TD. The wide receiver-challenged Bears need to keep throwing to their talented tight end. Nice game from Eddie Royal (7 catches, first TD as a Bear).\nOffensive line\n2½ footballs\nCenter Will Montgomery limped off early after suffering a broken left fibula. That's not good for a team that starts Mr. False Start, Vladimir Ducasse. Props to veteran guard Matt Slauson for filling in creditably for Montgomery.\nDefensive line\n3 footballs\nA Bears' high-draft pick made a play, as Eddie Goldman notched his first NFL sack. Jarvis Jenkins got his career-high third sack and third in two games. Run defense was stout.\nLinebackers\n2 footballs\nAside from Pernell McPhee (gift interception, TFL), there's nothing exciting going on here with this group.\nDefensive backs\n2½ footballs\nWell, there were no pass-interference penalties or blatantly blown assignments. Have to give the rookie Amari Cooper credit for his in-stride, 26-yard catch deep in the end zone.\nSpecial teams\n3 footballs\nRobbie. Gould. Plus, the opposing kick returners were held off the scoreboard. That's progress.\nCoaches\n3½ footballs\nAdam Gase put together an offensive game plan that worked, targeting the Raiders' inability to cover crossing routes. John Fox is too good of a head coach to start 0-4, even with a roster short on talent.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
