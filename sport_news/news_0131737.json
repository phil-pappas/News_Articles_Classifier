After wrapping up the win over Vekic, Hibino shook her head in disbelief and waved to supporters. \nVekic, who is ranked 137th after a disappointing season, drops to 1-3 in career WTA finals, with her last win coming at the 2014 Malaysian Open. It was her second appearance in a Tashkent final after losing in 2012 to Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania in straight sets. \nEarlier Saturday, the Russian duo of Margarita Gasparyan and Alexandra Panova won the doubles final 6-1, 3-6, 10-3 against Russia’s Vera Dushevina and Czech player Katerina Siniakova.
