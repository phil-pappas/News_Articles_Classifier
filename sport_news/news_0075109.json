With three victories this season, it is only one region win away from achieving this mark.Senior defensive back/running back Ryan Durham has led the charge with seven interceptions, which is tied for the third most by a player in the country. He has also been a contributor on the offensive end, rushing for 132 yards along with a rushing and receiving touchdown each this season.“Ryan is a standout academic student whose grade point average is near the top of his grade,” head coach David Rosenzweig said. “He is an active member in our service organizations and as a team captain has been instrumental in leading the Cougars this fall. On the field, his ball awareness, speed and ability to set up the defense are his best gifts.”Durham is proud of the team’s accomplishments at this point of the season.“We’ve had a good season and doing much better than previous years,” he said. “We’ve been productive on both sides of the ball and united as a team. We’re confident with where we are and looking forward to possibly making the playoffs.”Durham also credits his teammates and coaches for the individual success he’s achieved this year. “The defensive strategy by the coaches has been good as well as the linebackers and defensive line making it possible for me to be free and pick off the ball,” he said. “I like playing on both sides of the ball and don’t like sitting on the sidelines.”Pushing for a postseason spot has energized the Cougars.“We’re excited and want to bring the program into the playoffs,” Durham said. Off the field, Durham is a member of the Delta Omega service fraternity at the school and also plays on the soccer team. He’s also a part of St. Joseph’s Cohort, a service organization which build homes for the less fortunate, and the school’s mentoring program.Durham lists AP European history, economics and calculus as his favorite classes and plans to pursue a career as an entrepreneur.
