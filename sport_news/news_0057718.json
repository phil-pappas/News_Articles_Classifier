Both are public health issues affecting millions of women and families around the world. Neither of them discriminates.\nThere is no preparedness training for losing a child. In the natural order of things, no parent expects their child will die before they do. But, unfortunately, they do. When you lose a child and a grandchild at the same time that is unthinkable.\nFor Linda Young, the death of her daughter and grandson on April\n16, 2005 changed her live forever when Linda’s son-in-law choked her 23 year old daughter to death. Christi was 8 months pregnant when her husband choked her to death. He then suffocated her 11-month-old grandson and lived in the house with them for 6 days. But, the battle was just beginning.\nLinda said, “When I flew home to bury my family, I was told I couldn’t. The Next of Kin Law in Kentucky and Indiana stated that because my daughter was married to the man who murdered her, even though he had already confessed, he was her next of kin. We had to go to the county jail where he was being held for trial and get his permission to bury my family…In total outrage, my family and friends wrote to senators, legislators and lawmakers in both states.”\nLinda founded a program, Angels@Work in 2005. Angels@Work made it their mission to have amendments made to the Next of Kin Law in both Kentucky and Indiana, which they succeeded in doing.\nThe National Coalition Against Domestic Violence website has some surprising information to share about domestic violence.\nEvery 9 seconds in the US, a woman is assaulted or beaten. 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men have been victims of [some form of] physical violence by an intimate partner within their lifetime. 1 in 5 women and 1 in 7 men have been victims of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. On a typical day, there are more than 20,000 phone calls placed to domestic violence hotlines nationwide. The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of homicide by 500%. Intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime. Women between the ages of 18-24 are most commonly abused by an intimate partner. 19% of domestic violence involves a weapon. Only 34% of people who are injured by intimate partners receive medical care for their injuries. One statistic that is not mentioned very frequently is that while most domestic violence is men against women, there are men who are also victims of domestic violence.\nAs Linda told me, “You always think it happens somewhere else, to someone else. You never think it’s going to happen to you…I never realized just how often it happens…If we can help save one life, my family did not die in vain… Angels@Work is dedicated to educating people in the warning signs and behavior patterns of potential perpetrators.”\nBe an angel and \"Brighten impoverished lives by displaying a Light of Hope wherever you are on November 7, 2015 at 6pm Eastern Time, It can be a porch light, candle, cell phone, or flashlight.
