The guys are chomping at the bit. They’re ready to play someone other than ourselves.” \nYCC, a tiny Christian school on the west end of Billings, decided a few years ago to add athletics in an attempt to gain exposure and increase enrollment. Men’s basketball will be the first program off the ground. \nAnd the Centurions won’t start lightly. They will play a full schedule in their first season, opening against a Rocky program with tradition. The Bears won the 2009 NAIA national championship. \nYCC was accepted in June as a provisional member of the National Christian College Athletic Association. It gives the school an athletic affiliation and a region to call home as it begins college sports. \n“I came here in general, to Billings, Montana, to make this something special,” said Epps, a native of Louisville, Ky. “We want the community to be involved. We don’t want to play a soft schedule. We’d like to have a rivalry with Rocky and play every year. \n“We don’t want to be a team Rocky gets to warm up against. We have a lot of respect for them and I think they do for us. We’re taking this game as serious as we’ll take any game. I think we have a shot.” \nEpps, who played college basketball at York College in Nebraska, said his team will be uptempo, pressing on defense and getting shots up quickly. \nHis team is young, so he said they'll lean on transfers Keegan Oyugi and Darius Jenkins on and off the court. Oyugi, a point guard, came from Garden City Community College in Kansas, and Jenkins transferred from York. \nEpps also said freshman Osondu Kelvin, a 6-foot-9 center and native of Nigeria, should be one of the team’s top players. \n“We have a lot of talent, but we’re young,” Epps said. “That talent should keep us in a lot of games against some of the better competition we’ll face early. I’d look for us to make some noise down the road.” \nWhile it’s the first game for YCC, the Bears already have played twice. They picked up two wins over the weekend at the Craig Finberg Memorial Tournament in Dillon.
