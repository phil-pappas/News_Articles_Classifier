I had fun.\"\nDespite the loss, Lillard earned Most Valuable Player honors, joining Steve Blake (2007 and 2009) as the only Blazer to win Fan Fest MVP twice. Lillard, who also won MVP in 2014, finished with nine points, two rebounds and three assists.\nThe scrimmage itself was sloppy and fittingly ended with the failed lob pass to Lillard leading to a missed windmill-dunk attempt from Harkless as the buzzer sounded.\n\"It got a little ragged at times,\" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of the 24-minute, running clock exhibition that lasted 49 minutes and featured 15 turnovers and 54 missed shots.\n\"It's always difficult when you play against yourself because when you do something well that means something probably was not so well on the other side,\" Stotts said.\nThe most poetic moment of the game happened prior to tip-off. As the Blazers were taking the court for the first time the franchise's two key figures led the team out of the tunnel. President of Basketball Operations Neil Olshey, the man who re-shaped the roster during the offseason, walked in front of the players closely followed by Lillard, the franchise cornerstone around whom Olshey built the roster. The move was likely unintentional but it was a fitting introduction for this iteration of the Blazers.\nHere are four takeaways from the Blazers first action at the Moda Center of the 2015-16 season.\nPortland Trail Blazers Take To Court At Fan Fest The Portland Trail Blazers took to the court before playing a nearly 50 minute infra-squad scrimmage at the team's 2015 Fan Fest at the Moda Center.\nOh for three\nStotts has said his team won't give up on three-point attempts despite a perceived lack of pure shooters on the roster, but Fan Fest wasn't a shining example of the Blazers perimeter arsenal. The Black and White teams combined to shoot 0 for 21 from beyond the three-point line.\n\"It means they're going to be raining tomorrow,\" Stotts said, adding that he considered tonight's shooting woes 'an outlier.'\nNew-look offense looks like the old one\nFor all the speculation about how the Blazers might switch up the offense with a brand new roster this season there were still a lot of familiar sets. The Blazers ran a flare-screen set , that became a staple way to free up Wesley Matthews for three-pointers in the last few seasons, several times during Fan Fest. Crabbe and McCollum both got chances to run off back screens near the top of the three-point arc, a familiar sight that figures to stay part of the offense.\nLeonard not afraid to dribble\nMeyers Leonard is going to get a lot more attention on the perimeter this season and if Fan Fest is any indication he's working on putting the ball on floor when defenders close out on him. On three separate occasions, Leonard passed up a contested three-point attempt to pump fake and drive towards the rim. He found teammates on two occassion and took an elbow jumper on the third. None of the three resulted in points, but it's something worth keeping on eye on when watching the Blazers fourth-year big man this season.\nAminu left early, Kaman sits out\nAl-Farouq Aminu was in the arena earlier in the evening, but left around 6 p.m. when he found out his wife, Helina, had gone into labor. Aminu had been in \"any-day-now\" watch for a few days as the couple's first child was expected on Oct. 1 . The Blazers had not received any update from the family as of 9 p.m.\nVeteran center sat out Fan Fest with \"a variety of things,\" according to Stotts. While there wasn't an official injury update it sounds like the Blazers were holding out the 33-year-old, 13-year vet for precautionary reasons. Cliff Alexander (left knee) and Gerald Henderson (hip) also sat out.\nNext up\nThe Blazers start their preseason schedule Monday night against the Sacramento Kings at 7 p.m. at the Moda Center.\n-- Mike Richman\nmrichman@oregonian.com\n@ mikegrich", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0nzCXQdaw", "https://twitter.com/mikegrich/"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:20:28.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
