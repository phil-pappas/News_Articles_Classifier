Panthers hope to avoid 0-2 district start 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nOne loss in district play won't eliminate a team from postseason play. But two will make a coach sweat. \nThat's the scenario Ozen coach David Suggs and his Panthers hope to avoid at 7 p.m. today when they play host to perennial 22-5A champion Nederland (2-2, 1-0). \nThe Panthers (2-2, 0-1) have not started district play with two losses since the 2008 season, when they finished 3-6 overall and failed to qualify for the playoffs. \n\"It's not impossible, but for us to put us in a 0-2 position is really going to be a tough battle going forward,\" said Suggs, who is in his second-year as head coach for the Panthers. \"This will be a big ball game for us and if we can get a win, it will be a big momentum boost towards our goal of going back to the playoffs.\" \nOzen understands the need to play with a sense of urgency this week according to Suggs. \n\"They started practice Monday with a new sense of urgency,\" Suggs said. \"They've really thought about what kind of team they want to be and they've put a lot into these practices.\" \nWhile Suggs said he's \"too old to be nervous,\" a slight concern must be given to the vastly improved district that Ozen finished fourth in last season. \nThe bottom four teams in last year's District 22-5A – Lumberton, Vidor, Goose Creek and Lee – have combined to win seven games thus far, only two less than all of last season. The Raiders (4-0) have made the biggest push, entering Week 6 with a perfect 4-0 record, including a 51-29 win over Ozen in the district-opener. \n\"This district is very good top to bottom,\" Suggs said. \"In Lumberton there is a lot of excitement, team building and belief around their new system. I was not surprised at all about how well they played against us.\" \nDespite the success of Calvin Tyler Jr. last week, who rushed for four touchdowns and 185 yards against Lumberton, Suggs expects his team to be more balanced on offense. \n\"We really want to be balanced and take whatever is given to us by the defense,\" Suggs said, On defense, we just have to play a whole lot better than last week. We are going to simplify things. Less thinking and more reacting to the ball.\" \nTyler Jr is ready for his Panthers to show what they are made of. \n\"That game (against Lumberton) showed us where we are and where we need to improve,\" Tyler Jr. said. \"We need to still become a whole team. Once we work together the whole game, it's going to be hard to stop us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:00:33.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
