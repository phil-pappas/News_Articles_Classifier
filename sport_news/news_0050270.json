Pablo Montagnes, now at Emory University in Atlanta, analyzed records from 1960 to 2012. They reasoned that if the football effect is real, it should also produce certain other outcomes. But it didn't.\nFor example, no influence from football wins appeared in years when a county's voters faced multiple election races that had different incumbent parties. Nor was it especially strong in counties where citizens care the most about college football, as measured by Facebook \"likes.\" Nor was it stronger when the incumbent was up for re-election than when the seat was open.\nAnd the researchers found no local effect of wins by NFL teams.\nBut Stanford University political scientist Neil Malhotra, an author of the 2010 study, said the new analyses weren't appropriate for testing whether the original results were a fluke.\nThey simply show that the football effect \"is not something that happens all the time, in every circumstance,\" he said.\n___\nOnline:\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: http://www.pnas.org \n___\nMalcolm Ritter can be followed at http://twitter.com/malcolmritter \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
