The starts.\nHe won three of his first eight games in 2013. He won two of his first seven and nine of his first 24 the next season. He won seven of his first 15 last season.\nLundqvist was aware of it, but just in case, coach Alain Vigneault reminded him with a challenge.\n“It was hard not to (think of it) when AV left me with the message,” Lundqvist said Saturday after a spectacular 5-2 win over Columbus that his him and the Rangers 3-0 after three games in four nights.\n“The last thing he told me before I went back to Sweden was ‘you have to be better when we start.’ That stayed with me the entire summer and coming back to camp. With Benny (goaltenders coach Benoit Allaire), we put out a good plan to be as ready as I could be and I felt like I was in a good phase when we started playing.\n“It’s only three games, but I also felt playing the exhibition games, I felt like my focus was better. I spent more time this year, this camp, to prepare mentally, which has helped me. It’s a big part of my game when I play — my focus. Sometimes it takes me a little bit to get there, but I think I pushed myself to get there faster this year.”\nThe benefit, of course, would be a better start for the Rangers, who haven’t gotten out of the gate fast in two seasons under Vigneault, the fiery coach who also has a bit of an unknown in new backup goalie Antti Raanta, the replacement for traded Cam Talbot.\n“I kind of agree (with Vigneault),” Lundqvist said. “The last few years, it hasn’t been great, for different reasons. But you see it as a great challenge for me to come back and be ready. Also, my second half has been a lot better for most years, and if I can be steady all year, I think it’s going to help me, it’s going to help the team. So that was my challenge this year, to try and play at a higher level, reach my level, as soon as I could.”\nHe and Allaire — dubbed “The Goalie Whisperer” by former Rangers captain and current radio/TV analyst Dave Maloney — spent the late part of the summer and the preseason working on his mental focus. Lundqvist only appeared in three preseason games (a very strong 2-0, 2.25, .933) and concerned himself more with his practices and his fundamentals.\n“He’s certainly been our best player since the start of the season,” Vigneault said. “You got to give full credit to Benoit Allaire. He got a plan together, we discussed it with Hank and obviously he’s playing the way he’s playing right now. The plan is falling into place.”\nSaturday in the home opener, Lundqvist (37 saves) had to be sensational at times, and was. Especially on a simple dump in on which Lundqvist went behind the net to routinely play the puck, only to have it take a weird hop off the wall, hit the side of the cage and carom to Columbus’ best player, Ryan Johansen, in front of the vacated net.\nLundqvist lunged and, just as Johansen shot, got his stick, then his blocker, on the puck, which fluttered away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:31:09.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
