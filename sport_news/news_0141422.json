He has a strategic mind that can tweak and adjust as the game flows; talagang virtual time adjustment.” \nSalud adds: “He ought to be hired long-term for a long-term program.” \nShould the pool be in place, depending on the kind of players the SBP and the PBA will agree on, it will then be “protected, reinforced and replenished” with pros as the competition requires, says the PBA top brass. \n“Mas madali kesa sa pick-up system, di ba? Tapos dadgag na lang yung ating naturalized player,” says Salud, who also believes the SBP was on the right track with its Cadet program years ago. \n“They planted the seeds back then. Who did they have na nagbunga na? [Marcio] Lassiter, [Chris] Lutz, Japeth [Aguilar], [Greg] Slaughter], [Mark] Barroca, right?” he says. “So idadagdag na lang, halimbawa, sina Paul Lee and [Junemar] Fajardo, even Calvin [Abueva]. Maganda sana kung maituloy yon.” \nHe clarifies though: “I’m not saying it’s the only way however. But it’s perhaps something they can consider to start the ball rolling. Kasi we can’t repeat the same system over and over again and expect a different result, di ba? Pagod na yung mga fans sa silver. We want to look ahead and hurdle the silver block. We want a gold medal finish.” \nWith the format changes FIBA is set to implement starting 2017, which will see quarterly tournaments instead of one big regional meet for Asia, Salud says devising a new system in forming the national team has become even more imperative. \nQuarterly FIBA tournaments would mean quarterly disruptions in the PBA season if the country’s top players are again to be recruited for international duty, a situation Salud doubts would be tenable to pro teams. \n“Given this, I believe now is the time to talk about it,” Salud says. “And we’re waiting for them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:11:31.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
