He also claims he was prejudiced because three former Penn State administrators awaiting trial on alleged cover-up charges weren't available to testify at his trial. \nThe attorney general's office already has filed a response calling the appeal \"baseless.\" \nSandusky is serving 30 to 60 years for his conviction on more than 40 child-sex abuse charges. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:57:21.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
