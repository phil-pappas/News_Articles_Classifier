Here's the \"honor roll\" from Saturday's 31-24 loss to Michigan State .\nHEAD OF THE CLASS\n1. Defensive coordinator Joe Rossi\nThis was the game plan everyone was waiting for. Rossi dialed up creative blitzes to keep pressure on Michigan State quarterback Connor Cook all night.\nThe Scarlet Knights only had one sack, but they had eight quarterback hurries and it seemed like even more. The aggressive approach also had players swarming to the ball against the run, limiting the Spartans to 3.5 yards per carry.\nRossi deserves credit for the game plan, but the players made the schemes work. Linebacker Quentin Gause (10 tackles, two tackles for loss) was a monster against the run, while linebacker Steve Longa (nine tackles, one sack) made plays that extended beyond his typical high tackle total.\nRedshirt freshman Kiy Hester (seven tackles, one interception) should own the starting strong safety job as he continues to be a playmaker in the place of the injured Davon Jacobs. Defensive end Kemoko Turay and nose tackle Sebastian Joseph made an impact that didn't show up in the box score.\nThe bottom line is Michigan State scored 31 points, gained 489 yards and came through in crunch time. But there were obvious signs of progress on defense and this aggressive approach should yield better results against other opponents.\n2. Wide receiver Leonte Carroo\nCarroo didn't miss a beat after his suspension, catching seven passes for 134 yards and three touchdowns in his return . He simply takes the team to another level, as he was the best player on the field on Saturday night. Carroo's impact against Michigan State should keep hope alive that Rutgers can sniff a bowl berth with games against weaker opponents ahead.\nThe Spartans made the mistake of trying to single-cover Carroo and he made them pay. The jolting thing about watching Carroo compared to other receivers is just how open he was on some of his catches. He's just a physically dominant player that presents a mismatch for most defensive backs.\nRELATED: 10 takeaways from Rutgers' loss to Michigan State\n3. Quarterback Chris Laviano\nIt wasn't a perfect performance by a long shot. The botched end-of-game scenario has been covered extensively , and there were also two sloppy fumbles — on a snap and a handoff — that he was lucky to recover. The team continues to burn timeouts because of play clock and personnel issues, although some of that can be expected from a first-year starter.\nAnyways, there were plenty of positives on Saturday. Laviano was more assertive than he had been and he wasn't afraid to throw downfield (both of those can at least partly be attributed to Carroo's presence). His first touchdown pass to Carroo in the back of the end zone was the best throw he's made all season.\nThere weren't any head-scratching decisions by Laviano, who completed 15-of-24 passes for 208 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. His best play of the night was a scramble to pick up a first down on Rutgers' game-tying drive in the fourth quarter. The Knights had third down deep in their own territory and Laviano slipped out of a sack and ran five yards, diving for the first down to keep the drive alive.\nBACK OF THE CLASS\n1. Clock management\nInterim coach Norries Wilson, offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels, suspended head coach Kyle Flood, Laviano, the other offensive players, the scoreboard operator, the chain crew ... pretty much everyone but the popcorn vendor has been blamed for the debacle at the end of the game when Laviano took a sack on third down and then spiked the ball on fourth down in an attempt to stop the clock.\nThe odds of completing a Hail Mary from midfield with players scrambling back to the line with three seconds left were obviously slim. But that doesn't excuse a complete lack of awareness by seemingly all involved.\nAnd long before the poor clock management at the end of the game, the Knights continued their habit of burning timeouts. Rutgers got the ball with 1:06 remaining in the first half and, with only one timeout, had no choice but to sit on its lead heading into the break. And the Knights used two timeouts before crunch time in the second half because the play clock was expiring and/or they had a personnel issue.\n2. Right tackle J.J. Denman\nRight tackle is one of the biggest concerns on the team right now, especially with a bevy of strong pass rushers on the schedule ahead. Denman just doesn't seem to move well laterally, which leaves him susceptible to speed rushers.\nDenman got an earful from Wilson after getting beat for a sack on third down in the second quarter and Michigan State consistently generated pressure off the right edge. Rutgers is going to need to give Denman help from a tight end and running back more often going forward.\n3. Pass coverage\nThe pass coverage is in the back of the class, but it's more like a C- than an F. And with so many young players in the secondary, the unit should be graded on a curve.\nThe coverage was definitely improved, as Michigan State didn't have nearly as many receivers running open in the middle of the defense as previous opponents. And the tackling in the secondary was much more solid after the catch.\nBut Division 1 football is a results business and the bottom line is Michigan State had 357 yards passing and converted 11-of-17 third downs. Cook made some spectacular throws and his receivers made some great catches. Rutgers' defensive backs were in position; the next step will be making plays in those spots.\nFans clamor for defensive backs to turn and find the ball, but that's the not the technique that is taught. In man-to-man coverage, the defensive backs keep their eyes on the man and play the ball through the receiver's hands.\nThere are clearly signs of progress and one can only imagine what the secondary would look like if so many veterans didn't get kicked off the team before the season started.\nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com .
