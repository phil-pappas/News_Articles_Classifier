It would be great if we could go a long way in the competition. \n\"We've got a very good group of players. We've got some really fantastic players in this squad and with the strength of the squad that we've got it is very, very important that we do go far in the competition. It will be a great season if we could manage that.\" \nCity led in their last home game against Juve but familiar European failings appeared to be returning as they went on to lose and then fell behind in Monchengladbach. \nBut Martin Demichelis claimed an equaliser and a last-minute penalty from Sergio Aguero - who City must now manage without due to injury - got their challenge up and running. \nNavas said: \"I think when you pick up your first set of three points it's good news for the team and I think now as a group it's going to give us lots of confidence going into the rest of the group stage fixtures. I hope we are going pick up lots more sets of three points along the way.\" \nNavas enjoyed 10 years in the Sevilla first team after coming through their junior ranks. His early career was shaped by homesickness to such an extent that it curtailed his international prospects and limited his involvement in participation. For a long time he did not condsider leaving Seville but now he feels well settled in Manchester having made more than 100 appearances for City. \nHe said: \"I am very happy and very proud at the same time. I would say that from the first day that I got here I have been treated really, really well. People have accepted me and given me confidence. It's great.\" \nLike City, Sevilla also have three points after beating Monchengladbach but losing to Juve. They have never before played City and have not won on three previous visits to England. \nBut they boast strong recent European pedigree having won the Europa League for the past two seasons and, together with its predecessor the UEFA Cup, four times in the past 10 years.
