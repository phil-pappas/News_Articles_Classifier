And while Weddle is not having one of his best seasons, his presence at safety enables his teammates to take risks they otherwise might not.\nStill, Jason Verrett said, the Chargers have to realize they’ll have to do without the 30-year-old Weddle at some point.\n“Of course we want him out there with us, but at the same time we don’t know how long he’s going to play,” Verrett said. “We can’t act as if he’s going to play forever and we can’t execute with the guys who are out there (in his place).\n“It’s going to come down to the players on the field stepping up and making plays.”\nRAIDERS TURNING POINT? \nWhile the Chargers see their season start to slip away, the Raiders are 3-3 and playing with confidence.\n“That’s reassurance that if we just do our job and don’t go outside of the framework or try to do too much, then that’s what we can do,” Raiders quarterback Derek Carr said. “I believe we have a good football team, and today we came out, listened to (head coach Jack Del Rio) and did our job. Nothing much more, nothing less.”\nSAY WHAT? \nChargers coach Mike McCoy said he didn’t think there were any communication issues caused by the noise generated by Raiders fans, but there was at least one play definitely influenced by the noise level.\nOn a fourth-and-1 at the Oakland 23-yard line near the end of the first quarter, the Chargers acted as if they were going to go for it, with Philip Rivers hoping to use a hard count and get the Raiders to jump offside. But with Raider fans roaring, Rivers couldn’t get the defenders to jump and ultimately called timeout, and Josh Lambo came on to kick a 40-yard field goal.\nETC. \nChargers guard Orlando Franklin, in his first game back after missing three games with an ankle injury, hurt his left knee in the fourth quarter and was taken off on a cart … Next for the Chargers: Sunday at Baltimore. The Ravens (1-5) play Atlanta on Monday .\nContact the writer: jalexander@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:11:58.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
