The Act dedicates 80 percent of any federal Clean Water Act civil penalties imposed because of Deepwater Horizon to the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund. The purpose of the trust fund is to help address the environmental and economic impacts of the spill in the five Gulf Coast states — Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The council created by the RESTORE Act is chaired by the secretary of commerce and includes representatives from five other federal agencies and designees from the five Gulf States. The Texas governor appointed Commissioner Toby Baker as his designee to the federal council. The Texas governor also created the Texas RESTORE Act Advisory Board to oversee the state’s efforts. Commissioner Baker and the Governor’s Office will focus on the Texas RESTORE-related plans but will generally carry out the goals from the RESTORE Act.” (www.restorethetexascoast.org)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:00:46.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
