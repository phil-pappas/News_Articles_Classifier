If O'Leary announces he is stepping down now, it will allow him to go out with some dignity; without irate fans demanding his ouster and without more airplanes flying over the stadium dragging \"Fire O'Leary\" banners. Why do you think Steve Spurrier retired at midseason at South Carolina? Because he didn't want the end of his tenure as the greatest coach in South Carolina history to turn ugly at the end of a miserable season. \nUnfortunately for UCF, it's already turned ugly and miserable. But, at least if O'Leary announces his retirement decision now, it will soothe the angry mob, douse the flaming pitchforks and give UCF fans a chance to honor and appreciate all O'Leary has done for the program. He deserves to be celebrated, not castigated, on his way out the door. \nIt's a shame he has to go out like this, but, unfortunately, that's just the way it is in coaching. What's the line from the movie Cocktail? …\"It always ends badly otherwise it wouldn't end.\" \nJust ask Bobby Bowden or Joe Paterno or Tom Landry or Don Shula. \nIt's not as if O'Leary doesn't know the end is here. You can just tell by the way he talks, telling concerned fans at a booster luncheon recently \"you\" will be fine in the future. It's a sure sign when a coach starts referring to the program as \"you\" and not \"we.\" \nIt's also a sign when O'Leary says he is concerned about being a recruiting liability. \"Kids want to know if you're going to be around for four or five years,\" O'Leary told me last week. \"That will be a major factor in my decision.\" \nIt's also a sign when you look up to see a mostly empty stadium even though it's homecoming and you're playing the No. 21 team in the nation. Or when look out on the field and your team is giving up 52 unanswered points after leading 10-7 late in the second quarter. Or when you look at the NCAA statistics and your team is one of only four winless teams in the country along with North Texas, New Mexico State and Kansas. \nIn a conference that has four teams ranked among the top 10 in the nation in total offense (Houston, Memphis, Cincinnati and Tulsa), UCF is ranked dead last — 127 out of 127. \nLast week, UCF moved defensive coordinator Chuck Bresnahan out of the press box and onto the field. This week, offensive coordinator Brent Key moved out of the press box and onto the field. Next week maybe O'Leary will move off the field and into the press box. \nDoesn't really matter, does it? Nothing is working. Nothing is going to work. \nThe only thing left to do now is to meet with President Hitt and let everybody know what we already know: \nThe greatest coach in UCF history is stepping down for the good of the program. \nmbianchi@orlandosentinel.com .
