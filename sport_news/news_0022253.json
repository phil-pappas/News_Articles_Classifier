Her boys started crying, and that was when she started capturing video of the incident, reports KPIX .\nWARNING: The audio is graphic.\n\"People offered to help me cover my twins [sic] ears,\" she wrote on Facebook . \"Others threw there [sic] stuff down and walked out. Employees were running around everywhere. Picking and hanging up phones, which worked....for about two minutes before it started up again.\"\nShe said it was \"terribly awkward.\"\nOther shoppers said they felt the same way.\n\"I felt violated, and my body said wait a minute, this ain't right. So I was uneasy,\" shopper Chris Minor told KPIX . \"I thought it may have been Halloween related, maybe an employee playing games, but this was rated-X material, which made me feel very uncomfortable.\"\nTarget told KPIX it's reviewing the situation to better understand what happened and ensure it will never happen again.\nMinor said the store apologized over the PA system, and then the explicit recording started again.\nA manager also apologized personally to Minor, but he said Target should have more safeguards. “To me that’s not enough, that’s too egregious of an event to have people experience, especially your regular shoppers,” Minor said.\nA similar incident reportedly took place at a Target store in San Luis Obispo in July.\nCopyright 2015 WWBT NBC12 .\nReport an Error or Submit a Tip to NBC12", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14BWEDBAaIV_WiyxfhZW0ocJHmzHB5SRFvIQ2Fe0mXKE/viewform", "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/14/shoppers-shocked-by-x-rated-audio-playing-over-target-stores-pa-system-in-san-jose/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvGBQ9bev2k?wmode=transparent&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=1", "http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2015/07/10/3716867_porn-target-audio-pa-system.html?rh=1", "https://www.facebook.com/gina.bond/videos/vb.709099834/10153802579429835/?type=2&theater", "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qWmYsErhR6ISeZ2udl36bqFtUyAayWz94m67tk9Ivl8/viewform", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvGBQ9bev2k", "http://nbc12.com/"], "published": "2015-10-16T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:07:25.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
