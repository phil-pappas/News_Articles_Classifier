I’m sure he spoke to his players and staff about getting back to basics. \n“They should have won the game. They should have had a penalty. Talk about the positives instead of the referee. You get bored of it. \nThe players get fed up and bored of it. There are positives: they played really well, couple of clean sheets in a row, they’re starting to get back to their best and they should have won. \n'Instead, the manager again, and there is a lot of negativity around the place.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:36:32.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
