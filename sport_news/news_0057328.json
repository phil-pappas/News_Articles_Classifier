Yes, the Los Angeles Dodgers may have two of the three best pitchers in the National League, but they also have to deal with him.\nA day after the Chicago Cubs’ Jake Arrieta overwhelmed the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League wild-card game, the prospect of Dodgers co-aces Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke similarly dominating the New York Mets looms over this NL Division Series.\nNot so fast, Cespedes said.\n:To me, they’re pitchers like any others,\" Cespedes said in Spanish. \"Everybody knows how good they are, but they still have to throw it down there just like they all do.\"\nUSA TODAY\nDodgers' Clayton Kershaw to start Game 1 of NLDS\nWhile Kershaw and Greinke combined to go 2-0 with an 0.90 ERA in four starts against the Mets this season, all those games took place before a July 31 trade that sent Cespedes to New York. His arrival, combined with David Wright’s return and the contributions of late-July acquisitions Kelly Johnson and Juan Uribe, helped transform the meekest offense in the NL into the most potent one.\nCespedes hit 17 homers and drove in 44 runs in 57 games with the Mets, and his presence took pressure off other hitters in the lineup. That didn’t surprise Johnson, who was Cespedes’ teammate with the Boston Red Sox for a month last season.\n\"I told our general manager, Sandy Alderson, when it happened how excited I was for us to get this guy, because I knew the impact he could have and how special he was,\" Johnson said. \"Not a lot of people in the game can do what he can do. He’s a throwback talent. He does a lot of things every day to change games.\"\nCespedes, an impending free agent, embraces the extra attention and excitement that comes with playoff baseball. He hit .350 in 10 postseason games with the Oakland Athletics in 2012 and 2013, and said his teams in Cuba made the playoffs seven out of his eight seasons there.\n\"I like the ruckus (at the ballpark),\" he said. \"When there’s a lot of ruckus, my concentration goes to a higher level to where I can’t get distracted, because I can’t hear anything else.\"\nGALLERY: BEST MOMENTS OF THE POSTSEASON\nALDS Game 1: Rangers vs. Blue Jays - Rougned Odor (right) celebrates with Delino DeShields after hitting a solo home run in the 7th inning to give the Rangers a deciding 5-3 lead.
