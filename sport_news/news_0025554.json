Weeden has lost all three starts in place of Tony Romo and 11 consecutive NFL starts.\nDallas Cowboys Passing Performance Per Game in 2015 | PointAfter\nWithout Romo (broken collarbone) or the deep-threat potential from wide receiver Dez Bryant, who's expected to return in the coming weeks from a broken right foot, the running game has struggled mightily, especially on first down. Neither Joseph Randle nor Darren McFadden has successfully filled the void left by DeMarco Murray, last year’s NFL rushing leader who departed for the Philadelphia Eagles. Christine Michael has had limited opportunities, as well.\nWhat’s more, the team is devoid of consistent playmakers in the passing game, especially when teams double cover tight end Jason Witten. The loss of versatile running back/pass catcher Lance Dunbar, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament in an overtime loss against the New Orleans Saints, was significant.\nAs for receivers, Terrance Williams has struggled to fill the shoes of Bryant as the top receiver. Garrett said, overall, the receivers have struggled at times to win individual battles.\nCassel, who served as Weeden’s backup against the Patriots, is more accomplished than Weeden, having led the Patriots to 10 wins after Tom Brady was lost for the season in 2008. Cassel also led the Kansas City Chiefs to the AFC West title in 2010.\nBut the offensive issues clearly run deeper than one position in Dallas. And the team is unlikely to see a significant boost offensively until Romo and Bryant return.\nAs owner Jerry Jones wondered after the loss to the Patriots: Will it be too late by that point? The team badly needs a few victories before Romo can return Nov. 22. They had no choice but to turn to Cassel.\nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/EricPrisbell", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/i00ImeLaHxr", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://nfl-teams.pointafter.com/l/3/Dallas-Cowboys"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:19:49.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
