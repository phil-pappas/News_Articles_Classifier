Oct. 18, 2015 2:52 p.m. Search by team or game Or click for... \nGreen Bay — It's only fitting that as the San Diego Chargers make their once-a-decade visit to Lambeau Field, thoughts would turn to their greatest player. \nRIP, Junior Seau. You were one of a kind. \nFrom football's Valhalla, Seau would enjoy this comparison. Before his death, by a self-inflicted gunshot wound in May 2012, he would have taken notice of the Green Bay Packers player that will confront his Chargers late Sunday afternoon. \nThe way No. 52, linebacker Clay Matthews, is playing the game is the way No. 55, linebacker Junior Seau, played the game. \nThey never met. Matthews, USC class of 2009, couldn't recall Seau, a Trojan 20 years earlier, coming by to watch practice. \nGrowing up in California, Matthews didn't spend every Sunday watching the NFL. He has seen Seau's highlights, of course, but never studied him. \n\"I didn't watch enough of his film to say this is how we resemble each other,\" Matthews said last week. \"You obviously see something. For me, that's already an honor in its own right. \n\"Obviously, he was an amazing football player, a first-ballot Hall of Famer. To tell you what we do in common, I'd be lying if I said we do this or that.\" \nEven though Seau played 268 games for three teams during a 20-year career, just four games were against the Packers. \nIn those games, it was hard to take your eyes off him. \nMatthews said the one word that came to his mind regarding Seau was tenacity. Mine would be ferocious. \nRemember those early-season games at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium (later Qualcomm Stadium) before the Padres' season was over? As the infield dirt kicked up and the beast in the No. 55 jersey got a lather going, visions of Seau cruising around the field, alternately shattering or flinging down quarterbacks, ball carriers, blockers, receivers, remain vivid. \nAnyone in his path felt the very ruthlessness, the fury of his charge. \nNow see Matthews, the way he physically dismisses unfortunate opponents that fall within his grasp. Trashing, punishing, intimidating. So much like Seau. \n\"I'll take that, yeah,\" said Matthews. \"Hey, I've got a job to do. If you're getting in the way, so be it.\" \nThere was a penetrating look in Seau's eyes that was at once maniacal, threatening, a little otherworldly. \nYou see all of that in Matthews, too, and sometimes a hint of a sneer as well. \nDress football up any way you please. On defense, it still comes down to kicking butt. When a team's most-gifted defender is willing to sell out snap after snap, year after year, you have a player of priceless value. \n\"I don't know much about Junior Seau, but Clay Matthews is a great player,\" said Ron Wolf, the former general manager of the Packers. \"There's absolutely no question about that. I think he's a cinch Hall of Famer if he stays well. \n\"The way he's playing this year ... he's in that Lawrence Taylor group with Ted Hendricks. The type of guy that when a play needs to be made he'll make the play. He takes over a ball game. His dad never did that. You have to worry about where he is every play.\" \nDale Lindsey would know about Seau. He was Seau's position coach in his third through seventh seasons (1992-'96) before returning as his defensive coordinator in '02, which was Seau's final year in San Diego. \n\"The two best players I've ever been around, coaching-wise, were Junior and (Brian) Urlacher,\" said Lindsey, a nine-year linebacker for the Cleveland Browns whose 19-year career as an NFL assistant included Urlacher's first two seasons in Chicago. \n\"Junior was ungodly strong. Tremendous big, strong hands. Very, very explosive and powerful. Fast, quick. He had all the things the rest of us wished we had. His genetics were out of this world.\" \nBorn in American Samoa, Seau didn't move to the mainland until early elementary school and did not speak English until age 7. \nMuch like Matthews, his career at USC wasn't typical for a player destined to become an all-time great. \nHis first year, he was a Proposition 48 academic casualty. His second year, he was a backup. His third year, he had 19 sacks playing as much defensive end as linebacker. His fourth year he relinquished to enter the draft. \nDick Corrick, who lined up the draft in Green Bay under Bart Starr and Forrest Gregg from 1977-'86, attended Seau's pro day in Los Angeles in March 1990. \nIn his report, Corrick recorded Seau's height (6 feet 2¼ inches), weight (238), 40 time (4.66), vertical jump (34¾), broad jump (10-7), bench press (24) and Wonderlic intelligence test score (21). \nCorrick, then director of college scouting for the Houston Oilers, gave Seau a grade of 7.2 out of nine, which reflected a future Pro Bowl player (he was voted to 11 Pro Bowls). \n\"Has throw-off strength, pure speed, some nasty,\" Corrick wrote in his report. \"Fine body control and real ease of movement. Great kid. Eager and cooperative.\" \nChargers general manager Bobby Beathard drafted Seau with the fifth selection. After a long holdout, he played almost as much from a three-point stance early on as he did standing up. \n\"We started with him early in '92 trying to make him a third-down right defensive end,\" said Lindsey, who coached linebackers in Green Bay from 1986-'87 and currently is head coach at the University of San Diego. \n\"George O'Leary, the D-line coach, didn't see Junior as the kind of guy that was going to do what we needed done at end. We put him back in the nickel as a backer behind the line, and the rest is history.\" \nPlaying primarily weak-side linebacker in a 4-3 defense, Seau was remembered by two executives from AFC West teams as overly aggressive at times. \n\"Early on, the knock on him was he just played on instincts,\" one of the personnel men said. \"Never studied. Just flew by the seat of his pants. That wasn't true. \n\"But when he was on the field sometimes he came unglued because he played with his hair on fire. He got out of control at times. It wasn't because of not being prepared or not knowing what he was doing.\" \nBy the mid-1990s, Seau's thirst for football knowledge and incredible work/study habits allowed him to become a student of the game. \n\"A lot of people thought Junior was a freelancer and a guesser,\" Lindsey said. \"That was not really true. The guy could just do things other people couldn't do.\" \nSeau played between 250 and 255 pounds, according to Lindsey, and had body fat between 5% and 10%. He practiced each day at fever pitch. Lindsey said safety Rodney Harrison told him the reason he was able to play 15 years was being taught the right way by Seau. \n\"There's always guys on a team that drive the team,\" said Lindsey, who still watches the NFL. \"They set the standard for the rest of the people. \n\"Junior was the primary force driving this team to win. I'd say, looking over the last five, six years, that's the same thing you see from Clay Matthews. \n\"He is a hell of an impact player the same way Junior was, and I think he has the same type of leadership.\" \nSmall and underdeveloped, Matthews had to walk on at USC. In his fifth year, he finally got a chance to start in Game 4. \nAt the combine, scouts recorded Matthews' height (6-31/8), weight (240), 40 (4.66), vertical jump (35½), broad jump (10-1), bench press (23) and Wonderlic (27). At USC pro day, he ran 4.57. He weighs 253 now. \nWithin a month Matthews was starting at outside linebacker in the Packers' 3-4 defense. \nFive days before that first start, 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said of Matthews, \"When it's all said and done, they will find out that Matthews is a better fit inside.\" \nMatthews exploded on the scene, immediately becoming the Packers' finest pass rusher. Dom Capers insists Matthews, not Troy Polamalu, should have been defensive player of the year in 2010. \nHe had been voted to four Pro Bowls and selected all-pro twice when, saddled with the league's poorest run defense through eight games last season, coach Mike McCarthy made the stunning position switch of Matthews to weak inside linebacker in the base defense. \nHad Matthews remained outside, no comparison could be made with Seau. Now it can. \n\"The guy plays just like 55,\" said LeRoy Butler, the Packers' all-pro safety who entered the league with Seau in 1990. \"Fifty-five would be one of the top five inside backers of all time, and Clay Matthews reminds me of this guy.\" \nAt the Pro Bowl one year, Seau convinced Butler to start acting upon his instincts and thereby make more plays. According to Butler, Seau told him his No. 1 asset was timing. \nThe more Matthews becomes comfortable stacked off the ball, Butler sees timing that he once saw from Seau. \n\"To have that ability you've got to have something inside of you that's ticking and telling you what the next move is,\" said Packers tight ends coach Jerry Fontenot, a 16-year NFL center who had to deal with Seau blitzing the A gap in four games. \n\"Between those two, their anticipation of the snap count is phenomenal. They had different antennas.\" \nNot unlike Seau, Matthews' creative genius takes him out of some plays. At the same time, his cunning allows him to correct the scheme and make things right. \n\"Nobody can block him,\" Butler said. \"Even when they block him, he's not blocked.\" \nAnother parallel is temperament. Easygoing off the field, both men chase like hungry dogs on the field. \nMatthews' edge rush ability is superior to Seau, who wasn't big enough to bull rush and struggled maneuvering past tackles. \nIt should be obvious that Seau had few peers as a stack linebacker. Entering the seasons of 1993 to 2001, the late Joel Buchsbaum of Pro Football Weekly ranked Seau all nine times as the NFL's best player at his position. Matthews' highest rank was No. 2 outside in 2014. \nRight now, it's possible Matthews would rank among the top three or four players at both inside linebacker and outside linebacker. That's how well he has played in the first five games. \n\"They're not even close as rushers,\" said one longtime NFL executive in personnel. \"But believe me, and this is not a slight of Matthews, he has a long way to go to get to the level Seau is at. You're talking about one of the greatest ever.\" \nMatthews, a player without a flaw of any significance in his overall game, should have years left to become even more dominant and stand alongside Seau in the pantheon of linebackers.
