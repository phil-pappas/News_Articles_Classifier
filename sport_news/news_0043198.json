[We didn't] play quite as clean as I had hoped, but we've done a better job this year of not letting the score get them down and battling back,\" Trinity Christian head coach Chad Shelabarger said. \"I'm proud of them for playing tough no matter the situation.\"The win comes just 24 hours after the Warriors lost a tough match to Desert Heights, 3-1.DeCarlo, a junior, added two assists to her stat total and said after the match she was proud of her team's performance.\"We started off a little rough, then in the second game we picked it up,\" DeCarlo said. \"Then, in the third and fourth game, we still won, but we could have played a little bit better, but I'm proud of my team.\"Trinity Christian was out-played in game one by the Panthers, which won 25-19 thanks to some solid play by senior outside hitter Rebekah Winters. But the Warriors were able to recover and win game two, 25-13, to tie the series at 1-1.\"[Rebekah Winters], she can jump like crazy, and she's able to help shutdown their outside hitter [DeCarlo], so that briefly helped us where we got the timing on our blocks,\" Tri-City head coach Karen McGrane said. \"The timing on [Rebekah's] blocks has greatly improved this season and she was able to shut down their hard hitters, and they have a couple of them.\"In game three, Trinity Christian [13-3 Overall, Canyon Athletic Association Section III] led 20-15 before the Panthers were forced to call a timeout, but it didn't help and the Warriors used a 5-2 run to take the game, 25-17.In game four, both teams were unwilling to give. Tied at 14-14, a DeCarlo kill gave the Warriors capped a 5-1 run to take a 19-15 lead. Winters would lead Tri-City back, however, and capped an 8-4 run with a kill of her own to tie it, 23-23.DeCarlo would have the last laugh, however, as her 14th kill of the afternoon gave Trinity Christian a 25-23 win in game four and a 3-1 series victory.\"She is very aggressive, has an excellent approach. She had some hitting errors but when she's on it, it is very tough to dig,\" Shelabarger said. \"We rely on her a lot to score.\"Other standouts for Trinity Christian include junior Emily Ferrier with 22 digs, four kills and two ace serves while senior Emily Roth had 10 digs, seven kills and five ace serves.\"This gives our team a lot of confidence, because we're going up against good teams ... sectionals and state,\" said DeCarlo, who leads a Trinity Christian team that is now 2-0 against Tri-City this season after a 3-1 win on Sept. 22. \"This will definitely help keep our attitudes up and be confident.\"McGrane said despite her squad's loss, she was impressed with how her group played together.\"We've come a long way. We started off with six new varsity players this year and in a short amount of time that we've been going this season, they've really improved,\" McGrane said about her Tri-City team, which is 8-4 overall this season. \"They [are coming] together as a team.\"Next up, Trinity Christian will play its third match in as many days as they host Pan-American tonight at 6 p.m. The Warriors wrap up the 2015 regular season against Paradise Valley Christian [9-2 Overall, CAA Section II] at home on Tuesday, Oct. 20.
