We found that influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of influenza pneumonia that required hospitalization,\" he said.\nIn the United States, annual flu epidemics send more than 200,000 people to the hospital and kill as many as 49,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe leading cause of these hospitalizations and deaths is not flu itself, but pneumonia, which is a common complication of flu, according to Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\"The flu is a great enabler,\" Siegel said. \"It enables heart disease, pneumonia, appendicitis, sore throats and earaches.\"\nAnd pneumonia is the number one cause of hospitalization and death, he added.\nSiegel pointed out that the study didn't prove that getting a flu shot also prevents pneumonia, but only shows that most people who had flu-related pneumonia hadn't been vaccinated.\nTo prove a cause-and-effect relationship, researchers would have to assign one group of people to receive flu vaccines and another group to not receive flu vaccines. The rates of hospitalization for flu-related pneumonia in both groups would then have to be compared, he explained.\n\"This study raises the prospect that the flu shot decreases the risk of getting pneumonia,\" Siegel said. \"I'm buying that -- but it's not proof.\"\nBut it is possible that the flu shot offers protection from pneumonia, Siegel added.\n\"People may get some protection they are not even counting on,\" he said. \"You may get added protection against the real killer -- pneumonia.\"\nAll Americans over the age of 6 months should be vaccinated each year against the flu, the CDC recommends.\nMore information\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on the flu ", "external_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/flu/", "http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:18:14.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
