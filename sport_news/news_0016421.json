Scrolling down the list of quarterbacks ranked by fantasy points through five weeks, you’ll notice a few surprises, at least a couple of names you never would’ve expected to see so high up. Then one name becomes conspicuously absent near the top.\nWhere is Peyton Manning?\nYou’ll notice guys like Tyrod Taylor, Blake Bortles and Josh McCown in and around the top 10. A strange sight, isn’t it? Keep scrolling and you’ll pass names like Colin Kaepernick, Jameis Winston, Derek Carr, Sam Bradford, Marcus Mariota, Kirk Cousins and Ryan Tannehill before you finally arrive at Manning, ranked 23rd among quarterbacks through more than a quarter of the NFL season.\nManning failed to break double-digit fantasy points in each of the last two games and is on pace to score fewer than 200 fantasy points (standard scoring) in a season for the first time in his career. There were signs toward the end of last season that a decline could be coming; he averaged 9.6 fantasy points per game over the final five weeks. Still, Manning was regarded as one of the top quarterbacks heading into drafts, the belief being that his arm would hold up at least until the home stretch.\nAt this point, you must have a legitimate alternative at quarterback if you’re going to stay competitive the rest of the season, one where Manning might not even break 4,000 yards or 25 touchdowns.\nIf you took the risk of drafting Manning seriously, you likely stocked yourself with a quality backup. If you didn’t, you hopefully have been active on the waiver wire. And if you haven’t, you better act quickly.\nGuys like Taylor, Bortles and McCown should already be owned, with McCown probably being scooped up a bunch this week. McCown has tough matchups coming up but the Browns are airing it out.\nKaepernick has looked terrible at times, but his rushing ability makes him an intriguing option.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nBradford has turned the corner a bit the last two weeks and may soon become reliable if he can stay healthy. Cousins will be getting DeSean Jackson back, but that’s not enough of a boost for us to trust him.\nOtherwise, maybe you have a trade chip you can use to acquire another quarterback. Whatever you do, don’t count on Manning to suddenly regain his old form. His days as a fantasy stud are over.\nIt’s time for Plan B.\nQB Andy Dalton, Bengals\nThe top fantasy QB is remarkably cheap this week: 12th-most expensive on FanDuel and 14th on Draft-Kings of non-Thursday participants.
