It is the ideal environment not for football, but for the 'game' around football,\" he said. \n\"You can work there with the right amount of pressure and with the necessary detachment and calm. Before I retire, I'd like to have another experience in England.\" \nHe added: \"The vacation continues at least until the end of the year, then I'll start again. \n\"Where will I go? Where they call me. I will talk, evaluate and then decide. Up until a few weeks ago I was scared someone would call, but now the return is getting closer. \n\"Unless something strange happens. I am ready to get back on the bike in January.\" \nAsked who he thought would win the Premier League this season, he said: \"Manchester City because they have the strongest team, they have exceptional quality.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:07:46.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
