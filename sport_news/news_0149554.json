This one for all the marbles, for country, for personal pride.\nThe Philippines takes on China today at 8:30 p.m. for the FIBA Asia Championship after the two teams dispatched their respective semifinal rivals last night.\nChina was the first to the finals, dashing the title retention hopes of Iran, 70-57. Then the Philippines followed suit, dispatching a game Japan, 81-70, in which the outcome was never certain until Gilas Pilipinas uncorked a crippling salvo in the final three minutes that finally sapped the fight from the Japanese.\nThe Philippines is in the finals for the second straight FIBA Asia tournament. But unlike in 2013 when the tournament was held in Manila and Gilas was clear underdogs to Iran, the team now fighting for the title is deemed to have a chance although the Filipinos will still be the underdogs.\nChina has been unbeaten in the tournament, winning all its seven games convincingly. And its conquest of Iran was comprehensive. Then consider the crowd behind them – robust, noisy, unrelenting and totally infuriating for the opposing teams.\nPhoto by FIBA ASIA (http://www.fiba.com/asia/2015/0210/Japan-Philippines)\nThe stakes are sky high. Though the last two survivors had to go through the wringer the past 10 days in quest of Asian glory, the Asian title will seem like a mere consolation prize.\nThe real jewel is the trip to the Rio Olympics which goes to the winner of this tournament.\nChina has been in the Olympics several times but this one will be special for the Philippines whose last trip was in the Munich Olympics in 1972.\n“It’s gonna be a big game, it’s going to be a dogfight. I know the guys over there, they’re a good team,” said Gilas naturalized center Andray Blatche, who also plays professional in this country as a member of the Xinjiang Flying Tigers in the Chinese Basketball Association.\n“We need to play with a lot of heart,” he added.\nGilas will attempt to give the country its sixth Asian crown and the first since 1985 when the Northern Consolidated-backed squad led by naturalized players Dennis Still and Jeff Moore and homegrown stars Allan Caidic, Samboy Lim and Hector Calma hoisted the title in Kuala Lumpur.\nIronically, that team beat China at the conclusion of the four-team, single-round finals to clinch the title, which the latest batch of national team cagers will try to pull off tonight.\n“We didn’t come here to be in the Finals, we came here to win the gold,” said Gilas Coach Tab Baldwin, whose Jordan team narrowly lost to China, 70-69, in the 2011 FIBA Asia final in Wuhan.\nVeteran Dondon Hontiveros finally broke out of a shooting slump when it mattered most, nailing 6-of-9 triples to finish with 18 points. His last triple gave the Philippines a 77-68 lead with 1:22 left that ended the Japanese threat.\n“Lahat ng pinaghirapan naaalala ko, lahat ng sacrifices. Nung nakuha ko na yung rhythm ko, alam ko nan a maganda yung magiging performance,” said Hontiveros, who averaged just 6.9 points entering the semis.\nPhoto by FIBA ASIA (http://www.fiba.com/asia/2015/0210/Japan-Philippines)\nBlatche had another solid game for Gilas with 22 points and 13 rebounds even as Jayson Castro continued his strong performance in the tournament with 20 points and seven assists.\nGilas beat Japan for the second time in the tournament. The two teams met in the second round with the Nationals prevailing, 73-66.\nBut the second meeting proved to be harder than expected for Gilas as Japan guard Makoto Hiejima caught fire by scoring 22 of his 28 points during the first half that saw Japan leading for most of the way before settling for a 39-all standoff at the half.\nCastro led an onslaught in the third and Gilas took command, 54-46, at one point during the period. But careless plays allowed Japan to score eight unanswered to tie the knot at 54-all entering the final 10 minutes.\nThat set the stage for Hontiveros, Castro, Blatche and company to take charge.\nPHILIPPINES 81 – Blatche 22, Castro 20, Hontiveros 18, De ocampo 8, Abueva 6, Romeo 3, Pingris 2, Norwood 2, Ganuelas 0, Thoss 0.\nJapan 70 – Hiejima 28, Takeuchi 18, Tabuse 9, Ota 5, Furukawa 4, Arao 3, Tanaka 2, Hirose 1, Hashimoto 0, Matsui 0, Ono 0.\nQuarters: 16-17, 39-39, 54-54, 81-70.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true", "http://www.fiba.com/asia/2015/0210/Japan-Philippines)"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:03:11.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
