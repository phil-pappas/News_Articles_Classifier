ARKANSAS (1-2, 0-0) 6 p.m Saturday at AT&T Stadium (ESPN)\nCOLLEGE STATION -- Texas A&M athletic director Eric Hyman said he hears the question often from Aggie supporters.\nWhen will A&M's annual series with SEC West rival Arkansas leave Arlington's AT&T Stadium and return to College Station and Fayetteville? A&M just celebrated the $485-million makeover of on-campus Kyle Field on Sept. 12. The No. 14 Aggies (3-0) play the Razorbacks (1-2) on Saturday in JerryWorld.\nA&M, Arkansas and the Dallas Cowboys have a contract that runs through 2024.\n\"I'm constantly re-evaluating,\" Hyman said Tuesday. \"Circumstances may change two, three, four, five years from now.\"\nArkansas athletic director Jeff Long emphasized that the Hogs are all-in on playing in Arlington.\n\"We have 10 more games in the series, including this year,\" Long said. \"We have a contract through 2024. We are excited about it, and we expect it to continue.\"\nHyman underlined how much the backdrop of the game has changed since the original 10-year deal from 2009-2018 was announced in early 2008, with an addendum added in 2012.\nThe update was necessary because A&M left the Big 12 and joined Arkansas in the SEC West.\nThat would've been hard to imagine when former athletic director Bill Byrne, former A&M coach Mike Sherman, former Arkansas coach Bobby Petrino and Long posed for pictures in hard hats and orange vests in the still under-construction stadium. The original deal, Hyman said, was meant to renew an old Southwest Conference rivalry, dormant since 1991 when Arkansas left for the SEC, as an annual nonconference game.\nIt was before the new Kyle Field became close to being a reality, and when A&M-Arkansas wasn't among a slew of college games at AT&T Stadium, Hyman said.\nA&M's circumstances have \"changed dramatically,\" Hyman said. \"Paramount for me is doing what's right for our supporters.\"\nA&M and Arkansas played the nonconference game from 2009-2011 in Arlington, returned to the campuses in 2012 and 2013 to aid A&M's transition to the SEC, then returned to AT&T Stadium last season for the first in a scheduled 11-year run. A&M won 35-28 in overtime in front of a crowd of 68,113.\nHyman said that he and Long have discussed the price point for the game in Arlington as it is a \"sensitive\" topic for A&M fans. Both schools have to agree on changes to ticket prices, as the profits are split.\nA&M takes home $3.2 million-$3.5 million each year from its part in ticket, parking and merchandise sales. As the visiting team this year, A&M will make that amount on top of its seven home games at the 102,733-seat Kyle Field. When the game returns to a home-and-home, the visiting team will not make any money off the game.\nThe alternating home team plays $100 in rent each year to the Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones, a proud Arkansas alum. The Jones family celebrated the opening of the Jerry and Gene Jones Family Student-Athlete-Success Center on the Arkansas campus last weekend. The Jones family made a gift of $10.65 million.\n\"We are thrilled to have these teams playing at AT&T Stadium,\" said Rich Dalrymple, Cowboys senior vice president: public relations/communications, in a statement. \"We know that both schools have great followings in the area.\"\nThe Cowboys declined comment on Hyman's comment on \"constantly re-evaluating.\"\nThe contract doesn't specify an out-clause, but notes that the SEC commissioner can mediate a dispute between the participating schools.\nA&M playing the now-conference game away from home has continued to be a hot-button topic for A&M fans. Petrino, the former Arkansas coach, said in 2011 that A&M didn't want to continue to play the series in Arlington.\nWhen A&M signed the addendum to the original deal after joining the SEC, it may have helped with negotiations to replace Arkansas as LSU's final opponent of the regular season.\nOn Tuesday, Long said that Arkansas has made decisions and long-term plans on the series being in the Dallas-area, from recruiting to fund-raising -- because \"A&M has made the commitment twice.\"\nWhile both schools can benefit from playing a game in a recruiting hotbed, A&M coach Kevin Sumlin said the ideal would be to play the series at home.\n\"If you're going to leave, you're playing in arguably the best venue in the country, as far as professional stadiums,\" Sumlin said. \"Would we love to play at home in our new stadium? I don't think there's anyone who wouldn't. ... But that was decided before I got here.\"\nFollow Kate Hairopoulos on Twitter at @khairopoulos .\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/khairopoulos", "https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-23T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:54:14.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
