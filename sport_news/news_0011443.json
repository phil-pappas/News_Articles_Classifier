Dickey in Game 4 of the AL Championship Series, with Jays down 2-1 in games and needing a win on Tuesday.\nBut, truth be told, the anti-Dickey vitriol is not directed at the man himself, but more at the funky pitch he throws, the dancing knuckleball that he describes as capricious and fickle.\nOh, plus the Royals are very good.\nThe knuckler was at its most tantalizing and its most frustrating Tuesday as Dickey lasted just five outs in a 14-2 loss, yanked by manager John Gibbons to end his shortest start with Toronto in three years.\nIt didn’t take long. The Royals talented leadoff man, shortstop Alcides Escobar, dropped a bunt single down the third-base line, and Ben Zobrist followed with a home run into the right-field stands.\nAfter Lorenzo Cain walked and stole second, Eric Hosmer singled. A Russell Martin passed ball scored Cain and a Mike Moustakas sacrifice fly gave the Royals a four-run lead. In the second, Alex Rios homered to centre and, after two more runners reached, Dickey was gone.\n“He had to pull the trigger,” Dickey said, philosophically, of his manager’s decision. “We want to win that game. We’ve got a good offence. In our park (the Jays’ hitters) can come back. I knew once I walked Cain . . . once I got to 2-2, I was going to throw him two of my best knuckleballs and hope he either hit it in the ground or swung over it. If I didn’t get him, I knew I had Liam (Hendriks) coming behind me.\n“If you’re at this stage of the game, you know that it’s going to be a short leash.”\nIt didn’t feel that way when he warmed up.\n“I felt great, I had a great knuckleball,” Dickey said. “Russell was having trouble handling it, it was so good in the bullpen. Then when I got out there, I threw some great knuckleballs. Hosmer hit a line drive up the middle that was great. A leadoff bunt kind of took us by surprise . . . and then the two home runs.\n“But it’s just at this stage of the game it can happen very quickly with a team like that that is really good at hitting a ball in play and spoiling pitcher counts, which is what they do well. They foul off really good ones and you make a mistake, they get a hit. That’s why they have the best record in the American League. It’s not a fluke.”\nFor all the Dickey naysayers in Blue Jays Nation, it’s an easy argument. Just point at the box score: five runs in 1 2/3 innings. But beyond the box score are positive statistics, numbers that make observers feel the final club option year on his contract, $12 million for 2016, is still a bargain.\nHere are some arguments for keeping Dickey around for another season. Over the past four years, from 2012 through 2015, the 40-year old has thrown the most innings of any pitcher in the major leagues. Shocking. His 888 1/3 innings stand 2 2/3 innings ahead of James Shields. Third is Felix Hernandez.\nEven within Dickey’s 2015 season, one that is ending in disappointing fashion, his second-half numbers merited a spot in the Jays’ playoff rotation. Dickey was 8-1, with a 2.80 ERA and a 1.003 WHIP in 15 second-half starts. He had been 3-10 in the first half, but he always kept the faith that the numbers would find their proper level.\nAnd, as a knuckleballer who doesn’t have to worry about an ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, he is what he is for at least another year.\nThe more obvious problem for Dickey and the Jays is that Gibbons seemed to lose faith in his former ace more and more often as the season went on, even as his numbers improved. Consider that in Dickey’s first 23 starts, he was allowed to throw more than 100 pitches 21 times. But in his final 12 starts, including Tuesday, he reached 100 pitches just twice. A perfect example of Gibbons’ nervous approach with his knuckleballer came in the AL division series in Texas when the Jays led 7-1 and the manager pulled Dickey from the game with two outs in the fifth, when he was one out shy of qualifying for the win.\nThe decision of what to do with Dickey in 2016 must wait. At the moment, the Jays are still barely alive in the ALCS and the veteran Dickey feels he knows what has to be done.\n“We’re going to stay positive,” he said. “Thirty years ago the roles were reversed. Kansas City was down 3-1 to the Blue Jays. We’ve been here before where we’ve had to win three games in a row.\n“Hopefully Marco (Estrada) can keep us in and we can win one and then win another one. We’ll see where we stand, but this team has had its back to the wall before this year. This is nothing new. This is not uncharted territory for us.\n“We believe in one another and it’s going to be all right.”\nMore on thestar.com\nA Ruthian moment, but a Royal day: DiManno\nRoyals a better team than Blue Jays in every way in ALCS so far: Arthur", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:30:12.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
