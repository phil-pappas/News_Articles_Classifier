In the case of Tuesday afternoon’s match in Taft it was the Bakersfield Christian Eagles that provided the scare after they rolled past the Taft freshmen volleyball team 25-8, 25-12. “They played very timid today,” said Taft coach Jordyn Grissom. The tempo was set early in the first set when Bakersfield Christian reeled off four straight points. Taft followed by cutting the lead in half but the Lady Eagles countered with five unanswered points to up the advantage to 9-2. Taft briefly regained some momentum following a time out with a pair of points highlighted by Madison Jordan’s ace. That is when the Lady Eagles took off with a 6-1 run including the final four points of the run. Taft finally ended the run with a point but Bakersfield Christian answered with a pair of points. After the Lady Wildcats got another point, Bakersfield Christian went on an 8-1 run to close out the first set. The start of the second set turned into a back and forth battle before the Lady Eagles went on a 3-0 run to lead 5-2. Taft bounced back with five unanswered points highlighted by Jordan’s ace to take their first lead of the game at 7-5. Bakersfield Christian bounced back to tie the score before Taft regained the lead on Cherise Strong’s tip. The Lady Eagles took off from there by outscoring Taft 11-2 capped by seven straight points to end the run. Taft finally broke the run to trail 19-10 but Taft went on a 6-2 run to close out the set and match. “After the first loss, they were pumped up and wanted to get back into the game,” said Grissom. Jordan had 3 aces and a kill while Strong had a block and 7 kills. Taft returned to action Thursday when they traveled to Arvin.
