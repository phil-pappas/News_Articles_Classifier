Definitely not easy shots by JD. Gave us the lead we needed and took care of the rest going into the second half.\" JD Haaf (Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com ) \nThe second goal came with 21 seconds left in the half and was an impressive individual effort by Haaf, who made a move past a defender, dribbled down the sideline and found the back of the net to give the Tigers all the momentum going into intermission. \n\"I got the ball out wide. There was one person in front of me and I started to take him on, beat him and put it in the back of the net,\" Haaf said. \nIt was another highlight for Haaf, who has had plenty this season. \n\"He's had an awesome year,\" Hunsicker said. \"All-state quality year. He's definitely been carrying us offensively. He's just a great player, a strong player, physical player, quick speed. Definitely the best striker in the Colonial League, if not the area.\" \nThe Tigers play Moravian Academy on Thursday night with Colonial League gold on the line. Haaf hopes it's a repeat from two years ago when Northwestern won the league championship. \n\"It was a great feeling. That was my sophomore year,\" Haaf said. \"So we're looking for that again and hopefully we can do it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:02:41.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
