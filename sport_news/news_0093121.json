It was important for us to score the first goal. Then when you get the second goal before half time — I wouldn't say it's settled — but it looks good,\" Robben said. \nBayern, which experienced its first defeat of the season at Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday, moved provisionally 10 points clear of Borussia Dortmund after extending its league record start to 10 wins from 10 games. \n\"Nobody can imagine how hard a success it is to be mentally strong every weekend and to win every game,\" Bayern coach Pep Guardiola said. \nAlso Saturday, Admir Mehmedi scored in the 89th minute for Bayer Leverkusen to overturn a two-goal deficit and beat Stuttgart 4-3, Wolfsburg defeated Darmstadt 1-0, Eintracht Frankfurt came from behind to win 2-1 at Hannover and Werder Bremen won 3-1 at Mainz. \nMitchell Weiser's 10th-minute deflected strike was enough for Hertha Berlin to win the late game 1-0 at promoted Ingolstadt. The home side had 16 shots at goal compared to the visitors' five but couldn't make the breakthrough. \nEarlier, Stuttgart went 2-0 up with goals from Martin Harnik in the 51st and Daniel Didavi three minutes later. Karim Bellarabi pulled one back — shortly after coming on as a substitute — only for Lukas Rupp to restore the visitors' two-goal advantage when he was set up by Timo Werner. \n\"I believed the whole time that we could come back,\" said Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt, whose last game was a wild 4-4 draw with Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday. \nSchmidt's side pulled level with two goals in two minutes from Sebastian Boenisch and then Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez in the 71st, before Mehmedi sealed all the points on a counterattack. \n\"Whether it's an issue of tactics or quality, I don't know,\" said Didavi after Stuttgart's seventh defeat in 10 games. \nDaniel Caligiuri's 78th-minute strike was enough for Wolfsburg to beat Darmstadt and consolidate fourth place. \nFrankfurt had 19-year-old Marc Stendera to thank for ending its five-game run without a win. \nA brilliant run from Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake set up Felix Klaus to put Hannover ahead in the 51st, only for Stendera to equalize six minutes later and claim the winner in the 65th. \nThree goals in eight minutes gave Bremen a 3-0 half-time lead at Mainz and ended the side's run of five defeats. \nAnthony Ujah scored twice, first with his head in the 39th and then with his left boot in the 44th, before Fin Bartels scored in first-half injury time. \nJapanese forward Yoshinori Muto claimed Mainz' last-minute consolation.
