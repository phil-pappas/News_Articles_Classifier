The Utes’ all-conference big back is averaging 130.5 yards per game while also leading the team in receiving. Cravens is the Trojans’ most dependable defensive player, although somewhat inconsistent. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nUtah: LB Gionni Paul. The Miami transfer is quietly compiling an outstanding season and contributing to every aspect of the Utes’ defense, including 11 tackles last week against Arizona State. \nUSC: WR Adoree Jackson. With at least three key pass-catchers sidelined or slowed by injuries, the Trojans’ blazing two-way threat is likely to play extensively at offense this week. Utah’s defensive backs had better bring their running shoes. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nUSC racked up 590 yards in its 41-31 loss at Notre Dame last week in Helton’s first game in charge this season. … Utah has its highest regular-season ranking ever and its highest since hitting No. 2 after the 2008 season. … Utes QB Travis Wilson is from San Clemente, California, south of Los Angeles. His TD pass to Kaelin Clay with 8 seconds left beat USC 24-21 in Salt Lake City last season. … USC has lost three of its last four games, including two straight. The Trojans haven’t lost three straight games since the end of the 2012 season, and they haven’t lost three straight regular-season games since early in the 2001 season, coach Pete Carroll’s first year at the school. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:21:38.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
