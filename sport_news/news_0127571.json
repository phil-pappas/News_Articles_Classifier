The Lakers had no immediate update on his condition, but it didn't appear to be serious. \nKINGS: Rajon Rondo had 11 points and six assists. \nLAKERS: Lou Williams scored 16 points off the bench. \nRESTING UP: DeMarcus Cousins sat out in part because Sacramento coach George Karl wanted to remind his players not to rely too much on the All-Star center. \nUP NEXT: Sacramento faces New Orleans at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky - Cousins' college town - on Saturday. The Lakers face the Warriors in San Diego on Saturday. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
