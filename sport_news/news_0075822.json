(It's) such a balanced league that you can win every week or you can get your butt embarrassed every week.\" \nWofford has embarrassed the WCU defense plenty over the years with its funky triple option run offense, averaging 413 yards per game rushing over the past nine meetings to key an 8-1 record versus the Cats. \nVeteran coach Mike Ayers has his ground game in normal attack mode this season, averaging 261 yards per game rushing. \nWCU ranks next to last in the SoCon in rushing defense, allowing 203 ypg. \nNevertheless, Ayers said he is impressed with the Cats' defensive play. \n\"They've got as physical a defense as there is in the league,\" said Ayers, whose team winning percentage (85-55, .609) is the best in the SoCon. \n\"Our matchups are going to be tough, but at the same time, you like the challenge. Thanks goodness we're playing here at home.\" \nPlaying at home has been very good to the Terriers, who are 77-28 (.728) over the past 18 seasons at Gibbs Stadium. \n\"Wofford always plays exceptionally well at home — it's a tough place to play,\" Speir said. \n\"Wofford does what they do. They've done it for years and have been successful at it for years.\" \nWCU quarterback Troy Mitchell (10) is expected to start Saturday vs. Wofford after suffering a shoulder injury last week.
