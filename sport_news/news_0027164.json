Teams can be very successful with average goaltending, and they can work around suboptimal depth on defense (the Blackhawks basically played four for a month in the 2015 playoffs), but being weak at center is not an option.\nIt’s not just on the first line, either. Make a list of the best teams in the NHL and then make a list of the teams with the best center depth, and those two lists are going to look awfully similar.\nGreat players, future Hall of Fame members, did not make this list. Young, potential all-stars did not make this list.\nQuick note about the stats: CF% = Corsi for percentage at even strength.

Johansen took a little longer, but he’s tracking quite well en route to being part of the next wave of dominant centers. Given his size and skill set, he could end having a Ryan Getzlaf-type career, especially now that the Blue Jackets have found him a burgeoning world-class wing to wreak havoc on the league with in Brandon Saad.\nFantasy spin: Johansen is going to be a great all-around player, but he’s even better in fantasy hockey at this point. He should be one of the first 10 centers selected, and could finish the season in the top five.Johansen is going to be a great all-around player, but he’s even better in fantasy hockey at this point. He should be one of the first 10 centers selected, and could finish the season in the top five.\nNathan MacKinnon, Avalanche\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 2 seasons: 146 GP, 38 goals, 101 points, 47.7 CF%\nThis is an aggressive ranking for MacKinnon, who had a rough sophomore season. It’s not even certain that he will play center, but the Avalanche would be crazy not to play him there (and it wouldn’t be the first time the current regime has done something that was puzzling). He’s got an extra gear that few others have, and becoming pals with his childhood idol, Sidney Crosby, is going to help his development. He’s ready for a Steven Stamkos-like breakout season.\nFantasy spin: Buy with confidence, especially in a league that counts shots on goal. Even if he plays on the wing, he’s going to rack them (and likely, goals) up.\nPavel Datsyuk, Red Wings\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 155 GP, 58 goals, 151 points, 57.84 CF%\nThis is probably too low for Datsyuk. He’s almost always underrated, even by people who think he’s a unique, transcendent talent in the history of the sport. Injuries have robbed him of some production, but when he plays, he’s still a dominant, two-way force. He’s probably hasn’t even been near 100 percent the past couple years and he’s still great. All of that said, age and injury concerns (he’s going to miss the start of the season) are a problem.\nFantasy spin: Datsyuk is going to miss time, will remain injury-prone and doesn’t shoot a lot or hit or take penalties. Eventually, he could be a nice value as someone to plug in when he’s healthy but selecting him early in a draft is a mistake.\nConnor McDavid, Oilers\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 166 GP, 97 goals, 285 points (in the OHL)\nAnyone who predicts what McDavid will do with any sort of conviction is probably just guessing. Crosby had more than 100 points as a rookie, and McDavid is the best prospect to come along since then. He’s also joining a very different NHL. There is plenty of talent around McDavid in Edmonton, and he can have a better rookie season than anyone since Sid. He’s going to skate like MacKinnon, with an extra pinch of the “only a few guys have ever been able to do that at that speed” skills that makes Crosby special.\nFantasy spin: A top-15 finish in points is not out of the question. Someone might try to be bold and grab McDavid in the second round, but don’t be that person. Somewhere in the 30s is when he starts to be a good idea, though.\nClaude Giroux, Flyers\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 211 GP, 66 goals, 207 points, 52.42 CF%\nThis is where the list really starts to get tough. Giroux could win the scoring title in 2015-16. He’s absolutely a franchise player, but he also needs more help. He and Jakob Voracek form one of the top 1-2 offensive duos in the league. He’s only missed six games in the past six seasons, despite missing time during training camp twice because of injuries.\nFantasy spin: Giroux could be a top-5 or top-7 center, and maybe a little better in leagues that count hits. Given his durability, he’s a safe late first/early second-round pick.\nNicklas Backstrom, Capitals\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 212 GP, 44 goals, 205 points, 51.58 CF%\nBackstrom is fourth among centers in points in the past three seasons. He’s one of the best passers in the sport, fantastic defensively and often doesn’t get the credit he deserves because he’s considered the sidekick to the greatest goal scorer of this century. Coaches always talk up their players, but Barry Trotz went out of his way to stump for Backstrom as one of the best centers in the sport in his first year in Washington.\nFantasy spin: He doesn’t score a lot of goals or take a lot of shots, but he’s fantastic in assists and especially power-play points. He’s currently outside the top 20 among centers in Yahoo’s average draft position, possibly in part because of a lingering injury. He may only miss four games, though. Be sure to add an extra sniper at some point, but don’t wait for 20 other centers to be off the board before taking Backstrom.\nTyler Seguin, Stars\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 199 GP, 90 goals, 193 points, 54.74 CF%\nA young player who had some maturity issues in Boston, but worked through them thanks to the great veterans in the Bruins dressing room that everyone in New England always writes … oh wait. Seguin still has more maturing to do, but he’s also a ridiculously talented player and an incredible value for the Stars on his current contract. He and Jamie Benn are lethal together, and now they have another new friend to help them score goals like crazy with Patrick Sharp on the roster.\nFantasy spin: He’s a mid first-round pick, and he’s worth it. Benn won the Art Ross Trophy this past season, and both he and Seguin are contenders to do so in 2015-16.\nPatrice Bergeron, Bruins\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 203 GP, 63 goals, 149 points, 59.84 CF%\nBergeron is probably the best defensive forward of his generation (though a younger Pavel Datsyuk might like to have a word about that). He is a prototype for the modern shutdown center who also can produce offensively, in part because he is such a dominant puck possession player. It’s hard to knock him for producing less than the group ahead of him, because some of that is the team he plays for and his coach not playing him enough at times.\nFantasy spin: The Bruins’ decline from a dominant even-strength team sapped some of Bergeron’s value, because he previously was among the league leaders in plus-minus. If you’re in a league that includes Corsi for percentage, congrats on being ahead of the times, but otherwise Bergeron is likely to last until the seventh or eighth round.\nJohn Tavares, Islanders\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 189 GP, 90 goals, 199 points, 52.81 CF%\nTavares is a wonderful player, but there is a twinge of disappointment about what he’s been able to accomplish to this point in his career. Sure, the Islanders have been a mess for years, and that is a valid excuse … to a point. He was the first “best prospect since Crosby” (before McDavid), and in six years he hasn’t won a major award or a playoff series. He’s great, but he also hasn’t faced nearly the scrutiny that Crosby and Alex Ovechkin have. And neither of those franchises were exactly in a great place when they arrived, either.\nFantasy spin: He’s been the fourth player taken, and the third center, in Yahoo drafts. Choosing between him and the two Starsjohn (Seguin and Benn) is splitting hairs. Anywhere sixth or below makes him a potential steal.\nRyan Getzlaf, Ducks\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 198 GP, 71 goals, 206 points, 51.18 CF%\nGetzlaf’s only flaw is he doesn’t shoot enough. His coaches and teammates have prodded him to do it more, and he’s acknowledged that he should. He’s a world-class passer, and so great at all of the other aspects, tangible or otherwise, it is hard to hold that against him. He has a chance to finish his career as the best player in the best draft class in NHL history.\nFantasy spin: He’s just outside the top-10 centers in Yahoo’s average draft position, in part because of the low shot totals but also because the Ducks' power play struggled last season. If they get the PP rolling, Getzlaf would be a great value in the third round.\nEvgeni Malkin, Penguins\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 160 GP, 60 goals, 175 points, 54.55 CF%\nThere was a time when the only player in the world who might have been better than Malkin was the other superstar center in a Penguins uniform. And there are still stretches within a season when that is the case. Malkin is still second in points per game in the past three seasons, but he’s missed at least 15 percent of the games in five of the past six campaigns including each of the past three.\nFantasy spin: Malkin has underperformed compared to preseason expectations each of the past two seasons, but not as much as the general narrative has suggested. He also still might have a dominant season in him, especially if the Penguins’ power play is as good as it looks on paper.\nSteven Stamkos, Lightning\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 167 GP, 97 goals, 169 points, 51.99 CF%\nStamkos doesn’t fit the traditional mold (he’s more Ovechkin than Crosby), but he has been determined to improve the other areas of his game beyond his incredible shot. He’s certainly the best goal-scorer at the position. The Lightning are well positioned to contend for several seasons, so Stamkos going to have more chances to add to his postseason resume, assuming he signs a long-term extension.\nFantasy spin: He’s going to be selected in the first three picks. If you have one of them, enjoy the goals, shots and power-play points. Also, target a pass-first center or wing later on to complement him.\nAnze Kopitar, Kings\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 208 GP, 55 goals, 176 points, 60.4 CF%\nHe has Malkin’s size and silky smooth moves, but also the two-way awareness that separates him, Bergeron, Datsyuk and the next guy on this list in the Selke Trophy race every season. The Kings struggle to score at times, but Kopitar is a possession wizard and the perfect player for Darryl Sutter’s system without the puck, which requires extra effort and extra smarts.\nFantasy spin: Kopitar’s numbers could be boosted by some better luck for the Kings in general, but his shot total was way down last year. The next three centers in Yahoo’s average draft rank are Johansen, McDavid and MacKinnon, younger players with more upside. If Kopitar slips into the late 30s or early 40s, then is the time to pounce.\nJonathan Toews, Blackhawks\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 204 GP, 90 goals, 199 points, 57.47 CF%\nIs Toews a good leader? Has anyone written anything in an attempt to determine this? Kidding aside, it does seem like Toews’ incredible skills get overlooked at times. He’s great at winning puck battles and finding loose pucks, and there is more to that than just sheer will.\nFantasy spin: Toews’ average draft position is just inside the top 20. Don’t be surprised if someone drafts him too early. Patrick Sharp and Brandon Saad are gone, but there are plenty of talented players still around to support Captain Serious.\nSidney Crosby, Penguins\n© Provided by Sporting News Past 3 seasons: 193 GP, 79 goals, 244 points, 55.07 CF%\nCrosby has won the Hart Trophy twice and was the runaway favorite in two other seasons before season-ending injuries. The debate about whether or not he’s the best player in the world is largely silly. The Penguins have been doomed by depth or goaltending issues in recent seasons. Marc-Andre Fleury had a very nice season in 2014-15 and there is hope that the overall roster is deeper. He’s still the best player. Let’s stop overthinking this.\nFantasy spin: There is a worthy argument that goals are the greatest commodity in fantasy hockey, so Ovechkin and Stamkos should be the first two picks. Crosby also has missed games more regularly than other top stars. That said, Phil Kessel is the sniper the Penguins have yearned for and Crosby could rack up 40 power-play points while running away with a third scoring title.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/story/2015-10-02/top-nhl-goaltenders-contract-cap-hit-jonathan-quick-corey-crawford-ben-bishop", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/story/2015-10-05/what-is-a-corsi-number-explained-stats-nhl-hockey-advanced-statistics", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656957-nhl-goaltender-rankings-fantasy-2015-16-henrik-lundqvist-carey-price-rinne-rask"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T21:25:00.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
