Punjab page: Eminent Punjabi writers return awards Akademi president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari while reacting to Sahgal's tough stance had told a newspaper: \"She earned all the profits. She can now return all the Award money, but what of the credibility and goodwill she earned through the Award?\" In a letter to Tiwari, Sahgal said: \"I have considered the award a high honour, but my \"credibility\" had been established decades before 1986... You have mentioned 'profits.' The award in 1986 would perhaps have been Rs. 25,000, but not more than Rs. 50,000. In consultation with Ashok Vajpeyi (eminent Hindi writer), who has also returned his award, I am enclosing a cheque for one lakh rupees.\" Sahgal's sharp reaction came on a day when three eminent writers from Punjab said they were returning their Akademi awards, and Kannada writer Aravind Malagatti resigned from the body's general council. The writers joined the growing protest by litterateurs over \"rising intolerance\" and \"communal\" atmosphere. \"The fact that so many writers are returning their awards or resigning from Akademi posts makes it clear how anguished we are that you have remained silent over the murder and intimidation of writers. Has the Sahitya Akademi washed its hands of its responsibility to safeguard our Constitutional right to freedom of speech?\" Shagal asked Tiwari. In Mumbai, poet and critic Adil Jussawalla, who received the Sahitya Akademi honour for his work in 2014, today urged the literary body to condemn the \"unacceptable censoring\" of writers by \"violently intolerant groups.\" In a letter to the Sahitya Akademi president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari, Jussawalla, while referring to the murder of Kannada writer M M Kalburgi and the killings of rationalists Narendra Dhabolkar and Govind Pansare, urged the body to speak up and issue a statement condemning the state of affairs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:19:52.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
