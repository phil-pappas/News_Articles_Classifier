Chicago Cubs will play the Cardinals in their season opener for the first time since 1991. \nThe 2015 schedule features eight interleague series against the American League Central, including the annual home-and-home sets against the Chicago White Sox. The Cubs and White Sox in 2015 will play a total of six games, with the first three games taking place at Wrigley Field leading up to the All Star Break from July 10-12 followed by three games at U.S. Cellular Field on August 14-16. \nIn addition to the White Sox series, the Cubs welcome three additional A.L. Central opponents: the Kansas City Royals (three games, May 29-31), the Cleveland Indians (two games, June 15-16) and the Detroit Tigers (two games, August 18-19). The Cubs travel to play at Detroit (two games, June 9-10), Cleveland (two games, June 17-18) and Minnesota (three games, June 19-21). The Cubs visit Cleveland for the first time since 2006. \nThe Chicago Cubs 2015 tentative schedule features only two three-series homestands and two three-city road trips (after four three-city road trips in 2014 and five three-city road trips in 2013). \nPaul M.
