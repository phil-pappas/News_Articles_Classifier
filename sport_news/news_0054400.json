Chris Morzenti of Mount Shasta came in 1st, while Michael Martin of Etna was 7th Below is a recap of the invitational by Yreka head cross country coach Pam Borg. “The Chico Invite presented a new running and scoring format for the varsity divisions. The varsity races were contested separately with the top three runners in one race and runners 4-7 in another race. The top 5 times were then added up to mark the final team standings. It was great because the mid of the pack runners (4-7) got a chance to be leaders in their race. It was rally cool to watch. The varsity girls won their seventh team title out of nine of the season. In the 4-7 runner race, Lena Fogle and Arianna Brooks went 1-2. Lena took the lead at the mile mark and control the rest of the course. Arianna fought hard down the finish straight to keep her fast closing Chico opponent at bay. Lilli ran a strong second half, along with first time varsity runner and teammate, McKenzie Morey-Adams, to secure a top 15 finish, 13th and 14th respectively. In the 1-3 runner race, cool headed Carly Gutermuth of Trinity, paced her way to a win in a fine time of 19:17. Mallory Ward and Central Valley's, Anna Lewis, battled back and forth with Mallory leading most of the 5K course. Anna put on her kick and finished ahead of Mallory, both running strong times of 20:25 and 20:30 and placing 4th and 5th. Meri Krier, placed 6th, and Lacey Jackson raced to a season best of 21:33, good enough for 12th place. The varsity boys placed third overall. The main attraction was the battle between Mount Shasta's Chris Morzenti, Trinity's Ben Harper, and Chico's Jack Emanuel. All three set a very fast pace through the first mile ( sub 5 minutes) and they never let up as all three were still together at the 21/2 mile mark. Chris Morzenti shifted gears over the last 200 to take the win. Isaac Fernandez was our top Miners, finishing in 6th in a season best of 17:19. Blake Chitwood kicked it in and crossed the line in 17th, Nico Lupacchino was 22nd. Hunter Scott pr'd in the 4-7 runner race, with a 18:52 and 11th place finish. James Elliott also ran a season best of 19:42. Miles Charter was the freeshman boys top finisher in 13:47. And, Angelic Avery was our top JV girl.”   Writer Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 11:27 AM Updated at 5:09 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:18:47.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
