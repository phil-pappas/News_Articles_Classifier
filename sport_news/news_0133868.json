This is not the Tour de France. This is U.S. District Court. There are rules.\nA federal judge scolded Lance Armstrong's legal team on Tuesday for an improper citation in a court filing related to the government's False Claims Act lawsuit against Armstrong, in which the Justice Department seeks up to $100 million.\n\"While the Court will grant the motion, counsel for Armstrong, and for all the parties, are reminded of their duty of candor to the Court in citing authority,\" wrote U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Cooper, who oversees the case in Washington D.C.\nCooper noted that an Oct. 7 motion filed by Armstrong's attorneys incorrectly cited the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, claiming government lawyers were \"required\" to produce certain information to Armstrong when in fact the rule says they \"may\" do so.\nThe underlying issue is an upcoming deposition in which a representative of the U.S. Postal Service is scheduled to give testimony about the USPS sponsorship of Armstrong's now-discredited Tour de France cycling teams. The government seeks the return of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars it says were taken under false pretenses (Armstrong denied his doping until 2013.)\nArmstrong's lawyers have argued that the USPS enjoyed promotional benefits from the association, which ended in 2004, years before revelations about the team's institutionalized doping program led to the invalidation of Armstrong's seven Tour de France wins and his banishment from sports.\nThe USPS deposition is Oct. 20, and Cooper granted Armstrong's wish, ordering the Justice Department to identify who will testify on behalf of the USPS that day and what subjects they'll be prepared to testify about. Cooper said the government should give Armstrong six days' notice on those matters, but noted the rules do not require such notice, as Armstrong's brief had claimed.\nNo trial date is set in the long-running case, though sworn depositions are scheduled to be completed by February. One hangup has been Nike, another sponsor of Armstrong's teams. The shoe and apparel giant has gone to federal court in Oregon to fight a subpoena from the Justice Department seeking documents about Nike's relationship with Armstrong.\nArmstrong has already been deposed in the case, as has Floyd Landis, his former teammate, who blew the whistle on the team's doping in 2010. Because Landis originally filed the suit under the False Claims Act (the government joined as a plaintiff in 2013), he stands to gain up to one-third of any damages that Armstrong or others may be forced to pay at the conclusion of the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:48:07.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
