They will be excited to start a fresh season at 0-0 going into districts so I am sure we will get their best effort.” District wins are important. Teams that win or have the best records over the next four games will advance into the playoffs that start Nov. 3 with bi-district.MHS didn’t move the ball easily against Chapman, but the Dogs showed some consistency. Typically MHS can play well for a series or 10-12 plays before things start to go wrong, Heuer said.Errors also hurt as do injuries, which the Bulldogs have battled this season. Combine it with a lack of numbers or little depth and it puts a strain on players MHS does have, Heuer said.Against Chapman, Marysville fought from behind to gain a 9-7 lead from senior Chris Deters’ safety and junior Jayton Haggard’s 31-yard pass from senior Tommy Brinegar all in the third quarter. Senior Andres Patino kicked the extra point.Chapman’s Chandler Sweet hit Brandon Colston on a 35-yard pass for the winning score late in the fourth.MHS 0 0 9 0 — 9 CHS 7 0 0 7 — 14 Rushing: (M) Blumer 1-10, Warnick 16-30, Brinegar 16-58.
