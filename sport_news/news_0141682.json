Hewlett’s 2-point pass gave the Hornets an 8-7 lead with 5:55 left in the first half. \nBut the Tigers stole the momentum as Ryan Cywinski barreled through tacklers and returned the ensuing kickoff 82 yards for a touchdown and a 14-8 lead. \nHe would find the end zone again on Tunkhannock’s next drive on a 9-yard run to extend the lead to 21-8 with 2:05 left before halftime. \n“I’ve never had this feeling before,” Ryan said. “Senior year and a 21-game losing streak — to finally break that is an amazing feeling, especially with my brother. I couldn’t have done it without him, or without my linemen. It’s not me just making the plays, it’s the whole team.” \nAfter Ryan Cywinski ended an 11-play drive to start the third quarter with a 3-yard touchdown run, his brother found the endzone with a 6-yard run of his own to extend Tunkhannock’s lead to 33-8 with 10:40 left in the game. \nThe Tigers then caused a fumble on the ensuing kickoff and quickly capitalized when Logan scored his third touchdown of the night, this time from 6-yards out, to put the game away. \nLogan finished the game with 143 yards on the ground and added 115 through the air, while Ryan rushed for 95 yards and caught two passes for 39 more. \n“We thought our kids would have a little bit of confidence and desire coming in, but I think we came in a little overconfident,” Honesdale head coach Mike Jurkowski said. “We as coaches took Tunkhannock a little bit for granted and they played really hard and took it to us. They were just a better football team tonight.” We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.
