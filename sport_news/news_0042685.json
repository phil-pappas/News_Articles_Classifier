That's a big improvement for me. \n\"In terms of confidence, in terms of level of tennis, I am playing better. I'm very happy for that because I am working so hard.\" \nIn the last four Nadal will take on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who battled past in-form Kevin Anderson 7-6 (8/6) 5-7 6-4. \nNovak Djokovic was given his sternest test of the week by Bernard Tomic but still came through in straight sets, winning 7-6 (8/6) 6-1. \nThe world number one was immediately broken back after forging ahead in the opening set and Tomic saved two set points in the tie-break. \nBut Djokovic made no mistake on his third opportunity and raced through the second set. \nThird seed Andy Murray produced a devastating display to rout Tomas Berdych and set up a semi-final clash with Djokovic. \nBerdych had given Murray a lot of trouble in the past and had won six of their previous 12 meetings. \nBut the Czech was left bewildered by the brilliance of Murray as the world number two triumphed 6-1 6-3. \nMurray told Sky Sports 3: \"I felt like I dictated all match and, against someone who hits the ball as big as Tomas, that's not always easy to do. In the second set I felt could have won all of the games. \n\"I'm very happy with the performance and it's good to conserve some energy before tomorrow.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:08:58.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
