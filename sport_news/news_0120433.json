But I’m too nervous to buy a bank-owned property. What are the options for someone like me?\nA: You can get a good deal on a foreclosed property, but you can also get a good deal on a property under a short sale. A short sale happens when a homeowner owes more on a mortgage than the property is worth. It’s an agreement between the lender and the buyer to accept less than the total amount that’s due on a mortgage. This allows the homeowner to avoid foreclosure and subsequent bad credit and saves the lender the hassle of foreclosing on a buyer and acquiring the property. Many more homeowners are willing to short-sell their house long before the bank starts to worry. You’ll need to locate a broker who specializes in short sales, because they usually know who needs to sell fast and why. Call the manager of your local real estate office and ask them who the best agent is for the job.\nQ: About five years ago, I had to turn to the subprime market to get a mortgage. Since then I’ve made every mortgage payment on time and eliminated all of my credit card debt. Currently, I have a FICO score of about 805. My question to you is, with all the government money going into the American banks, where do you see mortgage rates bottoming out? When would be a good time to lock in a new 30-year fixed mortgage?\nA: There’s no better time to lock in your interest rate than right now, and, with your good score, you’ll have no problem getting the best rate out there. The fact is nobody knows when mortgage rates will bottom out and you’d be crazy to try to time it.\nLet me tell you what happened to me when I got a new mortgage on a property I bought three months ago. I asked the three smartest bankers I know for advice and they all advised me not to lock in the rate because rates would surely be going lower! I locked it in anyway because I wanted to sleep at night knowing my decision had already been made. As it turned out, all three bankers were dead wrong; the rates didn’t go lower, they went a full point higher! The lesson here is, there’s no science in guessing rates, and in my book, sleeping well at night is worth at least a half an interest point, maybe even more.\nQ: My wife, two daughters and I are living in Brooklyn, where I pay $1,000/month rent for a 2½-bedroom apartment. My wife and I are both in our mid-40s and are contemplating purchasing our first home. Given the current state of flux with the economy, as well as the fact that we’re purchasing our first home at this stage in our lives, would it be a wise move? My father insists that we should just stay where we are and invest as much money as we can toward our retirement.\nA: If you’ve saved enough money to put down on a new home, just go for it. There has never been a better time to buy a house than now, and this time may never come again. The question you and your wife should ask yourselves is how ill you feel five years from now when house prices are going through the roof and you’re watching all the action through the window of the same old 2½-bedroom apartment? I’ll guarantee your biggest regret will have been not moving sooner. I’m sure your father is well-intended suggesting you save for retirement. But remember that your father loves you and whenever you ask a loved one whether you should take a risk, they almost always tell you not to. So thank your father for his love and advice and do what’s best for your family.\nQ: My condo villa has been on the market and vacant in South Florida for nine months. It’s the second- lowest priced (just under $100,000) of the many that are for sale in this adult subdivision. Every month, it becomes more difficult to write the mortgage and maintenance checks, let alone pay the bills for utilities, insurance, etc. My ability to keep paying is almost completely gone. Help! What can I do?\nA: First, make your home the lowest priced house, not the second lowest, because there’s nothing to be gained by second best. You probably won’t have to drop it by much and your house will have a huge advantage over its competition. Next, you should renegotiate your loan with your lender to reduce your monthly payments. It will take some of the pressure off you month to month until you can find a buyer. If you happen to have a lot of equity in your house and you don’t need your cash out, you can advertise seller financing. A below-market rate mortgage financing offer will encourage many hesitant buyers to get off the fence and buy your house.\nQ: For two years, my wife and I have been trying to sell our house located in a 55+ development. Our Realtor puts our listing on Craigslist, but we’ve had no inquiries. Our home is only four years old, on a premium lot, with custom millwork and upgrades on all cabinets, appliances, flooring and fixtures. Besides lowering the price 20% below comparable homes, can you suggest any other tactics that will move this house?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:03:26.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
