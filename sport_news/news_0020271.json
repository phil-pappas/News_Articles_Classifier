Six times, they came up short, mainly because the Vikings had one of their best run-stuffing performances since coach Mike Zimmer took over 21 games ago.\n“We controlled the line of scrimmage,” Zimmer said after his team held the Chiefs to 57 yards on 18 carries (3.2) in Sunday’s 16-10 victory at TCF Bank Stadium. “That’s a big key.”\nThe highlight came shortly after momentum began to swing in Kansas City’s favor following a 39-yard completion to Jeremy Maclin midway through the third quarter. The Vikings led 13-0 when the Chiefs faced third-and-1 at the Vikings 7-yard line.\nThe Chiefs ran the ball. No gain.\nUndeterred, the Chiefs ran the ball again on fourth-and-1. Again, they were stopped for no gain.\n“Short-yardage situations are such big plays,” linebacker Anthony Barr said. “Anytime we can discourage the other team like that, it’s such a big momentum shift.”\nThe Chiefs converted only three of 12 third downs. On fourth down, they were 0-for-2. One of their eight penalties for 95 yards came when running back Charcandrick West was flagged 15 yards for a chop block on third-and-1 at the Vikings 14-yard line.\nThe Chiefs really tried to win with muscle on those two short-yardage plays at the Vikings 7-yard line. On third down, they brought in an extra tackle and handed off to 242-pound fullback Anthony Sherman.\n“Just being aggressive on that play,” said Barr, who made the initial stop and was helped by end Brian Robison. “They gave it to the fullback, which is kind of different for them. And he just ran right into me.”\nThe fourth-down play was Sharrif Floyd at his best when he’s healthy. Chiefs left tackle Donald Stephenson tried to block down on Floyd and seal him to the backside, but Floyd used his quickness to beat Stephenson to the gap, his speed to quickly track West and his power to immediately drop him.\n“I came scot-free and made the play,” Floyd said. “Can’t miss the layup.”\nYes, it helped that the Chiefs were without running back Jamaal Charles, their best offensive player. But a defense also deserves credit when it’s halftime and the other team’s offense has 51 total yards.\nIn three home games, the Vikings are 3-0 and have allowed only 185 yards rushing on 62 carries (2.98). In two road losses, they’ve allowed 374 yards rushing on 63 carries (5.9).\nSunday was a collective effort against the run. In his first game as a three-down middle linebacker, rookie Eric Kendricks had a game-high 10 tackles, including a solo stop of Davis for no gain on third-and-1.\nAnother rookie, Danielle Hunter, started at right end for Everson Griffen, who missed the game because of an illness. All Hunter did was share a sack with Floyd and force the fumble that Robison recovered to help seal the victory in the closing minutes.\nNose tackle Linval Joseph was a consistent headache for rookie center Mitch Morse. On Kansas City’s second possession, Joseph knocked Morse on his backside, forced Morse into a holding penalty that negated a 13-yard completion and had a tackle for loss on second-and-2.\n“What’s the goal every week?” Joseph asked. “Stop the run. Today, we met that goal.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:39:41.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
