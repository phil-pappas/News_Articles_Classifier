The only time she had beaten the Chinese was at the World Championships in 2013. \n\nSindhu produced a dominating game as she lead 4-2 early on and then kept extending the lead to eventually seal the opening game. \n\nIn the second game, Ying tried to put up a fight and opened up a slender 4-2 lead but the Indian clawed back in no time and broke off at 8-8 to move to 14-9 lead. Ying narrowed down the lead to 13-14 but she could never wrest control as Sindhu marched on to shut the door on her higher-ranked opponent. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:58:55.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
