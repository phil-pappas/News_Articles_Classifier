Fortunately for the Fair Grove Eagles, Hill Top Pizza and Grill has just that.“If you live in this area, you know about Hill Top Pizza,” said Fair Grove head coach Brad Voorhis. Along with pizza, Hill Top offers house-smoked brisket, pulled pork, and something called “loaded tots.” Fair Grove is using all of that, plus the support of an entire town, to move toward a program landmark.“Getting that sixth win, making these seniors, they’ve never been on a team that’s had a winning season at the end of the year,” Voorhis said. They’ll try to get that sixth win against Hollister on Friday.“I’ve played football here for four years, and a winning season, to me, would mean something big,” said senior right guard Nate Mallard. “That’s not been done in four years.” It’s actually been even longer than that.“It would mean a lot to me,” said senior wide reciver/free safety Travis Beach. “I know it would mean a lot to the rest of the seniors, guaranteeing that winning season. We’ve never done that, not even in middle school.” Customers who walk in to Hill Top are immediately greeted with a huge Fair Grove Eagles logo on the back wall. That’s symbolic of the support the restaurant and city provide to the team.“You walk in here, they know you’re a football player,” Mallard said. “They tell you good job Friday night, or good luck Friday night.”“We come in, we’re treated like family immediately,” Beach said. “They’re always saying hey and ask us how we’re doing, and how our grandparents and uncles and aunts are doing.” Now, that brisket. Hill Top cook Cody Crews takes it right off a smoker in the backyard. After the meat is injected with marinade and seasoned with a secret spice rub, it’s smoked overnight and left in the smoker until it is portioned out for service. The pizza is also homemade and full of secrets. Handmade dough is rolled and portioned, then covered in a house-secret sauce. The award-winning “all-meat” has pork sausage, Italian sausage, beef, ham, pepperoni, bacon and cheese. After 15 minutes in a 600 degree oven, it’s ready to go. The Eagles will have Hill Top and the town of Fair Grove behind them for our KSPR Game of the Week, when they host Hollister Friday night.
