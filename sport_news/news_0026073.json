He was addressing the Popular Lecture Progamme of Uttarakhand Council of Science and Technology (UCSOT), organised on the council’s campus on Saturday. Dr KS Valdiya said the 12 Jyotirlings, including Mallikarjun, Rameshwaram and Omkareshwar, originated because of a precedence of geological marvels such as land movements, existing faults, glacial faceted rocks or tectonically forced upheavals. By linking life sciences, anthropology and Indian mythology, Dr Valdiya gave an overview of how the geological activities encouraged the human kind to establish or develop their civilization. He also pointed out how human civilizations had evolved and adapted themselves in different geographical regions and how the different races migrated to India. Presiding over the session, Prof AN Purohit emphasised that scientific temperament should be inculcated among young students by organising science lectures in all districts of the state. Earlier, Director General, UCOST, Dr Rajendra Dobhal welcomed Dr Valdiya to UCOST office-Vgyan Dham. Nearly 250 partcipants, including scientists, students, faculty members and researchers from various scientific institutions attended the lecture. UCOST’s Dr D P Uniyal coordinated the programme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:06:53.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
