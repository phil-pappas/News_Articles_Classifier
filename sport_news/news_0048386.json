It has remained the same since then.\nAdChoices The 14-time NBA All-Star believes, however, that the former Bulls star is deserving of the honor.\n“I hate to say it’s not a Laker, but Michael Jordan,” West told HuffPost Live’s Jordan Schultz. “He’s been the greatest player I’ve ever seen. And I’m probably a harsh judge of talent in the sense that I admire players that are really good defensive players and really good offensive players. And I felt that at his time in the game, he was the best defensive player in the game, but more importantly he was the best offensive player. And he made his teams win.”\nJordan, a six-time NBA champion, was also elected to 14 NBA All-Star teams and is widely regarded as the best player in league history.\n“He would be a wonderful person to have there,” West said .\n- Kayla Lombardo\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerry-west-nba-logo-michael-jordan_5627e042e4b02f6a900f5297", "http://www.si.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:32:51.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
