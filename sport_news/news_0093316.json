Chiropractor Patrick Kerr, DC, created the collar and released the product on his website. \n\n2. Before the collar was released, researchers extensively tested the device at the Center for Injury and Biomechanics on the Virginia Tech campus, located in Blacksburg. \n\n3. Clemson (S.C.) University and The University of South Carolina, located in Columbia, adopted the device for their athletes. \n\n4. Resting in the shoulder pads, the device allows full range of motion. \n\n5.
