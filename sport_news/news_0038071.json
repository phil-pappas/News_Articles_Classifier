The report said Embiid refuses to eat healthful foods, opting for hot dogs, chicken fingers, and pitchers of Shirley Temple drinks instead of the fruit and vegetables placed in his hotel residence by a team employee. \n\"This story is old. It's been documented. The media did a hell of a job reporting accurately what has been going on,\" Brown said. \"To all of a sudden wake up and have these things be revisited, I think in some ways is unfortunate and sad.\" \nThe report said that owner Josh Harris instructed Brown and general manager Sam Hinkie to keep Embiid from attending the Las Vegas Summer League. Brown said that was not true. Embiid, the article said, was \"determined to go to Vegas to party.\" \nThe article said Embiid refused to wear the boot in Vegas and played basketball, even dunking. This, the article said, created a theory that Embiid reinjured the foot in Vegas. The team said that Embiid needed surgery in August because his initial injury did not heal properly. \n\"I'm proud of where Joel Embiid is at,\" Brown said. \"He's had a rough few years of not playing. He will get there. We're moving him forward. And more importantly, he's moving himself forward.\" \nEmbiid had his leopard-print cast removed on Monday and watched Friday's game from the bench. Pierre Jackson finished with two points in limited minutes as the guard played his first preseason game after being sidelined with a groin injury. Nerlens Noel and Jerami Grant also played limited minutes. Jahlil Okafor missed the game with right knee soreness. \nThe Sixers fell behind, 41-22, after the Wizards shot a blistering 84 percent from the field in the first quarter. They rallied to cut Washington's lead to five with 1 minute, 10 seconds left, but could not get any closer. \nPoint guard T.J. McConnell played well, scoring 10 points and handing out 10 assists as he works to carve a role on the team. He plays aggressive defense and brings up the ball with energy. He is also a crafty passer, dishing no-look passes in transition and swift one-handed bounce passes to the low post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:49:16.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
