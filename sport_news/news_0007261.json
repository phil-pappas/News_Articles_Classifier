The Wolverines dropped to 10-3-0 overall, while suffering their first loss in league play, falling to 3-1-0. \n\"We gave two goals away today on mistakes that can't happen at this level. That said, I was very encouraged by our ability to respond, and truthfully, we were unfortunate to not score on multiple opportunities,\" UVU head coach Greg Maas said. \"We are in a good position in the WAC, and I am confident we'll get back on track this Friday at Clyde Field vs. SJSU.\" \nAaron Meyer scored his fourth goal of the season to give UVU a 1-0 lead in the 37th minute, but that advantage was short-lived after Dominick Faletto got the equalizer just three minutes later. \nAfter going into the half tied at 1-1, Alex Baez scored what turned out to be the game-winner in the 52nd minute, rebounding a shot by Erick Aragon. \nHouston Baptist outshot Utah Valley, 14-11 and 8-3 on goal, with two shots on goal from the Huskies coming in the last 10 seconds. Derek Wilcox recorded six saves for the Wolverines. \nHBU goalkeeper Chance Pope recorded one save in goal with the other save coming as a team save when Aragon cleared a Skyler Milne header right at the goal line. \nThe Wolverines return home to host San Jos√© State on Friday as part of a doubleheader. UVU's women host Grand Canyon at 5 p.m., with the men's game slated to begin at 7:30 p.m. Utah Valley then travels to CSU Bakersfield for a Sunday contest at 1 p.m. PT.
