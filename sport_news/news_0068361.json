Use the guide below to brush up on a few of the ingredients or dishes you may not recognize:\nQueso panela : This semisoft cow's milk cheese is moist like fresh mozzarella and has a light, fresh, slightly salty flavor. At The Mexican, Torres griddles it inside enchiladas rojas with red-chili-stewed mushrooms and guajillo-ancho salsa.\nPiloncillo : Think brown sugar, but less processed. Juice straight from the sugar-cane plant is boiled down to a thick syrup and poured into cone-shaped molds to harden; when you buy a cone from a Mexican market, you can chop it with a knife or grate off what you need. The flavor is more caramel-y than American brown sugar, with some notes of rum. Try it in The Mexican's pineapple-serrano mezcalita (mezcal margarita) made with grilled pineapple, lime and piloncillo simple syrup.\nFideo seco : To make this Mexican pasta dish, chefs typically fry or toast noodles, soak them in a (sometimes spicy) tomato sauce and then bake them. Torres serves his fideo seco with a half-chicken and a helping of house-made corn tortillas.\nOpen for dinner daily; lunch and brunch coming soon. 1967 N.
