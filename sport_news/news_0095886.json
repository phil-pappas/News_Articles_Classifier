While Wenger hailed Bayern as one of the best teams in the world at his pre-match press conference, he also warned there are no sides without weakness. Exploiting any chink in the Germans' formidable armour is likely to rest on the creativity of Mesut Ozil, industry of Alexis Sanchez and the pace of Theo Walcott. \nBank on Cech \nWith David Ospina out with a shoulder injury, Wenger does not have to make another choice between the Colombian and veteran Petr Cech, who returned another impressive display with a clean sheet in the 3-0 Barclays Premier League win at Watford. The former Champions League winner has yet to feature in Europe for Arsenal since moving from Chelsea in the summer, and given the attacking threat Munich offer, the Gunners defence will be happy to have him calling the shots behind them again. \nStick with Walcott or go direct with Giroud? \nWalcott has quickly developed his central striker role after being given the opportunity of a run of matches for club and country. While somewhat subdued against Watford, his pace remains a potent weapon for the Gunners, especially should Bayern not sit deep and press. However, Giroud showed with his instinctive finish after coming off the bench to net at Vicarage Road that he still offers plenty around the box - not to mention in the air for the 6ft 4ins French forward. \nGive Ozil a free hand \nClub-record signing Ozil continues to grow with each appearance and has developed an almost telepathic understanding with Sanchez. Bayern will need no warning of the talents of the German playmaker, who often unlocks a defence with a pass no-one else can see. There is a growing feeling this could be Ozil's season to shine, but questions remain over his big-game performances. What better platform than against Bayern to showcase his own special box of tricks?
