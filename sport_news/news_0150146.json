Baylor, ... more > By STEPHEN HAWKINS   \nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Even coach Art Briles finds it a bit mind-boggling that fifth-ranked Baylor is the nation’s top rushing team. \nWhat comes as no real surprise is that the Bears are still the highest-scoring team with the best overall offense. \nThe two-time defending Big 12 champions, who are off to a 3-0 start, play their league opener Saturday against Texas Tech at the Dallas Cowboys’ NFL stadium. \nTexas Tech is third nationally and second in the Big 12 with 54 points a game. That’s 10 less than Baylor, the national leader the past two seasons in scoring and total offense. \nThe Bears are averaging nearly 380 yards rushing per game. Their 767 total yards a game are 130 more than second-best TCU, which last week won 55-52 at Texas Tech \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:32:08.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
