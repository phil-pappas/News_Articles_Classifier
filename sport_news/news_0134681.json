Join the Conversation Auburn Authority Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 11:35 p.m. CDT October 22, 2015 Auburn coach Gus Malzahn talks about facing Arkansas in the second of back-to-back road games Saturday. Duane Rankin/Montgomery Advertiser \nAUBURN — Instead of the classic “one day at a time” cliché, Auburn has found comfort in looking at this football season in a month-to-month perspective. \nAfter a disappointing and turbulent opening month of the season, Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn has decided to focus on the idea of being undefeated in October. \n“We are improving,” Malzahn said Monday night on Tiger Talk, Auburn’s weekly radio show. “You can see it in practice. You can see it in our guys’ demeanor. We’re 2-0 in October. That’s kind of what we did. We said let’s put the first month behind us.” \nIn that first month of the 2015, Auburn lost in embarrassing fashion at LSU, switched starting quarterbacks and dismissed its star wide receiver D’haquille Williams . For most teams, those set of circumstances would require a reorganization of the goals and objectives for a season that was built on preseason promise and anticipation. \nThe coaching staff at Auburn (4-2, 2-1 in Southeastern Conference) is currently trying to pull any form of momentum they acquired from a 30-27 victory at Kentucky on the road again this weekend as they face Arkansas (2-4, 1-2 in SEC). \n“There's no doubt the best thing to getting better is a win; and the hardest thing to overcome is a loss,” Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said. “We're 2-0 in October, we're going to play a really good football team that's played a really tough schedule. They've played some good people. We know we're going to play our best game to date on the road Saturday morning.” Here's a look at Auburn's final defenive stop to seal a 30-27 win at Kentucky and on-field celebration. Duane Rankin/Montgomery Advertiser \nMalzahn knows this first month of the season has been rocky with Sean White trying to establish himself at quarterback earlier than anybody at Auburn, including White, thought the redshirt freshman would have to contribute. \n“Especially since he didn’t get the (starter) reps in camp, it’s probably pretty difficult for him the first couple of games,” Auburn offensive guard Alex Kozan said. “Sean is a gamer and you see that confidence in him on the sidelines and in games now. I’m really excited about Sean and he’ll continue to develop as the season goes on.” \nWhite had his best game at Kentucky with 255 yards and several big plays to senior wide receiver Ricardo Louis but the 6-foot signal caller will have to replicate that performance in Razorbacks Stadium this Saturday (11 a.m., SEC Network). \n“There's no doubt it's difficult, but I think we've gotten through some of the difficult times,” Malzahn said about the change at quarterback. “This last game was really the first time it really looked like an Auburn offense with rhythm and everything that goes with that. The challenge is to take the next step and each week play better.” \nAuburn linebacker Cameron Toney (47) celebrates as the Tigers leave the field after beating Kentucky 30-27 on Thursday in Lexington, Ky.

Despite a first month where he said he’d never been through something like this slide as a defensive coordinator, Will Muschamp is also believing in the new calendar month bringing new results with his players as well. \n“October always has been a big month for us and it was kind of rough getting to October but coach got up here the first of October and told us this is the turnaround point right now,” Auburn defensive lineman DaVonte Lamber t said, “That's what we're focusing on right now - winning October.” \nWith the near certainty of heavy rain in the forecast in Fayetteville, Arkansas, Auburn will have to deal with the largest offensive line in the SEC and be sound with the football. Turnovers, or lack of them, are the final element of what Auburn has done in their Jekyll and Hyde transformation from September to October. \nAuburn has committed just one turnover in each of the last three game after being one of the nation’s worst teams in turnover margin through three games. \n“It’s a very huge factor and really reflects winning anytime you protect the football,” Malzahn said. “Our penalties have gone down, too. Anytime you protect the football and don’t have a lot of penalties, usually good things are going to happen.” Auburn OC Rhett Lashlee talks about Kentucky win and Arkansas matchup.
