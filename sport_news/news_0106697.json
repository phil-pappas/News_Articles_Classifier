And the former BCS computers have a new No. 1 in the state of Michigan, too.\nTCU supplanted Ohio State for No. 1 in the newest CFCC, though the Horned Frogs' ranking also reflects what is becoming a strong narrative in the 2015 season: No person and no computer can agree on what is the FBS' best team.\nThis week, for the first time this season, the five formulas that used to contribute to the BCS have five different No. 1 teams. TCU is No. 1 in Richard Billingsley 's rankings, Utah is No. 1 in Wes Colley 's rankings, Baylor is No. 1 in Ken Massey 's rankings, Alabama is No. 1 in Jeff Sagarin 's rankings, and Ohio State is No. 1 in Peter Wolfe 's rankings.\nTCU was ranked no lower than fifth in any formula and rose two places to the top spot this week not only because it keeps winning, Massey said, but because the Horned Frogs are winning against good competition. Texas' win against Oklahoma on Saturday boosted TCU because TCU has a 43-point win against the Longhorns this season.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. The Horned Frogs and Ohio State are clear No. 1 and 2 teams, with Alabama, Florida, Utah and Baylor tightly bunched behind them, in that order.\nMeanwhile, a third milestone occurred in this week's rankings: Michigan is ahead of Michigan State for the first time. The Wolverines jumped 11 spots to No. 9 after shutting out previously unbeaten Northwestern on Saturday. Only three one-hundredths of a place separated Michigan and Michigan State, who meet at 3:30 p.m. Saturday in Ann Arbor.\nWashington, which upset USC on Oct. 8, made the biggest leap of any team this week, jumping 21 spots to No. 34. The Huskies' opponent Saturday, Oregon, had the biggest fall, dropping 24 spots to No. 47 after losing at home in double overtime to Washington State on Oct. 10. Oregon was the computers' No. 4 team in the preseason, and it has fallen every week but one (Week 5, when it won at Colorado) ever since.\nThe College Football Computer Composite combines five of the computer formulas used in the former Bowl Championship Series standings to remove the human element from college football rankings. It is compiled by taking the geometric mean of rankings formulated by Billingsley, Colley, Massey, Sagarin and Wolfe. Among the metrics feeding the CFCC are wins and losses, strength of schedule, home-field advantage, recency of game and, in Massey and Sagarin's case, margin of victory.\nUpdated CFCC rankings are published each week during the season on FootballFour.com . The complete ranking of all 128 FBS teams is below.\n139 CONNECT 56 TWEET LINKEDIN 13 //usat.ly/1LqXz2e", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1767cd4795e116ed751df1021d32917c7a457a84/c=561-85-2131-1266&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802106276661206-USP-NCAA-FOOTBALL-TEXAS-CHRISTIAN-AT-KANSAS-STATE-76648172.JPG", "http://footballfour.usatoday.com/", "http://usat.ly/1LqXz2e", "http://imgur.com/7S1fhe5.png", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LqXz2e&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802106276661206-USP-NCAA-FOOTBALL-TEXAS-CHRISTIAN-AT-KANSAS-STATE-76648172.JPG", "http://prwolfe.bol.ucla.edu/cfootball/home.htm", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802106276661206-USP-NCAA-FOOTBALL-TEXAS-CHRISTIAN-AT-KANSAS-STATE-76648172.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768715971618409-football-four-promo2.jpg", "http://archive.azcentral.com/ic/news/projects/css/linkset.css", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LqXz2e&text=A%20new%20No.%201%20team%20in%20the%20College%20Football%20Computer%20Composite&via=enquirer", "http://cfrc.com/", "http://www.colleyrankings.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:39:44.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
