They challenged. They played with a purpose in order to keep NIACC from leaving Ottumwa with a regional men’s soccer win on Saturday. \nDespite all the best efforts by the Indian Hills Warriors, one mistake is all it took for NIACC to get the only goal they would need to earn just their third regional win of the season. Dion Dozzell scored in the 30th minute of a match after a foul was whistled on the IHCC defense in the box, allowing the visiting Trojans to hold on for what would be a disappointing 1-0 loss for the Warriors and first-year head coach Jared Beauchamp. \n“The guys played with a lot of passion, but we couldn’t make up for one questionable mistake we made on defense,” Beauchamp said. “It’s frustrating that little things are still keeping us from more wins this late in the season.” \nSix different Warriors took shots with three finding their way to NIACC goalie Colin Anderson. The last shot came with less than 10 seconds left, but was easily scooped up by Anderson who shared a few hugs with his Trojan teammates before booting the ball downfield as time expired. \nIHCC matched the Trojans early attacks with several of their own in the second half. The Warriors hurt themselves with a pair of yellow cards, one less than NIACC, and the whistled foul that led to Dozzell’s decisive goal. \nThe loss all but ends any chance the IHCC men would have of moving up into the top half of the Region XI standings as the Warriors trail fourth-place Iowa Central by three games with two matches left. Indian Hills (5-10, 4-8) will host the Tritons on Tuesday in a rematch of an overtime thriller between the two teams played last month in Fort Dodge. \nScott Jackson can be reached at sjackson@ottumwacourier.com .
