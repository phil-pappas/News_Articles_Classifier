It was Enders' eighth win of the season, the most ever for a female in the NHRA.\nEnders, who turned 32 this month, said she wanted it more because of the trash talking going on in the pit area and the gamesmanship she faced on the track where temps were warming up the 1,000-foot concrete to more than 100 degrees.\nIt was almost like the plot point of Right on Track , the Disney Channel original movie that was based on the life of Enders and her sister Courtney. In the movie, the Enders girls had trouble being accepted for their racing prowess.\nAgainst some of her competitors Sunday, the talk and gamesmanship only motivated Enders.\n\"We just decided to rise above it and let the scoreboard do our talking,\" she said. \"You can bet your butt that when I went out there, that there was a little bit of extra want for that round win.\"\nTo make matters worse, Enders said second-round challenger Chris McGaha jumped at the line, prompting two starting bulbs to flash. It's a strategy similar to a football team on offense trying to entice the defense to jump offsides.\nEnders didn't bite. Rather, she \"double-0'd on the tree\", meaning her reaction time was spot-on at .008 seconds. That gave her the impetus to flash past McGaha, a fellow Texan from Odessa.\n\"We were able to send them packing, which was a huge round for us,\" she said. \"After that, it became fun again.\"\nAlso collecting Stetsons were Del Worsham in Funny Car, Richie Crampton in Top Fuel and Jerry Savoie in Pro Stock Motorcycle.\nWorsham defeated his rival, Jack Beckman, with a run of 4.041 seconds at 272.17 mph. Worsham defeated John Hale of Addison in his first race of the day. Worsham also outlasted Austin resident Alexis DeJoria and Ron Capps.\nWorsham and Beckman, who live within 22 miles of each other in California, are 1-2 in the points standings.\nCrampton topped Steve Torrence of Kilgore in the final with a 3.972 run at 283.07 mph. The Adelaide, Australia, native moves to third in the points standings behind Antron Brown and Austin resident Tony Schumacher.\nSavoie, an alligator farmer from Cut Off, La., turned in a 6.744 run at 198.44 mph to defeat Eddie Krawiec.\nThe Countdown to the Championship series continues Oct. 29-Nov. 1 in Las Vegas for the NHRA Toyota Nationals.\nI'm so blessed and so thankful for my guys!! And thank you to my great fans!! â¤ï¸ðŸ #NHRA #AAAFallNats pic.twitter.com/DgXaJ3MX6j\n— Erica Enders-Stevens (@erica_enders) October 18, 2015 Update, 3 p.m. Sunday: Houston native Erica Enders topped No. 1 seed Drew Skillman to reach the Pro Stock final Sunday afternoon.

Torrence, who is ninth in the standings, defeated Clay Millican.\nIn the Pro Stock Motorcycle class, top seed Jerry Savoie pushed his Suzuki to a 198.99 mph and an elapsed time of 6.753, both track records, to reach the final opposite No. 2 seed Eric Krawiec.\nOriginal post: Compared with baseball, it was like mowing down the top of the order -- and a plus-one.
