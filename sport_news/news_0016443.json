Platini says the money was unpaid additional salary from his job as Sepp Blatter’s adviser between 1998 and 2002 which FIFA could not afford to pay at the time. But a written contract has not been produced for FIFA ethics investigators. \n“At the UEFA meeting on Thursday the FA learnt more information relating to the issues at the center of this case from Mr. Platini’s lawyers,” the FA said in a statement. \nJordanian federation head Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, who the FA backed in the May presidential election, is running again. But Asian Football Confederation Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalif, who endorsed Platini’s campaign in July, is now also considering submitting his candidacy for the February 26 election. \nGiven that Platini will be suspended at the time election integrity checks are conducted, it seems unlikely that the former France captain can be declared a candidate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:30:43.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
