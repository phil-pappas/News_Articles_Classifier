She’s really learned how to even if it’s out of system and our offense is out of rotation to really deliver a good ball to our hitters to put it away.” \nThe Seahawks setter shared the wealth with fellow seniors Ellen Almanza and Taylor Hodge, who paced BSA with eight and five kills, respectively, in a 25-20, 25-14 victory over Veritas. Freshman Lindsey Hornberger also added five kills.

We played hard defense, which really helps with our offense to get good passes up,” Zaremba said. “Then our hitters are great. Get them good sets, and they will kill it every time.” \nThe sweep over Veritas to conclude the triangular pushed Seabury’s record to 6-0 at home for the season and 23-12 overall. Leuty could not think of a better way to send off seniors Zaremba, Hodge, Almanza, Olivia Quinn and Isabella Mejia in their final home triangular. \n“They are the winningest class in Seabury history,” Leuty said. “They pretty much hold every single record that we own, so to end their career at home on this note, I’m really happy for them.” \nThe rivalry match between the Seahawks and Eagles certainly did not lack intensity, whether it was between the fans, players or coaches. The match was delayed twice — once after Veritas sophomore Chloe Holland was brought to tears between sets after some comments from the BSA student section, and in the second when there was a debate over the correct score. Holland did not share what was said to her but did say that the match against the Seahawks would be a good teaching point for Veritas (15-15). \n“They’re our town rivals. It just is heated in the gym,” said Holland, who had 10 total kills and seven aces on the night. “We weren’t communicating with each other, but I think we played hard and did all we could.” \nLeading up to the matchup between Seabury and Veritas, the two city schools both took care of business against Kansas City East. \nThe Seahawks swept the Lions (25-22, 27-25) behind 22 assists from Zaremba. Almanza and Hodge were on the other end of most of Zaremba’s passes, putting away 11 and six kills respectively. Hodge also highlighted the match with five aces, all of which came in a 7-0 run in the second set. \n“She leads the region in aces,” Leuty said of Hodge. “She’s probably over 100 now, actually, on the season. She has just been our best server since her freshman year.” Photo by Nick Krug Veritas Christian School players Emma Wilson (23) and Brienne Billings (25) get up to block a shot from KC East Christian Academy's Erica Carlberg on Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015 at Seabury. \nThe Eagles fought for a three-set comeback win over KC East (15-25, 25-26, 25-22). \nVCA was sluggish out of the gates offensively, and assistant coach Kim Swisher was not shy about letting the Seahawks know about it. VCA head coach Kyle Billings shared his assistant’s sentiments following the triangular. \n“It’s just sometimes we’re just watching and not going after it,” Billings said. “Our reacting was late or not reacting at all. It just took a little bit of a wakeup call for a couple of girls.” \nThe Eagles started clicking once sophomore setter Emma Wilson answered Billings and Swisher’s call to be quicker to the ball, and VCA evened up at a set apiece. Holland then took charge in the third set by serving the Eagles to a 13-0 lead, which included six aces. \n“You definitely have to be calm and block out everything around you, and just think, ‘just in,’” Holland said. “I guess that’s what happened. I got lucky.” \nDespite the big advantage in the final set, the win did not come easy for Veritas. The Lions won 13 out of the next 17 points to pull within 17-13 before the Eagles pushed the lead back eight with a 5-1 run. KC East cut the deficit to two points, but never took the lead. \n“I knew that when it was 12, 13-0, that it wasn’t going to be a 25-10 game. I knew they’d come back and I knew we’d get a little bit scared because we had a big lead,” Billings said. “I knew we’d lose it (momentum). It’s exciting ball when you win games or lose games by two points in the third game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:01:57.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
