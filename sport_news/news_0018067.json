When Ava Scott-Moncrief delivered a perfect corner to Shelby Jennings, who converted with a delightful header, the Blazers took the lead, 1-0. \nAfter the first goal of the game, the Bulldogs (4-9-1, 4-3-1 GSC) looked to bounce back immediately. Union’s best striker,Honeye Heydari, took a risky shot on VSU’s goal at the 7:18 minute mark, but goalkeeper McCall Gardner proved to be too strong. \nThe attempt sparked a flurry of offensive attempts by Union. During the first half, the Bulldogs compiled ten shots, which challenged Gardner for five of her eight saves on the night. \nThe pressure on VSU’s goal continued in the second half, but the defensive performance by the Blazers held strong until the final two minutes. \nWith only 1:30 left in the game, Georgia Hopkins scored her first goal with an outstanding shot from outside the 18-yard box. The Bulldogs used the momentum to set up one more chance in the box at the 89:28 mark, and Heydari stuck a ball into the far corner of the net to give Union the lead with only 32 seconds left in the game. The Blazers were not able to respond and ran out of time, resulting in the heartbreaking 2-1 defeat. \nValdosta State’s next matchup will be another road trip to Carrolton, where the Blazers will take on conference foe West Georgia on Tuesday at 7 p.m. Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:31:19.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
