Colton Massengale gained 180 yards and a touchdown on 34 carries and Dalton Jack rushed for 80 yards and two scores. \nJayce Knight had four catches for 114 yards, including a 34-yard touchdown catch from Tanner Jansen. \nMyers finished 6-of-18 through the air for 80 yards and three interceptions before leaving with an injury in the third quarter. \nColin Lourens had 77 yards on three catches for the Tigerhawks, who rushed for negative-11 yards. \nJacob Lietz and Jacob Buehrer led the Colfax-Mingo defense with 11 and nine tackles, respectively. \nAlan Wheeler and sophomore Jarod Nichols each had 5.5 tackles. \nThe Tigerhawks can finish the regular season 7-2 with a road win over Green Mountain-Garwin (1-7) Friday. \nThat overall mark would be the best for Colfax-Mingo since the Tigerhawks went 9-1 in 2003, and the second most wins since the 1985 Colfax-Mingo merger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:16:10.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
