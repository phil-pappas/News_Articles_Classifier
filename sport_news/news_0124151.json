Fatima led 2-0, but a pair of walks and a sacrifice bunt had Helias runners at second and third with one out. \nHaley Kempker of the Lady Crusaders hit a fly ball to Raegan Huhn in right field, who then gunned a throw to the plate to get the Helias baserunner for a double play to end the threat. \n“I thought we had a run there, but they made a great play,” Campbell said. “The first run always seems to be the hardest one to get and we thought we’d get one there.” \nFrom there, Berhorst retired the next nine Helias batters to close out the victory. \n“We got the momentum going our way and we kept it going,” Scheppers said. \nFatima got on the board in the first. Sammey Bunch hit the first pitch for a ground-rule double under the fence in right-center. She stole third before coming home on an Erin Eichholz sacrifice bunt. \nBunch had two hits, two stolen bases and two runs scored in the game. \n“That’s why we have her in the leadoff position,” Scheppers said, “When she gets on, we can usually bring her home.” \nA pair of walks had Helias runners at first and second with two outs in the bottom of the first, but Berhorst responded with a strikeout to end the threat. \nThe Lady Comets staged a two-out rally in the top of the fourth to take a 2-0 lead when Erica Fick doubled and scored when Makayla Buscher followed with a single. \nAfter getting the double play to end the fourth, the Lady Comets picked up an insurance run in the fifth. Bunch reached on a fielder’s choice, stole second and scored on a single by Eichholz. \nBerhorst tossed a two-hitter, walking four and recording four strikeouts as Fatima gained a measure of revenge after falling 4-3 to Helias last month in Westphalia. \n“She’s been pitching well, but she’s gotten more confident and comfortable recently and is doing a wonderful job,” Scheppers said. \nLindsey Steinbeck was the losing pitcher for Helias. She went the distance, allowing seven hits and no walks while striking out three. \nHelias wraps up the regular season with a mark of 16-10. The Lady Crusaders open Class 3 District 10 Tournament play Thursday at Eldon. Helias is the No. 2 seed behind Bolivar and will face the Southern Boone-Buffalo winner at 7 p.m. \nFatima (16-9) will close the regular season Monday at home against Owensville. \n“I hope this win gives us some momentum and carries over into next week and into the postseason,” Scheppers said. \nThe Lady Comets are the No. 1 seed in the Class 2 District 10 Tournament at Linn. After a first-round bye, Fatima will face either New Bloomfield or Belle at 4:30 p.m. Thursday. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:40:48.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
