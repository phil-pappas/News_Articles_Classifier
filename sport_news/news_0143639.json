Led by their No. 1 man Collin Fitzpatrick’s 38 points on an even-par 36, the Bulldogs beat the previously undefeated Apponequet Lakers 178-146 Friday on a breezy afternoon at the Lakeville Country Club. The 178 Modified Stableford System points were the most for the team this season. “Even if we were playing well, I don’t think we would have beat (178),” said Apponequet's No. 2, Mike Prescott, who shot a 44. Fitzgerald hit a 40-plus foot eagle putt on the Par 5 fifth hole for eight points, essentially cementing his place as the match’s top scorer. “I was trying to be as aggressive as possible. I knew they put up big scores here, so I was going to have to perform,” said Fitzpatrick. “Off the first tee I had a really good shot so I was confident with my swing. The eagle helped, definitely. The first four holes I didn’t hit many greens, but I was able to hit some four footers that kept me going.” “It was good to see,” said Old Rochester coach Chris Cabe. “He had a little run last week where he was shooting some higher scores. He came back and he fought back. The kid’s a workhorse. He goes out and works on his swing. And then he goes out and does what he did today.” Jacob Yeomans shot a 38 (32 points) for the Bulldogs, and Tyler Mourao shot a 39 (32 points). No Apponequet golfers finished in the 30s, with Mike Cody shooting the team’s lowest score with a 41, recording a team-best 27 points. “It’s a very score-able course,” said Cabe. “I talked to the kids about just playing smart, don’t get down on themselves if they have a bad hole. I said ‘Go out there and play the course and don’t worry about what their opponents are doing.’” Rose said the windy conditions on the course made it difficult to play. “If you shoot a low round today, you’re doing something,” said Rose. FAMOUS FATHER: Apponequet No. 1 Tim Curran is the son of CSNNE’s Patriots Insider Tom Curran. Despite the loss, the younger Curran was in good spirits following the match. “I was real confident coming into the match, but after seeing (Fitzpatrick’s) silky smooth swing on the first tee, I knew we were in trouble.” (ALMOST) HOLE-IN-ONE: Apponequet sub Cam Sheedy hit his tee shot in the hole on the 170-yard par 3 seventh for a par after hitting his first shot in the water. SUPER SOPHMORES: Both Mourao and Yeomans are only sophomores, with Old Rochester having only one senior on the team in Jared Nye. CABE ON MOURAO: “He’s been very consistent, and he usually rises to the occasion for these bigger matches.” CABE ON YEOMANS: “He’s another kid who’s been working hard all season long. He’s been hanging around the 40 mark. It was good to see him break that today.” WHAT IT MEANS: The win assures Old Rochester (15-1, 14-0 SCC) a shot at the South Coast Conference Championship. The two teams face off Thursday against each other in a match that could decide the conference’s champion pending the results of Wednesday’s matches, with Apponequet (13-1, 13-1 SCC) facing off against Dighton-Rehobeth and the Bulldogs against Case.
