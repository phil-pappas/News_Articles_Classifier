USC is reportedly interested in a number of NFL head coaches to potentially fill the same role with the Trojans next season, and one of the names may surprise you.\nAdChoices According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport , USC is interested in speaking to New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton. Multiple NFL teams are also expected to reach out to Payton, and there is growing speculation that he could be open to leaving New Orleans .\nThere are a number of things that make Payton an intriguing candidate. Perhaps the most important is that his daughter goes to Pepperdine University, which is located about 30 minutes from the USC campus. Also, since Payton is unlikely to be fired, the 51-year-old could make the move to USC simply by working out a buyout with the Saints. There would not need to be any “trade” or compensation like there would be if he took another NFL job.\nRapoport also notes that Chip Kelly would have “some interest” in the USC job, despite the comments the Philadelphia Eagles coach made earlier this week . Another name that has been tossed around is John Harbaugh, though he has also denied interest.\nThe USC coaching job is one of the few college jobs that could entice NFL coaches. And after what happened with Steve Sarkisian (you can read some of the disturbing stories here ), the Trojans would love to bring in a strong leader with a proven track record.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-network-gameday/0ap3000000559213/Rapoport-Three-NFL-coaches-in-the-frame-for-the-USC-head-coaching-search", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/chip-kelly-shoots-down-usc-rumors/278030", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/steve-sarkisian-alcohol-use-washington/277659", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/sean-payton-open-leaving-saints/278073", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:50:02.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
