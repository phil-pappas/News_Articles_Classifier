And so they worked out huge bust Trent Richardson on Tuesday. \nRichardson, the No. 3 overall draft pick in 2012, has averaged 3.3 yards per carry over this three-year NFL career with the Browns and Colts. After getting dumped by Indianapolis following the 2014 season, Richardson tried to sign on with the Oakland Raiders but didn’t make it past the first round of cuts in training camp. \nAccording to NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport , former Colts running back Boom Herron also got a workout in Buffalo. The Bills list Boobie Dixon (eight carries for zero yards this season) and Cierre Woods as the remaining running backs on their depth chart. \nAlso, this: If Ray Rice can’t get a workout with the Bills and Trent Richardson can, you really know it’s over. \n— Dan Hanzus (@DanHanzus) October 6, 2015 After spending the first 17 years of his Post career writing and editing, Matt and the printed paper had an amicable divorce in 2014.
