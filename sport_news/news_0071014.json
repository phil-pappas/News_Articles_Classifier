(AP) â€” Seattle Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman was suspended indefinitely by the team Thursday after his arrest in a hit-and-run investigation.\nColeman was booked into King County Jail in Seattle early Thursday and bail was denied until his first court appearance. He was arrested by Bellevue police but details were not immediately available. An afternoon news conference was scheduled.\nColeman's agents said in a statement \"it seems Derrick may have fallen asleep while driving home from a Seahawks' facility.\"\nThe King County prosecutor's office said that because Coleman was not booked until after midnight his initial court appearance will be Friday at the earliest. He is being investigated for vehicular assault and felony hit and run.\nBellevue police described the accident on Twitter shortly after it happened Wednesday night as a \"heavy rescue.\" A police photo of the scene showed one vehicle on its roof on a steep, grassy embankment and another across a hedge, on its side on the roadway below.\nColeman is in his fourth season with the Seahawks. He was on the practice squad in 2012 before making the 53-man roster in 2013. Coleman missed 11 games and the playoffs last season because of a broken foot.\nColeman is legally deaf and his football success has made him an inspirational figure. He has been featured in TV commercials and written a book that was released this year.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
