He recently was diagnosed with Bovine Leukemia Virus. (Photo: Eric Gay, AP)\nUniversity of Texas mascot BEVO XIV, who recently was diagnosed with Bovine Leukemia Virus, died in his sleep Friday, the school announced.\n\"BEVO XIV was so much more than a traditional mascot — he was so big and strong, but he had such a sweet personality and a gentle soul,\" said Ricky Brennes, Executive Director of the Silver Spurs and BEVO XIV's regular traveling partner. \"He loved the attention that came with being BEVO but was very cool, calm and smart. Like a dog he would come when called by name, show up to the house looking for treats and even roll over on his side so Mrs. Baker could rub his belly. He did so much for his university and community. His last few days provided great memories, but we miss him already.\"\nThe search for BEVO XV will begin immediately.\nThe school hopes Bevo's replacement will be on the sidelines for the 2016 football season, including Thanksgiving, the 100th anniversary of the mascot's first appearance at a Texas Football game.\nBevo XIV had served as the school mascot since the age of 2 in 2004 and was on the football sideline for two Rose Bowl victories, including the January 2006 national championship game.\nHe also attended the second inauguration of President George W. Bush in January 2005.\nMay you rest in peace, @Bevo_XIV . Thanks for the memories, and your legacy will reign on: http://t.co/I4kl795fKX pic.twitter.com/oGLt6qMnS4\n— UT Austin (@UTAustin) October 16, 2015 .\n //usat.ly/1LxX1aO", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1LxX1aO", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8d1ed51f2ccab30abbad3ee3a962cfbaac394d9d/c=187-0-3859-2761&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805970238639922-C02-BEVO-1008-76249624.JPG", "https://twitter.com/UTAustin/status/655059588946001920", "http://t.co/I4kl795fKX", "https://twitter.com/BEVO_XIV", "http://t.co/oGLt6qMnS4"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:43:52.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
