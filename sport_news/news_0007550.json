The Blackhawks won 4-1. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Patrick Kane on opposing fan reaction to him: \"I don't think it's anything that really bothers me.\" \nThere would be boos and there would be chants. \nThe Blackhawks, Patrick Kane and the NHL knew there would be reaction from opposing fans when Kane skated in opponents' buildings as he continues to play while under investigation for an alleged sexual assault stemming from an incident in early August at his home in western New York. \n\"I've come to expect that on the road, especially this season,\" Kane said Saturday before the Hawks' 4-1 victory over the Blue Jackets at the United Center. \"I don't think it's anything that really bothers me.\" \nIf the league, Kane or the Hawks were worried fans would pour it on Kane or were worried about a public relations backlash, there seems now to be no need for concern judging from the response of road crowds. \nAfter playing in New York, Philadelphia and Washington, the collective response from opposing fans to Kane's presence on the ice has been mild irritation with a collective shrug. \nIn New York on Oct. 9 at the Barclays Center, a pocket of Islanders fans booed Kane, while a small section took to yelling \"No means no,\" a chant that came off as sophomoric and insensitive given the gravity of the allegations Kane is facing. \nAll the action from United Center. \nIslanders fans seemed more concerned with the absence of the team's ice girls, a cheerleading squad the team disbanded this offseason. You could hear \"We want ice girls\" more clearly than anything else in the arena. \nThe response was strongest from Flyers fans at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Kane was booed almost every time he touched the puck, but that is a response Kane has been getting since scoring the game-winning goal against the Flyers in the 2010 Stanley Cup Final. The fans in Philadelphia were also the most vocal, chanting \"She said no\" a handful of times. \n\"I went through it maybe once before in Winnipeg when I got booed when I touched the puck,\" Kane said. \"It almost makes you want to play a little bit better and have the puck a little more and hold on to it I don't think it's anything that's really going to affect me.\" \nThe response was weakest in Washington at the Verizon Center. There were a few half-hearted boos from Capitals fans, but in general they seemed not to care. \nKane said he had steeled himself against potential negative reaction and used that as motivation on the ice. He had scored three goals through five games entering Saturday. Outside of a short question-and-answer session in New York, Kane also did not face a crush of media in each city asking him questions about the investigation before each game. \n\"There are some passionate fans and some places that are going to be worse than others,\" Kane said. \"So you saw in Washington there really wasn't much. I didn't really hear much in New York, even though I guess there were some different things. Philly you can hear different things. I guess certain cities are worse than others.\" \nKane said he had noticed a decrease in the attention he has received since Thomas Eoannou, an attorney representing the accuser, withdrew after a bizarre series of news conferences in which the mother of the accuser claimed an evidence bag had been tampered with, an allegation district attorney Frank Sedita III refuted. Sedita eventually will decide whether the case will go before a grand jury. Until then, Kane will keep skating, and the reactions will continue, however muted they may be. \n\"I have to answer questions about it,\" Kane said. \"Not much I can really say except I didn't do anything wrong. Other than that, we'll leave it up to everyone else to make those decisions with what comes next and what happens.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:24:05.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
