(No boss or divorce lawyer jokes needed)\nThe Aquarium of Canada next to the CN Tower and Rogers Centre has what’s billed as “North America’s longest underwater viewing tunnel.”\nStroll surrounded by more than 5.7 million litres of water and get as close as anyone should to horseshoe crabs and rays.\nCN Tower\nYou don’t need directions to this landmark .\nJust look up – 356m (1,136’) up.\nYou can get to the top in 58 seconds.\nOnce there, you have a choice of dining, taking photos, or dangling from a rope on EdgeWalk.\nLeon’s furniture store\nLooking for a sleeper set or a La-Z-Boy?\nDon’t want the type that you find patrolling the Leafs’ defense line?\nThere’s always Leon’s , the priced-to-sell furniture store in the old rail roundhouse, above retired rail tracks.\nIf you can stay awake on a Lazy Boy, the sightlines of the city are spectacular.\nThe Royal Alexandra Theatre\nThis King St. W. building is a National Historic Landmark buildin g that’s now home to Kinky Boots, with music and lyrics from pop star Cyndi Lauper.\nThe Star’s Richard Ouzounian clearly found it to his liking, calling it a “spectacular celebration of song, dance and comedy.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.cntower.ca/en-ca/plan-your-visit/attractions/lookout.html", "https://www.ripleyaquariums.com/canada/", "http://steamwhistle.ca/", "http://www.mirvish.com/theatres/royalalexandratheatre", "http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://www.leons.ca/search/furniture/living-room/recliners"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:33:02.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
