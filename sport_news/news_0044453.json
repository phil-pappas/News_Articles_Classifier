As Texas starts over again, Fenves would be wise to do what Powers neglected to doâ”make the obvious hire in Oliver Luck.\"\nHe also said that the Longhorns' overlooked Luck's rÃ©sumÃ© which featured both athletic and business experience. Thamel said Texas will now have to look at an athletic director candidate like Luck, Kansas State's John Currie, Arizona's Greg Byrne, Louisville's Tom Jurich or Mississippi State's Scott Stricklin.\nWhoever the Longhorns decide to hire, they'll have to fix the errors Patterson made during his 22-month tenure at Texas.\n\"Patterson now leaves bullet holes that will require more than a few Band-Aids to fix,\" Thamel wrote. \"His era blew up in such a fantastic mushroom cloud of donor angst, season-ticket-holder revolt and awkwardly handled firings that the mess he inherited actually gets overlooked ... Patterson's tenure is a reminder that charm and warmth are still part of the job description for college athletics, no matter how big the business has gotten.\"\nClick here to read full Sports Illustrated story\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/college-football/2015/09/15/steve-patterson-fired-texas-athletic-director-oliver-luck-mack-brown?xid=si_social", "https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:04:31.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
