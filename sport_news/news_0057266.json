After tying TCU in the vote last week, Baylor's dismantling of Kansas and TCU's escape from Kansas State pushed the Bears over the top.\nBut how long can that keep up? Baylor has a tilt with West Virginia on Saturday -- the same Mountaineers team that handed the Bears their only Big 12 lost a season ago.\nTCU, meanwhile, is just trying to win each week and isn't going for style points, coach Gary Patterson recently said. It's showing on the field and in the Best in Texas poll. The good news: Baylor and TCU can settle things on the field Nov. 27.\nHere's a look at this week's Best in Texas poll, which is voted on by the Dallas Morning News' college insiders and bloggers, as well as Denton Record-Chronicle's Brett Vito. Make sure to check out how each writer voted, and the breakdown, here.\n1. Baylor, 129 points (8 first-place votes) Baylor Bears (5-0, 2-0 big 12) / Last: Beat Kansas, 66-7 / Next: vs. West Virginia, 11 a.m. Saturday at McLane Stadium in Waco.\nBaylor dominated Kansas in every phase of the game this weekend on the road in Lawrence, Kan. The Bears held Kansas to only 227 yards on the day and scored 66 points despite pulling their first team offense at the start of the second half. After the performance, the Bears moved up to No. 2 in both national polls, behind only Ohio State. Baylor has not played much competition, but it has looked like the most complete team in football this season. -- Shehan Jeyarajah\n2. TCU, 122 (3)\nTCU Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12) / Last: Beat Kansas State, 52-45 / Next: at Iowa State, 6 p.m. Saturday at Jack Trice Stadium in Ames, Iowa:\nTCU survived yet another scare on the road, rallying to beat K-State behind the fourth-quarter heroics of quarterback Trevone Boykin and wide receiver Josh Doctson, who hooked up for the game-winning touchdown with less than 90 seconds to play. Earlier in the fourth quarter, Boykin rushed for two scores to pull TCU out of a double-digit deficit. That a Bill Snyder-coached team could threaten TCU's unblemished record in such a hostile environment, however, is not exactly incomprehensible. TCU took the best shot a solid, sound program had to offer and kept its College Football Playoff hopes alive. The Horned Frogs should experience fewer troubles at 2-3 Iowa State before returning to Amon G. Carter Stadium for a showdown with West Virginia on Oct. 29. -- Jose Rodriguez\n3. Texas A&M, 112 Texas A&M Aggies (5-0, 2-0 SEC) / Last: Bye / Next: vs. Alabama, 2:30 p.m. Saturday in College Station.\nThe Aggies had the week off to prepare for their upcoming game with Alabama. The Tide handled the Arkansas Razorbacks, 27-14, Saturday in Tuscaloosa and will now make the trip from Bryant-Denny to Kyle Field for a top 10 conference matchup. Alabama won 59-0 in last year's contest, signaling the end of the Kenny Hill era. His replacement, Kyle Allen, will get his first crack at Nick Saban's squad as A&M aims to remain perfect on the season. -- Brandon Wheeland\n4. Texas Tech, 96 Texas Tech Red Raiders / (4-2, 1-2 Big 12) / Last: Beat Iowa State, 66-31 / Next: at Kansas, 11 a.m. Saturday at Memorial Stadium in Lawrence, Kan.\nTexas Tech's Big 12 losses to top-five TCU and Baylor showed it isn't at the top of the class in the conference. The Red Raiders' 35-point win over Iowa State on Saturday showed they are far from the bottom, something that couldn't be said last season. Tech, which racked up 776 yards of offense against Iowa State, equaled its win total from a year ago with another dazzling performance from quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Co. The defense, while gashed on the ground to the tune of 315 yards, forced three turnovers to show it can give its offense enough extra possessions to still cruise to victory when surrendering 31 points. -- Tommy Magelssen\n5. Houston, 87 Houston Cougars (5-0, 2-0 AAC) / Last: Beat SMU, 49-28 / Next: at Tulane, 8 p.m. Friday at Yulman Stadium in New Orleans.\nHouston fired Tony Levine last year despite the fact the Cougars made it to a bowl game. While some people questioned the decision, Houston felt it could do even better with the right person at the helm. And so far, the Cougars are proving themselves right. New head coach Tom Herman has brought a new swagger to H-Town, and the Cougars are still undefeated after romping SMU on national television last week. Houston is now ranked No. 24 in the latest AP poll and might be the best Group of 5 team in the nation. With dual-threat quarterback Greg Ward leading the way on offense and the defense playing well, Houston is the favorite to win the AAC title. -- EJ Holland\n6. Texas, 81 Texas Longhorns (2-4, 1-2 Big 12) / Last: Beat Oklahoma, 24-17/ Next: Bye.\nThe Longhorns upset the Sooners Saturday in the Red River Showdown to secure their second win of the season. Texas held Oklahoma's passing attack in check as it sacked Sooners' quarterback Baker Mayfield six times and held him to 211 yards passing. The Longhorns had two rushers over 100 yards against Oklahoma: sophomore running back D'Onta Foreman ran for 117, while redshirt freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard chipped in 115. While Texas has struggled this year, an upset win over Oklahoma could spark a second-half run. -- Nick Castillo\n7. Rice, 65 Rice Owls (3-3, 2-1 C-SA) / Last: Defeated Florida Atlantic, 27-26 / Next: Bye.\nRice found itself trailing 26-14 against Florida Atlantic on Saturday night before a fourth-quarter rally -- capped off by an 83-yard touchdown drive -- gave the Owls a 27-26 win and brought them back to .500 for the season. Quarterback Driphus Jackson was instrumental in the victory, completing 22 of his 34 pass attempts for 284 yards and three touchdowns. Florida Atlantic's Jaquez Johnson was sacked on fourth down by Alex Lyons and Preston Gordon of Rice to secure the win. -- Brandon Wheeland\n8. SMU, 49 SMU Mustangs (1-5, 0-2 AAC) / Last: Lost to Houston, 49-28 / Next: Bye\nIt's going to take time. There was plenty of buzz surrounding SMU early in the season after the Mustangs kept it close (for a bit) against in-state powers Baylor and TCU. And while the shine has certainly come off the Pony Express, the future is still bright on the Hilltop. New head coach Chad Morris has obviously made a difference on the offensive side of the ball -- SMU has already scored more points in 2015 than it did all of last year. The defense needs a lot of work, but the cupboard was barren when Morris took over. SMU gets a much needed bye week this week and should make some noise when it returns to action Oct. 24 at South Florida. -- EJ Holland.\n9. UTSA, 45 UTSA Roadrunners / (1-5, 1-1 C-USA) / Last: Lost to Louisiana Tech, 34-31 / Next: at Southern Miss, 6 p.m. Saturday at M.M. Roberts Stadium in Hattiesburg, Miss.\nThe Roadrunners were moments from overtime Saturday before Louisiana Tech kicker Jonathan Barnes wrecked everything for UTSA. The kicker nailed a 32-yard field goal with 10 seconds left to give the Bulldogs the win and ruin UTSA's comeback bid. Dalton Sturm led the Roadrunners with 227 yards passing and four touchdowns, though he threw two interceptions. UTSA, which overcame a 24-10 halftime deficit, struggled on the ground all day, amassing 73 yards on 39 carries -- good enough for 1.9 yards per carry. The Roadrunners now must win five of their last six to reach bowl eligibility. -- Tommy Magelssen\n10. UTEP, 34 UTEP Miners (2-4, 0-2 C-USA) / Last: Lost to Florida Internationl, 52-12 / Next: Bye.\nUTEP's lack of offense caught up with it in embarrassing fashion against FIU. The Miners accumulated only 267 yards on the day, including 117 through the air. Starting quarterback Ryan Metz had 10 yards passing before throwing a pick-six at the beginning of the second quarter to give FIU a 28-0 lead. UTEP has a bye this week and needs to find some answers before FAU comes to town in two weeks. -- Shehan Jeyarajah\n11. Texas State, 27 Texas State Bobcats (1-4, 0-1 Sun Belt) / Last: Lost to Louisiana-Lafayette, 49-27 / Next: Bye.\nThe Bobcats suffered their fourth straight loss with a 49-27 defeat to the Ragin' Cajuns. Texas State statisctically has the worst defense in FBS (573.2 yards per game) and it showed against Louisiana-Lafayette. The Bobcats gave up 238 yards passing and three touchdowns to Ragin' Cajuns' quarterback Jalen Nixon. Texas State also gave up 288 yards on the ground Saturday. The Bobcats will have a chance to regroup with a bye week. -- Nick Castillo\n12. North Texas, 11 North Texas Mean Green / (0-5, 0-1 C-USA) / Last: Lost to Portland State, 66-7 / Next: vs. Western Kentucky, 6:30 p.m. Thursday at Apogee Stadium in Denton.\nNorth Texas lost in devastating fashion -- 66-7 -- to Portland State out of the Football Championship Subdivision and fired coach Dan McCarney on the spot. The Mean Green will look to regroup under interim head coach Mike Canales before Thursday night's showdown with red-hot Western Kentucky. The Hilltoppers are 5-1 and hammered rival Middle Tennessee 58-28 on Saturday. -- Brett Vito\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/12/best-texas-breakdown-1012-longhorns-reverse-recent-trend-start-climbing-poll"], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:31:25.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
