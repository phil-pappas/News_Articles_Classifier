Collectively, they have more than compensated for the graduation of Devin Clark, last year’s state champion and owner of two San Antonio-area records in track and field.\n“All of us really miss Devin,” senior Grace Hannemann said. “It’s made us realize now that we don’t have a number one (runner), we have to do the team way of winning meets. That’s made us work harder knowing we can’t depend on her anymore.”\nClark left a huge legacy. During her high school career, Clark won 11 state medals (out of a possible 12 events) and set area records in the 800 (2 minutes, 10.2 seconds) and 1,600 runs (4:42.70).\nAlthough Clark now runs for the Razorbacks, Rangers coach Brittney Lanehart said she left a lasting influence on this year’s team.\n“What we have is a lot of people who share the same personalities in how they approach the sport and the genuine love of the sport and the love of the training process,” Lanehart said. “That’s what Devin brought - the love of the process, the love of the training and the love of the fact that it hurts every day. Do we have a 4:42 miler? No, we don’t. But we have a heck of a lot of girls who can break five minutes who couldn’t have touched that a year ago.”\nHannemann is one of five members of last year’s squad that finished 13th at state. Others include senior Reagan Bachman, junior Mackenzie Jensen and sophomore twins Kylie and Kerri Welch . Junior Marisa Ibarra has returned after missing last season with an injury. Newcomers include freshmen Cambria Clark (no relation to Devin) and Daniellie Keranen.\nSmithson Valley enters the district meet with plenty of momentum. The Rangers won the Islander Splash held last month at Texas A&M-Corpus Christi by 98 points. It’s the same course that will be used for the Region IV championships on Oct. 26. Three weeks ago, the Rangers finished third at the Round Rock McNeil Invitational held at Old Settlers Park, the same site as next month’s state championships.\nBased on those performances, the Rangers could nab a spot on the podium (top three finish) at state. Over the previous two years with Clark, the Rangers finished second at regionals. They finished ninth at state in 2013.\nAs confident as they are, the Rangers are trying not to look too far ahead.\n“I didn’t expect the success that we have been having, but we know it’s not enough and we’re not there yet,” Hannemann said. “We are just beginning the championship season.”\nHowever, any reservations the team had entering the season without their star runner have been alleviated. The Rangers’ key to success is very simple.\n“Initially, we might have been a little nervous about it,” Bachman said, “but we’ve come to realize that it’s a team sport and you don’t have to have one awesome runner to win meets if everyone is working hard together.”\ndhinojosa@express-news.net\nTwitter: @hinojosa_david", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:20:33.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
