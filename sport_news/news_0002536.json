From what Zimmer has seen so far this year of his former player, Ware has discovered a fountain of youth.\n\"His first-step quickness looks exactly like I remember it,\" Zimmer said. \"When we drafted him, he was really strong in all of the combine measurements, but he is such a great athlete. I have so much respect for him.
