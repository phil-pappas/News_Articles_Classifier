The “My Drive Comes From” campaign will give all Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon runners at the race an opportunity to share unique and personal messages about what inspires them to run. Runners will be able to share their own “My Drive Comes From” motivation at the Travelers footprint at the three-day Health & Fitness Expo. There runners can promote their personal message about why they run by penning their motivation on a customized race poster, which will be photographed along with each runner and can be shared by the runner online. Additionally, runners’ photos will be posted on a custom microsite (www.mydrivecomesfrom.com), where friends and family can also post unique encouragement messages that will be shared on the actual Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon race course via a digital billboard. Runners will also be encouraged to share their photos on social media by using the hashtag #MyDriveComesFrom. Committed to raising awareness about the dangers of distracted driving, Travelers will use the campaign as a platform to highlight “the drive” of runner Joel Feldman. In 2009, Feldman lost his 21-year-old daughter Casey to a distracted driving accident. The attorney then founded EndDD.org (End Distracted Driving) to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving. Travelers will donate $100 to EndDD.org’s charitable arm, the Casey Feldman Foundation, for every mile run by Feldman and two other EndDD.org representatives throughout the race. Travelers’ donation has potential to reach more than $15,000 at the end of the campaign. Travelers will also be offering all Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon participants and their family complimentary runner tracking at the Travelers footprint at the Health & Fitness Expo at the Pennsylvania Convention Center and online at www.runnertracking.com.
