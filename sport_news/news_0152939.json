The country has been the subject of numerous allegations since German broadcaster ARD's 2012 expose claimed the blood-booster EPO and other banned substances were easily available and being used by athletes. \nIn August, two Kenyans were sent home from the world championships in Beijing for failing targeted tests, while Jeruto and Josephine Jepkoech were announced last week as the latest to be banned. \nJeptoo is the highest profile after she tested positive for EPO in an out-of-competition test in Kenya late last year. Jeruto, who was a member of the same training group, was also caught in an out-of-competition test in Kenya in April, Athletics Kenya said. \nRosa & Associati and another European-based athlete agency, Volare Sports, were suspended by local authorities from working in Kenya for six months in April pending investigations following Jeptoo's case. Those investigations should be completed by the end of this month, AK chief executive Isaac Mwangi said. Both agencies, which represent some of Kenya's top stars, deny any involvement in doping. \nMedia in Kenya have instead said doctors and pharmacists are illegally supplying banned substances to athletes for money. Last week, a Kenyan television station aired an expose where doctors were arrested on suspicion of providing doping substances out of a clinic in Nairobi. \nImray reported from Cape Town, South Africa. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:37:16.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
