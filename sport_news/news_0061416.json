The Eagles, with a Swiss cheese offensive line and quarterback nearing Cutler-esque levels of visible misery, might be changing the narrative on Chip Kelly’s genius. Then, there’s Colin Kaepernick, who clearly “ain’t Russell Wilson, bro” – and his 49ers certainly aren’t Wilson’s Seahawks.\nBy now, even unflinching optimists understand that these teams won’t be heading to Santa Clara in February.\nBut through four weeks, six teams remain undefeated, and for the most part, it’s pretty apparent why they’ve gotten this far. The Patriots and Packers are quarterbacked by two of the greatest the position has seen. The Broncos have a ruthless defense allowing just 275 yards per game. The Panthers and Falcons have beaten up on struggling divisions. And the Bengals have ... Andy Dalton.\nAnd no, that last one wasn’t a joke.\nThese six have been the class of the NFL so far, and none, at this point, should be discounted as contenders. In its season simulations, FiveThirtyEight.com predicts all six will finish over the 11-win mark and gives each at least an 80 percent chance of making the playoffs. The chance any remains undefeated a month from now, however, is obviously much smaller.\nBut that’s what we’re here to handicap today. Of these six teams, who will still look as untouchable a month from now? From least likely to most, here are my entirely unscientific predictions, now hereby christened as the Undefeated Index:\n6. CAROLINA PANTHERS \nOpening month wins: at Jaguars, vs. Texans, vs. Saints, at Buccaneers\nOn tap: at Seahawks, vs. Eagles, vs. Colts, vs. Packers\nThe Panthers have played a frighteningly easy schedule through one month, and with a murderer’s row on tap through October, it’s not entirely unlikely Carolina is sitting at .500 a month from now. Optimistically, with a middling offense, the Panthers’ chances of making it through unscathed are next to nil.\n5. DENVER BRONCOS \nOpening month wins: vs. Ravens, at Chiefs, at Lions, vs. Vikings\nOn tap: at Raiders, at Browns, vs. Packers, at Colts\nThere’s nothing illegitimate about the Broncos’ defensive dominance thus far. They boast the NFL’s best pass rush, with a league-leading 18 sacks in four games. The problem: The other side of the ball has been almost equally unimpressive , ranking 25th in total offense, despite being helmed by a future Hall of Famer. Peyton Manning has been pedestrian, and the run game has been non-existent. Denver could be a serious Super Bowl contender, but it’ll need to get Manning and the offense back on track first.\n4. GREEN BAY PACKERS \nOpening month wins: at Bears, vs. Seahawks, vs. Chiefs, at 49ers\nOn tap: vs. Rams, vs. Chargers, at Broncos, at Panthers\nI still stand by my preseason prediction that Green Bay will make the Super Bowl, but the next four weeks are going to be seriously tough sledding. Three of their next four opponents could make the playoffs, and the toughest two (Carolina and Denver) come on the road. Still, this is one of the NFL’s top offenses, run by the league’s best quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, who you can doubt at your own peril. More surprisingly, the Packers defense has been an indubitable success, allowing just 17.8 points per game.\n3. ATLANTA FALCONS \nOpening month wins: vs. Eagles, at Giants, at Cowboys, vs. Texans\nOn tap: vs. Washington, at Saints, at Titans, vs. Buccaneers\nThe Falcons might seem like obvious pretenders. Like the Panthers, they’ve had an easy draw and won their first three games by a combined 17 points. Somehow, though, the schedule gets even easier from here. Atlanta’s next four opponents have just five combined wins this season. With Devonta Freeman running as well as any NFL back, there’s no end in sight for this offensive renaissance. They still have a higher chance of a slip-up than any of the NFL’s other undefeateds, save Carolina, but the Falcons have a lot going for them.\n2. CINCINNATI BENGALS \nOpening month wins: at Raiders, vs. Chargers, at Ravens, vs. Chiefs\nOn tap: vs. Seahawks, at Bills, at Steelers, vs. Browns\nIt’s time to get on the bandwagon, y’all. Dalton is playing the best football of his life, thanks in large part to his league-best offensive line. Dalton has been pressured on just 13.5 percent of his dropbacks and sacked just twice. With that kind of time, the Bengals have been able to spread the wealth around on an offense chock full of talent. Conveniently enough, the defense has also been very good, with Geno Atkins finally back to his nightmarish self. The schedule is tough coming up, but the Bengals and their 4-0 record are as real as it gets.\n1. NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS \nOpening month wins: vs. Steelers, at Bills, vs. Jaguars\nOn tap: at Cowboys, at Colts, vs. Jets, vs. Dolphins\nNothing in the past month has suggested the current kings of the NFL should be knocked from their throne. The Patriots offense has been predictably prolific, with Tom Brady playing as well as ever. They’ve trailed for all of six minutes this season. The next month’s schedule is manageable, with only the Jets standing as a serious challenge. If the defense can improve, the question for New England won’t be whether they’ll lose in October, but if they’ll lose at all in 2015.\nContact the writer: rkartje@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:28:21.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
