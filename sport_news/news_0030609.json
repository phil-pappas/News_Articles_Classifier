The score was tied seven times, including at 10 entering the fourth period. \nWyatt scored on Mater Dei’s first possession of the fourth and moments after the Monarchs fended off the first of four power-play chances by the Wolverines in the final period. \nWyatt and center Sean Duncan each finished with four goals. Duncan also netted the tying goal with 14 seconds left in the third period. The Princeton commit made a steal, drew an exclusion and scored on a power-play to tie the score, 10-10. \nThe Monarchs finished 6 for 9 on the man-advantage while Harvard-Westlake went 2 for 8. Mater Dei goalie Nolan Strout recorded eight saves. \nIn the third-place: \nNo. 5 Huntington Beach 15, Sacred Heart Prep 6: Curtis Jarvis scored four goals and Patrick Saunders made 14 saves to lead the Oilers (19-6). \nIn the seventh-place game: \nMiramonte 11, No. 4 Dana Hills 10: Jack McLaughlin scored with 1:18 left in the fourth to draw the Dolphins (17-4) within one but they didn’t score again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:48:03.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
