Donaldson, sliding into second hard to break up a potential double play in the fourth, crashed head-first into Odor’s knee as the infielder jumped to make the throw to first.\nAdChoices Donaldson appeared shaken up by the hit, and took some time getting up before leaving the field. When he exited for a pinch hitter an inning later, most watching the game expressed concern for Toronto’s charismatic and hard-nosed MVP candidate. But one person paid to watch the game and talk about it did not.\nIn his role as an analyst for FOX Sports 1 , banned MLB hit king Pete Rose criticized Donaldson for leaving the game over something as trifling as a possible head injury. Here’s what Rose had to say, as transcribed by the good folks at Big League Stew :\nHere’s Pete Rose’s complete Quote: calling out #BlueJays Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista for leaving Game 1. pic.twitter.com/TlhKCqceSb\n— Big League Stew (@bigleaguestew) October 8, 2015\nYikes. It’s true that Rose, reputed for his toughness and hustle long before he was ever reputed as a guy who bet on baseball and spent years lying about it, might have stayed in the game after taking that hit. But it’s also true that baseball, its teams and its players have learned a heck of a lot about the terrifying potential long-term fallout from head injuries, and, in fact, that all MLB teams now operate under strict league-wide protocols when assessing any potential on-field head trauma.\nDonaldson passed his concussion test, which Rose referenced. But leaving the game to undergo the test might not have even been Donaldson’s choice, and he shouldn’t be blamed for it even if it was.\nAnd while it’s baffling enough to chastise any player for leaving a game over a concussion scare in 2015, it seems especially strange to target Donaldson, of all players. Few in baseball appear to play harder than Donaldson, who somewhat routinely risks his well-being to dive into the stands in pursuit of foul balls.\nRose’s comments were ridiculous, and, probably, the reason he’s getting paid to analyze baseball on TV. Now I’m writing about Pete Rose and you’re reading about Pete Rose when meanwhile there’s postseason baseball afoot.\n© Provided by USA Today Sports Josh Donaldson © Provided by USA Today Sports Josh Donaldson\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Carrera", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlueJays?src=hash", "http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/?nf=1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfgA1d.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfg7J5.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Donaldson", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://m.mlb.com/news/article/17183370/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://t.co/TlhKCqceSb", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfg2EK.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Thursday", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfeQSv.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAyrb0&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;George", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/bigleaguestew/status/652259021303386112"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:45:56.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
