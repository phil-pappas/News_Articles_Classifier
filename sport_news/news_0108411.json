Fredrik Claesson notched the game-winning goal 1:35 into the sudden-death overtime period to give the B-Sens the win in the first of two games in as many nights in Newfoundland. \nFollowing a scoreless opening period, Colin Greening, who finished the evening with a Gordie Howe Hat Trick, opened the scoring 1:41 into the second frame with a shorthanded goal. Patrick Mullen skated into the IceCaps zone and sent a shot that was redirected towards the corner boards where Greening was waiting to one-time it past Dustin Tokarski from a sharp angle for his second goal of the year. Bud Holloway answered for St. John’s on the power play at 7:45 of the second before back-to-back goals from Gabriel Dumont 8:21 apart made it 3-1 IceCaps. With just under one minute to play in the middle period, the B-Sens’ Eric O’Dell beat Tokarski with a wrist shot for his third marker of the year to make it 3-2 heading into the third. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nSt. John’s quickly regained their two-goal cushion just 1:35 into the third when Darren Dietz sent a slapshot from just inside the blue line to beat Binghamton’s Chris Driedger for his first goal of the year. Matt Puempel started the B-Sens’ rally with less than 10 minutes to play in regulation when he sent a feed from Mullen on the power-play over Tokarski’s glove for his first of the year. Travis Ewanyk first point as a Binghamton Senator came in the way of a game-tying redirect off of a Ben Harpur slap shot with just over three minutes to play in regulation. \nFollowing a whistle stoppage in the overtime frame, Nick Paul won the faceoff for Binghamton and pushed the puck towards the end board to Claesson who then skated around the net to complete the game-winner. \nDriedger stopped 24 of 28 shots faced to improve to 2-0-0 while Tokarski finished with five goals allowed on 37 shots to drop to 2-2-0. \nThe team’s faceoff tomorrow night in St. John’s at 6:00p.m. \n(Courtesy: Binghamton Senators)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:55:57.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
