ALEX GALLARDO, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Related article » EL SEGUNDO – The Lakers returned to their home court Thursday, but their thoughts remained in Las Vegas, where former Laker Lamar Odom remained hospitalized.\n“One of the first thoughts on my mind when I got here this morning,” Coach Byron Scott said, “was had anybody heard any differently about what’s going on with him?”\nKobe Bryant left the Lakers’ practice facility without speaking to reporters. He and General Manager Mitch Kupchak visited Odom at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center on Tuesday night.\n“I think throughout the day we’re all thinking about him,” Scott said, “and we’re all wishing him the best and just praying, just praying for him.”\nThat’s especially true for Bryant, who played seven years alongside Odom. They were members of the Lakers’ last two championship teams in 2009 and 2010.\n“He’s very close to Lamar,” Scott said. “Loves him like a brother. So, it’s just a rough time for Kobe dealing with that. This is probably the first time he’s had a teammate that’s gone through something like this.”\nBryant was the only Lakers player who made it to the hospital to visit Odom before the team flight left Las Vegas.\n“Kobe’s amazing,” World Peace said. “Kobe left right after the game; he went to go visit Lamar and stayed there with him, and I thank him.”\nAside from Bryant, World Peace has perhaps the closest bond with Odom of any Lakers player.\nThey played together on teams in Queens, N.Y., from the time they were 11 and were Lakers teammates from 2009-11.\nWorld Peace said his brother, Daniel Artest, is staying in a hotel across the street from Odom’s hospital.\n“He’s there representing all of us from Queens,” World Peace said.\nAsked how he was holding up in the face of his friend’s dire condition, World Peace said, “It’s really not about me right now.\n“It’s all about Lamar, his kids. That’s it.”\nOdom has two children. A third, son Jayden, died of sudden infant death syndrome in 2006.\nOdom’s ex-wife, Khloe Kardashian, has reportedly been at Odom’s side since he was first hospitalized Tuesday night.\nBrothel workers found Odom unconscious in a VIP suite on Tuesday afternoon. Authorities said Odom was found with pink and white substances coming out of his noise and mouth.\nA 911 caller told Nye County dispatchers that Odom used cocaine Saturday, the first of his three days at the legal brothel.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwaicq-b88541688z.120151015184623000gtrck7d1.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwaicq-b88541688z.120151015184623000gtrck7d1.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:25:37.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
