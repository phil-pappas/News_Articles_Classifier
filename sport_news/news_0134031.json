Brady Holt View all 20 photos Ask a group of automotive journalists about the Mazda6, and you're likely to hear mainly praise for this midsize sedan for bringing style and character to the frequently unexciting class of midsize sedans. You'll also likely hear a few lament the fact that the Toyota Camry, king of unexciting, sells at roughly seven times the Mazda's volume.\nBrady Holt This reviewer has been a little less smitten with the Mazda6 than the average journalist, but continued exposure to the car – plus recent 2016-model updates from Mazda – have helped its case. Its looks definitely stand out from the competition, and its handling is better than the norm. Both qualities were achieved without abandoning family-sedan musts of decent interior space and a smooth ride, and fuel economy is also exceptional.\nHowever, when the Mazda6 was last redesigned, as a 2014 model, it was positioned as a premium sports sedan, and it excelled neither for luxury nor for sportiness. It wasn't especially powerful, didn't have an especially high-end interior, and – to this reviewer – didn't feel especially sharp in routine driving.\nThree test drives and two weeklong tests later, the 2016 Mazda6 is at last starting to feel more like a standout. Mazda has greatly improved the design, quality, and electronics of the interior. The steering is feeling more endearing, especially at higher speeds. And decently roomy interior and outstanding fuel economy continue to impress.\nThe interior could still be fancier. The steering could still be sharper at lower speeds. An optional engine with more power would be welcome. And, barring those, a price advantage over the more established competition could work wonders; the tested fully loaded i Grand Touring model has a sticker price of $33,395 and buyers should expect to haggle less than $3,000 off that MSRP.\nBut as it stands, the upgraded 2016 Mazda6 is more compelling than ever for a buyer who wants something out of the ordinary in a midsize family sedan.\nWhy to buy it\nThe Mazda6's premium character – found in its styling, handling, interior quality, and features list – is the defining reason to consider it against the comparatively drab, sensible Camry. The Mazda feels more solid and controlled on the road, and more exciting inside the cabin.\nThe car's handling inspires confidence, and at higher speeds, the steering rewards spirited driving. Nicely bolstered seats hug the front-seat occupants, not allowing a casual slouch. The new-for-2016 infotainment system features a luxury-like control knob between the front seats, rather than the Camry's big, simple, large-point-font buttons. Leather padding abounds in Mazda's cabin, and high-end niceties – like four auto-up power windows, and an electronic parking brake – are sprinkled liberally throughout the model lineup.\nThe aforementioned gas mileage is another great selling point to the Mazda6. Most models have EPA ratings of 26 miles per gallon in the city and 38 mpg on the highway – ratings that wouldn't be bad even in an economy car. The tested fully loaded i Grand Touring model includes some fuel-saving tricks that boost that number further; with energy-recapturing brakes and aerodynamics-improving shutters in the grille, the ratings climb to 28 city / 40 highway. This reviewer observed 36.2 miles per gallon in a week of mixed driving that skewed more toward highway. This non-scientific observation is in line with the 34.5 mpg recorded while testing the mechanically unchanged 2015 model in approximately similar conditions.\nLastly, the Mazda6 is a rare midsize sedan available with a manual transmission, which you can buy on the base i Sport or mid-level i Touring. (Though most of the cars, including all of the i Grand Touring models, will be sold instead with a six-speed automatic.)\nA promised diesel engine has never materialized, with Mazda unable to match Volkswagen in meeting strict U.S. emissions regulations. (Of course -- presumably, much to Mazda's bitter last laugh -- VW wasn't able to meet the regulations either.)\nWhy to skip it\nIf you're looking for a midsize sedan because you mainly want sensible, practical transportation, you'd likely question the need to sacrifice some interior space, some rear visibility, some ride plushness, and some ergonomic simplicity. Indeed, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord each beat the Mazda6 in all or most of these ways, and while costing several thousand dollars less.\nSecondly, an interest in a premium-feeling midsize sedan doesn't leave Mazda as your only option. The Ford Fusion is another car that blends style, functionality, and agility; the Accord, too, offers fair sophistication to its cabin and driving dynamics. Again, both are less expensive. And some details of the 2016 Mazda6 remain less than perfect despite the upgrades, such as a dull, dated gauge cluster; cheap sun visors; and a clunky turn-signal stalk.\nAnd buyers interested in the sportiness of the Mazda6 might also favor the Accord or Fusion due to their quicker low-speed responses and their available larger engines; the Fusion has an available turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 240 horsepower and the Accord's available 3.5-liter V6 reaches 278 hp. The Mazda6's base engine – a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 184 horsepower – is competitive with the base Fusion or Accord, and the rest of the class, but there's nowhere to go for more zip. (Most other models, too, can be had with extra power, though they don't rival the Mazda as well for handling.) The Mazda6 engine isn't especially smooth or quiet, either.\nComparison review: Ten 2015 midsize sedans\nIf you just love it\nIf something about the Mazda6 really resonates with you personally – the way it looks, the design of its cupholder, a particular rare feature, or anything else – just be aware that it's not the only midsize sedan in the driving-enjoyment game, or an especially strong value on paper. But even if it's not as roomy as a Camry or Accord, it does still fit four adults in reasonable comfort, and it trumps both best-sellers for fuel efficiency.\nIf you just hate it\nIf something about the Mazda6 simply rubs you the wrong way but you do want a car much like this one, the Fusion or Accord are probably your best alternatives. The Fusion comes closest to the overall package of premium sports sedan, but its ergonomics are fussy and its fuel economy doesn't approach the Mazda's. The Accord, meanwhile, can come off as a plain generic car, but it's surprisingly sprightly to drive in addition to being spacious and versatile. It, too, faces some ergonomics issues following a 2016-model update. And if part of the Mazda6's appeal is to stand apart from the crowd, you can consider passing the common Ford and Honda in favor of a pleasantly competent and reasonably agile Subaru Legacy.\nOverall\nThe Mazda6 blends reasonable levels sportiness, luxury and utility. Although it's not perfect in any, if the blend is to your taste, you'll likely find it worth the price premium over its competitors.\nSee also:\nComparison review: Ten 2015 midsize sedans\nComparison review: 11 2014 compact sedans\nReview: 2015 Mazda3 s Grand Touring\nAll Cars Examiner reviews\nMore about the 2016 Mazda6:\nGallery of exterior and interior photos\nVehicle base price (MSRP): $21,495\nVersion tested: i Grand Touring\nVersion base price (MSRP): $30,195\nVehicle price as tested (MSRP): $33,395\nEstimated transaction price as tested:* $30,722\nTest vehicle provided by: Mazda North America\nLength: 191.5 inches\nWidth: 72.4 inches\nHeight: 57.1 inches\nWheelbase: 111.4 inches\nWeight: 3,250 pounds\nTrunk volume: 14.8 cubic feet\nTurning circle: 36.7 feet\nEngine: 2.5-liter I4\n- Horsepower: 184\n- Torque: 185 pound-feet\nTransmission (as tested): 6-speed automatic\nEPA city mileage: 28 miles per gallon\nEPA highway mileage: 40 miles per gallon\nEPA combined mileage: 32 miles per gallon\nObserved mileage during test: 36.2 miles per gallon\nFuel capacity: 16.4 gallons\nAssembly location: Japan\nFor more information: Mazda website\n* Estimated transaction prices are based on data from Truecar.com and dealer Quote: s.", "external_links": ["http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/displayPage.action?pageParameter=modelsMain&vehicleCode=M6G", "http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/displayHomepage.action", "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-vw-horn-congress-html-20151007-htmlstory.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:12:10.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
