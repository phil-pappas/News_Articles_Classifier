The Yankees need better starting pitching, and it starts with Masahiro Tanaka . He was pretty good this season, but the Yankees invested $175 million in Tanaka; they need better than pretty good. It's not OK that he gave up two home runs against Houston in a winner-take-all wild-card game. It's not fine that his regular-season ERA was 3.51. Tanaka is not worth the money the Yankees are paying him, but it's too late to rethink that mistake. He's still the best they have; they just need him to be better next season.
