Patrick Maks South Florida Sun-Sentinel Game of the Week: Boynton Beach, Boyd Anderson clash in 6A duel \nBOYNTON BEACH — During a recent practice at Boynton Beach, first-year coach Errik Lowe stood near midfield wearing a pair of dark sunglasses and a camouflage safari hat. With his whistle in hand, it's clear there is a new sheriff here, and this stadium is his town. \n\"You know the old cliches? The hard-work-always-pays-off stuff?\" Lowe said. \"(We're) not just saying it, but doing it.\" \nLowe, who was hired in March after a lengthy tenure at Lake Worth, wants to usher in a new era for a team that was in disrepair. \n\"I take over the program, and a lot of kids were used to missing practice, missing weight-lifting sessions, missing team functions and not necessarily having a valid excuse,\" he said. \"And in my opinion, as far as the standards that we have, there are no excuses. You're there.\" \nSo far, Lowe's approach has lifted the Tigers to a surprisingly successful season despite returning only three starters from last year's team, which finished 9-2 and advanced to the Class 6A quarterfinals.

We're in that moment,\" he said. \"We have that opportunity when a lot of people didn't think we'd be anywhere close to it.\" \nLowe and his coaching staff inherited a shell of a team; the Tigers lost 32 seniors to graduation, including former star quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is now the starter at Louisville. \nDave Brousseau ranks the county's deep well of signal-callers from this season. \n\"We knew going in it was going to be — I wouldn't say a rough season — but a challenging season,\" Lowe said. \nIndeed, Boynton Beach has had its shares of highs and lows this year. The Tigers were routed 48-6 at Dwyer in their season opener and lost 14-13 at Lake Worth two weeks later. But since, they've won three straight and find themselves in a position to keep hopes of a playoff berth afloat. \"When you're losing 32 seniors,\" Lowe said, \"no one would ever think you'd be 4-2.\" \nBoyd Anderson, though, is no pushover. The Cobras average 28 points and are led by one of the area's best quarterbacks in junior Shabazz Telfort, who is expected to return after missing the last two weeks with a knee injury. \n\"The kids understand — and we've stressed it every day this week — Boyd Anderson is going to bring their A-game. And we have to bring ours,\" Lowe said. \"Some guys are going to have to make some plays for us.\" \nIn particular, the Tigers will look to junior QB Curtis Williams to keep the Cobras off balance. \n\"This game is going to be important for him,\" Lowe said. \"He knows that and he's working this week and concentrated on what he's supposed to do.\" \nDespite playing at home, Boynton Beach — with its youthful, inexperienced roster — likely enters Friday's game as the underdog. That's how Lowe likes it. \n\"I accept the challenge,\" he said, \"and we embrace it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:07:21.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
