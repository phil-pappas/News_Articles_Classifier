Perhaps a bubble team. We're not seeing top-25 caliber here, but certainly a step up from last season. There will be plenty of time to see if that ranking is too high or too low (I think it's a bit low to be honest).\nPlaying in the ACC will certainly bring some tough opponents to Syracuse's schedule, including North Carolina, who ranks No.1 in the CBS poll.\nBut how does Syracuse's full 2015-16 schedule coincide with CBS' ranking?\nBelow are the teams on the Syracuse basketball schedule as they appear in the CBS ranking.\n1. North Carolina\n5. Virginia\n7. Duke\n16. UConn*\n17. Wisconsin\n20. Notre Dame\n21. Miami\n28. Georgetown\n30. Michigan*\n32. N.C. State\n43. Syracuse\n48. Florida State\n50. Louisville\n60.
