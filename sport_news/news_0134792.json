The visitors overhauled the 93-run target with 17 balls to spare to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Put in to bat, the hosts faltered against a disciplined South African attack to be bowled out for a paltry 92 in 17.2 overs. This was India's second lowest T20 score after 74 against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2008. The crowd, unable to digest the poor performance of the home team, started throwing water bottles on to the ground. The spectators continued to throw the bottles during the South African chase, not responding to repeated requests on the public announcement system to keep calm. For South Africa, the bowlers made the difference, with Albie Morkel (3/12), Imran Tahir (2/24) and Chris Morris (2/16) giving the Indian batsmen a tough time. After a brisk start by openers Shikhar Dhawan (11) and Rohit Sharma (22), the Indian batting lost the plot. Dhawan was the first to go after being trapped lbw by Morris, while Virat Kohli (1) and Rohit ran themselves out. Leg-spinner Tahir also swung into action by scalping Suresh Raina for 22, leaving the hosts looking down the barrel at 67/5. Morkel, who was drafted into the XI in place of Marchant de Lange, took care of skipper MS Dhoni (5) and Axar Patel (9) as Tahir and Morris kept up the good work from the other end. The Faf du Plessis-led side also lost early wickets as off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin (3/24) tried his best to defend the low total, but the visitors made it look simple in the end. After the fall of Hashim Amla (2), Faf (16) and AB de Villers (19), JP Duminy (30no) and Farhaan Behardien (11) made sure that the Proteas stayed on course. In the end, David Miller (10no) and Duminy took South Africa home. Crowd refuses to relent\nSouth Africa were 64/3 in 11 overs when, during the drinks break, the trouble started again with the spectators hurling water bottles on to the field, interrupting the proceedings for 19 minutes. Finally, the play resumed after repeated pleas from the Odisha Cricket Association over the loudspeaker as South Africa returned to complete the formality. After just two overs, players and umpires went back into the pavilion again with the visitors placed comfortably at 70 for three in 13 overs. This time the police forced the trouble-makers out from the stadium, and the play resumed after 24 minutes. Duminy and Miller took South Africa home in 17.1 overs in front of the empty galleries. â€” PTI Scoreboard\nIndia\nR Sharma run out (Miller) 22 S Dhawan lbw b Morris 11 V Kohli run out (Morris) 1 S Raina c Amla b Tahir 22 A Rayudu b Rabada 0 M Dhoni c de Villiers b Morkel 5 A Patel c du Plessis b Morkel 9 Harbhajan b Tahir 0 R Ashwin b Morris 11 B Kumar b Morkel 0 M Sharma not out 0 Extras (lb 1, w 9, nb 1) 11 Total (all out; 17.2 overs) 92 Fall of wickets: 1-28, 2-30, 3-43, 4-45, 5-67, 6-69, 7-69, 8-85, 9-85 Bowling\nK Abbott 3-0-21-0\nImran Tahir 4-0-24-2\nK Rabada 4-0-18-1\nC Morris 2.2-0-16-2\nA Morkel 4-0-12-3\nSouth Africa A de Villiers b Ashwin 19 H Amla c R Sharma b Ashwin 2 F du Plessis c M Sharma b Ashwin 14 J Duminy not out 30 F Behardien lbw b Patel 11 D Miller not out 10 Extras (lb 3, w 5) 8 Total (4 wickets; 17.1 overs) 96 Fall of wickets: 1-13, 2-38, 3-49, 4-76 Bowling\nB Kumar 2-0-13-0\nR Ashwin 4-0-24-3\nHarbhajan 4-0-20-0\nM Sharma 1-0-7-0\nS Raina 3.1-0-12-0\nA Patel 3-0-17-1\nMoM: A Morkel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:14:24.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
