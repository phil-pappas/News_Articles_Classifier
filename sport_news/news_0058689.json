Here's a guide to what to look for in this Halloween TV season:\nOCTOBER 25\n\"The Simpsons\": \"\"The Simpsons\": In \"Treehouse of Horror XXVI,\" Sideshow Bob Terwillger is in a deadly mood. Watch out, Bart. (8 p.m. Fox/12)\nOCTOBER 26\n\"Fear: Buried Alive\": A two-hour live special featuring three people who say, sure, go ahead, bury me alive, so they can \"overcome their darkest fears.\" (8 p.m. A&E)\n\"Cursed: The Bell Witch\": Way back in the early 1800s, they say a Tennessee man named John Bell got busy with the town witch, and next thing you know, the witch had a child. But tragedy followed, when, according to legend, the man killed the witch, and, despite being dead, she managed to put a curse on his family and descendants. In this new series, a descendant worries the curse may endanger his teenage son. So he enlists the help of paranormal experts galore to investigate the curse and figure out how to break the spell. (10 p.m. A&E)\nTV Gets Into The Spooky Halloween Spirit TV offers plenty of spooky choices during the Halloween season, including the Grimm season premiere, and the debut of Ash vs Evil Dead.\nOCTOBER 27\n\"Secrets of the Dead\": How did stories about vampires originate? The season premiere of this series explores the history of myths and legends about pop culture's most beloved blood-suckers. (9 p.m. PBS/10)\nOCTOBER 28\n\"Expedition Unknown -- Hunting Vampires\": What would the Halloween season be without a trip to Transylvania? Josh Gates goes in search of vampire legends. (9 p.m. Travel Channel)\nOCTOBER 29\n\"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\": Missed the first seasonal airing of the Halloween favorite? Here's another chance to watch. (8 p.m. ABC/2)\nOCTOBER 30\n\"Exorcism: Live!\": Feel free to raise an eyebrow, but Destination America wants us all to get excited about what they're calling the first-ever live television exorcism. This fun-filled event is happening at the St. Louis house where, in 1949, a 14-year-old boy underwent an exorcism. This is, Destination America says, the true-life case that inspired \"The Exorcist.\" And \"no one has ever attempt to cleanse the house of the spirits and demons that remain there, until now,\" says the press release. Members of the cast of the Destination America series, \"Ghost Asylum,\" including \"the Tennessee Wraith Chasers,\" will be on hand, along with \"psychic medium\" Chip Coffey. Not only can viewers watch from the safety of their presumably demon-free homes, they can watch live camera feeds on their computers and comment on any nasty spirits that may spot. To do that, go to DestinationAmerica.com/ExorcismLive during the two-hour special. (6 p.m. and repeating at 8 p.m. Destination America 201/776 Comcast; 168/668 Frontier; 194 Dish; 286 DirecTV; 203 Wave Broadband.)\n\"Evil Dead Movie Marathon\": To get fans warmed up for the undead action of the new series, \"Ash vs Evil Dead,\" Starz airs \"The Evil Dead\" at 8 p.m.; \"Evil Dead II\" at 9:30 p.m.; and \"Army of Darkness\" at 10:55 p.m. A sneak peek at the opening episode of \"Ash vs Evil Dead\" airs at 12:15 a.m. Bruce Campbell hosts. Groovy! (8 p.m. Starz)\n\"Grimm\": Season 5 finds Nick (David Giuntoli) up to his ears in trouble, but then what else is new? Oh, and there are more spooky villains lurking in the Portland shadows. (9 p.m. NBC/8)\nOCTOBER 31\n\"Scream Queens\" Marathon: The new Fox series about mean girls at a college sorority and the serial killer in the Red Devil mask who's murdering students gets the Halloween marathon treatment, as the first six episodes air. (6 a.m. FX)\n\"The Simpsons\" \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode marathon: All 25 of the annual Halloween episodes air in order, beginning with \"Treehouse of Horror I.\" (11:30 a.m. FXX)\n\"Ash vs Evil Dead\" : The one and only Bruce Campbell (he lives in Southern Oregon, don'cha know) returns as the swaggering Ash Williams, and he's got his work cut out for him. Those nasty Deadites are back, and Ash has to stop them from taking over the world. It's just as bloody and outrageous as \"Evil Dead\" fans have come to expect. (9 p.m. Starz)\n\"Deadwood: City of Ghosts\": This two-hour \"Ghost Adventures\" Halloween special takes the team to Deadwood, South Dakota, to such maybe-could be-supposedly haunted sites as the Bullock Hotel, and Wild Bill's Trading Post, where they try to summon the spirit of Will Bill Hickok. (9 p.m. Travel Channel)\n\"The Returned\": Season 2 of the French original â€” which lasted only one season in an Americanized version on A&E -- premieres. That means we'll see even more dead-but-somehow-back-and-walking-around people. (10 p.m. SundanceTV)\n-- Kristi Turnquist\nkturnquist@oregonian.com\n503-221-8227\n@Kristiturnquist", "external_links": ["https://www.starz.com/originals/ashvsevildead/featured", "https://twitter.com/kristiturnquist", "http://www.aetv.com/shows/cursed-the-bell-witch", "http://www.destinationamerica.com/tv-shows/exorcism-live-countdown/", "http://www.aetv.com/shows/fear-buried-alive", "http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/", "http://www.fox.com/the-simpsons/full-episodes", "http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/ghost-adventures", "http://www.fox.com/scream-queens", "http://www.nbc.com/grimm", "http://www.sundance.tv/series/the-returned", "http://abc.go.com/shows/movies-and-specials/listings/its-the-great-pumpkin-charlie-brown", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083907", "http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/expedition-unknown/episodes/hunting-vampires"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:21:44.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
