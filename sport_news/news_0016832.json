(21 Alive) - Indiana squanderd a 28 point lead with a combination of turnovers and bad defense in the second half and lost 55-52 to Rutgers on a last second field goal. \nNate Sudfeld threw for 461 yards and four touchdowns and Devine Redding ran for two scores as IU scored 28 straight points in the third quarter as the Hoosiers emerged from a 27-24 halftime deficit to take a 55-27 lead. \nBut Rutgers, aided by three IU turnovers in a five minute span, rallied to first tie the game and then win it with the no time left field goal.
