DODGERS 3, METS 1\nComing into this National League Division Series against the Dodgers, Terry Collins knew they would have to get through “those two animals,” Dodgers aces Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke.\nTuesday night, Kershaw would not let the Mets get through him.\nThe Dodgers left-hander exorcised some playoff demons as he held the Mets to one run on three hits as the Dodgers won Game 4 of the series 3-1 at Citi Field.\nNow, the other \"animal\" awaits.\nThe Mets head back to Los Angeles Wednesday morning and will have Jacob deGrom on the mound Thursday night against Greinke at Dodger Stadium for the do-or-die Game 5 of the series.\nCorey Sipkin/New York Daily News Mets rookie Steven Matz surrenders three runs on six hits in five innings. “That’s why, we’ve got a huge challenge ahead of us,” Collins said Tuesday afternoon. “We got a long way to go.”\nKershaw pitching on three days rest, was sharp and efficient. The three-time Cy Young winner, who has a career ERA of 2.43 in the regular season, went into Tuesday night with a 1-6 record and a 4.99 ERA in the playoffs.\nTuesday night he looked more like that regular-season animal: three hits, one walk, one run and eight Ks. Daniel Murphy, who had homered off Kershaw in Game 1, did it again Tuesday. His solo shot to right field, cut the Dodgers lead to 3-1.\nThe Mets had the tying run on in the eighth inning with two outs, but closer Kenley Jansen - who picked up a four-out save - got Murphy to fly out to right to end the threat.\nIn the end, Kershaw was clearly too much for the Mets’ lineup as he outpitched his counterpart, Mets rookie Steven Matz.\nCorey Sipkin/New York Daily News Just like in Game 1, Daniel Murphy hits a solo home run off Kershaw, but this time that is all the offense they could produce. Matz blew through the Dodgers’ lineup the first time until he got to Kershaw, who smacked a hanging slider for the first hit of the night and started the Dodgers’ three-run rally.\nKike Hernandez reached on a fielder's choice and Howie Kendrick singled up the middle. Adrian Gonzalez’s soft fly ball to center scored the first Dodgers run. Justin Turner's’ double to the left-field corner scored two more.\nMatz got through two more innings, but had to labor to do it. He left after five innings having thrown 85 pitches. He allowed three runs on six hits, walking two and striking out four.\nIt was an interesting decision to start the Long Island lefty over veteran Bartolo Colon or bringing back Jacob deGrom on short rest.\nMatz obviously has a high ceiling with his talent, but he had all of six major league starts under his belt. And he had not pitched in a major league game since Sept. 24.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News David Wright makes a nice catch over the stands in the eighth inning. The 24-year-old with a long injury history had come up with a back issue before his last scheduled regular-season start. It was minor tightness that ended with Matz missing his last start, instead going to Florida and pitch in an instructional league game to prove he was sound enough to be put on the playoff roster.\nIn the end the Mets decided to gamble on his talent and the gumption he showed in pitching championship clinching games two straight years in the minors. Last September, Matz took a no-hitter into the eighth of the Double-A championship game for Binghamton.\n“I thought it was well thought out, and I will tell you the approach was, you know, even though it's not the Major Leagues, even though it's not in front of 46,000 people, this kid has pitched, two seasons in a row, he pitched a championship game,” Collins said. “He has a feel to go out there and pitch - again, just because it's in front of 2,000 doesn't mean it's still not important; it is important. But this guy knows how to go out on that mound. We talked about the other day even though the days that he hasn't pitched a lot, but a couple of times he didn't have his best stuff. He's still limited damage. So right now we're saying, hey, if you can give us five or six innings and limit the damage, you gotta like where we're at.\n“And I still think he was our best guy,” Collins said. “We know if he goes out there and he commands his stuff, he's hard to hit. So that's why we picked him.”\nOn Tuesday night, Matz wasn't nearly as good as the Dodgers best guy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:24:39.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
