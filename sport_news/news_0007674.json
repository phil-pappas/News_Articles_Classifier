They’ve worked very hard in the offseason to get here,” Dalicandro said. “It’s a great feeling to be able to play a Friday night game at home. I think there’s something special about playing on a Friday night, more kids come to the game. It’s just better.”\nFans will see one of the more high-powered attacks around. Newton South (5-0) is averaging more than 33 points with quarterback Austin Burton leading the way. He has a stable of receivers led by Anthony DeNitto, Sasha Hoban and Frankie Barros, while running back Jamyre Soberanis is more than capable of keeping defenses honest.\nWestford Academy (4-0) rallied in the second half a week ago to defeat Waltham, 21-10, scoring the final 21 points. Connor Degenhardt is one of the top-ranked quarterbacks around and one of the big reasons why the Grey Ghosts have won seven straight dating back to last year. Running back Ben Cassidy and wide receiver Nick Fiorillo are the top skill position players. Linebacker Nick Diamond anchors a defense which has not allowed more than 14 points in a game.\n“I don’t think we need to play a perfect game to win,” said Westford coach Adam Gagne. “We just need to play a complete game, just have that next play mentality.”\nIn other key contests tonight, Central Catholic can clinch the MVC Large with a win at Andover , while Billerica can seal the deal in the MVC Small by prevailing at Haverhill .
