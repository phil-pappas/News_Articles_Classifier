Griffin detailed to NBC's Stephanie Gosk how she first made a connection between crumb rubber fields and cancer while visiting a former player suffering from Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She has since spoken to 63 former soccer players with cancer who played on artificial turf. The majority are goalkeepers, and 15 have died. Said Griffin, \"I've coached for 26, 27 years. My first 15 years, I never heard anything about this. All of a sudden it seems to be a stream of kids.\"\nSince NBC first spoke to Griffin in 2014, both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) have recently revised their position on the safety of crumb rubber, and no longer stand by statements that it is safe.\nMilberg LLP is a nationally recognized leader in protecting the rights of consumers, including those harmed in complex product liability and mass torts matters. Milberg partner Ariana J. Tadler is a nationally recognized leader of the plaintiffs' bar. Ms. Tadler has over 20 years of experience litigating and managing the full spectrum of complex and high profile cases on behalf of consumers and is a leading authority and pioneer in the field of electronic discovery.\nMs. Tadler's history makes her particularly interested in protecting athletes who may have been harmed by Crumb Rubber. She was a State Champion lacrosse goalie while at Manhasset High School, played collegiately at Hamilton College , and in 2008 was inducted into the Manhasset Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\nIf you feel that you or are family member are personally affected by this matter, have any information about Crumb Rubber, or if you would like to learn more about this potential matter, please contact the following attorney:\nAriana J.
