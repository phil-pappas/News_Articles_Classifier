He was 11 of 13 for 144 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter of last week's win in Tennessee and figured he would torch the Jacksonville defense at home. \nI love Gordon here, because the Browns are allowing 158.3 yards per game and 4.9 yards per carry and he showed flashes of his ability against the Bengals, while the Chargers played from behind their other two games. Andre Ellington is expected back for Arizona, but Johnson should still get 15-20 touches and is coming off a big week. \nGreen is a no-brainer against a horrid Chiefs secondary (see more below), while I may have to make a choice other than Hilton if Luck can't go. Robinson has been targeted 28 times in the first three games, and while he has just 11 receptions he is poised for a big game. \nBennett is in a putrid offense, but that offense could be getting a bit healthier this week and faces a Raiders defense that allowed five touchdowns to tight ends in the first three games. \nRandle is coming off a huge week and figures to get even more touches this week. \nThe Browns offense is just bad and the Chargers could be in line for some sacks and a defensive score. \nBENGALS FANTASY VALUE \nEach week I rate the Bengals fantasy players value on the following system: touchdown means must play; field goal means it's a good play; first down means play only if you have to play him; punt means don't play at all: \nTouchdown (must play): WR A.J. Green (He is a must-play virtually every week and as such he really paid off a week ago, plus Kansas City allowed at least one 100-yard receiver in each of the first three games). \nField Goal (good play): QB Andy Dalton (he's off to a great start with all his weapons healthy and is facing a pass defense that hasn't been very good so far); TE Tyler Eifert (after I thought last week he was becoming a must play every week he went without a catch in Baltimore, and because the Chiefs have been so poor covering wide receivers, tight ends didn't have a lot of production against them the first three games); WR Marvin Jones (he caught a touchdown pass each of the last two weeks and No. 2 wide receivers combined for 21 receptions for 392 yards and three touchdowns the first three games against the Chiefs); Defensive/Special Teams (this is a top-10 defense that could have multiple sacks and Adam Jones is always a threat in the return game). \nFirst Down (play only if you have to play him): RB Jeremy Hill (arguably one of the top 10 biggest fantasy disappointments this season if not one of the top 5, although he is a candidate to break out at any point); RB Giovani Bernard (has been outstanding in his role the first three games, but not a lot of fantasy value); K Mike Nugent (he's a candidate to be a solid producer each week because of the Bengals offense). \nPunt (don't play at all): WR Mohamed Sanu (he just doesn't get enough targets to justify it). \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
