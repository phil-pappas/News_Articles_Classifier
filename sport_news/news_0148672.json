The teams are improving and getting more competitive each year. And one league, the Mile High League, has some of the best 2A teams in the state. There are 13 teams in the 2A/1A league, most of them competing out of northern Colorado. Two Greeley teams have been in the upper half of the standings for the past few years. Dayspring Christian (6-1 Mile High, 12-1 overall) sits in second place this season behind powerhouse Resurrection Christian (7-0, 12-0), which is moving up to 3A next year. Union Colony (5-2, 11-2) is ranked fourth in the standings with five matches left in the regular season. Lyons (6-1, 11-1) is in the third spot, and Highland (5-2, 7-6) sits fifth. Dayspring coach Kristin Kurz, who’s in her seventh year at the helm, said there is good competition even in the Eagles’ district, which includes Union Colony. “The rest of us are just gonna stay right in this pool,” she said, mentioning the departure of Resurrection and Liberty Common. “It will be good volleyball. We’re giving 3A a run for their money.” Union Colony third-year coach Lyndsay Baker said every team cycles through good years and bad years. “And I think everybody right now is cycling at the top of their game, which is great for everybody,” she said. “ … It’s kind of nice to be on the upswing of the cycle instead of the downswing.” The Eagles and the Timberwolves had a big matchup last week, and Dayspring won the match 25-13, 35-33 and 25-21 to keep the edge over Union Colony in the league. Baker said Dayspring is a great, well-rounded team and gave the Eagles credit for their play Tuesday. “It’s a great rival for us and it’s always just one of those, who’s gonna show up to play?” she said. “And I think we showed up to play, and any given day, that goes a different direction.” The Eagles, who have swept all but two opponents, have a couple easy matchups in the next two weeks, but they end their season with two tough ones. They will play at Lyons on Oct. 20 and host 3A Frontier Academy on Oct. 22. Union Colony will play on the road at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Highland followed by some easier matches. The Timberwolves end the season at 1A Prairie (9-4) on Oct. 22. Kayla Cornett covers Greeley schools sports for The Tribune.
