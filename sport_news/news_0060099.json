The pueblo keeps court costs and fines, but the citation doesn’t go on a defendant’s driving record.\nCamacho, who retired as a lieutenant with the Rio Rancho Police Department, served as Jemez Pueblo police chief for about 18 months until this March.\nHe currently is presiding over one case but has been assigned no new appeals since the application for law enforcement funding came to light in a Journal news story published in August.\nHe is one of five hearing officers appointed by the Law Enforcement Academy Board to handle appeals brought by police officers or dispatchers accused of misconduct. He holds formal hearings, listens to testimony and makes recommendations to the board.\nCamacho told the board Wednesday he didn’t realize that Jemez Pueblo wouldn’t qualify for money from the state Law Enforcement Protection Fund if officers no longer filed traffic cases in state court.\n“I should have read that grant document more carefully,” said Camacho, who told the board there was no personal gain from his action. The pueblo received about $6,000 for equipment and training from the fund based on the 2015-2016 application Camacho signed.\nState Police Chief Pete Kassetas, vice chairman of the board, reminded him that the pertinent phrase on the application form was in bold type. A copy of the form obtained by the Journal shows Camacho signed and certified that “no officers of the Tribal or Pueblo police department cite non-Indians into the court of the tribe or pueblo, whether these are civil or criminal citations.”\nKassetas chided Camacho for not informing him about the pueblo’s decision to stop filing traffic cases into state court.\n“I was left to find out about that process through the media,” Kassetas said.\nPreviously, tribal police officers would file traffic cases in state court, but Camacho and pueblo leaders changed the practice in 2014. With the change, the pueblo was projected to collect up to a half million dollars annually in fines from non-Indian motorists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:43:42.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
