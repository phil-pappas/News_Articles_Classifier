(Photo: News and Tribune) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLOUISVILLE — A lawyer who said he represents Katina Powell — the woman who claimed a former employee of the University of Louisville men's basketball program paid her and her daughters to have sex with recruits — said Powell's daughters were not underage when they engaged in illegal activities. \nLarry Wilder, a criminal defense attorney in Jeffersonville (Ind.), said Powell retained him because of concerns she could face criminal charges based on allegations involving her three daughters in her book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules.'' \nIn the book, Powell wrote extensively about parties — which took place between 2010 and 2014 and involved sex — for which former Louisville staffer Andre McGee allegedly paid her thousands of dollars. Wilder said Powell cannot be prosecuted because prostitution is a misdemeanor with a one-year statute of limitations that has expired.

Indianapolis writer details Louisville basketball escort scandal \nEfforts to reach Powell and her daughters were unsuccessful. \nWilder said no official representing the government or law enforcement has contacted him or Powell about a possible investigation. \n\"Potentially the government has come to the same conclusion that we have,\" Wilder said, \"that the facts don't support this perception, or this perpetuation of this belief, that there were minors involved in illegal conduct. \n\"Based on the facts, none of those daughters were underage at the time they engaged in conduct involving Mrs. Powell, involving all of these folks who are up in a hornet's nest.\" \nWilder said he spoke to Powell and the book's co-author, Dick Cady, but declined to comment on who else he might have spoken with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:59:45.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
