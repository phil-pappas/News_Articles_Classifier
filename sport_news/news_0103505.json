Tungurahua. The eruption took place on February 1st, 2014. Only God can judge.\nA Christian leader who wrongfully predicted the end of the world this week maintained his prophecy remains true — he just mixed up the date.\nChris McCann, who leads a small group of believers called the eBible Fellowship, admitted that he was “incorrect” regarding Armageddon.\n“It should be noted that the world ‘not’ being destroyed on the 7th is in no way some sort of divine justification of the world,” McCann tweeted.\nThe organization went on to explain that the world still will be annihilated someday soon.\n“E Bible Fellowship was incorrect regarding the specific day of its end, but we were not incorrect concerning the fact that it will one day soon come to an end,” McCann posted.\nMcCann explained the difficulty in predicting the end of the world was much like a doctor determining how long a terminally ill patient has to live.\n\"The prognosis, however, hasn't changed,” McCann said.\n“He's still terminally ill. It's still certain he will die from his disease. It's just a matter of when that remains in question.”\nMcCann had previously said that there was a good amount of biblical evidence at his disposal that the world would be obliterated “with fire.”\nHe posted a four-part series of audio recordings about the apocalypse, along with an explanation of how it would take God exactly 1,600 days from May 21, 2011 to get to heaven.\nMcCann had based the theory from an earlier failed doomsday prediction by Christian radio host Harold Camping.\nmstumpf@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:41:09.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
