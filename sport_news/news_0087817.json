Gore completed touchdown passes to Devin Tyler, Ballard and Joseph Fentress . \nBallard scored twice in the game on the ground for Kirbyville with runs of 45 and two yards. \nBuna struggled to stop their opponent on defense, but were able to move the ball on the ground behind 100-yard rushing performances from Justin Kennedy and Remi Connell . Buna led at one point in the first quarter before all 27 consecutive points. \n\"We prepared well for Buna,\" Gore said. \"We knew they were going to come out here and fight until the very end. We might have put 60 on them, but they still have our respect year in and year out.\" \nTURNING POINT \nWith the Wildcats down 14-12 in the waning moments of the first quarter, senior wide receiver Darien Ballard caught a pass from Gore, shook a defender and dove into the right corner of the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown to give his team an 18-14 lead. \nBuna would lose its second fumble of the game on their next possession, setting up the third of Dennis' touchdowns for a double-digit lead they would only build upon. \n\"The linemen blocked for me all night and that's who I have to give credit to,\" Gore said. \"My wide receivers didn't let me down. I knew I could trust them and if I threw it they would catch it.\" \nMOST-SPECTACULAR PLAY \nKirbyville coach Greg Neece called a halfback pass that completely fooled the Buna defense, as Ballard found Dennis wide open for a 37-yard pass and catch with 4:46 left in the first half to give the Wildcats a commanding 32-14 lead heading into the locker room. \nThe score capped a 21-point unanswered run in the first half from Kirbyville that turned a 14-12 deficit into a comfortable 18-point halftime lead. \nBY THE NUMBERS \nThe Wildcats were all about the quick strikes in this one. Of their 10 scores, seven of them took less than two minutes off the game clock. Fumbles killed Buna's momentum during the game as the Cougars put the ball on the ground five times and lost three of them which led to 21 points for Kirbyville. \nHE SAID IT \n\"I showed a lot of people what I could do (Friday),\" Dennis said. \"We are looking towards East Chambers now.\" \nRECORDS: Kirbyville 6-1, 4-0. Buna 3-4, 3-1. \nNEXT UP: Buna plays at East Chambers. Kirbyville plays at Hardin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:56:56.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
