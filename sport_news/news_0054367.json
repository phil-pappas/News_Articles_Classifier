You understand a bit my disgust.\n\"Here (in England), when it is bad, they stress it; when it's good, they leave that in the dungeon. They have always used their little methods to annoy and alienate me.\"\nToure, who joined City from Barcelona in 2010 and has won the Premier League twice and the FA Cup once, says the media should focus more on his trophy haul rather than his pay packet.\n\"The journalists were talking about my salary and saying that it was a disgrace,\" the 32-year-old Ivorian added.\n\"They asked what I was going to change at City. And so, did you see what happened next? We won nearly everything. In fact, it is recognition that I do not have that hurts me. It is a bit sickening.\n\"It has hurt me. Everyone thinks I am happy: I have won titles, lots of money, but, no, I am not happy.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:19:44.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
