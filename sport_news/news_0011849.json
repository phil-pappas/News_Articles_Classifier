Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari offered a reality check Wednesday afternoon to those expecting the Wildcats to pick up where they left off last year.\nAdChoices \"This year's team, as we speak, we stink,\" Calipari said, via the Courier-Journal.com .\nPHOTOS: Ranking the best college basketball transfers | MORE: Dyshawn Pierre to sue Dayton over sexual assault investigation\nSpeaking before a crowd of about 800 at a Louisville hotel for the Wildcat Tipoff Luncheon, Calipari admitted it's still early, but he is concerned.\n\"I said to them two days ago: 'There's one really good thing that's happening,'\" Calipari said. \"They said, 'What's that, Coach?' I said, 'We're not playing tomorrow, so we're OK. I'm not going to panic yet.'\"\nGiven Kentucky lost seven players to the NBA draft this past offseason, everyone expected Calipari to reload the Wildcats this year. As always, he'll have an abundance of talent, including sophomore point guard Tyler Ulis, junior forward Marcus Lee and senior forward Alex Poythress. Newcomers include Skal Labissiere, a 6-11 phenom already being touted as a possible No. 1 overall pick in next year's NBA draft, and Isaiah Briscoe (rated the No. 1 point guard in the class of 2015 by ESPN). While Labissiere has not been cleared by the NCAA to play yet, he is practicing with the team.\nWhile the talent is there, Calipari wants to temper expectations, especially early, as the young team comes together.\n\"The greatest thing is we got great kids; they are gonna do what we ask them to do,\" Calipari said. \"Please understand: They are children. They are 18 and 19 years old. I'm telling you, early on, we're going to be ugly. We gotta hope that Tyler is so good that we get by being ugly.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656016-best-transfers-college-basketball-all-time-bob-bowlsby-big-12", "http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13828294/kentucky-wildcats-freshman-skal-labissiere-not-cleared-play-ncaa", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/kentucky/2015/10/07/calipari-speaking-galt-house-louisville/73449134/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-09-24/dyshawn-pierre-suspension-sexual-assault-allegation-dayton-lawyer", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:46:43.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
