Check out some of the other details from the simulation below and post your thoughts and predictions! MVP Defensive Player of the Year Anthony Davis Returning the game....losing to the Warriors 4-2 is cheese I can't get behind. #gospursgo # 2 Don Jon @ 10/26/15 02:49 PM In my career the thunder beat the cavs in 6. Man... Lebron 2-4 in finals, by the time he retires in 2k he's gonna be 2-10 lol # 3 Mauer4MVP @ 10/26/15 02:55 PM 2k is not a fan of the Bucks team. They have at best finished with the 8 seed for me. Most of my sims have them missing the playoffs. # 4 Steve_OS @ 10/26/15 02:56 PM I'm diggin' the Pistons 5 seed, but I don't personally have high expectations for them this year. Hopefully they prove me wrong. # 5 BluFu @ 10/26/15 03:04 PM Lebron in the Finals, Washington out of the playoffs, Anthony Davis winning DPOY, and KD winning MVP... Just another 2K season. # 6 Crystar500 @ 10/26/15 03:09 PM The Bulls usually make the Finals whenever I simulate the first season. # 7 Trent Booty @ 10/26/15 03:18 PM I got Cavs beating the Thunder in 6 games, KD was MVP, DeAndre Jordan was DPOY and Russell was ROY. Jamal Crawford was 6MOY, and Hoiberg as COY. Otto Porter won MIP as well. # 8 Kodii Rockets @ 10/26/15 03:27 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Steve_OS I'm diggin' the Pistons 5 seed, but I don't personally have high expectations for them this year.
