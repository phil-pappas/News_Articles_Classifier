(AP) — Darius Hammond scored on a 4-yard run midway through the fourth quarter and Charleston Southern held on to beat Presbyterian 10-7 on Saturday. \nHammond fumbled into the end zone, but a review confirmed that Hammond had possession when the ball crossed the goal line. Presbyterian got the ball on its 11 with 3:48 left, but Kaleb Griffin was intercepted after back-to-back sacks, and the Buccaneers ran out the clock. \nHammond finished with 70 yards on 12 carries for Charleston Southern (5-1, 2-0 Big South). \nGriffin was 9 of 18 for 55 yards and was intercepted on two of Presbyterian’s final three possessions. Darrell Bridges had 26 carries for 104 yards and scored on a 5-yard run in the second quarter to give Presbyterian (1-6, 0-2) a 7-3 lead. \nCharleston Southern held Presbyterian to 142 yards and nine first downs.
