He wanted us to win but this is as good as we could get – it’s still a good day,” Winterbottom said. \n“It was just cool to get on the podium. I am stuffed – I put everything in it I could. \n“We just couldn’t catch Craig. I will go to bed happy tonight.” \nWinterbottom said they were inspired by a pre-race talk with Mostert on the phone. \nAnd Mostert could be seen cheering them on from his hospital bed on a teammate’s mobile phone throughout the race. \n“He’s going good, he’s in good spirits,” Winterbottom said. \n“We Facetimed him this morning. We had a team huddle, he went around and said hello to everyone.” \nWinterbottom said Mostert would be taken by helicopter to his Melbourne home on Tuesday after the youngster had a rod inserted into his shattered left leg. \n“He is in pain, what he did was a massive shunt,” Winterbottom said. \n“But he is going home on Tuesday. He is moving into a new house.” \nWinterbottom kept his lead in the championship standings, 399 points ahead of six-time Bathurst champion Lowndes, with four rounds left. \nWinterbottom was counting his lucky stars after receiving two black flag penalties following electrical problems that disrupted his brake lights. \n“I had power out in the dash and everything, that could have been game over,” he said. \n“It could have been disastrous if I didn’t finish. \n“But I wasn’t thinking about the championship. I wanted to win the race.” \nThe next round is the Gold Coast 600 enduro starting on October 23.
