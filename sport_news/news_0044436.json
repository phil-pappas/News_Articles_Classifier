And though he’s made only one of those, Lopez is planning on attempting more this season. \nWhen asked how many, Lopez said he might get into Steph Curry territory: 600-plus three-point attempts. \nThat was a joke, which is good, because coach Lionel Hollins doesn’t exactly seem to be a champion of the idea. \nTake the coach’s response earlier this week when he was asked about the possibility of Lopez shooting more long balls. \n\"I don’t know,\" Hollins said. \"We’re not running any plays for him. If he’s out there and it happens, it happens. You guys think about stuff that I don’t even think about.\" \nLopez is a force in the paint. But one of the things that makes him so dangerous — and such an effective scorer — is that he can step out and hit a long jump shot off a pick-and-pop. \nSo since he’s already taking long jumpers fairly regularly — Lopez went 25-of-60 on 20-24 footers last season — Lopez worked this off-season on taking one step back behind the three-point line to make them count. \n\"It makes a big difference,\" Lopez said. \n\"I’ve been shooting out [there], heels right on three. Taking that extra step back makes a big difference for the opposing team’s defensive scheme.\" \nLopez said taking three-pointers is something he might have concentrated on earlier. But with his injury problems — this is the first time since the Nets moved to Brooklyn that Lopez enters a season not recovering from surgery — and constant coaching changes, it just hasn’t worked out. \nNow, he’ll finally get a chance to add that other dimension to his game. He even showed it off, draining a three-pointer in Monday’s preseason debut. But don’t expect things to change too much. \n\"I’m not trying to float around the perimeter or anything like that, the entire game,\" Lopez said. \n\"But if that’s the call, I’m confident if I get a chance I can knock it down.\" \nHollins said he won’t call that play. But he also admitted that if Lopez wants to take three-pointers, he’s not going to stop him. \n\"If he’s out there and he shoots it, what am I going to do?\" Hollins asked. \nBench him, perhaps. \n\"When I put him back in and he takes another one, what am I going to do?\" Hollins responded. \nHe makes a good point.
