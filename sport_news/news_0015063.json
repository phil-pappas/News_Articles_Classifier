He had re-injured the hamstring before by coming back too early and didn't want to risk doing that again. \nWell, McCoy has changed his tune a bit heading into the Bills' Week 6 game against the Cincinnati Bengals. He practiced on a limited basis all week and was listed as probable on the injury report. McCoy doesn't quite think he's 100 percent healthy, but that's not going to stop him from playing. \n\"Right now, just how the season has gone, we need this win,\" McCoy said Friday. \"It's a big one. A lot of guys are banged up. Maybe get a big win here, get one more. Go into the bye week and have some time to get healthy. Full week of no running and just treatments. So that's the mindset. Hurt or not, we need this win. So I'm out there for my teammates.\" \nThe Bills' backfield could use McCoy back in the mix. In his absence, Bills running backs are averaging a collective 2.48 yards per carry. McCoy thinks Cincinnati's defense in particular will find it tough to prepare for his style of running. \n\"They react well to the ball,\" McCoy said. \"Aggressive group, fast. Just gotta go out there and make plays. Seeing some clips on tape where they let the ball carriers get outside a little bit. Some space to make some different guys miss in the open field. So we'll take full advantage of that. That's something that Greg does good with.\" \nBills coach Rex Ryan said Thursday the injury wasn't the same one that McCoy dealt with in the preseason and added Friday, \"I guess sometimes the experts get it wrong.\" \nMcCoy said the Bills haven't talked about his workload, and Ryan was evasive when asked whether he would be on any sort of pitch count. \n\"Tomorrow we'll probably talk about it,\" McCoy said. \"We'll see what happens. But I'm out there. When my number's called, I'm gonna be out there. Looking to make plays.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:55:41.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
