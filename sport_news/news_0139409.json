The next big play was a 4th-and-inches at the Owls 12 and junior quarterback Jack Maltby dove ahead for the first down. \nUltimately it all came down to 4th-and-2 at the 4-yard line with 16 seconds remaining and Coffey barreled ahead for three yards to set up 1st-and-goal at the 1-yard line. \n\"Coming into this game we were out of the playoffs and seeded ninth,\" said Coffey. \"We knew it was a must-win and power points were on the line. I have so much faith in our line which kept driving and getting first down after first down and ran out the clock.\" \nCONTROLLING THE BALL \nAfter a scoreless first quarter Park Ridge took over at its own 32-yard line after a Cougars punt. Hall ripped off runs of eight and 16 yards and Matthews fired a 26-yard pass to Gabriel Robles to move the ball down to the 16. \nHall gained eight more yards, setting up 2nd-and-2 at the 8-yard line. Matthews appeared to have scored on an 8-yard run but a holding penalty negated the touchdown. \nCresskill's defense clamped down forcing Matthews into an incomplete pass and stuffing him for no gain on a keeper. The Owls attempted a field goal but the kick sailed wide left. \n\"We were able to get a couple of stops and caught a break on a couple of incomplete passes and the missed field goal,\" said Quinn. \"We knew they would be able to move the ball down the field a little bit so we had to control the ball and clock and keep the ball out of their hands.\" \nCOUGARS SCORE FIRST \nTaking over at the 20-yard line with 10:03 left in the second quarter, Park Ridge was signaled for a personal foul facemask penalty moving the ball up to the 48-yard line. Maltby completed a 13-yard pass to Daniel Garzino which brought the ball to the Owls 34. Nick Carroll added a 13-yard run while Coffey gained four yards on a 3rd-and-2 at the Park Ridge 7. \nFrom there Coffey blasted through the hole for the score. But the extra point failed so the Cougars led, 6-0 \nOwls junior running back Ray Tomatsu returned the ensuing kickoff to the 26-yard line. On a 3rd-and-11 from the Park Ridge 24, Matthews aired out a 27-yard pass to Robles. A pass interference call against the Cougars defense kept the drive alive for Park Ridge. The Owls cashed in on a 2nd-and-10 at the Cresskill 15 as Matthews hooked up with Joshua Lewis on the touchdown and Kurt Nixdorf drilled the extra point making it 7-6. \nANSWERING BACK \nThe two teams exchanged punts to start the second half, and then the Cougars wasted little time jumping ahead as Coffey busted through a hole and scampered down the left sidelines for a 76-yard touchdown.
