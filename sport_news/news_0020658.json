Andrew Luck and Adrian Peterson be warned – there’s plenty of talent making its way up through the system, with two high school players putting up insane offensive numbers, with one even shattering a national record, during a football game in North Carolina on Friday.\nDavidson Day (Davidson, N.C.) defeated Harrells Christian Academy (Harrells, N.C.), 104-80, in a matchup that had more total points than four NBA games that were played on the same day.\nDavidson Day’s Will Grier, who entered the game with nearly 4,500 passing yards, 54 touchdowns and only five interceptions, threw for a national-record 837 yards and 10 touchdowns, according to the school, while Harrells Christian senior running back Russell Washington collected 699 yards and cruised to seven touchdowns, including runs of 55 and 40 yards.\nIf Grier’s stats stand up, the junior quarterback will have crushed the previous national mark of 764 yards, which was set in 2000 by Pacific Palisades’ David Koral.\nThe story was originally reported Friday night by Lake Norman Citizen sports editor Justin Parker , who said the two teams combined for more than 1,600 yards of total offense, which is also likely to be a national record.\nAlthough the NFHS record book doesn’t record total offense between two squads in a game, Davidson Day’s 924-yard performance is second best in prep history, only behind Bay St. Louis St. Stanislaus’ 937 in 2012.", "external_links": ["http://www.lakenormancitizen.com/sports/sports-news/item/3263-davidson-day-tops-harrells-104-80.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:49:14.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
