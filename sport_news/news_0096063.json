Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Oct 10, 2015; Glendale, AZ, USA; Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby (87) and right wing Phil Kessel (81) against the Arizona Coyotes during the home opener at Gila River Arena. The Coyotes defeated the Penguins 2-1. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby, left, wasn't paired with Phil Kessel in practice on Friday. Mark J. Rebilas USA Today Pittsburgh Penguins coach Mike Johnston didn't just tweak his lines during Friday morning's practice. He pretty much made wholesale changes as the team attempts to ignite a sputtering offense that has produced just 11 goals in seven games.\nAdChoices For starters, captain Sidney Crosby (one goal, two assists) was no longer paired with offseason acquisition and five-time 30-goal scorer Phil Kessel (two goals, one assist). Instead, Crosby skated with Pascal Dupuis and Patric Hornqvist while Kessel was grouped with Evgeni Malkin (team-leading three goals, five points) and rookie Sergei Plotnikov.\nCrosby: When (changes) happen that means you’re trying shake things up. We’re not scoring enough ... Hopefully that will be the answer. -MC\n— Pens Inside Scoop (@PensInsideScoop) October 23, 2015\nJohnston completed the shuffling by putting Nick Bonino and rookie Daniel Sprong with Chris Kunitz.\nCoach on the lines: \"We have to look at what works well together. Right now we're not locked into anything.\" pic.twitter.com/AQbrB0X5qj\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) October 23, 2015\n\"We need to get more scoring chances out of certain lines. We took a look at some different combinations this morning,\" Johnston told the team's website, one day removed from Pittsburgh's 4-1 setback to the Dallas Stars . The Penguins (3-4-0) will look to get it in gear for Saturday's road tilt with the Nashville Predators (6-1-0).\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "https://twitter.com/PensInsideScoop/status/657601780017156097", "http://www.foxsports.com/southwest/story/stars-roll-to-fifth-straight-win-beating-penguins-4-1-102215", "https://twitter.com/penguins/status/657593920193482752", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://t.co/AQbrB0X5qj"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:21:46.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
