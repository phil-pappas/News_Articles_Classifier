The line quickly swelled to more than 100 people, so owner Chere Hall, 41, started tattooing a little earlier than anticipated, at 11 a.m.\nPeople flocked to the tattoo parlor on Southeast Stephens Street in Roseburg as it held a fundraiser Sunday for victims' families and those who were injured in last week's shooting at Umpqua Community College. Hall, along with tattoo artists Chris Bellville, an employee, and Robbie Mills, who came up from Medford, offered UCC-themed tattoos in exchange for donations.\n\"We were just thinking about the families and the aftermath and the things that people don't think about,\" Hall said of the fundraising idea.\n\"You know, the post traumatic stress disorder and stuff like that,\" she said.\n\"That's all I have to offer is time and tattoos,\" Hall said. \"So I wanted to do something to band everyone together.\"\nHeather Tatum, 40, of Roseburg attended the college several years ago and has been donating groceries, buying T-shirts and donating to relief funds since the shooting. But Tatum showed up at Tapestry Tattoo for something a little more permanent. Getting a \"Roseburg Strong\" tattoo was, she said, another way of giving back.\n\"There's just a lot of giving right now and paying attention to everyone and being considerate,\" said Tatum, whose daughter, Kirsten Tatum, 21, also came to get a tattoo.\n\"It makes me very proud to be part of the community,\" Tatum said of the spirit that has spread throughout this city of 22,000 in the days after the shooting.\n\"I'm proud of the community I live in. We're pulling together and giving back. \"\n-- Beth Nakamura 503-221-8218\nTwitter: @bethnakamura\nInstagram: @bethnakamura", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/bethnakamura/", "https://twitter.com/bethnakamura"], "published": "2015-10-12T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:09:30.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
