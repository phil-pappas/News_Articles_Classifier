As Julia Roberts says to Andy Garcia in “Ocean’s Eleven”: “In your hotel, there’s always someone watching.”\nAfter a summer with a renewed attention to his conditioning and with a potential contract extension at stake, Sullinger’s body is under more scrutiny than any employee this side of a Hooters waitress.\nOnce upon a time, he would recoil when his weight was brought up for discussion. Now he is more accepting, though he still doesn’t necessarily love the topic.\n“Yeah, but it is what it is,” said Sullinger, who went for 14 points and four rebounds in 15 minutes Tuesday in Milan and 7 and 6 in 11 minutes during Thursday’s completion of a 2-0 trip in Madrid. “This is always going to be a part of who I am. No matter how small I get or no matter how big I get, that’s always going to be a question and a topic of discussion. I just have to blank it out and keep playing basketball.”\nWhat’s behind that paragraph is not just a change in physique, but an entirely different mindset.\n“I have to go back to John this summer,” Sullinger said of John Lucas, the former NBA player who has become a mentor to those with issues both basketball-related and otherwise. “We had long talks, you know? I love John. He’s like my other dad, and he adopted me as his son damn near.\n“He always told me. He said, ‘You don’t really need to care about what people think about you. Just go out there and do your job.’ And I think for the past two years I’ve been so worried about what everybody says.\n“We had these long conversations, and I opened up to him. I realized that I’ve been so worried about what everybody says, and I wasn’t really worried about basketball. I think this year for the first time since my rookie year it’s all about basketball. I don’t care what anybody has to say. As long as I’m in my happy place, as long as I’m doing what I need to do and as long as I make strides to be the person I need to be for this basketball team to win, that’s the biggest thing.”\nAnd that “thing” is unquestionably defense. For all his other points of contention — the need to improve in all areas of his game, in addition to his body — the main obstacle to Sullinger having a long and successful NBA career is guarding people. He will have to do that much better to be on the floor enough to have a true impact.\n“I think that’s the biggest thing — defense,” Sullinger said. “And as I realize I’m in better shape, I’m doing more things on the defensive end than I’ve done in the past two years. I’m kind of finding my way. I was telling Walt (McCarty, assistant coach) the other day, I’ve blocked more shots in practice …”\nAt that point in the discussion, Kelly Olynyk came down the hallway and offered a drive-by comment.\n“That’s a lie,” he said.\nSullinger smiled and said, “It was your shot, as a matter of fact.\n“But I’ve been blocking more shots than I’ve ever blocked in the past two years,” he continued after Olynyk had turned the corner. “It was kind of funny. But that’s just from working every day to be the best basketball player I can be.\n“What’s improved the most is that I can make the second and third efforts on the defensive end. And when my legs are feeling tired, I’m able to find the extra juice to be able to knock down that shot.\n“When you’ve got guys like Tyler (Zeller) and Amir (Johnson) and (David Lee) and Kelly (Olynyk) — even Jordan (Mickey) — you’ve just got to play basketball. You can’t really (worry) about how many minutes you’re going to get. You’ve got to go out there and play like you’re only going to get a minute.”\nThe Celtics are well aware of Sullinger’s defensive questions, but Danny Ainge stopped short of appearing to single him out. The club’s issues are greater and more varied.\n“I think Sully can be a better defender, sure,” Ainge said. “But I think all of our bigs can be better defenders, and they’re going to have to be better defenders if we’re going to have success this year. Because we don’t have a 7-footer that just protects the rim, we need Kelly and Sully and Tyler and David and Amir and Jonas (Jerebko) to all be better defenders. That’s a big focus for our team.\n“But I wouldn’t single Sully out. Sully’s our best rebounder. I hate putting pressure on one person to get better on something when everyone on our team needs to.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:41:40.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
