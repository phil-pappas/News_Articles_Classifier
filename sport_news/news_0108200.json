(Ozarks Sports Zone) -- Back in August Glendale snapped Ozark’s 62-match unbeaten streak against local teams. In September, rival Nixa snapped the Lady Tigers’ 19-game win streak and ended their run of three consecutive COC-Large titles. And, on a Wednesday in October, Ozark righted both of those wrongs, sweeping No. 8 Glendale in the semifinals before topping No. 1 Nixa 2-1 to claim the Class 4 – District 12 championship in front of a packed house at Kickapoo High School. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS While winning the program’s seventh consecutive district championship was the ultimate goal, revenge was also on Ozark’s mind.“This group of seniors really wanted to keep the tradition going,” said Ozark senior Paige Perry. “We started slow but everything was about getting here to this game. We talked before the game about how we didn’t want the same outcome that happened during the regular season. We came out ready to fight and executed our game plan and took care of business.” But, business started slowly for the Lady Tigers. Nixa scored 12 of the first set’s 17 points and never trailed in a 25-13 win. Missouri State commit Aubrey Cheffey notched seven kills in the opening set.“We caught a couple breaks early and were able to capitalize on them,” said Nixa head coach Annie Zimmerman. “Momentum was going our direction and we were able to carry that through the first set.” Brewer didn’t say much to her team following the first set; she felt like they already knew what needed to be done. But, Ozark did make a shift defensively to try to limit Cheffey’s powerful right hand.“Obviously she’s going to get her kills, but we wanted to slow her down,” said Brewer. “We started releasing on her so she couldn’t hit between the pin and the blocker, we didn’t want to give her any panels, and hoping that our middle would close. That was our strategy and it started working.” It paid dividends immediately as Ozark turned a sluggish 5-2 start to the second set into a 13-9 lead. Back-to-back kills from Perry and senior setter, and UMKC commit, Kendra Sater gave Ozark a 19-13 lead. The Lady Tigers took the second set 25-21, led by the play of their seniors. That would continue into the third set. After exchanging the first eight points of the game, a 7-3 spurt gave Ozark an 11-7 lead that it wouldn’t give back. Nixa made several runs, each met with an Ozark answer, often times by Sater or Perry.“I’m so proud of the effort of my kids. That was all them; I challenged them and they stepped up. I think in that situation it was the experience. We had two kids on the floor that had won three district championships in a row and that was big at the end,” said Brewer. “It’s fun to coach kids with that much talent; you can coach them at a different level. They are competitors, they are athletes and they know how to come up big.” Perry finished with a team-high 13 kills. \n“Her speed makes her so tough,” said Zimmerman. “She transitions so well which allows her to take such a strong approach to the ball for every swing.” While Perry will have eternal bragging rights over her future teammate, Cheffey did finish with a game-high 16 kills. The loss marked Nixa’s first against a Missouri school all year. It was also the Lady Eagles only loss to a team that wasn’t ranked No. 1 in the state at the time. Nixa finished 2015 with a 29-3-1 record, the most wins the program’s had in a single season since a 32-win 2011 campaign. That was also the last time the Lady Eagles won the COC Large. Zimmerman loses two of the program’s best in Cheffey and setter Rielly Dobbs, both of whom finished top in Missouri history in kills and assists respectively. This will go down as one of the best teams in program history.“I love who they are as people,” said Zimmerman. “I'll miss watching them play together as a group but I'll miss being around them off the court even more.” With a seventh consecutive district championship in hand, Ozark will look to make it seven straight trips to the Class 4 Final Four, hopefully ending Lafayette’s run of four state championships in a row. Ozark’s lone state championship came in 2009. In Saturday’s sectional/quarterfinal round Ozark (31-5) will take on COC Large rival Republic at 3p.m. in Willard, with the winner advancing to meet the winner of Willard/Smith-Cotton for a berth in the 2015 Final Four.“We have an opportunity,” said Brewer. “I’ve been telling them all week that today is the big test. We respect every opponent that we’ll see on Saturday, but we have the opportunity to continue playing and we have to capitalize on that opportunity.” *NOTE: Kendra Sater also (unofficially) broke the state record for games played. Sater has played in 352 sets and the MSHSAA record as currently listed is 346 by Verona’s Winter Craft. Wednesday’s championship also marked her 157 th career match, also (unofficially) a state record, beating Lisa Hunter’s previous mark of 156. Both numbers will have to be officially submitted and verified by MSHSAA.
