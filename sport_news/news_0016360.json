A cunning crew of bank burglars pulled two daring heists involving cellphone jammers, disguises, drilled passageways into vaults and narrow escapes from the cops, documents charge.\nNedzad Korac, Jamarb Duhanxiu and Ramiz Povataj are accused of the elaborate bank jobs at a Citibank on Park Ave. South and a Santander Bank in Hoboken, N.J.\nThe trio was indicted last week and will be arraigned in Manhattan Federal Court on Friday.\nIn the first heist, on July 18, surveillance video captured three masked men enter an office in the Citibank through a hole cut in the floor at 2:30 a.m., court papers charge. They broke into the vault behind a bank of ATMs, smashing surveillance cameras with hammers.\nThe perps fled the bank undetected when police arrived at 2:45 a.m., and then returned once the boys in blue left with the mistaken belief nothing was afoot, according to documents. At 4 a.m., cops returned and noticed the ATMs were off. Officers heard a voice from behind the machines and smelled burning metal, according to court papers. By the time the cops got into the vault, the bandits were gone, leaving behind a grinder, crowbars, an ax, a mallet, cutting wheels and an extension cord, papers show. Documents don’t indicate they succeeded in getting any cash.\nDetectives said the suspects swiped a DVR machine that stored a trove of surveillance video.\nBut cops also caught a break. An attentive Citibank employee had run into four shady men claiming to be Verizon workers who were snooping around the building’s basement earlier in the week.\nThe men were so suspicious the bank worker recorded surveillance footage of them on his cellphone, papers show. That proved to be the break in the case the NYPD needed.\nJamarb Duhanxiu has also been indicted for the alleged bank heists. Cops were able to get an unnamed cooperator who cased the joint with the crew to snitch, papers indicate.\nAuthorities then spied on the crew as it held a planning session at a Starbucks at Second Ave. and 80th St. for the Santander Bank break-in, according to a criminal complaint. The men bought $2,000 in tools, as well as a police radio scanner using a stolen credit card, according to papers.\nCops say they recorded Povataj discussing a cellphone jammer he referred to as “the motor” that disrupted bank alarms. On Sept. 7, the crew allegedly attempted the burglary, cutting through the floor of a Hoboken yoga studio leading into the Santander bank vault.\nThat’s when cops closed in.\nPovataj, 40, was busted wearing two earpieces and speaking into a small microphone on his wrist, prosecutors said. Duhanxiu, 40, and Korac, 43, were also arrested. At Korac’s apartment, police found a face mask and a list of numbers that correspond to frequencies used by all NYPD precincts, documents show.\nKorac and Povataj have lengthy criminal histories. All three were in custody and being held without bail.\nWith Ryan Sit\nsbrown@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Cops investigate after 'bank robber' shot by customer Couple who posed with cash on Facebook accused of bank heist FBI agents dig up $500G buried in ard after truck heist", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:44:36.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
