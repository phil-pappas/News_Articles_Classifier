Griffin is a wide receiver and cornerback for the Colonels. \nQuestion: What is the most important lesson you have learned from playing on the BUHS football team? \nGriffin's answer: Teamwork! Football is not an individual sport; it is the ultimate team sport. Everyone has a job to do that forms a system that works perfectly. Trust your teammates to do their assignment and trust yourself to do yours and if that goes well you will have a perfect play every time. \nQuestion: What is the best part of being on the BUHS football team? \nGriffin's answer: I feel like out of any program at the high school this one has the most commitment to the team. I have never played a sport that feels like being on the BUHS football team before; it is a feeling of friendship and connection — like being part of a family. We have pasta parties every week during the season and work out together off-season. We are like a family — we all feel the same about each other whether we have just come off an incredible win or a terrible loss. \nQuestion: How do you encourage a teammate to be the best they can be on and off the field? \nGriffin's answer: You have to encourage someone positively to be their best. Everyone is a brother on the team and you don't want to shut anyone down, everyone is important. I accept their mistakes and encourage them to move on and keep trying.
