Kane County sheriff's spokesman Patrick Gengler said a Kaneville area resident reported seeing two suspicious people near a park in the village about 5:30 a.m. Tuesday. Deputies searched the area but couldn't find anyone. Two men, one with dreadlocks, are reported to be at large after a crash involving a passenger vehicle and a semi about 12:10 a.m. Tuesday along I-88 near Dauberman Road in Kaneville Township, Gengler said in a news release. Illinois State Police Master Sgt. Jason Bradley said the vehicle involved in the crash was stolen shortly before midnight Monday in Chicago. State police took one suspect into custody at the scene of the crash on I-88, but two others fled on foot and were not found, authorities said. No further descriptions are available of the two men reported to be at large after the carjacking and crash. The suspect in custody suffered nonlife-threatening injuries in the crash and was taken to Presence Mercy Medical Center in Aurora, Bradley said. Kane County sheriff's deputies have increased patrols in the Kaneville area and notified school officials with Kaneland Unit District 302. Anyone who sees a suspicious person matching the description is asked to call 911.
