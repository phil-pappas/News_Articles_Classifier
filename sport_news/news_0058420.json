It was the only loss of the season for Maryville, which finished 17-1-2.\n\"It's a little sweeter because it's a bit of payback for what they did last year,\" Maryville coach Bill Stooksbury said. \"I know they're hurting. We hurt last year. It's just very ironic how it was flipped this year.\"\nMaryville will play at Hardin Valley Academy on Thursday for the district championship and home-field advantage in the Region 2-AAA semifinals.\nBearden (15-3-2) had 10 shots on goal to two for visiting Maryville, which put heavy defensive pressure on Lady Bulldogs forwards Casey Riemer and Taylor Frizen.\n\"They had a good game plan,\" Bearden coach Ryan Radcliffe said. \"It's hard to score against six defenders back there, and their keeper made some big saves.\n\"They obviously know about Casey and Taylor and what kind of threat they are, and each of them had three (defenders) on 'em. It's hard to break down that wall.\"\nMaryville scored in the 11th minute. Carolyn Hobbs took a shot that was blocked by diving keeper Abby Mink, and Preston Robinette scored on the rebound shot.\n\"Carolyn had a great shot and it bounced off their keeper,\" Robinette said. \"I was just there to put it in.\"\nHendrix and the Maryville defense made the goal hold up.\nBearden had six shots on goal in the first half and four in the second half.\nWith 3 minutes left, Bearden's Emily Carlevato drilled a shot from about 30 yards and Hendrix punched it over the crossbar.\n\"I thought she had me,\" Hendrix said of Carlevato's shot. \"I'm just really happy I got to it. It was a good shot.\"\nDave Link is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:33:32.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
