But SMU, with its own dual-threat quarterback in Matt Davis, scored the next 20 points before Boykin's 42-yard scoring strike to Josh Doctson with 6:32 left.\nBoykin, who finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting last year, completed 21 of 30 passes. His only interception did help the late surge by SMU (1-2), but the senior quarterback made another big throw to Doctson to make sure the Frogs avoided being upset in the Battle for the Iron Skillet.\nDoctson had five catches for 171 yards and two touchdowns. Aaron Green ran 21 times for 164 yards with two scores, including a 1-yarder in the final minute.\nClick here to visit the SMU page.\nNichols: SMU throws scare into No. 3 TCU, but Frogs QB Boykin's six TDs too much for Mustangs\nExperience playing Baylor, TCU for SMU freshmen will 'will pay big, big dividends' as season progresses\nSMU-TCU quick hits: Frogs strike quickly in first half; Mustangs test TCU secondary\nPhotos: Trevone Boykin leads TCU as Frogs claim Iron Skillet with 56-37 win over SMU\nSMU's Courtland Sutton makes best catch of the year... that doesn't count\nTCU quotable: Gary Patterson not happy with defense; 'You watched it, they had 500 yards'\nFive Thoughts: SMU shows no quit under Chad Morris, nearly shocks rival TCU\nClick here to visit the TCU page.\nFive thoughts from No. 3 TCU's 56-37 win over SMU: Horned Frogs escape upset bid to capture Iron Skillet\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcu-horned-frogs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/smu-tcu-quick-hits-frogs-strike-quickly-first-half-mustangs-test-tcu-secondary", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/smu-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/20/tcu-quotable-gary-patterson-happy-defense-watched-500-yards", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-smu-shows-quit-chad-morris-nearly-shocks-rival-tcu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/nichols-smu-throws-scare-3-tcu-frogs-qb-boykins-six-tds-much-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-3-tcus-56-37-win-smu-horned-frogs-escape-upset-bid-capture-iron-skillet", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/09/19/photos-trevone-boykin-leads-tcu-battle-iron-skillet-smu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/solid-outings-baylor-tcu-means-experience-smu-freshmen-will-will-pay-big-big-dividends-season-progresses", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/smus-courtland-sutton-makes-best-catch-year-count"], "published": "2015-09-18T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:44:00.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
