We feel sure he will continue to progress in the same manner. \n\"We weren't sure in the summer whether we could keep Asmir Begovic, and I think if Asmir had stayed, we probably would have looked to get Jack out on loan for another 12 months to help his development. \n\"But, as it was, when it became clear Asmir was leaving, I had no qualms whatsoever about making Jack my number one because he is that good.\" \nHughes was speaking ahead of Monday night's Premier League away clash with Swansea. \nStriker Mame Diouf will not be involved having been granted compassionate leave following the death of his mother, but defender Marc Wilson (calf) is fit to make his comeback and winger Xherdan Shaqiri (thigh) should also be available.
