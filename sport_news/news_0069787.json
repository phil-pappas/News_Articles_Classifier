Many countries devaluated their currencies, putting more pressure on Chinese exports, one of the three pillars of China's economic growth,\" Sheng told a media briefing.\nChina's exports growth dropped 7.9 per cent year on year in the first three quarters to 17.87 trillion yuan, according to the NBS.\nDuring the first nine months, industrial output grew 6.2 per cent year on year and fixed-asset investment climbed 10.3 per cent. Property investment grew 2.6 per cent year on year, while retail sales of consumer goods rose 10.5 per cent.\nAs the exports continued to fall, Chinese economy is undergoing transition from an export dependent economy to the one based more on domestic consumption which is causing a painful transformation.\nObservers say while the 6.9 per cent GDP was regarded as slightly above expectations, the continued slowdown was expected to put pressure on the government data and is expected to raise pressure on policymakers to step up monetary policy to halt the slowdown. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:17:28.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
