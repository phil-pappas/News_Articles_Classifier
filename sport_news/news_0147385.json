They should vote for a can­didate based on his or her ability and experience to work in the best interest of our citizens and keep Nash­ua strong,\" said Deane, a mayoral candidate who fin­ished third in a six-way spe­cial municipal election last month. \nDonchess took top billing in the Sept. 8 primary with 4,213 - or nearly 40 percent - of the total of the total 10,538 cast. He will face off in the Nov. 3 general elec­tion against Chris Williams, the former Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce president and CEO. Wil­liams, making his first bid for elected office, came in second with 2,682 - or 25.4 percent - of the vote. \nOne of the most popular and long-serving elected officials, Deane's endorse­ment was highly-sought after. He is serving his fourth term as alderman at-large and previously was a public works com­missioner. \nIn all five of his prior citywide races, Deane was the top vote-getter before he placed third in the may­oral primary with 1,978 - or 18.7 percent - of the vote. \nThe Donchess campaign could assert more than 58 percent of the vote if Deane's supporters cast their ballots for him. \n\"He stands for fiscal discipline and account­ability, for common sense in approaching the chal­lenges facing the city, and for quality city services,\" Donchess said of Deane. \"David's endorsement demonstrates that I am the best choice for mayor.\" \nWilliams, who has gar­nered a ground-swelling of support among young professionals and the business community, said Deane's endorsement was not a surprise due to the fact that Deane had shared on social media he intend­ed to support Donchess in the election. \n\"What is surprising is the fact that the city's best known protector of the budget would endorse the one person who had raised taxes more than any other mayor in the last 40 years,\" Williams said. \"David Deane's supporters in the primary counted on him to protect the city's tax rate and its spending pri­orities, so it's interesting that David Deane would abandon his conservative fiscal values in favor of his longtime friendship with Jim Donchess.\" \nAlderman-at-Large Dan Moriarty, who placed fourth in the primary with 1,384 - 13.1 percent - of the vote, said Donchess and Williams \"reached out\" to him seeking his endorse­ment. \n\"I put a lot of thought into it and I'm going to stay neutral,\" Moriarty said, noting he had lunch with both candidates. \n\"I wanted to at least give them the respect they de­served by meeting with them,\" Moriarty said. \"I'm just going to watch from the sidelines.\" \nDonchess cited Deane's long service to the city, and called Deane \"a per­son of character.\" \n\"David listens to his constituents. He is well liked and respected by citizens all across Nashua. He is one of the most con­sistently hardworking and conscientious members of the Board of Aldermen,\" Donchess added.
