Smith"], "text": "Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 8:39 AM Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 8:39 AM Fall sports offer a wide variety of competition for sports fans. The Kansas City Royals have created quite a ride for the past two falls. Chiefs fans are hopeful this will be the year that the team regains the glory of the golden years of the franchise. Pro soccer has become huge locally with a fan base that has grown by leaps and bounds. With local college teams of Missouri, Kansas State and Kansas, as well as very strong small college area teams added to the mix, there is no shortage of games to attend. We even offer outstanding barbecue competition in the fall with the American Royal cook-off. There is so much going on that high school football can get lost in the shuffle. In the past five years I have noticed a definite drop-off in attendance at local high schools. For the past 10 years the best high school football teams in the state of Missouri have been on the west side of the state and yet the decline in attendance has been slow but steady. Even in traditional big rivalries, the crowds have not been up to par. Football has really been challenged in popularity at the lower levels like Pop Warner, junior high schools and now even at the high school level. Participation at the Pop Warner level has been down about 2.5 percent for the third year in a row. Junior high teams are averaging about 20-30 players less than previous years. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the big class schools were averaging 175-200 players in grades 9-12. Now those big schools are averaging only 100-200. Football is an extremely popular professional sport, but that trend may not continue long with the lack of participation in lower levels. Fear of injury is the main reason cited for lack of participation by youth. It is a legitimate concern at any and all levels. Nearly every high school currently has an athletic trainer and staff members who are also trained to correctly handle athletic injuries. Current coaches are aware of heat-related illnesses and concussions. Coaches today are much more aware of and properly trained in symptoms related to over exhaustion and concussions than they once were. In most cases, all high school staff members will take all precautions with any football injury. The safety of the athlete is front and center in every program. Preseason training has advanced. High school players now train for six months prior to the beginning of the season in mid-August. The use of high-tech equipment has also protected athletes from sustaining serious injuries. Even with that, sales of football equipment by local sporting goods distributors have been down over the past five years. The risk just looms too big for many young people. When asked by someone recently if I would want my grandsons to play football, I had to think long and hard before I answered. High school football has been my life and my love, but it is crucial to understand proper safety on every play. Page 2 of 2 - The game of football is the best team sport there is. It takes 11 players working together to achieve a common goal. It is a sport that provides the learning of many life lessons. Teamwork, self-sacrifice, hard work, commitment and character are all taught. It is definitely not for everyone, but if it is to survive as the most popular sport in America, it will need to be willing to make changes. No sport will ever be worth a lifelong injury. A step has been made in the right direction to take safety precautions and to realize that the players are the most important facet of the game, but that trend needs to continually evolve and grow. • At the risk of sounding like a guru, I do believe that Andy Reid is an excellent football coach, but it may be time for him to hand over the offensive play calling to his offensive coordinator. It might help the team’s time management problems that occur and the end of the half and the end of the game. • As much as Mizzou coach Gary Pinkel does not like quarterback controversies, one may have developed this year. It may be able to work itself out, but the Missouri fans are not going to let it go away any time soon. It is the first words out of their mouths. • My quote of the week comes from American clergyman Roy L. Smith: “The man who cannot believe in himself cannot believe in anything else. The basis of all integrity and character is whatever faith we have in our own integrity.” Tim Crone, a William Chrisman High School graduate, is a former activities director and coach for Blue Springs High School and is a host of a weekly radio show, “Off the Wall with Tim Crone,” on KCWJ (1030 AM) 6 p.m. every Monday.
