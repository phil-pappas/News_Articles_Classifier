He'll go through one check and then take off running,\" Kaufusi said. \"You see his eyes going back and forth and that's what we want. It was nice to be able to see that and cause that antsiness.\"\nKaufusi was a catalyst for Moore's antsiness, if not the main one.\nSure, the senior defensive lineman registered three sacks and three tackles-for-loss on the night, but it was so much more than that. Time and again Kaufusi would beat his blocker, force Moore from the pocket, hurry a throw and completely disrupt the Bearcats passing game.\nOh yeah, he also had a blocked field goal.\nThe result? Only 62 yards passing by Cincinnati for the final three quarters while the Cougars registered eight team sacks, their most since the 1997 Cotton Bowl when BYU defeated Kansas State 19-15.\n\"They just played really hard,\" said BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall of his team's ability to forge an effective pass rush. \"We made a few personnel changes, a few little tweaks with schemes here and there, but really it was just effort.\"\nAccording to Mendenhall, the pass rush changed the course of the game, as much as any other factor. \"It allowed a team that was (averaging) close to 600 yards and 40 points — that was what really changed the game,\" Mendenhall said.\nAs far as Kaufusi's individual play, Mendenhall, much like everyone else, came away impressed.\n\"He's having a fantastic season,\" Mendenhall said. \"He tries really hard and he's the catalyst in terms of leadership on the team just because he's a solid individual. But man, he tries so hard and I think he is a great representative and possibly the identity of the team.\"\nAs far as Kaufusi was concerned, his effort was helped big-time by his coaches and teammates, particularly nose tackle Travis Tuiloma , who recently returned to the lineup after suffering a knee injury.\n\"Coaches just put me in good situations where I'd have one-on-ones, twisting things and it was nice to have Travis (Tuiloma) in the middle where he could get a big push,\" Kaufusi said. \"I'm just happy that I was able to help out the team.\"\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com \nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:33:13.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
