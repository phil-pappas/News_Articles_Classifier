Paul Ryan spoke those admirable words recently. While considering whether to run for House speaker, the father of three school-age children made clear he would only take the job if his demand for work-life balance was met.\n\"I cannot and will not give up my family time.\"\nGood. I wish more working people felt that way.\nMore importantly, I wish more working people had the luxury of making that demand. And therein lies the problem with Ryan's seemingly inspiring statement.\nThe onetime vice presidential candidate considers family time a priority for himself. But he and the Republican Party he represents have shown little interest in the familial needs of workers.\nRyan has voted against legislation to give federal employees paid parental leave. He and his party have blocked legislation that would mandate paid maternity leave and paid sick leave for all workers. When President Barack Obama brought up the issues in his State of the Union speech in January, saying paid leave is \"not a nice-to-have — it's a must-have,\" Republicans wouldn't even applaud.\nThe budget Ryan presented in 2014 would do away with the Social Services Block Grant, cutting $16 billion in federal funding that, among other things, provides child care subsidies for low-income families.\nIn 2012, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops criticized Ryan's budget plan because it didn't meet certain \"moral criteria,\" mainly citing cuts to services for the poor. That same year, a Catholic nun, Sister Simone Campbell, called Ryan's budget \"immoral.\"\nThis all raises legitimate doubts about how far Ryan's work-life balance concerns stretch beyond his own personal sphere.\nEllen Bravo, executive director of Family Values @ Work, a family leave advocacy group, said in a statement: \"It's terrific to see a male elected official talking about the importance of spending time with his children. All Americans would like to have this time — especially when a new baby or ill family member needs care. But very few Americans have the resources Ryan does to demand that their jobs allow for family time. Instead of taking steps to ensure that every person can manage the demands of work and family, Rep. Ryan has repeatedly opposed progress on that front.\"\nI take nothing away from Ryan's obviously sincere desire to not let his political work in Washington, D.C., keep him away from his wife and kids in Janesville, Wis. We know all too well now that people work best when they can strike a balance between family and career. He deserves that as much as anyone.\nIn theory, by drawing a line in the sand over this issue, Ryan made an important statement. A man in a position of power speaking openly and insistently about the value of work-life balance is unusual, and could open the door to a change in the way workers and their managers view the issue.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, according to a report in The Hill, said of Ryan's family demands: \"That's very exciting because that's what we want for all of America's families. Members of Congress have paid sick leave — it means a lot to the family-work balance. I hope that that respect for his particular situation would translate for a recognition of what that means to all of America's families.\"\nAnd there's the rub. Ryan has the potential to get what he wants — the opportunity to spend time with his family — while also helping others achieve the same goal.\nBut that's going to require a change of heart. That's going to require a recognition that someone who isn't a powerful politician, someone who is just trying to make ends meet, has as much right to family time as anyone else and that we, as a society, benefit from giving people that time.\nWe remain the only industrialized nation without paid maternity leave. Our leave policies in general make it borderline impossible for low-income workers to take time off to care for sick kids. We talk a lot about the importance of family but do little to keep work from trampling family time.\nI would love to say that Ryan's refusal to sacrifice precious hours with his children to obtain one of the highest political offices in the land is a moment that will change our working world for the better.\nI would love to see him go on and use his power to make sure other Americans are blessed with the same opportunity to bring work and family into alignment.\nBut I have my doubts about him. And I fear that, in the end, he'll be just another man with power getting what he wants while the needs of others go unmet.\nDo me a favor, Rep. Ryan.
