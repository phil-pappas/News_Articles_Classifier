Presently the group represents 192 abused and neglected children in Bastrop, Fayette and Lee counties, but only 59 percent of them have a volunteer on their case, CASA said.\nNow, the nonprofit is asking for more volunteers to get involved.\nCASA volunteers help children navigate the court system safely, quickly and effectively. COURTESY PHOTO The group is hosting a new volunteer advocate training information meeting on Oct. 19 at 6 p.m. at the CASA office located at 507 Water Street in Bastrop. The meeting will include a casual discussion on the workings of the group and is aimed at helping interested persons figure out if becoming a CASA volunteer is a good fit.\nCASA volunteers are appointed by judges and are tasked with gathering information on their clients through thorough review of documents and records, as well as from interviews with the children, family members and professionals in the children’s lives. After collecting data, volunteers are then charged with providing written reports at court hearings, appearing in court and providing testimony when necessary, helping the child understand the court proceedings, seeking cooperative solutions among individuals and organization involved in the children’s lives, ensuring children are receiving appropriate services and reporting concerns about the child to corresponding professionals, monitoring case plans and court orders, and keeping the court informed on any new developments, officials said.\nAnyone interested in attending the informational meeting can RSVP by email at executivedirector@casabastrop.com or by calling Kristi Glasper at 512-303-2272.\nWhat do CASAs do?\nCASA volunteers get to know the child and speak to everyone involved in the child’s life, including their family members, teachers, doctors, lawyers, social workers, and others.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/09/e3/64/wide-feature-3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:59:50.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
