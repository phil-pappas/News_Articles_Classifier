That ugly night in Clemson lore, when West Virginia’s 70-33 final margin of victory became a punchline, was the last game Clemson played without Brent Venables prowling the sideline as defensive coordinator. “We’ve come so far. When I came here, I wanted to be part of a great defense,” Lawson said. Each of the next two years, 2012 and 2013, Clemson won 11 games thanks to the No. 9-ranked offense in the country and, often, in spite of but not instead of an improving defense that’d still give up 30-plus points in victory. Then in 2014, Clemson’s defense was elite, leading the nation in a boatload of defensive categories thanks to three defensive linemen and two linebackers now on NFL 53-man rosters. That team squeezed 10 wins out of a quarterback quandary and overall shaky offense. 2015? Say hello to a stratosphere of potential in Clemson, S.C., and it’s not in spite of the defense. It’s because of No. 12 Clemson’s defenders, who once again in Saturday night’s 24-22 win over No. 6 Notre Dame guarded the goal line with their lives. “We have that mentality we’re going to play every down like it’s our last,” junior Ben Boulware said. “It came down to defense, and kudos to our guys. No one let the environment or atmosphere get to them.” Even when it got ugly in the fourth quarter – after being dominated on both lines of scrimmage for three quarters, the Fighting Irish outgained Clemson 225-64 in the fourth period – the Tigers saved enough juice for a game-winning stop. “I told them, just play the next play. Just fricking play this play,” head coach Dabo Swinney exclaimed in his postgame interview with ABC. “Don’t worry about screw-ups. Win this play, win this down. I’m just happy they never quit.” Before Death Valley grew tense during Notre Dame’s steady comeback, Clemson’s defense was the star of the show. The Fighting Irish averaged 3.8 yards a play in the first half, and never mounted a running game throughout the entire game, averaging 3.5 yards a carry. Speaking of 3.5, that’s how many tackles for a loss Lawson had – in the first quarter, against projected first-round pick and Irish left tackle Ronnie Stanley. Mouthy cornerback Mackensie Alexander backed up his talk, locking up Irish star receiver Will Fuller for two catches and 37 yards. Notre Dame also committed four turnovers, including a forced fumble by Boulware and interception by B.J. Goodson – linebackers who replaced two starters now on NFL teams, Stephone Anthony and Tony Steward. “We’ve got to stand tall. Here, we’re big on character,” Goodson said. “Me and my guys, we came through.” Wrap a mind around this statistic: in 2010 alone, when the Tigers went 6-7 overall, Clemson was leashed by a 1-5 record in games decided by a touchdown or less. Since the opener of 2011, Clemson holds an 11-1 record in games decided by a touchdown or less. Read that again: 11-1 by a TD or less. Eleven wins, and only one loss, which was the litany of errors costing the Tigers dearly last Sept. 20 at Florida State, which happened to be the defending national champion and No. 1-ranked team in the country. But there’s another thing. Look at all the close calls Clemson’s endured since that night in Tallahassee, and they’re all conveniently in the last 365 days. Oct. 11. Louisville, trailing by six, hits a 73-yard pass to get the ball to the Clemson 8-yard-line with 1:08 to go. Clemson’s defense stones the Cardinals, survives 23-17 . Sept. 17. Louisville, seeking revenge, can’t obtain it when the Cards take two drives inside the Tigers’ 40-yard-line and come up with no points in Clemson’s 20-17 triumph . Saturday. Notre Dame has a chance to erase a 21-3 deficit pull even with a two-point conversion, only for quarterback DeShone Kizer to get stuffed by Tigers defensive tackle Carlos Watkins and safety Jayron Kearse . “All those two-a-days in the summer,” Lawson said, “we do goal-line practice, and we take pride in that, not letting them get in the end zone.” Four heart-pounding finishes. Four late stands by the defense, and zero slip-ups. It isn’t always pretty, which means Venables, who seems like he chews nails for breakfast, might not have the stomach for it. “If we were in better control of the game, I’d love it,” Venables said. “But I didn’t feel in great control of the game. So no, I didn’t like it today. I loved it last week (at Louisville) when they were fumbling all over the place and they throw a Hail Mary there, and we’re all standing at the goal line waiting. I like that one better than the 2-yard-line.” Venables, the $1.35 million man, has all the respect of his pupils. “Ever since he’s come here, he’s instilled the values, the skills, the techniques, all the ins and outs of being a great defense,” Boulware said. Swinney has become a bit of a broken record in the past 13 months, squawking from podium after podium how wonderful it is to win on defense. Not that long ago, such luxuries seemed a fairy tale, lowlighted by an awful 60 minutes in Miami. “I knew that was a bad night,” Swinney said. “But my message after that was, I know it’s been 31 years since Clemson’s been to the Orange Bowl. It ain’t gonna be 31 years before we’re going to be back, and when we get back, it’s going to be a different result.” Funny thing about that Orange Bowl redemption story: it was won when Anthony, who famously declared Clemson’s defensive renaissance as a recruit, picked off Braxton Miller with 1:18 to go in Clemson’s 40-35 win over future national champion Ohio State, yet another clutch stand for a defense that just won’t be knocked over.
