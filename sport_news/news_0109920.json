More and more, insurers are raising prices around the edges — in the drugs the plans choose to cover, in copays and out-of-pocket maximums, even with separate pricing across county lines.\nSEE: Downloadable PDF of managed care plans in the Portland area\nIt makes an already difficult evaluation process that much harder to navigate.\n\"It's much more complicated to compare services you may not know you need,\" said Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation , a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit health policy research organization. \"Few people in October anticipate having a broken hip in April and all the services they might need to get through recovery.\"\nOn top of that, unless Congress acts, nearly a third of Medicare recipients face a 52 percent hike next year in the monthly premiums the government collects for basic Medicare insurance. The other 70 percent face no premium hike at all. We'll get to the reasons for that in a moment.\nAround Portland and Salem, more doctors' offices and specialists are now refusing to take new Medicare patients unless they have a Medicare Advantage plan, an Oregonian/OregonLive survey has found. That's not the case in rural areas, where fewer Medicare Advantage options exist.\nThe Medicare landscape continues to change, so it's a good idea to re-evaluate your existing plan to make sure it still suits your health needs. And don't be afraid to get help sorting through the options.\nHere's what Medicare recipients can expect in 2016:\nPremium increase for the few. Everyone on Medicare pays a monthly Part B premium, which was $104.90 in 2015 for most. The premium hasn't changed in three years. But in 2016, about 30 percent of seniors on Medicare will pay at least $159.30 a month to offset the cost of those who will see no change in premium.\nThe reason? Seniors who have their premiums deducted from their Social Security checks are protected by law from having that premium increased any more than their cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits. In 2016, Social Security recipients aren't expected to receive a cost-of-living adjustment because inflation has been low. So Medicare premiums won't increase, either.\nSeveral groups of Medicare recipients aren't protected by this law. They include certain public employee pensioners who don't qualify for Social Security, seniors who've delayed taking Social Security benefits until after age 65 and individuals for whom Medicaid pays their premiums. Wealthy seniors who already pay higher premiums (singles with at least $89,000 of annual income and couples making twice that) also face these hikes.\nCurrent law requires premiums to be raised on these groups to offset the cost of holding everyone else's premium steady.\nFlat health and drug plan premiums. The average weighted premium paid by Medicare Advantage enrollees is expected to drop slightly, from $32.91 this year to $32.60 in 2016. More than half of Advantage plan enrollees will face no increase, federal officials predict.\nStand-alone Part D prescription drug plans will also hold steady. In Oregon, the average plan premium will decline from $56.99 to $53, according to Oregonian/OregonLive estimates.\nPlans are marketed by premium because it's an easy number for shoppers to grasp and compare. Unfortunately, it's not all about premiums anymore.\nIt's about all the other costs and benefits. In Oregon and elsewhere, costs for accessing health care continue to increase.\nIn some cases, providers are controlling costs by limiting preferred provider networks. Providence Health & Services will reduce the number of providers in its $0-premium Prime + Rx plan from nearly 9,000 to 4,500 in 2016. Since the plan can only be purchased in Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties, Providence dropped providers outside the service area, Providence spokeswoman Olivia Ramos said.\nDeductibles, the amount you must pay for care or prescriptions before your plan kicks in, also have risen. In 2012, only five of 16 Medicare Advantage providers offered at least one plan with a separate deductible for prescription drugs in Oregon. Next year, 13 will. And the maximum Part D drug-plan deductible is increasing from $320 to $360 this year.\nOut-of-pocket maximums, the annual limit on what you'll shell out (besides premiums) for medical and hospital care, are also increasing. In 2014, only four plans imposed a $6,700 limit. Most averaged about $3,300, The Oregonian/OregonLive found. This year, eight plans are at $6,700, and the average is around $4,100.\nOut-of-pocket maximums for Regence BlueCross BlueShield's Classic and Enhanced PPO plans, for example, will just about double in 2016. The drug deductible on its Classic plan will jump from $210 to $360.\nGeographic differences: Regence offers two versions of its $0-deductible HMO plan. The metro version covers Multnomah and Washington counties. The non-metro version is available to Clackamas, Marion, Polk and Clark (Washington) county residents and carries higher maximum out-of-pocket limits and copays for doctor's visits.\nRegence pulls out of four counties: On top of its price increases, Regence will stop offering Medicare Advantage plans in Hood, Clatsop, Tillamook and Lincoln counties, affecting more than 3,000 enrollees.\nFollowing its large premium increases in rural counties last year, Regence appears to be taking the most drastic steps of all Oregon Medicare Advantage providers to control costs, and it will shed enrollees as it does.\n\"Unfortunately, rising costs have made Medicare Advantage plans financially unsustainable in some areas,\" said Jared Ishkanian, a spokesman for Regence's parent company, Cambia Health Solutions Inc.\nResidents in those counties still have Medicare Advantage plans to choose from, but they can also return to basic Medicare and purchase a Medicare supplement (Medigap) policy without worrying about being denied for a pre-existing health issue. Such a move might also reduce costs.\n\"They have guaranteed issue into Medigap,\" said Janet Bowman, coordinator for Multnomah County's Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance ( SHIBA ) program. \"So it's a gift for a lot of people.\"\nHealth Net Inc. drops alternative care: The company's $0-premium Violet Option 2 offered alternative care, including routine chiropractic, naturopathic and acupuncture visits. That's not part of the plan in 2016, according to its summary of benefits.\nCheck drug formularies and pharmacy networks: Plans change formularies every year, meaning your drug might move from one coverage \"tier\" to another one with higher co-pays.\n\"The majority of plans have multiple tiers, and sometimes drugs shift from one tier to the other, which can have a significant impact on costs,\" Kaiser's Neuman said.\nIncreasingly, Part D drug plans are using preferred pharmacy networks to control costs, she said. Enrollees get discounts for using an in-network pharmacy but face higher costs if they fill prescriptions elsewhere.\nThe best way to determine how your drugs are covered and whether your plan has preferred pharmacies is to call your plan's toll-free customer service number. You can also enter your prescriptions into Medicare.gov's Plan Finder to see how various plans cover your drugs. An Oregon SHIBA volunteer can help. And check with your primary doctor to make sure he or she still accepts your insurance.\n•\nBrent Hunsberger is an investment adviser representative and certified financial planner in Portland.
