Join the Conversation Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 2:59 p.m. CDT October 19, 2015 Auburn LB Tre' Williams talks Kentucky win and physical matchup with Arkansas. Matthew Stevens \nAUBURN — Tre’ Williams knows what he’s likely in for this Saturday afternoon in Fayetteville, Arkansas. \nThe Auburn linebacker is already starting to mentally prepare for the most physical game of the year when they line up against the Arkansas power run game. \n“With Arkansas, you’re going to come out of this game pretty sore,” Williams said Sunday. “You have to get your mind right from day one.” \nWilliams, a sophomore, suffered an injury in Auburn’s 17-9 loss to Mississippi State where he was seen with a wrap around his left knee and was inactive for the game on Oct. 3 against San Jose State. Williams returned from the leg injury on Thursday at Kentucky and finished with four tackles. \n“I did it all throughout high school and I know I can do it again,” Williams said about playing with nagging injuries. “I was nervous. I wasn’t feeling to well at first, but my teammates kept me up and gave me the confidence.” \nWilliams talked Sunday after the confidence boost that Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn gave the defensive players but deciding to punt on the late fourth-and-one call and putting the final result on the Tigers defense. \n\"It’s always a great feeling,\" Williams said. \"Coach Malzahn told us a lot about trust — trusting within each other. The action he made by punting the ball to them, it really showed that he really trusts us and we did our job.\" \nArkansas is sixth in the Southeastern Conference in rushing at 177.33 yards per game on the ground and Auburn second to last in the league at stopping the run at allowing an average of 197.67 yards per game. The Razorbacks had three straight 200-yard outings before struggling to just 44 yards on 25 carries against Alabama two weeks ago.

(Photo: Albert Cesare/Advertiser) \nWilliams, who has 23 tackles and two quarterback hurries this season, said Sunday he expects to play at Arkansas this weekend and has been marking this game on the schedule since preseason camp in August. \n“We knew what we were getting into ever since the beginning of the season,” Williams said. “You know as a linebacker, you have to enjoy contact. Every play’s going to be contact.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RSBuul Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:49:31.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
