The ultimate sanction if any wrongdoing is found would see Rabbatts removed from the FA board, though any such move would have to be confirmed by her fellow directors. \nRabbatts, the head of the FA's inclusion advisory board, has ruffled feathers in the organisation on a number of occasions. \nIn relation to the Carneiro case, she expressed \"major concerns\" about the FA's disciplinary process which saw Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho cleared of making discriminatory comments towards the doctor. Rabbatts' comments came after it emerged Carneiro had not been interviewed by the FA as part of the process. \nThe involvement of the FA councillors is also a reflection of the on-going attempts by FA chairman Greg Dyke to modernise the governing body, and the determination of some 'blazers' to hold on to their power and privileges. \nDyke had himself told the FA council in a letter that he had supported previous strong statements by Rabbatts on the Carneiro case, and that he believed Mourinho committed \"a failure of his personal judgement and public behaviour\". \nRabbatts told Press Association Sport earlier in October: \"The FA's reaction to the treatment of Dr Eva Carneiro has been seriously disappointing. I have major concerns over the way in which the disciplinary process has been conducted and the lack of an organisational response to the wider issues raised by this case.\" \nUnder FA statutes, the investigation has to be conducted by the FA's company secretary, Richard McDermott, who will present his findings to a panel of a minimum of three people selected from the FA board.
