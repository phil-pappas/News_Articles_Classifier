(Photo: WLTX) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE After accepting the interim head coaching position for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks, Shawn Elliott said his goal is to win, and \"we're going to come out swinging.\" WFMY \nColumbia, SC-- Saying he doesn't want to get in the way of the program's chances for success, Steve Spurrier, who led the South Carolina Gamecocks to its best run in the 123-year history of the program, has announced his resignation after 10 1/2 seasons with the school. \nSpurrier confirmed his decison at his regularly scheduled Tuesday afternoon press conference held at Williams-Brice Stadium. But this was far from a regular event, with reporters from across the state and the country waiting to hear his explanation for his sudden departure. \nTaking blame for the team's recent struggles, he said a change was needed. \n\"Somehow or another we've slid, and it's my fault, I'm responsible I'm the head coach, and it's time for me to get out of the way and let somebody else have a go at it.\" \nSpurrier said he woke up Sunday morning and knew he was going to end his tenure. USC Athletics Director Ray Tanner spoke with him Sunday afternoon and asked him to reconsider. USC President Harris Pastides wondered if Spurrier would be willing to stay on for the rest of the season. \n\"I find that that doesn't work a lot, because if the players know you're not going to be their coach after such and such a time, you just don't have the accountability,\" he said. \nThe Gamecocks are currently 2-4 on the season, their worst start since 1999, when they lost all of their games. Last week, playing on the road because of the historic flooding in Columbia, they lost 45-24 to LSU in Baton Rouge. \n\"I think I was the best coach for this job 11 years ago, but I'm not today,\" Spurrier said. \"That's the cycle of coaching. Sometimes you run your course, and it's time to pass it to the next guy.\" \nThe next guy will be Shawn Elliott, who's been on the staff for six seasons, most recently serving as co-offensive coordinator. The Camden native has mostly worked with the running backs and the offensive line during his time at Carolina. \n\"I believe Shawn will bring some energy, some passion, that our team will accept,\" Spurrier said. \nSpurrier's decision to walk off onto the golf course ends one of most successful--and memorable--college football careers of all time. \nAn east Tennessee native, Spurrier chose to play college ball hundreds of miles away at Florida. As a member of the Gators, Spurrier was a two-time first-team all-American, winning the 1966 Heisman Trophy before embarking on a 10-year NFL career that included stops in San Francisco and Tampa. \nWhen he left pro football, he transitioned into coaching, working for an assistant for a few years before becoming a head coach for the first time with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the USFL. He stayed there for three seasons before that league went under. \nHe next traveled for Duke, where he led the Blue Devils to two ACC titles. That got him the job at his alma mater, and Spurrier returned to Gainesville with the task of making them a winner. \nWhat he did at that program became the stuff of legend. He took a team that had never won 10 games in the regular season to a team that consistently won 10 or more. Using his \"fun n' gun\" offense, Spurrier began to rack up points against his opponents--and titles for his trophy case. He won six SEC championships (well, seven really. His Gators weren't eligible for the 1990 title because of NCAA sanctions imposed during the previous coaching administration, even though they had the best record that year.) His crowing achievement from the era was winning the 1996 National Championship in which he defeated arch-rivals Bobby Bowden and the Florida State Seminoles in the title game. That same year, he became the first Heisman Trophy winner to coach a Heisman Trophy winner: quarterback Danny Wuerffel. \nHe also became a favorite for sportswriters, a man who always had a great quote and a jab on the ready. He once referred to then Georgia coach Ray Goff as \"Ray Goof.\" He called Florida State \"Free Shoes University\" because of a scandal involving improper player benefits. And in referring to Tennessee's bowl chances one year, he once said \"you can't spell Citrus without U-T.\" \nAfter the 2001 season, he left for the NFL, coaching the Washington Redskins for two seasons, posting two losing seasons. He didn't coach at all in 2004. \nBut in November of 2004, then USC Athletics Director Mike McGee came calling, asking him to replace Lou Holtz, who was retiring. At his opening news conference, when asked if he could turn around the Gamecocks fortunes, Spurrier said \"why not us, why not now,\" \nSteve Spurrier with players (Photo: Getty Images) \nUnder his 10 1/2 season tenure, the Gamecocks experienced an unprecedented level of success, including a three-year stretch of 11 win seasons from 2011 to 2013, which included two victories in the Capital One Bowl. \nIn the program's entire history, which began in 1892, the team had won 10 or more games just once before, back in 1984. \nThe team also had a five-year win streak against Clemson, the longest such streak for the Gamecocks in the history of those team's storied rivalry. \nHis stated goal over the years had been to lead the team to its first SEC Championship, and he came close to that accomplishment in 2010, when the team advance to the championship game where it lost to Auburn. \nThe team won five bowl games while he was in Columbia. Prior to his arrival, the Gamecocks had just three bowl wins all-time. \nSpurrier is credited with changing the culture at the university, reeling in the nation's number one running back (Marcus Lattimore) and top overall player (Jadeveon Clowney) during a three year period. He is the team's all-time winningest coach with 86 wins. \nLattimore tweeted on Monday night, \"thank you coach! Your impact will live forever in this state. Your legacy will never be forgotten. I promise you that.\" \nHe also led a push to improve the school's athletics infrastructure, which he said was needed to make the team more competitive. The school built an academic learning center, made improvements to Williams-Brice Stadium, upgraded the parking area, built new player housing, and created a new practice facility. \nSteve Spurrier (Photo: USA TODAY) \nLast year, however, things began to turn in the other direction. The Gamecocks opened with a blowout loss to Texas A&M and limped to a 7-6 record. Over the summer, Spurrier was defiant when a sportswriter in Atlanta suggested he was getting old (Spurrier is 70) and that the end was near. \"We finally won enough that they're trying to convince us that my age has something to do with it, and I can't coach anymore,\" he said. \"I can still call the plays, I can still run the show, and I plan on coaching a long time.\" \nOne of his favorite players he ever coached, Wuerffel, said on Twitter Monday, \"Thanks @SC_HBC Spurrier for all you've done for college football..and for me. Your impact on me changed the trajectory of my life.\" \nHe finishes with a 228-89-2 overall record. South Carolina football fans expressed shock over the news of Steve Spurrier's plans to retire immediately, in the middle of the season. Some said it's bad timing as they're experiencing a statewide crisis, and preparing to celebrate homecoming.
