(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) The Associated Press PHILADELPHIA â€” \nNew York Mets slugger Yoenis Cespedes was bruised on two fingers of his left hand after being hit by a pitch Wednesday night against the Phillies. \nX-rays were negative after Cespedes left the game, which later turned testy. \nThe NL East champion Mets said Cespedes was bruised on the middle and ring fingers. He was hit by an 89 mph fastball from Justin De Fratus in the third inning. \nCespedes dropped the bat, shook his hand and fell to the dirt in the batter's box. Mets manager Terry Collins and a trainer rushed from the dugout, and the outfielder exited. \nAcquired at the July 31 trade deadline from Detroit, Cespedes is batting .287 with 17 homers and 44 RBIs in 54 games with the Mets. Overall, he has set career highs this season with 35 home runs and 105 RBIs. \nMany of the large contingent of Mets fans in attendance booed De Fratus. Plate umpire Bob Davidson ruled Cespedes wasn't hit by the pitch, but the call was overturned after the Mets challenged. \nCespedes' replacement, Kirk Nieuwenhuis, was plunked in the fifth inning by Adam Loewen. In the bottom half, Logan Verrett hit Philadelphia's Odubel Herrera in the back, prompting Davidson to warn both benches. \nBoth benches started to empty one inning later when Hansel Robles' head-high fastball sent the Phillies' Cameron Rupp to the ground. Rupp got up and jawed at Robles, who walked toward the batter's box and stopped about 20 feet away. \nRupp was held back by catcher Travis d'Arnaud, and Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy quickly ushered Robles to the visitor's dugout. \nBoth Robles and Collins were ejected.
