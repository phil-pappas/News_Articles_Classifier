What all we have learned from this still-small sample?\nNothing concrete. But perhaps we can confirm some of our suspicions about the direction the sport is headed. Remember that there will never be a way to win in the playoffs. Many of baseball’s best-performing teams over long samples have lost quickly and unceremoniously over short samples in the postseason.\nBut it increasingly seems like one way to win in the modern playoffs – or to ensure a better chance, at least – is to construct a contact-hitting roster.\nHow else to explain the Kansas City Royals’ continued success? Sure, they pitch reasonably well and have a good bullpen, but what they actually do best is put the ball in play. They had the lowest strikeout rate in the major leagues this season, and Grantland research published this week showed that contact-oriented hitters typically have more success than power-oriented hitters against power pitchers. Not a lot more success, but enough to make it noteworthy.\nAnd, as we all know, power pitchers are more prevalent than ever. Especially in the postseason, and especially in this postseason, with teams using their hard throwers for a higher percentage of innings.\nHere’s what else we’ve learned, or we think we might have learned, from these 30 games.\n• The public is not going to stop being fooled by individual postseason runs, but baseball’s front offices seem poised to. Daniel Murphy has hit more home runs this month as he did in all of 2012, and his level of notoriety is of course skyrocketing. Still, MLB executive projections have him fetching something like four years and $40 million as a free agent this offseason. That is not far off from what he would have received if his season had ended on Oct. 4. (Murphy also was hitting well to finish the regular season. Interestingly enough, the last time a Mets hitter closed out a year on a hot streak like Murphy’s, it was Justin Turner. He had a 1.028 OPS in his final 36 plate appearances in New York, and then was non-tendered two months later.)\n• Yes, pitchers are throwing harder and harder, but there remains room for soft-tossing location experts, even against some of the game’s best hitters. It’s not like Royals right-hander Chris Young has dominated the competition, but the man is 36, tops out in the mid-80s with his fastball, and has thrown 82/3 innings against Toronto and Houston and given up three runs. Only one team offered him a major-league contract last winter. I wonder how many will this time – at least a few. I wonder that same thing in regards to Mets pitcher Bartolo Colon, who received a somewhat surprising two-year deal two years ago and actually made good on it. He’s 42. For how long can he keep this going?\n• Prospects need not spend years developing in the minors before they are ready to make big-league impacts. Consider that two of last year’s first-round draftees, the Cubs’ Kyle Schwarber and the Mets’ Michael Conforto, started games in the NLCS, 16 months after their professional careers began. Consider that another 2014 first-rounder, Royal-turned-Red Brandon Finnegan, successfully pitched in last year’s playoffs. And consider that a 2013 first-rounder, Kris Bryant, is the Cubs’ best position player. Baseball’s draft has a reputation for being boring, in part because fans don’t see the immediate payoffs from selections like in football or basketball. It might never gain that immediacy, but these sorts of continued contributions should be immediate enough to add interest. I expect baseball to market the young postseason performers for future drafts.\n• And, of course, we’ve learned that MLB is unafraid to buck convention, and the way things have been done in its efforts to improve game safety. The league's decision to suspend Chase Utley after his injury-inducing slide in Game 2 of the Dodgers’ NLDS loss was surprising. Less surprising was the way it went unenforced. In retrospect, that seemed part of the plan: MLB issued the punishment, knowing it would be appealed, to establish a precedent to bargain from.\nContact the writer: pmoura@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:11:25.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
