He’s one of us — an eight year-old card-carrying member of BBN, a die-hard fan and a lover of all things UK. He’s our friend. Luke also lives with the Cystic Fibrosis — but with our help, maybe Luke and others like him can find a way to beat the life-shortening genetic disease. \nThis Saturday, Luke’s family and other families touched by Cystic Fibrosis are spearheading and hosting CRAFT Louisville , an age 21+ party featuring craft beer, bourbon, wine, pizza and music at the 2nd Street Bridge Streetscape in Louisville from 7-10 pm. Regional breweries, the city’s top craft pizza makers and Louisville’s best local bands will be on hand and proceeds benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as a search for a cure continues. \nThere’s no UK game this Saturday so there’s no excuse not to help make this event a success, gang. Plus, you’ll be within shouting distance of the YUM! Center if you feel so inclined to hurl some creative jokes toward the house Pitino built. Luke himself has procured many of the items for the event’s live auction, including a signed Randall Cobb football. He also sent Cal a personal invitation to the event (I posted it below, and it’s awesome). More info on the event, the lineup, the vendors and the tickets can be found at the CRAFT Louisville website . Let’s help Luke and kids everywhere like him this weekend. It’s a whole bunch of your favorite things in one place, it’s a great cause and it sounds like an awful lot of fun. Article written by C.M.

I will be there to support! BBN is a family! BlueRedneck October 6, 2015 at 7:16 am | Permalink | Reply \nThis is a great cause – I lost a cousin to this disease. C.M., you should mention that part of the ticket price is tax deductible, since this is a charitable event. Tomlin rocks October 6, 2015 at 7:20 am | Permalink \nCorrect, $45 is tax deductible!

I’ll be there in spirit and I hope we all get one step closer to finding a cure for Luke and others afflicted by this disease. Hope Cal can make it but something tells me he’ll be apart of if one way or another. Keep on fighting Luke and Go Cats!! Luke'smom October 9, 2015 at 11:40 pm | Permalink \nThank you so much for that comment, Bluebros (it put a smile on Luke’s face), and all of the other posts above. Luke does keep fighting his battle…as he had his canned goods ready to bring to the KSR show this morning but had a turn in his disease and had to be admitted to Kosair. We will keep up the fight to find a cure and know that tomorrow will be a huge success! Thanks, BBN! Cure CF! Rachel H October 10, 2015 at 12:27 am | Permalink | Reply \nWe love Luke and his family – wonderful people and huge BBN fans. I’m so sorry Luke is in Kosair; we are all thinking of him. This is all the more reason for us to support the efforts to find a cure for CF. The time Luke’s family has put into making CRAFT into this huge event have been inspirational in how ground roots movements can make a difference.
