(AP) - A community college coach is facing an assault charge. \nWTOK-TV reports (http://bit.ly/1W89yZr ) a student and soccer player at Meridian Community College has accused coach Alex George in an affidavit. \n“Those affidavits alleging simple assault by threat with one and actual physical simple assault on two others,” Lauderdale County Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun said. \nCalhoun said the student claims George verbally threatened him, punched him the head and grabbed him by his throat and cursed at him. A warrant was issued Oct 16. \nGeorge surrendered to authorities, was booked and has since bonded out of jail, Calhoun said. \nThis isn’t the first time George has faced an assault charge. In 2010, he was accused of assault for an altercation at the State Games. The disposition of that case was not immediately known. \nGeorge’s attorney, Bill Ready Jr., said Thursday he believes the student who filed the complaint has made false claims against his client. He said the student’s motivation appears to be vindictive toward the coach. \nGeorge has served as soccer coach at MCC since 2002. He’s won three regional championships during that time. He also serves at the girls’ soccer coach at West Lauderdale High School. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:07:07.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
