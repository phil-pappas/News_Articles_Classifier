Namely, bumping last season’s victory against Michigan into the runner-up position. \n“I definitely think that’s the best win so far,” James said during the week of practice leading up to the 8 p.m. kickoff. “This one this weekend would be the best. It’s going to top that. It’s going to be the best of my career going into the rest of the season.” \nThe setup certainly looked similar. \nLike when it faced Michigan last year , Rutgers hosts Michigan State in a primetime game on Big Ten Network, pre-promoted as a chance to “Blackout The Birthplace” of college football. Carroo 'blessed' to be back with Rutgers, points to character \nRutgers is wearing all-black uniforms and helmets – a three-game winning streak in that combination is on the line – and fans were asked to wear black. \n“The last blackout we had was Michigan and the crowd was into it,” left tackle Keith Lumpkin said. “It was a great environment to play in. Hopefully we can carry that same momentum and have the stadium rocking for this game.” \nThe biggest difference, however, is that Michigan limped into Piscataway in the middle of one of the most forgettable seasons in the history of college football’s all-time winningest program. \nMichigan State (5-0) arrived playing below expectations for a senior-laden national-title contender but still positioned to earn a spot in the College Football Playoff. \n“Blackout under the lights: There is no better situation no matter who you play,” quarterback Chris Laviano said. “You can’t not get juiced up for that game. That’s kind of our advantage.” Rutgers has chance to spoil Michigan State's playoff or bust \nIt’s the second of at least three primetime games this season for Rutgers, which played under the lights at Penn State and will do so again at home Oct. 24 against No. 1 Ohio State. \nThe gameday routine – breakfast as a team, a walk-through and individual time to prepare before heading to the stadium – stays the same but is more spread out. \n“You wake up and it’s like, ‘An 8 o’clock kickoff. That’s going to take a while,’” linebacker Quentin Gause said. “But anticipating the primetime football atmosphere gets you going. When you are a kid watching on TV, you are like, ‘Wow, I want to do that.’ Well, I’m doing it.” \nGause wasn’t the only one thinking like that as a youngster. \n“That’s what every football player dreams of,” said cornerback Isiah Wharton, who will experience it at home for the first time. “We’re practicing real hard to make sure we’re ready for it.” \nRutgers drew more than 53,000 fans against Penn State and Michigan in primetime last season and is expecting a to-date season-high crowd against Michigan State, though it’s unlikely to meet last season’s standards. The student section will be at or near its capacity of 10,000. \n“The crowd always makes a difference, definitely,” Gause said. “I remember last year when it was sold-out for the Penn State game they had trouble hiking the ball because the crowd was so loud. I know our fans are awesome when they do that.” Rutgers football vs. Michigan State scouting report \nAfter dealing with a string of controversies, Rutgers fans got a lift during the week with the earlier-than-expected return of Leonte Carroo from an indefinite suspension. It only adds to the suspense. \n“It’s definitely the best atmosphere that’s in the stadium all year, especially with a good team coming in,” right tackle J.J. Denan said. “People are going to want to be there.” \nRutgers has lost eight straight against ranked opponents but actually is on a two-game winning streak against Top 5 opponents, with home wins against No. 3 Louisville in 2006 and No. 2 South Florida in 2007. \n“Anytime you play a ranked opponent it’s an opportunity,” James said, “but within the top 5 is a great opportunity. I feel like the crowd is going to be crazy and they are going to drive us, and we’re going to come out energized and we’re going to get the win.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RA4EhJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:28:24.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
