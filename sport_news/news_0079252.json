Hillsdale jumped out to a 21-0 lead in the opening quarter and never looked back, as the Tigers fell to the visiting Hornets 35-0 in the Lenawee County Athletic Association season finale for both teams Friday night. Senior quarterback Martin Petersen ran for three touchdowns and threw for another to lead Hillsdale (6-3, 5-2 LCAA), which utilized its superior size and strength to physically dominate Hudson throughout much of the contest. The Hornets scored on each of their first four possessions, while also finding the end zone during Hudson’s opening possession by way of a blocked punt recovery. Only a pair of the Tigers’ offensive possessions on the evening ended in Hillsdale territory, and Hudson never ran a play inside the Hornets’ 25-yard line. “I knew it would be tough, but I didn’t quite expect it to be that tough,” Tigers coach Chris Luma said of matching up with Hillsdale. “They really got after us early, kind of shell-shocked our kids to where we were in the hole on every possession. “They were just a better football team in every aspect.” Hudson managed just 89 yards of total offense, as the stout Hornets defense forced the Tigers to struggle for every yard. A strong kicking game from Hillsdale’s Joe Phillipp, who registered five touchbacks and a pair of punts inside the Hudson 10-yard line, constantly saddled the Tigers offense with poor starting field position. While the Hornets’ victory earned them a playoff-clinching sixth win on the season, Hudson finds itself in an unfamiliar position at the close of the regular season, that of being on the outside looking in when it comes to the playoff picture. Hudson’s 4-5 record (3-4 LCAA) will keep them out of the playoffs for the first time since 2012, and for just the third time since the Michigan High School Athletic Association expanded the state playoff field prior to the 1999 season. “Very disappointing,” Luma said of not reaching the playoffs. “I really thought this was a 6-3, maybe 7-2 team coming into the season. “It’s a little unusual not to be talking to the kids about getting ready for playoffs, so it’s frustrating.” Hillsdale opened the scoring less than 90 seconds into the contest when senior D.J. Jones scooped up a blocked punt at the Tigers’ 2-yard line and returned it for a touchdown. After forcing a second Hudson punt, the Hornets got back on the scoreboard with the first of Petersen’s three touchdowns on the night, a 2-yard run with 6:56 left in the opening quarter. Page 2 of 2 - A little over six minutes later, Hillsdale finished off the scoring in the first with a 9-yard touchdown pass from Petersen to junior tight end Jake Lemerand. The Tigers attempted to get back in the contest by launching their longest drive of the night, an 11-play, 56 yard drive, but an interception from the Hornets’ Tommy Lawhorn on fourth down, his first of two on the evening, ended Hudson’s deepest excursion into Hillsdale territory. The Hornets’ then responded with a grueling 18-play, 92-yard touchdown drive on their ensuing possession that chewed up almost seven minutes of game time and seemed to end any chance the Tigers had of competing in the contest. Already ahead 28-0, Hillsdale opened the second half with another methodical 10-play, 53-yard scoring drive that necessitated a running clock throughout the rest of the contest. Senior Matt Osborne, playing in his final game for Hudson, picked up 46 yards on the ground to lead the Tigers offense. The end of the game marked the final high school football appearance of 15 Hudson seniors, including key contributor Mason Lopinski and injured standout running back Kyle Johnson. “They’re going to be really hard to replace,” Luma said of his seniors. “It is what it is, and this will be their last game.” By Jeff Baumgardner The Daily Telegram - Adrian, MI By Jeff Baumgardner", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:36:54.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
