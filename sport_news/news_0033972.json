(AP) - A New Hampshire woman charged with beating her 3-year-old daughter to death tells police the girl appeared to have a seizure before the two of them tumbled down the stairs.\nThe Telegraph of Nashua reports ( http://bit.ly/1Ri047E ) 26-year-old Katlyn Marin told police that the day Brielle Gage died, she tried to descend the stairs, but fell and struck her head on the floor. Court documents filed by defense attorneys indicate that Marin tried to revive the girl, but she was unresponsive.\nThe documents are part of a motion filed by Marin's attorneys to suppress evidence they claim was illegally seized by investigators.\nProsecutors say Marin assaulted Brielle several times during Thanksgiving week, and she died shortly after being rushed to a hospital Nov. 25. An autopsy determined she died of blunt-force injuries.\nInformation from: The Telegraph, http://www.nashuatelegraph.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1Ri047E"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:48:56.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
