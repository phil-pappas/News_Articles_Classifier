Openside flanker Sean O'Brien could also be missing after being cited for swinging his forearm into France lock Pascal Pape's stomach during Sunday's game.\nO'Connell had previously said he'd be retiring from international rugby after the World Cup, and finishes his international career with 108 caps for Ireland _ third on the country's all-time list _ three Six Nations titles and a series win with the British and Irish Lions in 2013.\nAfter spending all his club career with Munster, he signed for French giant Toulon for what could be his last season in rugby but that may be truncated because of surgery.\n\"His time out of the game will depend on the outcome of the surgery,\" the Ireland team said in a statement.\nThe injuries to O'Mahony and Sexton also came in the brutal match against the French, which Ireland won to top Pool D and avoid a quarterfinal against defending champion New Zealand. Center Jared Payne was ruled out of the tournament on Saturday because of a foot injury, potentially leaving the Irish without five first-choice players against Argentina.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:41:53.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
