(Andy Lyons/Getty Images) \nAs it was just a preseason game Tuesday, the Milwaukee Bucks gave fans in another part of their state a chance to see the team, hosting the Minnesota Timberwolves at Madison’s Kohl Center, home of the Wisconsin Badgers. That arena, of course, also hosted thousands of Badgers fans, who let a pair of Timberwolves know that they haven’t forgotten how last spring’s Final Four played out. \nThe Badgers made it all the way to the championship game in April, only to fall to Duke, a team starring a quartet of precocious freshmen. One of those first-year players was Tyus Jones, a point guard who led the Blue Devils with 23 points, none more cruel to Wisconsin fans than a pair of three-point daggers he landed in the final minutes of the his team’s 68-63 win . \nFast-forward six months, and Jones was a rookie with the Timberwolves on Tuesday night — a rookie who got booed mercilessly by the Wisconsin faithful.

Unlike Jones, however, Towns was unable to lead his team past Wisconsin, which ended Kentucky’s 38-0 dream season in the national semifinals. \nDid Badgers fans remind him of that? You betcha. The pro-Badger crowd is chanting 38-1 at Towns when he steps to the FT line #Twolves \n— Timberwolves PR (@Twolves_PR) October 21, 2015 Fans here yelling \"38-1\" at Karl-Anthony Towns. Well, that's not very nice. \n— Kyle Ratke (@Kyle_Ratke) October 21, 2015 \nThe fans at Kohl Center also had plenty of reason to cheer Tuesday, as the Bucks notched a 106-88 win over the Timberwolves. Jones and Towns combined for 10 points on 3-of-9 shooting. Des writes for the Early Lead and the D.C. Sports Bog, scouring the Web to bring readers items of interest, both serious and amusing.
