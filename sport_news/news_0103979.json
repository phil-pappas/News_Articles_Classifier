(AP Photo/Chuck Burton) slideshow \nATHENS, Ga. (AP) â€” Senior guards Charles Mann and Kenny Gaines are proud of Georgia's accomplishments over the last two seasons. \nThe Bulldogs won 41 games, earned an NCAA tournament bid and finished tied for second and third in the Southeastern Conference. \nFor Mann and Gaines to help Georgia go farther this season, the team's top priority is staying healthy. Last season was taxing as injuries sidelined starters a combined 21 games after the first week of January. \nMann had to play multiple positions while Gaines suffered through several setbacks and needed surgery to repair a broken foot in the offseason. \nCoach Mark Fox says Gaines and junior guard Juwan Parker, who's recovering from Achilles surgery, have been monitored closely in practice this month. \n___ \nOnline: \nAP College Basketball site: http://collegebasketball.ap.org Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
