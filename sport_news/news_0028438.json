Patels never commit suicide,\" Hardik had allegedly told the youth Vipul Desai, who had announced that he would commit suicide in support of the agitation.\nHardik visited Desai's house accompanied by a team of a news channel, which had aired the conversation later.\nThis complaint against Hardik comes after almost 15 days of his controversial remarks.\nThe quota spearhead has been hogging the limelight since the August 25 \"mega-rally\" of Patels in Ahmedabad and the subsequent violence across Gujarat.\nHardik was detained yesterday in Rajkot ahead of India- South Africa third ODI, as he had threatened to protest during the match for quota for his community. He is still under detention of the Rajkot Police. —PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:17:27.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
