Two years of watching your team finish in last place in the National Hockey League. Two years when you didn't have jack. \nBut now you do have Jack. \nJack Eichel, the wunderkind 18-year-old from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, by way of Boston University and a Hobey Baker Award, the No. 2 overall pick in last June's draft, made his Sabres' debut Thursday night. \nOn the anticipation meter, only Gil Perreault's hello in 1970 (the franchise's first season) and Pierre Turgeon's in 1987 were the equal in Sabres' lore. That's because each was a No. 1 overall selection, and Eichel would have been had he not put on a pair of ice skates at the same time a kid named Connor McDavid did. One Buffalo Day Like this topic?

It actually took him a little more than 20 shifts to record his first goal, a beautiful top-shelf wrist shot on the power play that left enough time for the goaltender to blink once. \nUnfortunately for Eichel and the Sabres, they staggered through an offensively challenged first two periods, lost their starting goalie, Robin Lehner to a leg injury, had a goal by newcomer Evander Kane wiped away by the new coach's challenge rule (the play was offsides), and they fell to the Ottawa Senators 3-1.
