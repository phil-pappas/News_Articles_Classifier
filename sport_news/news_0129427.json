(Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP) Comments \nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love returned to the court for the first time since suffering a season-ending dislocated shoulder during the playoffs last April. \nLove's preseason debut was uneventful as the Cavaliers moved to 0-6, but third member of Cleveland's Big Three left the Air Canada Centre feeling good and looking ready for the regular season opener against Chicago on Oct. 27. \nThat was Sunday's top priority. \nLeaner and in the best shape of his life, according to head coach David Blatt, Love played 13 minutes, scoring six points on 2-of-7 shooting. \nHe also grabbed four rebounds, had two steals and dished out a pair of assists, including a nifty pass to new teammate Mo Williams early in the second quarter. Love's pass, which showcased his unique versatility, was one of the few highlights during an 87-81 loss against the Raptors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:03:03.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
