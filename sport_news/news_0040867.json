The Lady Dragons dominated host Canton 25-8, 25-4 Tuesday in a Mid-Illini Conference match, continuing their march toward the program record for single-season victories. Pekin (17-7, 6-3) is closing in on the record of 22 wins set in 2000. The Lady Dragons have already surpassed last year’s victory total of 15. Hannah Thompson (six digs, four aces), Haley Peterson (14 assists), Madison Cravens (eight kills) and Abbie Olsen (three aces) led Pekin against Canton. Runners ‘in good company’ The Pekin boys cross country team lost 28-29 Tuesday to host Metamora in a Mid-Illini dual meet, but there was a silver lining in the cloud of defeat. “The kids were disappointed to lose, but I think it showed them what’s possible next week at the conference meet,” said Coach Cole Stoner. “Anytime you can compete with Metamora, you’re in good company.” Metamora star Jake Gillum won the race (15:39.4), but Pekin’s five scoring runners all placed in the top nine. They were Kolton Dunkelbarger (2nd, 15:51.5), Alex Olar (3rd, 15:52.7), Tanner Heiple (6th, 16:10.6), Chase Paul (8th, 16:51.9) and Robbie Lawrence (9th, 16:55.1). The conference meet is Oct. 16 at Detweiller Park in Peoria. Metamora beat Pekin 23-38 in the girls race. Kari Lalumandier of the Redbirds was first across the finish line (18:30.4), but Pekin’s Paige Arseneau (2nd, 19:07.4) and Madison Stoller (3rd, personal-record 19:20.2) grabbed the next two places. Danielle Walker (10th, 20:59.9), Caroline Gilmore (11th, season-best 21:28.1) and Jayna Riley (12th, 21:42.2) also scored for the Lady Dragons. Winning record The Pekin girls tennis team has climbed over the .500 mark for the season in dual matches. The visiting Lady Dragons blanked non-conference rival Peoria 9-0 Tuesday and are now 6-5. Pekin won all nine matches against Peoria in straight sets. Mistakes hurt kickers Metamora beat visiting Pekin 5-1 Tuesday in a Mid-Illini boys soccer game, adding to the Dragons’ recent woes. Clay Jones had three goals for the Redbirds. Brendan Guenther scored the lone goal for Pekin (3-8-2, 2-3). “We made a lot of mistakes,” said Dragons coach Gus Kormah. Sophs split The Pekin sophomore football team has split its last two games. The Dragons lost 34-14 at East Peoria on Sept. 28 but beat Morton 39-22 at home Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:43:48.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
