Terry Collins has been seemingly unbothered by managing the New York Mets as a lame duck this season, as evidenced by his team sweeping the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS. The 66-year-old manager will almost certainly get an extension from the Mets in the near future, but he isn’t going to make them tack on too many years.\nAdChoices According to a report from Jon Heyman of CBSSports.com, Collins has told those close to him that he would be pleased with a two-year deal . At 66, he is the oldest manager in the game. Collins wants to spend time with his wife and enjoy retirement while he still can.\nCollins seems to be enjoying himself more than ever this season and has a great relationship with his players. A lot of that is the result of winning, but a lot of the winning is a result of Collins pulling the right strings both on the field and in the clubhouse.\nIt’s hard to believe the Mets are just four wins away from winning the World Series after they won less than 80 games in each of Collins’ first four seasons with the team. Six months ago, fans would have applauded if Collins was fired. Some of them even purchased billboard space to express their frustration with the team .\nAnd, now, it sounds like Collins is going to want to leave the Mets before they have had enough of him.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/baseball/mets-fans-billboard-urging-owners-to-sell-team/259657", "http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/writer/jon-heyman/25348295/mets-skipper-terry-collins-wont-seek-long-deal", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:22:27.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
