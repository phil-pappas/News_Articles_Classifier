But a leg injury in the second forced Thomas to the sideline, where he watched Peyton Barber's breakout 115-yard performance. \nThomas hasn't started a game since. He has just 143 yards on 29 carries through five games while dealing with minor but nagging injuries. \nAs long as he remains healthy and consistent, it appears Auburn will stick with Barber, who now has 558 yards on 109 carries. \n\"I don't think (Thomas) really lost anything, Peyton just kind of assumed the role late in the games and has been the guy who has carried the heavy load,\" offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said. \"Roc had been a little nicked up. We're going to need all those guys... Roc came in (against San Jose State) and was a great shot in the arm and change of pace. We're going to need him a lot more.\" \nThomas is a close friend and fan of Barber, who scored five times in Auburn's 35-21 win the Spartans. \n\"He had an awesome game,\" Thomas said. \"It's very exciting because our running back group individually is a great bond. So if one person does well we feel like we all did well because we all just have that connection and it really just spikes us up.\" \nSince arriving on the Plains in 2014 Thomas has been praised for his speed and elusiveness, drawing comparisons to former Auburn star Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams. Injuries and ball control have been his biggest issues, but there's more to Thomas than meets the eye. \nRELATED: Thomas knows the danger of his signature spin move \n\"He can outrun just about everybody or spin four times and make everyone miss, but a lot of people don't realize he is powerful,\" said Ryan Herring, Thomas' former coach at Oxford High School. \"That's not his first choice — he's more of a finesse and speed type guy, but from the waist down he's one of the strongest guys I've coached. \n\"He can jump out of a pool and land on his feet on the cement. A standing leap. I've never seen anybody do that. He's a freak of nature when it comes to that.\" \nThomas showed plenty of potential in high school, rushing for 414 yards and five touchdowns in a single game as a junior . He earned Alabama's Mr. Football Award as a senior with 2,211 yards and 32 scores. \nHis durability has been a concern since he's been at Auburn, but Thomas added some muscle in the spring and summer while focusing on running between the tackles instead of around them. \n\"I don't think anybody sees him as a power back, but I think he's a good fit for Auburn and a lot of things they do,\" Herring said. \"If he can keep that foot healthy he'll be all right... You know you aren't going to get carries if you're not healthy. I'm sure it's frustrating, but I know this — he'll get by. I know Coach (Gus) Malzahn has faith in him.\" \nThomas admits he feels \"a little bit underestimated\" when it comes to his power, but it was certainly on display against San Jose State. He made the most of his four carries one with less flash and more smash, averaging 9.8 yards per rush. \n\"He ran over a couple of guys, kept his feet moving and you could really tell he was determined,\" Malzahn said. \"A lot of that comes with confidence too. Being a second-year guy he's getting more carries, getting more confidence and he's getting better.\" \nMalzahn attributes Auburn's offensive struggles this season to a lack of explosive plays (gains of 20 yards or more) but feels Thomas is more than capable of getting the job done. \nWith Barber leading the rushing attack, Thomas has been a bright spot in the passing game and currently ranks second on the team in receiving yards with eight catches for 163 yards. He caught a 51-yard pass for a touchdown against Jacksonville State and ran 41 yards on a screen pass against San Jose State. \n\"He definitely did a good job for us,\" Malzahn said. \"You could see more of Roc Thomas. He had a couple of really good plays, one in the passing and a couple in the running game. You could see his role expand.\" \nThomas' focus during the off week has been centered on improvement as the Tigers aim for their first SEC win in Kentucky tonight. \n\"Just stay focused and keep getting better, because that's what we really need to do,\" Thomas said. \"We need to get back to playing how we can really play.\" Auburn RB Roc Thomas: Oct. 3, 2015 Auburn running back Roc Thomas breaks down his performance in the win over San Jose State on Oct. 3, 2015.
