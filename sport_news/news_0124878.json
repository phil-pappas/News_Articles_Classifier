He also holds a U.S. National 'A' Coaching Licence.\nManning's 22-year career in sports management has included executive positions with the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles, the NBA's Houston Rockets and, most recently, the MLS' Real Salt Lake, where he spent eight seasons before parting ways in August.\nDuring his time in Salt Lake, the club won an MLS Cup and Eastern Conference titles in 2009. Two years later, the team was CONCACAF Champions League runners up. In 2013, the club took the Western Conference title and was runner up in the MLS Cup.\nOff the field, Real Salt Lake's season tickets and sponsorship more than tripled within Manning's tenure, according to Monday's statement. Manning was also involved establishing, opening and selling the naming rights to the club's home base, Rio Tinto Stadium.\nHe is the MLSE's third president, joining Brendan Shanahan of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Masai Ujiri of the Toronto Raptors.\nMore to come.\nMore on thestar.com\n‘Turkey…Blue Jays…Cranberry sauce…Blue Jays’: Toronto fans hope they'll have more to be thankful for\nFox Sports commentator Harold Reynolds feeling the heat over Canada comment", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:34:55.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
