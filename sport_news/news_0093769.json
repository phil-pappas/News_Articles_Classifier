The answer is no,” NFL executive vice president Eric Grubman said. “It’s as earliest as January. And we’ve set it up to enable January. But we’re not committed to January. \n“If the facts and circumstances, whether they be short term -- meaning (one of the three clubs) is in the playoffs, or we need another piece of information that we’re not going to get until February -- or long term, that’s really up to the membership.” \nSeveral owners are now of the opinion at least one team will be in LA in 2016. Maybe two, if not right away. \nThe three clubs in question are tied to competing stadium plans. \nIn January, Rams owner Stan Kroenke partnered with Stockbridge Capital Group. Together they’re shovel-ready to construct a futuristic, privately financed, 80,000-seat, $1.86-billion stadium in Inglewood. \nThe Chargers and Raiders subsequently announced a joint venture to relocate to a different spiffy new stadium in a different LA suburb: Carson. That city has offered its breathless backing. \nBut if two teams are allowed to move to LA, the Rams and Chargers are seen as likeliest to gain league approval, with the Raiders shut out. In other words, the Chargers would bail on their joint venture with the Raiders in a heartbeat if the league wanted to pair them with Kroenke and his stadium plan. \nIt’s up to NFL owners to approve which team, or two teams, may move to LA, and whose stadium proposal gets green-lit. \nThe league’s committee on LA is composed of New England’s Robert Kraft, Houston’s Bob McNair, New York Giants’ John Mara, Carolina’s Jerry Richardson, Pittsburgh’s Art Rooney and Kansas City’s Clark Hunt. \nThat sextet is empowered to arrive at a final plan for all owners to consider. \nThe committee’s conundrum: of the three owners eyeing LA, Kroenke of the Rams has by far the deepest pockets (he’s the NFL’s third richest owner, per Forbes, with a net worth of $6.3 billion). And Kroenke possesses the better LA location and snazzier stadium design. \nBut his current market -- the city of St. Louis and the state of Missouri -- is fighting hardest of the three clubs to keep its team, even if St. Louis is the last place on earth Kroenke wants to locate his Rams. \nHere’s where this could all ultimately bog down. \nWhichever team, or teams, is chosen by the LA committee, 75% of broad NFL ownership must approve -- specifically, 24 of 32 owners. That means it only takes nine to scupper any relocation proposal(s). \nErgo, the growing feeling that plenty of back-room dealing and quiet negotiating, even arm-bending, will occur over the next two months, to figure out a palatable plan that’s fairest to all, and which full ownership will rubber stamp. \nNo one wants two, or even three, relocation showdown votes. \nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones probably is the most outspoken owner advocating immediate LA action. \nThe league hasn’t had a team there since 1995, when the Raiders bolted back to Oakland and the Rams to St. Louis. Now’s the time to rectify that, Jones said. And not with any watered-down solution. \n“I don’t look at this as a compromise,” Jones said Monday. “The NFL can’t compromise here. The best we know how to do, needs to land in LA. We’ve got some of the very best people associated with the league that want to be involved in LA. \n“LA doesn’t need middle ground. LA needs the best shot we’ve got.” \nAnd right away, he said. With all the stars finally aligned. \n“There is a cross-hairs,” Jones said. “These opportunities for stadiums (being built require) a coming together of billions of dollars, of locations, of all the right things. \n“When it all hits the cross-hairs, you nail it. Because they can take years to get in the cross-hairs (again), if ever. We’ve got one in the cross-hairs. We need to act on it.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:53:37.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
