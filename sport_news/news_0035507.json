But then came the final 16. \nThe host Blue Devils scored three goals in the final stretch, pulling away with a 3-0 victory. \n“We played a great first half and controlled the ball better than we have all year,” said Jefferson coach Tim Babcock. “The score was 0-0 and we had out-shot Evansville, 5-4. Evansville did hit the crossbar, but they really didn’t have a threat beside that. The players were fired up at half because we were playing so much better. However, we only had one sub and I was a little worried about fatigue. \n“Justin Wesley was our one sub and he did great playing nearly every position of the field to give each of our players 1-2 minutes of rest,” Babcock added. \nEvansville (9-5-1 overall, 6-3-0 RVC) broke a scoreless tie on Andy Forster’s goal at 73:46. Kevin Garcia was credited with the assist. But it wouldn’t be the last time the duo struck. \nGarcia scored an unassisted goal in the 77th minute, before Forster’s second goal of the night, at 78:47, gave the Blue Devils a 3-0 advantage. \n“Evansville finally scored with 16 minutes left on a corner kick. A minute later, Marcus Thoma had to leave the game when he had his knee stepped on. Unfortunately, we were not able to overcome this last bit of adversity and they scored two more quick ones,” said Babcock. \nThoma finished with seven saves, while Jose Luengas added one. \n“Jose Luengas was moved to sweeper and he played a great game; I thought it was the smartest game of his career. He was a true field captain who directed the ball perfectly,” said Babcock. “Marcus Thoma was a great leader in the goal and had a really steady and calming effect on our whole team. \n“This was a nice “building block” game. We walked away proud and hopeful for our final weeks,” added Babcock. \nThe Eagles (4-13-1, 2-10-0) play a rare Wednesday match hosting Columbus on Oct. 14. The non-conference match begins at 4 p.m. at Jefferson Athletic Field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:12:56.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
