With plenty of options to choose from on the Tar Heels’ roster of experienced talent, James immediately picked Isaiah Hicks. “We’ve all seen it in practice, the things he can do,” James said Friday night. “But it’s time for the world to see it, the player he can be. The kid’s amazing.” Hicks added to his promising preseason by way of a high-energy performance in the scrimmage that concluded North Carolina’s annual “Late Night with Roy” event at the SmithCenter. The junior forward, active in the paint and attacking the rim for a variety of point-blank buckets, supplied 14 points to help the White team defeat the Blue team 41-32. James said Hicks looks “hungry to prove to everyone what he can do” in the Tar Heels’ post rotation that figures to be topped by returning starters Brice Johnson and Kennedy Meeks, the team’s second- and third-leading scorers last season. “He’s a monster,” sophomore swingman Theo Pinson said of Hicks. “I can’t wait for him to just explode.” Justin Jackson added eight points and Marcus Paige chipped in seven points for the White team, which trailed 13-4 early in the 20-minute scrimmage that had a running clock. Later, in the last 75 seconds, Paige whipped a nifty pass to Hicks, who flashed open in the lane to deposit his final hoop. Johnson scored eight points, though he struggled a bit around the basket, and Stilman White had six points for the Blue team. Pinson’s five points came during the first 2½ minutes on a transition layup and a 3-pointer. Three weeks remain until North Carolina’s Nov. 13 opener against Temple. It’s a season of great expectations for the Tar Heels, ranked as the co-No. 1 in the USA Today coaches poll and almost certain to be chosen as the Atlantic Coast Conference favorite next week when that voting is conducted. On this night, the Tar Heels, partaking in dances, video skits and even sketch comedy, had some fun in front of a big crowd before the serious stuff starts. James, Hicks, White and Luke Maye joined UNC Bhangra Elite in full cultural dress as part of an Indian dance number. Coach Roy Williams said he particularly enjoyed the step show from members of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. A touching tone also emanated from Friday night. Stuart Scott, the ESPN personality and proud North Carolina alum, was honored with tributes that included emotional appearances by his daughters Taelor and Sydni and ESPN’s Sage Steele. Page 2 of 2 - Scott served as the high-volume host of this event for many years. “When I think of Late Night with Roy, I don’t think of Roy,” Williams said. “I think of Stuart Scott. “One night he said some very personal things to me and I told him how I felt about him, and it was one of the neatest feelings for two macho kind of guys to say that.” Earlier Friday in Chapel Hill, Scott was posthumously inducted into the North Carolina Journalism Hall of Fame.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:56:02.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
