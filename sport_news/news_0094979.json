It’s really a rivalry in all sports between our two schools. I know they get up for it, and so do we.” \nMcIntosh brings a 2-3 record into the region contest, including last week’s 35-6 victory over Morrow, a team Northgate beat 56-0 two weeks ago. \nThe Chiefs also beat Fayette County in a non-region game to open the season. \n“Every game is big from here on out,” Walburn said. \nThe Vikings can point to the play of their running backs for the quick start. \nTon Evans rushed for 167 yards and a touchdown in the victory against Mundy’s Mill and now has 703 yards and nine touchdowns. Fellow junior Kyle Cater had his best performance of the season after rushing for 112 yards and a touchdown despite losing the first fumble of the year by Northgate’s starting backfield. \nThe bulldozing fullback has rushed for 335 yards and seven touchdowns while helping the Vikings convert 55-percent of third-down conversions this year. \nSophomore quarterback Kyle McLaren only completed two passes last week, but one went for a touchdown. He also threw his first interception of the season. \n“I put that interception on myself,” Walburn said. “The positive thing to see was the way he balanced back from it. Sometimes we have to remind ourselves he is 15-years old.” \nMcLaren has connected with five receivers this year, and showed a new wrinkle against Mundy’s Mill, hitting Evans out of the backfield twice, one of which on a short touchdown throw that capped off an impressive 62-yard drive in 59 seconds just before halftime for a 22-7 advantage. \nDefensively, Northgate’s three senior linebackers each dominated play. Clemson recruit James Skalski led the way with 15 tackles, including a sack and a forced fumble. Kyle Feldbauer had eight tackles and fellow senior Carson Storey had six tackles to go with an interception and a fumble recovery. \nLineman Drew Latham, meanwhile, added seven tackles and forced a safety that pushed the Vikings to an early 9-0 lead. . \nObvious comparisons are being made between this year’s Northgate team and the one from 2011 that went undefeated until the playoffs. \n“There are some similarities.” Walburn said. “We knew in 2010 we had some good seniors, but the bulk of our teams was coming back with some really good young players, and that is the same way with this team. In 2013 we were playing a lot of sophomores, and in 2014 we thought we were on the right track, but we had all those injuries. I think this team is a little bigger up front on both sides of the ball.” \nWalburn noted the play of a senior offensive line, as well as senior wingback Kamari Ray after last week’s game. Ray opened the scoring with a 4-yard run last week. \nAfter Friday’s game, Northgate heads into its bye week before resuming the season back at home against Forest Park for Homecoming on Oct. 16. \n“It is always good to get some time off,” Walburn said. “However, sometimes when everything is going so well, it can break up your momentum.” More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:20:45.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
