They continue to remain at the bottom of the eight-team event while Goa FC are now at the second spot with seven points from four matches. \nZico made as many as five changes to the Goan team, which had lost 4-0 to Chennaiyin FC. \nLaxmikant Katiimani, CS Sabeeth, Jonatan Lucca, Bikramjit Singh and Luciano Sabrosa made their way into the first team. \nNorthEast United's defence was maintaining a high line as Reinaldo came twice to being through on ball but was flagged offside inside the first 10 minutes. \nThe home team took the lead when Raju Yumnam's cross from the left found Sanju Pradhan on the right. He rounded off Debabrata Roy and crossed for Francis Dadzie at the far post who headed home with ease. \nEight minutes later, Pradhan had another chance as he breezed past Roy on the right and crossed for Dadzie which he couldn't connect under pressure from Gregory Arnolin. \nIn the 27th minute, Silas and Kamara combined with the latter finding Pradhan in plenty of space. The winger's cross was too close to Kattimani this time around. \nFC Goa replied back in the 28th minute when Sabeeth ran down the left and found Jofre on the edge of the box. The Spaniard laid it back for Jonatan Lucca who curled it inside with his right foot. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:26:46.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
