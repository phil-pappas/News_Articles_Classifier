(Elsa/Getty Images/AFP) By : Larry Fine | on 11:44 AM October 13,   Baseball/Softball \nNew York. The New York Mets, stinging from a costly loss, mauled the visiting Los Angeles Dodgers 13-7 on Monday to move within one win of reaching the National League Championship Series. \nThe Citi Field crowd alternated between roars of delight for sluggers Curtis Granderson, Yoenis Cespedes and Travis d'Arnaud and taunting chants for bench-riding Dodger Chase Utley as the Mets seized a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five Division Series. \nUtley, whose two-game suspension for a fierce slide into New York's Ruben Tejada that broke the Mets shortstop's right leg in Game Two awaits an appeal, did not get into the game. \nYet the stadium rocked with chants of \"Utley Sucks\" and \"We Want Utley\" as New York's lead grew. \nThe Dodgers struck first with four hits in a row in the top of the second for three runs off winning starter Matt Harvey, but the Mets quickly did them one better. \nA booming, bases-loaded double off the center field fence by Granderson in the bottom of the second put New York ahead 4-3. \nD'Arnaud lined a two-run homer to left in the third off losing starter Brett Anderson and Cespedes capped a four-run fourth with a three-run blast that turned it into a rout. \nA three-run homer in the ninth by Howie Kendrick narrowed the gap. \nGame Four will be played in New York on Tuesday with three-time Los Angeles Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw taking the mound on short rest against Mets' rookie Steven Matz. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:25:30.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
