FILE - In this July 31, 2009, file photo, Los Angeles Lakers' Lamar Odom speaks to the media during a news conference after the Lakers signed Odom to a multi-year NBA basketball contract, in El Segundo, Calif. Odom spent most of his 14-year NBA career in Los Angeles with the Lakers and Clippers, becoming a fan favorite before he sought even more fame with the Kardashians. Odom, who was embraced by teammates and television fans alike for his Everyman approach to fame, was found face-down and alone Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, after spending four days at the Love Ranch, a legal Nevada brothel. (AP Photo/Jeff Lewis, File) \nAlvina Alston, publicist for Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer, said Monday that the former reality-TV personality is alert and undergoing testing, but there's no word yet on when he might be released from the hospital. \nMercer said in a statement that Odom is overcoming \"insurmountable obstacles\" and defying the odds. \nThe statement says, \"Each day Lamar is getting stronger and reaching significant milestones in his recovery.\" \nOdom was found in extremely critical condition at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, on Oct. 13. The brothel said workers saw him drink alcohol and take supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" \nHis family, including estranged wife Khloe Kardashian, rushed to Las Vegas to be by his side. \nThink your friends should see this?
