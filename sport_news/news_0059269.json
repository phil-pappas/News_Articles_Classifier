Khattar was visiting NDRI today for a state-level programme organised on the completion of one year of the Swachh Bharat Mission. He said as many as 88 per cent toilets have been constructed, but their maintenance was a cause for concern. “People should adopt the habit of cleanliness, which would only be achieved with clean mind and soul,” Khattar said. Khattar lauded the efforts of Dera Sacha Sauda, Dera Radha Swami Beas and others for contributing by holding cleanliness drives and making the people aware about it. He urged the social, religious and other organisations to contribute in Clean India, Clean Haryana mission. He called upon the officers to prepare pilot projects regarding cleanliness and install them after the success. Project should be highlighted on the website of the department. Khattar, meanwhile, directed the officials to open a website for cleanliness only. Khattar, accompanied by Cabinet Minister Kavita Jain, CPS Bakshish Singh and others, announced to honour the ward, committee, council and Corporation to contribute in 100 per cent toilets campaign. He said the ward with 100 per cent clean toilets would get cash reward of Rs 1 lakh, Municipal Committee of Rs 5 lakh, Municipal Council of Rs 10 lakh and Municipal Corporation of Rs 20 lakh. He also announced to give a rebate of 10 per cent on property tax to the people contributing in promoting garbage collection from door to door. Additional Chief Secretary Navraj Sandhu said the government had constructed 23.57 lakh toilets across the state so far, while rest of the toilets would be constructed by 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:09:44.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
