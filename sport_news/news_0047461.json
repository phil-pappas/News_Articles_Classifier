(Photo by Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Jurgen Klopp took charge of his first Liverpool game yesterday against Tottenham.\nAdChoices Andrew Powell Getty Images Jurgen Klopp says his new Liverpool team exceeded expectations in his first game in charge, as they grabbed a goalless draw at Tottenham.\nThe German, who succeeded Brendan Rodgers last week, was pleased with their performance after just four days training with the squad and a string of injury blows to first-team players.\n\"I am satisfied with the start because I didn't have the biggest expectations,\" Klopp said after the 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane.\n\"Tottenham are a very strong and well-tuned team. It was difficult but I am really satisfied. Our start was brilliant and we surprised their team a little bit.\n\"The problem we had in the game was that, when we had the ball, we weren't cool enough, nor used our skills. We were too hectic. We didn't see the right option, when you should open your view.\n\"We had our moments, but after three or four days with the team it was brilliant.\"\nKlopp lost Daniel Sturridge to a minor knee problem hours before Saturday's kick-off, while Danny Ings and Joe Gomez were ruled out for the season with knee ligament injuries this week.\nKlopp admitted it was not ideal preparation to have just one fit striker in Divock Origi but he will continue to work on improving the team with the players he does have at his disposal.\n\"It's true we have had a bad week with injuries this week. Daniel is not serious but I said I was pleased we had four quality strikers when I came in and now we have only one,\" he said.\n\"That's not the best situation but I don't think about players I don't have because it doesn't make sense to.\n\"We work 24 hours for the players to come back. Ings needs time, but Christian Benteke doesn't need the same time. Maybe he will be back next week. The best situation is when all players are 100% but that doesn't happen very often.\n\"Now we have to work with the team. It is good to have a zero against our name but we are not obsessed with this. We have to get to know each other and get better in the things we want to do.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:05:30.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
