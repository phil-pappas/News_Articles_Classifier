(AP) — The Atlanta Falcons will be without linebacker Justin Durant and center Mike Person for Thursday night’s game against the New Orleans Saints. \nDurant (elbow) and Person (ankle) were both ruled out after missing a short week of practice for the Falcons (5-0). Durant will be missing his second straight game. \nJames Stone gets his first start of the season at center, always a crucial position for the visiting team in the raucous Superdome. \nStar receiver Julio Jones is expected to play despite lingering hamstring and toe issues. He took part in Wednesday’s light workout before the team left for New Orleans. \nJones is listed as probable along with running back Devonta Freeman (toe) and receiver Leonard Hankerson (ribs), who both participated fully in the final practice heading into the game.
