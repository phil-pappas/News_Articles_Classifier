But the Cougars' Air Raid attack, which ranks seventh nationally, piles up yardage against every opponent.\nPenn State had no need to test Rutgers' pass defense because the Nittany Lions rushed for 330 yards in a 28-3 win on Sept. 19 . Wins over Norfolk State and Kansas weren't particularly revealing, either, because both offenses were too inept to pose a serious test.\nRutgers should finally get some answers on Saturday night against a Michigan State offense led by quarterback Connor Cook, who is projected as a first-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\"They're good up front so they do a good job protecting Cook and Cook is a very good quarterback that can fit the balls into tight spaces,\" interim coach Norries Wilson said. \"So (defensive coordinator Joe) Rossi and (defensive backs coach Darrell) Wilson are going to do a good job just making sure the guys read their keys and stay in the zones they're supposed to be in, and if we're playing man the coverage will be able to guard their man and make the throws contested and hopefully we come up with a few.\"\nCook's yardage numbers are pedestrian (195.4 yards per game), but he has thrown 10 touchdowns and just one interception to lead the fourth-ranked Spartans to a 5-0 start. Cook carved up Rutgers in a 45-3 win last season , completing 16-of-24 passes for 254 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.\nThe Scarlet Knights had just one sack in last year's meeting and they have been limited to eight sacks in the first four games of this season. Rutgers will need to generate pressure on Cook to prevent the fifth-year senior from exposing a secondary that likely will feature two redshirt freshmen (cornerback Isaiah Wharton and strong safety Kiy Hester) and a true freshman in the starting lineup (cornerback Blessuan Austin).\n\"Whatever Joe Rossi and the defensive staff comes up with, they're going to come up with sound schemes, things that they think are best to apply pressure to the quarterback or to contest the throws and interrupt the passing lanes,\" Wilson said. \"I'm sure he and (linebackers coach Bob) Frasier and Coach Wilson and (defensive line coach Jim) Panagos have some things together that they think are going to help put our best foot forward.\"\nHere's a look at some of the highlights from practice:\nLocation: Practice field F-3\nDuration: 1 hour, 57 minutes\nPads: Helmets and shoulder pads\nWeather: 64, mostly cloudy\nFirst word\nNorries Wilson's post-practice opening statement:\n\"Good afternoon. I appreciate everybody coming by. Had a normal Wednesday practice, worked on our third down things, got some goal-line looks in, got some speed against the defense, they got some speed against us running some opponent stuff servicing each other. It wasn't perfect, but I think it was a good practice. Working on their blitzes and working on their various looks that they're going to give the defense with their offense and of course we did special teams.\"\nTake two\nA pair of notable comments from Wilson\n1. On Michigan State's run defense:\n\"They're very good against the run. They've got two tackles on the inside, they're very good players. The two ends on the outside are not a step down from the inside guys. Their linebackers play downhill and they attack the run and they tear offensive linemen off of double teams so the defensive line is clear to shed and get off blocks. They're well-coached up front. Our offensive line and running backs and tight ends are going to have to step up and fight and push and move a guy against his will.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:21:35.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
