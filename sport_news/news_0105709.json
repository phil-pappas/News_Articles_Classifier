Cricket? No. IPL? No. Chennai Super Kings? No. BCCI? No, no, no! Their topic of discussion could find a place in Ripley's Believe it or Not. They discussed dogs.\nDogs and their mutual admiration for dogs dominated the 30-mieeting the two had at the latter's Boat Club residence in Chennai. Dhoni is a known dog lover and we hear Srinivasan has a kennel for dogs. He brings up about 12 dogs, of different breed and hue.\n\"What is wrong if they met? Neither has committed a crime. Srinivasan is the chairman of the ICC and Dhoni is the captain of India. Srinivasan is the MD of India Cements and Dhoni is its vice president. They know each other for 12 years. So there can be enough things to chat and one of their common interests is dogs,\" said a source who was privy to the meeting. \"They did not discuss cricket,\" the source claimed.\nThat sure is hard to believe, particularly the meeting coming in the backdrop of the IPL and suspension of Chennai Super Kings.\nMeanwhile, the Indian team management claimed ignorance about the meeting. \"I have no idea who Dhoni met. He meets so many people,\" Indian team manager Vinod Phadke said. It must, however, be mentioned that Dhoni did not breach any protocol by visiting Srinivasan the day after the match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:04:42.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
