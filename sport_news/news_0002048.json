(AP) Miami has fired coach Al Golden, midway through his fifth season and one day after the Hurricanes endured the worst loss in the program's 90-year history. \nGolden went 32-25 with the Hurricanes and 17-18 in Atlantic Coast Conference play, his entire stint marred by an NCAA investigation and subsequent fallout caused by things that happened before he arrived in Coral Gables. His last game with Miami was a 58-0 loss to then-No. 6 Clemson, a result that had fans booing from the stands and calling for his departure _ as many had for some time. \nMiami (4-3, 1-2 ACC) plays at Duke on Saturday night. Larry Scott will take over as Miami's interim head coach. The Hurricanes are scheduled to resume practice Tuesday. All content Â© Copyright 2000 - 2015 WorldNow and KLKN.
