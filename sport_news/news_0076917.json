GMs were not allowed to vote for their own team or personnel; the percentages were based on the pool of respondents to a particular question, rather than all 30 decision-makers. \nMinnesota turned up in some expected -- and unexpected -- places in the survey. Below are listed the question and response for any section that included someone from the Wolves. \n- Which player is most likely to have a breakout season in 2015-16? Second-year swing man Andrew Wiggins was first with 17.2 percent of the vote. Third-year forward Shabazz Muhammed was a player who also received votes. \n- Who will win the 2015-16 Rookie of the Year? Center Karl-Anthony Towns was second, after 76ers center Jahlil Okafor , with 34.5 percent of the vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:00:27.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
