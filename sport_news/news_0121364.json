As expected the request for tickets from family and friends was more than he thought. “I’m not sure what the count is, at least 10, 11, 12. Maybe 13.”\nForward Adam Cracknell is the leading the Canucks in goals, and he’s excited to go head-to-head against a number of familiar faces. “I’m nervous for sure. It’s fun playing against old friends, I was with the Blues organization for five or six years.”\nThe Blues, who lost all three meetings against Vancouver last season, are coming off a 4-2 win last night in Edmonton.\nRyan Miller is expected to start for the Canucks. St. Louis will likely turn to Jake Allen after Brian Elliott went the distance last night.\nPuck drop at 7 pm and can be seen live on Sportsnet Vancouver Hockey.\nCanucks | hockey | nhl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:52:55.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
