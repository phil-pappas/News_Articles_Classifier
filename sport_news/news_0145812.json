Spiller with a short pass that the running back turned into an 80-yard touchdown - the 400th of the Saints quarterback's career - on the second play of overtime, and New Orleans won for the first time this season, 26-20 over the injury-decimated Cowboys on Monday night. \nBrees, who missed New Orleans' previous game because of a bruised rotator cuff in his right (throwing) shoulder, completed 33 of 41 throws for 359 yards and two TDs in his return. \nMark Ingram gained 126 yards from scrimmage on a combination of runs and short passes, and Khiry Robinson had a 1-yard touchdown run for New Orleans (1-3). \nJoseph Randle scored the lone TD for Dallas (2-2) on a 1-yard run in the first half. The winning score enlivened a Superdome crowd stunned by Saints kicker Zach Hocker's 30-yard miss in the final seconds of regulation. \nTEXANS-FALCONS \nFreeman leads Falcons to another win, 48-21 over Texans \nATLANTA (AP) - Devonta Freeman scored three more touchdowns and the Atlanta Falcons remained unbeaten, romping to a 48-21 victory over the hapless Houston Texans on Sunday. \nFreeman, who took over as the starting running back after rookie Tevin Coleman sustained a rib injury in Week 2, has scored six TDs in the last two games. The Falcons improved to 4-0 for only the fourth time in franchise history. \nFreeman had touchdown runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards. He set up another score with a 44-yard reception. \nNothing went right for the Texans (1-3). Quarterback Ryan Mallett was yanked after the Falcons built a 42-0 lead. Running back Arian Foster made his season debut after tearing his groin early in training camp, but he couldn't find any room to run. \nIn fact, he had the ball knocked out of his hands by one of his own teammates, leading to a Falcons touchdown. \nASTROS-DIAMONDBACKS \nHouston headed to playoffs despite 5-3 loss to Arizona \nPHOENIX (AP) - The Houston Astros are going to the playoffs for the first time in a decade despite ending the regular season with a 5-3 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday. \nThe Astros led the AL wild-card race by a game heading into Sunday. They shared a few high fives in the dugout in the eighth inning after clinching it when the Los Angeles Angels lost to Texas. \nHouston finished 86-76 to reach the postseason for the first time since playing the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 World Series. The Astros will play their first American League playoff game Tuesday night, against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. \nNot bad for a team that had three 100-loss seasons before going 70-92 in 2014. \nArizona went 79-83 in its first season under general manager Dave Stewart and manager Chip Hale, a 15-game improvement from finishing with baseball's worst record in 2014. \nANGELS-RANGERS \nRangers win AL West on final day, Hamels beat Angels 9-2 \nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Cole Hamels and the Texas Rangers finally clinched the AL West title on the last day of the regular season. \nHamels pitched a three-hitter, Adrian Beltre hit a go-ahead homer and the Rangers beat the Angels 9-2 Sunday, eliminating Los Angeles from playoff contention. \nA year after their 95 losses were the most in the American League, two months after they were still eight games out of first place and three days after ensuring themselves a postseason spot, the Rangers wrapped up their sixth division title. \nTexas plays its first AL division series game since 2011 on Thursday at Toronto or Kansas City. \nMoments after the final out, AL West championship banners already were flying at the ballpark. The Rangers will go there under first-year manager Jeff Banister, whose team lost ace Yu Darvish to Tommy John surgery before the season started. \nCOWBOYS-INJURIES \nCowboys' Lee out with concussion vs. Saints \nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - Dallas Cowboys linebacker Sean Lee has been diagnosed with a concussion and ruled out for the remainder of Sunday night's game against the New Orleans Saints. \nKick returner and running back Lance Dunbar has been helped off the field with an apparent knee injury. \nLee is one of Dallas' top defensive players. He was named NFC defensive player of the week after a Week 2 victory over Philadelphia in which he was in on 14 tackles and intercepted a pass. His last tackle on Sunday night came when he helped bring down tight end Ben Watson on the Dallas 3 late in the first quarter. \nDunbar, a New Orleans native, appeared to have twisted his knee returning the kickoff to open the second half. \nMLS-DYNAMO-FC DALLAS \nFC Dallas clinches playoff berth, sweeps Dynamo with 4-1 win \nFRISCO, Texas (AP) - David Texeira scored twice, and Kellyn Acosta added a third second-half goal and FC Dallas beat the Houston Dynamo 4-1 on Sunday to become the first Western Conference team to clinch a playoff spot. \nTexeira put Dallas ahead when he fired a rocket from 20 yards that caromed off the crossbar in the 51st minute. Kellyn Acosta one-timed a shot off the crossbar 2 minutes later, and Texeira added an insurance goal in the third minute of stoppage time. \nComing off back-to-back losses on the road, including a 3-2 loss to the L.A. Galaxy, FC Dallas (14-10-5) beat the Dynamo for the fifth consecutive time and swept all three meetings this season. \nRicardo Clark scored from 15 yards to pull Houston even after Mauro Diaz scored on a penalty kick to give Dallas the early lead.
