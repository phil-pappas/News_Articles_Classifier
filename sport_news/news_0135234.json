Mark wishes to bring a sense of urgency now behind the plans for and completion of road projects. He wants collected dollars to be translated/converted into new transportation projects for handling congestion and improving traffic flow. \nHis professional career includes more than 30 years working with permitting issues for cities and counties plus formal education as an urban planner. A longtime resident of Sammamish who has raised two children here, Mark cares for quality of life, trees and the environment. He knows and understands development codes for controlling growth versus having it control us. Smart use of codes helps preserve the flavor and character of our Sammamish, while permitting new choices like shopping at the Metropolitan Market. \nStaff at the city is incredibly busy dealing with all the new growth and construction. High turnover has occurred — now more than ever, our city needs solid experience and expertise! Mark desires to return to the City Council because he has developed excellent working relationships. Mark knows the code, procedures and processes, thus he will effectively work toward benefiting all Sammamish citizens. \nI have known Mark Cross personally for many years. He is a problem-solver who will find and make time to get community input and work hard to get things done. Vote for Mark Cross who will rededicate his time and experience to impact you for the better. \nMary Wictor \nWritten by Contributed · Filed Under Letters to the Editor \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:30:37.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
