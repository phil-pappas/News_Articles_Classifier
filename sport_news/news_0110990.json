Jimmy Butler is going to start, almost certainly at shooting guard, and Derrick Rose will be the point guard whenever he's healthy.\nrelated advertisement video Hoiberg talks about Rose Small forward is an open competition during training camp since Mike Dunleavy is expected to miss at least the first month of the regular season while recovering from back surgery. Tony Snell and Doug McDermott are the obvious candidates to fill this spot, Nikola Mirotic could be a factor and anyone who plays well has a chance to keep the role permanently.\nAt power forward and center, Hoiberg might experiment during preseason. Pau Gasol is almost guaranteed to start, but he didn't always mesh well with Joakim Noah last season. Meanwhile, Taj Gibson is feeling livelier after offseason ankle surgery, and Mirotic had a chance to bond with Gasol on the Spanish national team last month.\nAfter Friday's practice at the Advocate Center, Hoiberg said he's already been watching how Gasol and Noah work together during scrimmages.\n\"They've played well off each other,\" Hoiberg said. \"The big thing with Jo is being more patient when he's on the baseline as opposed to just flashing as an action is going on where he can muddy up the spacing a bit.\n\"Jo is a very good playmaker. You have to utilize him in that role. I think he and Pau have been good together so far. I'm excited to get those two on the floor together once we start playing preseason games, and I know those two guys are as well.\"\nFor now, Hoiberg will commit only to playing Noah and Gasol together during preseason. He's going to wait and see how everything works out before changing gameplans for the regular season.\nThe Bulls' four main big men all bring something a little different to the table. Gasol can play in the post, but scores most of his points on faceup jumpers. He might be ready to step out to the 3-point line more often, considering he hit 10 of 15 shots from long range for Spain in the European championships.\nNoah's specialty is passing and making plays for others. He was reluctant to launch his tornado jumper last season, but that may return if he's feeling healthier.\nGibson is the best leaper of the bunch, can hit midrange jumpers and has underrated post moves. He has adjusted to playing a reserve role behind Gasol, Noah and Carlos Boozer in recent years, but isn't locked into it.\n\"Every year since I've been in the NBA, I put forth effort to try to get a starting spot,\" Gibson said. \"That's been my job every year. Every year you try to improve and try to get better. (Lineups are based) on what's best for the team. That's how I am.\"\nMirotic remains a wild card since he doesn't have a set position. Last year, coach Tom Thibodeau started off saying he wanted to use Mirotic mainly at power forward, but he ended up having good success at small forward. The former Real Madrid star didn't shoot well from long range as a rookie and was most effective when attacking the rim.\n\"Niko's a basketball player, and very versatile,\" Hoiberg said. \"(He) shot the heck out of it the last two days. Been running him at the four and three. I think he's more comfortable at the four right now because that's where he was getting a lot of his reps early on, but we've been sticking around after, getting together early, and putting him in that three spot so that he can learn that as well.\"\nA wild card in this decision is the improved health of Noah and Gibson. Noah struggled last season on a sore knee, which he says is much better this year. Gibson said he had forgotten what it was like to play without pain in his left foot, so the surgery in June changed his outlook.\n\"Playing with a torn ligament in my foot, I thought that was just normal,\" Gibson said. \"I didn't really understand about playing pain-free. I just went out and did the best I can and try to help my team win. This year, I feel great. I feel completely different. It feels like my rookie year, the way I'm able to dunk and jump.\"\nGibson has been held out of some practices as he recovers from the surgery. He wouldn't guarantee he'll be available on opening night (Oct. 27), but everything seems to be trending well for him.\n\"Man, I'm banging with the rook, Bobby (Portis), then I'm going against Niko, then maybe I get a little physical with Joakim,\" Gibson said. \"Every day is real physical. My wind is up and down (from) running. It's fun. But every night it's all about seeing the training staff and getting realigned.\"\nRose still absent: Derrick Rose was scheduled to have a follow-up with the doctor on Friday, two days after surgery to repair an orbital bone fracture below his left eye.\n\"I was able to communicate with him last night, and he's really looking forward to getting back here around the guys, and he feels good,\" coach Fred Hoiberg said. \"Hopefully we'll get him back in the gym (Saturday).\"\nHoiberg thinks watching practice will be valuable for Rose, since the new coaching staff is teaching a new system.\nâ€¢ Get the latest news on the Bulls via Twitter by following @McGrawDHBulls.\n NBA Bulls Basketball Pro Men", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/1659832549/201510/2667/1659832549_4527302740001_4527187025001-vs.jpg?pubId=1659832549&ExactW=280&ExactH=156&ExactFit=crop&Q=100&noborder"], "published": "2015-10-03T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:32:23.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
