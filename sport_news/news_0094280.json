He became the GM after that World Series and the Phillies made it back to the World Series in 2009 but lost to the Yankees. The Phillies won three division titles while Amaro worked there. The Phillies dismissed him last month.\n“I am truly honored to join the Red Sox, a first-class organization with a tremendous history,” said Amaro in a statement. “I was honored that (Red Sox president) Dave (Dombrowski) and (manager) John (Farrell) would consider me for this opportunity and add me to this dynamic coaching staff. I am poised, focused, and ready to bring anything I can in terms of experience and knowledge to this position, and I look forward to being a part of the Boston Red Sox.”\nAmaro, a teammate of Farrell's in Cleveland in 1994, played for eight seasons between 1991 and 1998 with the Phillies, Angels and Indians. He was a career .235 hitter with 16 home runs and 100 RBI in 485 games.\nAmaro is the son of Ruben Amaro Sr, an 11-year major leaguer and together they are the only father-and-son combination to play for the Phillies. A graduate of Stanford University (human biology major), Amaro played on the school's College World Series championship team in 1987.\nAmaro and Farrell will be on a conference call together later this afternoon.\nAmaro replaces first base coach Arnie Beyeler, who was not retained by the Red Sox at the season's end. All other coaches will be returning.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Red+Sox+appoint+Ruben+Amaro+Jr.+as+new+1B+coach"], "published": "2015-10-26T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:41:28.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
