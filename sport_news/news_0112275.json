(AP) - A Massachusetts high school field hockey team has set a national record for its sport by putting together a 154-game unbeaten streak spanning six years. \nWatertown beat Melrose 6-0 on Wednesday to set the mark. Watertown (16-0), which has won six consecutive state championships, has not lost since the Division 2 state tournament semifinals in the fall of 2008. \nEileen Donahue, who has coached the team for 30 years, called the victory “an emotional moment,” saying it probably won’t sink in until the end of the season. \nThe streak includes three ties. The girls team has shut out 40 of its last 41 opponents. \nThe previous record was set by Eastern High School of Voorhees, New Jersey, from 1999 to 2005, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:04:50.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
