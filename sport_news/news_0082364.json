We had some tough games there,\" Williams said as she hopes to claw her way into the eight-player WTA Finals in Singapore later this month. \nShe is currently 11th in the Road to Singapore rankings after a resurgent season and Hong Kong is her last chance to get the points she needs. \n\"I've been under a lot of pressure in my career, playing big moments, all that experience hopefully will help me,\" she said as she looked ahead to Saturday's semi-final.
