There are a handful of players who are performing better than an 0-3 record might indicate, despite how much the Saints appear to be falling apart at every turn.\nThere might not be more than a handful of those players, but there's at least one. Here's a look at players excelling during the first three games:\nTerron Armstead\nZach Strief's Quote: during training camp where Strief pinned expectations as possibly one of the best all-time offensive tackles on Armstead likely will stick throughout the Saints left tackle's career. That's a statement that can't be ignored.\nArmstead couldn't be off to a better start in 2015.\nHe ranks as the top-rated tackle in the NFL on either side by Pro Football Focus. The left tackle has only allowed two pressures in 97 pass protection snaps the past two games.\nNo one is getting around Armstead these days.\n\"First, you look at his physical traits,\" Drew Brees said Wednesday. \"He's extremely talented, extremely athletic, which helps. But the most important thing about him is his mindset.\"\nBrees recalled how quickly Armstead adjusted when making his first start under fire in Week 16 of 2013 at Carolina going heads up with Greg Hardy. Brees called it the moment the team saw Armstead's competitive streak.\n\"He's one of those guys that he came into this league I think more mature and just beyond where normally a rookie tackle would come into this league. He's continued to get better.\"\nDelvin Breaux/Damian Swann\nThe Saints' top cornerback, Keenan Lewis, told reporters Wednesday, \"I'm up. I'm going,\" when asked if he'll return to action for the first time this season after sports hernia surgery after the third preseason game.\nAnd Lewis is more than thrilled to watch the development at cornerback since his temporary departure.\nBreaux shook off his first two games riddled with holding penalties and an embarrassing moment on deep coverage in the Tampa Bay loss. Breaux took away his side of the field against Carolina.\nLewis described Breaux as playing at a \"lockdown level.\"\n\"It doesn't really surprised me,\" Lewis said. \"That's a guy I knew my whole life. I already knew what he's been working with. ... He's a lockdown corner. You watch him on tape. He blankets guys. He knows what his job is. That's what he do.\"\nAs for Swann, he's played consistently well during every game this season. Amazing to say for a fifth-round pick in his rookie season. He's hopped around from cornerback and safety during the first three weeks.\n\"Very special guy with a bright future,\" Lewis said. \"A guy who can come in as a rookie, and they've thrown so much at him. Three different positions: corner, nickel and safety. He's definitely going to be a star in this league.\"\nSean Payton even recognized during his Wednesday presser how hard it would be to take Breaux and/or Swann off the field when Lewis returns.\nMaybe he won't ...\nWillie Snead\nYes, he fumbled against Tampa Bay in a crucial situation. And yes, his drop in the fourth quarter visibly broke players' hearts on the sideline.\nBut there's no doubt you can argue that Snead is the second most potent weapon in the receiving corps. His snaps have increased every game, and he's caught nine passes for 88 yards and one touchdown in the last two games.\nThat may not sound like much, but it's an uptick at receiver.\nMax Unger\nThe two-time Pro Bowl center has brought what you would have hoped in the trade from Seattle involving Jimmy Graham. There hasn't been much penetration up the gut from his position as we saw last year.\nKeenan Lewis looks forward to return from injury as Saints prep for Cowboys | Video Keenan Lewis looks forward to return from injury as Saints prep for Cowboys | Video\nMarcus Murphy\nThe preseason superstar wouldn't have made this list before Week 3, and really wouldn't have made this list if he didn't receive a second chance to return a punt after a penalty nullified another muffed punt in Carolina. His explosive punt return for a touchdown is a spark the Saints need in special teams.\nHau'oli Kikaha\nHe's still learning the nuances of playing a traditional strongside linebacker. Yet the second-round pick has at least been present around the ball to create two turnovers and picked up a sack in each of the last two games.\nBobby Richardson\nThe undrafted rookie free agent could become a starter on the defensive front thanks to the Saints trading away Akiem Hicks on Wednesday for Patriots tight end Michael Hoomanawanui. Richardson has been a nice piece to the defensive front, playing both end and on the inside. Plus, his pressure on Jameis Winston helped Kikaha force the fumble in Week 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:27:19.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
