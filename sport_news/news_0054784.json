Their playoff hopes are probably gone with a loss. Texas Tech could claim its third straight Big 12 win and first victory over a ranked team since the 2013 Holiday Bowl. \nKEY MATCHUP \nTexas Tech QB Patrick Mahomes vs. Oklahoma secondary. Mahomes ranks third nationally in total offense and yards passing per game. Oklahoma ranks ninth nationally in pass defense. Oklahoma defensive backs Zack Sanchez and Jordan Thomas have combined for five interceptions in three Big 12 games for a unit that has surrendered just 91 yards passing per league game. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nTexas Tech: RB DeAndre Washington. The Red Raiders need Washington to balance their pass-heavy attack. He averages 107 yards rushing per game. Oklahoma LB Eric Striker leads the Big 12 in sacks and tackles for loss during Big 12 play. Texas Tech could slow him with an effective ground game. \nOklahoma: QB Baker Mayfield. He started his career at Texas Tech as a true freshman walk-on and opened the 2013 season as the starter. He eventually lost the job, left Tech and walked on at Oklahoma. He sat out last year because of transfer rules, and then won the starting job this year. He ranks among the nation's leaders in passing efficiency, total offense and yards passing per game. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nTexas Tech ranks third nationally with 49.4 points per game, and second with 623.7 yards of total offense per contest. ... Oklahoma RB Samaje Perine ran for 213 yards in last year's win over the Red Raiders. ... Mayfield was the Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year for Texas Tech in 2013. ... Texas Tech allows 553.6 yards per game and ranks 122nd out of 127 FBS teams in total defense. ... Oklahoma is coming off a 55-0 win at Kansas State. \nAll content copyright Â©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:27:27.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
