I'm disgusted with him, but this is his one chance to put the team on his shoulders then you have my faith back.\"\nWill had made his point and then hung up.\nFrancesa was surprised at the emotion in his voice and didn't exactly lend a comforting shoulder for Will to lean on after the call.\n\"Will, are you crying,\" Francesa asked. \"You're not really crying over this I hope.\"\nYou can hear the exchange below.\nGame 3 of the NLDS is Monday night at CitiField in New York. The series is tied at 1-1. First pitch is at 8:30 p.m.\nHere's hoping you can call Francesa on Tuesday with tears of joy in your eyes this time, Will.\nContact Brent Axe: Email | Twitter\nListen to \"On the Block\" with Brent Axe weekdays from 5-6 p.m. on ESPN Radio Syracuse", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/brentaxemedia", "http://thebiglead.com/2015/10/11/new-york-mets-fan-cries-radio-mike-francesa-chase-utley/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "https://youtu.be/6M8szlSa-8o", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BheBEQIKUxI"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:01:50.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
