The first half was spent establishing the Bengals as a legitimate Super Bowl contender. I whispered those words after the 4-0 start. We say them aloud now. They are without debate. \nThere's this stat Dan Hoard pointed out in sifting through the rubble yesterday: Since current playoff format started in 1990, 49% of teams that started 6-0 went to the Super Bowl. Not a prediction, just a stat #Bengals — Dan Hoard (@Dan_Hoard) October 18, 2015 \nFive undefeated teams remain. The Bengals live among them. Every team – maybe besides the Patriots – have questions about whether or not they can end up there. The Broncos have the aging arm of Peyton Manning, the Bengals an undeniable history of playoff failure. And even the Patriots still must win without the pedigree of Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner manning their corners. \nThe Bengals' drive to finish in the top two and earn a bye will be fun to follow. For me, however, the next 10 weeks now set up to be about one battle: Bengals-Steelers. Pittsburgh's back-to-back wins against San Diego and Arizona without Big Ben should be reason for Bengals fans to take notice. During this time frame this young Pittsburgh defense took major strides. And this offense was already going to be one of the best in football and has yet to play a game with Ben, Le'Veon Bell and Martavis Bryant together this season. \nThey are just two games back and welcome the Bengals to Heinz Field Nov. 1 for the first of two AFC North showdowns. \nThe Steelers schedule the rest of the way includes: Should win: Browns, @Browns, @Ravens, Raiders Suddenly not so daunting: @Seattle, Indianapolis Game-changers: Bengals, @Bengals, Broncos \nAs for the Bengals schedule the rest of the way, we originally thought this would be a brutal gauntlet through the league, but as happens every year, perspective changes weekly. For me, the Bengals remaining 10 games split into a clear haves and have nots this year. Should win: @49ers, Texans, Browns, @Browns, Ravens Suddenly not so daunting: Game-changers: Steelers, @Steelers, @Broncos, Rams, @Arizona \nIf we want to start getting truly presumptuous, you can speculate the Bengals should go at least 4-1, if not 5-0 against the top five games considering how easily they've handled lesser opponents this year. Toss in three games against Denver, St. Louis and Arizona then you hope to 2-1 in those. That leaves the Steelers to decide the difference between the range of 14-2 and 11-5. The latter could very easily turn 6-0 into a road playoff game in the first round again. \nThis, of course, was the same scenario last year. Had the Bengals won even one of the two games against Pittsburgh, they would have been hosting a playoff game and AFC North champs for the second straight season. Instead, they were disposed on the road at Indy in Round 1. \nWhen talking about Super Bowl contenders in this top-heavy AFC, the path to do much more than earn the first playoff win in 24 years, swings dramatically based on how the Bengals handle Pittsburgh. \nThey have two weeks to prepare for Round 1. \nON TAP TODAY \nBengals go through film review. First of early week practices before the team takes off for the bye week, returning Monday. \nTWITTER QUESTION OF THE DAY Do you think the credibility of this win is slightly \"slanted\" due to Tyrod not playing? @pauldehnerjr — Tim (@YaAlreadyKnowIt) October 18, 2015 \nThanks for the question, Dan. \nFunny how our view of the season changes. Sure, Tyrod Taylor had his moments this year, but what are we really talking about? The Bills weren't missing Jim Kelly circa-1992. The difference between Manuel and Taylor could maybe be a few gutsy runs and the periodic downfield pass. Did you see Bills games this year? With Taylor they scrapped and clawed for 14 points against Tennessee. The Bengals and Bills weren't remotely close Sunday. Even the 34-21 score would be deceiving to a game that was rarely in doubt. \nSPORTS COVER \nGreat photo from our man on the scene Kareem Elgazzar of Gio Bernard smiling on his way to the end zone.
