But according to offensive coordinator Brian Lindgren, that scenario is evolving between junior Jordan Gehrke and redshirt freshman Cade Apsay. \nIn light of the shoulder injury that limited Sefo Liufau during practice — and also helped contribute to his erratic accuracy Saturday against Nicholls in what otherwise has been a hot stretch for the junior starter — the general readiness of the Buffs' backups has become a question of greater importance with the Buffs set to open Pac-12 Conference play Saturday night against Oregon. \nBoth Gehrke and Apsay were able to launch their first pass attempts of the season against Nicholls, and both displayed flashes against an undermanned opponent. Lindgren says their competition for the No. 2 job has been ongoing, with both signal-callers taking reps with the first team while Liufau rested his shoulder. \n\"That's a battle that's really going on since spring football,\" Lindgren said. \"Those guys are both doing a really good job. Right now, we're trying to keep them both as an option.\" \nGehrke, the incumbent backup who logged his first and only career start against Oregon last year, remains listed at No. 2 on CU's official depth chart. He completed just 1 of 4 passes against Nicholls for 3 yards, but he also turned in a 13-yard scramble on third-and-8 that preceded a 59-yard touchdown run by Donovan Lee. Advertisement \n\"If something were to happen (to Liufau), I feel great,\" Gehrke said. \"I've gotten some reps at practice and I feel confident with watching more film against Oregon. Cade really pushes me, but I don't really think about that. I'm just trying to make sure I'm doing the right things and not really worrying about what everyone else is doing.\" \nLindgren said Apsay was given more opportunities to throw the ball in the rout of Nicholls in order to assess the redshirt freshman in his first live-game situation. Apsay responded by going 4 for 6 for 48 yards. \nGehrke led the Buffs to 10 points, while Apsay also directed a touchdown drive. \n\"When Cade came in there I thought he had some nice drives,\" Lindgren said. \"He made some third-down conversions for us and did some nice things. Jordan and Cade both got a lot of reps last week, and it worked out well because Sefo was able to play the first three quarters and those guys were able to get in there and get more reps.\" \nWhile Gehrke didn't separate himself from the pack during his spot start against Oregon last year — he went 9 for 18 for 64 yards in rainy conditions — his 48 career pass attempts gives him a slight experience advantage over Apsay. That gap could narrow by the end of the season. \n\"I feel comfortable with those guys,\" Lindgren said. \"I think the thing Sefo has right now is he has that experience. As much experience as we can give those guys when bullets are flying, I think we'll start to see one guy kind of separate from another. I think right now we want to keep both as options.\" \nPat Rooney: rooneyp@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/prooney07 Colorado backup quarterback Jordan Gehrke runs for a first down against Nicholls on Saturday at Folsom Field.
