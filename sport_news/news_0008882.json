Kendricks tried to return two weeks ago against the Redskins, but he aggravated his hamstring injury and was out after 11 snaps. \nHicks was already playing in the nickel package ahead of Ryans, but the loss of Kendricks forced him once again to play all three downs. But that is essentially how Kelly has billed the Texas product since the Eagles selected him in the third round of the draft. But did he know Hicks was that athletic? \n\"That's what we thought coming out,\" Kelly said Monday. \"I know some people looked at us [and said,] why are we drafting him in the third round? We thought we got a steal in the third round. He was our highest-rated guy for a reason.\" \nEven though he didn't play a single snap on defense in the opener, Hicks is second on the Eagles in tackles (34). He knocked out Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo for his lone sack and has another tackle for loss, one interception, a forced fumble and three fumble recoveries. \nThe 6-foot-1, 236-pound Hicks rolls downhill against the run and has shown that he can get to the quarterback as a pass rusher, but his coverage skills may be what have impressed the most. \nSaints running backs Mark Ingram, Khiry Robinson and C.J. Spiller entered the game Sunday as three of Drew Brees' more reliable receiving options, but they caught only seven passes combined for 11 yards. Hicks played a large role in keeping them in check. \nThe Eagles will face a similar challenge on Monday night against the New York Giants. Running back Shane Vereen (20 catches for 208 yards and a touchdown) has become one of Eli Manning's most dangerous weapons. \n\"They try to get him the ball in space - little angle routes, option routes,\" Hicks said. \nThe Saints tried the same with Ingram, but Hicks often had him blanketed when he was responsible for man-to-man coverage. Brees tried to go to his running back inside the red zone, but Hicks jumped the route and forced him to throw wide and incomplete. \nHicks is as good in zone situations. He once bit on a play-action pass but turned and ran back into his coverage, and along with Ryans he took away a crossing route. Brees pumped, was sacked by Fletcher Cox for a third time, and fumbled. \n\"When you get caught in play-action, we tell them to turn and run . . . and then look back and see what the quarterback is doing,\" Davis said. \"But, [Hicks] was doing it well.\" \nThe play that stood out the most, however, was when Hicks feigned a blitz at the line. Brees turned his head before the snap and the 23-year old dropped deep into coverage. The quarterback tried to fire a pass over Hicks, but the linebacker jumped and nearly snared an interception. \nEagles coaches and Hicks' fellow linebackers have often spoken about his high football I.Q. But his mind matched with sneak-up-on-you athleticism have lowered the first-year learning curve. Hick's 38-inch vertical leap at the NFL combine was tied for fifth among 34 linebackers. \n\"I've always been confident in my abilities,\" Hicks said. \"Obviously, I was anxious to get out there and see what it was like and get a taste of the NFL. Never did I question it. . . . I believe I'm here for a reason.\" \nDavis said the initial plan heading into the season was to ease Hicks in via special teams. He didn't have that luxury after the injuries. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing. \n\"I knew we had a good player, but with rookies, you never know,\" Davis said. \"I've just seen it so many times. Then it's the bright lights and that's always an adjustment. . . . But now he's thrown in he's definitely in the discussion.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:34:09.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
