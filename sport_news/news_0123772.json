Sydney Richwine, and Adaris Ramirez added Pioneer goals before intermission to give the Pioneers an insurmountable 4-0 lead at the half. “(With the big lead) we wanted to pass the ball more and play more possession (in the second half),” Martinez added. “We made a mistake in our end that led to their goal and it was a little wake up call for us.” Lyon scored on an assist from Mallory Copeland, then it was Leslie Ponce’s turn as the Pioneers stretched the lead to 6-1. Ponce added another, Copeland assisted to Amayrani Alvarez for an 8-1 lead. Garcia connected with Lyon to complete the Pioneer scoring and run the final to 9-1. The Pioneers out shot the Tigers 31-8 in evening their GOL record to 1-1. “We were coming off a loss (La Grande) and a tie (Pendleton),” Martinez said. “We were ready to go.” The Pioneers host La Grande Tuesday at 4 p.m. with a chance to avenge their earlier 2-1 loss. “We know what we need to do,” Martinez said. “We feel confident as our field is longer than theirs and they will have to run more.
