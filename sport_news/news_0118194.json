Huntsville 24-26, 25-15, 26-24, 24-26, 15-12. \nThursday \nHuntsville vs. Gravette, 6 p.m. \nChampionship Match \nShiloh Christian vs Berryville, 7:30 p.m. \n\"We have to come in here and not take anything for granted,\" Shiloh Christian coach Nathan Bodenstein said. \"I thought we did a good job of that tonight. I have to hand it to Gravette, they played like they don't care who Shiloh is and gave us a fight. They hustle and get a lot of balls back.\" \nShiloh Christian's Reagan Robinson led the way with 21 kills and 14 digs. The University of Arkansas verbal commit came up big when Gravette made a run in the second game. \nShiloh Christian led only 15-13 with Gravette building momentum when Robinson crushed a kill down the line and added another big kill to make it 17-13 and ignite the run that pulled the Saints away. \n\"Reagan is a special player and she comes up big when we need her,\" Bodenstein said. \"I tell the setters, if there is just a jumbled up mess, set Reagan because probably something good will happen. She stays even keel and doesn't get too upset when things are going bad or too excited when things are going well.\" \nThe Shiloh Christian seniors finished 42-0 in conference play the last three years and the school has won 8 consecutive conference championships. \nAlllie Pitts and Hannah Smithson combined for 30 assists and Pitts had six ace serves. \nGravette (10-7) will play a seeding game for the state tournament on Thursday at 6 p.m. against Huntsville. \n\"The last time we played Shiloh, we just kind of lay down and didn't compete,\" Gravette coach Katie Collins said. \"I thought our effort was much better tonight. We kept fighting and gave it our best shot.\" \nAmanda Pinter had eight kills and Shannon McKnight had five kills. Sarah Isabell had 10 digs for the Lions. \n\"We worked a lot on our blocking to get ready for this game, and I am proud of the way they played,\" Collins said. \"(Robinson) is a great player and is going to get her points, but we tried to make her work for some.\" \nBerryville defeated Huntsville in five sets in the late game that took more than two hours. Berryville will take on Shiloh in the championship match at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. All four teams will advance to the Class 4A state tournament next week in Mena. \nSports on 10/21/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:16:16.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
