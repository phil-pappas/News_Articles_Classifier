The 6-foot-2, 242-pound outside linebacker played this season at Arizona Western College. He is originally from Plainfield, Ill.\nRELATED: 2016 UAB football commitments\n\"First off, the city itself is just an amazing place,\" Garrett said. \"The school is a great institution. I've never had a chance to go to Birmingham before this weekend so I didn't know too much about it.\n\"When I saw what the program had to offer, it was mind-blowing and amazing. Coach (Bill) Clark decided to stay with the team and help these guys and help the city come together, it was amazing. You could feel the energy around the whole team and the coaching staff.\"\nGarrett was the No. 28 overall prospect in the class of 2014 and the nation's no. 2 outside linebacker.\nAnother former LSU player, Maquedius Bain, also committed to UAB this weekend. Pearl River Community College lineman Noah Jones, a JUCO teammate of Bain, also committed .\n\"We've got some pretty good guys that are going to be into this class that haven't been publicized yet,\" Garrett said. \"UAB football is definitely going to be a program that people have to look out for when we come back in the 2017 season.\"\nGarrett played in three games at LSU in 2014 after recovering from shoulder surgery before transferring to Arizona Western. He still had plenty of big schools coming after him, and said that Auburn and Florida State had offered.\nHe just announced his commitment on Sunday night, but he said he's anticipating the question of what made him choose UAB over, say, Auburn and Florida State.\n\"The only thing I'll tell people that when 2017 comes and they see us play our first game, they'll understand why I chose UAB,\" Garrett said. \"There's something special about Birmingham.\"\nUAB hasn't shied away from top prospects in its preparation for a 2017 return to competition. UAB will sign around 15 players in the midyear signing period and have a spring practice in 2016.\nGarrett will be one of them.\n\"(Coach) knew I had other offers,\" Garrett said. \"He told me to come down, just if you don't like it, you don't have to come, but at least come give it a try. I talked it over with my parents and I'm extremely excited and blessed that I took the opportunity to come see Birmingham.\"\nGarrett said he's looking forward to a 2016 year of jelling with his teammates. Clark has said in the past that he's under the impression that players' eligibility clocks won't start or resume until the school returns to competition in 2017.\n\"I'm not sure what it's called,\" Garrett said. \"Coach told me it was going to be called the 'UAB rule.' They're allowing guys to come to UAB's clock to freeze. We're going to have the year off. That clock won't start until we actually play our season. It's going to be academics and workouts. It's going to be huge.\"\nCheck out Garrett's senior high school highlights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:03:58.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
