He was there because manager Terry Francona and the Indians were trying to get his attention. Mission accomplished. \nSalazar, who had a bad spring training, made one start for Columbus before joining the Indians. He has not looked back. In fact, Salazar pitched well enough to be on the mound Sunday when the Indians ended the season with 3-1 victory over Boston at Progressive Field. \nWhen this season started, Salazar owned eight big league wins in parts of two seasons. On Sunday, he won his 14 th game of the season by allowing one run on four hits in 5 1/3 innings. \nSalazar (14-10, 3.45) struck out six and walked one. He threw 66 percent (61-for-92) of his pitches for strikes. Salazar shared the team lead for victories with Carlos Carrasco (14-12). \nThe loss went to Rick Porcello (9-15, 4.92). Porcello, who entered the game with a 9-3 lifetime record against the Tribe, allowed three runs on 10 hits over seven innings. \nCody Allen, the last of four Tribe relievers, pitched the ninth for his 34th save of the season. \nThe Indians took a 3-2 lead with two runs in the third. Michael Martinez doubled to start the inning and went to third on Lonnie Chisenhall's single to left. \nPorcello struck out Carlos Santana, but made an errant pickoff throw to first. When the ball bounced past first baseman Travis Shaw, Martinez scored and Chisenhall went to second. Chisenhall advanced on a ground out by Jose Ramirez and scored on Jesus Aguilar's single to left. \nThe Indians tried to add to the lead in the fifth. Ramirez tried to score from second on Aguilar's two-out single to left. Rusney Castillo, however, cut down Ramirez with a strong throw to the plate. \nBoston took a 1-0 lead in the first on consecutive two-out doubles by Xavier Bogaerts and David Ortiz. The inning ended when Ortiz, with the infield shifted toward first with Shaw batting, tried to steal third. Catcher Roberto Perez led Giovanny Urshela as he was racing back to the bag to get Big Papi. \nThe Indians tied the score, 1-1, in the second with two out. Perez doubled to left and scored on Urshela's bloop single to center. \nWhat it means \nThe Tribe (81-80) posted their third straight winning season. They had a winning record on just three days this season. \nThe Indians have now played winning baseball for three consecutive years for the first time since they posted eight straight winning seasons from 1994 through 2001. The Tribe finished the year 18-15 against the AL East. \nThe Red Sox (78-84) lost the season series to the Tribe, 2-4. They went 15-18 against the Central this year. \nSwitch it up \nFrancona's last lineup of the regular season included five switch hitters – Francisco Lindor, Martinez, Santana, Ramirez and Abraham Almonte. \nStrikeouts are us \nThe Indians ended the season leading the AL in strikeouts with Corey Kluber 245, Carlos Carrasco 216 and Salazar 195 leading the way in the rotation. In the bullpen Cody Allen with 99 and Zach McAllister 84 led the way. \nFor the season the Indians struck out 1,407 batters. \nShrinking ERA \nTribe reliever Jeff Manship pitched two-thirds of an inning Sunday to lower his ERA to 0.92 ERA in 32 appearances. He entered this season with a 6.46 ERA 72 big league games. \nThanks for coming \nThe Indians and Red Sox drew 17,844 fans to Progressive Field for the season finale. They drew 1,388,905 in 78 home dates. \nLast season they drew 1,437,393 fans in 79 home dates. \nThis year's attendance was the smallest in the history of Progressive Field. \nWhat's next?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:32:51.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
