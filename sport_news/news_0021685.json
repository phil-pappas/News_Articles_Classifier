Matt Kenseth might need to, but he's playing it cool Sporting News 1 day ago Ray Slover Â© Jerry Markland/Getty Images Matt Kenseth, driver of the #20 Dollar General Toyota, looks on in the garage area during practice for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Cheez-It 355 at Watkins Glen International on Aug. 8 in Watkins Glen, N.Y. For Matt Kenseth, this is just another work week. Never mind that his status in the Chase for the Sprint Cup hinges on how well he does in Sunday's race at Kansas.\nAdChoices \"We show up and try to do the best we can every week,\" Kenseth said Friday at Kansas Speedway. \"Same this week, obviously a win moves you on, but I don't feel like it's a must win.\"\nMORE: Charlotte race fallout | Dale Earnhardt Jr., retaliation? | Kansas schedule\nYeah, that's a pretty ho-hum reaction from a driver whose Chase hopes were all damaged last week at Charlotte. An early crash left Kenseth 42nd in that race and last in the 12-man Chase field.\nWith one race left in the three-run Chase segment, Kenseth is technically correct. He doesn't have to win at Kansas. But since the final leg of the Contender Round is at Talladega, there is heavy pressure on the bottom four drivers in Chase points at Kansas.\nJoey Logano won at Charlotte to guarantee a place in the final eight. So seven slots remain. A Chase driver who wins at Kansas and Talladega also would advance.\nKenseth was considered a front-runner in the Chase field before Charlotte. He was the fastest qualifier and led 72 laps before pit stop errors knocked him off pace. Then came the capper: A tangle with Ryan Newman led to damage that required pit repairs and cost time. He hit the wall again on Lap 204, and a third and final scrape on Lap 241 ended his day.\nMust-win race? Kenseth sees alternatives.\n\"It would make it easier if we could win,\" he said in Friday's media session. \"Just try to do the best we can today to qualify as good as we can and hopefully start up front and get working on the race tomorrow and hopefully be up front Sunday.\"\nAnother start at the head of the field would be ideal. Passing will again be difficult on the 1.5-mile track at Kansas.\nBefore Charlotte, there was talk of having Kenseth and his three Joe Gibbs Racing teammates in the next leg of the Chase, half the eight-man field. But Kyle Busch found trouble at Charlotte as well, and now he and Kenseth are in the bottom four of the dozen Chase drivers. Carl Edwards and Denny Hamlin are the only ones in good position.\nLogano won last year's race at Kansas, which preceded the Charlotte race; the races were transposed this year.\nRemember, Kevin Harvick faced must-win races last year en route to winning the Sprint Cup, and he did it again this year by dominating at Dover. For Kenseth, there can be no more mistakes.\n\"Since we wrecked, I most likely wasn't clear so I'm sure at the end of the day it was my fault,\" said Kenseth, who admitted he hadn't watched a replay of his bump with Newman. \"Neither Ryan or I, either one of us wanted to be in that position, it hurt both of us. Can't really do anything about last week. Just try to be smarter and if there's a problem, try to fix it with that driver and move on.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-12/nascar-sprint-cup-kansas-hollywood-casino-400-time-tv-channel-schedule-online-streaming-information-pole-qualifying-winner", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658026-nascar-sprint-cup-charlotte-bank-of-america-500-chase-logano-harvick-kenseth-earnhardt-standings-winners-and-losers", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-14/dale-earhardt-jr-junior-carl-edwards-revenge-kansas-chase-sprint-cup-crash"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:45:59.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
