Indy (3-4) still leads the AFC South despite losing its second straight. \nBrees finished 28 of 44 and was helped by a running game led by Mark Ingram, who ran for 143 yards and one score as New Orleans took a 27-0 lead. \nBut Andrew Luck and the Colts wouldn't go away. He threw TD passes of 87 and 46 yards to T.Y. Hilton and an 8-yard TD pass to Donte Moncrief with 3:46 left to make it 27-21. Indy could not recover an onside kick and Brees ran out the clock. \nLuck threw for 333 yards with two interceptions. \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
