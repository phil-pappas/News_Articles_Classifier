LOUIS — Joe Maddon is not a robot. He thinks for himself and is not afraid to say what he thinks.\nThat’s refreshing.\nIt’s his time and his Cubs’ time in the NL Central, a division that has marked the Cardinal Way all these years.\n“Of course we’re ready for some kind of changing of the guard,’’ Maddon said Thursday at Busch Stadium on the eve of the Cubs showdown with the Cardinals in that other NLDS.\n“But I don’t expect the Cardinals to go away,’’ the first-year Cubs manager added.\nThe Cardinals will go away if Maddon’s young Cubs continue to roll. They’ve won nine straight, including the 4-0 win over the Pirates at PNC Park on Wednesday night in the wild-card, win-or-go-home affair.\nNow it’s a five-game series for the Cubs who are more ready than ever with Maddon running the club to perfection his first year in Chicago after four times taking Tampa Bay to the postseason.\n“We’ve played Game 7 already,’’ Maddon said of that victory over Pittsburgh and the melding of his team. “I really have a lot of faith in our guys, I know we’ll be ready.\n“We’ve been playing well all season, but for over a week we’ve been playing really good. I don’t anticipate anything different. No speeches. I don’t get a team together to talk to them.’’\nSo, exactly what is it that Maddon does that is so special?\nGame 1 starter Jon Lester explained.\n“I think the biggest thing is he doesn’t force anything down our throats,’’ the lefty said. “If we have any questions, his door is always open and he gives us truthful, thoughtful answers. You know in this game, we have a lot of guys that feel they don’t want to be truthful for whatever reason. And Joe is not that way. I think the players see that. Management sees that, and it makes it easier to buy into.\n“The other thing is that he backs up what he says. He lets us be us and you don’t run into a lot of problems when you just let guys be themselves.’’\nThat is the perfect description for management success this day and age, don’t be a micromanager in every way.\nIt helps to have players, too.\nFirst baseman Anthony Rizzo is just such a player as are rookies Kyle Schwarber, Kris Bryant and Addison Russell.\nMaddon has made sure his young team is not intimidated here, and Rizzo made it clear this is the perfect place to start a series for the Cubs.\n“This works out well for us because we are so familiar with playing here,’’ Rizzo said. “It’s going to work out better for us as a young team, it’s not like where we are going into a place where we don’t play that team a lot.\n“We know the Cardinals’ style, they know our style. I think it’s good.’’\nThat’s exactly what the Cubs did Wednesday night at PNC behind ace Jake Arrieta.\n“We have different heroes every night. We just sort of expect it,’’ explained Rizzo, who put up 31 home runs, 38 doubles, scored 94 runs, drove in 101 runs and added 78 walks and 17 stolen bases in the regular season.\nThere was the benches-clearing incident Wednesday night, but Rizzo said it was important for the Cubs not to lose their cool.\n“You got the whole country watching that game, you got kids that look up to us watching, you don’t want to get into a brawl and start throwing punches and get suspended,’’ Rizzo said. “We’re setting an example for a lot of people.’’\nThat’s refreshing, too.\nSchwarber hit a monster home run Wednesday, becoming only the third Cubs rookie to homer in the postseason, not that there have been a lot of postseasons.\n“We got really good chemistry here and I can see why we are having the success we are having,’’ Schwarber noted.\nPerhaps Maddon will be the first Cubs manager to win a World Series since Frank Chance in 1908.\nIf he does, Joe Maddon will have done it his own free-thinking way. That’s refreshing.\n  chicago cubs ,  joe maddon ,  st. louis cardinals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:21:48.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
