Why did we do it? The first reason was simple, we knew it would catch people’s attention. But secondly, and more importantly, we wanted to make a point. Most dealers out there always say that they are “different” but at the end of the day are they really doing anything different? At Prime we decided that it was time for change. So we have changed the way we sell cars.\nIt may distracting and it may not look great. But hey, it will get your attention.\nBoston billboards throughout history:\nPrevious -- of -- Next Boston’s WBCN FM radio billboard in 1989.
