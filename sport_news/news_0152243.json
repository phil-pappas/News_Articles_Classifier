He's like a father figure to me.\n\"The other day I saw him for the first time in a long time. We'd never even think about having a little glass of wine or beer (as players) in front of him but the other day someone handed me a glass of wine and I was talking to him (Ferguson) for 20 minutes with the wine hidden behind my back. Me, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes all said the same thing, we all hid the glass of wine behind our back.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:50:13.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
