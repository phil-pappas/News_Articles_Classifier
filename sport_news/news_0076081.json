Chris Samuels, Deseret News Summary \nBYU, Utah and Utah State all face interesting matchups heading into another week of college football. \nWhat kind of teams are going to take down BYU , Utah or Utah State? \nAs it pertains to USU, we won't find out the answer to that question this week because the Aggies will steamroll Fresno State on the road. On the other hand, we will certainly get a glimpse at Rice-Eccles Stadium with Utah facing Cal and star QB Jared Goff. And at LaVell Edwards Stadium, we'll see BYU face the kind of athleticism and playmaking ability that has given the Cougars fits when East Carolina takes the field. \nHaving said that, Utah is a better overall football team than Cal, and BYU’s Tanner Mangum could exploit East Carolina’s secondary if it comes to a shootout. \nSonny Dykes has Cal on the right track, and what he’s doing has to be respected. Goff poses an interesting challenge for the Ute defense. If he’s going to be successful against the Utes , he’ll need more balance from the run to set up his arm. His 15 touchdown passes are impressive and he will produce chunk yardage because of his experienced offense and design. \nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham was able to pinpoint and unload on Oregon and then got a bye week to prepare for a critical showdown with California. This has given him time to fine-tune blitz packages, heal up some wounded players, and refocus his team after climbing into the top five. \nAt times in Whittingham's career, the Utes have focused on a key matchup with a team and then stumbled the following week. That isn’t the case so far in 2015, as things have been set up perfectly with their schedule. \nThe interesting thing about the Cal-Utah matchup is that the Utes face a team capable of scoring big points consistently. If Cal gets a few turnovers to help, it will be game on all night. \nCal’s offense is No. 7 nationally and has amassed 2,639 yards and averages 43.4 points per game. That gets your attention and establishes a “true test” for what the Utes think they have in a remarkable defense, which is actually ranked 32nd. However, Cal is no Fresno. \nIn Provo, the Cougars may get back noseguard Travis Tuiloma and middle linebacker Harvey Langi. They need them. \nIn the Pirates, BYU faces a squad some Cougar fans mistakenly think is just some no-name team from a few time zones away. The opposite is true. East Carolina is a solid program with Power 5 athletes who are hungry and talented. You have to look no further than the UCLA and Michigan backs who ripped off chunks of yardage on the Cougars to picture what could happen. \nThe tender underbelly for the visiting Pirates is their pass defense on the back end. East Carolina’s defense ranks 95th and has yielded 29 points a game. \nThis is a game where BYU needs turnovers and stops on defense and must get out of the rut of settling for field goals instead of touchdowns. This is a game fully capable of getting both teams in the high 30s. BYU’s defense is ranked 79th, but according to Sagarin Ratings, has faced the No. 1 schedule in the nation. \nUtah State can take advantage of so many weaknesses against Fresno. The Bulldogs are just not a good football team. USU has the nation’s No. 13 defense, which is the best in the region along with Boise State. \nUtah State coach Matt Wells won’t say it, but his team almost has a week off. \nCal wins if Dykes gets three Ute turnovers. BYU wins if its defense holds the Pirates under 30. \nThis week’s picks: \nArizona 38, Oregon State 17: Wildcats bigger, faster, deeper. \nOregon 44, Washington State 38: Battle of the defenseless. \nArizona State 34, Colorado 24: Bruin killers on a run. \nOklahoma 45, Texas 14: Longhorns have been corralled. \nBaylor 55, Kansas 21: Bears tired of being dissed. \nNotre Dame 28, Navy 24: Midshipmen face first loss. \nGeorgia 28, Tennessee 24: Bulldogs bounce back from Alabama loss. \nOklahoma 45, West Virginia 24: Sooners flex Big 12 muscle. \nBoise State 44, Colorado State 21: Broncos totally control MWC. \nTCU 48, Kansas State 34: Gary Patterson has things figured out. \nUtah State 38, Fresno State 17: Aggies find comfort zone. \nUtah 32, California 28: Difference for Utes is field position domination. \nBYU 34, East Carolina 28: Return of Cougar defenders helps big time. \nLast week 8-6; Overall 37-16 (.678) \nTWITTER: Harmonwrites Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:39:07.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
