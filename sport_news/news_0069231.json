(Photo: CRAIG RUBADOUX) \nThe Florida Tech football team upset No. 5 Delta State 41-37 in a Gulf South Conference game on Saturday night in Cleveland, Mississippi. \nThe Panthers took the lead toward the end of the first quarter on a Gary Holmes touchdown run and never looked back as they got a big game from the defense. \nWith Delta State trying to tie the game in the fourth quarter, it was the defense that stepped up and made the big plays. \n\"We never seem to make it easy,\" Florida Tech football coach Steve Englehart said on the radio. \nIt is the first conference win of the season for the Panthers, who are now 1-1 in the conference and 2-3 overall. \nAnd they did it on both sides of the field. \nOffensively, the Panthers got Trevor Sand back as the junior ran for 135 yards on 17 carries, while both Holmes and quarterback Mark Cato scored on runs. \nHolmes also made history, becoming the first Tech player to return a kickoff for a touchdown as he took the opening kickoff in the third quarter back 100 yards for a touchdown. \nJosh Denton's fumble recovery for a touchdown gave the Panthers a 40-21 lead with 9:43 left in the third quarter. Delta State would score the next 17 points but the defense held the Statesmen off the scoreboard as Tyler Rosenblatt had a big interception to end the threat. \nAndrew Adair led the defense with 13 tackles, while Leo Alba added 11 and Chris Stapleton had 10. \n\"Our defense was put in some bad situations at the end and I am proud of how they responded,\" Englehart said. \nFlorida Tech will return home Saturday night, hosting West Alabama in a Gulf South Conference game.
