( YHOO - Get Report ) are both declaring victory after the two corporate entities combined Sunday to stream a game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Buffalo Bills played in London. That the game between two of the NFL's weakest teams drew 15.2 million unique viewers was a great success, the league said in a statement, adding that the final number is likely to grow once additional data is collected from China.\"Key here from the NFL's perspective is that we took a game that would have had relatively limited TV viewing in the United States and by distributing it digitally, attracted a larger audience and one which was global,\" the NFL said by e-mail. The Jaguars won the match-up, defeating the Bills 34-31 at Wembley stadium. But can the NFL and a streaming platform such as Yahoo! afford to do this again? And what teams apart from two weak ones, from small markets, would ever agree to forfeit the revenue normally generated from a home game so that the league can work on expanding its brand internationally? Clearly, Jacksonville was willing to make the trip across the Atlantic to play the Bills, assuming that attendance for this game would likely have been light anyway. If a game in Jacksonville is to draw a large crowd, it's probably not with the visiting club from Buffalo. The victory raised Jacksonville's record to 2-5; the Bills dropped to 3-4. Neither of these teams is headed for the playoffs. As for Yahoo!, the beleaguered media technology company, the game provided an opportunity to attract users who might not otherwise come to the site. And that's fine. Yahoo! can write this off as a marketing expense. \nTheStreet's Jim Cramer , Portfolio Manager of the Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio , commented on Yahoo!: \"This was a brilliant move by Yahoo and it showed that the web has managed to become your TV. Marissa Mayer delivered here and the other Internet companies should have bid more aggressively.\" \nExclusive Look Inside: You see Jim Cramer on TV. Now, see where he invests his money and why.

It's unlikely Yahoo! covered that outlay through advertising, said Eric Jackson, founder and managing member of Ironfire Capital and a contributing writer at TheStreet . That the game did suffer from some buffering issues was probably not unexpected even if it did spark some viewer backlash. Yahoo! and the NFL stressed prior to the game that the live stream game would be a trial run. The NFL would clearly like to do more of these, provided it can figure out the economics. In total, the game was streamed 33.6 million times, indicating that some viewers had multiple streams going simultaneously. Most importantly for the NFL, one-third of those streams took place outside of the U.S., an indication that the NFL has room to growth internationally. The streaming numbers don't include television audiences in Jacksonville and Buffalo along with those in London through Sky and the BBC. More streamed games outside the country, or even a team based outside the U.S. -- Canada, the U.K., Mexico? We'll have to wait and see. Yahoo shares were rising 0.5% to $33.35, trimming its 2015 decline to 34%.
