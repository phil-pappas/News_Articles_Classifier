Pretty good for a player listed on the NFL injury report as questionable for the game against the Baltimore Ravens because of an ankle injury.\nDansby was credited with 10 tackles in the Browns' 33-30 overtime victory against their AFC North rival.\nDansby made four stops on Baltimore's final possession of the fourth quarter, including a 1-yard loss on a second-down snap from the Cleveland 4-yard line. After an incompletion, the Ravens kicked a field goal with 25 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime.\n\"Any way we can get it done and get a win in the division, you separate yourself,\" Dansby said . \"So however we had to get it done, we got it done. ... We stood up when we had to. When our backs were against the wall, we stood up and made plays to give our offense an opportunity.\"\nIn his 12 th NFL season, Dansby has been credited with at least seven tackles in each game in 2015.\nDansby was among the 19 former Auburn players who got on the field on the fifth Sunday of the NFL's 2015 season.\nOther former Auburn players who started on Sunday included cornerback Jerraud Powers of the Arizona Cardinals, nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff of the Chicago Bears, defensive tackle Gabe Wright of the Detroit Lions, left guard Ben Grubbs of the Kansas City Chiefs, outside linebacker Corey Lemonier of the San Francisco 49ers and left offensive tackle Greg Robinson of the St. Louis Rams.\nPowers led the Cardinals with 12 tackles, including one on special teams, in their 42-17 victory over the Lions. Powers' tackle total also included a sack, and he knocked down a pass. Wright, a fourth-round draft pick in May, made his first NFL start in the game for Detroit.\nRatliff made his 2015 debut on Sunday. The NFL suspended him for the first three games of the season, and an ankle injury that would have kept him out of the first three games anyway sidelined him last week. Ratliff recorded four tackles in Chicago's 18-17 victory over Kansas City.\nOther former Auburn players seeing action on Sunday included Atlanta Falcons long snapper Josh Harris and safety Robenson Therezie, Lions linebacker Josh Bynes, Jacksonville Jaguars running back Corey Grant and cornerback Nick Marshall, Chiefs outside linebacker Dee Ford, New England Patriots safety Brandon King, Oakland Raiders cornerback Neiko Thorpe, Rams linebacker Daren Bates, defensive tackle Nick Fairley and running back Tre Mason and Tennessee Titans defensive tackle Angelo Blackson.\nGrant returned three kickoffs for 93 yards, including a 42-yarder, for the Jaguars. He also had two rushing attempts for minus-6 yards, losing a fumble on a snap from the Jacksonville 20-yard line with the score tied 24-24 that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers returned for a touchdown on their way to a 38-31 victory.\nKing made his presence known in his first NFL game. Signed off the New England practice squad last week, King recorded two of the Patriots' three special-teams tackles in their 30-6 victory over the Dallas Cowboys.\nMason was limited to 8 yards on two carries as rookie Todd Gurley took over the Rams' ball-carrying duties in a 24-10 loss to Green Bay. Bates made another line leap trying to block a field-goal attempt, but the Packers were able to make it.\nCincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Pat Sims and tight end C.J. Uzomah and Jaguars defensive tackle Sen'Derrick Marks were designated as inactive. Marks is still working toward his comeback after suffering a knee injury in the final game of the 2014 season.\nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE\nThe Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings and New York Jets were on their bye weeks.\nThe fifth week of the NFL season concludes with the Pittsburgh Steelers visiting the San Diego Chargers at 7:30 p.m. CDT Monday.
