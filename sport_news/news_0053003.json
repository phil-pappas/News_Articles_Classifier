Friday night, the Bozeman Bucks did one right after the other, taking a lead early in the second quarter that they didn’t relinquish as they secured a 35-7 win against the Franklin County Seahawks in Class 1A football. In the final seconds of the first quarter, the score knotted 7-7, Seahawk sophomore Rufus Townsend recovered a punt deep in Bucks’ territory to set up the possible go-ahead score. First-and-goal from the 4 for the Seahawks turned into four straight stops by the Bucks’ defensive unit. Bozeman’s offense then maneuvered 99 yards downfield for the go-ahead touchdown. A perfect pass from senior quarterback Logan Foster to senior Zack Mclawhorn covered about two-thirds of that distance. Junior Alex Flowers nailed the second of his five extra points, and Bozeman led 14-7 going into halftime. “They had changed their defense some, it took us a little while to get used to that,” Bozeman coach Lyle Messer said. “After we made the goal-line stand we played pretty well.” Franklin County, 3-4, had struck early, just 19 seconds into the game, when junior David Turney sprinted down the sidelines for a 30-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead following junior Josue Barahona’s extra point. “They’re like us, they’ve been looking for wins,” Messer said. “They got excited when they got the lead and we had to overcome that.” Bozeman, 3-3, fought back with Foster connecting on the first of his two touchdown passes to Mclawhorn on an 18-yard slant pattern. Mclawhorn had seven catches for well over 100 yards receiving. “We settled down and played pretty good from that point on,” Messer said. “It’s the best running attack we’ve had this year.” The Bucks struck within minutes to open the second half on a 6-yard quarterback keeper by Foster. Fierce defensive pressure, led by four sacks on Seahawk senior quarterback Grant Moore by Bucks senior Austin McDowell, gave Franklin County little room to operate. The sacks proved costly to a Seahawk offense that otherwise managed 158 yards rushing. Barahona managed all night to pin the Bucks deep with his strong punting, but the FranklinCounty defense couldn’t keep them there. Bolstered by a 70-yard rushing night by Bucks junior running back Julio Pinero, Bozeman drove steadily throughout the second half, and with 4 minutes left in the third quarter went up 28-7 on Foster’s 25-yard run. Late in the fourth quarter, Bozeman pounced on a Seahawk fumble to regain possession. Foster engineered a 63-yard sprint for the final score.
