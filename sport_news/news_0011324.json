Their country is one of the most repressive nations in the world, according to human rights groups. \nEritrean athletes have previously used sports events to try and escape their homeland. \nIn 2012, 17 Eritrean soccer players and a team doctor went missing during a tournament in Uganda and eventually applied for asylum. The entire team sought refugee status at the same tournament in 2009. \nEritrea was eliminated from 2018 World Cup qualifying by Botswana in this week’s game.
