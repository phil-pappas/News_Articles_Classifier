Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota sponsored the bill and was the only Democrat to support it.\nHeitkamp said the bill would lower or stabilize gas prices, support jobs and increase U.S. influence abroad.\nDespite the largely partisan committee vote, Heitkamp said she is optimistic that some Senate Democrats will support efforts to lift the export ban, which was imposed in the 1970s amid an energy shortage. Heitkamp's bill is expected to be merged with larger legislation sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, before a vote in the full Senate.\n\"Putting an end to (the export ban) is a discussion we need to have by working together, and it shouldn't be a partisan exercise or get bogged down by political poison pills,\" Heitkamp said. \"We have many options to move this policy forward and growing support for it. That's good news for a common-sense, bipartisan policy.\"\nGOP leaders in the House and Senate support lifting the export ban, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee endorsed a bill to do so last month.\nThe White House opposes both bills, saying a decision on whether to end the ban should be made by the executive branch.\n\"Congress should be focusing on meeting America's clean energy needs and our transition to a low-carbon economy,\" said White House spokesman Frank Benenati.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
