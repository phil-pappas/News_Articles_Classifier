The two sides meet on Tuesday in Poland to decide which team qualifies and which advances to the playoffs. A draw would see Poland through. \nNorthern Ireland qualified for the European Championships for the first time in their history with a 3-1 win over Greece on Thursday. \nSteven Davis opened the scoring on 35 minute with a left-footed shot, and Josh Magennis doubled the advantage four minutes after half-time with a header following a corner kick. \nDavis made it 3-0 with a header from the edge of the box just before the hour mark to send Windsor Park into jubilation. \nAlso in Group F, Romania's campaign suffered a setback after a 1-1 draw at home against Finland. \nJoel Pohjanpalo gave the visitors the lead in the 67th minute but Ovidiu Stefan Hoban found an equaliser in stoppage time to end Finland's qualification hopes. \nHungary needed to rally to find a winner at home against the Faroe Islands, winning 2-1 thanks to Daniel Bode's two second-half goals. \nRomania are in second place on 17 points, one ahead of Hungary for the final automatic qualifying spot. \nPortugal completed their qualification from Group I with a 1-0 win over Denmark. \nJoao Moutinho scored in the 67th minute to ensure Portugal will top their group with one game to play. \nDenmark can still qualify automatically should Albania drop points in their final game after they lost 2-0 at home to Serbia as Aleksandar Kolarov and Adem Ljajic both scored in stoppage time. \nThe game featured heightened security after the reverse fixture was abandoned a year ago. \nAlbania must win away to Armenia in their final fixture to qualify and send Denmark to the playoffs. \nEarlier on Thursday in Group D, Georgia defeated Gibraltar 4-0. \nMate Vatsadze scored twice while Tornike Okriashvili added a penalty and Valeri Kazaishvili added a fourth goal late on. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
