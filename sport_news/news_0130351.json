The sides had been at a stalemate, but reached a verbal agreement Wednesday, less than a week before the season opener. \nThe team hopes to make the signing official Thursday. \nAfter Thompson declined to sign a one-year, $6.9 million qualifying offer from the team, it appeared he might be willing to sit out part of the regular season. LeBron James had called Thompson's holdout a \"distraction\" during training camp. \nBut he'll be on the floor as the Cavs try to defend their Eastern Conference title. \nThompson averaged 10.8 rebounds in the playoffs last season. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:43:52.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
