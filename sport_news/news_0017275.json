Braylen has autism. He has a very important job during games. \n\"To be a water boy.\" Said Braylen Hall. \n\"(He's a) water boy, motivational speaker, he's been a little of everything. A doctor, he'll do it all for you.\" Said Head Coach William Bolling. \nBray does all he can on the sideline to lift up his teammates during games, but during one particular game, his teammates were the ones lifting him up. \n\"At three minutes and 56 seconds left in the game, Braylen's dad and I had no idea that was going to happen.\" Said Carrie. \nIt was the last of the regular season for West Whitesburg and head coach William Bolling told Bray to dress in full uniform that night. \n\"My heart just sunk to my stomach.\" Said Carrie. \n\"I just got a touchdown and it was awesome.\" Said Braylen. \n\"It was amazing. There weren't many dry eyes in the crowd.\" Said Carrie. \nThe tears flowed freely in the stands. Even on the sideline Bray's teammates felt the weight of the moment. \n\"It was really good. Me, myself, I almost cried. I was so happy for him.\" Said Bray's teammate and friend Jackson Bolling. \n\"When Bray got on the sideline, everybody was like, 'Good job, Bray!' Someone picked him and everyone went over there and gave him hugs.\" Said Braylen's brother Clayton. \nOn this little league team, the idea of playing for more than yourself is a concept they already understand. \n\"It makes me remember Bray and all the kids that have autism.\" \n\"I think it's going to be life-changing for him. It's definitely going to be a moment that he'll never forget, ever.\" Said Bray's mom Carrie. \nAn unforgettable moment that holds more value than any win on a football field by a boy whose dreams far exceed that 59 yard touchdown run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:16:43.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
