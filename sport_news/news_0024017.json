She is doing it with her play, and she is doing it with her pen. \nAt the beginning of the WNBA Finals, Tamika Catchings presented her Indiana Fever teammates with journals to chronicle the journey. The 11-day, best-of-five series ends Wednesday (8 p.m., ESPN2) with a Game 5 against the Minnesota Lynx, and January's name is all over it. \nIf the Fever win a second championship in four years, January should be the most valuable player. If she is, Catchings will be largely responsible. \nThe two had a heart-to-heart before this series opened. Catchings challenged the point guard to raise her game because \"she can.\" \nShe has. \n\"When she came to me, I mean … just for her to take time out and to have a sit-down conversation with me, 'Yo, I know you can do this,' \" January said. \"To have that support from her meant the world. Coming into this, I wanted to exceed her expectations.\" \nShe has. \nJanuary has led the Fever in points (16.0) and assists (6.0) through four games. She would need a playoff high of nine assists to tie the finals record of 33 — set, coincidentally, by Catchings in 2009. Fever beat Lynx, force winner-take-all Game 5 \nBut those numbers don't quantify her impact. Besides running the offense, she is the team's best on defense. \nCoach Stephanie White has referred to January's \"pace\" — that is, appropriate speed for the Fever to move into sets quickly without rushing. January controlled much of Sunday's Game 4 victory on a night in which she made a single field goal. \nWhite, an assistant to coach Lin Dunn when the Fever beat the Lynx 3-1 in the 2012 finals, said January's play in this series resembles what she did in that one. Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said she remembers more about January's defense from then, and that 2015 has been about her offense. \n\"She slowed down enough to make the right reads,\" White said. \"She slowed down enough to understand how to make her teammates better. We always ask her to be great defensively. When she's great offensively, our team plays at a different level.\" Fever veteran Tamika Catchings is ready for WNBA Finals Game 5. David Woods / IndyStar \nIn all three finals in which January has played — 2009, 2012, 2015 — she has performed significantly better than in the regular season. In 13 such games, her scoring average is 12.6, compared with her career average of 8.8. \nShe and Catchings are the sole holdovers from the team that lost to Phoenix 3-2 in 2009 – when the league last had a five-game finals. The 28-year-old January was a rookie then. She tore her anterior cruciate ligament in 2011 and didn't play a full season as starting point guard until 2012. \nShe has always been one of the WNBA's premier athletes. She high jumped 5 feet, 8 inches to win a Washington state title in high school, and she owns a black belt in karate. \nShe was an All-Star only in 2014 and not part of USA Basketball's national team pool until 2013. Finally, her skills and knowledge have caught up to her speed. She endured Dunn's demanding direction to get here. \n\"Her approach isn't your typical approach,\" January said. \"It's not a lot of love. It's not a lot of hugs and kisses and all that. But I knew she cared about me, and I knew she saw my potential. And she wouldn't let me settle for less. \n\"I respect her. I learned a lot. When I go into coaching, I'm going to carry over a ton of things I saw her do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:37:49.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
