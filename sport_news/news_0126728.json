It seems unlikely UC want to be Louisville now, Paul Daugherty writes. (Photo: Timothy D.

The self-admitted madam told a reporter for ESPN's Outside The Lines that everything she said is true about arranging sex for University of Louisville basketball recruits. \n\"Andre McGee made it rain,\" Powell said, McGee being a former Cardinals graduate assistant, who worked for Rick Pitino. Some 24 would-be working girls showed up 21 times over a four-year span at a basketball dorm named for Pitino's late brother-in-law. They would dance. And do other stuff. According to Powell. \n\"(Do they) wanna make extra money?\" Powell recalled McGee asking her. Powell relayed the question to her dance troupe. In between can-cans, \"eyes lit up,\" she said. The money was not for an extra session of the Ney-Ney. \"The side deals were sex,\" Powell said. \nThere are ways to sell books. And there are ways to sell books. Powell, who seems to have done well selling women's bodies, has a running start on making the best seller lists. \nAt one point during the ESPN interview, Powell even suggested she helped the Louisville program . In her own way. \"I bought them,\" she said. \"Look at what I had to do to get guys here.\" \nPowell claimed the sex cost $500. That's a lot of coin for student-athletes. I mean, these are young men who can't afford a cheeseburger, right? Maybe their Pell Grants covered it. \nThe irony is, Louisville has always been UC's athletic measuring stick. Big brother Lou, the Steelers to the Bengals. Who the Bearcats want to be when they grow up. The Cardinals won the athletic facilities arms race, a 2013 national basketball championship and an invite to the ACC. \nBut does UC want to be Louisville now? \nLet's hope not. \nLouisville's pursuit of athletic excellence has been brazen and unapologetic. This is the institution of higher learning that hired its football coach, Bobby Petrino, for a second run , after Petrino's side shenanigans at Arkansas. Of course, Pitino himself became the victim of extortion for similar alleged doings. \nThere have been any number of winning-is-everything schools over the years. Louisville didn't invent the form. It's just trying to perfect it. \nKatina Powell is disreputable at best. Selling her own daughters? She might make a Brink's load worth of cash with the book, titled \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.\" \nWhat's the sequel? \"Fifty Shades of Red\"? \nPowell might also be counting her swag pile behind bars. And there does remain a canyon between what she writes and says, and what is proven truth. Shooting the messenger won't work this time, though. Too much is out there already, apparently corroborated by several former players who claim to have taken part. \nBeing a woman of letters, Powell kept diligent notes, just for this moment. \"I knew one day they would say, 'She's lying',\" Powell explained. \"I couldn't make this up if I wanted to. I have no reason to lie.\" \nMeantime, it might not be Rick Pitino's fault. It is his problem. \nPitino can't win. If the coach knew about it, he's in deep. If he didn't know about it, he should have. If you believe even some of Powell's story, there is a whole lot of what the NCAA calls \"a lack of institutional control'' going on. \nIt's hard to imagine Pitino knowingly condoning the use of Billy Minardi Hall as a brothel. He was very close to his brother-in-law, who died in the World Trade Center on 9-11. It's equally hard to imagine that a coach as controlling as Pitino would not have at least heard something. Four years and 21 proms. \nAs Powell put it, \"Four years, a boatload of recruits. Dances, alcohol, security cameras, basketball players who came in at will. How could Rick not know?\" \nIt's a tale as old as college sports. The miracle of quasi-am basketball is not Cinderellas and slippers that fit. It is that bad stuff happens all the time, and we never seem to care. We cluck tongues. We laugh, if it involves a rival. We pray it doesn't happen to our team. Madness prevails, in all its forms. \nCollege basketball must be one heckuvan entertainment enterprise, to survive the slime pit in which it occasionally dwells. 63 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1LJb3GA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:38:11.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
