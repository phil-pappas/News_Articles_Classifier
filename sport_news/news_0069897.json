He caught TD passes of 75 and 37 yards for Texas Tech (4-2, 1-2). It was Grant's third 100-plus-yard game this season. \nDeAndre Washington had a receiving and a rushing TD, while Justin Stockton scored on a 54-yard rush. Texas Tech's 776 total yards was a school record. \nThe Red Raiders intercepted Cyclones quarterback Sam Richardson three times — two by J.J. Gaines — and Texas Tech scored touchdowns off two of them. \nWarren said he had a lot of help from other Cyclones (2-3, 1-1). \n\"I give all the credit to the O-line,\" he said. \"Those guys, they showed up real tough.\" \nIowa State quarterback Sam Richardson completed 10 of 21 for 139 yards and three interceptions. He had three coming into the game. \nJoshua Thomas scored two rushing touchdowns for the Cyclones, each from a yard out. \nReceiver Allen Lazard said the loss shook the team. \n\"I think everybody is just very frustrated and disappointed in themselves because they know that we could have played a lot better and that, I mean, we lost to a good team today, but we also didn't play as well as our potential,\" he said. \"Sam just got pressured a lot today, and so he had to speed up his reads.\" \nThe Cyclones play No. 2 TCU next week and No. 3 Baylor the following week. \n\"We've got to stick together,\" Lazard said. \"We can't just hang our heads on this game because these next few weeks we're playing just as good opponents.\" \nThe Red Raider pass offense was the best in the country coming into the game but their receiving corps has thinned due to injuries. Ian Sadler and Devin Lauderdale, who have combined for five TDs and 527 yards, did not play. \nThat gave true freshman Jonathan Giles opportunities he might not have had. He caught a 3-yard touchdown from Mahomes and a 21-yarder from backup Davis Webb who took over for Mahomes in the fourth quarter. Giles' five catches and 59 yards receiving were career-highs. \nMahomes completed 33 of 46 passes with no interceptions. Mahomes was sacked for only the second time this season when he was called for intentional grounding. \nThe Red Raiders hadn't won a game since finishing up their nonconference schedule with a win at Arkansas in September. They then dropped games to then-No. 3 TCU — on a deflected reception in the end zone with 23 seconds remaining — before falling to then-No. 5 Baylor last week. \nTexas Tech scored on its first three possessions and led the whole way. The Red Raiders second touchdown came on the first play of a drive when Mahomes found Grant at the Texas Tech's own 40. Grant cut back to the middle of the field and used at least two blockers to get into the end zone. \nIn the second quarter, Mahomes threw a screen pass on the far sideline to Washington, who cut back to the middle of the field and outran defenders to score. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:23:38.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
