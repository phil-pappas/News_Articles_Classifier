Football was everything. There was no Plan B.\"\nThat book, \"Wake Up Happy,\" which Strahan will be signing Wednesday at Books and Greetings in Northvale, is subtitled \"The Dream Big, Win Big Guide to Transforming Your Life.\"\nAnd, in case you haven't been paying attention, transformation is something the man knows a thing or two about.\nAn Army brat who was born in Texas but did much of his growing up in Mannheim, Germany, Strahan recalls a childhood filled with Smurfs, gummy bears, Bienenstich (\"a beautiful yellow cake confection with caramelized almonds and a butter-cream filling\") and \"Bob,\" the odd-sounding nickname chosen for him by his brothers because of his size.\n\"Bob stands for Booty on Back,\" a sympathetic friend eventually told him. \"They call you that because you're fat.\"\nStrahan's first successful stab at transformation occurred shortly thereafter, with more than a little help from Herschel Walker and Jane Fonda.\nHe purchased the latter's first workout tape and wore it out. \"If Jane said do 20 leg lifts, I did 50,\" he writes.\nThen, once the weight was off, Strahan began building muscle with the help of a book â€” \"Herschel Walker's Basic Training.\"\nA love of football followed, including 15 years with the Giants, a Super Bowl win in his final season and a stint as a Fox football analyst. Throw in a few endorsement deals and a bunch of lucrative public appearances and that's it, right?\nDone!\nIn Strahan's case, however, that was just the beginning.\n<b>Busy man, busy month</b>\nNot yet 44 (his birthday is Nov. 21), Strahan is having a busy October, promoting his book, his clothing line for J.C. Penney and \"Play It Forward,\" the documentary he recently executive-produced. (It's been airing all month on Showtime.)\nStrahan is also a special correspondent for \"Good Morning America\" and, oh yes, the co-host of \"Live! With Kelly and Michael.\"\nSound busy enough for you?\n</div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:47:27.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
