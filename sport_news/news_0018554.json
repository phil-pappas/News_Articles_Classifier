(Gerry Melendez/The State/MCT) × CLEMSON – Dabo Swinney was born into the Alabama-Auburn rivalry, which is why he appreciates what the annual Clemson-South Carolina has become. Swinney, seven years to the day after he took over as Clemson’s head football coach, doubly appreciates the role longtime South Carolina counterpart Steve Spurrier played in growing the Palmetto Bowl. “Alabama-Auburn nationally always had bigger implications. But the rivalry part, shoot, I mean, it’s the same to me,” Swinney said at his Tuesday press conference. “With what Coach Spurrier did at South Carolina, I mean, I guess I’m the fortunate one to be at Clemson during the greatest run in the history of the school. “This isn’t a negative to South Carolina, it’s just a reality. South Carolina’s program, all you gotta do is just look at the history and the facts. They only had one 10-win season in 100-some years before Coach Spurrier. He took them to a level they’ve never been.” As his fifth-ranked Tigers (5-0) prepare to host Boston College in their Homecoming game, Swinney spent three minutes in his opening statement and then the first 18 minutes of the question-and-answer segment fondly recalling his history with Spurrier, which goes back to the head ball coach’s time as Florida’s head coach and Swinney’s days as a player and coach at Alabama. “I actually sacked his punter in the first SEC Championship Game. I think he threw his visor,” Swinney said with a grin. “One thing I’ll say about Coach Spurrier: he’s been consistent his whole career as far as who he is. He’s always been true to himself, and he’s a winner.” The Gamecocks are 42-66-4 all-time against Clemson, but Spurrier leaves South Carolina with a 7-6 mark against Clemson and 5-2 against Swinney. The Gamecocks’ five-game winning streak from 2009-13 is their longest in program history vs. Clemson. But on a national scale, only four of the first 108 meetings between Clemson and South Carolina involved both teams ranked in the top 25. All three clashes from 2011-13 were all-top-25 matchups, and the Gamecocks’ 31-17 win in 2013 was the first all-top-10 showdown. “Now all of a sudden, the national implications of that game changed drastically,” Swinney said. “Certainly with the personality of Coach Spurrier and the success he’s had in his career, I don’t think there’s any question it brought much more of a national audience to this rivalry. Now people are much more aware of it.” Swinney said he got Spurrier’s voicemail Tuesday morning, and Spurrier returned the call for a “great conversation” between the adversaries. “One of the best to ever walk the sidelines,” Swinney said. “I know Coach Spurrier and I, down there he might say something crazy, and then I’ll go back. But we really have a mutual respect for each other.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:21:01.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
