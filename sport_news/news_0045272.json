Exports shrank 3.7 percent, though that was an improvement from the previous month's 13.8 percent decline.\nWeakness in trade has fueled doubts Beijing can hit its economic growth target this year of about 7 percent.\nMuch of China's slowdown over the past five years was self-imposed as the ruling Communist Party tries to steer the economy to more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption instead of exports and investment.
