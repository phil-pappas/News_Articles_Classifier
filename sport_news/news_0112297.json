Mandatory Credit: Candice Ward-USA TODAY Sports The Calgary Flames have altered their goaltending carousel by placing Karri Ramo on waivers Wednesday, according to TSN's Bob McKenzie .\nAdChoices Karri Ramo (CGY) on waivers.\n— Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie) October 21, 2015\nJonas Hiller (1-2-0, 3.71 goals-against average) is expected to receive the bulk of the work with Joni Ortio to serve as the team's backup. The 24-year-old Ortio has yet to make his season debut for the Flames (1-5-0), who are mired in the bottom of the Pacific Division after advancing to the second round of the playoffs in 2014-15.\nCalgary coach Bob Hartley told reporters earlier this week that he was \" sick and tired of the musical chairs\" involving his netminders.\nThree became two with the departure of Ramo, who limped out of the gate with an 0-3-0 mark and 4.37 goals-against average. The 29-year-old Finn yielded four goals on 18 shots before being relieved in a 6-2 setback to the Washington Capitals on Tuesday.\nRamo fared significantly better in his first two seasons in Calgary, notching a 32-24-7 mark with four shutouts in 74 appearances. He owns a 43-48-17 career record with the Tampa Bay Lightning and Flames.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://nhl.nbcsports.com/2015/10/19/flames-sick-and-tired-of-the-musical-chairs-in-net-says-hartley/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/TSNBobMcKenzie/status/656863145722560512", "http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=784199&navid=nhl:topheads"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:11:52.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
