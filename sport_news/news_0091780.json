Jack Brendamour was a Cincinnati businessman and commercial real estate developer. He passed away Oct. 2. at 88.

Jack Brendamour's career. \nIn the 1960s and 70s, Mr. Brendamour helped expand a sporting goods store from a single store into a 14-store chain. In the 1960s, he was part of an eight-man steering committee that helped bring the Bengals to Cincinnati. And in the 1970s, he helped build the 60,000-square-foot Hyde Park Executive Building. \n\"I grew up thinking everyone's parents go out three or four nights a week,\" said his son Michael Brendamour. \"He was always doing something.\" \nThat is evident from Mr. Brendamour's many accomplishments. The Kenwood and Indian Hill-resident was also an avid shooter and golfer, and a family man. He was married to his wife, Mary Lou, for nearly 58 years and had three sons, Michael, Douglas and David. \nMr. Brendamour died Oct. 2. He was 88. \nBorn April 2, 1927 in Cincinnati, Mr. Brendamour went on to attend Hyde Park Elementary School and Withrow High School. \nAfter graduating high school in 1945, Mr. Brendamour joined the United States Navy during World War II. He served on the the destroyer USS Hopewell in the Pacific and was honorably discharged in 1946. \nAfter returning home, Mr. Brendamour enrolled at the University of Cincinnati. There, at a Sunday tea mixer that included Kappa Delta sorority members and Beta Theta Phi fraternity members, Mr. Brendamour met Mary Lou Price. The couple dated for two years and married in 1949. The ceremony in Oak Harbor, Ohio included many of the same sorority sisters and fraternity brothers that were at that first mixer. \nE. Jack Brendamour is pictured on the front of a retail merchandising magazine. (Photo: Provided) \nMr. Brendamour graduated that same year from the University of Cincinnati with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. After graduation, he began working full-time at his family's sporting goods store, the former Brendamour Sporting Goods. \nMr. Brendamour was president of the company from 1960 to 1972. He and his wife helped grow the company from a single-store operation to a 14-store chain in three different states. \n\"As a young man, that was a pretty good achievement,\" Michael said. \nDuring the 1960s, Mr. Brendamour was selected to be part of an eight-person steering committee that helped attract the Cincinnati Bengals to the city. The committee also included Ohio Gov. James Rhodes and two Cincinnati mayors. \n\"Dad wasn't picked because he was this successful, wealthy person in Cincinnati,\" Michael said. \"They wanted someone who understood retail.\" \nMr. Brendamour was also a successful real estate developer. He received his commerical real estate license in 1972, and obtained his brokerage license in 1976. He later opened the Brendamour Group Commercial/Industrial Realtors. He was president of the Cincinnati Area Board of Realtors in 1987, and was named Realtor of the Year in 1990. \nHe was partially responsible for many well-known projects around town. He helped the Hyde Park Executive Building, a 60,000-square-foot commercial office complex in Hyde Park. And in 1977, he helped move 16 houses and an apartment building from Edwards Road and Madison Avenue to Mount Vernon Avenue. A new subdivision was built out of the old homes instead of tearing them down. \nMr. Brendamour was known for his fun, upbeat demeanor. A photo of him moving the homes to Mount Vernon shows him standing in one of the homes, which was cut in half, as a truck carries it across town. \nE. Jack Brendamour is pictured inside one of 16 homes that were moved from Edwards Road and Madison Avenue to Mt. Vernon Avenue to build a new subdivision of old homes. (Photo: Provided) \n\"He was liked by a lot of people,\" Michael said. \nIn fact, he was liked so much that it was hard to keep his attention sometimes. When Michael and his brothers were younger, they always wanted to stay in and have parties at their house. \"If we went out, we would lose his attention,\" Michael said. \"He would be talking to someone.\" \nThe family would take regular vacations every year – one to Florida and another to a destination of Mr. Brendamour's choosing. During many of those trips, David remembers his father running into someone that he knew. It could be in California or New York; Mr. Brendamour would always remember the person's name. \nMr. Brendamour is survived by his sons, eleven grandchildren and three great grandchildren. \nA celebration of life will be held Oct. 24 from 9:30 a.m. to noon at the Horizon Community Church, 3950 Newtown Road, Anderson Township. \nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests donations made to City Gospel Mission of Cincinnati, Horizon Community Church or Habitat for Humanity. \nFor consideration in Lives Remembered, please send information and contact number to livesremembered@enquirer.com 23 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1LxXNEz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:48:27.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
