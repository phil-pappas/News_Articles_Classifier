Always try to be better, always give 10 metres more, because that will be the key to success. \n\"He seems to be a very open manager and someone that likes to be close to the players, but very straight as well. That's what I've learned from the last couple of days and I think it was a positive way to start.\" \nUnder Klopp, Borussia Dortmund were known for their uptempo pressing style of football, and Lucas is confident it is a philosophy that will translate well on Merseyside. \n\"He was so successful at his last club,\" he continued. \"Of course, when a manager like him comes it always gives you a lot of hope. \n\"It's a fresh start for every player. His CV is amazing. So I think everyone is really excited to learn with him and improve as a player and a team, because that's the only way we will achieve what we want.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:11:34.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
