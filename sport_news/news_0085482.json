Dakota Bolte took it to the end zone on a 40-yard run, the first of four touchdowns for the junior running back. The Hornets (5-1, 5-0 in Tri-County League) remained perfect in league play with a 46-6 over Dean Tech (0-6, 0-6) Friday night at Holyoke High School. \nMcCann scored 16 points in each of the first two quarters and by the time Dean got on the board, the Hornets had put 46 points up. \nLast week, McCann had suffered its first loss of the season, but LeClair said it wasn't tough to shake off. \n\"It was a great experience last week. They got to see things they don't usually see in the Tri-County League,\" he said. \nDean Tech saw something right off the bat that they might not see much of — a long run by Bolte. \nLeClair called the play, a \"28 pitch,\" and Bolte cut back against the grain for a 40-yard TD run. \nBolte only carried the ball nine times in the game but scored on four of those running plays. He had runs of two and 62 yards in the second quarter and six yards in the fourth. When the evening was over, he had nine carries for 163 yards. \n\"It's great to see his development over the years,\" said LeClair. \"At the beginning of this year he was going to be a wide receiver.\" Advertisement \nBolte stepped in when Eathan Heller injured a knee in a preseason scrimmage. \nBolte was not, however, the only Hornet to have a big game. Running back Adam Dufur only had four carries, but scored on two of them, and gained 86 yards. Dufur scored on runs of 40 and 30 yards. \nQuarterback Mike Ferrara didn't have to do anything in the air, throwing one incompletion. He ran the ball once for 17 yards and Corbin Richardson had one carry for four yards. \nFranklin Tech beat Ware 35-21, and are unbeaten in the Tri-County League. Franklin Tech and McCann will see each other next Friday in Greenfield. \n———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:47:01.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
