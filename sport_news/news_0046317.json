Paire beat Marcos Baghdatis 6-3, 2-6, 7-5. \nBoth Nishikori and Wawrinka had the day off after booking their places in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:05:32.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
