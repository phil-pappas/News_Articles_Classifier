He was voted the NFL offensive rookie of the year that season and has since gone to three Pro Bowls. He's passed for 4,000 yards in each of his last four seasons.\nHis talent is evident.\nBut, like Romo, it's been regular-season talent. He hasn't been the same quarterback in January that he has been from September through December.\nRyan has won 61 percent of his career starts and taken the Falcons to the playoffs four times in his seven seasons. He has a cool nickname -- Matty Ice -- and twice has delivered the Falcons the top seed in the NFC with 13-3 records in both 2010 and 2012. But Ryan failed to win a playoff game in his first three postseasons.\nRyan finally won in 2012, passing for 250 yards and three touchdowns in a 30-28 victory over Seattle in the NFC semifinals. That moved the Falcons within one game of the Super Bowl with the NFC title game in Atlanta. But the San Francisco 49ers pulled off a 28-24 upset despite 396 yards passing and three touchdowns by Ryan. He's now 1-4 in his playoff career.\nRomo has quarterbacked the Cowboys to the playoffs four times in his nine seasons. He also delivered a top seed in the NFC bracket in 2007 with a 13-3 record. But the Cowboys lost in the NFC semifinals that postseason. Romo didn't win a playoff game until his third postseason and has never taken the Cowboys to an NFC title game. He's 2-4 in his playoff career.\nQuarterbacks are measured by championships. Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman -- you carve your historical niche and claim your bust in Canton with Lombardi Trophies. You need a ring to give your career legitimacy.\nAsk Steve Young. He lost a pair of NFC title games to the Cowboys in the 1990s before finally escaping the Cowboys in 1994 and going on to win his first Super Bowl. He now has a bust in Canton.\n\"Understand that the Super Bowl is a team thing,\" Young said. \"But without it, you don't have that exclamation point for whatever kind of career you've had. Super Bowls define it. You can say, 'Aw, that's not right. That's not the way you should look at it.' You can say whatever you want -- but those are the facts. The perception is that Super Bowls are what define players.\"\nWhen the Falcons drafted Ryan, they envisioned championships. That's also the reason the Falcons gave him a new $103 million contract in 2013. Ryan hasn't been able to deliver a playoff berth since signing that contract.\nBut the Falcons are looking for their first 3-0 start since 2012 when they roll into AT&T Stadium Sunday. Ryan has been a big part of that success with his 661 passing yards this season. Only Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisberger have thrown for more. Ryan is 30 now. He knows what needs to be done.\n\"Super Bowls define us,\" Young said. \"You can spend the rest of your career playing terrific football, even MVP football. But it won't do what a Super Bowl does.\"\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges.\nMORE COWBOYS OPINION, ANALYSIS\nMoore: How many wins Cowboys need in next 8 games to claim NFC East and how they can get 'em\nUpon Further Review: In wake of Romo injury, re-thinking season predictions ... plus Sunday picks vs. Falcons\nSherrington: Trading for Matt Cassel more proof Cowboys are all in for 2015; will he eventually beat out Weeden?\nPhilly columnist: Eagles' loss to Cowboys 'a sheer nightmare;' DeMarco Murray bears least blame\nGosselin: Falcons have their own version of Tony Romo, complete with playoff failures\nWHAT PLAYERS, COACHES SAY Cole Beasley on running the 'same offense' with Brandon Weeden, and his advice on getting rid of spiders\nRon Leary doesn't plan on splitting time Sunday against Atlanta\nChip Kelly 'embarrassed' by Eagles' performance against Cowboys\nNate Newton: What I liked and didn't like about game vs. Eagles\nCowboys DE Jeremy Mincey responds to Eagles WR saying coaches called out play-calls: 'It might have felt like that'\nJerry Jones: 'Good chance' Cowboys defense can carry the load until Bryant, Romo get back\nCowboys' Jerry Jones would love to show he can win in 'fourth quarter' of his life\nJerry Jones: Our starter is Brandon Weeden, and 'you won't see a more gifted passer'\nDez replacement?
