Soccer purists would beg to differ. \nWhen the Girls in Maroon are knocking around the ball—especially in the late stages of a match—it’s done with precision and master strokes. This approach can drive opponents batty when they chase the ball in vain. That a supposedly unimaginative style is know worldwide as tiki-taka—made popular by the Spanish National Team and other Spanish domestic sides. \nThose short passes and quick movement of players shifting in concert only enhances the skills of Clifton’s veteran roster. \nOnce Clifton gets the lead this season there’s been little opportunity to catch them. \n\"We stress ball movement and play a clinical game,\" senior Kelly Aguilar-Almazo said. \"The midfield plays tiki-taka, the defense is solid and doesn’t let up goals and the forwards read the game well and keep the ball moving. We are playing with a spirit.\" \nIndeed the Mustangs are doing so and last Saturday’s 2-0 blanking of Pompton Lakes in the quarterfinals of the Passaic County Coaches’ Association Tournament at Clifton School Stadium was the validation. \nMeaghan Mancini and Brittany Morales struck from distance and senior goalkeeper Carly Egyed pitched her second clean sheet over a four-match span. \n\"Those were beautiful goals,\" Clifton boss Konrad Kruczek said. \"And what can you say about Carly [Egyed] but she’s playing well.\" \nIn spite of a dominating opening 20 minutes, the Mustangs were still goalless. Yet no panic set in. Clifton sat back and waited for the seventh-seeded Cardinals to crack. \nFinally a goal arrived on 21 minutes compliments of Morales. The senior central midfield has an educated right foot and there was little doubt after she struck a direct kick from 25 yards that swerved into the upper corner and out of the reach of Pompton Lakes ‘keeper Daniella Lucca. \nAguilar-Almazo had a clear view of Morales’ seventh goal, \"it knuckled when she hit it; the goalie had no chance [to save it].\" \nThe No. 2 Mustangs were back in business and Pompton continued to press hard and chase the ball to no avail. That’s when Mancini pulled a shocker that Lucca never saw. \nMancini, who is becoming the county’s most prolific goal-scorer as an underclassman, received the ball in the center of the field and after a few touches send a 35-yard screamer directly into the sun that seemed to have blinded the keeper. It flew past her before gently nestling into the netting only eight minutes after the interval. \n\"Pompton [Lakes] never stopped fighting; they played hard and with heart to the final whistle,\" senior Olivia DeMuro said. \nWith Clifton, the back four has been a steady influence on the game but an exciting component came aboard this season. \nMaria Orozco is one of North Jersey’s premier freshman strikers. Orozco features pace and flair having learned the game while growing up in Medellin, Colombia. The rail-thin threat can break down a defender with deft moves but gains satisfaction as the set-up person. \n\"Playing in Colombia it was about individual play and here in the United States it’s more team oriented,\" said Orozco, who arrived in Clifton two years ago. \"I play direct and like passing and connecting with Meaghan [Mancini] and Brittany [Morales]. We work well together.\" \nEven Kruczek knows that Orozco can be a game-changer. \n\"Since 15 years old, Maria is one of the most technically skilled players in the county. Once she possesses the ball it’s hard to take it away from her. The fact that she’s starting for a very good team says a lot about her talent level,\" he said. \nAfter dispatching the Cardinals, next up is third-seeded Lakeland on Saturday in the county semifinals at Wayne Valley, 2 p.m. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:26:29.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
