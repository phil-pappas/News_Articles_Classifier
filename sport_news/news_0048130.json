THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes Article Argos coach faces tough decision at receiver MONTREAL - \nRicky Ray hasn’t taken a snap since Toronto’s visit to Montreal in the penultimate game last season. \nIt proved to be a crushing occasion for both Ray, a three-time Grey Cup champion, and the Argos. He suffered concussion and the Argos would lose control of their destiny before post-season elimination arrived the following weekend. \nRay, who also underwent off-season shoulder surgery, has shown signs of improvement and head coach Scott Milanovich would acknowledge on the eve of Toronto’s Thanksgiving date with the host Als that his future hall of famer is nearing a return. \n“He’s closer,’’ Milanovich said on Sunday. “He made a jump last week, I thought. If something happened to Trevor (Harris), Ricky will probably take a shot at it. \n“And that hasn’t been the case the last couple of weeks. We’d like him (Ray) to make the same jump like he made last week one more time and I think he’d be back. But he’s not quite there, yet.” \nRay’s return is going happen sooner rather than later, giving the Argos quarterback options and the league’s most accurate passer. \nHarris has clearly earned the right to be the man, but one slip-up, one errant ball that leads to a loss and the door gets opened for Ray. \nBoth are free agents and the Argos likely to lose one next season. \nHarris deserves to be the starter, even when Ray is completely ready to go, but at the same time, he needs to be more accurate and fundamentally sounder in his mechanics. And that’s the thing about Ray, who seldom throws a bad ball. \nIn Montreal late last season, John Bowman came off the edge to deliver the blow to Ray. Two years ago, the QB hurt his knee in Montreal. \nHarris has been durable for the Argos, Monday’s start representing his 14th in a row, dating back to last season’s finale when Ottawa came to Toronto. \n“I’ve said all year, as long as Trevor continues to play well he’s going to play,’’ said Milanovich. “I see no reason to change, but he’s got to continue to play well.” \nLate-game drives for scores, getting receivers involved, making plays with his feet, Harris has shown a lot, but he needs to summon more at this time of the season, when the regular schedule is winding down and the spotlight intensifies on the CFL’s quarterbacks. \nThe Argos found a way to win in Ottawa for the second time last week, even though they lost the turnover ratio with Harris being intercepted twice. Harris needs to be clean and he needs to improve on his accuracy. Tipped balls, issues with his footwork, there have been a variety of reasons why he has thrown interceptions. \n“When he gets into trouble it’s usually not decision-making. It’s the accuracy of the ball being off six inches on a crossing route and, if it isn’t caught, it ends up being picked off,’’ added Milanovich. “We’ll continue to push Trevor to be perfect.” \nHaving Ray as a fall-back gives the Argos a leg up or, in this case, an arm up in the East. Harris isn’t one to look over his shoulder, but Ray is getting closer and it remains to be seen how the veteran complements the team’s new receivers. \n“He looks fairly normal,’’ said Milanovich of Ray. “I’d say he can throw it 45 yards now. It (his surgically repaired shoulder) has been feeling better. He’s had soreness all year. But at one point last week, he told me it’s as good as it felt last year. He still had pain, but I think it’s starting to go away.” \nBIGGEST OF STAGES \nThere are big games and then comes a stage that appears to be bigger than most — which neatly sums up the Alouettes and their plight heading into Monday afternoon’s tilt gainst the Argos. \nIt’s not exactly do or die because Montreal, regardless of the outcome, still has games to play, but a loss could prove devastating for a franchise that has never missed the post-season since the CFL returned to the city in 1996. \nChanges have come to characterize the 2015 season for the Als, who have once again turned to GM Jim Popp to serve as head coach following the release of Tom Higgins. \nBetween co-ordinators and players coming and going and back-to-back losses on the road within a five-day span, it’s been one of those seasons to forget, one that could go completely off the rails if Montreal doesn’t turn its season around. \nIt starts on Monday, the Als coming off a bye break, presumably well-rested and better prepared to bounce back from an embarrassing loss in Saskatchewan when the Riders had won all of one game, and a beatdown in Ottawa when veteran Henry Burris lit up their vaunted defence. \n“It’s big,’’ said Popp on Sunday during an availability about the importance of Monday’s matinee. “Each week goes by and there’s less games to win to get into the playoff race. They are all important from the very first week and I’ve always told our players, even when I’m speaking to them in training camp. \n“It’s not just a buildup towards the end of the year playing better football. Each game matters whether you win a lot late or early, it’s the total number of wins you have to get you into that playoff race. When you start running out of games you back yourself into a corner and they become must-wins. It’s an extremely important situation for us to even get into the playoffs.” \nThe Als and Argos haven’t played since the pre-season with Monday’s meeting the first of two in a 12-day period. \nFor the Als, there are home games remaining against Hamilton, a team they have beaten twice already this season, and Saskatchewan, with road games in Toronto and Edmonton. \nAt 5-8, it seems the best shot Montreal has to keep its post-season streak intact involves a crossover. \nSeveral Als players are aware of the tradition the franchise has established, but many are new. \n“I heard one young man talking about how he’s been following our team since we returned and he was 12 years old,’’ said Popp. “I’m sitting there saying: ‘Wow.’ Here’s a player playing for us, but he was 12 when I actually started working here going through this.” \nWith five games left, there’s always a chance, but for the Als the margin for error becomes smaller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:17:12.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
