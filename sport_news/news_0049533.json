The contract is a combination of what now are two separate contracts. One is held by the nonprofit Mount Rushmore Society for parking and the other is held by the for-profit Xanterra Parks & Resorts for food, beverages and retail. A Park Service prospectus says the two groups' receipts last year totaled more than $16 million. If Xanterra doesn't bid for the single contract and win it, the successful bidder will have to pay $5.6 million to the company for the value of its investments in buildings, fixtures and other property at the memorial. Proposals are due Jan. 13, 2016. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
