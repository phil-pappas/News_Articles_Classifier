Detectives believe that the sames bandits robbed the Chevron at 3040 Headland Dr., the Texaco at 608 14th St. and the Exxon at 1521 Peachtree St., Jones said.\nAtlanta police believe this man and his cohorts are responsible for three robberies this week. (Surveillance) Anyone with information is urged to contact the investigating detective at 404-546-2498 or email mbuckley@atlantaga.gov, Jones said. They are eligible for a reward up to $2,000 if the tip leads to a conviction.\nAny information on the case can be submitted anonymously to the Crime Stoppers Atlanta tip line at 404-577-TIPS (8477), online at www.crimestoppersatlanta.org or by texting CSA and the tip to CRIMES (274637).\nPolice hope that this man is still recognizable despite the head covering. (Surveillance) Atlanta police need help identifying this young man, who is wanted for three robberies this week. (Surveillance) Police hope that these shoes might help someone recognize the partially obscured faces of the gas station robbery suspects.
