Jay Beagle pulled Washington even at 5:42 of the third, and Ovechkin won it with his fifth goal of the season -- all in the past five games. Vancouver lost its third straight to fall to 3-2-2. Wild 3, Blue Jackets 2: Thomas Vanek broke a tie in the second period and Minnesota spoiled Columbus coach John Tortorella's debut. Columbus' 0-8-0 start is the worst season-opening regulation losing streak in the NHL since the New York Rangers started 0-11-0 in 1943-44. Tortorella took over as coach Wednesday after Todd Richards was fired. Predators 5, Ducks 1: Colin Wilson and Ryan Ellis each had a goal and two assists and Pekka Rinne made 27 saves to lift Nashville past Anaheim, which has lost five of six this season. Stars 4, Penguins 1: Jason Spezza scored his fifth goal of the season and Dallas beat Pittsburgh for its fifth straight victory. Rangers 4, Coyotes 1: Henrik Lundqvist made 34 saves and Kevin Hayes broke a tie early in the third period in New York's victory over Arizona. Blackhawks 3, Panthers 2: Patrick Kane and Brent Seabrook each had a goal and two assists and Chicago beat Florida in its first game since top defenseman Duncan Keith had surgery in his right knee. Advertisement Devils 5, Senators 4: Lee Stempniak tied it with 32 seconds left in regulation and added the shootout winner in New Jersey's victory over Ottawa. -- ASSOCIATED PRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:18:45.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
