The big winner of the night, though, was David Lucas. \nIn between the second and third sets, Lucas asked Elmira senior volleyball player Ashley Heiman to marry him, with an estimated crowd of 225 fans watching. Heiman, a native of Dansville who attended Wayland-Cohocton High School, said \"yes\" as her parents, Anne and Michael Heiman, watched from the stands. \nAccording to a press release from the college, Lucas traveled to Elmira from Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, Texas, for the surprise proposal. \nHeiman's night also included a match-high 10 kills as Elmira won 25-17, 26-24, 25-16 to improve to 13-8. Sami Hanes added 24 setter assists for Elmira and Amanda Blinkinsop contributed 15 digs. \nCazenovia dropped to 4-14. \nElmira hosts the Elmira College Invitational on Friday and Saturday. \nOn Twitter: @SGAndrewLegare Read or Share this story: http://stargaz.tt/1LwxoXT TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:38:55.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
