Two seasons ago, Holiday lost nearly half a season to a stress fracture in his right leg. The following year, Holiday logged starter's minutes for months without fully giving his leg time to strengthen and acclimate. By January he had aggravated that same stress injury, sidelining him for three months and limiting him in New Orleans' first-round playoff series against Golden State. Between those two trying seasons, Holiday logged 74 total regular-season games—a dispiriting mark for an All-Star guard tabbed to run the offense of an up-and-coming Pelicans team.\nThis time around, Holiday and the Pelicans will proceed with caution. Holiday was limited in training camp; he didn't strain his leg with the full run of two-a-day practices and was pulled out of certain drills to work on an alternative regimen. When not putting in his own, separate work, Holiday made a point to be present by participating as he could or shouting words of encouragement. Every indication is that he will play as much as allowed—not by his pain threshold or internal assessment of his own injury, but as is outlined by medical professionals with an eye to the big picture. We caught up with Holiday to discuss his recovery, what it means for his season, and how the Pelicans are shaping up under a new coaching staff.\nSI.com: There's been some news over the few weeks about you having a minutes restriction for next season. What's your understanding of where that is and how much you'll be playing to start the year?\nHoliday: \"I think it'll be 10-15 minutes just so we don't have the same thing that happened last year where I started off playing 35 minutes and something else happened to my leg and don't know why. So I think we're just going to take it slow and through every game, after every game, during every practice, see how it's feeling and we'll just go from there.\"\nSI.com: How does that conversation go?
