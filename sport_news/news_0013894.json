He is 1-3 as a starting quarterback heading into Saturday's home game against New Mexico (4-3, 2-1, Mountain West). \n\"I just felt whoever you put back there, they won't surpass what he did,\" Caragher said. \nThe old football saw says a quarterback often gets too much credit or blame depending on the outcome. \nIt's clear the Spartans (3-4, 2-2) took a leap backward against San Diego State. The coach pointed to mistakes across the field, including Potter's two errant throws that led to 10 points for the Aztecs. \nBut Caragher also saw Potter handle San Diego State's pressure with assurance. \n\"He played a really solid game,\" Caragher said. \"In the face of that pressure, Kenny kept his form, he stayed in the pocket and stayed composed and made some plays through the rest of the game.\" \nPotter, a transfer from Long Beach City College, has completed 72 of 110 passes for 733 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions this season. \n-- Potter and his blockers can expect a lot more pressure at Spartan Stadium come Saturday. Advertisement \nBlitzing New Mexico has recorded 20 sacks this year, led by linebackers Maurice Daniels (4.5) and Dakota Cox (3.5). \nBring it on. \n\"Sometimes we welcome pressure,\" Caragher said. \"When there is pressure there is always an answer to exploit the defense with that.\" \nThe coach also acknowledged the players have to take advantage of six-on-five situations. \n\"In the last two games we had some of those moments and we have to be able to respond,\" he said. \nIf San Jose State's offense keeps its composure, it could burn the New Mexico defense. The Lobos have created 14 turnovers this season -- seven interceptions and seven fumble recoveries -- but allow 27.5 points per game. -- The Spartans know they let a big opportunity to compete for the West division title slip away against San Diego State. \n\"There was a lot there and the team felt it,\" Caragher said. \"There was just a tough feel of the air being let out of the balloon.\" \nBut the coach expects a big response this weekend. 'I've seen it all year: this team has recovered,\" he said. \"I am planning on bouncing back.\" -- Jimmy Pruitt remains sidelined with concussion-like symptoms, but the senior cornerback is listed in the depth chart for the game against New Mexico. Caragher said Pruitt is close to returning. Contact Elliott Almond at 408-920-5865.
