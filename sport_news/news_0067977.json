(AP) - Kansas is the preseason pick to win its 12th consecutive Big 12 title.\nAll-American forward Perry Ellis opted to return for his senior season, and he'll be joined by talented guards Wayne Selden, Frank Mason and Devonte Graham, all players who logged crucial minutes as the Jayhawks rolled to another conference championship last season.\nBut there is plenty of talent around the league. Oklahoma returns All-American guard Buddy Hield, who may have been a first-round pick had he declared for the draft after last season. He'll be joined by fellow seniors Isaiah Cousins and Ryan Spangler, who also started all 35 games for Oklahoma a year ago.\nIowa State may have a new coach in Steve Prohm, but Georges Niang, Jameel McKay and Naz Long are seniors with high expectations.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
