But even when the NV/Old Tappan senior All-America selection doesn’t touch the ball, he has an effect on the play because the mere threat of him influences coverages. \n“There’s more to that team than just him. A lot more,” said Pascack Valley senior wide receiver Mike Pimpinella. “But when there is one guy as great and talented as him, you have to account for him.” \nBut what about on defense? \nThe speedy Fuller can be just as big a game-changer at defensive back, even though there are not eye-popping statistics to back that up. \nIn fact, Fuller’s defensive skills could be a huge difference-maker tonight when the Golden Knights (5-0), No. 1 in The Record public Top 20, face No. 2 Pascack Valley (5-0) in Hillsdale in one of the biggest games of the season. \nThat makes this one of those games that could go a long way toward defining Fuller’s place in the parade of top-shelf Division I talent that has made its way through North Jersey over the past decade. \n“I’ve definitely got to prove myself every week,” said Fuller, whose final list of scholarship choices include Rutgers, UCLA, Notre Dame, TCU, Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State and Virginia Tech. “You know people are looking at you, so have to bring your ‘A’ game every week. But that’s fun.” \nThe 6-foot-2, 200-pound Fuller has 11 tackles and one interception in five games. Consider, however, that teams routinely do not throw the ball in his direction. And also consider that the NV/Old Tappan defense – one of the best in North Jersey – hasn’t been on the field much in second halves of some blowout games. \n“I think I’ve been playing well,” Fuller said. “I haven’t had that many missed tackles. Last year, I had quite a few against [Pascack Valley], and I’ve worked hard on that.” \nFuller could be part of the most intriguing matchup of tonight’s game if he is assigned to cover Pimpinella, one of the hottest wide receivers in North Jersey. The 6-foot, 190-pound Pimpinella is quick and daring, catching 12 passes for 380 yards and six touchdowns in the past two games. \n“He has the most catches of any receiver we’ve faced,” Fuller said. “He runs great routes and knows how to find open spots. That’s the most important thing.” \nThe Indians regularly use two running backs and a tight end in formation, and the Golden Knights haven’t seen that sort of offense this season. PV’s running backs are solid, but Pimpinella definitely has been its game-breaker. \nWhen it comes to the game within the game – Fuller vs. Pimpinella, perhaps on both sides of the ball – it promises to be good theater. \n“He’s obviously an exciting and talented football player, but one person doesn’t win a football game,” Pimpinella said. “We have to throw his way. I’m not saying we’re going to do it every play, but we have to challenge him.” \nFuller stepped up big time last month in NV/OT’s 32-28 victory over Ramapo, rushing for 158 yards and two touchdowns and catching four passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. \nBut that’s what big players do in big games. \nFuller, to his credit, wants to talk more about the team than himself. But he also understands that his truckload of Division I scholarship offers and his high profile after being selected for the Army All-America Bowl shines a huge spotlight on him. \nEspecially in the biggest games. \n“That’s OK,” Fuller said. “I like the pressure. \n“We’re definitely excited about this game. The reason we play the game is to be challenged, and this game is going to be a big challenge.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:26:55.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
