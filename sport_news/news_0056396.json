(Image Source: Steve Mitchell/USA TODAY Sports) \nPractically over night, the New York Mets went from being one of the most inept offenses in all of baseball to one of the most prolific. The starting pitching was always there, but it was the transformation on offense that allowed the Mets to pull away from the Washington Nationals in the NL East, a run that started on July 31. The day began with a deadline deal for OF Yoenis Cespedes and ended with a Wilmer Flores walk-off homer against the Nats. \nHow did the offense get better? It was a three-pronged formula, which started with GM Sandy Alderson making deals. The GM made a minor move adding veteran infielders Kelly Johnson and Juan Uribe before making a big splash with the Cespedes trade. Complementing the reinforcements was the return of 3B David Wright and C Travis d’Arnaud to the everyday lineup. In addition, rookie OF Michael Conforto has added some youth and pop to the batting order since being called up. Here’s a look at the starting lineup and bench heading into their National League Divisional Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nThe Infield: The only player remaining from New York’s last postseason team, the 2006 NL East Champs, is David Wright. He isn’t the slugger he once was, but Wright is still a productive hitter—his .289 BA and .379 OBP lead the team—who rakes against left-handed pitching. On the opposite corner 1B Lucas Duda is a pure slugger with 27 homers and 33 doubles in 471 at-bats. He’s having a down season in terms of BA, just .244, but a good eye allows him to get on base at a solid .352 clip. In his sixth full season, 2B Daniel Murphy did what he does…put the ball in play (only 38 Ks), spray doubles all over the field (team-high 38) and knock a few over the fence (career-high 14 HRs). At SS, Terry Collins has been splitting time between Rueben Tejada and the aforementioned Wilmer Flores. Tejada provides more patience at the plate and was strong after the All-Star break (.287) but he is expected to start Game 1 more for his glove than his bat. New York’s best lineup is with Flores at SS. He doesn’t walk enough for the organization’s liking but with 16 homers he provides a lot more power than Tejada. His walk off against Washington was just one of several clutch hits he’s provided the Mets with this season. You have to wonder if Collins has or will consider playing Flores at 2B against lefties. All five of the IF regulars are homegrown players. \nNY Mets Preview: Young Guns Harvey, deGrom & Syndergaard Lead the Way \nThe Outfield: The one mainstay in the outfield from Opening Day to the postseason is Curtis Granderson , who is the only Met with as many as 500 ABs with the team this season. The right fielder has really taken to his leadoff spot, leading the team with his 91 walks, just the second time in his career he’s gone over 80. While he’s been a better than expected table setter (.364 OBP, 98 runs), Grandy hasn’t sacrificed power as he slugged 26 round trippers (most since 2012) and drove in 70 runs. The big difference maker has been Yoenis Cespedes, who has 17 homers and 44 ribbies in just 57 games with New York, giving him a WAR of 2.3 in just two months time. His .942 OPS with the Mets is easily the best on the club. Cespedes is the type of transformative middle-of-the order bopper the franchise has lacked for years. Rounding out the OF are the team’s oldest and youngest position players, 36-year old free agent addition Michael Cuddyer and 22-year old rookie Michael Conforto. Cuddy’s first season in the Big Apple has mostly been a disappointment, as he failed to provide the middle of the order presence the Mets were hoping for (10 HRs are his fewest when he plays 100 games/has 300 ABs). Since coming back from the DL and playing on a limited basis, he’s been better post All-Star break (.302 BA vs. .244 pre-AS). A big reason the Mets haven’t had to push Cuddyer has been the emergence of Conforto, who like the team in general, has arrived ahead of schedule. Batting .270 with nine HRs (5 in September) and 14 doubles in 174 ABs, the lefty hitter has flashed excellent bat control and tremendous power. The rookie’s .841 OPS is second only to Cespedes. \nThe Dish: Between the deals and the more ballyhooed return of David Wright, the impact of having a healthy Travis d’Arnaud in August and September was overlooked. The oft-inured d’Arnaud is a productive bat when he’s in the lineup. In just 239 at bats this season, the backstop has connected on 12 homers and 14 doubles with 41 RBIs, that’s some serious production from behind the dish. \nThe Bench: The trades, call-up and newfound help didn’t just vastly improve New York’s lineup, it gave them a suddenly formidable bench as well. Veteran Kelly Johnson is capable of playing the infield and the outfield, and figures to be the top bench player. He’s an experienced professional hitter who has HR power (14 this season between the Mets and Braves). Like Johnson, CF Juan Lagares is a starting caliber player the Mets have coming off the bench. The Gold Glover has been playing hurt all season and he’s been better when used sparingly (.291 in August, .333 in September). When searching for a pinch hitter, Collins will also have a choice of Cuddyer or Conforto, whomever doesn’t start. The same goes for the non-starter at SS. Flores would provide more offense, while Tejada is more likely to be used as a defensive replacement. With Juan Uribe unable to make the NLDS roster due to injury, OF Kirk Nieuwenhuis has beat out speedster Eric Young for the final roster spot. Rookie C Kevin Plawecki has a talented bat, but more often than not has looked like a rookie (.219 BA). If things go as planned he will not see much action against the Dodgers. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
