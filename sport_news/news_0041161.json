(AP) - Michelle Tetreault's (TAY'-trohz) daughter didn't know what \"repent\" meant when she spotted a man with a sign warning \"Repent! The end is near!\" But the Somersworth, New Hampshire, girl is plenty sorry now that her mom is facing a $124 traffic ticket for using her cellphone to snap a picture of the man.\nMoments after Tetreault took the picture, she was pulled over. She was told the man with the sign was an undercover officer and ticketed for using a cellphone while driving. That's illegal in New Hampshire.\nAs states ban text messaging and using hand-held phones for drivers, police departments nationwide are getting creative. Tetreault calls it a \"stinky way\" to enforce the law, but Somersworth police Chief Dean Crombie says he has an obligation to keep the city safe.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:02:09.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
