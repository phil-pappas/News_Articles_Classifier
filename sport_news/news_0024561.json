On short notice, LSU did their best to give South Carolina a homely feel. The result created a novelty feel, as Tiger Stadium was less than half full. \nTiger Stadium seats over 102,000. The official attendance Saturday was 42, 058. \nNovelty aside, Les Miles and the Tigers handled a struggling Gamecocks team by the score of 45-24, on their way to a 5-0 start (3-0 in SEC). \nOffensively, LSU racked up yards of 624 yards of total offense, including 396 on the ground.

He also caught 3 passes for 25 yards. \n“Don’t get caught from behind,” Fournette explained when asked what was going through his mind on the 87 yard scoring run. \nFollowing the win, Fournette spoke to ESPN, offering his support to the flood victims in South Carolina. \n“I want to send my prayers and empathy to the people of South Carolina…I’d like to auction off my game jersey and donate the proceeds to the flood victims.” \nWith the game in hand, Fournette sat out the closing minutes of the third and the entire fourth quarter. \nLSU’s offensive line was dominant all day, paving the way for a bevy of LSU running backs to shine. Freshmen Derrius Guice added a game best 164 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. Sophomore Darrell Williams found paydirt twice on his way to 58 yards on 9 carries. \nTiger quarterback Brandon Harris continues to show poise, putting together his best statistical game of the season, going 18-28 for 228 yards and 2 touchdowns.

Malachi Dupree led the team in receptions with 6 for 74 yards and a touchdown. \nThe strong offensive performance was highlighted by the time of possession, as LSU held the ball for 39:53 compared to only 20:07 for South Carolina. \nDefensively, the Tigers held the Gamecocks to 283 yards. \nLSU stays at home this week, awaiting a huge SEC showdown next Saturday against the undefeated #11 Florida Gators. Kickoff from Tiger Stadium next week is set for 6:00.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:01:18.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
