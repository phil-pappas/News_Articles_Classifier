Sometimes, however, the most obvious solutions fail miserably — particularly when it comes to building a bullpen, perhaps the most difficult job a baseball executive faces. Veteran free agents such as Tyler Clippard and Darren O’Day might get the most money of the relief pitchers who change teams this winter, but they won’t be the only difference-makers. If Red Sox president of operations Dave Dombrowski is to overhaul his bullpen most effectively, he’s going to have to be creative — and here are a few differenT places he could look: The established star Boston had little luck acquiring established relief pitchers in the Ben Cherington era. Andrew Bailey, Joel Hanrahan and Mark Melancon all flopped in their brief tenures in Boston. But it still will be tempting to target one of the game’s top relief pitchers via trade. Cody Allen, Cleveland: Allen struck out a career-best 99 hitters last season, the third year in a row he’d struck out at least 11 hitters per nine innings. One normally wouldn’t expect Cleveland to move a star like Allen, but the Indians have one of the lowest payrolls in the game and Allen is arbitration-eligible for the first time this season. If they aren’t certain they’ll contend and if they believe $3 to $4 million is too much to pay for a closer, they could make him available. The two-pitch starting pitchers Wade Davis and Andrew Miller stand out as two of the most successful starters to convert to the bullpen, but the list doesn’t end there. Joe Blanton made more than 250 starts in the major leagues before Kansas City and then Pittsburgh made terrific use of him out of the bullpen this season. The best candidates to make such a switch tend to be pitchers with just two big-league-caliber pitches, pitchers who would fare better if allowed to simplify their repertoire. Rubby De La Rosa, Arizona: No, it didn’t work out for De La Rosa as a starter in Boston. Yes, it would look odd to reacquire De La Rosa one winter after trading him away. No matter. De La Rosa has a 4.50 ERA in 60 starts in the major leagues, a seeming indication that he’s mired in mediocrity in that role. But he throws an upper-90s mph fastball and a swing-and-miss changeup, and that makes him intriguing as a reliever. Like Allen, he’s arbitration-eligible and on a team with tight budget constraints. Adam Morgan, Philadelphia: Morgan reached the major leagues for the first time this season and had decidedly mixed results in his 15 starts. He ranked among the Phillies’ top-10 prospects three years ago but has struggled to assert himself since, striking out just 82 hitters in 139 2/3 innings in 29 starts at the Triple-A level. It’s possible that shedding at least one of his three secondary pitches would allow him to thrive. Wily Peralta, Milwaukee: Peralta came to the major leagues as the Brewers’ top prospect in 2012 but has never lived up to expectations. He posted a career-worst 4.72 ERA this season, and his peripheral statistics backed that up. But his bread-and-butter pitch remains his slider, a pitch he could throw even more as a reliever than he does as a starter — just as Miller has done since his conversion. He is arbitration-eligible for the first time. The potential hidden gems Nobody saw Will Harris as a difference-making acquisition when Houston claimed him off waivers from Arizona last November. He was 30 years old, too old to be a prospect, and he’d posted a 4.34 ERA in 29 relief appearances the previous season. But his underlying numbers — most notably his 35 strikeouts in 29 innings — suggested he could be an impact pitcher, and that’s just what he was for Houston this season. Mike Broadway, San Francisco: He posted a 5.19 ERA ERA in 17 1/3 innings in his first taste of the major leagues a year ago, but that came after he pitched brilliantly in 48 1/3 innings for Triple-A Sacramento, striking out 64 and walking eight. The righty’s signature pitch is a late-breaking slider that even lefties couldn’t handle — he struck out 36 left-handed hitters last season and walked just three. Leonel Campos, San Diego: Now 28 years old, Campos has made just seven appearances in the major leagues with the Padres. The reliever-turned-starter-turned reliever struck out 68 hitters in 49 2/3 innings at Triple-A El Paso last season, and hitters came up empty more than 40 percent of the time they swung at one of his pitches — best among all Triple-A pitchers. He even allowed a mere two home runs all season in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League. Jeremy McBryde, L.A. Angels: McBryde posted a 4.66 ERA in 62 relief appearances at Triple-A Salt Lake this season, his first in the Angels’ organization. But that ERA looks far better in the context of his 68 strikeouts against 23 walks in 63 2/3 innings pitched — along with his 66 strikeouts and 26 walks in 65 innings at Triple-A Sacramento the previous season. His underlying numbers are those of a pitcher who can get hitters out consistently, but he has never gotten a crack at the major leagues.
