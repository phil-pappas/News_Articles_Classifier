They’ve scored just 11 touchdowns — Montana State has 25 in one fewer game — and average just 19 points per outing, the Big Sky’s second-lowest tally. They’re also 12th in both passing efficiency and rushing offense. \nAll signs point to a Bobcats rout. Ash knows better, however. His defense is allowing 36.5 points per game, 11th best in the league. And while his squad will be seeking its 10th consecutive win in this series, these programs have staged some dramatic clashes in years past. \n“Our team is not looking at the record, we’re looking at the film,” Ash asserted Tuesday. “We’re seeing athletes on that film.” \nQuarterback Garrett Safron and top receiving target DeAndre Carter — who gave MSU fits during last year’s 59-56 thriller that featured more than 1,300 yards of offense and 49 points in the fourth quarter alone — have moved on. A few familiar faces remain, however. \nReceiver Nnamdi Agude burned cornerback Bryson Keeton for a 74-yard score on the Hornets’ first play last October. After two snaps, he had 111 yards, and teamed with Carter to overwhelm the Bobcats with 17 catches for 381 and five scores. \nAgude’s running mates now include 6-foot-2, 210-pound senior Shane Harrison, who caught eight balls for 125 in the opener, and Isiah Hennie. The sophomore is the first in program history to log a punt and kick return touchdown, and is second in the Big Sky in all-purpose yards (138). Bobcats co-defensive coordinator Kane Ioane likened the 5-7, 150-pounder to Jayshawn Gates. \nIn the backfield, junior Jordan Robinson, who is averaging more than 5 per carry, will be gunning for a fourth consecutive 100-yard effort, and also poses a credible threat in the short and intermediate passing game. \n“They do have great skill-sets as far as both receivers and the running back. … They’ve got length on the outside and speed on the outside,” Ioane remarked. “Everyone’s got a 6-2, 6-3 high jumper out there that they just throw the ball up to. … We need to put a ban on that somehow. \n“(Robinson is) a dynamic running back that can hit the home run on any given snap, any given time he touches the ball. … We have got to limit his yards per touch, not necessarily his yards per carry.” \nWho lines up under center — and near 6-8, 305-pound left tackle Lars Hanson, who has started every game since 2013 — remains to be seen. Daniel Kniffin started the first four games, but was injured against Eastern Washington. Southern Methodist transfer and fellow sophomore Kolney Cassel, who appeared in five games with the Mustangs and even started against Texas A&M, took the reins last week. He responded with a 28-for-44 effort for 294 yards and two touchdowns. He opened the final drive with five consecutive completions, but misfired on third and fourth down as the Hornets’ rally fell short. \nSacramento State outgained Northern Colorado, 438-179, and ran 21 more plays (83-62). \nCassel is fourth in the league in passing efficiency, while Kniffin is sixth in passing average (214.6). \n“They’re pretty much the same guy. … They’re about the same size, they both have good arms, and they’re pretty mobile; the offense doesn’t call on them to run a lot, but they can,” Ash said. \nAdded Ioane, “At any moment, they could have a breakout day.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:44:09.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
