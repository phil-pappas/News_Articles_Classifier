What do you think? Log in and start commenting \n“They have given him the platform and put him into their team. We are pleased about that.” \nAppleton has already suggested he would like to extend Graham’s stay but with more than a fortnight to run on his original deal, Jackett insists there is plenty of time for that to be discussed. \nIn any case, the Wolves head coach admitted, should he maintain his form, the winger could soon be challenging for a first-team spot at Molineux. It’s nice to have young prospects that people are talking about and just this season he’s come on a lot, really improved with good performances in the U21s,” said Jackett.
