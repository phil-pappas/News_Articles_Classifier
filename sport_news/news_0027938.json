When I was a young kid, I remember I played with the likes of Peter Rufai, Stephen Keshi, who was the leader of our squad at that time. \n\"We know Sunday Oliseh is trying to build a new squad, but he still need the experienced players in the team because at the end of the day, it is all about results, maybe the next person to call it quit could be Mikel. So, I think it is not a welcome development,\" Esin told C ompletesportsnigeria.com . \nEsin also called on the Nigeria Football Federation to wade into the matter. \n\"I think this is something the NFF should step into and address because they are the football ruling body in Nigeria. When players start bringing in personal interest into the national team, it shows they've lost interest in the national team. Patriotism is not there anymore, the zeal of coming to represent is not there anymore. \n\"I believe there is a lot of intrigues going on and we have to put our house in order. I back Oliseh, but he has to try and do something especially with his older players, because we all know players and their egos.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:04:57.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
