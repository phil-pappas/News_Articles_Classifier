We have a result now and it's a point against the champions of last year,\" he added. \n\"If we'd won maybe we'd have been lucky, but unfortunately we couldn't hold on. \n\"We've had a good performance now but we know we can be better.\" \n(Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty ) \nOur top photos from the month of September.
