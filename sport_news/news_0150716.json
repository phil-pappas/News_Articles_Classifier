Brash, a big entourage, looking for the biggest stage and coaching name to call home — a three-ring recruiting circus — and it has been warranted on occasion.\nBut this week provided a counter argument.\nFour local players — Thomas Jefferson’s Shamorie Ponds, Christ the King’s Tyrone Cohen Jr. and David Cole, and Cardozo’s Ray Salnave — made commitments to St. John’s, Holy Cross, Robert Morris and Monmouth, respectively, decisions that flew in the face of the idea of the ego-driven city kid who craves attention and needs the spotlight.\n“They had good people sending them the right messages,” said Christ the King coach Joe Arbitello, crediting Salnave’s and Ponds’ high school coaches, Ron Naclerio and Lawrence Pollard. “It’s about where they fit in.”\nCohen, a relentless lefty wing and A student, opted for academics first and basketball second in picking Holy Cross. The 6-foot-7 Cole, a gifted rebounder and skilled low-post offensive player, settled on Robert Morris.\n“Based on the year I expect to have and I think we’re going to have, with the way college basketball is, I think they would’ve went very high,” Arbitello said. “David could’ve went to the A-10 and Tyrone could’ve been a Big East player. Someone is going to have a scholarship open. But that’s when you run into problems.”\nSalnave, a huge star as a sophomore — the combo guard led Cardozo to the PSAL title that year — saw his stock fall last year after hearing from programs such as Kansas, Miami and Arizona, and receiving offers from St. John’s, Rutgers and Seton Hall. He has begun to get into better condition, and could have played out the season, waited for a bigger program to come along.\n“They were the ones that really stayed with him,” Naclerio said. “They sold him on being a Damian Lillard or Stephen Curry, a mid-major star. You can be a big star in a small pond.”\nThen there was the slick 6-foot-1 Ponds, who has wanted to join St. John’s for a while now. Arizona and UNLV inquired about him, but he stood firm — Ponds wanted to be part of the rebuilding process in Queens — when others suggested he considered a more established program with an experienced coach.\nAll three left official visits on the table and rewarded the schools that stuck with them, the schools that clearly wanted — and needed — them the most, picking places they will be given the best chance to succeed at. Furthermore, it showed winning is important: Ponds and Salnave didn’t want the distraction of picking a college to interfere with a run at a city championship.\nIt’s reminiscent of the recruitment of current Rhode Island forward Hassan Martin from Staten Island’s Curtis High. Had Martin played out his senior season before committing, his recruitment no doubt would have taken off. But he felt he found the right fit in coach Dan Hurley’s program, stockpiling offers didn’t interest him and he will be an integral part of what many believe will be a top 20 team this coming season.\nYears later, it shouldn’t be a surprise if you see Ponds, Salnave, Cole and Cohen all similarly excelling for quality programs, too.\nSt. John’s hosted three-star Arizona forward Mitch Lightfoot on an official visit this weekend. He is also considering Kansas, Utah, Stanford and Arizona.\nSt. John’s assistant Matt Abdelmassih visited with German forward Richard Freudenberg overseas this week and fellow assistant Barry Rohrssen was in New Jersey on Tuesday to see Patrick School big man Nick Richards a day after meeting with top 10 prospect Thon Maker of Canada’s Orangeville Prep on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:40:39.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
