The group also sponsored free breakfast programs and community health clinics.\nThe Panthers were most active in the late 1960s and early '70s and were harassed and infiltrated by government agencies, particularly the FBI, whose director J. Edgar Hoover called them \"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.\" The FBI and Chicago police killed Fred Hampton, the leader of the Illinois chapter of the party, shot him in the head while he was unarmed and in bed after being drugged by an FBI informant.\nThe history of the Black Panthers is about aspiration and revolution, repression and uplift, violence and love. Stanley Nelson's documentary \"The Black Panthers: Vanguard of a Revolution\" uses a deft mix of archival footage and interviews with historians and some very articulate Panther veterans -- survivors might be a better word -- to explain what the Panthers did and how they became so influential in such a short period of time.\nTheir continuing relevance is apparent in their origins. The movement began as a response to police brutality in Oakland; young black men led by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale studied gun laws and organized armed patrols that monitored local police. Law enforcement didn't like being followed around by young men with guns, needless to say, and responded with a furious force that eventually broke the movement. But in the early days, starting in 1967, the Panthers captured the attention of the media and issued a 10-point program that emphasized education, housing, and employment. Point No. 7 is worth repeating:\n\"We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER of Black people.\"\nEldridge Cleaver, the author of \"Soul on Ice,\" emerged as a Panther leader along with Seale and Newton, who was convicted of manslaughter in the death of an Oakland police officer and spent three years in jail. A national \"Free Huey!\" campaign gained traction and membership swelled as the erratic Cleaver fled to Algeria to avoid prison for a rape conviction.\nThe dichotomy between the peaceful, community-building activities of the Panthers and the criminal acts committed in the name of the party is outlined but never reconciled in Nelson's movie. The less appealing aspects aren't ignored, but there's much more time spent on free breakfasts than on how party leaders divided up the proceeds from robberies. The women who were the backbone of the party, particularly Ericka Huggins and Kathleen Cleaver, talk eloquently about how they were inspired by the movement and spoke up for equality within it. The founders are either dead (Newton, Cleaver) or chose not to be interviewed (Seale). With so much material to cover, Nelson omitted any mention of Angela Davis, George Jackson, and the infamous fundraising party at Leonard Bernstein's apartment that Tom Wolfe skewered in \"Radical Chic.\"\nThe Panther leadership faltered at a crucial time. Newton took a hard turn toward crime and drugs after his release from prison and conducted a series of sometimes-violent purges of all but his most loyal followers. Hampton's death robbed the party of a potential unifier, the \"messiah\" that so worried Hoover. The FBI's covert operations against the Panthers were a major part of its notorious COINTELPRO efforts against antiwar and other protest groups in the 1960s.\nThe legacy of the Panthers is complicated. They raised consciousness and had significant accomplishments but were stained by crime and violence. Government and police repression was unrelenting and often illegal. Disagreements and weaknesses within the party were exploited by agents and informants in ways that destroyed any chance of long-term success.\n\"We were making history,\" Huggins said, \"and it wasn't nice and clean. It wasn't easy.\"\n\"The Black Panthers: Vanguard of a Revolution\"\nGrade: B\nRating: Unrated\nRunning time: 113 minutes\nPlaying at: Opens Friday, Oct. 9, at the Hollywood Theatre. \"The Black Panthers\" will air next year on PBS.\nCast and crew: Kathleen Cleaver, Jamal Joseph, Elaine Brown, Claybourne Carson.
