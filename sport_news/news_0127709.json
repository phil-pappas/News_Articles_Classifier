By the time Nauset finally got on the scoreboard, they were down 41 points. Running back Michael LaFrange and quarterback Nick Couhig combined for five touchdowns to lead Falmouth to a 41-14 win against Nauset on Saturday night at Guv Fuller Field. Falmouth (4-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast League) outscored Nauset (0-4, 0-2 ACL) 28-0 in the first half, going up when LaFrange caught the opening kickoff around the Falmouth 5-yard line, shed numerous tackles around his 40 and then burst into the open field, easily outrunning Nauset's few remaining players on his way to the end zone. Colby Murphy's first of five successful PATs made it 7-0 Clippers just eight seconds into the game. LaFrange's touchdown kicked off a first half in which the Clippers completely outplayed the Warriors and might've led by even more at halftime had it not been for holding penalties wiping out good runs. Falmouth gained 188 yards and picked up 10 first downs; Nauset finished the half with negative-8 total yards of offense, picked up just one first down and didn't record a play for positive yardage until midway through the second quarter. “They were young and inexperienced, and our experience and our athleticism really beat them,” Falmouth coach Derek Almeida said. “I don't think we necessarily executed all that well or played all that well.” “We just couldn't execute,” Nauset coach Mike Sherman said. “They're a very good football team, very well coached. Falmouth did an excellent job. We knew what we were getting into. They're very well-disciplined and they're tough, and we didn't respond very well to the challenge.” LaFrange also had a 32-yard touchdown run with 55 seconds left in the half, once again spinning his way out of tackles along the Falmouth sideline before sprinting in for a 28-0 lead. LaFrange finished with 71 yards on eight carries. “He had a bunch of big plays tonight, but he's a better player,” Almeida said of LaFrange. “He can play at a higher level than he is, and right now the injury is really kind of holding him back.” Falmouth also took advantage of two interceptions, both times converting the turnover into an interception on the opposite end. Trent Leachman's pick set up the Clippers at the Nauset 28, and a 30-yard from Couhig to Tyler Brown paved the way for a 2-yard Couhig touchdown run and a 21-0 lead with 8:13 left in the second. Brown picked off Nauset quarterback Travis Van Vleck early in the third quarter, returning the ball 53 yards to the Nauset 17. Falmouth chewed 24 yards on a fourth-and-18 when Couhig's pass bounced off the hands of Sam Koss but Emmet Kelliher caught the deflection at the Nauset 1, then Couhig snuck it in for a 35-0 lead. Couhig also broke off a 39-yard touchdown run on Falmouth's next drive – the last for the offensive starters – running a triple option to the right but then spinning his way out of a tackle and cutting back to his left and outrunning the last few Warriors defenders to the end zone. Couhig rushed for 65 yards and three touchdowns and completed seven of 13 passes for 91 yards. Koss had Falmouth's final touchdown, a 4-yard rush off a pitch by Couhig for a 14-0 lead two plays into the second quarter. Nauset did finally get on the board late in the game, twice scoring after Almeida sent in his reserves for the fourth quarter. Van Vleck rushed 4 yards to the end zone, then the Warriors converted a Falmouth fumble into a 2-yard score by Isaiah Honeycutt, with Van Vleck rushing for the 2-point conversion to make it 41-14 Clippers with 3:47 left in the game. Those two scores did little more than make the final score a bit closer. Through the first three quarters, when both teams played their starters, Falmouth outscored Nauset 41-0 and outgained them 284-40 in total yards.
