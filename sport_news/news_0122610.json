The Green Wave put together a masterful offensive performance en route to a 4-1 victory over Randolph to earn their third consecutive Morris County Tournament title. \nIn the first half, opportunity knocked over and over again when junior forward Matt Christou delivered three dangerous throw-ins into the Rams’ box, but the Green Wave were unable to conclude. \nFinally, in the 36th minute, Christou’s fourth throw-in was sent home by senior forward Bobby Fabricant. Christou’s ball was initially lost in the area in front of the goal, but it eventually found Fabricant's right foot and he buried it into the net. \n“It feels great to be county champions again,” Delbarton head coach David Donovan said. “Morris County is a very strong county top to bottom, and against a team like Randolph ... it’s a good victory for our boys.” \nTo begin the second half, the Green Wave kept applying pressure with speed and precision passing. Five minutes in, sophomore Mark Forbes scored the second goal of the game. \n“It was huge to score,” said Donovan of Forbes’ early second-half goal. “When you play a team like Randolph and give them an opportunity to stay in the game, it’s a very different 80 minutes. Scoring from different people was good too. We were in a bit of a scoring drought, and maybe we opened it up a little tonight.” \nFive minutes later, Forbes took a set piece on the far side of the 30-yard line. The efficient cross found the head of senior defender Brian Finn, and he sealed the goal with a beautiful header into the top right corner of net. \n“It feels awesome winning a third county championship in a row,” said Finn, who was named the Otto Haas MVP of the MCT. “I’ve never been MVP of a county tournament before, so it’s definitely a special feeling.” \nThe Rams scored their only goal of the game in the 20th minute, when Green Wave goalkeeper Santiago Robertson-Lavalle lost the ball from his hands. Mateo Panizza knocked in the rebound with his head to cut Randolph’s deficit to two goals. \nHowever, the Green Wave were awarded a penalty kick two minutes later, and sophomore Kian Alberto buried it into the bottom left corner of the net past the outstretched arm of the Rams’ goalkeeper. \n“It’s definitely going out with a bang,” Finn said. “We just have one more, a state championship. That’s the one we have to win next.” \nStaff Writer Dan Canova: (862) 240-2878; dcanova@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://dailyre.co/1N018NL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:39:36.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
