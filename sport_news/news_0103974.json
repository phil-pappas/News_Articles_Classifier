He will take over a club that finished fourth in the five-team American League West division, 12 games back of the first place Rangers.\nThe Mariners consider Servais as one of the most complete, well balanced and inclusive baseball people in the game with the tools to get the franchise back on track.\n\"He is a communicator with strong baseball acumen and leadership skills,\" Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto said in a statement. \"I truly believe his strong character and career experiences as a player, coach and executive have prepared him for this opportunity.\"\n(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Mark Lamport-Stokes )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:16:53.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
