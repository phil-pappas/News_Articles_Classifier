Aspen’s Kahn scored a goal for the Skiers in the closing seconds of overtime Thursday evening, breaking a scoreless tie and posting a dramatic 1-0 homecoming victory over Roaring Fork at Aspen School District Stadium. Kahn, who had been Aspen’s mayor of the midfield throughout the game, closed on a loose ball deep in the Roaring Fork end with just seconds to play in the second 10-minute overtime. He collected the soccer ball at his feet, and then ripped a right-footed shot across the goal and into the net. The goal came after nearly 100 minutes of scoreless soccer marked by extended passing exchanges from both teams and tough defensive stands. “What a great game,” Aspen head coach Dave Francis said. “When that goal (went in), that was a lot of relief. I couldn’t be happier for them.” Francis said the teams matched up in a tough game — the Rams finished with 14 shots; the Skiers had 13. Roaring Fork had five corner kicks; Aspen had six. Each team was whistled for 13 fouls. “By his own admission, Harry has struggled a little bit to find his game this season. He’s gotten frustrated with himself, but he’s worked his way back into his best form,” Francis said. “Today, I think he was the best player out there. “Harry was winning balls everywhere. He was attacking their back line, getting forward,” Francis said. “If anyone deserved that goal, it was Harry.” He had been supported by aggressive attacks from teammates Guillermo Flores, Ilex Cherry and Raul Menendez, among others. The back line of Aspen’s defense was anchored by Nikko Wehse and Zach Storm along with Oscar Solis, in front of shutout goalie Charlie Van Allen. Roaring Fork countered with strong shots from Christian Alvarado, Aidan Sloan, Joseph Flores and Marcos Ramos. “What we got today was a full team ... everybody working hard,” Francis said. “I thought we moved the ball fantastic.” Aspen improved to 4-6-1 overall; they are 2-3-0 in the Western Slope League. Roaring Fork fell to 4-5-1 overall, 0-3-0 in league play. The Skiers will return to their home field for a second homecoming week match Saturday against visiting Rifle. The game has been moved to 10:30 a.m. because of officiating schedules.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:15:56.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
