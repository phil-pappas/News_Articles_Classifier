The game which was keenly contested, saw both teams go neck and neck right from the first quarter up to the fourth. And at the end of the day, it was the Cameroonians that came out tops by the slimmest of margins. Prior to their loss to Cameroon, D’Tigress had lost their opening game to old nemesis Angola before going on a winning spree against Guinea, Algeria, Senegal and Mozambique. The defeat means D’Tigress have missed out on automatic qualification for the 2016 Olympics in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. Nigeria men’s team, D’Tigers, had emerged champions of Africa for the first time after defeating Angola in the final of Afrobasket in Tunisia.
