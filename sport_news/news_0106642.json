Caption (Craig Lincoln for Shaw Media) The Morris defense has allowed just 120 points through seven games this season. By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMORRIS – With four losses already, the playoffs begin for the Morris football team Friday night against Northern Illinois Big 12 rival Sycamore. Related Links \nThe Redskins enter the game with a 3-4 record, having lost their last three contest. Sycamore, meanwhile, is 4-3 with wins in their last three games, two of them decisive wins over teams that have beaten the Redskins. \nThe Spartans downed Kaneland, 35-7, two weeks ago and beat Yorkville, 20-14, last week. \nNot surprisingly, Morris coach Alan Thorson knows his team is in for a challenge. But, it’s a challenge he feels the Redskins can meet and overcome. \n“This is for sure do-or-die for us as far as the playoffs,” Thorson said. “We’ve been working very hard at practice all week. Even though they have three losses, Sycamore is a very good team, and they are fighting for their lives as well. They have Sterling in the final week, so they want to lock up their fifth win this week and we need to avoid our fifth loss.” \nAfter losing three of their first four games, Sycamore appears to have hit its stride. \n“Their defense is very good,” Thorson said. “Nick Niemann is a very good linebacker and their whole defense is aggressive and has good players out there. It certainly won’t be a cakewalk for our offense. We have to make sure we are blocking well this week. \n“Their offense is a shotgun-wing type of offense. They like to run out of it, but they can throw it well, too. Their starting quarterback [Brett Bemis] was out last week, but their backup [Tyler Sulaver] went 10 of 14. We’re going to prepare for Bemis to be in there, but they don’t lose much if he’s not.” \nFor Thorson, the opponent is secondary. He is more focused on the way his team plays. \n“We have to come ready to play,” he said. “We need that team that played against Sterling to show up. We’ve been preaching to them all week that our playoff lives are on the line. These kids are good players. \n“We have seven games under our belts now, and we’ve worked too long and too hard to be making some of the mistakes we have made the last few weeks. We need to just come out, not hold anything back and play the way that I know in my heart that these kids can play.” \nAlthough having four losses with two games left to play isn’t the ideal situation for any football team, Morris was in the same spot last season, won their final two regular season games, and made a run to the Class 5A quarterfinals. \n“We’re not happy to be in this situation,” Thorson said, “But, we can’t change what happened in the past. All that matters is the next game. \n“All the guys that are back from last year have been through this. They saw last year what can be done, and they saw what it takes to get that done. But we can’t look ahead and say we are going to make a run in the playoffs unless we get there. And that starts Friday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:39:46.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
