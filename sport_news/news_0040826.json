In fact, they may start the 2015-16 season looking up at as many teams in the Eastern Conference as they are looking down.\nThat doesn’t mean the B’s have no chance. It’s just slimmer than in the past. Some teams that made the playoffs last year are still on the upswing. Some that didn’t are ready to make a surge. The Bruins are trying to find their way. Every night will be a challenge for them.\nHere’s a thumbnail look at some of their toughest opponents in the Eastern Conference:\n•    CAPITALS : The Caps proved they can be both offensively explosive and defensively responsible under first-year coach Barry Trotz last season, finishing in the top 10 in both goals for and against. They possess both speed and a heaviness that can take a team far. While Alex Ovechkin gets the accolades, Nicklas Backstrom might be the best power-play guy in the league, and he’s very good in his own end, too. Goalie Braden Holtby really came into his own last year.\nWhy they’ll win : After years of losing in a Game 7, they acquired Mr. Game 7, Justin Williams. T.J. Oshie won’t hurt, either.\nWhy they might struggle : Ovechkin has had seasons in which he’s been uninterested in playing a 200-foot game. Could this be one of those years?\n•    LIGHTNING : The Bolts gave the impression last season that they will be a power to contend with for years to come. They have one of the league’s most gifted goal-scorers in Steven Stamkos, a legitimate Norris Trophy candidate in Victor Hedman and a good goalie in Ben Bishop. Add the vaunted Triplets line of Tyler Johnson, Ondrej Palat and Nikita Kucherov and you’ve got a very formidable foe that is likely to keep the B’s chasing them all season.\nWhy they’ll win : They’ve got the talent, and now they have the experience of going to the Stanley Cup finals.\nWhy they might struggle : If UFA-to-be Stamkos is still unsigned midway through the season, that could be one hell of a distraction.\n•    RANGERS : The Blue-shirts have been to the conference finals in three of the last four years and were oh-so-close to returning to the Stanley Cup finals for the second straight season. Henrik Lundquvist has put his playoff mediocrity far behind him and has played some of his best hockey the last few springs. Despite his recent trouble with the law, Jarret Stoll could be a very good low-risk ($800,000) high-reward pickup while former Boston College players Chris Kreider and Kevin Hayes are prime-time performers.\nWhy they’ll win : At the age of 26, captain Ryan McDonagh is the kind of defenseman every contender needs.\nWhy they might struggle : The loss of Carl Hagelin weakens the Blueshirts’ biggest strength — team speed.\n•    CANADIENS : Goalie Carey Price can keep the Habs in any game and P.K. Subban is the most electrifying defenseman in the game. Max Pacioretty blossomed as a player. Now the Habs expect him to be a leader as his teammates voted him their captain. GM Marc Bergevin made an odd trade, sending character guy Brandon Prust to Vancouver for underachiever Zack Kassian. It’s already gone bad, with Kassian being placed in the league’s substance abuse program after an early morning accident. Maybe it’s the old, irrational Bruins fan in me, but Alexander Semin seems like just the kind of unwanted-but-highly-skilled player to revive his career in Montreal.\nWhy they’ll win : Alex Galchenyuk’s move to center should bring out the best in the talented young forward.\nWhy they might struggle : Coach Michel Therrien could wear out his welcome. He has before.\n•    PENGUINS : They are still flawed and top heavy, but the addition of Phil Kessel does make them a lot more interesting. Whether he plays with Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin, he’ll be playing with his best centerman since leaving Marc Savard and the Bruins behind. This is not a team against which you want to take penalties. While not elite, Marc-Andre Fleury was not as much of a liability last season as he had been in the past. The defense isn’t great, but Olli Maatta and Derrick Pouliot, two young D-men sent down at the end of camp, could eventually help.\nWhy they’ll win : Sheer explosiveness\nWhy they might struggle : The defense isn’t ready for prime time.\n•    BLUE JACKETS : OK, maybe this is going out on the limb a bit, but it’s hard to ignore the injuries that crippled this team at the start of last season, or the tear it went on at the end of the season (16-4-1 in March and April). Ryan Johansen is a stud and the Jackets have a handful of forwards — Scott Hartnell, Nick Foligno, Brandon Dubinsky, David Clarkson — who are true gamers. Brandon Saad was one of the biggest acquisitions of the offseason. They’re not great on the back end, but Jack Johnson is a point producer and Ryan Murray, if he can stay healthy, has a chance to be a No. 1 defenseman.\nWhy they’ll win : After tasting the playoffs two years ago, they’re hungry.\nWhy they may struggle : They don’t know how to win yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:38:38.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
