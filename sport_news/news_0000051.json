It wasn’t a surprise. I didn’t expect us to score 59 points going into that game, but offensively, our offensive line did a great job, our skill players stepped up and played very well. They flew around the whole night.” \nMetts ran 17 times for 174 yards and four touchdowns, including runs of 73, 13, 19 and 30 yards. He completed 14 of 25 passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. In total, he tallied 411 yards of offense. Madison County finished with 505 yards of total offense. \n“It was a great feeling,” Metts said. “It was something we’d been wanting all season, honestly. We hadn’t felt it since the Oglethorpe game in our first scrimmage game and it was great to finally get a region game.” \nIt was the first win for the Red Raiders since October 2014 and the first time they’d scored more than 50 points in a game since topping Northview 58-0 in 2002. And it was a big win for Metts, who took over the starting job for the final two games of last season after injuries piled up. \n“It was different last year because I felt like last year it was more just he’s hurt and I’m going to play until he’s back,” Metts said. “Last year, it was more I’m a guy. It was kind of scary, honestly. This year, it’s got my age friends playing with me and (I’m) more comfortable, I guess you could say.” \nNow, Smith has noticed that Metts is starting to grow into his role as the team’s leader. \n“(Before) he was more behind the scenes, wasn’t very vocal,” Smith said. “The leadership thing is something he had to work on, and as the year has gone along, as each year has progressed, he’s gotten better. This year, as the season’s progressed, he’s gotten a lot better taking a more vocal role with the offensive huddle and he’s had to play defense, too. It’s really pressed him to be more assertive, to take more ownership of it.” \nAnd Madison County hopes that translates to a few more wins before the season is over. They’ll host North Hall this Friday. \n“We can win a few more games this season before it’s over with,” Metts said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:54:30.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
