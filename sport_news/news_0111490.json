Put them on the ice at the same time, as Joel Quenneville had been doing since last spring, and you have a dangerous, yet responsible pairing.\nOf course, it’s far more complicated than that. Keith is also a terrific backchecker. Hjalmarsson occasionally finds himself down low in the offensive zone. Brent Seabrook likes to pinch from the right point and look for a big one-timer. Trevor van Riemsdyk’s a stay-at-home defender, but will get aggressive when he sees an opportunity develop in front of him. Trevor Daley sometimes plays like an extra forward, using his speed to join the rush.\nThere aren’t just two types of defensemen. Every blue-liner has his own style, his own favorite move, his own fallback options. It took years of playing together for Keith and Seabrook to develop the sixth sense they had for each other on the ice.\n“It’s just a comfortability,” Seabrook said. “Getting to read a guy, his tendencies. For an example, playing with Dunc, sometimes he takes a couple strides up and then he circles back. As his partner, you have to prepare for things like that.”\nThere is no comfortability for the Hawks right now. At least, not to the Keith-Seabrook level. Just as Hjalmarsson and Keith were getting used to each other as the top unit, Keith underwent surgery to repair a meniscal tear in his right knee. Now all three pairings are unfamiliar ones.\nCurrently, Hjalmarsson has moved back to his natural spot on the left side (he’s played on the right side the last three-plus seasons) with van Riemsdyk. Seabrook has been working with rookie Viktor Svedberg since the preseason. And Daley is now skating alongside David Rundblad, who’s happily back on the right side. It’s a far cry from the stability the Hawks have had in their pairings over the past few seasons.\nAnd just as it can take time to develop chemistry with new forward lines, the defensemen are feeling each other out, too. For van Riemsdyk, playing alongside Hjalmarsson against the opponents’ top line is a lot different than playing with the more aggressive Daley on a third pairing.\n“It’s just kind of reading off one another, whether he’s up in the rush or not in the rush,” said van Riemsdyk, who played a career-high 22:34 on Thursday. “You can’t really have any strategy going in, you just know what type of player [Hjalmarsson] is and just read off the situation. They want us up there in the rush with the forwards, so I’ve got to jump up whether I’m with Daley or I’m with Hammer.”\nHjalmarsson is proof that there’s no right or wrong way to build a pairing. For the last three seasons, he was slotted next to conservative Johnny Oduya. In the playoffs last spring, he was paired with the dynamic Keith. Each of those pairings was a key cog in a Stanley Cup run for the Hawks.\n“I don’t think there’s an ideal matchup,” Hjalmarsson said. “It’s tough to say, because I matched up good with Johnny O last year, and he’s more of a defensive-minded guy. And with [Keith], it worked really well in the playoffs. We did our job very well. So I think it can go both ways. It’s just a matter of how the coaches want to keep the D pairings.”\nQuenneville has made it clear that he doesn’t want his defensemen changing their style just because Keith is out, or just because they have new partners. While it will take time to learn all the little idiosyncrasies, habits and deficiencies in everybody’s games, Quenneville preaches the same thing to everyone, no matter their skill set — be smart in your own zone, make quick and hard passes out of the zone, and be ready to join the rush at any time.\n“I don’t think it’s too hard to play with new partners, actually,” Rundblad said. “Every D pair plays the same system, and every player knows what to do and when to do it. It’ll take some time to get that personal connection with each other, but everyone’s playing the same system the same way. I don’t think it’s too big a deal.”\nEmail: mlazerus@suntimes.com\nTwitter: @marklazerus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:47:10.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
