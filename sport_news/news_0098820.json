Then I called them hypocrites. You’re booing me? I’m telling the truth. I’m the honest man here. That guy’s the hypocrite, he’s the liar and you are cheering for him and booing me? You’re a hypocrite. Then I realised I got it. I’ve got the ultimate thing of what a heel looks for: a kernel of truth that I can pound down people’s throats until they get so sick of it they don’t want to hear it anymore.\nThat’s when I knew I had it. A combination of that, working with Shawn Michaels and Nick Bockwinkel. The company had just put out an AWA documentary. I grew up in Winnipeg as an AWA fan. Watching that documentary, I just remember how freaking great Nick Bockwinkel was with his persona, his character, his suits and ties, using big words. And then that movie No Country for Old Men came out where Javier Bardem played Anton Chigurh, a serial killer that was very calm, very collected, not yelling, not screaming. Just matter of factly just the way it is. Combining those things together; this is it. This is my masterpiece. That’s kind of where it all started.\nChris Jericho poses prior to a live event in Germany last year. Source: Getty Images\nFS: One of the biggest moments of your career was back in 1999 when you debuted on WWE television and interrupted The Rock. It’s become arguably the greatest debut of anyone in the company and an iconic moment. What was that day like leading up to you going out there for someone who had always dreamt of being in the WWE and debuting with the biggest star there?\nCJ: For me, it was nine years before I got to the WWE, working around the world from being a main-eventer to whatever I was in WCW to having this buzz and just knowing that it doesn’t matter what I’ve done for the previous nine years. All that matters is what happens from now forward. I was smart enough to realise that. That whole promo, I wrote it by myself on the floor of my apartment at the time. No rehearsal. No writer helping me. No approval from Vince. No nothing. Just me.\nOne thing we talk about regarding whether things were better back then, I don’t know if it’s better or worse, but I do know now that would never happen again. That segment would be rehearsed and over-rehearsed and analysed and changed and moved. For some ways, it might be better. For some, it might be worse. I watch that promo back now and it was pretty good. There are a million things I would change to make it better. Is it one of the best moments of my career? No. Is it one of the more memorable and most critically acclaimed because of what people remember about it? Yeah. By far. So it was a great debut. Once again, what do you follow up with? For the first six months following my debut it was pretty much down the toilet. That was a lot of politics and me not knowing as much as I thought that I knew. And there was a lot of just not being that good as some of the other guys.\nWrestler Chris Jericho takes over FOX 10's weather 2:34 Wrestling favorite Chris Jericho is in town with his band, but before his interview, he took over the FOX 10 weather\nOctober 9th 2015 11 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Even though I had worked around the world, you hear about the WWE style. That’s a real thing and I knew nothing about it. I didn’t even know how to bump and feed when I got to WWE. No one even taught me that in WCW. They don’t bump and feed in Japan. Well, you do now but you didn’t back then. Take a move and sell it for 10 minutes. That’s not how things work when you’re a heel in the WWE. Politically, I didn’t have any friends or engage myself properly because I just came in same as always. I didn’t play any political games. I just hung out, did my thing and a lot of people took offence to that and that’s where things started following apart from that end. But I remember that night being a pretty cool night because it seemed like most of the people knew that Jericho was coming out. Then when my name flash on the Titantron, it was one of the bigger pops of my career and the future was in the palm of my hands at that point. That five-minute segment is definitely one of the most memorable moments of my career, for sure.\nFS: You say it’s one of your most memorable moments of your career, but there are things you would change about it. I think it’s moments like that debut or championships won that fans look at as the stand out moments. What are the moments in your perspective that stand out?\nCJ: It’s funny because I just read on Twitter that today is the seventh anniversary of Michaels vs Jericho ladder match for the world title. People ask me, what’s your favourite match of all-time? That’s it. That happened exactly seven years ago in 2008. That’s a standout moment for me and not just the match itself, which is one of my favourite actual matches, but also the fact that it was a culmination of eight months work for the world title and we were supposed to work one month. It was supposed to be a one night thing, but we both realised it was something special and worked it into seven, eight months, whatever it was, and it culminated in a ladder match for the world title, which was incredible. That one stands out for me.\nWrestleMania 19 against Shawn, once again, stealing a show that’s a WrestleMania stands out to me. The whole Rey Mysterio angle was incredible. The match I had with Neville in Tokyo. The match I had this week with (Kevin) Owens. All those things mean a lot to me because I love the fact that I can still go out there and have these really great matches with innovative spots, stuff you don’t see with guys who are just like me but 15 years younger. I like that. All of those moments stand out to me. I can go through every year of my career and say there are stand out moments. There’s too many of them. The body of work over the last 25 years, it’s really cool for me to go, “Oh my gosh, there’s this, there’s that, there’s that.”\nA dude reminded me last night, one of our old security guards, was talking about a match Rock and I had in Honolulu in 2002 or 2003. Rock will tell you that it’s his favourite match of all time. I still remember that night. Talking about a highlight of my career, it’s a memorable one and I hadn’t thought about it in years until that guy brought it up. There are a lot of those types of things as well.\nJericho cops a kick from Triple H at WrestleMania XVIII. Source: Getty Images\nFS: I know you’re not one to dwell on the past a lot or have a lot of regrets. That being said, is there one thing over you’re career that you feel you missed out on or wish you done something different?\nCJ: Not really because I think that everything that I did was a product of what my knowledge and what my experience was at the time. My first title run when I won the Undisputed Championship wasn’t the greatest, but at the time, I didn’t know any better and didn’t have the attitude and the knowledge that I do now to make it better. For example, the whole Lucy the Dog and that sort of stuff.\nAt the time, I didn’t think it was great but I didn’t really have any choice to go and change it. You do the best you can with what you’re given. I learned that in WCW. Whether you’re out there for a minute or you’re out there for an hour, you do the best you can with what you’re given. I don’t have any regrets about my career because I think it was exactly the way it was supposed to be. It was exactly the way where I could have these three books of stories about these first 23 years of my career because I have all of these great experiences coming from being a world traveller and learning all of these different styles.\nI wish some of my friends were still alive but, once again, that’s not for me to change. I couldn’t change that. So, I think everything’s gonna happen the way it’s supposed to happen. And there’s nothing where I wish I would have zigged instead of zagged and if there is, they’re very minor things and thinking about it now, nothing pops in my head.\nFS: Even when you mention different things that maybe you didn’t like at the time that were given to you, I think looking at it now you can appreciate the challenge of it. Thinking what can I do now? What can I do to make this work? And that can make you better as a performer.\nCJ: Yeah. There’s nothing that I can’t take and try and make good. Sometimes they failed. I was given a really brutal segment a few years ago, some Highlight Reel segment with Barrett, Miz and I think Brad Maddox. When it was time, Michael Cole said that it was the worst segment in the history of the business because Vince told him to say it. Afterwards, I was like, why would you have him say that? He said because it was terrible. I was like I know it was terrible, but do you really have to say that? That was the best I could do with that s----y thing. He was like, “If you knew it was going to be s---, you should have told me.” I was like, you go out there and try to do the best that you can with that you’re given. Most times, there’s a way to make it work but sometimes there’s just no way to do it.\nI remember one time I got a call from Brian Gerwirtz who was the head writer and he said this week, you’re going to be in the thing with apes. I was like what? “Planet of the Apes” was the new movie that had come out and the Planet of the Apes are going to be there and Vince loves apes. He decided he wants the apes involved and I don’t know how to do it but put them with Jericho and he’ll figure it out. It ended up being pretty funny but it involved a pie in the face for Stephanie, a bunch of ape jokes and bananas and pulling out everything we can, every bell and whistle, and we made it good.\nTalk about what the hell are we supposed to do with apes? Same thing happened with all of those guest hosts when we went through that phase five, six years ago. Guess who was in there with them every week? And some of them were great. Bob Barker, awesome. Ozzy Osbourne, great. Mike Tyson, amazing. And some of them were the drizzling s---. Those two NASCAR drivers, I don’t remember who they were. [Eds Note: They were Kyle Busch and Joey Logano.] Al Sharpton, awful, awful. Dennis Miller, terrible! But you have to go out there and try and make them look as good as you can. That’s part of what my job is as a performer.\nJericho also plays in the band Fozzy. Source: Getty Images\nFS: You mentioned you and Vince getting into arguments over storylines. What’s the worst argument the two of you have gotten into?\nCJ: The worst argument is when I got the job to host “Downfall,” the game show that I had to audition for quite a few times. I didn’t tell him because I didn’t want him getting involved because sometimes the company will get involved and screw things up for you. (laughs) And when I finally got the gig, I didn’t tell him and it was on the front cover of the Hollywood Reporter, which he flipped out at. He forbid me from doing it and I was going to do it. No you can’t. Yes I can. Well, you’re fired. You can’t fire me because I quit. You can’t quit because you’re fired. I’m going to fly to Connecticut to punch you in the face. I’ll give you my address. I’ll be waiting. That sort of a thing. We kind of just hung up on each other. We ended up working it all out but that was the biggest actual argument.\nMost of the time with Vince, it’s not arguments, it’s just debates or it’s a very calm, “this is what you’re doing.” I wasn’t supposed to be working with Fandango at WrestleMania 29. It was supposed to be Ryback and that was kind of the deal we had made. That was the promise that was made and it was changed very quickly for no real reason. I wasn’t happy about that either. Nothing against Fandango, but that spot wasn’t a really WrestleMania worthy match, but once again, once I was told that this was my role, I made it a WrestleMania-worthy match. We had about three weeks to come up with an angle and if you go and watch that match and watch the night after, the most over guy on that show was Fandango. And I’m taking a huge chunk of the credit for that, thank you very much.\nFS: WrestleMania 32 is going to be a huge show next year at AT&T Stadium in Dallas. The company hopes to have 100,000 people there in attendance. Do you see yourself being a part of that show?\nCJ: Yes, no, maybe. It all depends. I came back a couple of weeks ago to do the Night of Champions thing and I don’t come back just for one-offs. There’s always a reason why I do everything that I do. That could give you some clues. It’s going to be the biggest show of all-time. I haven’t done the last couple of Manias and, to me, it wasn’t that the opportunity wasn’t there or the offer but what am I going to be doing? Who am I working with? What’s the storyline because I know that for WrestleMania, everyone comes back.\nI was the main event of WrestleMania 18. It might be the only WrestleMania main event I might have; it might not be the only WrestleMania show-stealer. But I also know that if you’re not in the main event, your real estate on TV is less and less. I’m smart enough to know that if you get the right person and just given my own little world, give me my own little ten minute segment every week like me and [CM] Punk had three years ago when we had an amazing angle that was never the main event of anything. It was just like well, here’s the crossover segment. Here’s the open segment. All right, that’s cool. Punk and I were smart enough to know that’s all we need. We don’t need 20 minutes of talking. We don’t need electrocutions or going through tables or whatever the hell they do to build up their angles. All we need is just 10 minutes of talking time, 10 minutes of TV time and we’ll do the rest. So that’s always been my mindset. What can I figure out to do on the biggest show that’s going to kind of back door my way into becoming one of the more intriguing storylines of the entire night? If I can figure that out, then I’m always open for it.\nYou can read the full interview with Jericho at Fox Sports here .\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2F90djQ0eDrBTSZvD0mkfzq4lZRzuI--2B%2Fpromo268632261&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.cc.com/shows/nothing-to-report", "http://www.foxsports.com/buzzer/story/chris-jericho-wwe-25-anniversary-100815", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/602cfb78b0d185679fe7415cbc04d15f", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGsBRImD0po", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/92814e5622d4087e2e432e7d21914b4b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b837c573e9221cab9dfc07a7484794d9", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3a6310ac538a51b9906c6ea626d2acf2", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:50:05.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
