Students are invited to wear them on Saturday when they’ll be joining the community for a memorial walk, 1.6 miles around the entire school campus.\n“The students felt very strongly that they wanted to do something active so we’ll have the bulbs available for planting and then actually go on the walk together,” explains Tara Mizell.\nSome 10,000 tulip bulbs – to be planted in the stadium. Rochelle Lubbers and Tara Mizell are both part of the Marysville Tulalip Recovery Committee; Rochelle represents the tribe, Tara the city. They’ve spent the last year holding recovery-related events like suicide prevention training.\n“I worked in the community for over 20 years, my husband is a firefighter here in town,” says Tara.\n“Born and raised in this community like many people who live here and work here and recreate here,” says Rochelle.\n“There’s no way for it not to be a personal event,” agrees Tara. But both say the tragedy and the somber anniversary is most personal for the students who not only survived but overcame it.\n“Each day we get a little bit stronger,” concludes Tara.\nThe shirts cost $10 each and they're so popular the recovery committee already needs to print more of them. They'll be for sale Wednesday through Friday at Lasting Impressions in Marysville.\ncomment (7)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:10:14.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
