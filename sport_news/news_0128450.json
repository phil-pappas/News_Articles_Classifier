And Barta, the athletic director who signed Ferentz to a lucrative 10-year contract extension in September of 2010, took much of the criticism. \nBut according to a national database released Thursday by USA TODAY, the price tag for Ferentz is becoming a little more palatable with each passing season. \nFerentz currently ranks 14th among NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision coaches with a total compensation package of $4.08 million for the 2015 season. Ferentz's total includes a $525,000 payment that he will receive only if he remains head coach on Jan. 31, 2016. \nHe’s fourth among coaches in the Big Ten Conference. \nFerentz has been Iowa's highest-paid public employee for years. In comparison, Gov. Terry Branstad is paid $130,000 annually. Athletics officials frequently point out that taxpayer dollars are not used for coaches' salaries at UI and Iowa State University. \nUSA TODAY research of 2014 salaries showed Ferentz also was paid $4.08 million in 2014, which included a $525,000 retention bonus for remaining as head coach on Jan. 31, 2015. \nDATABASE: Compensation for Bowl Championship Subdivision coaches \nIn 2011, the year after Ferentz’s extension, he was fifth nationally and No. 1 in the Big Ten. \n“I've said publicly, and privately to Kirk, that it would be my goal to have him retire at Iowa,\" Barta said when the extension was announced. “This contract is a statement supporting that commitment.” \nAlabama’s Nick Saban is the highest-paid coach nationally with total pay of $7.08 million, according to USA TODAY, which gathered information through open-records laws as well as federal income tax returns. \nMichigan’s Jim Harbaugh leads the Big Ten this season at just over $7 million. \nBob Stoops of Oklahoma tops the Big 12 at $5.4 million. Iowa State’s Paul Rhoads is ninth in that 10-team conference with total compensation of $2.2 million (which includes a one-time retention bonus of $300,000 for being employed by the university on Feb. 15, 2015). \nCyclone followers might grouse about the cost of doing business in a Power Five conference, but gripes about Ferentz’s earning are rampant when the Hawkeyes struggle on the field. \nIf you took Ferentz’s $4,075,000 compensation package in 2014 and divided it by Iowa’s 7-6 record, it comes out to $582,143 per win. \nThis season, however, the Hawkeyes are 5-0 and ranked No. 22 in the Associated Press poll. So fewer people are complaining about the price of victory (which is currently $815,000 with seven games remaining). \nFerentz is also helped by the coaches who have joined the $4 million-a-year club. \nBack in 2012, Ferentz was the nation’s sixth-highest paid coach. All five of the men above him had won at least one national title. Now the list is peppered with coaches who are being paid more for potential success. \nHarbaugh, for instance, led the San Francisco 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance, but this is his first season with the Wolverines. \nPenn State’s James Franklin has a compensation package of $4.4 million and owns an 11-7 record in his second season with the Nittany Lions. \nTexas’ Charlie Strong, who owns a 7-11 record with the Longhorns, will receive $5.1 million as speculation about his job security swirls. \nGeorgia’s Mark Richt will receive roughly $4.1 million, but he hasn’t won an SEC title since 2005. \nCritics will point to Ferentz’s overall record of 39-30 since signing his 2010 extension, but Barta made it clear that winning was only part of the deal. \n\"Kirk is arguably the best football coach in the country,\" Barta said back then. \"Beyond that, he and his wife, Mary, are world-class people who care deeply about the university and the state.\" \nEfforts to reach Barta for this story were unsuccessful, and Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard declined to comment. \nFor the fiscal year that ended in June 2014, Barta was the state's fifth-best-paid employee, at $921,432, and Pollard 27th, at $550,000. The top five spots in the state salary list are occupied by athletics employees; following them are mostly physicians who work for UI. \nHighest-paid coaches in the U.S. \nAlabama's Nick Saban, $7,087,481 \nOhio State's Urban Meyer, $5,860,000 \nOklahoma's Bob Stoops, $5,400,000 \nFlorida State's Jimbo Fisher, $5,150,000 \nTexas' Charlie Strong, $5,100,270 \nTexas A&M's Kevin Sumlin, $5,000,000 \nPenn State's James Franklin, $4,400,000 \nLSU's Les Miles, $4,385,567", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:31:16.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
