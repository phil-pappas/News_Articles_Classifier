On Friday, Bath can win an LCAA Division I title outright with either a win or tie against rival Hornell. The Rams got one goal and one assist from Connor Strong. Elliott Hillman also netted a goal for Bath and teammate Casey Hyer added with two assists. Warren opened the scoring by connecting on a 35-yard blast with 26:32 remaining in the opening half. Warren’s shot caught the bottom of the crossbar and ricocheted into the right corner of the goal. Twelve minutes later, Bath’s lead grew to 2-0 when Strong headed in a free kick from Hyer. The Rams took a 2-0 lead into intermission. Bath’s Steven Binkowski made four saves in goal to record the shutout. “It was a good game,” Bath head coach Matt Hill said. “I was pleased that we were able to score four goals. It’s a nice accomplishment against a team like Dansville.” Bath (10-4-1) will play at Hornell at 6:30 p.m. Friday. The Rams will look to clinch their first LCAA title since 2011. Bath only has one loss in the division, while Hornell and Livonia each have two division losses.
