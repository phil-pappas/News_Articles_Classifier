With the win over the Bulldogs, the Titans have now won an impressive eight straight wins and sit in the drivers seat for the league title. “I knew the girls were capable [of this], but I also knew how inexperienced they were coming into the year,” Coal Ridge head coach Aimee Gerber said. “I’ve been preaching all season that we have to take care of our side of the court and play with heart. I truly believe that this run is a direct reflection of teamwork and heart. “I’m so proud of their attitudes and effort.” Along with Mooney and Kotz — who also had nine digs, five kills and four aces — Kaitlyn Detlefsen chipped in with 13 kills, eight blocks and three aces. Kaitlyn Harlow added five kills, and Emily Wright added 13 digs. With two games left in the regular season, the Titans are closing in on the league title. They’ll host Rifle, Oct. 20, for Senior Night to honor Detlefsen and Karissa Feese. The Titans will close out the regular season at Grand Valley on Oct. 22 in Parachute. Rams top Longhorns in four sets Against a rival, the Roaring Fork Rams girls volleyball team picked up their fourth win of the season, 22-25, 25-19, 25-16, 25-20, with just three games left in the regular season. After starting slow in the first set, the Rams bounced back to put away the Longhorns for good behind Lyndsey Hansen’s 12 kills and Lily Ramos’ 22 digs. “We came out a little slow early,” Rams head coach Jennifer Dority said. “The Rams redeemed themselves, for the most part, in the final three sets. After we decided to start playing our game, we kept enough pressure on Basalt to keep them down.” With just a few games left in the regular season, the Rams are trying to finish high in the league standings, but Dority says a lot must happen before they can finish where they want to. “We definitely have our work cut out for us,” Dority said. “This league is up for grabs right now.” Along with Hansen and Ramos, Grace Brown added 22 digs, seven kills and five aces. Madilyn Kuhl added 12 digs, six kills and two aces. Ashley Hall chipped in with 12 assists, along with Jasmin Lopez’s 16 assists and an ace. At 4-10 (2-2) the Rams are in position to make a late push up the ladder in the league standings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:20:56.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
