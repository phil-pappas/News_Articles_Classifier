I am probably the palest person you’ve ever met, if you’ve met me. But do I dutifully apply a layer of SPF every single day of the year as I am aware I should? Do you? Does anyone? When it’s chilly and gray outside and I am climbing directly into a taxi, is sunscreen the first thing on my mind?\nIt’s common knowledge that UV rays—the stealthy, non-burning kind that can cause skin cancer, hyperpigmentation and wrinkles—are out year-round. They don’t mind that it is October. “If there’s light, there’s sun,” said dermatologist Lisa Airan, M.D. And exposure to it, she added, is the most aging thing a person can do, apart from smoking.\nThe sun is certainly less intense in colder months. But “the cumulative effect in winter still amounts to appreciative damage,” explained dermatologist Dennis Gross, M.D. He estimates that exposure to 10 hours of winter sun each week equals approximately a full hour of height-of-summer sun. Those five-minute walks add up. Sitting by a window indoors adds up, too.\nThe New Cult Classic ENLARGE A hydrating, antioxidant-rich formula that promises clear pores. ‘We sell so much it’s crazy,’ said Jessica Richards, owner of Brooklyn apothecary, Shen Beauty.

Suntegrity Skincare 5 in 1 SPF 30 Natural Moisturizing Face Sunscreen, $45, Shen Beauty, 718-576-2679 Photo: Marko Metzinger for The Wall Street Journal So what’s preventing all of us from getting with the year-round SPF program? People (myself included) don’t like using it. What is grudgingly acceptable in the summertime—a thick, potentially pore-clogging cream; the scent of coconut—feels like a deal breaker in the winter. “A lot of the active ingredients in sunscreen are like motor oil,” said Dr. Airan. “Making a formulation that’s cosmetically elegant is really difficult.”\nBut not impossible. The trick is to find a product that acts, feels and smells like skin care (as opposed to beachy sun care ) and that fits seamlessly into the rest of your regimen. “It can’t have an odor; it can’t be sticky; it has to go under makeup,” said dermatologist Patricia Wexler, M.D. The good news is that options—for every skin type and concern—abound.\nSunscreen can cause breakouts, no matter the weather. To that end, Dr. Wexler recommended Avène’s mineral-based, fragrance- and oil-free Ultra-Light Hydrating Lotion SPF 50+: “It doesn’t leave any residue and is easily washed off—I don’t know how they do it,” she said. EltaMD’s antioxidant-rich UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46, the cult product on the tip of every dermatologist’s tongue, balances hydrating hyaluronic acid with pore-refining lactic acid. And for those with dry skin, supercharged moisturizers bolstered by SPF—like Clinique’s SuperDefense SPF 20 with the non-greasy consistency of crème fraîche—do the trick as well.\nThe new hybrid primers—products designed to create a smooth surface for makeup to glide across—with the added oomph of SPF are proving to be a game-changer, too. Colore Science’s Face Primer SPF 30 is “the first thing that goes against my skin everyday,” said Dr. Wexler. She follows with her own day cream and a foundation, which then “slides on like silk.” SkinCeuticals, a favorite of Dr. Airan, makes an oil-absorbing matte SPF 50 primer; New York’s most in-demand facialist, Georgia Louise—who has blemishes, melasma, and anything else that threatens skin’s perfection on the mind at all times—raved about Murad Invisiblur Perfecting Shield SPF 30: “It’s so light, you don’t even see it,” she said.\nOr skip the priming step and go straight to makeup. Suntegrity’s zinc-based, paraben-free 5 in 1 Natural Moisturizing Face Sunscreen SPF 30, which comes in four tints, “flies off the shelves” at Brooklyn apothecary Shen Beauty, said owner Jessica Richards. YSL’s mousse-like All-in-One BB Cream Skintone Perfector, with a respectable (for winter) SPF 25, is so hydrating and feather-light that I barely look like I am wearing foundation. I just look like I have great skin. Soft-focus glow. Subtle rose de mai scent. Score.\nIt is Dr. Dennis Gross’s chemical-free Dark Spot Sun Defense SPF 50, though, that has possibly changed my life. It has the added benefit of combating pigment changes in the skin (via melatonin, which thwarts abnormal melanin production). It melts in, like butter. It has no scent. I forget I am wearing it. I actually want to use it everyday.
