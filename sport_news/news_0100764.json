Episode. Ever,” as the grotesquely obese and exceedingly socially challenged Comic Book Guy character says on The Simpsons. His trademark phrase perfectly describes NLCS Game 4 for Chicago Cubs fans, who are all spending today curled up in the fetal position on the couch binging on Ben and Jerry’s Phish Food and listening to Whitney Houston’s “Didn’t we almost have it all?” on repeat. \n(Or maybe it’s just me, who’s doing that, not every other Chicago Cubs fan) Nevertheless, if you still need a keepsake of the Chicago Cubs postseason run (yes, four post season wins still qualifies as a “run”), then I have a shirt for you. The #StraightOuttaHibernation shirts are now 2 for $3 @Walgreens pic.twitter.com/iwtnd6EM9b \n— Paul M. Banks (@PaulMBanks) October 22, 2015 \nYes, the “Straight Outta Hibernation” Cubs tee- get it?? It’s based on the meme and homage that every single person alive has been making since the film “Straight Outta Compton” came out in early August! It works on so many levels!!! \nYour friendly neighborhood Walgreens store (I guess I’m giving them some inadvertent native advertising here, and I’m not even getting compensated for it) knocked the price of these t-shirts down to 2 for $3 hours BEFORE game four even started. \nNow that the Chicago Cubs are eliminated, perhaps you can now get three of these t-shirts for $0.99 \nThere are other bad Cubs postseason tees out there. Like the infamous Jake Arrieta “Now watch me Pitch. Now watch me KK” \n— Cubbie Karyn (@CubbieKaryn) October 5, 2015 \nThey owe me royalties on that anyway, since I was the first to make the “Now watch me Walks+Hits/Innings Pitched, Now watch me ney ney” joke. At least, I think I’m the first to make that joke. I don’t think anyone else alive would want to claim that. \nHowever, if you want your Jake Arrieta shirts awful, and I mean really awful. Here’s a t-shirt made of just Arrieta’s infamous “nipple tweet.” Wow. If someone handed me this shirt, and it would save me from frostbite, I might put it on. Maybe. \nOr maybe not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:00:02.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
