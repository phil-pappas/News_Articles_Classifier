Hawkins will undergo surgery Tuesday but is expected to return to practice in early November. \nHawkins suffered the injury in practice over the weekend. \n\"I really feel bad to have to report this because Dom was playing so well,” head coach John Calipari said. “He was so much more confident, so much more skilled. There was no doubt he was in the rotation, and now he’s just got to get back and stay in shape. We’re looking forward to getting him back in November.” \nHawkins has played in 56 games in his Kentucky career, including nine starts in his sophomore season. The Richmond, Ky., native has been one of UK’s best on-ball defenders in his first two seasons as a Wildcat, serving as a key stopper during Kentucky’s memorable 2014 Final Four run. \nAmong Hawkins’ highlights during his sophomore season was a career-high seven-point outing vs. Boston, a career-high six-assist day in a win over his hometown team, Eastern Kentucky, and a six-point, three-assist, two-steal night in a career-high 20 minutes at home vs. Missouri.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:04:12.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
