(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) more > By JEROME PUGMIRE - Associated Press   \nWhile Wales counted who was fit in the squad to play Fiji in Cardiff, France casually rotated its squad to meet Canada in Milton Keynes as both sides look for a third consecutive win at the Rugby World Cup on Thursday. \nCoach Philippe Saint-Andre has built a reputation for tinkering incessantly with France, and appears to have no intention of slowing down here, after using every player in his squad against Italy and Romania. Except this time, rather than changing players on a tactical whim, he’s doing it to keep fringe players sharp if they’re needed later in the tournament. \n“We’re lucky enough to have used all 31 players,” he said. “You can see with all the injuries since the start of the tournament that a No. 3 player might be decisive one day.” \nWales needs little reminding of that, and there will be some unfamiliar faces on show at Millennium Stadium. \nWhen Warren Gatland unveiled his lineup, there were three injury-enforced changes to his depleted back division. Fullback Matthew Morgan, center Tyler Morgan, and winger Alex Cuthbert came into a backline that lost Scott Williams and Hallam Amos to tournament-ending injuries in Saturday’s thrilling 28-25 win over England. \nWilliams and Amos became the fifth and sixth Welsh backs ruled out of the World Cup this month, while fullback Liam Williams was unavailable against Fiji after a head knock against England. \n“I was talking to Prav (Mathema), our physio, yesterday and he said it was probably the worst run of injuries he’s been involved with as a team,” Gatland said. \nAlthough his forwards are holding up better - he has kept the same pack that defied England - props Aaron Jarvis and Samson Lee were still getting over calf problems. \nA Wales victory over Fiji would likely mean England has to beat Australia to stay in the tournament, and stop the Welsh from qualifying with a match to spare. \nFiji and Canada have lost their first two matches, and still hold out of hope of third place in their pools. \n“It automatically qualifies you for the next World Cup,” said Fiji coach John McKee, whose side has lost to England 35-11 and Australia 28-13. “So there’s still a lot for us to play for.” \nHere’s a look at Thursday’s games: \n___ \nWALES vs FIJI (8-1-1 overall, 1-1 in RWC), Cardiff, 1545 GMT \nThe Welsh are fielding their strongest side not only to rack the win that could advance them to the quarterfinals, but also to right some wrongs in the win over England.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:27:48.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
