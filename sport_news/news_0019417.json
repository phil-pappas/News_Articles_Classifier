The duo got their vehicle serviced after the competitive stretch but could not negotiate the first bend after they started the forward journey to Kishtwar and their gypsy veered off the road, said Manjeev Bhalla, organiser of the race. The possibility of some problem with the breaks or aggressive pickup could not be ruled out. Medical services were provided to them and X-ray was conducted at Bhaderwah after which the injured persons were evacuated through helicopter and taken to hospital, he said. Samrat sustained injuries and Gaurav, complained of chest pain and problem in back muscles, he said, adding that both were stable.
