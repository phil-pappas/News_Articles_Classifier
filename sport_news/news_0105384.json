In Haryana, upper caste violence had always got support from the government machinery, he said.\nIsaac said the protection given to perpetrators of such heinous crimes sent out a clear message. Dalits are leaving their traditional jobs and taking employment to raise their living standard and this is what was provoking upper caste groups, he added.\nThe CPM leader said such attacks were aimed at confining Dalits to their traditional occupation and blocking their socio-economic development.\n\"Haryana incident should be a lesson for certain Dalit organisations in Kerala. I hope those who gave Narendra Modi a platform and made efforts to make Sangh Parivar acceptable among the community have understood the reality. It is the responsibility of Dalit organisations also to fight against such atrocities,\" he added.\nHowever, BJP state vice-president P. P. Vava said the CPM's Dalit love was sham. \"Hundreds of Dalits were killed in Nandigram in 2007 when ruling CPM workers and police joined hands to chase away poor agricultural workers from their land in the name of SEZ. There was party- and government-sponsored genocide of Dalits under Marxist rule,\" he added.\nVava said in Kerala, a large number of Dalits remain landless, without houses, clean drinking water, electricity, roads, employment and health facilities. So what Dalit emancipation are the Marxists talking about? he asked.\nHowever, noted Dalit writer K. K. Kochu said the ghastly incident in Haryana would have an impact in the state since the BJP was trying hard to make inroads into the Dalit and backward communities.\nComparatively, the Left has been more favourable to marginalised sections like agricultural, cashew and coir workers. But many issues like land, livelihood means of Dalits and adivasis remain unresolved.\nStates: Kerala South kerala Thomas Isaac Also Read Food must look good, say experts Retailers rule roost, Onam loses old charm Good Samaritans to clean hospital in Hyderabad Sluggish monsoon plays truant", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/TeluguMatrimony_Textlink_620x40px.gif", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/THOMAS%20ISAAC.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151024/nation-current-affairs/article/thomas-isaac-warns-dalits-sangh-politics", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/THOMAS%20ISAAC.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151024/nation-current-affairs/article/thomas-isaac-warns-dalits-sangh-politics"], "published": "2015-10-24T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:07:50.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
