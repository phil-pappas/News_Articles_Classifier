Gus Malzahn’s squad started the season ranked No. 6 but after beating Louisville in its opener, fell out of the polls after an unimpressive win over FCS school Jacksonville State and losses to LSU and Mississippi State.\nLosing to the Bayou Bengals and the Bulldogs is no disgrace; both are nationally ranked and leading contenders in the SEC West. And four weeks into the campaign, Auburn seems to be getting its offense back in sync. The Tigers hung up some impressive numbers in the loss to Mississippi State, but failed to score a touchdown on four possessions inside the MSU 10.\nThey figure to lay the lumber to someone, and San Jose State looks like the perfect victim. The Spartans are 0-2 on the road, losing to Air Force and Oregon State by a combined score of 72-37. SJSU will be in for a big payday and a bigger beating when it ventures into the Deep South tomorrow. Auburn is favored by 20 points and gets our call.\nIn other games:\nTONIGHT\nTemple (-22) over CHARLOTTE — Charlotte has played two FBS teams and lost to both by a combined 90-21 count. The 49ers will be easy pickings for the undefeated Owls, who have impressive wins vs. Penn State and at Cincinnati.\nBYU (-17 1 ⁄ 2 ) over UConn — A brutal early schedule finally caught up to the Cougars last week, but after battling the likes of Nebraska, Boise State, UCLA and Michigan, facing the punchless Huskies should be a piece of cake.\nTOMORROW\nNorth Carolina (+7) over GEORGIA TECH — The Georgia Tech option attack may be tough to handle, but its defense has been ripped in losses to Notre Dame and Duke. After a turnover-filled loss to South Carolina, the Tar Heels have won three straight by an average score of 47-14.\nWestern Kentucky (-7) over RICE — These teams can definitely dent the scoreboard, but the Owls may need some time to recover from the 70-17 beating they took last week at Baylor. Look for the Hilltoppers to eventual prevail in a high-scoring affair.\nTCU (-14 1 ⁄ 2 ) over Texas — The hot seat for coach Charlie Strong must be getting warmer with the Longhorns losing three games in September for the first time in school history. And Trevone Boykin and the Frogs will stoke those flames with a lopsided win.\nNebraska (-6 1 ⁄ 2 ) over ILLINOIS — The 2-2 Cornhuskers are thisclose to being undefeated with heartbreaking losses to BYU and at Miami spoiling their record. They’ll get off to a winning Big Ten start vs. an Illini team that has struggled its last two games.\nNorthern Illinois (-3) over CENTRAL MICHIGAN — The Huskies played well at No. 1 Ohio State and at BC, the nation’s No. 1 defense, with nothing to show for their effort. MAC competition gets NIU back into the win column.\nBAYLOR (-17) over Texas Tech — The Bears lead the nation in total offense, averaging an amazing 767 yards per game. That’s more than 130 yards better than second-place TCU, which scored 55 points last week vs. Texas Tech.\nBOISE STATE (-24 1 ⁄ 2 ) over Hawaii — The Rainbow Warriors have been shut out twice this season (at Ohio State and at Wisconsin) and bring the nation’s 120th-ranked offense into Boise. After losing to BYU on Sept. 12, the Broncos have won their last two by a combined 108-14 and take no prisoners here.\nArkansas (+7) over TENNESSEE — The 1-3 Hogs have staggered out of the gate, but they gave undefeated Texas A&M a real battle last week and, with just one loss in SEC play, are still alive for the conference crown. They’ll keep things close vs. the Vols, who have trouble beating quality opponents.\nSAN DIEGO STATE (-8) over Fresno State — The rebuilding Bulldogs are 0-3 in FBS competition and coming off a 49-23 beatdown at San Jose State. The Aztecs aren’t much better but they get our call here.\nLast week: 5-6-1\nSeason: 21-26-1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:21:12.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
