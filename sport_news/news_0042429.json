City Section Division 1 title contender, as shown by this five-set win at Granada Hills. (photo by John McCoy/Los Angeles News Group)\nThey are a team without a home.\nEl Camino Real High has been forced to become a nomadic volleyball team this season with its home gym undergoing renovations.\nNo home matches. Limited practice time. Creative scheduling.\nCanoga Park was gracious enough to allow El Camino Real to use its facilities, and the Conquistadors have done their best to be flexible as they try to chase down their first L.A. City Section Division 1 crown.\nVIDEO: A look at the nomadic El Camino Real girls volleyball team\n“It’s been really hard and it’s definitely a challenge for us to have to overcome,” El Camino Real setter Isabella Barbera said. “We are conditioning in the morning a lot because we don’t have a gym, and we also practice at Canoga and we are very thankful for that. I don’t know what we would do without that.\n“We have to take every single second seriously in practice and even in matches because we do not have a lot of practice time.”\nThe coaching staff said it costs El Camino Real about $40 per hour to rent out Canoga Park. Monday is a two-hour practice session in Canoga Park’s small gym, and Wednesday is usually a three-hour deal in Canoga Park’s larger gym.\nThat’s about $500 per week for 12 weeks for a total of $6,000, not to mention the extra transportation to “home” matches.\n“We are treating every game like a road game,” Conquistadors coach Ian Lee said.\nBut the real cost comes in the form of time management.\nThe program has tried to compensate with morning conditioning, weight-room work or plyo training. It also forces the players to use their time-management skills to get their homework done and stay on top of their schoolwork.\nAll while chasing down a potential City crown, though the players say this experience is bringing them even closer together.\n“It’s definitely a confidence booster,” El Camino Real outside hitter Kayla Jacks said. “At first, it was like, ‘Oooh, how are we going to do this.’ We lost our home-court advantage. But luckily we’ve had fans coming to the other gyms and we have been working hard. I’m proud of how we’re doing.”\nThe Conquistadors have adjusted to life on the road. Even some of the parents have made a banner that reads “El Camino Real Volleyball” that they take with them for road games.\nLee also credits the El Camino Real administration for its handling of the situation and Canoga Park coach Jason Carbonell for opening his gym to the team, though the Conquistadors are trying to lock down a “home site” for the playoffs.\n“Our administration has taken care of us. They know it’s tough on us,” Lee said. “It’s also nice to get support from supposedly rival schools.\nAdvertisement\n“And give a lot of credit to the girls. It’s hard to get into a volleyball groove with all this happening.”\nAlthough the rust and lack of practice time was apparent in a season-opening five-set loss at Carson on Sept. 16 with just two volleyball practices under its belt, El Camino Real started to rise to the occasion.\nEl Camino Real swept Chaminade on Sept. 22 . It swept Chatsworth on Oct. 5 while mixing in Sylmar transfer Kaushanna Williams for the first time . It added a nonleague win at Eagle Rock.\nYet the crowning moment was a five-set victory at Granada Hills on Sept. 29 — even before Williams was cleared to play — for the Conquistadors’ first win over Granada Hills since 2011.\nWithout a home gym, El Camino Real must go back to Granada Hills for a second showdown Thursday.\n“That’s nerve wracking to have to go back there,” Jacks said. “They had a big crowd the first time, and me and the seniors are expecting an even bigger crowd this time. Hopefully, we can get the same result.”\nBarbera added: “It’s exciting. Let’s beat them twice at their place.”\nThis time, El Camino Real will have the terminal-hitting Williams on its side.\nDespite limited practice reps, Williams is fitting in nicely with El Camino Real’s corps of hitters that includes Jacks, Trinity Goodman, Lauryn Anderson and Celine Puruncajas. Tallie Monsalve has been steady at libero.\n“We were a top-four team in the City without her,” Lee said. “To add another gun to an already loaded team can be tough, but Kaushanna has had a great attitude and the girls have accepted her quickly.”\nJust like the Conquistadors have adjusted quickly to their lack of a gym.\n“It’s sad because I am a senior and we don’t get to have a true senior night,” Barbera said. “But at the end of the day, I just want to have fun with my team. If we win a ring at the end of the year, it will be that much better.”\nAbout the Author Reach the author at tony.ciniglio@langnews.com .\nFull bio and more articles by Tony Ciniglio Back to top", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/OTPbSjNvouQ", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151013/SPORTS/151019786/AR/0/AR-151019786.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=437"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:59:17.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
