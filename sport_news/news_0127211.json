And it’s a lot of fun when you play for good football teams.”\nA lot of players walking around McMahon Stadium would agree.\nHufnagel’s teams have put together seasons of 13, 10, 13, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 11 (and counting) wins. Not too shabby.\nMurphy isn’t the only former coach Hufnagel considers a mentor. He’s learned from some of the best.\n“Everyone I worked for, either as a player or as a coach, you always grasp something from them,” Hufnagel said.\n“I was able to be around a lot of great coaches — Wally (Buono) obviously is at the top of the list.\n“Bill Belichick, Tom Coughlin ... I’ve been around.”\nNot for much longer — at least not on the sidelines.\nHufnagel will move upstairs at the conclusion of this season, handing the keys to offensive co-ordinator Dave Dickenson.\n“To be honest, I don’t think you really look at it until you’re done,” Dickenson said of Hufnagel hitting the 100-win mark. “And I certainly hope he wins more than 100. It’s a pretty great number for the number of years he’s been a head coach, though.\n“I don’t think anyone can argue he hasn’t had unparalleled success. He’s a big reason why this organization is always at the top.\n“It’s ‘congratulations,’ but it’s a number. We play for other things and I’m sure he coaches for other things.”\nIn the NFL, much has been made of the ‘coaching trees’ beginning with legends like Belichick or Bill Parcells.\nThe same kind of tracking system would show Hufnagel’s reach goes from coast-to-coast, although he wants nothing to do with taking credit for what other coaches have accomplished.\n“I’ve hired good coaches and some of them have moved on and been successful,” Hufnagel said. “But they’re good coaches.\n“If they’ve learned anything from me, that’s a good thing but they have their own philosophies.\n“You do the things you think are necessary to help your football team win. And if I’ve helped other coaches in their progress, that’s a good thing.”\nDickenson, who has seen coaches come and go but has remained patient over the past few years, said he has always felt like he has had free reign to run his offence without anyone looking over his shoulder.\n“When you win, people want to take part of that organization,” Dickenson said. “It happens with players and coaches as well.\n“We’ve lost some coaches who, in the next year or two have said, ‘shoot, I should never have left Calgary.’ You get treated well, it’s a great organization.\n“But sometimes the money, at times, tempts people to go places without seeing the whole picture.\n“Huff never holds us back at all. He gives us the freedom to be creative and lets us do our thing, yet provides good guidance. If you have questions, he’s open on all three sides of the ball. I definitely learn every year from the guy.”\nHe hasn’t been the only one.\nscott.fisher@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/SUNScottFisher\nFastest to 100\nCoach Wins 100th win in game No.\nWally Buono 254 134\nJohn Hufnagel 99 140\nDon Matthews 231 158\nBud Grant 102 158\nEagle Keys 131 170\nDave Ritchie 108 170\nRay Jauch 127 177\nRon Lancaster 142 178\nFrank Clair 147 190\nBob O’Bilovich 107 195\nStampeders\nCalgary Stampeders Coach Huff shrugs off chase for win No. 100\nBy Scott Fisher , Calgary Sun First posted: Friday, October 09, 2015 07:56 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 10, 2015 12:00 AM EDT\nJohn Hufnagel is looking to join the 100-win club.\nThe Calgary Stampeders boss would become the 10th member of that exclusive coaching fraternity with his next ‘W.’\nHuff’s thought on becoming a coaching Centenarian?\nCouldn’t care less.\nThat 99th win was something special, though, as it put him shoulder-to-shoulder with his former GM/coach/mentor Cal Murphy.\n“I’m not concerned about that at all, really,” Hufnagel said of a potential 100th win on Saturday night when the Stampeders host the Edmonton Eskimos (5 p.m., TSN/News Talk 770). “I’m pleased I’m in the same conversation as a Cal Murphy.\n“But with those types of (individual accomplishments), I have the same mindset as our players do, which is to do what we can do to get the job done.”\nMurphy, who finished his coaching career with a record of 99-80-3, was a part of nine Grey Cup champions during his hall-of-fame career.\nAnd he clearly earned Hufnagel’s respect.\n Football NFL Week 5 predictions: Broncos look to extend record 0\nKryk's take heading into Week 5 of the NFL 0\nToronto\nRandall the Handle's NFL Week 5 picks 0\nNFL at the quarter mark: top performers ... so far 0\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SUNScottFisher", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-10T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:21:00.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
