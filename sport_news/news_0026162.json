The second with just over eight minutes to play in the game when Justin Thomas hit Ricky Jeune for a 46-yard touchdown making it a 43-24 ballgame. \nTHE BAD PART 2: Late in the third quarter, Clemson put Justin Falcinelli Justin Falcinelli #50 6-3, 293Middleton, MD View Full Profile in the game at center, presumably to give the redshirt freshman some experience. The plan went awry as he snapped the ball over Deshaun Watson’s head and into the endzone.
