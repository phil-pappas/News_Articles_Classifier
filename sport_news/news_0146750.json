Matt Dowell checked in on the surging Blue Hawks.\"The Blue Hawks have had a phenomenal start to the 2015 season. They've won 4 of their first 5 games and are 2-0 in the conference. Coach Stanton says it's all due to the effort the offense and defense are bringing to each game and he thinks that hard work has translated to exceptional consistency this season. \n\"Moving the ball offensively. We've done a really nice job there. There's just been a few situations where, down in the red zone, just finishing it off. And defensively, I think just that consistency of being able to get after things up front and our linebackers have played well all year and continue to do that.\"\"Some of us are starting to realize the fact that hard work pays off and just doing the things right every day. The stuff that can be a grind and that builds consistency. Just doing all the fundamentals the right way every time and that's what we try to stress on both sides of the football.\" \nAnd even though DSU has come to play in every game this season, they know there's still plenty of room to improve. \n\"That's why you coach, you wanna get better every game. That's why you play, I think, is to get better every game and that's always a goal of ours to win the football game, but to get better as a team and get better as an individual every day. We ask the question a lot here, 'are you better today than you were yesterday?' and that's important. That's key.\" \nStanton attributes the team's consistency this year to dedication and mental strength, but he also stresses to his team the importance of taking care of their bodies. \n\"You've got to stay healthy. Every team goes through that this time of year where you have to stay healthy and we're certainly no exception there where our guys have to stay healthy and be ready to go.\" General information or questions:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:17:43.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
