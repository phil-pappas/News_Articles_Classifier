It's a gross understatement.\nAdChoices After a video was released Tuesday of AnnMaria De Mars absolutely hammering Rousey's coach Edmond Tarverdyan, another one dropped Wednesday . And it's even worse.\nRELATED: Rousey's mom goes off on coach\n\"I would run over him with my car if there wasn't a law against it,\" De Mars said.\nIn the first video , De Mars alluded to the fact that Tarverdyan ignored Rousey when she first came in the gym because she was a woman -- even though Rousey was an Olympic bronze medalist in judo. It remains unclear, though, if there are other reasons why the mother of the biggest star in MMA loathes her daughter's coach.\n\"Every time I go in his gym, he used to say, 'How are you?'\" she said. \"And I'd say, 'How the (expletive) do you think I am? I'm in your (expletive) gym and I (expletive) hate you.' So now he doesn't ask me how I am anymore.\"\nRousey defends her title against Holly Holm in the main event of UFC 193 on Nov. 14 in Melbourne, Australia. This apparent feud between mom and coach could end up being a serious talking point leading up to that matchup.\n\"I hate that guy,\" De Mars said. \"He's like the most worthless human being God ever put on this Earth.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/13/9527615/ronda-rouseys-mother-says-daughters-coach-edmond-tarverydan-is", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FefKn6M3t6E", "http://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/680/ufc-193-rousey-holm", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/871/ronda-rousey", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2173/holly-holm"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:26:08.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
