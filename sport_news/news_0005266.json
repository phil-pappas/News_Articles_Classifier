The confidence level is there, we know exactly what is required (because) a 0-0 is not even a good result. To score goals, we have to attack.\"\nWenger confirmed later on Monday that Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, who was surprisingly picked ahead of Petr Cech against Olympiakos and conceded an own goal in the 3-2 defeat, is injured and will not be available.\nBut he denied that he might leave out Sanchez after a recent heavy schedule.\nHe also spoke of his admiration for Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, saying he respected the former Barcelona manager's \"positive philosophy\".\n\"But we played great Bayern teams (in the past) and beat them,\" he added. \"There is no team without weaknesses.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:37:07.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
