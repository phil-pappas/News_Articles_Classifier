D'Arnaud was batting .268 with .825 OPS, 12 homers and 41 RBI in 67 regular-season games and has also done a great job handling the Mets' talented young pitching staff. \nDodgers: Former top prospect Yasmani Grandal enjoyed a strong first half, but he began slumping after the All-Star break and has recently been dealing with shoulder inflammation. Still, Grandal finished the regular season with 16 home runs and 47 RBI and is also regarded as one of the best pitch framers in the game. \nEdge: Mets \nFirst base \nMets: Lucas Duda, when he's going right, is a force in the Mets lineup. He can get hot and carry an offense and becomes one of the best power-hitters in the game. But when he's cold, he's ice cold and he was too often this year for the Mets. \nDodgers: Adrian Gonzalez is one of the premier first baseman in baseball. He's a Gold Glove award winner and a slugger. He was the standout offensive player on the Dodgers, helping to carry their lineup through injuries and underperformance. And he's already dinged Mets pitching this year, homering twice. He's someone they should pitch around this series. \nEdge: Dodgers \nSecond base \nMets: Daniel Murphy makes occasional blunders on the field and on the basepaths, but he usually makes up for it with his production at the plate. Murphy hit a career-high 14 home runs with 73 RBI and finished the regular season with a .281 batting average. The Mets just call it 'Murph being Murph'. \nDodgers: His Dodger counterpart, Howie Kendrick, has been hampered by a hamstring injury over the last month, and it remains to be seen if he'll be at 100% for the NLDS but L.A. needs his bat. Otherwise it could be Justin Turner or Chase Utley splitting time here. \nEdge: Mets \nShortstop \nMets: Ruben Tejada will likely be the starting shortstop, having won the job over the last month as Wilmer Flores struggled and battled strep throat. He's the steadier defender and has improved at the plate this year too. The Mets just hope he can anchor their infield defense and help their pitchers. \nDodgers: Dodgers phenom Corey Seager joined the team as a September call-up and has definitely exceeded expectations, batting .337 with a .986 OPS in his first 27 big league games. Given his impressive results, the 21-year-old could feasibly displace veteran Jimmy Rollins as the Dodgers' starting shortstop in the NLDS. He's that good. \nEdge: Dodgers \nThird base \nMets: David Wright has been a franchise staple for more than a decade, but he missed most of the season after being diagnosed with spinal stenosis and will have to be given enough rest to properly manage his condition, which shouldn't be an issue in the playoffs. He's hit well since returning. \nDodgers: Two years ago, the Mets non-tendered Justin Turner. Since then, Turner has made the most of his opportunity with Los Angeles and become one of the team's most productive hitters. Turner finished the regular season batting .294 with 16 home runs and 60 RBI, both career highs. And he can play multiple positions. \nEdge: Push \nMETS 2015 NLDS PREVIEW : 5 Mets the Los Angeles Dodgers fear in the NLDS \nLeft field \nMets: The Mets will go with a platoon, with Michael Conforto and Michael Cuddyer both receiving starts based on pitching matchups. The left-handed hitting Conforto will likely start against righties and impressed in his rookie season, batting .270 with nine homers and 26 RBI in 56 major-league games. Cuddyer will start against lefties. \nDodgers: Veteran Carl Crawford hasn't been able to match the offensive success he experienced with the Tampa Bay Rays earlier in his career since joining the Dodgers. Crawford, 34, spent time on the 60-day disabled list this season and finished the regular-season with a .265 batting average, four homers and 16 RBI in 69 games. \nEdge: Mets \nCenterfield \nMets: Since joining the Mets at the trade deadline, Yoenis Cespedes has been an invaluable acquisition, helping transform their once woeful offense by hitting .287 with 17 homers and 44 RBI in 57 games with New York. He's also a superb defender with a cannon for an arm and also provides speed on the base paths. \nDodgers: Enrique Hernandez began the season as a super utility man for the Dodgers, but took over the starting role in center field when Joc Pederson began to struggle after the All-Star break. Hernandez batted .307 with seven home runs and 22 RBI in 76 games but has recently been bothered by a hamstring injury. \nEdge: Mets \nRight field \nMets: Curtis Granderson was one of the Mets' MVPs. As the Mets' leadoff hitter, Granderson batted .259 with a .821 OPS, 26 homers and 70 RBI. While pretty much the entire lineup varied from really bad to really good, Granderson was consistent. He was the metronome to spark their offense. \nDodgers: Andre Ethier enjoyed another solid season with the Dodgers and gave Adrian Gonzalez help in the lineup. He raked against right-handed pitching, hitting all 14 of his home runs and posting a .900 OPS. The Dodgers could use Yasiel Puig here to against lefties, if he's healthy, which he really hasn't been lately. \nEdge: Mets \nStarting Rotation \nMets: Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey -- it's tough to top that top three. In fact, no team in baseball may able too. The only criticism of the Mets staff is that they have no playoff experience but with that kind of stuff, who cares. Steven Matz is in line to pitch Game 4 unless deGrom comes back on short rest. \nDodgers: Clayton Kershaw. Zack Greinke. Clayton Kershaw. Zack Greinke. Clayton Kershaw. Zack Greinke. Clayton Kershaw. Zack Greinke. Clayton Kershaw. Zack Greinke. Clayton Kershaw. Zack Greinke. Get all that? They'll probably end up starting four games if this series goes five. \nEdge: Dodgers \nBench \nMets: The Mets have options here, although it hurts for them to lose Juan Uribe. Cuddyer and Conforto will split time here. Nieuwenhuis offers lefty power. Juan Lagares may be the best defensive replacement in baseball and can hit left-handed pitching. Kelly Johnson and Kevin Plawecki could see some at-bats too. \nDodgers: This is a rag-tag group. The Dodgers traded for Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley, hoping the veterans could provide consistency and experience. Instead they've struggled and can't maintain regular playing time. Scott Van Slyke is dangerous against right-handed pitching. \nEdge: Mets \nBullpen \nMets: Jeurys Familia blossomed into one of the best closers in baseball, with filthy stuff that can seem almost unhittable at times. The Mets also traded for help to bridge the gap to him. Addison Reed and Tyler Clippard give them much-needed reliable arms in the late innings. \nDodgers: The Dodgers' bullpen was middle of the road, ranking 19th in baseball in ERA. Closer Kenley Jansen was strong, however. He had a 2.41 ERA, 0.78 WHIP and 36 saves. But the Mets have already gotten to him once this year. L.A. has to hope their starters go deep into games. \nEdge: Mets \nManager \nMets: Terry Collins has had to endure a lot this year as the Mets manager while he waited out for help for the roster. But now he's seen as a manager of the year candidate and will probably become a media darling. His late-game tactics are sometimes questionable. \nDodgers: Don Mattingly has seemingly be on the hot seat his entire term in Los Angeles. But the Dodgers won the West again under his watch. Does that mean his job is safe? Who knows. His biggest help this year may have been soothing David Wright's worries about his back. \nEdge: Mets \nPrediction : It's playoff baseball, who really knows. But the Mets seem to have more depth in their lineup and their roster, despite the oodles and oodles of money the Dodgers have spent. And Game 3 could be a turning point with Matt Harvey on the mound. Mets in 5. \n-- Staff writer Maria Guardado contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:11:36.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
