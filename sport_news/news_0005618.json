The Mets have already clinched the NL East.\nCespedes was struck by an 89 mph fastball from Justin De Fratus of the Phillies. The Mets outfielder dropped the bat, shook his hand and fell to the dirt in the batter's box.\nMets manager Terry Collins and a trainer rushed from the dugout, and Cespedes left.\nAcquired at the July 31 trade deadline from Detroit, Cespedes is batting .287 with 17 homers and 44 RBIs in 54 games with the Mets. Overall, he has set career highs this season with 35 home runs and 105 RBIs.\nMany of the large contingent of Mets fans in attendance booed De Fratus.
