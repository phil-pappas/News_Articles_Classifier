A 64-yard touchdown run by Trace Lingo and a 58-yard touchdown connection between Keith Stewart and Bryar Cox. \nThe Black Bears went into the half down 6-0, but the 58-yard touchdown connection of Cox and Stewart gave them a 7-6 lead. That score carried into the fourth quarter, before Lingo's touchdown gave River View some cushion. \nClaimant would score in the four, but fail on its two-point conversion and then turn the ball over on downs on it's final possession. \nStewart finished 8-15 for 106 yards with a touchdown and interception. \nCasey Turnbull led the Black Bears with four solo tackles and three assisted tackles, while Lingo also recovered a fumble.
