(Photo: Submitted photo) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nUSA Boxing has a fighter at the youth level that could be exactly what boxing has been praying for since Mike Tyson was dethroned as the sport’s king in the 1990s —a world-class heavyweight fighter could do wonders for the sport in this country. \nHowever, this promising 16-year-old boxer also wants to pursue an engineering career — Tulare’s Richard Torrez Jr. \nIn terms of his boxing credentials, it’s quite obvious that Torrez has a very bright future. \nTorrez, a two-time U.S. junior national champion, is the No. 1-ranked boxer in the United States for the junior heavyweight division (15-16-year-olds) according to USA Boxing. \nHe’s also among the best in the world. \nTorrez took fifth place in the heavyweight division at the AIBA Junior World Boxing Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, last month. \n“It was an amazing experience. I was just ecstatic to be there,” Torrez said. “I was really happy to have this opportunity. I’m very happy to have participated in this event.” \nTorrez opened the tournament with two impressive wins via technical knockouts delivered in the first round. He lost a close 3-0 quarterfinal decision to Azerbaijan’s Mahammad Abdullayev, who went on to win the junior world heavyweight title. \n“I really think this made a big impression on him,” Richard Torrez Sr., his father and the area’s long-time boxing guru, said. “This is the Junior World Championships; basically, it’s the Olympics for his age group. ...Being in that kind of setting made a big impact with him.” \nIt made a childhood dream of his become a realistic goal — a pursuit of Olympic glory. \n“Ever since I put on the gloves for the first time when I was four, I wanted to go to the Olympics,” Torrez Jr. said. “I’ve always had that dream. And now I really want to follow that dream.” \nHe’s also pursuing a noble dream out of the ring — a career in engineering. \nTorrez, a junior at Mission Oak High School, owns a grade point average above 4.0 and is taking an Advanced Placement Calculus class this school year along with other college preparatory classes. \n“My goal is to finish college and become an electronic engineer,” Torrez said. “My parents have really emphasized a college education, and the value of having one in life. I want electronic engineering to be my profession when my boxing career ends.” \nTorrez Sr., a decorated amateur boxer who nearly made a couple of U.S. Olympic teams in the 1980s, does not hesitate when it comes to his thoughts on what should be his son’s top priority. \n“College is first and foremost,” Torrez Sr. said. “I know guys who went on to world titles, but don’t end up very well (financially). They didn’t save their money, or they didn’t have a plan for life after boxing. College is going to be No. 1 for my son. When It comes to boxing, we’ll sit down every year and reevaluate his goals. We’ll take it year by year. And after he’s done with school, and if he still has a love for the sport, we’ll see how it goes.” \nTaking part on the sport’s international stage has only whetted the young Torrez’s appetite for boxing. \nHe wants to chase that Olympic dream. \n“I’m looking at the 2020 Olympics as my shot,” Torrez Jr. said. “Talking to all the coaches in USA Boxing, and looking at the possible [U.S.] team, I think I have a shot at it. I want to throw my hat in the ring for that opportunity.” \nThat would be quite a remarkable story — Torrez in the midst of pursing a engineering degree while preparing to go to Tokyo with the U.S. Olympic team. \nTorrez’s next major boxing tournament is the 2016 USA Boxing Youth National Championships in January in Reno, where he will be moving up to the 17-18-year-old division. \nGoing up in age class will expose Torrez to whole new set of boxers, several of whom have a vast amount of experience in national Golden Gloves competitions. \nAnd that is where Torrez may find his biggest challenge to earning a spot on the 2020 U.S. Olympic boxing team — garnering the necessary experience and time in the ring to become a viable Olympic hopeful. \nTorrez has fought in 35 amateur bouts. His father had 160 amateur fights under his belt at 16 years old. \n“I know he doesn’t have a lot of experience compared to some, but he’s right on track for his age,” Torrez Sr. said. “We’ll be able to get some sparring in against some top-flight amateurs. We just need to find the right guys, find the right coaches, and as times goes on, just work harder and harder. We’re going to get there.” \nIn order to get there, Torrez knows he needs to make some changes with his schedule. \n“One of the toughest decisions I have right now is that if I want to continue to box, I kind of have to focus on it,” Torrez said. “I’m still up in the air right now about a few things, but I think I have to start focusing more and more on boxing in the future.” \nComplicating matters for Torrez is that he’s one of the better athletes on the Mission Oak campus. \nTorrez is an integral part of the Hawks football team as a fullback/H-back/linebacker. \n“When I was in Russia, I was always texting Jaden (Enriquez) to see how we did in the game. I missed football when I was there. I love the sport of football,” Torrez said. \nWhen Torrez returned from the Junior World Championships, he didn’t waste any time making an impact for the Hawks on the gridiron. During Mission Oak’s 34-30 win over Mt. Whitney on Sept. 18, Torrez picked up a first down on a fourth-down play that allowed the Hawks’ winning drive to continue. \nTorrez was also on the 2014-15 Mission Oak boys basketball team that finished as the Central Section Division II runner-up. \nWhatever Torrez opts to do over the next couple of years, it doesn’t change his two primary goals: Being accepted to one of his schools of choice, and continuing to thrive at the youth level in USA Boxing. \n“I’m pretty blessed that I have the opportunity to be able to go to college and pursue an engineering degree, and also to be an athlete, and pursue my dream in boxing,” Torrez said. \n“I feel like I just have to keep going down my path. I’m just going to go for it.” Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1FKfO28 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:24:34.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
