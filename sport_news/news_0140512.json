Death by gunfire, at one's own hand or at another's, is a particular horror among the many.\nThe topic is fueling political debate nationally once more following the deadly Oct. 1 mass shooting at Oregon's Umpqua Community College.\nUnderstanding the issue of gun deaths is impossible without some basic facts. How many people die by gunfire? How does that compare with other causes of death? How many gun deaths are homicides and how many are suicides?\nWe compiled data on all deaths for 2013 from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We drilled down especially deep on fatal injuries, of which suicides and homicides are one component.\nClick for larger image\nBecause words matter when describing numbers, here are some notes from the terminology the CDC uses for fatal injuries.\nThe leading federal public health agency divides the manner of injury deaths into \"unintentional,\" \"violence-related\" and \"undetermined intent.\" Homicide or suicide by any method comprise the \"violence-related\" category.\nWhether or not violence accurately describes suicide is a matter of opinion. It is the term CDC uses. Another word for \"violence-related\" might be \"intentional.\"\nWe used the neutral term \"guns\" in this infographic when lumping together homicides and suicides by gun. We used the term \"non-gun violence\" when referring to other suicides and homicides, simply because the more precise term \"non-gun homicides and suicides\" would not fit in the graphic.\nFinally, we included in this chart the number of victims in mass shootings for 2013 using data compiled by the crowdsourced site shootingtracker.com .\nOf the many mass shooting lists widely cited this year, shootingtracker uses one of the broadest definitions of a mass shooting: a discharge of gunfire with four or more people struck by bullets, whether killed or injured.\nThe site lists fatalities in its data but does not differentiate between the shooter and the shooter's victims. So our estimate of 502 deaths in mass shootings undoubtedly overstates the number of homicides in mass shootings.\nThis very rough, upper end of possible estimates would put mass shootings deaths at about 4 percent of U.S. gun homicides in 2013.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive's data team will be providing more data in coming days concerning guns and gun deaths. Stay tuned.\n-- Steve Suo\n-- Infographic by Mark Graves", "external_links": ["http://www.shootingtracker.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:23:53.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
