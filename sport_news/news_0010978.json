However, with a home run like the one Kyle Schwarber hit, it’s a little hard to overreact.\nIn the seventh inning, Schwarber hit a ball so far down the right field line that it ended up landing on top of the right field scoreboard.\nEven with a shot of that magnitude, the internet wizards were still able to have some fun.\nKyle Schwarber killed an astronaut This is phenomenal https://t.co/27EJxO1bw5\n— Stan (@Crewsett) October 14, 2015\nHere is the projected landing spot of that Kyle Schwarber home run: pic.twitter.com/zIiD2AUmJS\n— CBS Sports (@CBSSports) October 13, 2015\nThe Oakland A’s found Schwarber’s ball . @kschwarb12 's home run just landed… in Oakland. @Cubs @MLB https://t.co/62SVMxsQ9H\n— Oakland Athletics (@Athletics) October 13, 2015\nSchwarber’s home run nearly killed Scott Van Pelt during his highlights Sorry @BarstoolBigCat but @notthefakeSVP just took the crown for best yabo call pic.twitter.com/XDZLXikmar\n— Mike S.

In the Wild Card game, Schwarber told team president Theo Epstein to get a kayak because he was going to hit the ball in the river. Then he did.\nTuesday night, Schwarber told center fielder Dexter Fowler he was going to hit a home run against the Cardinals pitcher. Then that happened.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Athletics/status/654075018222116864", "https://twitter.com/BigMikeS_/status/654146762509262848", "https://twitter.com/BarstoolBigCat", "https://twitter.com/CBSSports/status/654070917606326272", "https://t.co/27EJxO1bw5", "https://twitter.com/MLB", "https://twitter.com/Cubs", "https://t.co/62SVMxsQ9H", "http://t.co/XDZLXikmar", "https://twitter.com/kschwarb12", "https://twitter.com/notthefakeSVP", "https://twitter.com/Crewsett/status/654092134816030720", "http://t.co/zIiD2AUmJS"], "published": "2015-10-14T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:12:52.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
