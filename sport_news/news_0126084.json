Astros gain edge on Keuchel's win 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Houston\nDallas Keuchel remained perfect at home with seven gutsy innings and Chris Carter homered Sunday, leading the Houston Astros to a 4-2 win over the Kansas City Royals to take a 2-1 lead in the American League Division Series.\nThe Astros could wrap up the best-of-five series with a win over the defending AL champions in Game 4 on Monday.\nKeuchel, who shut down the Yankees in the AL wild-card game, worked out of jam after jam, allowing five hits and one run with seven strikeouts after going 15-0 at home this season, a modern major-league record.\nLuke Gregerson gave up a leadoff homer in the ninth to Alex Gordon before finishing off the Astros' first playoff game in Houston in 10 years with a four-out save. It was his first save of more than three outs in three years.\nJason Castro drove in two runs with a single in the fifth that made it 2-1. Carlos Gomez, who has a rib muscle strain, started for the first time in the series and had an RBI single in the sixth.\nCarter's soaring solo homer, which came on Danny Duffy's first pitch of the seventh pushed the lead to 4-1.\nCarter, batting .199 in the regular season but .455 in the postseason, was a triple shy of the cycle for the Astros, who were hosting a playoff game for the first time since the 2005 World Series.\nLorenzo Cain hit a solo homer in the fourth for the Royals, who reached the World Series last season.\nKansas City starter Edinson Volquez fell to 0-3 in his postseason career by allowing five hits and three runs in 52/3 innings.\nThe Astros are one win away from reaching the AL Championship Series just two years after losing a franchise-worst 111 games.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/43/8775892/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/43/8775892/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:08:28.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
