(Photo: Andrew Pekarek/Press-Gazette Media) Buy Photo \nIt doesn’t take long to figure out how Jamar Brown got his nickname. \nWhen you watch the Green Bay West senior on the football field you can quickly come to the understanding of why his teammates call him “Scoots.” \nThe 5-foot-5, 155-pounder’s shifty footwork makes him an elusive target to tackle. \nBrown showcased that ability during the Wildcats’ 49-6 homecoming victory over New London last Friday. Despite battling an ankle injury, the West running back couldn’t be slowed down in rushing for 271 yards and scoring six touchdowns overall in the win. \nBrown, who is averaging 8.3 yards per carry this season, also has displayed his speed on the track. He was a leg on the Wildcats’ 800-meter relay team, which broke a school record and advanced to the WIAA Division 1 sectionals in the spring. \nBrown discusses his quick moves, Jay Cutler and tattoos in this week’s senior spotlight. \nDescribe how it felt to get a 49-6 victory over New London in your homecoming game last Friday. \nIt was up for grabs. Going into the game we were confident we were going to win. It just led to more confidence during the game. \nWhat was your favorite play from that game? \nThe first time I touched the ball on punt return. I had a bad ankle. They hit it while I was running. I was running almost to the end zone and was limping. One of my teammates (Lane Olson) saw a dude coming up behind me that was going to get me, but he gave up his body for me to score. \nI got an opportunity to walk through your school while it was being decorated for homecoming week. How does it feel to receive so much support from your classmates? \nIt’s unbelievable. Even though we’re not a winning team, they still come and support every Friday, home or away. They support us win or lose. \nWhat’s your earliest memory of playing football? \nMy older brother, he is five years older than me, was always bigger than me. I used to play with him and his friends. I was only like so little. I didn’t want to get hit, so I did everything I could not to get hit. \nWhat’s your most embarrassing moment playing football? \nIn sixth grade, we were playing a game here at West. We were playing our rivals, the Wolverines, and there was like 25 seconds left in the game. I had broken away for a run, and I’m excited because we’re going to win. Then the ball hit my thigh, and I fumbled it. We recovered it, but then we threw an interception and lost the game. \nHave you made a more conscious effort to protect the football since then? \nThat was one of my goals coming into this year, not fumbling the whole season. It’s working so far. \nDo any of your tattoos have a special meaning to you? \nI got my mom’s name under my arm. She taught me never to quit. Growing up, it has been hard. There have been struggles. But she never gives up on us. That’s what I learned from my mom — never give up on something you want to do. \nDo you have a career you’re interested in pursuing? \nI want to go to college. I want to go for criminal justice and work with kids with disabilities. Buy Photo \nGreen Bay West senior Jamar Brown.

What were those experiences like? \nHe actually knew my name. The coaches probably told him that, but it was something I’ll remember for the rest of my life. He told me some stuff that will help me in the future. It was cool how he donated us money for equipment and stuff. \nWhat’s your favorite college or professional team? \nEverybody is going to hate me for this, but I’m going to have to say the (Chicago) Bears. I was born in Chicago, and I lived there until I was 5. It was just a natural thing. \nWho is your favorite Bears player? \nMatt Forte. It was (Brian) Urlacher when he was the face of the defense back then. \nDo you think quarterback Jay Cutler should be benched? \nYeah, most definitely. \nWhat rule change would you make to high school football? \nThere should be a weight limit to carry the ball, maybe at 200 pounds. That’s kind of big for high school, so it would be nice. \nWhat would you change about school? \nLess homework. But seriously, I don’t think I would change anything about our school. \nWho on the team could survive on a deserted island? \nTyler Chanthavong. He doesn’t take no for an answer. He would do anything he needs to do to get where he wants to go. \nWhich teammate would you take on a road trip across the country with? \nAustin Williquette and Travis Robinson. Austin, I’ve grown up with him since day care. Travis and me went on a trip to Minnesota for a football camp, and the ride there and back was fun. \nWho is the messiest person on the team? \nDemaggio Kane. The way he eats, he goes head first. His room is kind of messy, too. He’s got to clean up before we come over. \nWhich teammate should have their own reality TV show? \nKevin Franklin. He’s a comedian. If you need to laugh, call Kevin. \nFavorites", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:50:32.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
