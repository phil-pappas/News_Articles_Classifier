Coach Jim McElwain said on the SEC coaches teleconference call that Porter “was no longer with the football team.” \n“It’s his choice not to be with us,” McElwain said. “It’s one of those things that we don’t obviously condone. Like I said, it was his choice.” \nPorter, who was switched to defense after being an all-state quarterback at Tampa Jefferson, red-shirted last year and was playing special teams this season, with two tackles in four games. \nPorter led the state with 53 touchdowns passing and running and 4,698 yards of total offense as a senior at Jefferson in 2013. He threw for 33 touchdowns and 3,199 yards and scored 20 touchdowns and rushed for 1,499 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:10:57.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
