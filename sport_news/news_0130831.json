The eight players have not been named.\nThe women’s team plays in hijab headscarves, long-sleeved jerseys and tracksuit pants.\nThis is not the first time the team has been involved in a gender scandal.\nLast year, four national team players were found to be either men who had not completed sex change operations or were suffering from sexual development disorders. In 2010, the gender of the team’s goalkeeper was called into question.\nSex change operations have been legal in Iran since 1979, when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious ruling, or fatwa, giving them the go-ahead. The law is in stark contrast to the Islamic republic’s strict rules around homosexuality and premarital sex.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email This article originally appeared on News.com.au .\nFiled under iran soccer ,  sex change ,  soccer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:44:26.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
