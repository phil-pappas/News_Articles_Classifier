Both for first downs. After a long gainer on a screen to Danny Woodhead into the red zone, quarterback Philip Rivers again looked for No. 85.\nGates ran an out route into the left corner of the end zone and gathered in the 12-yard pass for his 100th career touchdown.\nIt was the 73rd scoring pass from Rivers. Gates’ three receptions went for 34 yards on the drive that gave the Chargers a 7-0 lead 9:50 into the game.\nGates later caught an 11-yard pass for a touchdown from Rivers to put the Chargers ahead 17-10 with 8:02 left in the fourth quarter.\n“I’ve never had any expectations in terms of what I was going to do going into the game,” Gates said. “All I wanted to do was contribute and I was able to do as much as I could when the opportunities presented themselves.”\nGates, finally beginning his 13th season, finished with nine catches for 92 yards and those two touchdowns. He passed Tim Brown and Steve Largent for seventh on the all-time touchdown receptions list and is second only to Tony Gonzalez among tight ends. He now has 797 receptions and 101 TDs.\nHe and Rivers are the No. 1 TE-QB combo in NFL history with 74 TDs.\n“You saw the production he had, what he did, what he brings to this football team,” Chargers coach Mike McCoy said. “It was outstanding to have him back.”\nDEFENSIVE WOES\nHow well the Chargers defense could contain the run was one of the subplots entering the game. The Chargers came in with the league’s 29th-ranked run defense and allowed 155 yards on the ground and 203 yards passing by Steelers quarterback Michael Vick. But it was Vick’s legs that kept the Steelers’ hopes alive late.\nOn third-and-6 with 36 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Vick scrambled up the middle 24 yards to the Chargers’ 17. Two plays later he passed to tight end Heath Miller to the 1.\nOn the next play, with :05 on the clock, Le’Veon Bell took a wildcat snap and dragged Chargers linebacker Donald Butler just enough to reach the end zone. The play warranted a review to determine when his knee hit the ground before referee Pete Morelli confirmed what appeared true on the video board: Touchdown. Game over.\nButler said he started the play on the backside and had to go through a Steelers guard to grab onto Bell’s legs. Butler said he didn’t know if he had made a game-saving play.\n“I wasn’t sure,” he said. “I tried to get him down. ... It looked like we had him stopped and he was able to just squeeze by.”\n“Talk about a game of inches,” Rivers said. “It was just that.”\nBell ended with 111 yards on 21 carries and the Steelers gained 155 on 27 carries, a 5.7 average.\nButler said he wasn’t surprised that Steelers coach Mike Tomlin went for the touchdown instead of a field goal that would have forced overtime.\n“Not that coach,” Butler said.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw59pg-b88534960z.120151012225152000g9vci4fm.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw59pg-b88534960z.120151012225152000g9vci4fm.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:14:22.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
