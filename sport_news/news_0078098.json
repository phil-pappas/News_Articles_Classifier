Again. Last year, a loss to Auburn kept the Indians from winning the NIC-10 title outright, but they dominated the Knights in the first round of the Class 7A playoffs. This year, four missed kicks and a defensive touchdown on the last play of the half in a 7-6 loss to Auburn kept Hononegah from forging a three-way tie for the NIC-10 title, but it once again drew Auburn (8-1) when the first-round playoff matchups were announced Saturday. “I am frustrated not to have somebody new to play,” Auburn coach Dan Appino said. “Our fans have been waiting 50 years for a playoff game at home and our fans are going to see another NIC-10 team that they see every year.” The matchup, though, thrills Hononegah (6-3). “I give Auburn all the kudos for having a great season and they played us very tough,” Hononegah co-interim coach Brian Zimmerman said, “but I would absolutely love to go back in there and replay that game. They were the No. 1 team and we played them so tough.” So tough describes Belvidere’s draw. The Bucs (6-3) have given a couple of No. 1 seeds tough games in recent years when they went into the 5A playoffs at 5-4. An extra win was supposed to give the Bucs an easier draw. Instead, they play No. 8-ranked Woodstock Marian (7-2) in the first round, with Joliet Catholic and its record 13 straight state titles looming in the second round. Class 7A was seeded 1-32, and Harlem (7-2) was sent to the lower bracket against Blue Island Eisenhower (7-2). The Huskies couldn’t meet Auburn or Hononegah before the state finals. “We’re excited about our draw,” coach Jim Morrow said. “We think we match up well from the limited footage we can find on the Internet.” In 6A, Belvidere North (6-3) is at Maple Park Kaneland (6-3). In 4A, Lutheran (9-0) opens against a Dixon team it beat 95-28. The Big Northern West champs would then get probable second- and third-round games against BNC East powers Richmond-Burton (8-1) and Marengo (9-0) before a potential semifinal date with Chicago Phillips (9-0), the team it lost to last year in the final seconds. In 3A, Byron (7-2) hosts Lisle (7-2) and Winnebago (5-4) is at Elmhurst IC Catholic (8-1), a team that won the 2A state title in 2008 but has won one playoff game in six years since moving to 3A. In 2A, Christian Life (5-4) is at Kewanee Wethersfield (8-1) and West Carroll (5-4) is at Downs Tri-Valley (9-0). In Class 1A, No. 4-ranked Polo (9-0) has a nice draw the first two rounds, but the other NUIC teams have killer draws. Forreston (7-2) is ranked No. 10 in the latest poll, but opens at No. 5 Dakota (7-2). Next would be No. 2 Toulon Stark County (9-0), probably followed by Polo and No. 1 Lena-Winslow (9-0). And Le-Win could face Orion, ranked No. 6 in 2A, in the second round. Orion has made the playoffs 11 times in 14 years, all in 2A or 3A before. Page 2 of 2 - “It’s a tough draw, but we can’t look ahead,” Dakota coach Rick Schmitz said. “It’s the playoffs. Let’s go. Sometimes if you want to get somewhere, you have to go through the toughest.” Local first-round 1A matchups are: Forreston at Dakota, Elgin Westminster Christian (6-3) at Polo, Warren (6-3) at Chicago Hope (8-1), Stockton (7-2) at Galena (7-2) and Princeville (5-4) at Le-Win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:58:56.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
