Sources added that the special branch had given its report to the department, but it is said to have not had any mention of a threat to Kulkarni.\nSpeaking to dna, former Mumbai police commissioner MN Singh said, \"I think it's a slip-up from the police. It does not require much intelligence to gauge such threat perceptions, it's just basic policing. If the Shiv Sena was against the book launch, then (it's obvious that) the organisers too would be under threat; they (the police) could have provided some basic cover.\"\n\"This is a complete failure on part of the police. They should have anticipated the attack on Kulkarni and prevented it,\" said IPS officer-turned-lawyer YP Singh.\nThe Antop Hill police station on Monday registered an FIR against unidentified people for blackening Kulkarni's face. The case has been registered under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 147 (rioting), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) among others.\n\"We have registered an FIR against unknown people and have started the investigation; we are trying to ascertain the identity of the accused,\" said deputy commissioner of police Dhananjay Kulkarni.\nWhen contacted, additional commissioner of police (south region) Pratap Dighavkar, who also holds additional charge of special branch of Mumbai police, said, \"I would not want to comment on the issue as I was on leave for 10 days and have just resumed work today.\"\nMessages were sent to police commissioner Ahmad Javed, asking whether the police had provided security cover to Kulkarni prior to the incident, but he did not respond. Joint commissioner of police (law and order) Deven Bharti too did not respond to repeated calls and messages.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/114015587344367473764/posts"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:22:06.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
