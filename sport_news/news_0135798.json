Randall Cobb is limited with a right shoulder injury. \nAdd James Jones to the injury list this week with a sore hamstring. He was limited in practice for a second straight day as the Packers prepared for Sunday's game against the visiting St. Louis Rams. \nAn easygoing veteran, Jones brushed away any concern after practice Thursday. \n\"Ain't nobody limpin', man. I'll be all right,\" Jones said. \nEverybody plays hurt on Sundays, he added. \n\"You never feel good after the first day of training camp. I'll be fine,\" he said. \nJones was signed by the Packers the week of the season opener after being cut by the New York Giants. With 17 catches for 317 yards and four touchdowns, Jones has capably filled the void left by Jordy Nelson's season-ending right knee injury in the second preseason game. \nWhat Jones hasn't quite replaced is the threat that Nelson provided on deep passing routes. \nAt tight end, Andrew Quarless is out for at least another seven weeks with a sprained left MCL. \nQuarless had lost his starting job to Richard Rodgers. Still, Quarless provided quarterback Aaron Rodgers with another veteran receiving option and blocker. \nQuarless, who is on injured reserve/designated to return, would be eligible to play again in Week 12 on Thanksgiving night against the Chicago Bears. He's encouraged by a recent conversation he had with player personnel director Eliot Wolf. \n\"Sometimes with injuries, guys tend to rush things and reinjure themselves,\" Quarless said. \"One of his main things was, 'take your time, get healed and we'll be ready for you to come back.'\" \nProduction is coming from other areas. \nRichard Rodgers is turning into a viable receiving option with two touchdown catches. \nRookie Ty Montgomery has played well so far in seeing more snaps with Adams sidelined. The running game is averaging 136 yards a game, and backs Eddie Lacy and James Starks are effective check-down options. \nThe constant through the turnover is Aaron Rodgers. The MVP quarterback has thrown for 11 touchdowns and no interceptions through the first four games. \n\"So he just does all of the little things right. And when you have a program, your best players have to be your best people,\" coach Mike McCarthy said. \"He makes people around him better.\" \nNOTES: Starting RT Bryan Bulaga was limited for a second straight day in his return from a left knee injury. Position coach James Campen said Bulaga looked good, though no decision has been made on Bulaga's availability for Sunday. ... LB Clay Matthews (quad) was limited. ... S Morgan Burnett (calf) missed practice again. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:31:18.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
