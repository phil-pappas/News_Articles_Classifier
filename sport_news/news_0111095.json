Junior Mayv Clune also scored and assisted on Pearce’s goal. \nDespite the three-goal loss, Spartans coach Adrienne Searfoss couldn’t have asked for more from her team. \n“They did everything I asked of them,” an emotional Searfoss said. “I couldn’t be prouder. That’s the best we’ve played all year. They gave 100 percent.” \nMoravian coach Debbie Bross again gave props to her stout midfield trio of Persin, Cecily Redfern and Vivian Simone . \n“The midfielders played great, and we have a solid defense behind us,” Bross said. \nBross sensed her team was in the driver’s seat when Pearce broke the scoreless tie. \n“Our A.D. (athletic director Manny Oudin) came up to me and said ‘Once we put one in, we got this,”’ Bross said. “It was just a matter of time. We felt pretty secure.” \nEven when Moravian scored, Searfoss felt her defenders were in excellent position. \n“We were right on people,” Searfoss said. “Those goals they scored, they were legit goals.” \nAccording to Persin, it was Moravian’s only loss of the season, last Friday’s 3-2 setback at Whitehall, that helped prepare the team for this tournament. \n“That (loss) hurt a lot because wanted to go undefeated,” Persin said, “but we needed to play that game because it was on turf and it helped prepare us for this turf field (at Salisbury). I think that was the first time we played on turf all year. But that loss helped us win this game.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @TomHinkelLV .
