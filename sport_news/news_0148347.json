New superheroes are springing into action to save Brooklyn.\nEisner-award winning Dean Haspiel and other artists are creating comic superheroes with Brooklyn roots. Their adventures start this coming March in the LINE Webtoons website.\nIn what is called the New Brooklyn universe, heroes must rise to fight villains in an alternate world where the borough is a sentient entity that separates itself from the New York state.\n“The idea was what if we incorporated Brooklyn as a character. Not only a character because it’s a city, but it actually has a beating heart. And what if Brooklyn’s heart got broken and decides to secede the boroughs,” Haspiel said.\nBrooklyn and its residents as a result of this become self-sustaining. It returns back to a barter system, growing its own food and also giving rise to its own heroes.\nNew Brooklyn comics teaser for Webtoons. One of those heroes is Red Hook, created by Haspiel. The Purple Heart web toon, by Vito Delsante and Ricardo Venanco. The Brooklynite web toon, by Seth Kushner and Shamus Beyale. Previous Next Enlarge LINE Webtoon/LINE Webtoon The New Brooklyn comics teaser, featuring superheroes: The Red Hook, Purple Heart, and The Brooklynite. One of those heroes is Red Hook, created by Haspiel who has lived in Brooklyn for 18 years.\nInspired by the gritty history of the neighborhood with the same name as well as the works of legendary artists Jack Kirby and Alex Toth, the “Red Hook” comic will tell the story of a thief turned reluctant hero when given unexpected powers.\nIn addition to Red Hook, two new heroes will emerge to defend the residents of New Brooklyn in their own comics.\nBrooklynite, which was co-created by Seth Kushner and Shamus Beyale, is Kushner’s last superhero work. He passed away earlier this year after his fight with cancer.\n“I’ll be working with the editor and the artist to make sure we keep true to the source material and be able to deliver the Brooklynite as close to [Kushner’s] co-vision with the artist,” Haspiel said.\nBrooklyn-born Kushner played a major part in sparking the creation this universe. Haspiel and Kushner had actually developed Red Hook and Brooklynite separately and wanted to find a way to bring them together.\nIn the end, they came up with the idea of a sentient Brooklyn that pays homage to the borough they both have a strong relationship with and inspired these characters.\n“This is kind of like a love letter to Brooklyn, what I’m doing,” Haspiel said.\nRelated Stories COMIC ARTIST HAS SERIOUS MISSION Harvey Pekar, writer of 'American Splendor' comic books, dead at 70 'The Green Hornet' to the rescue!
