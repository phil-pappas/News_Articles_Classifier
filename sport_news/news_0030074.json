The workload prepared Cleland, now a junior, for what he could be facing this year now that Pesce has departed for the pros. The University of New Hampshire hockey team returns seven defensemen with varying degrees of experience, and how they perform in front of sophomore goaltenders Danny Tirone and Adam Clark could be one of the keys to the season. \"When (Pesce) went down somebody had to step up and I got some minutes,\" Cleland said. \"I think it's going to help me a lot for this year and knowing what to expect.\" Cleland will anchor a blue-line group that includes one senior, two juniors and four sophomores. UNH also brought in defenseman Matt Dawson as part of six-member freshman class. \"I'm definitely expecting a lot out of myself this year,\" Cleland said. \"I definitely want to be the leader back there.\" Sophomore Cameron Marks was the only defenseman to play in all 40 games last season. Cleland played in 39 of 40 games in 2014-15, sophomore John Furgele played in 36 and senior Harry Quast appeared in 31. \"I'm confident that some of the sophomores are going to step up and be big-time for us,\" Cleland said. Sophomore Richard Boyd dressed for 24 games last year and junior Dylan Maller was limited to 22 because of a foot injury, although he did play in 20 his freshman year after joining the team at midseason. Cleland, who led UNH defensemen with six goals and 18 points last season, and Marks could be the Wildcats' top pairing, although it's not a given. \"Cleland played a lot when Pesce went down,\" said coach Dick Umile. \"He played Pesce's minutes, and I thought he became a solid defenseman for us. \"They're a good group,\" Umile added. \"They're going to see some minutes. All the roles have changed.\" UNH opens the season Saturday night (7) at home against American International College. The Wildcats are coming off a 6-4 win over St. Francis Xavier on Sunday in an exhibition. They rallied from a 4-1 deficit with four goals in the third period. \"I don't think we want to be down like that,\" said senior captain Collin MacDonald, \"but I think we took something out of the first period for sure.\" \"Being down 4-1 and coming back showed some resilience,\" Cleland said. \"Obviously it's only an exhibition, but it kind of showed some of the firepower we have up front and that our team can put the puck in the net.\" Now the games matter. UNH finished 19-19-2 last season and knocked off eventual national champion Providence in the playoffs to reach the Hockey East semifinals for the second year in a row. However, the Wildcats missed the NCAA Tournament in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991. \"I think we're going to be a good team if we can keep getting better each week,\" Umile said. \"We're determined to get off to a good start.\" \"The past two years we've gotten off slow,\" Cleland said, \"and it's come back to bite us in the end. We definitely know it's a year-round thing and the start's really important.\" Up front, the Wildcats return junior Tyler Kelleher, who led the team in assists (24) and points (42) last year, and sophomore Andrew Poturalski, who is coming off a solid rookie campaign. He was fourth on the team in goals (14) and points (29). Kelleher and Poturalski will likely play together on the first line. \"We're going to expect a lot from (Kelleher),\" Umile said. \"He's a goal scorer. He's always been a goal scorer. I think those two play off each other well.\" Senior forward Dan Correale, and sophomores Warren Foegele and Shane Eiserman will be asked to step up their offensive production as the Wildcats lost three of their top five scorers from a year ago. Freshmen forwards Marcus Vela and Ara Nazarian have shown promise early. Eiserman scored twice against St. Francis and Vela had three assists. UNH won nine of its last 11 games last year, including an eight-game win streak. \"We definitely remember how we finished last season,\" Cleland said. \"It seemed like we were firing on all cylinders. That's the way we need to start.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:30:14.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
