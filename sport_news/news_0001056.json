First, you make a compelling case for additional revenue. Next, if possible, you propose a tax that someone else will pay. To that end, it helps to create an \"other,\" as they say, an unsympathetic and perhaps even malevolent entity that not only can afford higher taxes, but also deserves them. More money and justice, all in one vote!\nThere's a reason Our Oregon, the political arm of the state's public employees unions , had little trouble convincing voters to abolish the corporate \"kicker\" in 2012 but hasn't taken on the personal income-tax \"kicker.\" It's easy to argue, as one union official did in the Voters' Pamphlet , that \"We can't continue giving out-of-state corporations an unexpected windfall.\" It's less productive to lecture Oregonians about their own unexpected windfalls. The big — and preferably out-of-state — corporation is Our Oregon's favorite \"other.\"\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

These days, public employees unions and affiliated groups are using the \"punish the other\" strategy to sell a massive tax hike that might end up on the November 2016 ballot. It would fundamentally alter the state's corporate tax structure, raising taxes by billions of dollars per year. Problem is, you may find yourself among the \"others\" helping to hold the bag. Oregonians who'd hesitate to raise their own taxes this much should think twice before supporting Initiative Petition 28 .\nC-corporations, the companies targeted by IP28, are taxed on income attributable to Oregon. Like individual taxpayers, they do what they can to minimize their tax burden. For instance, they hire accountants and use tax credits, both of which Our Oregon has included in a list of ways in which \"a giant corporation ... might get out of paying the taxes ... (it) owe(s).\" Never mind that it doesn't actually owe the taxes any more than an individual taxpayer making effective use of TurboTax would owe taxes reduced by means of credits and deductions. Such a business still must be held \"accountable,\" Our Oregon argues .\nAnd it has a plan.\nOregon has a mechanism that sets a tax floor for C-corporations with little or no taxable income. It's Oregon's corporate minimum tax, and Our Oregon and its partners want to supercharge it. The minimum tax is pegged to Oregon sales and features a dozen tiers, beginning at $150 for companies with less than $500,000 in sales and topping out at $100,000 for companies with $100 million or more. The tax applies whether a company's dismal income figure is the result of crafty accounting, generous government credits or lousy economic conditions.\nIP28 would fundamentally alter the minimum tax, adding a 2.5 percent tax on annual sales in excess of $25 million. The pro-tax coalition likes to call this a tax on \"large and out-of-state corporations\" and, to drive home the point, presents the Koch brothers boogeyman at every opportunity . All of this is code for \"the tax would affect someone besides you, and they deserve it.\" But reality is far more complex.\n\"Large\" is a relative term. While $25 million in Oregon sales might sound like a lot, the tax would affect about 1,000 companies, which provide a range of services and jobs throughout the state. It's likely, meanwhile, that most of the affected companies will be those that operate in multiple states, says senior economist Chris Allanach of the Legislative Revenue Office. Based on 2012 data, he says, about 76 percent of corporations likely to be affected are multistate corporations headquartered outside of Oregon. The remainder are Oregon-only companies or multistate companies headquartered here.\nIt would be a mistake, however, to assume that \"out of state\" automatically means \"someone else will pay.\"\nThe annual impact of the tax, according to a rough estimate by the Legislative Revenue Office, is about $2 billion. How, Oregonians should ask, are companies going to react? If Our Oregon's anti-corporate drumbeat has communicated anything, it's that C-corporations will do anything – anything – to avoid shouldering costs. The organization can hardly maintain, then, that affected companies are simply going to accept a massive hike in minimum taxes. To its credit, it doesn't.\nOur Oregon's view, as explained by Executive Director Ben Unger , is that many affected companies will look for ways to offset the tax burden without raising costs for consumers. When you're Walmart and your biggest advantage is that you're cheaper, he says, it's not that easy to jack up prices. Walmart and other companies, Unger says, could deduct their additional state taxes from their federal taxes.\nThe path of least resistance may, indeed, bypass Oregonians' wallets in some instances. In other cases, however, corporations will end up simply passing the cost along. When you're talking about a tax that will affect 1,000 companies in Oregon, including a wide range of retailers, it's impossible to know exactly how each will respond, and it would be utterly disingenuous to claim that consumers would not see higher prices as a result. To some degree – at this point unknowable – they certainly will.\nThorough vetting of impacts is one reason why the Legislature is the best place to hammer out sweeping tax policy. If upending Oregon's corporate tax structure in the way public employees unions and allied groups would like were really such a policy no-brainer, and if it would raise $2 billion per year without costing Oregonians much, why are its proponents rushing it straight to the ballot? It's not as if Oregon's government, dominated by Democrats, is hostile to unions.\nThis approach should concern voters, of course. But it also should worry legislators. Surely, they don't believe tax policy-by-initiative is a good idea, do they? They should show some leadership and speak up.\nIf they can't bring themselves to do this much, they should quit complaining at every turn about the effects of Measures 5 and 47/50, which upended Oregon's property tax system.", "external_links": ["http://ouroregon.org/about/", "http://ouroregon.org/we-do-our-part-so-why-dont-corporations/", "http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2016/028supct.pdf", "http://ouroregon.org/we-wont-let-the-kochs-have-their-way-in-oregon/", "http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Documents/pamphlet/2012/general-book13.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:37:01.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
