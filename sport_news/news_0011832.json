(Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times/TNS) ( Robert Gauthier ) \nAfter that, it's Washington and yet another true freshman: Jake Browning. \nThe lone veteran to face the rebuilt Cardinal secondary thus far: USC's Cody Kessler, who threw for 272 yards and three touchdowns. \n\"You just have to show them what college football is about,\" Stanford linebacker Blake Martinez said of the rookies. \nAsked about Rosen specifically, he added: \"We're not going to do anything crazy for him. We'll just go at what UCLA does on offense and make sure they don't get any explosive plays.\" \nAnd in case you were looking ahead, the lineup of quarterbacks set to face the Cardinal in the final month includes a redshirt freshman (Notre Dame), a sophomore (Washington State) and not Marcus Mariota (Oregon). Advertisement \nSpeaking of Rosen: \nThe Manhattan Beach product was the top-rated quarterback in the class of 2015, and Stanford stood atop his wish list. But according to reports, the Cardinal didn't offer a scholarship because of what it perceived to be Rosen's overbearing attitude. \nCoach David Shaw addressed the situation earlier this week: \"It's just the recruiting process and all the crap that comes out. He's a great kid ... I don't have to rehash (the situation).\" For more on college sports, see Jon Wilner's College Hotline at blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports .
