At the Sioux Falls Downtown Rotary Club, Admiral Peter Neffenger talked about the challenges airport security faces and how he is working with Congressional leaders to make sure you are safe on a plane. \nGoing through airport security can make some people feel like they are being asked to do a bit of a strip tease, however Neffenger says there is a reason for everything you take off before the plane takes off. \n\"We take the shoes off because the only way to determine whether or not to determine whether shoes are explosive is to X-ray them,\" Neffenger said. \nA few months into the job, Neffenger also took time to check out the Sioux Falls Regional Airport. It is part of his goal to educate airport authorities, lawmakers and travelers about the need for such strict security. This has been a challenge. Since 2011, TSA has lost 5,600 screeners due to budget cuts. Neffenger says he is trying to avoid even more cuts planned for next year. \n\"What I'd like to do is not further reduce the work force this year. If I can hold steady at my 2015 numbers as we institute some reforms as we try to grow the pre-check population, it'll allow me to stabilize over the course of the next year,\" Neffenger said. \nA Senate committee recently passed a bill to help the budget. Senator John Thune says it is important that Neffenger takes a good look at how things operate at a South Dakota airport. \n\"They've got a big job to do. Much of which is done at heavily trafficked airports in more populated areas, but there are unique circumstances associated and surrounding the traveling public that comes from a place like this,\" Thune said. \nNeffenger says he is the first TSA administrator to visit South Dakota in its 13 years of existence. One of his goals for this visit is to help make air travel safer and more efficient for passengers. \n\"There's no substitute for just hearing it firsthand and really understanding the uniqueness that is each airport,\" Neffenger said.
