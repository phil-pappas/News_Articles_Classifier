(Sue Beyer | lehighvalleylive.com) By Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 13, 2015 3:37 AM, updated October 13, 2015 5:00 PM View/Post Comments \nFriends and teammates gathered on the bleachers of Lehigh University's Lewis Indoor Tennis Center on Monday afternoon to cheer on Notre Dame senior Coco Chen on in the District 11 Class AA final. \nYou would think Chen has been at the school for more than two years based on the amount of support she received on Monday. \nBut she hasn't and has actually only been in America since she was 13 years old. Chen came to the United States in an exchange student program. She then moved from Florida to the Lehigh Valley two years ago. \n\"It's great,\" Chen said. \"I have great teammates and a great coach. Everyone is great to me.\" \nChen fought hard against defending state champion Tyra Ott of Wilson in Monday's final. The Crusader led the first set 4-3 and also battled back from a three-game deficit in the second set to tie it at 4-4. But in the end, Ott proved a little too tough for Chen. \nThe Notre Dame senior, who hopes to finish college in the United States, lives with a host family as all her relatives remain in China. Chen does video chat with her family when she can. \nBut she also has gained some new family members in Crusaders teammates. \n\"She gets along very well,\" Notre Dame coach Matt Crouse said. \"She's a good tennis player but she's even a better person.\" \nChen's career at Notre Dame isn't quite over yet as her and Logan Lencheski are seeded first in the upcoming Class AA doubles tournament, which starts on Wednesday. The senior also has the district team tournament coming up next week as the Crusaders finished the regular season with a 14-3 record. \n\"I think at this point she has nothing but pride for the career she has put out the last two years,\" Crouse said. \"And realistically we still have a little bit further. We've got the doubles and the teams coming up. So her career's not quite over yet. I'd like to think we'll cap it off in style.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:39:21.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
