This year or next year he might be leading the league in punt returns.\n\"He has that kind of ability.\n\"He's a big straight ahead strong runner and he does a good job in making people miss in space.\"\nThe 49ers have a good chance of ending their four-game losing streak on Sunday when they play at home against the Baltimore Ravens.\nThe 49ers and Ravens both have one win, four loss records.\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:42:06.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
