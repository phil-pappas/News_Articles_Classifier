Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune \"We'd love to have (Dexter Fowler back). We've loved everything about his game.\"— Jed Hoyer \nST. LOUIS — Dexter Fowler is a free agent after the 2015 season and could be one of the more prominent center fielders on the market. \nBut before Game 2 of the National League Division Series, Fowler said he hasn't been thinking about whether or not he will return to the Cubs. \n\"You know what? I don't,\" he said. \"I believe God has a process and if this is where I need to be, this is where I need to be. I'm taking it day by day, and right now just focused on winning.\" \nFowler did his thing again in Game 2 of the NLDS on Saturday, going 2-for-5 with an RBI infield single in the five-run second inning of the 6-3 victory and patrolling center like a meter reader looking for parking violations in the Loop. \n\"Joe (Maddon) always says as he goes, we go,\" general manager Jed Hoyer said. \"I think you saw that in the wild-card win in Pittsburgh. He has been a great catalyst for us. \n\"I love the way about him. He always has a smile. He's always bouncing around the clubhouse. He's very loose and confident in his abilities, sometimes in almost a brash way, and that's great with our team. \n\"He has been a great fit for us. I don't know what the future holds. It's not the right time to talk about it. But we'd love to have him (back). We've loved everything about his game and the way he has gone about his business for us.\" \nBefore Game 2, Fowler knew he would have to jump-start the Cubs offense, which had been shut out on three hits in Game 1. \n\"I guess I'll be setting the tone,\" Fowler said. \"We'll see. We'll see. We will let the game come to us. That's the game of baseball; you don't always get to face guys you're familiar with, so obviously we're going to be a little patient.\" \nThe Cubs were patient and ready for Jaime Garcia, who lasted only two innings before leaving with a stomach ailment. \nIt wasn't headline news when the Cubs acquired the switch-hitting Fowler last January for third baseman Luis Valbuena and pitcher Dan Straily, hoping to fill a void at the leadoff spot and in center. \nIn 2014 the Cubs used a combination of rookie Arismendy Alcantara, Emilio Bonifacio, Junior Lake, Ryan Sweeney and Justin Ruggiano in center, while Bonifacio, Chris Coghlan and Alcantara served as their primary leadoff men. \nAfter a slow first half in which he hit .232 with a .308 on-base percentage, Fowler finished with a .375 OBP and had career highs in home runs (17) and runs scored (102). He really began heating up in August, hitting .298 during the month with a .408 on-base percentage and .995 OPS, with 10 RBIs and 17 extra-base hits. \nNot coincidentally, the Cubs started taking off when Fowler began to get in a groove. \n\"When you have that lead-off guy on in front of (Kyle) Schwarber, (Anthony) Rizzo and (Kris) Bryant, pitchers pitch differently,\" Hoyer said. \"Our run scoring really changed when he got going. \n\"I give the guy credit. It's hard when you struggle in the first half in a contract year in a new city. It's easy to panic. But he went out after the All-Star break and took off.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:27:29.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
