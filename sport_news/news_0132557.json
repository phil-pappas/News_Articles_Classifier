I got a vest under my jersey, arm pad, thigh, tail, knees ... everything has been padded up,'' Lillard said. \"My rookie year I didn't wear any. But when I started hitting the ground, I thought it would be a good idea to protect myself. Each year, I fall less. The coaches talk about staying off the court, and I try to do a lot better with that.''\nIt hasn't worked yet this preseason, as Lillard is crashing to the floor at a high rate. On Thursday, however, the risks came with some reward: Lillard attempted 17 free throws, making 15.\nCoach Terry Stotts noted that one of Lillard's strengths is attacking, so he doesn't want to limit Lillard's effectiveness by worrying about his health.\n\"I like him being aggressive,'' Stotts said. \"I think it's important that he plays his game. The fact that he got to the line 17 times is something we need. I wouldn't discourage him from being aggressive.''\nLillard said he turned his left ankle in Monday's game against Sacramento, then re-aggravated it Thursday when he was on a breakaway late in the third quarter.\n\"I was trying to pick up speed and change direction, and when I changed direction, somebody bumped me and I lost my balance,'' Lillard said. \"You know how it is when you turn your ankle â€“ it's just a little bit painful at the moment.''\nLillard has never missed an NBA game, and is usually adamant about playing through injuries, but he said he would consider sitting out one of the Blazers' five remaining exhibition games.\n\"I would. I would. I've had bad ankle injuries and I've had little tweaks, and I've had ankle injuries where I feel it could linger on,'' Lillard said. \"This one is like ... minor.''\n-- Jason Quick | jquick@oregonian.com | @jwquick", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jwquick"], "published": "2015-10-09T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:36:01.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
