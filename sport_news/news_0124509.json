Nine different players recorded a shot for Tennessee, including two each for Rylie O'Keefe, Susan Ferguson, Emily Morrow, Anna Bialczak and Anna McClung. \nOle Miss, meanwhile, didn't record its first shot until the 33rd minute. \n\"I thought our first 20 to 25 minutes was very good â€¦ and then I thought we lost a little bit of composure, lost a little bit of an edge and that led to a corner kick and we didn't attack the ball,\" UT coach Brian Pensky said. \nThe Rebels scored off that corner kick in the 34th minute. Hiskey rose above everyone in the middle of the box and headed one home past UT goalkeeper Julie Eckel for a 1-0 lead. \nKizer scored in the 77th minute, beating Eckel from about 20 yards out with a perfect strike under the cross bar. \nUT will host Kentucky on Sunday (TV: SEC Network, 5 p.m.) and honor seniors Eckel, Ferguson and Gabby Santorio.
