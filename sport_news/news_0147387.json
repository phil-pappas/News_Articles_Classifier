The Heat lost both of their regular-season games against the Spurs last season by double digits, with the teams again to meet twice this season . . . As always, it likely will come down to game-time decisions as to which Spurs veterans are in the lineup. Not only did Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Boris Diaw not make the trip when the Spurs opened their preseason in Sacramento, but coach Gregg Popovich also bypassed that trip, as well . . . The Spurs return with their veteran core intact, augmented by the offseason additions of free-agent forwards LaMarcus Aldridge and David West . . . Former Heat forward Rasual Butler is locked in a battle with Jimmer Fredette for a final San Antonio roster spot . . . The Spurs again feature former WNBA star Becky Hammon as an assistant coach . . .
