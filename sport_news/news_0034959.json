West Ranch: 983 A A A \nElisa Pierre was so dialed in throughout the final Foothill League golf round of her career on Wednesday, she almost forgot to soak in her finishing putt. \nBut as the Golden Valley senior tapped in for par on the 18th hole of TPC Valencia, she could finally take a moment to realize everything she’d just accomplished. \nPierre became the first in Foothill League history to secure a third straight league Player of the Year prize after an outstanding final two days of league play on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Wednesday, she also tacked on her third consecutive Newhall Land Cup title with a Cup-record score of 5-under 103 in the 27-hole competition. That bested the previous record of 105 set by Hart’s Brenna Carlson in 2010. \n“It’s everything I could have hoped for and these four years went by really fast, but they were really fun. I’m so thankful to be a part of this league where everyone is so supportive and everyone is so close,” Pierre said after the round. \nHer 2-under 34 on Wednesday gave her a six-round cumulative league score of 171 after her highest score was thrown out, per league rules. That bested second-place Ashley Mayhall of West Ranch, who carded a 39 on Wednesday to put her at 179 overall. \n“She just proved why she’s the best female golfer in Foothill League history,” said Golden Valley head coach Tony Moskal. \nPierre and Mayhall were neck-and-neck in the Player of the Year race all season. \n“I guess it was pretty intense, and we were both trying to play our best, but we’re friendly and we like each other and we’re friends so it wasn’t like a fiery rivalry or anything,” Mayhall said of the duel. \nOn the bright side for Mayhall, West Ranch as a team wrapped up a dominant run through Foothill play this season on the way to clinching a fourth league crown in the last five years. \nThe Wildcats won all six league matches handily and ended up with a cumulative score of 983 strokes, which was 191 better than second-place Valencia and 232 ahead of third-place Golden Valley. \n“We’re just staying focused and we’re not letting up even though we know we have a big lead,” said West Ranch senior Kate Caffrey. “And we just keep practicing really hard, and I’m just really proud of our team.” \nWest Ranch was led all year by its rock solid trio of Mayhall, Caffrey and Mack Bailey. In the overall individual standings, Bailey finished third with a total mark of 184 and Caffrey took fifth at 193. \nGiven the team’s success this year, the goal now shifts to trying to advance in the postseason. Last year, West Ranch fell four strokes short of moving on in the first round. \nAll of West Ranch’s dynamic trio will advance to the CIF-SS Northern Individual Regionals on Oct. 26. They’ll be joined by Pierre, Valencia’s Eunice Song (fourth, 188) and Saugus’ Clara Venger (sixth, 198) as individual qualifiers. \nPierre will be trying to repeat her incredible postseason run from her sophomore season, when she became just the second SCV female golfer to ever reach the state finals. \n“In the postseason, I just want to go back to that sophomore-year mindset of just one shot at a time, one round at a time, one hole at a time,” she said. \nWest Ranch’s Noelle Song just missed out on the individual cutoff with her seventh-place score of 205. Golden Valley’s Justine Reblando was eighth at 209 and Valencia’s Sarah Baranda was ninth at 214. \nAs far as the team playoffs go, West Ranch and Golden Valley are both assured spots in the CIF-Southern Section Central Team Divisional on Nov. 2 because both have posted enough qualifying scores this season, according to CIF rules. \nWith its second-place finish in league, Valencia can still get in if it puts up one more qualifying score in the next week and a half. \nSaugus ended up in fourth place at 1,301 total strokes, followed by Canyon (1,405) and Hart, which didn’t have enough official scores to qualify.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:23:18.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
