So there have to be standards, even if what's being expressed is a tiny picture of a smiling pile of poop with eyes .\nThe Unicode Consortium is made up of members like Facebook, Google, Apple and Adobe, and \"enables people around the world to use computers in any language,\" according to its website .\nBefore being added to the Unicode Standard and becoming available for use on devices like your cell phone, emoji characters have to be approved based on selection factors that include expected usage level, image distinctiveness and whether or not they're already representable by existing emoji or sequences of emoji.\nThe same emoji character can be represented with different illustrations depending on a variety of factors. The \"grinning face\" emoji, for example, differs between Apple, Android, Windows, Twitter and Gmail interfaces. While each one is indeed a grinning face, the icons vary in appearance.\nThe decision on which of the 67 candidates to include in Unicode 9.0 will be made in May of 2016. Watch the video above to see if one you've been wishing for might make the cut.\n-- Dave Killen", "external_links": ["http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-candidates.html", "http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html", "http://unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Selection_Factors", "http://www.fastcompany.com/3037803/the-oral-history-of-the-poop-emoji-or-how-google-brought-poop-to-america", "http://www.unicode.org/"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:35:00.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
