That forced Latham to miss the Hoosiers' 34-27 loss to Ohio State, a game in which Ezekiel Elliott ran for a career high 274 yards and scored on runs of 55, 65 and 75 yards. \nThe statement issued Friday by Indiana (4-1, 0-1 Big Ten) did not say how the case was resolved — only that Latham traveled with the team and there would be no additional comments. \nLatham is tied for the team lead in sacks with two and tackles for loss with five despite missing two games. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:23:37.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
