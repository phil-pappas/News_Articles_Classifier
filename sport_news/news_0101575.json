Liberty 25-18, 25-13, 25-16 – Rapid Recap \nParkland High School’s girls volleyball team captured its sixth consecutive league championship on Saturday afternoon, sweeping Liberty 25-18, 25-13, 25-16 in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference final at Whitehall High School. \nTurning point : The Trojans (19-0) were never seriously threatened by Liberty (19-2). Grace Steurer’s kill off the block gave Parkland an eight-point lead (22-14) in the first set. Setter Kristin Krause finished off the segment by looping a ball over the Liberty defense, and her team continued to roll from there. \nTop performers : Middle hitter Erika Foose had another solid outing for the Trojans. The senior finished with 13 kills, including a deluge in the second set. \nClassmate Sam Webber was also very effective, tallying nine kills and a career-high seven blocks. \nWhat it means : Parkland’s stretch of six consecutive league titles goes back to the Lehigh Valley Conference. The nationally ranked Trojans will enter the District 11 Class AAA bracket as the top seed. \nLiberty , a young team new to the championship stage, will try to regroup before district play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:19:40.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
