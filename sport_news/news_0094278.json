This week, Ohio State had 39 first-place votes in the poll released Sunday after routing Rutgers.\nBaylor, Clemson, LSU and TCU - the rest of the top 5 - also received first-place votes, as did No. 7 Alabama.\nUtah had its highest regular-season ranking after climbing to No. 3 last week, but dropped 10 spots after losing to unranked Southern California.\nFlorida State also dropped after its first loss of the season, falling eight places to No. 17. The Seminoles lost 22-16 to Georgia Tech on a blocked field goal that was returned for a touchdown on the game's final play.\n___\nAP college football website: college football.AP.org\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

A team receives 25 points for each first place vote, 24 for second place and so on through to the 25th team, which receives one point. The rankings are set by listing the teams' point totals from highest to lowest. Fox 8's Garland Gillen is one of those voters.\nThis is Garland Gillen's 6th year as a voter for the Associated Press poll.\n AP TOP 25 RANK GARLAND GILLEN'S TOP 25 OHIO STATE 1 OHIO STATE BAYLOR 2 LSU CLEMSON 3 BAYLOR LSU 4 CLEMSON TCU 5 TCU MICHIGAN STATE 6 ALABAMA ALABAMA 7 MICHIGAN STATE STANFORD 8 IOWA NOTRE DAME 9 OKLAHOMA STATE IOWA 10 STANFORD FLORIDA 11 FLORIDA OKLAHOMA STATE 12 MEMPHIS UTAH 13 NOTRE DAME OKLAHOMA 14 HOUSTON MICHIGAN 15 UTAH MEMPHIS 16 OLE MISS FLORIDA STATE 17 FLORIDA STATE HOUSTON 18 OKLAHOMA OLE MISS 19 TEMPLE TOLEDO 20 MICHIGAN TEMPLE 21 MISSISSIPPI STATE DUKE 22 TOLEDO PITTSBURGH 23 DUKE UCLA 24 PITTSBURGH MISSISSIPPI STATE 25 UCLA\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
