(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Purdy Eagles rallied behind their home crowd while playing hosts to Class 1, District 7 volleyball - utilizing that advantage to knock off top-seeded School of the Ozarks Patriots, 2-1 (18-25, 25-20, 25-12) in the championship final on Tuesday night.\"You know that feels good, honestly that hasn't crossed my mind up until this point,\" said two-year Purdy head coach Ashley Brown on eliminating Mark Twain Conference Champion S of O. \"We're trying to take it one game at a time, we were focused on Exeter and making sure that got done.\"We had a game plan to make sure we took care of it permanently.\" Entering the final game between both squads, the Lady Patriots were riding a 22-game winning streak extended after a semi-final victory over the fourth-seeded Wheaton Bulldogs earlier on Tuesday, had eliminated Purdy from district semis in straight sets last year, and were hungry for a district final win coming off back-to-back championship losses. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE GAME School of the Ozarks cruised to take the first set over Purdy with seemingly everything going their way. Midway through the first set, the Lady Eagles cut the well-composed Patriots lead down to 13-12 following a 9-2 route in favor of the latter. S of O finished out the set on a 12-5 run for the early 1-0 advantage. The Patriots stormed out to a 10-4 lead in the second set, but after a timeout called by Purdy at that point, momentum immediately shifted towards the Eagles who later tied the score up at 12-all. Beyond that point during the second set, both sides exchanged leads or converted a tie 11 times before Purdy finally edged School of the Ozarks, 25-20, for a winner-take-all third set for the Class 1 - District 7 crown. Momentum was the theme of the night as the Eagles carried that over from the second set by jumping out to an 11-3 advantage and ran away with a 25-12 third set win to beat S of O, 2-1 and record their first district title under head coach Ashley Brown\"Overall performance was great,\" said Brown. \"Every position stepped up, did their job, and that's just exactly what we need them to do tonight. I'm very proud of them. PICTURES: Purdy vs. Hurley - CLICK HERE \"Certainly, our setter she's the one who has been leading us all year, leading our offense,\" said Brown on her setter Morgan Schilly and followed with Hallie Henderson. \"We've got two setters actually, they have done a really nice job. Both of them went in and set great balls to give our hitters great opportunities that we really needed.\" For School of the Ozarks (30-2-1), they were eliminated from further postseason play, but in their third-year as a program head coach Charlie Warfield had some words of encouragement to his seniors.\"This being our third year it's good to be going to the district final three years in a row,\" said Warfield. \"It'd be nice if you could win one, but Purdy's an excellent team.\"One thing I will say for the seniors, I won't change the character of these girls. They have worked so hard, they have really made me proud after four years now, some of them five.‚Äù With the win, Purdy (20-9-5) advances to the sectional tournament and is set to play on Saturday, October 24th.
