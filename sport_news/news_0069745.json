The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights earlier put the death toll at 45 rebels and civilians.\nThe First Coastal Division is one of several groups that have received foreign military support including U.S.-made anti-tank missiles, the most potent weapon in the rebels' arsenal.\nThe group, which fights under the umbrella of the \"Free Syrian Army\", confirmed the death of its chief of staff, Basil Zamo, formerly a captain in the Syrian military.\nAhmad said a fighter trained in the use of the anti-tank TOW missiles had also been killed. The Russian jets had struck one of the group's headquarters, and then struck the same target again after rescue workers had arrived on the scene.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:20:23.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
