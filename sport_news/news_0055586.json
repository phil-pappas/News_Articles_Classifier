Pinkel: Mizzou fosters locker room of encouragers, not discouragers. Doesn't believe def is frustrated w/ off. Sticking together as a team. — Tod Palmer (@todpalmer) October 19, 2015 \nAfter starting a perfect 3-0 in nonconference play, the Tigers have dropped three of its first four games in SEC play. \nDefensively, the team is playing well enough to win. Missouri hasn't given up more than 21 points in any game this season. The likes of Kentrell Brothers , Charles Harris , Walter Brady , and company have been very effective. GP: I think players are more determined. How you react to it is the most important thing. There's a sense of urgency. — Mizzou Football (@MizzouFootball) October 19, 2015 \nHowever, the offense has been a major concern. As true freshman Drew Lock can attest to, competing against veteran and talented SEC defenses isn't easy by any stretch. Russell Hansbrough's lack of health has greatly hindered production running the football, as has shoddy play along the offensive line. \nIt's imperative for Missouri to not continue in this downward spiral. While a third-straight SEC East Division title appears unlikely, a bowl game is more than feasible. Missouri and Vanderbilt should be proud; they're part of the lowest opening O/U in a college football game this season with total set at 34 — Todd Fuhrman (@ToddFuhrman) October 19, 2015 \nLock will look to get the offense back on track against a struggling Vanderbilt team this Saturday in Nashville.
