Pic/Getty Images \nAfter winning the Twenty20 series, South Africa are now one win away from pocketing the one-day series which they are leading 2-1. \"There's no guarantee in cricket. We can come out and India can play extremely well. But it will be nice to seal it here and go to Mumbai.\nWe've spoken about it in team meetings, we want to go overseas and dominate the opposition. We have a good chance now to be able to do that. We definitely have an advantage. We have to win one more to win the series and if we play good cricket we'll do that,\" Steyn said on the eve of the fourth ODI here.\nThere is a lot of debate going on MS Dhoni's batting and captaincy in the wake of poor results against Proteas but Steyn said he does not find anything wrong in Indian skipper's style of leadership in this series.\n'No comment about MSD' \n\"No comment on Dhoni as a captain because I've never played under him. I've played against him. But you have to look at who you are playing against. In our camp, every batsman is hitting the ball sweetly and every bowler is landing where he wants to. We've been executing very well.\nIn terms of Dhoni's captaincy, I don't think he's doing anything too different to what he has done in the past. It's just that they're up against a side that's playing really good cricket.\"\nThe fearsome quick was not worried about hot conditions in Chennai. \"We've been in India for two weeks and it has been hot. We've played here before and the heat isn't really a big factor. We've been to some hot countries in the past and it's no different for us anymore,\" he said.\nMiller surprise \nTalking about the surprise move of sending aggressive batsman David Miller as an opener in the last one-dayer, Steyn said the decision made sense: \"Most of us weren't aware that Miller would open until the morning of the match. It's no secret that the best time to bat is when the ball is hard and new. It's the best opportunity to score runs.\"\n28 \nNumber of wickets Dale Steyn (right) has claimed against India in 16 one-day internationals. He averages 23.71 against India and his best performance was 5 for 50 in the 2011 World Cup game at Nagpur", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:45:59.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
