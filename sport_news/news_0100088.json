(Matt Smith | For lehighvalleylive.com) By Greg Joyce | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 19, 2015 4:51 PM View/Post Comments \nFor the second year in a row, the Freedom football team’s 7-0 start has come at a cost. \nJunior quarterback Joe Young is questionable heading into Friday’s showdown with Parkland after sustaining a leg injury against Whitehall last Friday . \nYoung was visiting the doctor Monday afternoon while the Patriots practiced. \n“From what we’re hearing, it’s not going to be season-ending,” coach Jason Roeder said. “But we’ll wait and see.” \nIt's an all-too-familiar situation for Freedom. Last year, the same exact week, they were waiting to hear about Young's status. By Tuesday, they found out he had fractured his hip socket in the Week 7 game against the Zephyrs and was out for the year. \nRELATED : Who is the best quarterback in the Lehigh Valley? (VOTE) \nOnce again, the Patriots are preparing to take on the Trojans while waiting to find out where their quarterback stands. \n“Right now, as of Monday, there’s a couple different scenarios that could play out,” Roeder said. “It’s going to depend on Joe’s health. Once we get a clear picture of his status – the sooner we can know something about Joe, the better we can plan for our week. But right now, we’re just planning for a bunch of different scenarios.” \nOn Monday, it was senior Jonah Gundrum wearing the red jersey at practice, signifying him as the quarterback. Gundrum took over last year as well when Young got injured. \nAgainst Whitehall, with Young hobbled late in the game, Gundrum – who has flourished as a wide receiver/defensive back – came in and took the reins without any problem to close out the win. \n“Jonah’s a special football player, a special kid,” Roeder said. “He just does anything and everything you ask of him. If you look at his stat line this year, he’s run for touchdowns, he’s thrown for touchdowns, he’s picked balls off, he’s blocked kicks, he’s blocked punts. \n“He just does everything for us. He’s a rock. He’s a mature kid, an outstanding student in the classroom. He’s just one of those guys.” \nWhile it may feel like deja vu for the Patriots, they can at least take comfort in having Gundrum ready to go if need be. \n“He’s confident,” senior tight end/defensive end Cordell Cotto said. “He’s been doing it since freshman year. Our whole team has his back.” \nFreedom was already dealt a blow by the injury bug earlier this year when starting running back Roberto Diez was injured in a Week 3 game and had to undergo surgery . He is out at least for the regular season, a possible return dependent on how far the Patriots advance in the postseason. \nAndres Santos has stepped into that role well, though, and they expect the same from Gundrum if Young is forced to the sideline for the Parkland game. \n“We never look back,” Cotto said. “We know things happen, so we just try to build from it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:56:15.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
