The Shanghai title was also his third in four years in Shanghai after triumphing in 2012 and 2013. \nThe title was his 25th Masters 1000 title, and also further extended his lead atop the ATP Race To London standings, eclipsing the 14,000-point threshold to bring his haul to 14,285. \nThe win brought him the 57th title on the ATP tour and also helped Djokovic improve to 14-6 against Tsonga in their head-to-head rivalry. \nThe Belgrade native extended his ruthless run on Chinese soil, improving to a combined 10-0 in finals in the country. He won six China Open titles, three Shanghai Masters title and one Masters Cup title overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:35:41.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
