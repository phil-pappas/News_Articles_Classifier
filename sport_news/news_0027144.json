A hurried visit to my local optometrist turned into an emergency trip to a retina specialist. \nThe laser operation was successful. My eye is still clouded and I am still restricted from most of the normal activities of a sports writer — such as reading, writing, and driving a vehicle. My usefulness as a sports writer is therefore temporarily nonexistent. \nIf I were covering a football game right now, and a runner was running from right to left, he would likely disappear into what appears to be a giant amoeba. \nI have been told that my vision will not be permanently affected. The cloudiness in my left eye which resembles a huge hunk of lint plunked down in the middle of my eyeball, should dissipate with time. How much time, no one knows for certain. \nBut I feel very fortunate in that no permanent damage was done, and that the problem was addressed quickly and skillfully resolved. \nThoughts go through a person's mind when he is waiting to hear what is happening in his eye. \nI cannot express how grateful I feel that I will continue to be able to see my grand daughters' faces — and Canada geese flying in formation over Bowen Field on a late summer evening — to see a beautiful full moon rising from behind a mountain visible beyond the bleachers of a football stadium — the fall colors spangling the mountainsides in this beautiful part of America — and the quiet beauty of a new snowfall blanketing the ground on a winter morning. \nI look forward to resuming my \"normal\" activities as soon as possible. That may happen as early as the end of this week. It will be up to a doctor to provide that clearance. \nUntil then, I am deeply grateful to the people who have offered to help. That includes my wife, Chris, who is patiently helping me through all of the recuperative processes. That also includes Daily Telegraph sports editor Brian Woodson, who is temporarily a \"one-man show\" on the sports desk. \nI am a lucky man, and a grateful man and a humbled man. \nTom Bone is a Daily Telegraph sports writer and cartoonist.
