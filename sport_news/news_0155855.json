They exchanged the lead six times, five times in the first half alone. \nGlastonbury (3-1) led at both the half (31-27) and after three quarters (41-34). \nTwo-time CIAC Class LL champion Southington finally wore down the Tomahawks with its breakneck offense. It scored 27 unanswered points in the fourth quarter. \nThe rivals could meet again in the Class LL playoffs, as they did last season. \nWethersfield (4-0) makes it season debut at No. 10. Bacon Academy (4-0) and Norwich Free Academy (4-0) are the area teams receiving votes. \n— Ned Griffen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:38:03.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
