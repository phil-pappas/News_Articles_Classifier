(AP) - The Portsmouth Police Commission has failed to endorse an agreement that would allow the city's police chief to continue working for another three months.\nChief Stephen DuBois announced in September that he was going to resign. The original agreement debated Monday would've ended his employment in March 2016. The new agreement would've accepted the chief's resignation in January and included an additional three months of severance pay.\nThe Commission split a vote endorsing the agreement Wednesday and voted to continue it until Oct. 20.\nThe Commission, the chief and City Council must all agree to the separation agreement.\nDuBois is named in a lawsuit filed by a former officer who says he was placed under a gag order for giving an interview last year about a now-fired police sergeant.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:39:28.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
