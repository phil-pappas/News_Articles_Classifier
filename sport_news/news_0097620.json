So here in Toledo, there is a new facility dedicated entirely to providing housing for homeless veterans. It's called the Commons at Garden Lake, and it's located off Detroit in South Toledo. It has 75 one bedroom apartments. Right now there are 30 residents, it's hoped that it will be at full capacity by Thanksgiving.\nThe facility is funded by federal grants, and it requires that residents pay 30-percent of their income toward their rent, while public assistance pays the rest. US Senator Sherrod Brown stopped by the facility Monday to talk about how the Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2015 would increase veterans' access to permanent housing options.
