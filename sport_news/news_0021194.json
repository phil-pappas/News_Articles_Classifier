I can't,\" and then burst into tears, his voice breaking. \n\n\"Before Bill played 17, and I said, 'Come on, Bill, win one for your mom here. Your mom deserves this'.\" \n\nIt was heartbreak for Bae and the huge home galleries watching as he fluffed a chip from short of the green attempting to win the hole and square the match, which would have given the Internationals a 15-15 tie and a share of the cup for only the second time. \n\nHaas was in the greenside sand but safely escaped to six feet, and when Bae could not hole his fourth he conceded the match to the American. \n\nIt was a dramatic denouement to a see-saw day in which the US at one point had looked firmly in the driving seat. \n\nMidway through the final 12 singles the US led in eight matches and were all square in two others needing just six points to secure the golden trophy for the ninth time in the event's 11th edition. \n\nSlowly but surely the Internationals reeled in their opponents to set up a nail-biting finish that had seemed highly unlikely when the US had raced to a 4-1 lead after Thursday's foursomes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:41:33.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
