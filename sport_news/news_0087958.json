Posted: Sunday, October 4, 2015 6:00 am \nGROVELAND — Jessy Page was confident that she could win a state championship. \nAfter all, she had done it before. \nThe South Lake High School senior’s confidence in herself paid off when she won the girls discus championship in last year’s Florida High School Athletic Association Class 3A state track and field finals at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville. On Friday, Page was officially recognized by the school when she was presented with her state championship ring at halftime of South Lake’s football game against Orlando Bishop Moore. \nPage’s winning toss of 128 feet, 9 inches was good enough by 18 inches to win the state championship. It was her second-straight state title. As a sophomore, she won the discus state championship in New Jersey. \n“I definitely went into the finals last year thinking I could win it all,” Page said. “I certainly wanted to win. Not many people have won state championships in two different states, so that was a big deal. But, that’s also my mindset when I compete. \n“When I do something, I do it to win.” \nPage said the confidence she exudes in everything she does comes from a combination of the normal maturation process as well as from her past successes. She knows her capabilities and she is always working to get better, both in the classroom and in athletics. \nIn addition to her athletic success, Page is an academic standout with a 3.87 grade point average. \n“Jessy is an impressive scholar and athlete, and an outstanding example for our student body,” said Rob McCue, South Lake principal. “She broke our school records for the discus as a freshman and has shown her athletic abilities the past two years by winning state titles in New Jersey and in Florida. Jessy is a well-rounded scholar athlete and would be an asset to any university in the country as an athlete and as a scholar. She displays commitment, dedication and excellence in everything she does. \n“We’re blessed to have her at South Lake.” \nAnother factor that has likely helped Page develop her gritty attitude is her upbringing. Her father was in the U.S. Army, a career from which he is now retired. Her stepmother still is on active duty in the Army, but will be retiring soon. \nLike many “Army brats,” as Page calls herself, she has likely grown up faster emotionally, partly because of the frequent moves required due to her parents’ relocation to new duty stations. \nBeing around a military environment has helped her see things in a different perspective. Unlike many teenagers, Page said she doesn’t often panic in stressful situations, like competing for a state championship. \n“I don’t feel a lot of pressure on myself,” Page said. “It doesn’t matter if I’m getting ready to take a big test or preparing for a big meet. I practice hard and work on perfecting my technique. No matter what it is I’m doing, I do the best I can. \n“That way, I can’t be disappointed.” \nDespite the apparent ease with which she approaches everything, when Page learned how school officials wanted to honor her with a ring presentation ceremony, she admitted to being a little uncomfortable. \n“When I was told they wanted to present it to me at halftime of a football game, I was like ‘What?’” Page said. “But, I smiled about it a lot. It’s quite an honor to get that kind of recognition. Not many people get that experience.” \nAs she becomes more successful, Page’s reputation among college coaches is growing. Page said a number of coaches have expressed an interest in her and she is confident that she’ll earn a scholarship and get a chance to compete at the next level. \nPage knows that college will take care of itself, as long as she continues to excel academically and athletically. \nAnd that shouldn’t be an issue. With two state titles in consecutive years, Page’s appetite for more has grown more ravenous. \nShe’s already working toward a second-straight FHSAA title in the 2016 finals. \nPage is maturing physically. She’s taller and stronger than she was as a junior. \nShe is taking part in conditioning drills to get ready for the season and has been concentrating on perfecting her throwing technique. \n“There’s always room for improvement,” Page said. “I have to get better, because the girls I compete against are getting better. I know I’m capable of winning another state championship, but it takes a lot of work. \n“I’m going to be ready when that time comes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:05:52.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
