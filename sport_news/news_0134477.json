They tied the previous mark last week, when they were No. 19.Reinhardt will have another chance to bolster its rankings against winless Bluefield (0-5) on Saturday before beginning Mid-South Conference West Division play against No. 3 Faulkner on Oct. 10.♦ ♦ ♦Senior David Sweet was named Creekview’s offensive player of the week after he anchored an offensive line that blocked for 160 yards and two rushing touchdowns in the Grizzlies’ 21-14 win over Cass.Sweet’s performance was even more important due to rainy conditions that made it difficult to pass. Linebacker Dylan Carl was one of the players who took advantage of the adverse conditions. The senior intercepted a pass and forced a fumble with Cass driving in the red zone, on his way to being named the Grizzlies’ defensive player of the week.Sequoyah also chose a lineman as its offensive player as senior Coleman Pecht blocked for an offense that produced 299 yards in a 31-0 loss to Dalton. Junior linebacker Luke Rogers won the award for defense, recording four solo tackles, and sophomore Justin Lingerfelt, who had three solo tackles, was honored on special teams.Tight end Nate Holton was Reinhardt’s offensive player of the week, after the senior propelled the Eagles to 318 rushing yards with his blocks on the edge. Sophomore defensive lineman Key Hicks was honored on defense after recording three total tackles, including two for loss. Aaron Kennedy was named special teams player with two punt returns for 24 yards. The junior wide receiver also caught a 32-yard touchdown pass in the game.Freshmen Sonny Harris and Alex Gardner were named offensive and defensive scout team players of the week, respectively.♦ ♦ ♦Reinhardt’s men’s soccer team stayed undefeated in Appalachian Athletic Conference play on Saturday when it traveled to beat Bluefield 2-0.The victory got the Eagles (4-4, 2-0) back in the win column after they suffered a 3-2 loss to Bob Jones last Tuesday.The game was a defensive struggle that featured only six total shots on goal, with four shots coming from Reinhardt. Freshman Torge Wiedenroth stopped both of Bluefield’s shots to preserve the shutout, while sophomore Matthew Gray and junior Alan Barikos scored goals in the 21st and 79th minutes respectively.The Reinhardt women also played Bluefield on Saturday, coming away with a 5-2 win.Reinhardt (6-1-1, 1-1) used a strong defensive second half, only allowing Bluefield two shots and one on target, and a pair of goals from sophomore Megan McCall to pull away late.Early goals from Stephanie Goins, Lindsey White and Allie Hale put Reinhardt up 3-0 in the 28th minute, but Bluefield answered with a pair of goals in the final 15 minutes of the first half to keep the game close. McCall scored her first goal off the second half’s opening kickoff to give Reinhardt some space, and her goal in the 70th minute sealed the win for the Lady Eagles.Reinhardt has scored 15 goals during its three-game winning streak, and Saturday marked the third time in eight games that the Lady Eagles scored at least five goals.Both Reinhardt teams will be back in action today, traveling to Dayton, Tennessee to face AAC rival Bryan.
