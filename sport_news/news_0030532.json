Since at least last year MLB broadcasts -- both local and national -- have featured erectile dysfunction ads. It seems like there is one every commercial break. There are different versions but the message is always the same.\nTuning the commercials out while watching alone or with other adults is easy enough. But watching with children who aren't quite old enough to learn about sex is another matter. It's uncomfortable if not downright inappropriate.\nCardinals ace Adam Wainwright , a father with three young daughters, recently called out MLB on Twitter for the non-stop erectile dysfunction ads. Here's his tweet :\nWainwright is just one person but I'm certain there are countless other parents out there who hit mute or change the channel while watching the game with their kids whenever one of these commercials pops up.\nAt the end of the day, MLB is a business, and these commercials air because the companies pay the price and buy the air time. I'm sure the league has a screening process, though obviously these commercials have been deemed appropriate.\nSince taking over as commissioner earlier this year, Rob Manfred has said one of his goals is to increase the game's popularity among young fans. Do these commercials help the league achieve that goal? If even one parent decides to watch another sport instead of baseball because of these ads, the answer is no.\nWainwright is just one parent but he is a parent with a powerful voice given his standing as an ambassador for the league. If he helps get MLB to reconsider running seemingly non-stop erectile dysfunction ads, then great. Parents around the country will be thrilled.\n\nAdam Wainwright called out MLB for their erectile dysfunction ads.
