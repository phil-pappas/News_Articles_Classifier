If his injury was in his head, he wouldn't have done so. Nice to see. 2-Palmer was tight the last drive and led to two bad throws. It is too bad, because he was pretty solid all game before that. 3-I think Palmer threw the ball to Brown because he thought the S was shading to Floyd. It looked like a late break by the S. 4-Chris Johnson looked good. Count me wrong on his signing in the preseason. 5-David Johnson lets the ball get loose from his body after contact which he will need to correct. 6-If David Johnson can learn to run similar to Chris Johnson, he can have a long career in the NFL. 7-Nice to see Fitzgerald being the player I like seeing him be. 8-Floyd was pretty involved today, and played one of his better games as a pro. 9-I'm still not interested in paying Floyd 6mil+ a year. 10-John Brown played a good game by my eyes today. 11-Offensive put up 447 vs the Rams defense which is crazy good. 12-4 sacks on 46 pass attempts is not a terrible day in pass blocking vs the best defensive front in football. 13-Every linemen stood out today with bad plays but if you look at the guys they were playing against, it isn't surprising. 14-Gresham isn't good enough to drop passes but that was his MO in Cincy. 15-I liked the game I saw from Fells. 16-moving campbell inside seems to hurt our ability to set the edge. 17-Our front didn't generate a bunch of pressure but that isn't what they do. 18-Our linebacking corp was the worst unit on the field today. 19-Minter's lack of lateral quickness was on display today, but that is who he is. 20-Deone seemed to get caught inside a bunch today which shows his inexperience at LB. 21-Our edge linebackers seemed to struggle with contain and getting off blocks to make tackles. 22-Nice to see Golden make a play as a rusher. 23-We are terrible blitzing with our LBs. i can't remember the last time it got home. 24-Surprised Bettcher blitzed so much today against a guy who isn't a great passer. Seemed like a game to play coverage. 25-Mathieu did not play well today. 26-Neither did Powers. 27-Peterson was very good but also not challenged from a talent standpoint. 28-Catanzaro was good. 29-Butler punted once all game. 30-Only 5 of the 12 Rams drives were over 3 plays. The Cardinals did not have one drive of 3 plays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:31:15.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
