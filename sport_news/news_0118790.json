The Wings have lost two in a row; the Oilers have cobbled together two straight victories after starting 0-4.\nThrough their five games, the Wings have registered 107 shots on net while giving up 167.\n\"I don't think you can continue on the shot differential that we have had and have success,\" Wings coach Jeff Blashill said after the morning skate. \"It can happen in different games throughout the year, but it can't continue on a regular basis.\n\"We have to do a better job of limiting their shots. We have to do a better job of creating ours. It stems most from zone time -- we have to do a better job of getting out of our zone faster and spending more time in the other team's zone.\"\nThe Oilers average 26.8 shots per game.\nThe game promises entertainment in that it will feature two of the top teenagers in hockey in Connor McDavid and Dylan Larkin. McDavid, the top pick from this past summer, is called a generational player, while Larkin, the 15th pick from 2014, is impressing nightly playing with Henrik Zetterberg and Justin Adelkader.\nLarkin has encountered McDavid as an opponent before, including internationally.\n\"I have played against him since I was probably 12, 13,\" Larkin said. \"He has always been the talk of the rink, a player to watch.\n\"Everything, he does so well - skates with the puck at a speed not many people can do or keep up with, he makes passes that you can't even see, and you can't check him because he is too shifty. He is a tough player to play against.\"\nMcDavid, 18, has five points and a minus-3 defensive rating in six games. Larkin, 19, has six points and a plus-6 rating in five games.\nThere are no changes to the Wings' lineup, which means Per Mrazek starts in goal. Blashill did say he anticipated defenseman Brendan Smith will be back in the lineup Friday or Saturday. \"We have to keep guys playing,\" Blashill said. \"We think we have seven good ones. As a group, though, they can all play better. So that is going to be the first focus.\"\nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com.
