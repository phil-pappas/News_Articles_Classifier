I started a column of that name back when we were part of Rivals. Yes, I had it first before that other guy started using it. Anyway, here's what it would have looked like after yesterday. I think Palmer is a very, very good QB. However, he's not elite and not as good as Warner. DJ looked like a rookie, but at least a rookie with great promise. Trying to run wide is a bad tactic against the Rams . I know Iupati was just coming back from injury, but I expected the Cards should be able to run to that side a little for that kind of money. At least the Cards didn't lose any QBs! CJ was another fine Keim pickup. This game reminded me of the last few games last season when the run defense was porous. Most of it is lack of discipline with people not staying home. Special teams aren't very special when the kicker has to make two tackles. Now that 8-0 is gone will I have to listen to 7-1? I can see why they desparately took an OT in round 1. Cards lack of an impact rusher really hurt. I can see why Gresham was available. Much of the Rams win came from physical intimidation. The goal line offense and play calling was questionable at best. BA wasn't aggressive enough, which is really odd. I wrote earlier a team always loses a game it should win. Hopefully this was it. Forget it and move on, but the margin for error has narrowed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:30:51.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
