The goal of the Adirondack moose study is to gather data that will be used to create a moose management plan. \nLast February, 12 moose were captured in the Adirondacks, fitted with GPS radio collars and released. Their movements continue to be tracked remotely. Of the nine cows that were collared, seven had calves, and two of those had twins. \nThe study is also seeking information from the public regarding moose sightings to provide data. If you sight a moose, please report it to the DEC by calling the Region 5 Wildlife office at (518) 897-1291 or by completing and submitting the electronic reporting form. A link to the form can be found at the bottom of the DEC Moose web page. \nHibernating bats \nThe state is urging the public to avoid cave and mine sites that serve as homes for bat hibernations. \nHuman disturbances are seen as harmful to the state's bat population since the arrival of the disease known as white-nose syndrome, which has killed more than 90 percent of bats at most hibernation sites in the state. \nAnyone encountering hibernating bats while underground should leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. \nExperts believe that when bats are disturbed during hibernation periods, it forces them to raise their body temperatures, which causes their fat reserves to be depleted. This affects their energy levels and places the bats in a comprised state, which can often lead to death. \nFor more information about white-nose syndrome and what you can do to help see: White-nose Syndrome website (link leaves DEC at www.dec.ny.gov.) \nDave Henderson's outdoors columns appear in the Press & Sun-Bulletin on Thursday and his Field Notes columns on Sunday.
