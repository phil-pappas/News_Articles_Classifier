The rumors started flying almost as soon as the huge — for Savannah — cruise ship came around the bend and in view of Savannah’s riverfront Thursday morning.\nTourists and locals alike watched, riveted, as the 715-foot Balmorel cleared the Talmadge Bridge before docking at Ocean Terminal, where it sent as many as 1,300 passengers off for a day tour of Georgia’s oldest city.\nThe first rumor came from a tour company that announced the ship’s visit was unexpected, courtesy of Hurricane Joaquin, as operators scrambled to determine what services they could provide.\nVisit Savannah also was initially told the big ship was “sheltering from the storm.”\n“We have since learned that this was a scheduled visit,” said Erica Backus, director of public relations for the tourism bureau.\n“We are usually notified when cruise ships are coming in,” she said. “For some reason, with this one, we weren’t made aware.”\nChris Rice, director of ship operations at Georgia Ports Authority, confirmed that the Balmorel’s visit was not only expected, but planned well in advance.\n“This day trip has been booked for some time,” he said Thursday, adding that the cruise ship, which arrived in port from Charleston, was scheduled to depart later the same day for Jacksonville.\nThe ship picked up a river pilot offshore between 6 and 7 a.m. Thursday, according to Coast Guard spokesman Nathan Franklin. It was scheduled to be boarded about 6 p.m. for the trip out.\nThe Balmorel is hardly typical of cruise ships stopping in Savannah.\n“Most of the ships we get are smaller vessels, cruising the coast and docking on River Street with fewer than 100 passengers,” Backus said.\nA behemoth by comparison, the Balmoral is the newest and largest of four ships owned and operated by UK-based Fred Olsen Cruise Lines. Named for Balmorel Castle, the Scottish home of Britain’s royal family, the ship features 710 cabins and suites, three restaurants, live entertainment and a staff of more than 500.\nFor some spectators, the sight of the Balmorel brought back the old yearning for Savannah to have a cruise port of its own.\nEven Savannah alderman Tony Thomas – a longtime supporter of such a terminal – took the opportunity to post a photo of the ship on his Facebook page, reminding Savannahians of the “missed opportunities.”\nThe Bahamas-flagged Balmorel sailed from Southampton, England, Sept. 14 and is scheduled to return Oct. 19. Ports of call include Sydney, Nova Scotia; Boston, New York City, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Port Canaveral, Miami, Nassau, Bahamas; St. George, Bermuda; and Ponta Delgada, Azores.\nSenior business reporter Mary Carr Mayle covers the ports for the Savannah Morning News and savannahnow.
