The poll had a margin of error of no more than 3.5 percentage points.\nThe Federal Security Service, Russia’s main domestic security agency, said in Monday’s statement that a device with five kilograms (11 pounds) of explosives was found in a Moscow apartment rented by the suspects.\nThe FSB said some of the suspects had been trained by Islamic State militants and were plotting a terrorist attack on Moscow’s public transport. The agency didn’t immediately give further details.\nAuthorities did not say how many people were detained but said “between six and 11 people” frequented the apartment. The men had arrived in Moscow “well before” Russia began carrying out airstrikes in Syria on Sept. 30, the FSB said.\nMoscow and other Russian cities have seen numerous terror attacks linked to Islamic militants from Chechnya and other restive provinces in Russia’s volatile North Caucasus.\nThey included the suicide bombing in Moscow’s Domodedovo airport in January 2011 that killed 37 people and injured more than 180, and twin suicide bombings on the Moscow subway in March 2010 that killed 40 people and injured more than 120.\nDoku Umarov, a Chechen warlord who claimed responsibility for those bombings, also threatened but failed to strike the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.\nUmarov was reported dead in March 2014 by the militant group he led, the Caucasus Emirate, and since then some of its members have sworn loyalty to Islamic State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:55:16.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
