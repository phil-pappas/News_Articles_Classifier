Steve Kerr, who has been mostly a ghost in the background so far at the Warriors’ training camp, is expected to be with the team when it hits Southern California Friday for a week and three preseason games.\nAdChoices “I don’t know how much he’ll be involved in what we’re doing, as far as practice and games,” interim coach Luke Walton said before Thursday’s game against the Houston Rockets, in Oakland.\nKerr is recovering from the two offseason back surgeries and subsequent spinal fluid leakage, causing severe headaches. He has been at a few practices and at team headquarters, but there is no timetable for Kerr resuming full-time coaching.\n“I think it’s great,” Walton said of Kerr making the trip. “Obviously, Steve’s one of those guys, just having him around makes everything better. He wouldn’t be coming down with us at all if he was still as bad as he was, so I think (his traveling) shows signs of improvement. I don’t think it means he’ll be back (coaching) within the next two days, but all we can ask for is that he keeps getting better.”\nThe Warriors play the Lakers in San Diego Saturday, the Clippers at Staples Center Tuesday and the Lakers in Anaheim Thursday.\nScott Ostler is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.
