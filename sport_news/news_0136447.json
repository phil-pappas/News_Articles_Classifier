CAMDEN — Before their match against Camden-Frontier on Thursday night, the North Adams-Jerome Rams learned that starter Alyssa Forbes will miss the next four to six weeks with a stress fracture. “That hit the girls hard because she’s one of our big leaders on the team,” said Rams coach Kelsey Cortright. “They played for her tonight. They played very hard for her.” Down one of their senior captains, the Rams swept the Redskins with wins of 25-17, 25-18 and 25-21. North Adams-Jerome improved to 17-5 overall and 10-0 in league play. After dropping the first two set, Camden-Frontier fell behind 16-10 in third set before ralling to tie the score at 20. The Redskins ran out of steam however and were unable to extend the match. “They’re a good team,” said Camden-Frontier coach Dawn Follis. “I love playing [North Adams-Jerome]. You always get a good game out there when you play them. I love that.” Follis was overall unhappy with the way her girls performed Thursday night. “Unfortunately, most of our points came off [North Adam’s] mistakes. They hit out or they hit in the net. We didn’t earn our points tonight.” Cortright said that junior Taylor Evans filled the void that Forbes’ injury left in the Rams back row. “Taylor did an excellent job,” Cortright said. “Her serving really helps us in times of need. She’s become a consistent server.” The head coach was also happy with her frontline for their hitting and blocking at the night. “Emily Miller and Holly Trujillo did awesome tonight and took care of business,” Cortright said. Miller led the Rams in kills with 13, and also added 17 digs. Evans followed with nine kills and four blocks. Trujillo was a force at the net with seven blocks and seven kills. Kendal Cooney had 15 digs and five kills for the Redskins. Allie Teats pitched in with six assists. Gracie Cook added six kills and eight digs for North Adams-Jerome. Mayce Nunez led the team in digs with 33. Samantha Brown added 39 assists, 6 kills and 13 digs.
