Here’s a checklist of eight things they should try to accomplish as the season progresses:\nKeep the pedal to the medal\nDo whatever it takes to keep that vitriolic edge that has launched them to this strong start. The Patriots are better than anyone at using external motivational tools to their advantage, and they were given a gift in that regard with the contempt they’ve built up through Deflategate. If that means blowing teams out or throwing 50 times a game, then that’s what they should do. For that matter, especially if Bill Belichick is going to preach the importance of finishing games, give Tom Brady a chance to charge after Peyton Manning’s single-season records for touchdowns (55) and yards (5,477). Rob Gronkowski might still make a run at Randy Moss’ record for receiving touchdowns (23). Belichick isn’t a stat-oriented guy, but in the Pats’ drive to topple opponents, the stats might come as an added benefit. There’s no need to be cavalier about it, and Gronkowski should be an exception to the rule with his playing time, but as long as the game is close enough, make defenses prove they can stop him in the red zone.\nHandle the division\nThe Patriots come out of the bye week with a pair of road games against the Cowboys and Colts, and the latter is important for well-documented reasons. But it’s not as important as the five-day stretch in which the Pats host the Jets (Oct. 25) and Dolphins (Oct. 29) in Weeks 7-8. If the Patriots beat both AFC East foes, and perhaps improve to 7-0 with a 3-0 mark in the division, they’ll have the AFC East title all but locked up by November.\nGet Scott Chandler more involved\nThe 6-foot-7 tight end got off to a Herculean start during offseason workouts and training camp, but he hasn’t cracked the stat sheet as expected. He ranks sixth on the Pats with six catches and 49 yards and he has one touchdown. He ranks 14th on the team with an average of 33 offensive snaps per game. Chandler has been a factor in some combo routes with Rob Gronkowski, but if they increase those opportunities over time, it will be far more difficult to defend the pair.\nKeep Dion Lewis fresh\nThe Danny Woodhead clone has been a godsend with 325 yards from scrimmage, which ranked eighth in the NFL through three weeks, after not cracking the stat sheet for two years. Lewis has been an indispensable part of the offense. But it’s fair to wonder, since he’s never had this type of workload before, if he can sustain it for a full season due to his body type and injury history. If the Patriots are running away with a game, as they were against the Jaguars, give James White more of Lewis’ second-half snaps.\nContinue the line dances\nThe Pats’ innovative strategy to rotate their offensive linemen on a series-by-series basis has worked wonderfully, and the benefits outweigh the concerns. Keep it up, even when Bryan Stork and Ryan Wendell return to the lineup. Rookies David Andrews, Tre Jackson and Shaq Mason are gaining invaluable experience, and Josh Kline is playing well, too. Let it ride. There’s no need to settle on five linemen with such a young core.\nImprove the four-minute offense\nLeGarrette Blount was a workhorse in the second half against the Jaguars, and he helped put the game away with three touchdowns after the break. But the Patriots struggled with their four-minute offense against the Steelers and Bills, as the reliance upon the passing game bit them in the fourth quarter. Keeping the ball in Tom Brady’s hands is always a good thing, but it’s important to run the ball better in late situations. Blount’s emergence will help. A good four-minute offense is a necessity in the playoffs.\nWork in LaFell\nBrandon LaFell will come along methodically whenever he is cleared, which could be as early as Week 7 against the Jets. LaFell hasn’t practiced since before the Super Bowl, so it’s going to take him some time. Still, by adding him to a group that includes Danny Amendola and Aaron Dobson as complementary pieces to Julian Edelman, they’ll become a lot more difficult to cover down the stretch.\nMix the pass rushers\nThe Patriots’ 13 sacks were tied for the most in the NFL through three weeks, so they’re off to a great start in terms of attacking the quarterback. Jamie Collins and Jabaal Sheard have been their two most reliable rushers, and Dont’a Hightower, Chandler Jones and Rob Ninkovich have also done well. Dominique Easley figures to get going again now that he’s back from a one-game absence, and the Pats should theoretically get Trey Flowers onto the field sooner rather than later. One promising number: The Patriots have taken some of the fulltime burden off Ninkovich (84.7 percent of the snaps) and Jones (82.2 percent), which will help them down the road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:44:35.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
