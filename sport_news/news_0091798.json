The Packers went on to win 54-17. Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 6:34 pm Lee gives Packers a home run threat By Wayne Grandy moultrieobserver.com \nMOULTRIE – Sihiem King’s performance against Valdosta last year at Bazemore-Hyder Stadium is one Colquitt County fans will remember for a long time. \nHe rushed for 308 yards, including 226 in the second half alone, and scored four touchdowns as the Packers won 48-20. \nBut the Packers trailed early when Valdosta’s Brennan Goodson hit a 37-yard field goal three minutes into the game. \nAnd then it was not King who ignited the Packers offense. \nIt was Ty Lee who took a bubble screen pass from Chase Parrish and pulled away from tacklers and streaked to the end zone from 29 yards out for the Packers first touchdown. \nIt was a touchdown – and he had another against the Wildcats that night and had a crucial one against Archer in the state championship game – he cherishes. \n“Sihiem usually got the first touchdown,” Lee said this week. “So it was sweet.” \nLee had another sweet touchdown last week in the 54-17 victory at Lee County. \nHe had injured an ankle in the season-opener against North Gwinnett in the Georgia Dome and then hurt it again against Lowndes. \nIf he had any ill effects from the lingering injuries, they were not evident when he sped across the Trojans defense, grabbed a pass from Parrish, shook off a tackle and high-tailed it to the end zone for the Packers first touchdown of the game. \nIt gave Colquitt County a 12-7 first quarter lead, a lead the Packers would not surrender. \nLee grabbed five more passes in the game and finished with 127 receiving yards. He also carried the ball from scrimmage four times for 46 yards. \nAnd with 52 yards on two kickoff returns, he finished his night with 225 all-purpose yards. \nNot a bad night for a 5-foot-9, 163-pounder, who looks smaller. \n“Don’t let his size fool you,” Colquitt County offensive coordinator Sean Calhoun said. “He’s a strong kid. \n“And he’s smart with his body. He’s not going to take on a big guy head-to-head. And he’s so shifty, it’s hard to get a clean hit on him.” \nThe Packers are hoping to get Lee through tonight’s game against Valdosta with a clean bill of health and let the wheels recuperate during the off-week. \n“We’re going to need him the rest of the way,” Calhoun said. “He’s got to go.” \nBecause, Calhoun said, stating the obvious, “We’re different when he’s not in the lineup.” \nWith King now playing at the University of Kentucky and Grump Jones no longer with the team, King gives the Packers a different element when he lines up in the backfield. \nThe running back-by-committee of Nate Powell, Rafael Merritt, Nigel Hillie and Lee has been effective as the Packers have bolted to a second-straight 7-0 start. \nBut Lee’s time in the backfield has been limited because of the ankle woes. \n“We see those guys as really one guy,” Calhoun said. “But he gives us that home run threat.” \nHis pass-receiving abilities were on prominent display last year when he caught 51 balls for 856 yards and 12 touchdowns, including the soft-shoe catch on the sideline in the end zone that provided what proved to be the winning points in the state championship game. \nHe also ran for two touchdowns last year and returned a pair of punts for touchdowns. \nA preference, running from scrimmage or catching passes? \nLee just shook his head. \n“As long as I can get the ball and make plays,” he said. \nWhich is just fine with Calhoun. \n“We want to get the ball to him in different ways,” he said. \nAnd the development of Isaiah Thomas and Sheronsky Sloan has made moving Lee from receiver to the backfield much easier. \n“When Isaiah and Sloan go in there, we don’t miss a beat,” Calhoun said. \nThe Packers are likely to need Lee producing in both positions when they meet the 5-2 Wildcats at 7:30 tonight in the Hawg Pen. \n“They are very solid,” Calhoun said of the Wildcat defense. “There are no holes on their defense.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:28:01.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
