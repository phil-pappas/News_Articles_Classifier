(AP) - Navy hopes it finally has a defense that can slow 15th-ranked Notre Dame. \n“We’re playing as good as we’ve played on defense in a long time right now,” Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said. “But we also know we’re going to play a team quite frankly that we’ve had a hard time making them punt the last couple of years.” \nThe Midshipmen (4-0) forced the Fighting Irish (4-1) to punt just once last season and Notre Dame hasn’t punted at all in five of the last 10 games. The Irish have averaged 48 points a game the past four seasons. \nThe Nave defense is playing better this season, giving up 333 yards and 15 points a game. That’s 71 yards and 12 points fewer per game than last year. The defense also has allowed only one rushing touchdown. \nKelly said the defense reminds him of the 2010 squad, when the Mids beat the Irish 35-17, Navy’s last victory in the series. That the fewest points Notre Dame has scored in the series since a 14-0 victory in 1979. \n“It’s just a veteran defense. They play smart. They know what their strengths are. They know what their weaknesses are,” Kelly said. \nNiumatalolo said the challenge for Navy has been dealing with Notre Dame’s size. \n“They mash us with the football so you’ve got to get your safeties involved. Then they throw it over our heads. So it’s a tough combination for us,” he said. “If we don’t get people involved they just run it down our throats, and when we do get our guys involved, they throw it over our heads. So it’s kind of pick your poison.” \nThings to watch for when Navy plays at Notre Dame: \nTRIPLE OPTION AGAIN: Kelly said there are advantages and disadvantages to the Irish defense already having success against the triple option vs. Georgia Tech three weeks ago. \n“They’re going to look at the plan we had and dissect that and look at things they can do to attack it,” Kelly said. \nNiumatalolo agreed. \n“It helps them because their kids will be familiar with it. Sometimes we play people and it might be the only option team you see. So you’re going against conventional people for 11 weeks and then you play us,” he said. “But it also helps us too because we kind of see some of their thoughts and some of the things they tried to do against Georgia Tech.” \nRECORD PURSUIT: Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds has 73 career rushing touchdowns, four shy of the NCAA record. Kelly wants to make sure he doesn’t set the record Saturday. \n“We can’t afford for him to do that,” Kelly said. Reynolds ran for three touchdowns against the Irish in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:19:50.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
