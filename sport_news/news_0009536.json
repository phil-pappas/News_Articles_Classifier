Wright, was reassigned to keep him from a high-profile game. \nProFootballTalk.com reported Thursday that Wilson was moved to the Miami Dolphins-Tennessee Titans game in Nashville and away from the nationally televised \"Sunday Night Football\" game between the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts. Wilson's gaffe could have been a topic of discussion for the broadcast crew. \nWilson was steps away from Wright in the Week 4 game at Seattle when Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson's fumble was pushed out of the endzone intentionally by Wright for a touchback. The Seahawks took possession at their own 20 and ran out the clock for the win.
