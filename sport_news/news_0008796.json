The Hurricanes allowed 160 yards rushing, but Tech's Brenden Motley threw two interceptions and lost a fumble, which led to 10 Miami points.\nThe Hurricanes (4-2, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) bounced back from a loss a week earlier at Florida State and beat Virginia Tech (3-4, 1-2) for the second year in a row.\nAfter Tech scored a touchdown to cut Miami's lead to 23-20 midway through the fourth quarter, Kaaya led a nine-play drive and capped it by throwing a 2-yard touchdown pass to Rashawn Scott with 2:44 to go.\nArtie Burns then sealed the victory with his second interception of the game.\nWith the score 13-all late in the first half, it appeared the Hurricanes were trying to run out the clock. But on third and 20 from the Miami 11, Virginia Tech jumped offsides, and Kaaya took advantage of the free play by hitting Herb Waters with a 45-yard completion.\nFive plays later, Kaaya threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to Scott with four seconds left in the half for a 20-13 lead.\nKaaya finished 19 for 30, and the Hurricanes had no turnovers.\nMotley went 14 for 23 for 136 yards. He was replaced midway through the second half by Michael Brewer, who played for the first time since he broke his left collarbone in Tech's season-opening loss to No. 1 Ohio State.\nBrewer threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Ford, but the Hurricanes answered with their final touchdown drive.\nMiami played the last 20 minutes without middle linebacker Raphael Kirby, who was carted to the locker room with a right knee injury.\nHurricanes sophomore Michael Badgley made a career-long 49-yard field goal, and was also successful from 24 and 21 yards.\nMiami's victory should slightly ease pressure on coach Al Golden, with fan sentiment about him divided. Before the game, small planes flying over the stadium tugged banners that supported Golden and others called for his firing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:55:30.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
