Most of the players knew. \nBut Canyon High senior Natalie Tseng didn’t know. \nShe wasn’t aware her final set against Saugus sophomore Ada Hanamaikai would not only decide Thursday’s match but, in all likelihood, determine whether the Cowboys’ playoff hopes remained alive. \nApparently, she didn’t need to, winning the tight set and lifting Canyon girls tennis to a 9-9 (72-66 in games) win at Saugus High that has the Cowboys in position for a possible CIF postseason at-large bid. \nIt would be Canyon’s first playoff appearance since 2000. \n“Right after (the set) my team bombarded me and told me,” Tseng said. “The tears came down. The group hug. Just tears of joy. I’m glad to share the moment with my teammates this senior year.” \nTseng didn’t have much to celebrate with teammates in her first three varsity seasons, including an 0-10 league run in 2014. \nBut behind No. 1 single Katrina DeGuzman (who swept three sets Thursday, all 6-0), the Cowboys (8-8 overall, 4-6 in Foothill) have made major strides this season, highlighted by a collective third-place finish at Valencia’s Fall Brawl. \nIt was up to Tseng on Thursday to keep the good times rolling. \nSaugus’ Megan Cho and Carlie Ozaki had won their third-round doubles set 6-1 to put the Centurions ahead 9-8 in sets. But Canyon led 65-61 in games, with only Tseng and Hanamaikai still playing. \nHanamaikai, regularly a JV player and playing in her first varsity match, came from behind to tie the set 5-5, but Tseng won the final two games. \n“I’m proud of her,” Saugus head coach Ken Jeffris said of Hanamaikai. “There was a lot of pressure. She did everything she could do, and they got us again.” \nThe again he referred to is the teams’ first meeting this season, which Canyon won 9-9 (72-62 in games). \nThursday’s matchup had more on the line, as a Saugus win would’ve put the teams in a tie for fourth place and put both squads’ playoff hopes in doubt. \nCanyon isn’t guaranteed a spot, as Saugus finished in fourth place with a 9-8 overall record in 2014, making the playoffs only in the former. \n“It’s still rewarding to have a chance,” Canyon head coach Richard Bristow said of the uncertainty. \nOzaki and Cho won their other two sets 6-0 for Saugus (6-11, 2-8). \nAnd DeGuzman ran her league record to 30-0 on the year. \nValencia 13, Hart 5 \nThe Vikings, already crowned outright Foothill League champions on Tuesday, capped off their second straight 10-0 run through league on Thursday at Hart High. \nValencia (16-3, 10-0) won eight of nine doubles sets, led by a sweep from its No. 1 team of Lauren Wolf and Gianna Benitez. \nVikings Amanda Tabanera and Jennifer Shin each won two sets, losing only to Hart No. 1 Natalia Munoz. \nMunoz, a senior, swept her three sets to finish her regular-season league career unbeaten. \nHart finished in third place with a 9-8 overall record and a 6-4 league mark. \nWest Ranch 18, Golden Valley 0 \nThe Wildcats (14-3, 8-2) lost just seven games on the day, led by three 6-0 sweeps each from Una Stanisavljevic and the pairing of Cori Raffish and Quinterra Walter-Eze. \nEmily Andrews and Joan Kim both won three sets in singles. \nThe Grizzlies finished the year 1-16 overall and 0-10 in league.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:31:29.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
