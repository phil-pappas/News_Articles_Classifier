Laid-back, Southern-style. And closing for a month to do so.\nThe plan to become a “laid-back Southern hangout” will begin with its closing Nov. 1 so the team can transform the 3-year-old Carriage House space at 1700 W. Division St. into CH Bar + Provisions in time for an early to mid-December opening date.\n“We love the idea of Carriage House, and it had a great Southern philosophy and, really, Southern hospitality being at the heart of that philosophy,” said Matt Mering, managing partner of Carriage House and The Bedford. “We just felt it was the right time to tweak things. ... There’s a certain formality that goes along with a finer-dining restaurant and Michelin Bib Gourmand type of establishment. We wanted to kind of take the formality down a notch and make it more accessible to the neighborhood and really take the great qualities of Carriage House and kind of extend the brand.”\nThink of it as a Southern backyard gathering, with a Charleston accent, serving favorites from the Carriage House menu, including fried chicken in buckets, fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits. Carriage House executive chef Mike Galen will oversee the CH Bar + Provisions kitchen, creating new dishes and building plans for a biscuit program. “So the buttermilk is kind of the classic, and we’re going to be playing around with that,” said Mering.\nAdding to the emphasis on community: punch bowls and communal tables. “The heart of the concept is community and the feeling of a backyard barbecue ambience,” Mering told us. “The punch bowls are a communal concept, and they’re fun.”\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625465e/turbine/ct-carriage-house-to-become-a-laidback-southern-hangout-20151019", "http://chprovisions.com/"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:30:56.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
