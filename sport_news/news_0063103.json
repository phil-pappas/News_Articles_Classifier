(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh's message did not vary from his postgame comments to his appearance on the \"Inside Michigan Football\" show on Sunday morning.\nHarbaugh discussed the final botched punt that led to Jalen Watts-Jackson going 38 yards on the fumble recovery for the winning touchdown in the 27-23 Michigan State victory with no time remaining in the game Saturday at Michigan Stadium.\n\"We messed it up,\" Harbaugh said on the show. \"Didn't field the ball cleanly. Talked to (punter) Blake (O'Neill), he said he thought he felt he had time to get it off and get it kicked, but he didn't, not nearly enough. Tried to kick it and the ball landed in the Spartans' hands and they returned it for a touchdown.\n\"We'll move forward with more steel in our spine and resolve. Unfortunate circumstances that happened, and we'll move on.\"\nThe Michigan players who appeared on the weekly wrap-up show were blunt in their assessment.\n\"It just sucks, there's no other way to phrase it no better way to put it,\" quarterback Jake Rudock said. \"Just kind of numb to it.\"\nLinebacker Desmond Morgan praised the Michigan State offense but said it was a difficult way to lose.\n\"You can't discredit the ability of (MSU quarterback) Connor Cook and those offensive guys,\" Morgan said. \"They definitely have a potent offense. But for us coming into the game it was something we thought we could match up well and we did at times. There were times we definitely had mistakes we have to go back and clean up.\n\"It sucks, there's really no other way to put it. Our guys fought hard. They fought for 60 full minutes, but there's no way to point fingers or anything like ... there's a lot of things throughout the game that could have changed the way that game went. To lose like that, it's very unfortunate.\"\nHarbaugh was asked if it's a good thing Michigan does not have a game on Saturday — the Wolverines next play Oct. 31 at Minnesota — or would he prefer to have a game for which to prepare this week.\n\"I don't know which is better,\" Harbaugh said. \"We'll just keep forging ahead with great resolve.\n\"It was hard, physical, hard-fought game. I thought our guys did what they needed to do in the situations to be successful. You don't come away with the result, that's tough, but you move on.\"\nThat was the message fullback Sione Houma, who scored two touchdowns in the game, also shared on the show.\n\"We're going to learn from it,\" Houma said. \"We've got to keep our heads held high. We can't let this game just faze us like that. We have to prepare in two weeks. Just got to get back up during our bye week and keep moving forward.\"\nangelique.chengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:39:20.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
