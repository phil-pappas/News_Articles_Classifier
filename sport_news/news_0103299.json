It was a heartbreaking loss for India, who at one point led 2-1 before losing the match 4-3 in the sudden death. Great Britain, last year’s losing finalists, made it 2-2 to take the match into the tiebreaker. In the shootout, both the teams stood level — two successes each — at the end of their first five attempts. And then in the sudden death, India missed their second penalty before Great Britain converted to deny India their third successive title. “Penalty shootouts are always unpredictable and it’s unfortunate that we couldn’t win. I am completely satisfied with the boys’ performance and I couldn’t have asked for more from them,” said India coach Harendra Singh. “I would like to congratulate Great Britain on being crowned the new champions.” It was Great Britain that drew first blood in the fifth minute through a penalty corner goal by Luke Taylor. Great Britain, who had defeated India in the league match, seemed to be in control until India were awarded a penalty corner in the 12th minute. Harmanpreet Singh converted it to take his tournament tally to four goals. The second half began with India pressing hard and they were soon rewarded in the 42nd minute with Gurjant Singh pulling off an absolute stunner. Great Britain, however, struck four minutes later through Jack Turner to draw level.
