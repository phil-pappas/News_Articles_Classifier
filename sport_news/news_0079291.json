Wyoming mustered only 233 yards, its lowest output of the season. \nRypien's night started more positively than a week ago when he was 6-of-15 passing with two interceptions and two lost fumbles in the first five possessions during the Broncos' 52-26 loss to Utah State. \nAgainst Wyoming, Rypien completed 13 of his first 14 passes for 102 yards and two touchdowns in staking Boise State to an early lead. \nRypien started the scoring by hitting Thomas Sperbeck on a 13-yard touchdown pass on the Broncos' opening drive. Tyler Rausa's 39-yard field goal pushed Boise State's lead to 10-0, and McNichols bulled his way into the end zone on a 1-yard run. \nWith 7:37 left in the second quarter, Rypien connected with McNichols for a 4-yard scoring strike to give the Broncos a 24-0 advantage. \nWyoming scored its first points with less than a minute before halftime when Cam Coffman hit Jake Maulhardt for a 15-yard touchdown pass, cutting the deficit to 24-7. \nA 36-yard scoring pass from Rypien to Sperbeck along with a 28-yard field goal by Rausa gave Boise State a 34-7 lead late in the third quarter. \nWyoming tried to fight back, but had to do so without Coffman, who left the field favoring his right shoulder and never returned. Backup quarterback Nick Smith engineered an 11-play, 83-yard drive that ended when he plowed into the end zone on a 6-yard run. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:51:51.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
