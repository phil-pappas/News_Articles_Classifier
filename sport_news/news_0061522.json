The 5-foot-11, 210-pound Milwaukee native also had a fanatical work ethic and gritty determination that drove him to become Carthage College's career leader in rushing, to play in the NFL for seven seasons and to return the opening kickoff in Super Bowl XIV in 1980.\n\"His whole life was about working harder than the next guy,\" said Tom Brannon, a lifelong friend who grew up with Jodat in Milwaukee and now lives in California. \"Everything he got he earned through hard work.\"\nThe former Milwaukee prep star and Carthage record holder died early Wednesday at his home in Lake Forest, Calif., after a nine-month battle with cancer. He was 61. He is survived by his former wife, Debra, and daughters Ashley and Hailey.\nJodat was born March 3, 1954, in Milwaukee, and became a legendary athlete at the old Pio Nono High School, which would later become St. Thomas More. He played football for four seasons, wrestled for three — going 33-0 in 1972 — and ran track for four seasons. In all, he won 10 varsity letters, graduated in 1972, and was inducted into St. Thomas More Hall of Fame in 1997.\nJodat turned down offers from several Big Ten schools to attend Kenosha's Carthage, where he rushed for a school-record 4,079 yards from 1972 to 1975. A fireplug of a back, Jodat rushed for more than 200 yards in four games for the Red Men, topped by his 253-yard outburst in October 1973, a 41-14 win over North Central (Ill.).\n\"Jim was tenacious as a player,\" said John Brannon, Tom's younger brother who lives in Milwaukee. \"I went to all those Carthage games and loved those Saturday afternoons. He was intense when it came to sports, but Jim always had a big smile on his face.\"\nJodat left Carthage as the career rushing leader in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin with 3,524 yards. He was inducted to the Carthage College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1984.\n\"The passing of Jim Jodat is a great loss to the Carthage community,\" said Robert Bonn, Carthage's director of athletics. \"Not many Division III football players become professional athletes or have successful careers in the NFL. Jim was one of the best Red Men football players in Carthage history and a first-rate person. Our deepest condolences go out to his family and friends.\"\nIn 1976, Jodat was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the 12th round of the NFL draft, the 344th overall pick. He went on to play with the Rams, the Seattle Seahawks and the San Diego Chargers over seven seasons.\nJodat spent his rookie season on injured reserve with a sprained knee. In 1977 he made his mark on special teams, since the Rams' backfield was clogged with talented backs John Cappelletti, Lawrence McCutcheon, Cullen Bryant and Wendell Tyler.\n\"He was behind a lot of great players with the Rams, but Jim was a never a guy to try and talk a coach into more playing time,\" Tom Brannon said. \"He just didn't have that kind of personality.\"\nIn January 1980, Jodat appeared on the cover of The Sporting News as the special teams captain for the Rams. He returned the opening kickoff for Los Angeles in Super Bowl XIV against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers won, 31-19, after the Rams let a 19-17 lead dissolve in the fourth quarter.\nAfter the Super Bowl season, the Rams dealt Jodat to the Seattle Seahawks for a fifth-round draft choice. In Seattle, Jodat finally got the ball, rushing for 632 yards and five touchdowns. He was released by Seattle in 1981 and picked up by the San Diego Chargers. He spent two seasons on special teams before retiring. In all, he rushed for 866 yards and seven touchdowns, and caught 35 passes for 265 yards and two scores.\nAfter his playing days, Jodat stayed in California and taught troubled and disabled students in the Alternative and Correction program for the Orange County (Calif.) Department of Education.\nJodat learned he had cancer in January and battled the disease with the same zeal he worked out or go after linebackers, Tom Brannon said. \"He fought as hard as anyone ever could,\" he said. \"He was in so much pain, but he would never say a word.\"\nInstead, Jodat kept exercising, watching his diet, and painstakingly documenting his workout routines — something he had done since he was 12.\n\"He was a great athlete, a great father, a great teacher and a great friend,\" Brannon said. \"When he talked to kids, it was always about what they could do. It was never about what he did.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/335491361/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:34:18.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
