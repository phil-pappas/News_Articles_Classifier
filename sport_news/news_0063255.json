The setback, coupled with Spokane’s 3-0 victory over North Idaho on Saturday, allowed the Sasquatch to move one point in front of both the Warriors and CBC. The Hawks improved to 5-4 in the East and 6-5-1 overall. Walla Walla is now 4-2-3 and 6-2-5. “It was a disappointing performance,” Walla Walla coach Ben Rotert said. “For whatever reason, we weren’t mentally sharp. We weren’t as sharp as we needed to be.” Saturday’s contest was a scoreless draw until the 44th minute when CBC’s Jesus Adame accepted a free kick from the midfield area, dribbled inside the 18, and rocketed a shot past Walla Walla goalie Francisco Flores to give the Hawks a 1-0 edge and seemingly a significant lift going into halftime. “I thought we were really good in the first 43 minutes,” Rotert said. “We were doing what we needed to.” The Warriors had two excellent scoring chances early in the second half. Defender Franky Torres blasted a point-blank shot in the 52nd minute, only to have it stopped by CBC keeper Max Ramos. Midfielder Emilio Meraz-Rodriguez dribbled through the Hawks’ defense for an opportunity one minute later, but delivered a shot high and wide. “We came at them at the start of the second half,” Rotert said. CBC put the match away with goals in both minutes 61 and 62. Jair Dominguez hammered home a free kick from 20 yards out on the left side and Xavier Valencia added an in-close try for the final tally of the match. WWCC frustration hit its peak in the 78th minute when Meraz-Rodriguez was stoned by Ramos on a penalty kick. “Things didn’t go our way today,” Rotert said. Walla Walla’s next match is Wednesday at Spokane. “We’ve proven we can bounce back,” Rotert said. “We need to focus up, prepare, and go back to work on Monday.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:51:53.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
