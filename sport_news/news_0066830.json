ARMAS\nAP Sports Writer GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - Aaron Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and 241 yards, and the Green Bay Packers held off the St. Louis Rams for a 24-10 win on Sunday in spite of three turnovers by their normally mistake-free quarterback.\nRodgers connected with receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones for long scoring strikes.\nBut NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis' diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3).\nRodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third.\nRelentless pressure on quarterback Nick Foles helped keep the Packers (5-0) unbeaten. Foles threw a career-worst four interceptions, two in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
