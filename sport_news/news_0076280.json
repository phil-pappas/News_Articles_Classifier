It was reminiscent of the 2013 game at Hillsborough, which was delayed two hours at the start before the Stateliners pulled away for a 31-21 victory. \nFriday night’s game had, among other things, a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by the Raiders’ Jackson Parham called back because of a holding penalty. \nP’burg converted four fourth down conversions and had another one on a fake punt taken back because of a penalty. \nBut the one play that perhaps stood out the most was a bizarre incident that occurred early in the second quarter. It was probably the most unusual play of the season. \nRELATED : P'burg football team holds off Hillsborough \nP’burg (4-1) led 7-0 but Hillsborough (1-4) was driving with a third-and-8 at the Stateliners’ 22. Raiders quarterback Joe Schultz took off on a run up the middle and would have had the first down except he was stripped by defensive end Zach Troxell . Stateliners safety Yusef Shelton picked up the loose ball and began running the other way. \nShelton was then stripped of the ball and Hillsborough’s Jimmy Suseck recovered at P’burg’s 26 to give the Raiders a fresh set of downs. \nThree plays later, Shelton redeemed himself for the fumble by intercepting Schultz to end the threat. It was Shelton’s fourth interception in the last three games. \nJunior defensive lineman Robert Melise had an outstanding game for P’burg with two sacks and a fumble recovery. \nNot surprisingly, it was senior star Manny Romero who ultimately made the biggest impact. The running back and safety started out in the backfield and ran four times for 14 yards on P’burg’s first possession. \nAfter intercepting a pass on defense, the versatile Romero was inserted as a wide receiver on the Stateliners’ next series. Quarterback Danny Fisher faked to Ja’Quan Jones out of the backfield before rifling a 33-yard touchdown pass over the middle to Romero, giving P’burg a 7-0 lead with 7:56 left in the first quarter. \nIt was just the beginning of what would be yet another big night for Romero. His 1-yard touchdown run gave P’burg a 21-7 lead with 3:10 left in the third quarter. Three plays after Hillsborough pulled within 21-14, Romero turned in perhaps the play of the year. \nOn third-and-6 from P’burg’s 42, quarterback Zach Ringhoff connected with Romero on a screen pass. Romero broke one tackle to get enough yardage for the first down. He stayed on his feet and broke another tackle, and yet another. Before he was through, Romero eluded at least six potential Hillsborough tacklers and completed a sensational 58-yard touchdown. \nThe play gave the Stateliners a 28-14 lead with 11:05 remaining, and ultimately turned out to be the winning score. \nRomero had one more big play left in his arsenal. His 3-yard run on fourth-and-1 sealed the verdict with under a minute remaining. \nEach week Romero seems to do something extraordinary. And this week was certainly no exception.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:22:23.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
