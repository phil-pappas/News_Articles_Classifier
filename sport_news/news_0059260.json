Rigoletto (Kingda Ka - Highland Ghillie) is owned by KN Dhunjibhoy & his family, owner of Nanoli stud farm which sponsors the Pune Derby, while Continental (Rip Van Winkle - Samsa) is a got abroad owned by Shapoor Mistry & DR Thacker.\nRigoletto will be ridden by Trevor Patel, while Continental will be ridden by Suraj Narredu.\nOthers who may hope to shine if this duo falters are the Cooji Katrak-trained Bullrun, whose last victory was much more impressive than it looked to the naked eye, and Bold Appeal, who was putting in some good work in the final furlong of the recently run S A Poonawalla Million, and now with Sandesh replacing Neeraj Rawal, could be treated as the proverbial dark horse.\nThere is yet another talented filly in the fray, Intelligence trained by Vishal Gaikwad, but she is running too quickly after her last victory and may suffer on that account.\nAll said, though there is very little to choose between Rigoletto & Continental on paper, I choose the former only because he has won over this trip of 2,000 meters.\nFirst race at 12.30 pm.\nSelections:\nJimmy Umrigar Trophy - Div II (For 3y, maidens; 1400m)\nSans Peur 1, Charging Tigress 2, Remember The Time 3.\n\nPune Police Commissioner's Trophy - Div II (Class III; 1200m)\nMaleficent 1, Ashrafie 2, Zeda 3.\nSir Sultan Chinoy Trophy - Div I (Class IV; 1000m)\nCannonball Run 1, Zaheazaan 2, Zadora 3.\nVivanta by Taj - Blue Diamond Trophy (class IV; 2400m)\nGeromino 1, Alanzo 2, Vitesse 3.\nAnimal Welfare Board of India Cup (Class V; 1000m)\nTrue Heir 1, Pezzonovante 2, Polar Zone 3.\n\nJimmy Umrigar Trophy - Div I (For 3y, maidens; 1400m)\nSilvano 1, Aurelio 2, Baker Street 3.\nNoshir & Dolly Dhunjibhoy Sprint Million (Grade 3) (For 4y; 1200m)\nSenorita Evita 1, Dancing Phoenix 2, Brynhill 3.\nNanoli Stud Pune Derby (Grade 1) (For 3y; 2000m)\nRigoletto 1, Continental 2, Bold Appeal 3.\nPune Police Commissioner's Trophy - Div I (Class III; 1200m) \nLucky Charm 1, Sunny Sea 2, Desert Rage 3.\nSir Sultan Chinoy Trophy - Div II (Class IV; 1000m) \nHirohama 1, Abbey 2, Spear Of Trium 3.\nRecommendations\nBest bet: None\nGood bet: Maleficent (2-7)\nChance bet: Sans Peur (1-9)\nUpset: Zafirah (5-7) & Rosie Sunshine (7-5)\nToday's pools\nSuper jackpot pool: 5,6,7,8,9,10 \nJackpot pool: I - 4,5,6,7,8; II - 6,7,8,9,10\nTreble pool: I - 3,4,5; II - 7,8,9; III - 8,9,10 \nTanala pool: All races.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:56:09.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
