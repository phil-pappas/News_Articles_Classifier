The reduction is a good sign for commuters as any increase in CNG price affects the fares of autos, taxis and BEST buses in Mumbai.\nSix lakh households in the Mumbai metropolitan region depend on piped gas while nearly four lakh vehicles run on the CNG.\nThe spokesperson further said : \"Once the revision comes into effect from Friday morning, the price of CNG will be Rs 41.90 per kg in Mumbai and that of piped gas will be Rs 25.31 per unit (scm).''\nThe price reduction will also affect the municipalities adjoining Mumbai after factoring in implications of local municipal octroi/LBT and cess rates. The revised prices (inclusive of local taxes) of CNG will be in the range of Rs 41.90 to Rs 42.85 per Kg while for domestic piped gas, it will be in the range of Rs 25.31 per unit to Rs 25.62 per unit across the Mumbai region.\n\"With this reduction in CNG prices, the gas supplied by MGL continues to be a very attractive proposition to consumers and offers saving of about 58% and 20% as compared to petrol and diesel respectively -- as compared to current petrol and diesel prices in Mumbai,'' the spokesperson added.
