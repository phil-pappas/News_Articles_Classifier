My Twitter, Facebook and other accounts are almost old enough to vote.\nSnapchat was different. Maybe it was because it's so targeted toward a younger audience. It wasn't until a colleague of mine started waxing poetic about it that I really started to pay attention. And now, I can't imagine going a day without snapping.\nBut just because I like it and appreciate it doesn't mean you will — or should. Still, you really have to try it to have an informed opinion. So rather than just telling you to download it and see what you think, I'll give you tips to get you snapping like a pro in no time at all. Once you get going, it's quite simple.\nTIP: Mix photos and video\nThis couldn't be easier. Press the camera button for a photo; hold it down for a video.\nTIP: Add text to your photos\nTake your photo, and then tap on the screen to bring up the cursor. If the little type isn't your style, hit the \"T\" button to get a bigger option.\nTIP: Add color to your text\nIf you hit the \"T\" to get bigger text, you can then select a word or a portion of a word and use the color slider to change the appearance of the letters. Few things make you stand out on Snapchat like a rainbow word.\nTIP: Add emojis to your snaps\nBecause you can never have enough emojis. After you take your photo, you'll see an icon next to the \"T\" that looks like a piece of paper. That lets you add emojis. You can add a whole bunch if you want, and you can make them as big or small as you want by simply pinching and dragging on your screen.\nTIP: Add black and white to your text\nThe color palette is great, but you'll notice there's no black or white. If you drag your finger down or up off the edges of the slider, you'll see white appear on one side and black on the other. And in between are silver and pink. You may need to play around with this to get the hang of it, but you'll impress your friends.\nTIP: Rainbow eyes and more selfie fun\nSnapchat recently introduced fun selfie enhancements. To try them, turn the camera around, so you are in the frame. Then, place your thumb on your face and hold until you see a secondary menu pop-up. Again, you may need to do this a few times to get used to it — it can be hit-or-miss. And here's another tip: These change often, so check back to see what's new, and make sure you enjoy because there's no guarantee your favorites will come back.\nTIP: Snapping with a friend is different from a story\nSnapping with a friend is private, and your friend can see your snap for a matter of seconds — and possibly replay it depending on your settings. A story makes your snap visible to your friends and potentially everyone on Snapchat for 24 hours.\nTIP: Animate your Snap code avatar\nThat ghost on your profile is scannable. People can use the Snapchat camera to add you as a friend. Tap on your snapcode to get the camera button. Then, get ready because the camera will snap 5 shots of you in succession. If you hate it or want to try again, just hit the little ghost with the arrow in the upper left corner to revert.\nTIP: Yes, Snapchat does have video chat\nIn Snapchat's chat screen, you'll see a yellow camera icon. If this person is talking with you, the icon turns blue. If you and the person you are talking to hold down this button at the same time, it initiates a live video chat a la Facetime or Skype.\nI can't fit every single tip into this space, but this should get you going.
