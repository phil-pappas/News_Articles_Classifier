Holmes to lose 3&2.\nThe only bright spot for the Internationals was the South African pairing of Branden Grace and Louis Oosthuizen, who defeated Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed 3&2 to put a touch of blue on a red-hued scoreboard.\nInternationals skipper Nick Price said his team was down but not out. After winning just one of the 10 previous Presidents Cups the Internationals were thought to have their best chance in years in Korea, the first Asian country to host the event, after the PGA Tour agreed to reduce the points on offer to 30 from 34.\nHowever, that format change and home advantage seemed to do little to inspire the International team, which found itself trailing in every match by the second hole.\nThe Presidents Cup continues Friday and Saturday with foursome and four ball match-ups, before wrapping up Sunday with 12 head-to-head singles matches.\nAlison Lee, Xi Yu Lin share lead\nIn Malaysia, Alison Lee shot a 6-under 65 Thursday for a share of the first-round lead in the LPGA Malaysia, the first tour event since her emotional Solheim Cup debut.\nLee birdied five of the first eight holes at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club, and added birdies on Nos. 12 and 14. The 20-year-old UCLA student bogeyed the par-3 17th and — after rain and lightning delayed play more than three hours — got up-and-down for par on the par-4 18th.\nChina’s Xi Yu Lin matched Lee at 65. Michelle Wie was a stroke back along with defending champion Shanshan Feng, Yani Tseng and Chella Choi. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:32:09.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
