In order to make fishing trips more convenient, an inventor from Jacksonville, Fla., conceived of a solution to this common problem. The patent-pending FISHERMAN COOLER enhances convenience for fishing trips. It provides an easy way to store food, beverages and caught fish. It also facilitates the transport of rods and other items. Versatile and ergonomic, it also can be used at a beach or picnic.\nThe original design was submitted to the Jacksonville office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
