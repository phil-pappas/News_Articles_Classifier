They were just a little bit more plentiful for the home town Knights. Lourdes enjoyed a 46-12 lead in the late first half and held off a second half charge to pull away from Cedar Bluffs for a 78-48 win. Cedar Bluffs completed a long pass in the final seconds of the first half, fumbled, recovered and advanced the ball inside the Knight 5-yard line before calling time out with less than a second on the game clock. A short scoring pass and two-point pass made it 46-20 at half. Cedar Bluffs scored twice in the second half to cut the Knight lead to 46-36, but that was as close as the visitors could get. Kyle Francois led the Knights with five rushing touchdowns. Also scoring touchdowns for the Knights were Thomas Ragland, Nick Whitten, Colter Fulton, and Hayden Miller. Lourdes, 7-0, will travel to East Butler for the final regular season game of the season on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:22:30.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
