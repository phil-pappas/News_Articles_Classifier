But that’s simplifying it. It is the reason for all of life, basis of all life processes and biochemical reactions occurring on Earth, the reason why thousands of species have thrived and evolved over billions of years. A layman knows he is beholden to water for his existence, future wars may be fought over it, it impacts world climate, and very recently, liquid water has been found on Mars. What he now needs to grasp is the how and why of it —how this frozen water, also found on moons of Jupiter and Saturn, got there in the first place; why does it not flow as liquid; why does it behave different from the water, as we know it, on Earth; why life may or may not be possible outside of our planet; why Earth may go the same way as Mars (its spitting image, only smaller, 3.5 billion years ago) once its magnetic field begins to weaken and its core starts to solidify — luckily not anytime soon — in a few billion years. Appearing to have a mind of its own, this fragile and critical resource resists the definitive theory of liquids. Consider this: The rules of chemistry say Earth should have no liquid oceans, with all the water existing as a giant vapour spread, for its molecules are made from two very light molecules, which should, logically, make it a gas. Life across all domains contains water, ranging from 50 to 97 per cent. An adult human weighing 70 kg, for instance, is made up of 42 litres of water, of which 28 litres are in the cells; thirst pangs arise, surprisingly, with a loss of only 1 per cent of the normal water content in the body. Sixteen known phases of ice exist, each with a unique crystal structure. Of all the water on Earth, only 1 per cent is available for the consumption of both humans and animals. That said, Jha takes one on the far side of water-is-precious-save-it refrain. Aboard a scientific vessel, and among palaeoclimatologist scientists, oceanographers, zoologists and ecologists, he sets sail on a resplendent ocean trip to the glorious ice sheets and giant bergs of Antarctica, covered by an estimated ten thousand trillion tonnes of snow and ice. Battling the ferocious katabatic winds (blowing at an astounding 250 kph) and funereal weather, the rugged journey across the Southern Ocean — the roughest sea in the world — is neither facile nor a piece of cake, as scientists struggle to gather ice core samples to unlock the secrets of time embedded in the deepest layers of the enchanting continent. The book follows two main threads: What makes water, with its baffling chemical and physical properties, absolutely necessary for all the chemical reactions that abet life; and two, is there water on other planets, enough to have sustained life forms in the primordial past, or have hopes of doing so with human intervention in outer space. The book is dense: Writing reams on the seemingly no-brainer phenomenon of water is complex enough as it is. Jha has lent an engaging perspective, gleaned information from the many space missions across decades, offered explanations by way of exhaustive research and long hours at NASA facilities in California, and with scientists whose business it is to go beyond the preliminaries to study the impact of water on humankind and Earth. Even so, some mysteries will remain, for future generations of scientists and space missions to make some sense of. In that, this book will find its way into the hands of a curious, serious reader. That’s where it rightfully belongs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:09:02.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
