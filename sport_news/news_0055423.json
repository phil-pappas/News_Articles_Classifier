His track record is marked by success. He is thoughtful, respectful and he has excellent business judgement,\" American great and WTA founder Billie Jean King said. \nWorld number one Serena Williams added: \"I know how much he cares about the opinions of the players. He's a good listener and he has our best interests in mind.\" \nSimon is expected to take up his appointment with the WTA full time from Nov. 30. \n(Reporting by Pritha Sarkar, editing by Ken Ferris) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
