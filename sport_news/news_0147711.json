He was hugely respectful of the club in taking this decision and he acted 100 per cent in our best interests. \n\"It is also testament to his character that he has forgone any kind of a financial settlement, something which is very unusual in football. \n\"While this isn't a situation any of us envisaged being in, what is important now is that we regroup quickly and focus on the rest of the season.\" \nAdvocaat's departure came less than 24 hours after his side's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw with West Ham, which lifted them off the foot of the table, if only on goal difference. \nThey are yet to win a league game this season and have collected only three of the 24 points they have contested so far. \nAdvocaat said: \"This is a very special football club with so many great people, but I feel it is the right time to do this - not for me, but for the club. \n\"I have made the decision to go after only eight games as I felt it was important to give everyone time turn things around - like we did last year.\" \nIt is understood Allardyce, former Leicester boss Nigel Pearson and Burnley's Sean Dyche are among those interesting Sunderland, who are also considering up and coming managers such as Karl Robinson of MK Dons and Burton's Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.
