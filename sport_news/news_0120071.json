We didn’t have a lot of teamwork on the court in the first three and a half games, and we were able to put it together in the fourth and fifth games as a team, I think, and that was great. It was a great feeling to see our players play together like that. \n“Both of the Harlingen schools play well at home,” Hagemann added. “We saw that when (Brownsville) Veterans (Memorial) played at Harlingen South (and needed five games to win last week). Those Harlingen teams are forces at home, and that was shown today, and of course, the Lady Cardinals are fighting for a playoff spot. They played with a lot of heart and a high energy level. They came out to beat us, and it took us a while to find our way in the match, but our girls came through.” \nThird-place Hanna (23-12, 7-2 district) was coming off last Tuesday’s four-game victory at home against fourth-place San Benito (4-5). During the first round of district, the Lady Golden Eagles had five-game matches that they won against San Benito and Rivera. They had previously swept the Lady Cardinals in three games during the opening round of district. \nThe Lady Cardinals (3-6), still alive for the playoffs, were coming off last Tuesday’s five-game victory at Rivera (3-6). \nLos Fresnos (9-0) and Brownsville Veterans (8-1), defending district co-champions, are the top two teams in the 32-6A standings. \n“Yes, it was a very close match,” Lady Cardinals coach Jennifer Martinez said. “We just need to finish. We lost our focus today. Our girls fight hard, but it’s a mental game that we play. But we’re all right. We’re going to refocus and keep going. There’s a lot of volleyball left, and we’ve got a lot of work to do. We’re going to do whatever it takes to get into the playoffs.” \nRoy Hess covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
