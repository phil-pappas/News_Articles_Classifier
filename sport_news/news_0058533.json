(AP) - For Purdue seniors Frankie Williams and Danny Anthrop, it’s time to dump the moral victories in exchange for a real one. \nThat opportunity will come Saturday, when the Boilermakers (1-4, 0-1 Big Ten) play Minnesota (3-2, 0-1) in Ross-Ade Stadium, where third-year Purdue coach Darrell Hazell is 0-8 in Big Ten games. \nWhile the Boilermakers have beaten only Indiana State, they were in a position to win during the final two minutes against Marshall, Bowling Green and then this past Saturday at No. 4 Michigan State, which hung on for a 24-21 victory. \nWhile the Golden Gophers had won three in a row until this past Saturday’s loss at Northwestern, they have scored only 37 total points in their 12 most recent quarters and rank last in the Big Ten in scoring at 15.4 points a game and last in rushing offense at 141.2 yards a game. \nPurdue is seeking its first conference home victory since beating Indiana 56-35 on Nov. 24, 2012. Overall, the Boilermakers are 1-16 - a victory last season at Illinois - in Hazell’s first 17 Big Ten games. \nVeteran defensive back Williams said Purdue is ready to take the next step. \n“The time definitely is now,” Williams said Tuesday. “I wouldn’t even say this is a potential (victory) week. I will say this is the week. It has been a long time since any of us has won a Big Ten home game. That can start if when our offense turns the ball over, we bow our backs and not allow any points.” \nWide receiver Anthrop, who grew up only several miles from the Purdue campus and who has been attending Purdue football games since elementary school, senses this team is on the brink of winning. \n“This weekend is going to be big for us,” Anthrop said. “It’s going to be huge for us. We have had a lot of close games, especially this last one at Michigan State. We learned a lot from that, although you never want to have moral victories. \n“But what we showed in the second half at Michigan State is going to be huge for us to build on the momentum from that.” \nHazell doesn’t want to make too much of a single game, but understands the significance, especially to a fan base that is unhappy with his 5-24, three-season record. \n“All games are important, to be honest with you, none more than others,” Hazell said. “But we’re striving hard to win those (home) games. Every single game’s important in this profession. Absolutely you want your home field to be an advantage, and we will keep talking about that - protecting your home territory.” \nHere are other things to watch this weekend: \nNO DATE SWITCH: Because this weekend is fall break at Purdue - most students, faculty and staff will be away from campus - athletic director Morgan Burke asked Minnesota to move this game to Oct. 24, a bye week for both teams. However, the Gophers refused. \nBeginning in 2018, the Big Ten will take Purdue’s early October break into consideration when scheduling, but the 2017 Minnesota at Purdue game (Oct. 7) also will be played during the Boilermakers’ fall break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:08:55.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
