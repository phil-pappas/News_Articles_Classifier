Two frontrunners were buying market share with cash by the truckload, and a handful of would-be third-placers were actually shoveling cash into a furnace. It was so crazy and yet it feels so familiar right now . Anyway, does anybody read those Groupon emails any more? \nLet's assume daily fantasy isn't a fad--that DraftKings and FanDuel are buying users who will stick around. DraftKings still faces the Aereo scenario. Like Aereo, DraftKings is a company charging hard at an opportunity, knowing a change in regulation could shut it down. What happened last night in Nevada shows how quickly that can happen. \nThe difference is Aereo had every powerful interest allied against it. Only the lowly consumer was rooting for Aereo to win. Daily fantasy, on the other hand, has the allegiance of leagues (all are investors except the NFL) and team owners (Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft). Presumably Jones and Kraft have read Ernest Hemingway, who understood the marketing power of a wager: It's the reason people go to horse races, not bicycle races. \nOwnership's enthusiasm for daily fantasy shows the third way for DraftKings and the outcome that's most worth betting on, in which some forms of sports gambling (or daily fantasy) are legalized (something like what NBA Commissioner Adam Silver argued for last year). That could be bad news for DraftKings, bringing new competition, but it's more likely to be the company's watershed moment. Daily fantasy, in which contestants pick their line-ups of players based on their own information and intuition, is a lot more fun than vanilla sports gambling. If sports betting goes legit in any form, DraftKings enters that new market with a user base of gamers that are hooked on its product, plus the store of data and analytical smarts to set up a barrier against Las Vegas and any new entrant.
