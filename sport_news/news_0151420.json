Posted: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 11:15 pm Seminar on first aid and CPR for pet owners   \nWAMPUM -- CPR can save a pet's life. Tammy Schaas knows this. She's done it. \nSchaas recalls it as a scary incident. She was grooming Angel, an old, small mixed-breed dog, when the pet went limp on her grooming table. \n\"There wasn't time to think,\" she said. \"I cupped my hand over the dog's muzzle and blew into my hand and did the chest compressions, and the dog recovered. \n\"When it was all over and the dog was all right and went home, my nerves kicked in and I was shaking. I'm sorry it happened and I hope it doesn't happen to anyone else, but when it does, you may not have time to get to the vet. If there is something you can do, you will do it.\" \nSchaas is going to share the knowledge during a first aid and CPR seminar for pets Oct. 10. Schaas, owner of Sit N' Pretty School for Dogs in Volant, will host the session with Sacred Heart German Shepherds breeder Jodi Bobin. The cost is $50. \nSchaas learned CPR when she worked in Dr. Anthony DiBiagio's dental office in Ellwood City -- and never dreamed it would save a dog's life. \n\"After this happened to me, I knew others could benefit from it. We all love our pets so much,\" she said. \nAt the seminar, pet owners will learn how to respond promptly and calmly to basic health emergencies and provide basic first aid and CPR -- cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the technique's full name -- to their cats or dogs. \nThomas Wharry of New Castle, an EMS-certified first aid and CPR instructor, will teach the seminar. \nSchaas, who has been training dogs since 2002 and been in business since 2007, puts on two pet seminars every spring and two every fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:04:16.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
