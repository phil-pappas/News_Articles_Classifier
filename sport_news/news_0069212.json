One of the key plays on the drive came when Tanner Mangum found Terenn Houk for a 34-yard gain on second-and-8.\nThe Huskies answered when Bryant Shirreffs found Arkeel Newsome for a 30-yard touchdown pass to tie the game. The biggest play on the possession came when Shirreffs found Max DeLorenzo for an 8-yard pickup on third-and-3. A roughing-the-passer and targeting call that led to the ejection of Sione Takitaki gave the Huskies 15 more yards on the same play.\nConnecticut took its first lead of the night midway through the third quarter when Bobby Puyol connected on a field goal from 37 yards out. One of the most important plays came when Shirreffs found Noel Thomas for 4 yards on fourth-and-2 to keep the drive alive.\nBYU answered to even the score at 10 when Trevor Samson hit a 26-yard field goal. Although Mangum missed a would-be touchdown, he had two huge completions on the drive. The first came when he found Houk for a 24-yard reception on third-and-7. He converted on another third-and-long when he found Nick Kurtz for 25 yards.\nThe Cougars regained the lead on their next possession when Samson drilled a 25-yard field goal. One of the most significant plays came when Mangum found Mathews for a 4-yard reception to pick up a first down deep in Connecticut territory.\nBYU stretched the lead to 10 when Mathews made a leaping grab in the end zone for the 21-yard touchdown reception. That catch came on the first play after Bronson Kaufusi intercepted Shirreffs on a third-and-1 and returned it 13 yards to give BYU prime field position.\nThe Huskies cut the BYU lead to 20-13 when Puyol hit a field goal from 42 yards out. One of the important completions came when Shirreffs found Newsome for 12 yards on a third-and-6 in the Cougar half of the field.\nMathews scored his second touchdown of the night on a 6-yard reception to give the Cougars a 27-13 lead. There were three big plays that led to the BYU score, including a failed onside kick attempt that gave BYU a short field.\nFollowing an interception, Samson hit his third field goal of the night from 32 yards away for the final score of the night. The Cougars moved down the field thanks to runs of 11, 18 and 15 yards by Bernard.\nThree stars\n3. Terenn Houk\nHouk had by far his most productive receiving game during his time at BYU. He caught six passes for 129 yards, including receptions of 16, 34, 14, 28, 13 and 24 yards.\n2. Sae Tautu\nTautu had the best game so far in his BYU career. He made a huge impact on the defense with six solo tackles, three tackles for loss and a sack.\n1. Mitch Mathews\nMathews had another big day in the receiving game for the Cougars. He caught eight passes for 78 yards, including touchdowns of 21 and 6 yards.\nAnalyzing the stats\nThe Cougars absolutely dominated the yards from scrimmage. They had a season-high 539 yards of offense while allowing a season-low 230 yards on defense.\nFour BYU receivers had at least five receptions and more than 50 yards receiving. That is the first time the Cougars have done that since Bronco Mendenhall has been the head coach.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928086", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928084", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928085", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928083", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928087", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-boxscores.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/results/2015-2016/boxscore48272.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928083", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928084", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928085", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928086", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638183%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443928087"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:10:40.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
