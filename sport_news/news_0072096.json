(AP Photo/Mike Groll, File) Browse for Republican American Reprints FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) -- It has been over a year since Stevan Ridley last cradled a football in a game. It's also the last time he openly wept on the sideline.On Oct. 12, 2014, the then-New England running back took a handoff from Tom Brady late in the third quarter at Buffalo, made an awkward step while trying to avoid a tackle and went down in a heap.He had two torn ligaments in his right knee, the same one he hurt in college. Ridley's season was over and his career in jeopardy. But after allowing his emotions to pour out, he never doubted he would someday be back on the field.\"My faith is in a God that can work miracles, some beautiful things,\" said Ridley, now a member of the New York Jets. \"I've seen way bigger issues come around than a knee injury. I've seen people be cured from cancer.\"So, for more than 12 months, Ridley has been working hard and praying for his comeback.He fully practiced for the first time Wednesday since the injury, and has a chance to make his season debut Sunday against the Patriots in New England.\"The story couldn't be written any better,\" Ridley said. \"I'm fired up about it. It's my distant family. I've got so many friends over there.\" More Stories About: NFL , Jets , Ridley \nFollow Us We encourage your feedback and dialog.
