Since fantasy teams are locked when the games begin, they said, Haskell wouldn't have been able to rig his lineup that day.\n\"Nothing is more important to DraftKings and FanDuel than the integrity of the games we offer to our customers,\" the release said. \"Employees with access to this data are vigorously monitored by internal fraud controls teams, and we have no evidence anyone misused it.\"\nRegardless of whether Haskell cheated or not, there's still an amount of good judgement, and luck, that needed to work in his favor.\nWith access to DraftKings data, Haskell saw the quantity of site users picking a select group of NFL players. It would make picking his lineup on FanDuel significantly easier, because the two sites have about the same \"price\" for a given player under an imaginary \"salary cap\" each week.\nThe challenge for Haskell, and the roughly two million daily fantasy users that use FanDuel and DraftKings, is balancing high-performing players with less expensive, high-potential players that won't be chosen by as many other users.\nIf Haskell saw that Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton was owned by a relatively small percent of users in Week 3, Haskell might have been motivated to use Dalton (which he did, and Dalton passed for 383 yards and three touchdowns). But just having site users' information wouldn't guarantee Haskell's success. His quarterback still had to play well, which isn't guaranteed.\nHaskell just may have won on judgement and good luck that weekend. But he has also had a wave of incredible recent success betting on baseball, according to a report from Larry Brown Sports .\nThe DraftKings employee scored three first-place finishes in the month of August on FanDuel's Major League Baseball daily fantasy games, the report showed, and had a total of eight top-10 finishes.\nHaskell took home a cash prize on 20 of the month's 31 days, the report said. On 10 of those days, Haskell earned money in at least two separate daily fantasy competitions, and on two August days, won cash in at least three games.\nOn Aug. 5, Haskell placed in the top-10 of three different contests offering a combined total of $260,000, and also finished in the top-100 of a $150,000 payout game.\nHaskell, who has played in daily fantasy games since 2013, has recorded 95 of his top 100 daily earnings since he started working for DraftKings in late 2014, the report said.\nContact Chris Kudialis at ckudialis@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4593.
