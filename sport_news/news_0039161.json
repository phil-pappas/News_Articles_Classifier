Then Latavius Murray took his eyes off the ball twice, trying to get a head start running, and the turnovers got him benched late. Derek Carr threw some pretty passes but the Bears double-teamed Amari Cooper often and the Raiders can’t take advantage and use their tight end like teams do against them. \nDefense \nThis tight end thing is no fluke. Four straight career-high performances against the Raiders, and they just don’t have the personnel to stop it. But that’s not why they lost. They held Matt Forte in check, but had to find a way to get more than three sacks against a makeshift offensive line and a quarterback with a bad hamstring. \nSpecial teams \nPunter Marquette King got the Raiders out of some bad situations, averaging 45 yards net on five punts. Iron man Sebastian Janikowski doesn’t miss. And Oakland didn’t give up any big plays in the return game. They never make any themselves, but overall solid effort. \nCoaching \nBill Musgrave couldn’t get the running game going, and didn’t have an answer when the Bears took Cooper out of the game. Also got conservative in the end, when a touchdown would have won the game instead of settling for a field goal. Defensively, the Raiders held tough after losing safety TJ Carrie. They were lucky Cutler didn’t throw to Bennett more often. \nOverall \nNobody had the Raiders going 3-1, but that doesn’t mean they should be left off the hook for squandering a chance to do so. They lost to an 0-3 team playing without its best receiver and two starting offensive linemen. \n— Vic Tafur", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:55:30.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
