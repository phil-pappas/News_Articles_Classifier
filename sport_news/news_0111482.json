It wasn’t always clean but they clawed on the road against a very tough Oral Roberts team.” \nAs a team the Coyotes recorded nine total team blocks, senior Kelsey Biltoft led the team with four block assists. Her career total is 307, which is good for second all-time on the Coyotes block assists list. \nThis is Jessen’s 10th double-double and third straight of the season. Jessen had 45 assists and 17 digs. \nSix Coyotes had at least five kills and Biltoft led the Coyotes with 13 and had an attack percentage of .591. Juniors Audrey Reeg and Lindsey Brown had 12 and 10 kills, respectively. \nFreshman Libero Lauren Mattison helped protect the backline with 13 digs and Reeg and senior Kaitlyn Hastings added 11 apiece. \nSet one was competitive and neither team led by more than three. With the Coyotes down 17-14, two kills by Reeg and one from junior Haley Jorgensen during a 5-2 run helped the Coyotes tie up the set at 19. With the score tied at 24, Biltoft had back-to-back kills as the Coyotes claimed set one. \nIn set two, the Coyotes were down 19-15. South Dakota went on a 10-4 run and scored three straight points twice, to complete the comeback and win the set. Reeg, Biltoft, Jessen, sophomore Kelly Law, and freshman Hayley Dotseth all recorded kills during the run as the Coyotes took a 2-0 lead in the match. \nOral Roberts won set three and South Dakota bounced back in set four. The Coyotes jumped out to a 10-5 lead and coasted until the Golden Eagles got within one. With the Coyotes up 19-18, Reeg and Biltoft had three kills apiece as South Dakota won set four and the match. \n“Our middles had a fantastic match,” said Williamson. “Kelsey and Lindsey scored the ball at a high rate which made us more difficult to defend. We need to continue to improve each day. We are playing some of our best volleyball which is what we want at this point in the season.” \nThe Coyotes are back in action next weekend as the team hosts Omaha on Friday at 7 p.m. and Denver on Saturday at 7 p.m. in the Coyotes Den. \n\nCourtesy: USD DISCLAIMER: The views of the author are not necessarily those of this station, its owners, officers, agents or employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:13:04.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
