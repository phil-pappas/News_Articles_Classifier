Alistair Love had a header cleared off the line for the home side, and the same player forced a superb save from Graeme Smith.There was little further sign of a breakthrough until a slack backpass by the visitors allowed Gemmell in to round Smith, and score.Kevin Dzierzawski had a late chance to draw the sides level, but Ross Stewart saved superbly as Peterhead's winless league run extended to seven matches.
