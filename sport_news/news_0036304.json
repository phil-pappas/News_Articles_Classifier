It brought to an end the career of one of the best football coaches in SEC history whose reach extends all the way to Austin. \nSpurrier put together a 228-89-2 record as a head coach at Duke, Florida, and South Carolina. He also spent a few years in the NFL as head coach of the Washington Redskins. The Head Ball Coach or Ol’ Ball Coach as he was affectionately known won a national championship at Florida and is the only coach in history to win a Heisman Trophy himself and coach a Heisman Trophy winner. \nSpurrier’s wit and his needling of his opponents was one of his trademarks. Among some of his more famous quotes: On Tennessee: “You can’t spell Citrus without U-T.” On Tennessee QB Peyton Manning: “I know why Peyton came back for his senior year. He wanted to be a three-time start of the Citrus Bowl.” On Florida State’s Foot Locker Scandal in the 1990’s – “You know what FSU stand for, don’t you? Free Shoes University.” On South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney’s speeding ticket: “I didn’t know Jadeveon’s car that could go that fast. He doesn’t have a pretty car like those FSU guys used to drive.” On a fire at the Auburn library that destroyed 20 books: “The real tragedy was that 15 hadn’t been colored yet.” On playing Georgia early in the season: “I don’t know. I sort of always liked playing them that second game because you could always count on them having two or three key players suspended.” On coaching so long: “Why are you still coaching? I forgot to get fired and I’m not going to cheat.” \nBut Spurrier’s influence goes far beyond just his famous wit. He revolutionized the passing game in the SEC with his Fun ‘N’ Gun offense at the University of Florida and two of his former assistant coaches now lead two of the Big XII’s most historic programs. \nCurrent Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops served as an assistant head coach and defensive coordinator for Florida from 1996-1998. He coordinated the Gators’ national championship defense during the 1996 season that culminated with a Sugar Bowl win over Florida State. \nStoops left Spurrier at Florida to take over at Oklahoma as the Sooners head coach. Stoops led Oklahoma to the national championship in his second season in Oklahoma and continues to coach there. \nStoops congratulated Spurrier on his retirement through Twitter writing: 31years as the HBC - an icon, a HOF career, & great mentor-one of the best ever to coach! Congrats @SC_HBC on your retirement! #Winner — Bob Stoops (@OU_CoachStoops) October 13, 2015 \nBesides Stoops, University of Texas head coach Charlie Strong also spent time under the Ol’ Ball Coach. Strong coached with Spurrier in the early 1990’s before heading to Notre Dame and then returning to the Gators after Spurrier left. Strong went on to coach at Louisville before coming to Texas. \nWhile Strong hasn’t seen the same success as Stoops at Texas, he does own the latest bragging rights between the two former Spurrier coaches after last weekend’s upset by Texas over Oklahoma in the annual Red River Rivalry.
