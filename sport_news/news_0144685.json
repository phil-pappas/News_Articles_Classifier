But when (opponents) run to the outside, we stand up and the physicality doesn't matter.'' \nEarly in the first quarter, the Cedars (0-2 Section Two, 1-4 overall) matched scores with the Barons (2-0 Section Two, 4-1 overall). \nCentral, which scored TDs on its first eight drives (the ninth was stopped by halftime), went 63 yards in 12 plays to open the game, culminating in Nelson's first TD.

On a third-and-10 from their own 32, Lebanon quarterback Cody Kissinger, in the clutches of would-be tacklers, got a pass to Jeremiah Beckley and the catch and run was good for a 68-yard touchdown pass. \nA 38-yard kickoff return by Camacho set the Barons up at the Cedars' 41 and Camacho covered all 41 yards on the drive, going in from the 4. \nBut again, the Cedars had an answer. This time it was Malik Hunter who found clear sailing around the right end for 78 yards and a TD. \nAfter missing the point-after on its first TD, Lebanon went for two and was successful, Kissinger hitting Jan Suarez-Torres for two points, tying the game at 14-14. \nFrom there, the game turned one-sided, as the Barons took advantage three straight Lebanon turnovers, cashing in all three. \nSuarez-Torres' dropped a backwards pass that Central's Gavin Guyer scooped up and returned 25 yards to set up a Nelson TD run. \nThen Central's Harrison Myer picked off a Kissinger pass and in three plays Camacho was in to make it 35-14. \nGuyer intercepted Kissinger (8-18-2, 127 yards) for his second takeaway of the game and Nelson had to go only four yards for another Central TD. \n\"At the beginning of the year, everyone talked about Damon and he's been great for us,'' Hahn said. \"But now we have that 1-2 punch of Damon and Dylan and they are great workers and good athletes.'' \nCamacho and Nelson each added TD runs before the end of the first half. \n\"Our o-line just really let loose on them,'' Nelson said. \"There were holes all over. The o-line opened them up wherever we had to go.'' \nNelson and Camacho were beneficiaries of strong line play by the Barons, whose front five starters were composed of tackles Vanden Grube and DaShaun Neville, guards Elliot Martin and Garret Fittery and center Adam Kline. \n\"We wanted to approach the game at 100 percent and not take Lebanon lightly,'' Grube said. \"We wanted to pound them and I'm pretty sure we did.'' \nDaniel Caricabeur replaced Kissinger at quarterback for the Cedars after halftime. Kissinger suffered injuries to his throwing hand and was removed from the game as a precaution.
