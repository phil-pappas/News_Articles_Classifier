Tiana Fough A 27-year-year-old Oregon woman is making national headlines after she was removed from an American Airlines' Phoenix-to-Portland flight Sunday, seemingly with little explanation from airline employees.\nAccording to KATU News, Tiana Fough, a mother of two, was boarding American Flight 408 with other passengers when a flight attendant began yelling at her.\n\"I think this is my first time I've ever flown American,\" Fough told The Washington Post.\nAs she waited in the aisle to get to her seat, Fough chatted casually with another passenger in front of her, she told the Post. Then a flight attendant started yelling.\n\"Stay right there. I asked you three times,\" he shouted, in Fough's account of the incident.\nFough told KATU she didn't realize the flight attendant had been asking her to step to the side.\n\"He did not have my eye contact. He didn't have my attention. I didn't even hear him until he started yelling at me,\" Fough told KATU.\nFough said the attendant threatened to kick her off the plane. She eventually made it to a window seat on the right side of the airplane when a male flight attendant opened the overhead compartment near her seat.\n\"'Where's your stuff? You're getting off this plane right now,'\" Fough told KATU the airline employee said.\nIn a cell phone video shot by Bill Byrne, who was seated nearby, passengers can be heard questioning the decision. The recording also shows a crying Fough asking for a reason why she is being kicked off the flight.\nAs she's led away, passengers boo loudly, some promising never to fly American Airlines again.\nAn American Airlines spokesperson wrote in an e-mail statement to The Washington Post early Thursday that the incident has been taken care of.\n\"We are in contact with the passenger and have apologized,\" the statement reads. \"We have addressed the issue with our team members to ensure we provide a consistent, quality travel experience for our customers in the future.\"\nFough told the Post that an airline employee offered her a $250 voucher. When Fough declined, she was offered $250 in cash.\nShe is seeking legal help, she told the newspaper.\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-oNqumUQTE", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/15/shame-on-american-airline-booed-after-woman-is-thrown-off-a-flight/", "https://twitter.com/ORweather", "http://www.katu.com/news/local/passengers-boo-flight-crew-after-woman-kicked-off-flight--332264272.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:19:58.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
