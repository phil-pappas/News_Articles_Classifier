Elsewhere, Baltimore's Steve Smith (back), Buffalo's LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and Detroit's Eric Ebron (knee) were all ruled out while Alshon Jeffrey (hamstring) is questionable for Chicago.\nMORE: Best photos from Week 5 | NFL Week 5 picks\nHere are the five most impactful injuries heading into Week 5:\nSammy Watkins\n© AP Photo/Lynne Sladky Buffalo Bills wide receiver Sammy Watkins (14) warms up before an NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins, Sunday, Sept. 27, 2015 in Miami Gardens, Fla. The second-year Bills wide receiver appears to have bounced back from a calf injury that kept him out of last week's loss to the Giants and could make his return Sunday against the Titans. He was listed as questionable.\nAfter the calf injury kept him sidelined again Wednesday at practice, Watkins returned to the field Thursday to take part in individual drills. He made it clear earlier this week that he would test the injury before his playing status was ultimately decided, though his participation in drills was a positive sign he could be good to go.\nCoach Rex Ryan said Thursday that Watkins is close to returning, but his availability for Sunday in Tennessee is \"a reach.\" If he does prove to be ready, the Bills will gladly welcome back a key component to the team's offense that will be ready to attack a susceptible Titans defense, especially with running backs Karlos Williams (concussion) and LeSean McCoy (hamstring) ruled out .\nDeSean Jackson\n© AP Photo/Mark Tenally Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson (11) waits to be introduced before an NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins, Sunday, Sept. 13, 2015, in Landover, Md. The Redskins receiver returned to the practice field this week and said his comeback against the Falcons on Sunday is \"possible\" if he continues to improve.\nJackson has been sidelined since Week 1 after suffering a hamstring injury while attempting to catch a deep pass against the Dolphins. He attributed the injury to missing preseason with a sprained AC joint in his shoulder. It was initially reported in Week 1 that Jackson would miss about three to four weeks, so he's past due to make his return.\nWashington could certainly use a boost from its No. 1 wideout as the team visits Atlanta with the hope of handing the undefeated Falcons their first loss of the season. The Redskins could also receive a key reinforcement from cornerback DeAngelo Hall, who sustained a Grade 2 tear in a toe on his right foot Week 3 against the Giants.\nAlshon Jeffery\n© AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh Chicago Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery walks around the sideline during the first half of an NFL football game against the Oakland Raiders, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015, in Chicago. After a limited performance in practice this week, the Bears wideout will look to add some dimension to Chicago's struggling passing game Sunday in Kansas City.\nJeffery hasn't played since his underwhelming five-catch effort in the season opener at Green Bay, where he injured his hamstring. He also suffered a calf injury Aug. 12 that kept him out for the entire preseason.\nIf Jeffery is ready to make his highly anticipated return this week, he'll complement quarterback Jay Cutler nicely against a Chiefs secondary that has surrendered an NFL-worst 10 touchdown receptions to opposing wideouts this season.\nEddie Royal, who figures to see the most targets if Jeffery can't play, also is questionable to play Sunday.\nJeremy Hill\n© Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports Cincinnati Bengals running back Jeremy Hill (32) scores a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs at Paul Brown Stadium. The Bengals won 36-21. With the Seahawks rolling into Cincinnati, the Bengals will need their top running back at his best to maintain their undefeated record.\nHill was limited in practice this week because of a knee injury but there has been no indication he is in danger of being ruled out this week. Although he had only had nine carries last Sunday against the Chiefs, he scored three touchdowns and successfully completed a two-point conversion.\nIf Hill isn't 100 percent, the Bengals will rely on Giovani Bernard to carry the bulk of the workload in the backfield. Seattle hasn't allowed a running back to score this season, but Cincinnati could be up for the challenge if all backs are on deck to balance the Bengals' potent passing game.\nJulius Thomas\n© AP Photo/John Raou Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas (80) catches a pass before an NFL preseason football game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Pittsburgh Steelers, Friday, Aug. 14, 2015, in Jacksonville, Fla. The Jaguars tight end participated in limited practice sessions this week but isn't optimistic he will be ready to play Sunday against the Buccaneers.\nThomas caught passes for the first time since injuring his hand Aug. 14 and undergoing surgery Sept. 1 , though he has not yet been fully cleared to play. The former Bronco, who signed a five-year, $46 million deal to make him the NFL’s highest-paid tight end, originally suffered the injury in Jacksonville's first preseason game and hasn't gone through a full workout at practice since. He did, however, participate in two weeks of side-field work and one week of practice in which he ran routes in team drills.\nDespite making strides toward his return, Thomas will likely sit out this Sunday and make his debut at home against Houston next week, which could prove effective against a disappointing Texans defense.\nOmnisport's Jordan Heck contributed to this report.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://blogs.buffalobills.com/2015/10/08/clay-added-to-injury-report/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-09/marshawn-lynch-injury-thomas-rawls-fred-jackson-seahawks-fantasy", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-08-15/julius-thomas-injury-update-jaguars-broken-finger-miss-rest-of-preseason-tight-end-fantasy-football", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657643-nfl-week-5-photos-pictures-colts-texans-arian-foster-adam-vinatiera-mike-adams-football", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-08/nfl-picks-week-5-predictions-odds-lines-patriots-cowboys-bengals-seahawks-saints-eagles", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-08-31/julius-thomas-surgery-finger-injury-update-jaguars-fantasy-tight-end-return"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:45:20.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
