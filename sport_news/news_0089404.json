Novak Djokovic of Serbia kisses his champion trophy during the awarding ceremony for the men's singles final at 2015 China Open Tennis Tournament in Beijing, China, Oct. 11, 2015. Djokovic claimed the title of the event after beating Rafael Nadal of Spain 2-0. (Xinhua/Li Wen) \nThis is the 45th meeting between the two players -- Nadal winning 23 of those, but on this day it would be Djoker that would be the more consistent player. On this rally the Spaniard tries to change tactics with a drop shot, but the Serb is too quick for that -- and gets to it and angles a volley for a winner. \nFacing a break point, Rafa looks to have the World Number One on his heels, but is unable to put away this easy volley at the net and falls behind 5-2 in the opener. \nAnd Djoker takes the next game at love with a massive forehand to clinch the frame 6-2. \nAnd Novak is ruthless in the second set, already up 4-1 he is able to hit this forehand cross court for a winner, and puts himself one game away from another title in the Chinese capital. \nAnd the defending champion wins it in style with an ace on match point, to seal a 6-2, 6-2 victory over his old rival. \nThe top-ranked Serbian improves his record in Beijing to 29-and-oh, and has only lost three sets here in six years.
