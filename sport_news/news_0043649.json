Something kind of big happened there Tuesday. \nRyan Field. Will something big happen there Saturday? Compared to the Cubs finishing off the Cardinals in the National League playoffs? Uh, no. \nOn with the Fun Facts: \n1. Iowa hasn’t won at Northwestern since 2007. But that covers just two losses. \n2. This is the first time Iowa has been in a meeting of ranked teams since 2010. Iowa hasn’t beaten a ranked team on the road since, well, since it’s last road game, at Wisconsin. \n3. The only two times Iowa started a Big Ten season 3-0 under Kirk Ferentz were 2002 and 2009. The Hawkeyes finished those seasons in the Orange Bowl. If they reach the Orange Bowl this season, it means they’ve gone 13-0 since that is one of the two College Football Playoff semifinal games. \n4. Northwestern and Iowa are tied for seventh in the nation in red zone defense. Both have allowed nine scores in their opponents’ 13 trips to the red zone. \n5. Three different Iowa receivers (Tevaun Smith, Matt VanDeberg, Jerminic Smith) have had 100-yard receiving games. No other Big Ten team can say that. \n6. The nation’s leading receiving Smith is Southern California’s Juju Smith-Schuster , who has 619 receiving yards and six touchdowns. \n7. Northwestern has been outscored 34-16 in first-quarters, but has outscored its foes 111-39 from the second quarter forward. \n8. Iowa has 11 plays of 40-plus yards in six games. Last season, it had just 12 such plays in 13 games. \n9. Northwestern has players from 20 different states. None are from Iowa. \n10. Until this week, November 1941 was the last time Duke, Stanford, Notre Dame and Northwestern were all ranked at the same time. The Wildcats beat Stanford and Duke in September, and defeated Notre Dame last November. \n11. Northwestern played before more fans (110,452) at Michigan last Saturday than attended the Wildcats’ previous three home games combined. Northwestern’s average home crowd this year is 31,326. \n12. Late-night talk show hosts Stephen Colbert (Class of ‘86) and Seth Meyers (Class of ‘96) are Northwestern graduates . \n13. Ryan Field isn’t just the name of Northwestern’s stadium. It’s a Fox Sports sportscaster . \n14. The oldest child of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian is named North West. Kanye sat next to Northwestern President Morton Schapiro at a Chicago Bulls game last season. Northwestern students wrote Schapiro, telling him North West has to come to Northwestern someday, and ... ““I told him that, and he said, ‘I would love that!’” Schapiro said.
