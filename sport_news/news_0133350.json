On Friday, photos emerged of “61-58” painted in Baylor green on a wall on the TCU campus in Fort Worth. \n\nIn a joint statement, Baylor athletic director Ian McCaw and TCU athletic director Chris Del Conte condemned the acts of vandalism. McCaw said “it is most disappointing that the actions of a few cast a negative light on a rivalry that dates back more than a century.” Del Conte says TCU officials “are working closely with Baylor and public safety officials at both universities on their investigations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:41:23.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
