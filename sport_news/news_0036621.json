LOUIS — St. Louis residents still may get to vote on city funding for a new riverfront football stadium if some on the city's governing board get their way. \nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch ( http://bit.ly/1jD4Txj ) reports several members of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen on Friday are to introduce a measure that require a public vote before allowing the city to spend roughly $150 million on the billion-dollar stadium. \nMayor Francis Slay's office cautions such a bill could kill plans for the new stadium. \nThe move comes two months after a St. Louis judge declared as invalid an existing city ordinance requiring a public vote. \nIt's still unclear if St. Louis will have an NFL team when the stadium is finished. Rams owner Stan Kroenke is seeking to move to Los Angeles. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:04:08.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
