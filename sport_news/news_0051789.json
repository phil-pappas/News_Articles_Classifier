Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said they had arrested a person, identified as Rajwinder Singh, alias Raj Kanjla, under the Arms Act in the case as he had sold the pistol along with cartridges, used in the crime, for Rs 60,000. “Raj is a resident of Kanjla village, Sangrur. He is already facing at least four criminal cases, including attempt to murder. He had spent 16 months in Sangrur Jail and four months in Nabha Jail. He had come out of the jail on bail around six months ago,” said the SSP. The SSP said the accused, Munish Prabhakar, an NRI, had asked Harpreet Singh to arrange a pistol for him as he wanted to settle a score with Yadwinder Singh, alias Yaddi, a resident of Barnala. “Yaddi had smashed Prabahkar’s gym at Barnala a few years ago. Prabhakar wanted to teach Yaddi a lesson and he especially had come here from the US for this purpose,” said inspector Gurcharan Singh, in charge of the CIA cell, which has arrested Kanjla. Prabhakar, who was high on drugs, had shot his childhood friend Harpreet Singh dead following a minor tiff on October 10 near Kumbhra Chowk at Sector 69.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:01:49.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
