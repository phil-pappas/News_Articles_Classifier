Moore Jr. also ordered Birge, 61, to serve three years supervised release after completion of her custody term but imposed no fine citing her inability to pay.\nThere is no parole in a federal sentence.\nShe will have until 2 p.m. on Nov. 20 to report to a federal facility designated for custody.\nBirge, standing with attorney Tom Withers, told Moore that she “wanted to ask forgiveness for everybody who has been affected by my wrongdoing.\n“I am ashamed and embarrassed.”\nBut she asked Moore to consider her efforts to beat the twin problems of pain medication and gambling addiction and said, “I never meant to hurt anyone.”\n“I promise to you that I will never let anyone down again,” Birge said.\n“This is atrocious,” Clarence Bynes Jr., who was one of Birge’s 33 individual victims, told Moore. “There was no fear here. … This was just greed. Why would anyone do this to young kids. … Ms. Birge should be ashamed.”\nHe told the judge he lost $217,000 with Probate Court from the sale of his father’s house. He did not learn of the theft until the day he went to claim the money and was told his money was gone.\n“I’m sorry. I don’t see no leniency. … Your honor, this is not fair,” Bynes said.\nHis testimony, one of three victims to address the court, came after Birge’s sister-in-law, Karen Birge Lang, testified the family could not believe her conduct.\n“Everyone depended on her,” Lang said. “Obviously she’s been under a lot of stress for a number of years.”\nBirge’s father, Robert Helmey, also testified he did not know what had occurred.\n“I don’t know. It’s not Kim,” he said. “I ask for a second chance in life for her.”\nBirge pleaded guilty on July 31 to stealing $232,000 from the court as part of a scheme in which the government said she stole more than $750,000 over a three-year period.\nAs part of the plea to the mail fraud count, prosecutors dismissed the remaining counts in the indictment.\nA pre-sentencing investigation identified 33 individual victims, two estates and Chatham County Probate Court that suffered loses as the result of her conduct.\nMoore said the 36 victims suffered actual loses, adding that none of the funds ever belonged to the court.\nThe issue then was “who paid what money to whom,” Moore said.\nHe set the actual restitution in the case at $751,715.95.\n‘Life spiraled out of control’\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Scarlett Nokes told Moore that despite Birge’s battles with both drugs since 2008 and gambling excesses since 2003, she did not seek help until her crimes were discovered.\nThe case was in court because Birge victimized people who were trusting her to do her job, Nokes said.\nBut, Nokes said, the government was standing by its agreement in the negotiated plea to recommend that she be sentenced at the low end of the sentencing guidelines of 63 months.\nThe recommended sentencing guidelines were 63-78 months, with the final sentence Moore’s alone.\nUnder the terms of her negotiated plea with the government, Birge pleaded guilty to count three of a five-count indictment, charging her with mail fraud and federal program fraud in the scheme the government said lasted between January 2011 and November 2011.\nBut under federal sentencing guidelines, probation officers can consider all alleged misconduct — including dismissed counts — in reaching their recommendations to the judge.\nDuring Birge’s appearance in court, the judge said he found it a mystery that the 342 checks she had written to cash, 322 were checks for less than $3,000 and only 20 in excess of that number.\nBirge explained that Probate Judge Harris Lewis had told her she did not have to get permission to write checks of $2,900 or less.\nWhen Moore suggested that her conduct suggested she had a reason for the check sums, Birge responded, “I didn’t try to hide anything from anyone. … Much of the time I didn’t know what I was doing.\n“I can’t explain why I did what I did and I’m sorry and I just pray for mercy.”\nAnd Birge said that despite the probation report finding only an audit of the court in 2009. “That’s not true. We were audited every year. Every year they come in my office and sat in the record room and audited our records,” Birge said.\nProbation officials only found a 2009 audit and one in 2014.\nThe count to which she pleaded charged that between Sept. 21, 2011, and Oct. 18, 2011, a check for $232,000 payable to the Chatham County Probate Court was among those she used for herself.\nIn his pre-sentencing memorandum, Withers told Moore his client’s life spun out of control because of painkiller drugs and gambling, leaving her “shamed and a lifetime of good works destroyed.”\n“Kim was unable to handle the losses and stressors in her life and instead of seeking help, she turned to drugs and gambling,” Withers said. “She would disappear into a world of addiction, and her life spiraled out of control.\n“Ultimately, Kim became addicted to the prescription opioids she was taking for pain management. Kim became seriously addicted to video game gambling in convenience stores both near her work and home.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14835139.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14835139.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:13:29.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
