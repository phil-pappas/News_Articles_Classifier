While the colors are bursting, the two have teamed up to sell the season, harvesting the fall foliage by hand from around the Green Mountains and selling it.\n“To have something like this in your hands is amazing,” said Davis, who calls this area’s leaf bounty “the world’s best foliage.”\nThe leaves are put in a plastic bag and vacuum-sealed. If you leave them in the bag, Vermont Leaf Company says the color will last for days. Or, you can open it, Heiss said.\n“We expect people to open the package and take them out and smell the leaves and get a sense for what it’s like to be in Vermont and to see and smell and touch it,” Heiss said.\nDavis added, “I think it’s a chuckle and a wonderful thing - really, it’s a complete delight.”\nFor a sense of Vermont’s foliage, you can order an assortment of 12 leaves for $20 a box, or 50 leaves for $40. Shipping is free.\nThe company just started this month and has already received orders from the west coast. The idea came to Davis when he was pondering everything Vermont was known for - maple syrup, craft brews, cheese,,,\n“We’re also famous for foliage, and no one else is shipping Vermont leaves?” Davis said. “I had to jump on that. I had to embrace that.”\nWith low overhead costs, since the inventory is free, the two said it was a no-brainer business to begin - sharing pieces of Vermont with the entire world.\nCopyright 2015 WCAX via CNN.
