Currently, students must spend their own money to purchase a ring.\n\"State championships are rare, and in many cases in small communities, there are a lot of kids that come through that don't have the money [to buy a ring],\" Breithaupt said. \"And those schools have benefited from a state championship, sometimes financially. So why shouldn't the school - if they wanted to with their own money - provide a ring for them? I think it's a noble cause and a way for schools to celebrate a championship.\n\"You shouldn't be having to do a bake sale after winning a state championship [to get a ring].\"\nIn general, the new re-writing of the UIL constitution has liberalized many of the state's amateur athlete rules. Among the items passed by the Legislative Council on Monday were provisions removing restrictions on providing parents with free tickets or passes, increasing the amount a school can spend on a letterman's patch, and allowing student-athletes to receive \"reasonable fees\" for coaching and officiating.\n\"The way that we move forward in 2015 is with less restrictions on things that don't really matter,\" Breithaupt said. \"I think people get that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:29:34.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
