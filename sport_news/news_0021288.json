(AP) - A Tupelo woman is facing multiple felony charges after police say she kidnapped two children from the Gulf Coast.\nMultiple media outlets report that 29-year-old Georgia Sasso, a social worker for the Mississippi State Department of Health, was arrested Wednesday and charged with two counts of kidnapping and two counts of sexual battery. Police say Sasso drove to south Mississippi the weekend before her arrest, picked up two juveniles and brought them back to Tupelo.\nTupelo Police Detective Lynette Sandlin says the juveniles were listed as runaways on the Gulf Coast, so police did a welfare check. Investigators said there had been sexual misconduct between her and the juveniles.\nSandlin says Sasso wasn't related to the victims, but knew one of them through her job. It's unclear whether Sasso has an attorney.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
