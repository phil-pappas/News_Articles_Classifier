Aller/Getty Images (PITTSBURGH) -- The Chicago Cubs followed the lead of their ace Jake Arrieta Wednesday night, eliminating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Wild Card Game.A pair of home runs from Dexter Fowler and rookie Kyle Schwarber gave the Cubs a 4-0 lead early on, giving Arrieta more run support than he would need. The Cubs righty pitched a complete game shutout, striking out 11 Pirates. He allowed just four hits.The game may have given Pirates fans a feeling of deja vu, considering they were eliminated in the same game last year by the San Francisco Giants. In that loss, opposing pitcher Madison Bumgarner also went all nine innings, allowing just four hits and one walk, while striking out 10.Arrieta actually hit two Pirates batters, prompting what the Cubs saw as retaliation in the seventh inning. Pirates relief pitcher Tony Watson hit Arrieta in the side, bringing both teams' benches onto the field. Pirates infield Sean Rodriguez was among the more animated combatants, and after the teams returned to the dugout, Rodriguez was seen pummeling a gatorade cooler.In the wake of the incident, a parody Twitter account was born.The Cubs will go on to face their longtime rival St. Louis Cardinals in one of the National League Division Series matchups, beginning on Friday. \nCopyright   Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 11:09PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:33:42.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
