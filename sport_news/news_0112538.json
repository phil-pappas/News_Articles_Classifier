New England beat NYC FC 3-1. \nWith Le Toux improving to 13 for 13 on penalty kicks, the Union (10-17-7) snapped a two-game losing streak, but missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. Quick Clicks \nCristian Higuita collected a pair of second-half yellow cards and was ejected in the 86th minute. \nThe teams were booked for 10 cards in the game, seven by Orlando City. \nBlake, the first pick in the 2014 SuperDraft, needed five saves to collect the shutout. \nOrlando City’s five-game winning streak leading up to Sunday's contest propelled the team to having the best campaign for an expansion team since 2009, finishing ahead of five other clubs and tying the highest win mark for an expansion team since 1998 with 12, according to team officials. \n\"I thought we started the game slow and after having a word at halftime, I thought we showed a bit more in the second half,\" head coach Adrian Heath said. \"We played a bit more like we have been of late, showed a lot more determination, enthusiasm and desire. But, I'm disappointed we've finished the way that we have. We're better than the performance we put out this evening. But, we've had a great last month to the season. There's been some really pleasing stuff and also some things we have to get better at. That's what the offseason is for -- to try and improve and make sure we're above the red line next year.\" \nOrlando City’s average of 32,847 fans per home game, the highest for an expansion team in league history, drew over a half million fans to the Orlando Citrus Bowl throughout the year, making Orlando City the fastest team in MLS history to reach that mark, according to the team. \n\"I can't applaude and thank our fans enough. They've been incredible,\" Heath said. \"There were about 80-plus waiting for us at our hotel last night. And, as I told the players, that's who you play for -- the people who spend hard-earned money to watch you play football.\" \nFor more information on the 2017 season ticket waitlist, click here or call 855-ORL-CITY. \nCopyright 2015 by ClickOrlando.com.
