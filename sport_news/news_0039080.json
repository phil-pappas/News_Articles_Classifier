Any time the Sonora Wildcats and the Summerville Bears play each other, team records are meaningless. Stats are meaningless. Individual achievements are meaningless. The only thing that matters is the score after 80 minutes. With that, the Bears could smile following the final whistle Tuesday night, shutting out their cross county rivals 3-0 at Dunlavy Field. The ‘Cats pressured Summerville early in the game. In the game’s first 10 minutes, Clayton Roberson twice had a one-on-one shot at the goal. And each time, Summerville goalkeeper Kevin Lund made a clutch save. The early Sonora intensity was not something that caught the Bears off guard.“Sonora is a great team when it comes to the intensity,” Braden Anderson said. “Every game, they come out on fire. When that happens, we just need to calm down, go back to our roots, and just play soccer.” Though the shots were not falling, Sonora appeared to have the early momentum, but could still not fully capitalize on the Bears miscues. “When you can’t score in this game, it takes a toll on you,” said Sonora head coach Lloyd Longeway. “When you get opportunities and you don’t get it, it mentally puts a block on you. A team like Summerville isn’t going to give up opportunity after opportunity.” Anderson, who missed the last few games with an ankle injury, made his return the pitch a memorable one, scoring the first goal of the evening midway through the first half. Ben Richards had the ball on the goal line and made a perfect pass to Anderson for the shot. Though he hadn’t played in nearly two weeks, Anderson looked as strong and as dominating as he was before his injury.“At first, the nerves were going, but I know I’m surrounded by amazing teammates and they made my job really easy tonight,” Anderson said. Having Anderson back on the field was a welcomed sight for Summerville head coach Dave Reel.“There is always that apprehension throwing him out too early,” Reel said. “It’s huge having him back. It’s the calmness that he brings. He’s our security blanket.” Neither team could score the remainder of the half, and Summerville held on to a 1-0 lead. The Bears shutout their last two opponents, and were one half away from making it three in a row. Even though teams have not been scoring against Summerville, that was not something that Longeway cared about.“I wasn’t worried about that at all,” Longeway said. “Summerville has a decent team, but I wasn’t scared of them. We respect them but we could have scored on them. We had opportunities tonight. We’ve always had good luck scoring against Summerville. They are in a good run of players right now, but we weren’t really worried about that.” The ‘Cats continued to pressure the Bears in the beginning of the second half. Sonora had, what appeared to be a near-perfect play when Ross Irwin made a soaring pass from 45-yards out to Roberson. With the ball coming down near the Summerville goal, Roberson jumped and headed the ball. The trajectory of his header was a foot too high and sailed over the goal and the Bears still led 1-0. Summerville got its second goal of the night with 18:06 remaining on a Ben Richardson penalty kick. Senior Trey PetersonWood scored the Bears final goal of the night on a breakaway with 3:53 remaining. PetersonWood is finally becoming healthy with the playoffs just around the corner.“This is a healthy Trey,” Reel said. “Before our first preseason game he got hurt. He worked his way back, and then he injures himself just a little bit. What you are seeing is Trey becoming more comfortable with his injury and working through it.” Summerville held on and got its third shutout in as many games. Even coming up short, Longeway was pleased with the way his team battled with the defending Mother Lode League champions.“I thought our guys played right with them,” Longeway said. “I thought we played really hard in both halfs and I’m very proud of them.” The Bears will face Amador on Thursday in Sutter Creek, while Sonora plays in Linden.
