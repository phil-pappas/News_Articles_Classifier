The strike was over the reduction in price for cleaning paddy. The Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB) has reduced the price from Rs 5 per bag to Rs 3.40. When labourers were protesting against the HSAMB’s decision, they learnt some farmers were cleaning paddy themselves with fans. Subsequently, they attacked farmers, injuring three of them. Gopal, Surajmal and Ramphal — all from Gangaur village in Uttar Pradesh — were hurt. When other farmers learnt about the attack, they and commission agents attacked the labourers. They kept on fighting in the presence of the police. The police had a tough time in controlling the situation. The police have rounded up four labourers, including their leader Jang Bhadur. Station House Officer (SHO) Mohan Lal said the police were investigating the matter. A case has not been registered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:07:22.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
