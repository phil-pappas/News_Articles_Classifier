(AP) - Sacha Kljestan and Lloyd Sam scored to help the New York Red Bulls beat the Montreal Impact 2-1 on Wednesday night. \nNew York (16-9-6) will secure the Eastern Conference regular-season title with a win or tie in either of its two remaining matches. The Red Bulls are three points ahead of Los Angeles and FC Dallas in the race for the overall lead. \nAmbroise Oyongo was shown a red card for a hand ball on what otherwise would certainly have been a goal by Bradley Wright-Phillip in the 15th minute, leaving Montreal (12-13-6) a man down. \nKljestan put away the ensuing penalty kick. \nWright-Phillips slipped behind the defense on a breakaway, pulling goalkeeper Evan Bush out to the top of the box, but couldn’t convert either of two shots. The second, however, ricocheted back to Sam, who chipped over a scrambling Bush to make it 2-0 going into the half. \nDidier Drogba converted a penalty kick in the 67th for Montreal. \nFC DALLAS 0, WHITECAPS 0, TIE \nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - Vancouver tied FC Dallas to clinch a playoff spot for the second straight season. \nVancouver (15-12-5) is third in the Western Conference, a point behind FC Dallas (15-10-6) and the Los Angeles Galaxy. \nDallas had the best chance to win it, but substitute Blaz Perez’s shot in the 90th minute slipped just wide of goalkeeper David Ousted’s far post. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:09:41.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
