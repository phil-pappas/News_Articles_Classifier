BOSTON - Former Christ the King coach Bob Oliva is expected to plead guilty to sex abuse charges in a Massachusetts courtroom Monday - and some of the friends and family members of the alleged victim are not too happy about it.\nOliva, indicted last year on two counts of rape of a child, faced two life sentences if convicted, but the plea deal his attorney, Michael Doolin , negotiated with the Suffolk County (Mass.) District Attorney's office does not call for prison time.\nSome friends and family members of the alleged victim, Jimmy Carlino , say Oliva should spend at least a few months in a Massachusetts prison.\n\"I'm very disappointed,\" said Sam Albano , a sports TV producer and former Oliva friend who testified before the grand jury that indicted Oliva. \"This predator will keep his act on the streets where he will always be a threat to society.\"\nIn a letter to Suffolk Superior Court Judge Carol Ball, Albano urged Ball to reject the deal, saying Oliva has repeatedly claimed the sex abuse allegations were an attempt by Carlino and others to shake him down and ruin his reputation.\n\"Oliva is pleading guilty for the convenience of not being incarcerated and nothing more, particularly since he faces two life sentences for his predatory acts on the victim,\" Albano wrote.\nOther Carlino supporters say that although Oliva is avoiding a prison sentence, he is not getting off scot-free. The terms of the agreement between Doolin and prosecutor Leora Joseph have not been disclosed, but it is likely that Oliva will have to acknowledge in court that he sexually abused Carlino, then 14 years old, during a 1976 trip to Boston for a Yankees-Red Sox doubleheader. Oliva will also probably have to register as a sex offender, report to a probation officer, attend counseling, give up coaching youth sports and stay away from children in exchange for avoiding prison.\nDoolin and Jake Wark , a spokesman for the Suffolk County DA's office, declined to comment on the plea agreement.\nOliva, who won 549 games and four CHSAA Class AA intersectional titles during 27 seasons at Christ the King Regional High School, is one of the most important coaches in New York City basketball history. Scores of his players - including Lamar Odom and Jayson Williams - later played for top Division I and NBA teams.\nOliva resigned as the Royals' coach in January 2009, citing heart problems caused by the strain of sex abuse allegations first raised by Carlino during the spring of 2008. Carlino told the Daily News that he first met Oliva when he was a 7-year-old kid trying out for the youth basketball program at St. Teresa of Avila Roman Catholic Church in Queens. He said Oliva abused him for several years during the 1970s, beginning when Carlino was 11 years old.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:49:35.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
