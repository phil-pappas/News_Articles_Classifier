AP Edsall's out: Terps dismiss coach after disastrous start Coordinator Locksley named interim coach By Don Markus and Daniel Gallen Baltimore Sun Media Group (TNS) Oct 12, 2015 2 Associated Press \nRandy Edsall had a 22-34 record in four-plus seasons as Maryland’s head coach. The Terps had just one Top 25 victory under Edsall — a victory at Virginia Tech in 2013 — and many embarrassing losses. \nLess than four months after signing a contract extension through 2019, Maryland football coach Randy Edsall was fired Sunday, midway through a disastrous season. \nThe dismissal, a day after the Terps lost at No. 1 Ohio State, 49-28, the team’s third straight blowout defeat, ends Edsall’s five-year tenure in College Park with an overall record of 22-34. He is due to receive $2.6 million from Maryland — his base pay for 2016 plus the guaranteed portion of his extension. After next season, his buyout would have dropped to $500,000. He also receives what he’s owed for the rest of this season. \nEdsall was informed of the move by athletic director Kevin Anderson, who named offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Locksley as the team’s interim head coach. \n“We appreciate Randy’s tireless commitment to the University of Maryland,” Anderson said. “This was a difficult decision, but ultimately this is the best course of action for our football program moving forward.” \nAssistant head coach/outside linebackers coach Lyndon Johnson also was fired. \nMaryland (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten Conference) has a bye week before it plays Penn State at M&T Bank Stadium on Oct. 24. \nEdsall is the second straight Maryland football coach Anderson has fired; he also bought out the remaining year on Ralph Friedgen’s contract at the end of an 8-4 regular season in 2010. Friedgen, who went 75-50 over a decade in College Park and was named Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year in his final season, stepped down after a win in the Military Bowl. \nIn replacing Friedgen, Anderson said he wanted a coach to take the Maryland program from “good to great.” \nIn 12 years at Connecticut, Edsall had gone 74-70 overall, leading the Huskies into the Football Bowl Subdivision and eventually an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl after an 8-4 regular-season mark in 2010. \n“This man is a builder and a champion,” Anderson said at Edsall’s introductory news conference in 2011. \n“This is a dream job for me,” said Edsall, who grew up across the Maryland state line in Glen Rock, Pennsylvania, and had gone to Maryland games at Byrd Stadium as a kid. “It’s not every time in your life that you want to go and have an opportunity to do something that you’ve really wanted to do once you entered the career field that you chose.” \nHis time at Maryland started with a lot of promise. \nEdsall led the Terps, wearing the first iteration of Under Armour’s “Maryland Pride” uniforms before a prime-time audience, to a 32-24 victory over Miami. Less than two weeks later, Maryland pushed eventual Orange Bowl champion West Virginia to the brink in a six-point loss. \nBut things deteriorated quickly from there. The Terps lost eight straight games to finish 2-10 despite having reigning ACC Rookie of the Year Danny O’Brien at quarterback. In 2012, after O’Brien transferred and four quarterbacks, including C.J. Brown, suffered season-ending injuries, Maryland finished the year with six straight defeats and a 4-8 overall record. \nMaryland had just one Top 25 win under Edsall — a victory at Virginia Tech in 2013 — and many embarrassing losses, including a blown 41-14 lead at North Carolina State in his first year, a 63-0 loss at Florida State two years ago and a second-half collapse last season against Rutgers, whose offensive coordinator happened to be Friedgen. \nInjuries to key players didn’t help. Freshman linebacker Shawn Petty was forced under center after the spate of quarterback injuries in 2012, and the Terps lost star wide receiver Stefon Diggs midway through his sophomore and junior years. In 2013, he and fellow receiver Deon Long suffered broken legs in the same game. \nEdsall struggled to endear himself to Maryland fans, and even some players, after replacing the popular Friedgen. There were culture clashes that first season when Edsall instituted a new set of rules, including a ban on earrings and hats inside Gossett Football Team House. Twenty-four players left the program within a year, including O’Brien, who transferred to Wisconsin, and offensive lineman Max Garcia, who went to Florida and now plays for the Denver Broncos. \nYet despite the tumultuous start, the program at times appeared headed in the right direction on and off the field. \nThe Terps improved their academic performance and graduation rate under Edsall. With the help of Locksley, a former assistant coach during Friedgen’s early years who returned in 2012 after an unsuccessful head coaching stint at New Mexico, Maryland’s recruiting improved, highlighted by the commitment from Diggs, a five-star prospect from Good Counsel. \nLast season, the Terps finished 7-6 for the second straight year, including a respectable 4-4 record in their inaugural Big Ten season, with watershed road wins over Penn State and Michigan. \nDespite losing Diggs, Long, Brown and a host of defenders in the offseason, Edsall remained upbeat about the team’s ability to compete in a difficult Big Ten East Division. \nBut Perry Hills, Caleb Rowe and Oklahoma State transfer Daxx Garman have struggled to provide solid play at quarterback, a recurring problem under Edsall. The defense, meanwhile, has been overmatched against high-flying spread offenses. Bowling Green outscored Maryland 42-14 in the second half of the Terps’ 48-27 loss on Sept. 12. \nMaryland soon lost to West Virginia and Michigan by a combined 73-6 margin, and Ohio State delivered the latest defeat Saturday afternoon before a packed homecoming crowd at Ohio Stadium. \nIn the end, Edsall’s record at Maryland was not better than or even comparable to Friedgen’s. It was similar to those of Joe Krivak (20-34) and Mark Duffner (20-35), both of whom were fired after five seasons.
