The two attended Big Blue Madness together, along with Harry Giles, and this afternoon, Giles’ coach Steve Smith told Adam Zagoria that after speaking with Giles, he thinks Monk and Fox could end up at the same school: \n“Fox and Monk both went to Kansas with him and they were both at Kentucky with him, so he kind of told me where they’re leaning but I’m not saying ” Smith said. “I’m keeping my mouth shut.” \nAsked if Giles said he thinks both players will land at the same place, Smith said, “I think he feels like they might. Those guys all talk to each other. He talks to Jayson [Tatum] and he talks to those other guys on the visits and it sounded to me, Harry didn’t necessarily say it, but it sounded to me like they might be going together somewhere. But I don’t know if it’s a 100 percent a sure thing, but they visited some of the same schools obviously.” \n\nConsidering Fox is a heavy UK lean and the Cats reportedly lead for Monk now as well , that’s a pretty good sign. Two of the top five players in a loaded 2016 class? Yes please. \nTo listen to Smith’s full remarks, including his thoughts on Kentucky’s chances with Giles, head on over to ZagsBlog.com .

Both players are complete team players but in the last two minutes Cal could isolate either one and they would win a one on one with any opposing guard in college. Jordan October 21, 2015 at 6:25   \nBig fan of Malik Monk if we can land these guys we’re set once again. Linebeard October 21, 2015 at 7:27   \nAnd I think we need at least one athletic post player Priceless October 21, 2015 at 7:45   \nWaiting for the dumb Leuther comment about his sources. Hey Leuther….what does your sources…..e …..your own self say. 8 god October 21, 2015 at 7:46   \nRIP chances with Giles Gi doc October 21, 2015 at 8:12   \nI think right now that it is a Monk, and Giles, and fox package deal. We need to stop Giles from going to Duke for his last visit . The main reason he would go to Duke is because of his friendship for Jason Tatum. These three players have bonded and these guys are really high on Kentucky right now after midnight madness . Coach Cal has been on Giles since 2013, I am a Kentucky fan but Kentucky is a no-brainer for Harry Giles and most certainly would be groomed to be the number one pick and showcased accordingly. We would’ve had Andrew Wiggins but he forgot about the aspect that the more talented Kentucky team was going to win more than Kansas. He forgot about our motto to “succeed and proceed “. Hopefully, Giles realizes we are the one and done school that showcases players and we are about them . if any player can make small sacrifices to win, Kentucky is for you .
