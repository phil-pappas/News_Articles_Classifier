She squares up, puts her head down and charges toward the rim. It’s a clean finish almost every time. \nThis is a simple routine for Carleton, one that is almost second nature to her. But the scene tends to leave her older teammates in awe. \n“She’s had some takes to the hoop where I’m like, that is not a freshman take,” redshirt sophomore Jadda Buckley said. “That’s just a strong basketball play right there.” \nFennelly, Buckley and the rest of the ISU women’s basketball team believe Carleton will make strong basketball plays early and often this year. The versatile guard from Ontario, Canada, is expected to make an immediate impact. \n“Bridget’s very good,” Fennelly said Thursday at the team’s media day. “If we had a game tonight, she’d start. I think Bridget could be as good a player as we’ve had here in a long time.” \nFennelly has plenty of reason for what could be interpreted as a lofty — some might even argue unfair — expectations. He said Carleton’s very skilled, very tough-minded and has a lot of versatility for a player her size. During the team’s first two practices, Carleton played at four different positions. \n“We’ve actually played her at the four, and right now, she’d be the backup point guard,” Fennelly said. “She’s fit in really well here. She’s quiet. She doesn’t talk a lot. But I think our fans are going to enjoy watching her play.” \nFennelly also said 95 percent of the reason Carleton is in Ames is because of associate head coach Jodi Steyer. Steyer first saw Carleton play on film, and what immediately stood out was her size. It’s hard to miss someone who’s 6-foot-1, Steyer said. \nThe next thing Steyer took note of was her pure talent. Carleton dribbled to her left and passed with her left hand. Then she went right and did the same. She took long-range shots, and when the hole was there, she attacked the rim. \n“A lot of times, when you watch film, you have a great shooter, or you have somebody called a slasher,” Steyer said. “It’s rare that you find — and especially in kids that are her size — people who can do it all.” \nFennelly and Steyer both said her multifaceted skill set is a byproduct of simply playing a lot of ball. Carleton grew up in a basketball family. Her mom, Carrie, was a four-year starter and Division II All-American at Grand Valley State in Michigan, and doubled as her high-school basketball coach. \nEven more, Carleton’s ability led her to various Canadian national teams. Recently, she was a captain for the U19 women’s national team, and averaged 12.3 points in 27 international games. As a senior in high school, she was rated as the top Canadian prospect in 2015. \nPlaying international ball also gave Carleton the kind of toughness that most incoming freshmen don’t possess. Fennelly has coached international teams four different times, and knows how durable players need to be to excel in the international game. \n“Big 12 is like powder puff stuff comparatively,” he said. “It’s a brawl when you play international, and she’s played against that — and she’s been the best player on that team, which means you get mauled even more. \n“I think the travel and playing against great teams and the scouting reports — there’s another level, obviously. She’s not ready to get into the Big 12 hall of fame, but she’s not going to back down from anybody because she’s scared of the setting.” \nAnd that has made it easy to coach Carleton early on. Fennelly said she already has an intrinsic motivation that most of his other players don’t possess. She wants to make the Canadian Olympic team for the 2016 Olympics. \nThat’s part of why she came to play college ball in the United States. She said the NCAA is more competitive than the CIS, Canada’s equivalent, and that’s going to do wonders for her in the long run. \n“A lot of the girls on the national team do participate in the NCAA,” She said. “It’s not uncommon. The level of basketball is just that much better and I wanted to be the best player I could be. I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to do that.” \nFans first opportunity to see Carleton in action will be on Nov. 5, when ISU plays Midwestern State in an exhibition. The Cyclones’ first real game will eight days after, when they host Hampton. \nUntil then, Carleton will continue charging the basket in practice under Fennelly’s direction. She insists she hasn’t arrived yet, and that makes her coaches excited. \n“We’ve got a lot to learn still,” Steyer said, “but it is fun when that ceiling is pretty darn high to keep getting better.” Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
