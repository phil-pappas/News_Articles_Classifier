The visitors were eventually all out 48 overs at the Moti Bagh Stadium. \n\nFast-medium bowler Hardik Pandya (5/61) and left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh (4/31) were the wreckers in chief, sharing nine wickets between them. Legspinner Karn Sharma, who has played a Test and two ODIs, was the top scorer for Railways with a knock of 51 off 84 balls. He hit seven boundaries and a six. \n\nLeading the side, Rawat made 20 off 24 balls, while Krishnakant Upadhyay struck a breezy 26 off 28 balls with the help of four boundaries and a six. \n\nAt stumps on Day one, Baroda trailed by 48 runs with nine wickets remaining in their first innings. Opener Kedar Devdhar was unbeaten on 69 and home team skipper Aditya Waghmode was on 30 when stumps were drawn for the day.
