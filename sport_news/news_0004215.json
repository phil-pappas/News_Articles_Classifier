He and I have had some very good chats these past few weeks, and during those chats it has become clear to me that Ron is both utterly determined and uniquely equipped to lead our team through its current difficulties to great successes in the future. \n\"That gives me great confidence, and it is for that reason that, together, he and I have decided to continue our partnership; and, as soon as I had made that decision, straight away I realised it was the correct one.\" \nHowever, conspicuous by its absence in McLaren's announcement was any mention of Fernando Alonso following a torrent of speculation at last week's Japanese GP that the Spaniard will quit the team. \nThe two-time champion quelled the furore by tweeting on Sunday night that \"no one should have any doubt that I have 3 years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team\" but whether that message amounted to a firm commitment he will stay with the team or was merely confirming the length of his current deal is open to interpretation. \nMcLaren have repeatedly insisted that Alonso will stay on but their decision to only officially confirm Button's retention will once again whirl the rumour mill into life. \nIt is understood McLaren's option to retain Button for 2016 expired on September 30. \n'Button last year negotiated a two-year McLaren deal, believed to be worth £18million (£6million for 2015, £12million for 2016),' Sky F1 pundit Mark Hughes wrote in his post-Suzuka column. \n'As is quite common, the payment was 'backloaded' - i.e. the lion's share comes in the second year - with a contract break on McLaren's side that would allow it to nullify the contract at the end of the first year. In this way, the team is protected if it feels the driver has under-delivered because the team isn't actually committed to anything in year two.'
