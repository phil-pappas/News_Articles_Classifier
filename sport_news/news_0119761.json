(Photo: Johanna Coyne) Story Highlights The Redwood Rangers girls tennis team has won 144 straight consecutive West Yosemite League matches. Redwood is led by a freshman. Claire Yang is 20-1 overall in singles action this season. The Rangers can clinch their 13th straight WYL title with a win over El Diamante on Monday. 12 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nRosemarie Lewis remembers her first West Yosemite League loss as the Redwood girls tennis coach. \nIt came in the middle of October against Golden West. \nThe year was 2002. \nLewis didn’t like that uneasy feeling, and since that bitter defeat, Redwood has reeled off 144 straight wins in WYL action. \n“It’s something that we’re really proud of,” Lewis said. “But we don’t dwell on it. Also, it’s not about the streak. It’s about winning league, winning the league for our school. It’s for the pride of our school.” \nDuring that reign of supremacy, the Rangers have won 12 consecutive WYL championships, and that doesn’t seem to be slowing down any time soon with Lewis still at the helm. \nLewis, a 1976 Redwood graduate who won a Valley title under the tutelage of Sy Inamine, has built a program based around Inamine’s principles of commitment, determination and hard work. \n“He’s one of the greatest men that I have ever known,” Lewis said of Inamine. “I just wanted to make sure that the program was continuing like how he spent the 30-something years making sure that Redwood had a premier tennis team. That’s my motivation. Like any player, you just want your coach to be proud of you.” \nLike Inamine’s style of coaching, hard work is behind the on-court success. \nAnd that starts a few weeks before the previous school year ends every summer. \n“The girls know that from the get-go, it’s going to be a lot of time commitment,” Lewis said. “Physically, to be out here during the summer when it’s 105 everyday is tough, but that’s the weather that we play in, so that’s how we train. It’s just a mindset. If this is something you aren’t accepting, or willing to do, then tennis is not for you because I don’t expect being mediocre. I expect them to be exceptional, and we have that conversation the first week of practice.” \nIn the past, some players have quit on Lewis during the brutal triple-digit heat training regiments. \nBut for the ones, the headstrong players, who ride out the wave, the success is worth every blood, sweat and tear. \n“We practice over the summer,” Rangers senior Juliette Garcia said. “Not every other school does that. We practice harder and stronger than other teams. I think that’s how we have stayed consistent. We also just have it set in our mind — winning is our goal. It’s just a tradition. It’s normal for us.” \nGarcia, along with sophomore Kate Sapasap, entered 2015 as the only Redwood players with varsity-level experience. \nThe Rangers graduated six seniors from last season’s 18-4 team, and with a young squad was expected to rebuild, not simply reload. \n“We didn’t really know who was going to be here or not,” Garcia said. “But I knew that we could build our team up, and strengthen it the way we wanted too. It was going to be easier to mold, since we were younger.” \nHowever, with the arrival of Claire Yang, one of the top emerging players in Central California, Redwood may be in line to capture not just its 13th consecutive WYL championship, but a Central Section Division II crown. \n“We have good depth right now,” Lewis said. “That’s where we are head and shoulders above everyone else. Without Claire, Juliette would have been a great No. 1, and Kate a solid No. 2. With Claire coming in, everyone was pushed down a slot, so that just makes the team deeper.” \nThe Rangers have spent the past five seasons in Division I, and with how they performed recently in the postseason (they were knocked out twice in the quarterfinals in 2012 and 2013, and in the first round in 2014), Lewis appealed for a return to Division II. \nLewis argued that Redwood, based on its smaller enrollment, couldn’t compete with the likes of a Buchanan, which has a student pool of more than 2,500 potential athletes to draw from, on a year-to-year basis. \nThe section agreed and approved Lewis’ request. \n“It’s tough to compete against Buchanan, Clovis, Clovis West when they field a school of 2,500, and we only have a school of 1,700,” Lewis said. “Our numbers gear us for Division II.” \nYang, despite being just a freshman, is already Redwood’s No. 1 player on the singles ladder. \nYang won the Visalia Tennis Invitational Division I individual girls crown on Sept. 18, and owns an impressive 20-1 overall singles record. \n“She definitely makes us a better team,” Lewis said of Yang. “By far, I would say she’s one of the top three tennis players that we have ever had at Redwood, so she’s in a class by herself right now.” \nAfter Yang, Garcia boasts an 18-3 individuals record, and Sapasap, the Rangers’ No. 3 player, is 19-2. Alexis Cervantes owns an 18-3 mark. \nWith a 9-0 clean sweep over Hanford West Monday — which included dominating wins by the aforementioned players — the Rangers improved to 9-0, and can clinch at least a share of the league championship with a win over El Diamante on Monday. \n“It’s my passion,” Lewis said. “I had the greatest coach and the best memories, and that’s what I want these girls to have — great memories and fun times. But I also want them to get a life lesson. Nothing in the world comes easy, and you got to work for things that you want.” 12 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1KKbyOU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:17:33.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
