No silver lining for Rutgers in loss to Ohio State \nIn head coach Kyle Flood’s first home game since returning from a school-issued three-game suspension for impermissible contact with a faculty member, Rutgers lost by 42 points as it did last season at Michigan State. \nBut only a touchdown pass from Hayden Rettig to Andre Patton with 13 seconds remaining prevented the most lopsided loss since Louisville’s 56-5 win in 2005. \n\"We didn't perform very well as a program tonight,\" Flood said, \"and that begins with me. And really, filters through the entire program.\" Buy Photo Rutgers football battles Ohio State, Saturday, October 24, 2015, in Piscataway.

Ohio State fans show Rutgers supporters how it's done \nPerhaps feeding off the noise at kickoff, Rutgers marched 64 yards on 12 plays on the opening drive. Quarterback Chris Laviano converted a fourth-and-1 with a quarterback sneak but the drive stalled out before another first down and Flood summoned Federico for a 29-yard kick. The inconsistent Federico, who drilled the 26-yard field goal as time expired to complete last week’s comeback victory, banged his kick off the left upright, letting the life out of the stadium. \n\"One kick doesn't define any kicker,\" Federico said. \"Through the ups and the downs. \nHe added, \"Kicking is a fraction of inches. You can mishit the ball an inch that way and there it goes.\" Buy Photo \nRutgers wide receiver Janarion Grant spins during a second quarter kick-off return against Ohio State, Saturday, October 24, 2015, in Piscataway. (Photo: Jason Towlen/Staff Photographer) \nRutgers offense did not recover in the first half, punting on each of its next five possessions and only crossing midfield once while falling behind 21-0. \n\"When we put Kyle out there, we have confidence that he'll make that kick,\" Flood said. \"We would have liked for him to have made that kick. But is that the reason? I don't think so.\" \nIt didn’t get any better in the third quarter, but the score was 49-0 by the time that Flood pulled Laviano in favor of the backup Rettig. \nFans calling for Rettig, a LSU transfer, to start had been quieted with Laviano’s performances in the last two games but are sure to speak up again. \nLaviano finished 10-of-20 for 117 yards with one interception on the heels of posting the fourth-highest passing yardage total in school history (386 yards) against Indiana. \nRettig went 3-of-7 for 72 yards and a touchdown. \n\"I don't think it was one of Chris' better performances,\" Flood said, \"and I don't think Chris got a lot of help.\" \nLeonte Carroo, who played through an ankle injury, had three catches for 55 yards but did not have after halftime because he was \"physically not able to play in the second half,\" according to Flood. \nOhio State, which rushed for 283 yards out-gained, Rutgers 530-293. \n\"We didn't play well,\" Laviano said. \"It's not a secret. You can't just not play well against a good team.\" \nBelieve it or not, it took a while for Ohio State’s offense to click on all cylinders, even after coach Urban Meyer made a quarterback change during the week in search of a spark. \nYes, a spark for the top-ranked and arguably most talented team in the nation. Dual-threat J.T. Barrett led two touchdown drives in a span of four minutes in the second quarter – both of which lasted four plays and covered at least 65 yards – to make it 21-0. Barrett connected with Michael Thomas for a 50-yard touchdown strike – Thomas stiff-armed cornerback Isaiah Wharton and split two defenders– and then rushed his way into the end zone. \nOhio State needed only four plays to score a touchdown on its first second-half drive as well. \nMeyer had a little fun at Rutgers’ expense in the third quarter, as Barrett flipped a 1-yard pass to Jalen Marshall as he came down the line of scrimmage in motion. Marshall froze and acted like he was going to pass on a trick play, then cut back and hurdled the goal line for a touchdown.

(Photo: Jason Towlen/Staff Photographer) \nIt was the first time Rutgers hosted the No. 1 team in the nation or the defending national champions since Miami left with a 42-17 win – after trailing for three quarters – in 2002. \nWith no score late in the first quarter, Ohio State caught a break from the officials as Ezekiel Elliott appeared to be stopped short of the marker on third-and-1 from Rutgers’ 3-yard line. Run-heavy Ohio State uses key passes in rout of Rutgers \nThe run was ruled a first down and confirmed on review even though television replay showed Elliott getting dragged backwards after reaching the line of scrimmage. Broadcasters Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit finished criticizing the call just as Elliott scored on the next play. \nElliott, a Heisman Trophy candidate, ran for 142 yards and two touchdowns. Barrett added 101 rushing yards and two scores to his passing line of 14-of-18 for 223 yards and three touchdowns. \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1N0cyRD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:59:55.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
