ESPN's \"College GameDay\" crew held it show in Salt Lake City in front of a sea of roaring fans. Former Utah Jazz superstar John Stockton joined the set, and Lee Corso finished the show by picking the Utes to win the game.\nWith the sunset and the stadium lights on, the Utes faced off against the California Golden Bears, a matchup featuring the final two undefeated teams in the conference.\nIt was a turnover-heavy game, and it came down to the wire, but in the end, Utah came away with the 30-24 win.\nHere is the report card for the Utes:\nOffense\nUtah's offense wasn't nearly as productive as it was against the Oregon Ducks, and the way in which the Utes moved the ball became very one-dimensional.\nRunning back Devontae Booker had an exceptional game. The senior carried the ball 34 times for 222 yards and two touchdowns. He also added 45 yards in the receiving game. He was the battering ram the Utes used to wear out the Cal defense, and he played his part well.\nThe passing game struggled to find a consistent rhythm, and for that reason, the Utes put up less points than they should have. With the exception of a 54-yard touchdown pass that quarterback Travis Wilson had in the second quarter, the senior had trouble throwing the ball accurately.\nWilson completed 16 of 26 passes for 170 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. Both interceptions came on back-to-back drives and were because of a lack of accuracy. Coming into the game, Wilson had been one of the more efficient passers in the nation, but he had an off night.\nOverall, the offense had the luxury of relying on Booker's production, and he came up big for the team. Wilson will have better nights in the future, so that is something Utah can hang its hat on going forward. As for Saturday, the running game was strong, but the passing game was weak, and the team committed three turnovers.\nGrade: C+\nDefense\nThe Utah defense stepped up against a very good offensive team and made big plays throughout the game, which kept the Golden Bears from winning the game. All season long, the Utes have given up yards, but they have been able to force turnovers. Such was the case against Cal.\nThe Utes gave up 467 total yards to the Golden Bears, which is more than the Utah offense put up. But once again, the defense forced turnovers, as they produced six against Cal. The Utes intercepted quarterback Jared Goff five times, which is extremely impressive considering the caliber of passer that he has become.\nThe defense also made a key stop on Cal's final drive of the game, sealing the victory for Utah. Goff was moving the ball well, so the Utes had to dig deep to make the necessary stops to pull out the win.\nOverall, Cal moved the ball, but by forcing the turnovers and making key stops, the defense was the primary reason Utah won the game.\nGrade: A\nSpecial teams\nUtah had a solid game in the special teams department, and there were very few errors made.\nPunter Tom Hackett punted the ball four times in the game for 203 yards, two of which landed inside of the 20-yard line. Hackett's ability was on full display late in the game when he punted the ball 51 yards, downing it at Cal's 5-yard line.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-boxscores.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/results/2015-2016/boxscore48393.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:54:23.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
