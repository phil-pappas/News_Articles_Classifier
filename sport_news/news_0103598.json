Cavallaro scored all four touchdowns and added a two-point conversion to lead Old Colony to a 29-0 victory over Cape Tech on a raw and blustery Saturday afternoon on the Crusaders’ home field. Cavallaro had 17 carries for 117 yards and scored three times on the ground while also catching three passes for 27 yards and a touchdown as the Cougars evened their record at 2-2. Old Colony led 8-0 at the intermission and with Cavallaro rushing for 80 yards in the second half, the Cougars pulled away to hand Cape Tech (0-4) its fourth straight defeat. The Crusaders defense bent but didn’t break in the opening 20 minutes, stopping the visitors twice on downs and getting interceptions by Collin Frye and Izayah Silva in the final minute of the first half. But a fumble on the opening possession of the third quarter halted Cape Tech’s drive and flipped the momentum in Old Colony’s favor. “I wouldn’t say we got physically wore down - we just made mental errors down the stretch,” said Cape Tech coach Chris Leonard. “It’s tough to swallow when we’re practicing so hard and doing the right things and not having it translate out here.” Cavallaro’s 3-yard touchdown run with 1:32 left in the first quarter followed by a two-point conversion rush by Ryan Baker accounted for the lone scoring in the first half. After forcing the turnover early in the third quarter, the Cougars needed just eight plays to go 69 yards with Cavallaro scoring on a 16-yard run around left end then added the conversion rush to make it 16-0. Junior quarterback Jack Murphy was an efficient 13-for-17 through the air, including an 11-yard TD pass to Cavallaro just 25 seconds into the fourth quarter. Andrew Maurer’s interception gave the ball right back to Old Colony and two plays later, the 5-10, 155-pound Cavallaro completed his day with a 45-yard jaunt down the left sideline. “We challenged our guys this week to be physical and we have some good skillsSTORM kids who can get out in space,” said Old Colony co-head coach Brandon Mendez. “We didn’t take too many chances downfield, but the short and intermediate passing allowed the middle to be open to run the ball.’ An intermittent rain fell during some of the afternoon, but it was the wind gusts up to 30 miles per hour that made trying to come from behind a challenge. It made last Saturday’s sun-splashed afternoon seem as long ago as the Fourth of July. “We talked all week about throwing the ball and then we get a day like this,” Leonard said. “We just have to do a better job of getting the ball in our playmakers’ hands.” Tory Berto had two catches out of the backfield for 17 yards and ran hard all day for Cape Tech while sophomore quarterback Justin Lucas had 73 yards passing while being harassed throughout the day. Two-way lineman Dustin Rutko had another solid effort up front but the Crusaders were without fullback James Moore, which limited their power running game on a day when it was sorely needed. Linebackers Justin Dean and Tyler Martin were also sidelined with injuries.
