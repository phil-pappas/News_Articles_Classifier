But especially to us.\" \nAnd especially to Klinsmann. \nHis team comes into the game having won only one of its last four games, with two of those results coming in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, where the U.S. finished outside the top three for the first time since 2000. It followed that with a one-sided loss to Brazil. \nSo with World Cup qualifying beginning next month, some critics say Klinsmann should lose his job if the U.S. loses Saturday's game to its fiercest rival. That's not likely to happen. Klinsmann is signed through the 2018 World Cup, so his job may be one of the few things that won't be on the line Saturday. \nThe most important prize at stake is CONCACAF's berth in the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia, an important eight-team dress rehearsal for the World Cup. Close behind, however, is national pride. Mexico not only dethroned the U.S. as Gold Cup champion last summer, but it hasn't lost to the U.S. in the Rose Bowl since 1994. \nAnd the last time the teams played there, in 2011, a loss did cost a U.S. coach his job, with Bob Bradley's postgame sacking opening the door for Klinsmann.

Rose Bowl, packed to the brim. \n\"When you talk about this game, form goes out the window. Whatever's happened in the last few months, whatever's been achieved in the last few months, whatever's written, whatever's said, when that whistle blows it doesn't count for anything.\" \nThe roster Klinsmann's called up underscores the game's importance. Seven of the 23 players have made at least 50 appearances with the national team and four have played more than 100 games. Sixteen were on last year's World Cup team -- including the Earthquakes' Chris Wondolowski -- and more than half the players are at least 29 years old. \n\"You need a roster of 23 guys where you really feel, as a coach, that in this one specific opportunity, they are the right ones to get the job done,\" Klinsmann said. saturday's game", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:46:23.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
