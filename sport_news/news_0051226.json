Comment Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 5:00 PM ROSEPINE — Since their season-opening double-overtime win against Merryville, the Rosepine Eagles have fallen on hard times. Several players have been bitten by the injury bug, some for the season. Others are battling back from nagging injuries, playing positions not familiar to them. And even though they are struggling, head coach Danny Cain and the Eagles (1-5, 0-1) have a chance to right the ship at McKee-McCain Stadium at 7 p.m. tonight when the Oakdale Warriors (2-4, 0-1) come to town for a District 3-2A contest. The game is also serving as the homecoming contest for the Eagles, with alumni returning to see these young Eagles attempt to break a five-game losing skid. But it won’t be an easy task. The Warriors, coming off a 35-14 loss at the hands of the Pickering Red Devils, are hungry for a win. The Warriors feature a very balanced offensive attack, along with a very veteran defensive squad. Offensively, the Warriors rely on first-year starting quarterback Terrance Holmes, who completed just 7-of-19 passes a week ago for a touchdown and 53 yards. His favorite target is Derion Dunn, who caught four of those seven completions a week ago, including the touchdown. The Warriors also have a solid running game, led by the exploits of Quindale Thomas and James Evins III. Thomas logged 19 carries for 76 yards last week against Pickering, while Evins had 95 yards on six carries, including an 87-yard touchdown run. “Oakdale has some big-play capability and that’s a concern,” Cain said. “They have very skilled players and we have put some things in to try to scheme against that.” The Eagles, on the other hand, suffered through a 58-0 loss at the hands of the Menard Eagles, managing only 91 yards of total offense. Covey Landen provided Rosepine with some solid play offensively with 57 yards rushing on just six carries as the Eagles rushed for a total of 71 yards. Coleburn Johnson lined up at quarterback for the Eagles most of the time, completing 4-of-12 passes for 15 yards, while Seth Ducote also took some snaps. Lawrence Willis, who moved back to tight end last week, was the leading receiver with four catches for 20 yards. “Oakdale is a very athletic team and I’m looking forward to a very spirited contest,” Cain said. “They are going to get in our face and challenge us. We need to be just as aggressive as they are and counter that aggression with some of our own.” Next week, Rosepine will visit rival Pickering in the Battle for the Big Dog Jug, while Oakdale will be at home against Many.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:14:36.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
