Two years after being created, Oakland played Riverdale in the first \"Battle of the 'Boro\" in 1974. Too much animosity between the two schools to play the first two years after old Murfreesboro Central split. \nFast forward to 2015 and the Patriots are sitting atop the district, having won two in a row over their rival. First year head coach Kevin Creasy knows with Riverdale, Smyrna and Cookeville left on their schedule, anything can happen... \n\nRiverdale Assistant Coach Will Kriesky says the \"Battle of the 'Boro\" is always special... \n\nOakland won the last two years...42-20 last year and 41-7 in 2013. Riverdale's last win was 17-14 in 2012. While Riverdale leads the overall series by a wide margin, since 2007 they're 4-and-4 against each other. \nBy the way, in all of those years, there's only been bragging rights for the winner. That is, until this year when the first ever Battle of the 'Boro Trophy will go to the winner. The perpetual trophy will go to each year's winner and will have all of the winners, dating back to 1974. The trophy was created by NewsRadio WGNS and L&K Trophy House and will become a symbol of the regular season football matchup between these two schools. \nState Farm Prep sports begins at 6 with the Thompson Services Friday Night Thunder Pregame Show. The DIRECTV by EnterSource Pregame Show is at 6:30 with kickoff at 7pm.
