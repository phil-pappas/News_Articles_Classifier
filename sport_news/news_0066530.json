The Mountaineers dominated the Eagles 31-13, snapped GSU’s 11-game Sun Belt winning streak and took a big step forward in trying to follow their rivals with a Sun Belt title of their own.\nThe Mountaineers (6-1, 3-0 Sun Belt) came into the game boasting the nation’s fifth-ranked defense and showed Thursday those numbers weren’t deceiving because of their schedule. Averaging respectable numbers in both rushing and passing defense, they limited the nation’s leading running attack to a season-low 188 yards and never let the Eagles’ passing game get off the ground.\n“We ran into a really good team,” Eagles coach Willie Fritz said. “Just a frustrating night. They outplayed us. Give credit to them.”\nThe Eagles (5-2, 2-1) threw the early punch, uncharacteristically electing to receive the opening kickoff and marching down the field almost unabated for a nine-play 86-yard drive capped by quarterback Kevin Ellison flipping over a defender and into the end zone.\nWhatever fire the Eagles had was extinguished by a Mountaineer defense that attacked the ball and almost seemed to know what was coming. The Eagles gained just 29 yards of offense from that point until halftime. Junior running back Matt Breida was limited to 78 yards on 14 carries, about 5 yards below his season yards per carry average of 10.3.\n“We felt good about things after our first series,” Fritz said. “Guys just never stayed on schedule throughout the game. A loss here, a minus-play there. We weren’t in good down-and-distance situations.”\nThe Mountaineers, meanwhile, kept the GSU defense off balance by mixing up the play calling. Taking advantage of good field position, Marcus Cox gave the Mountaineers the lead early in the second quarter by slicing through the defense to an 18-yard touchdown run.\nThe next drive, ASU sophomore quarterback Taylor Lamb hit Cox, who was left alone coming out of the backfield, for a 30-yard pass play. Two plays later, Lamb hit Simms McElfresh in the back of the end zone on a rollout, giving App State a 10-point lead. Lamb later hit tight end Barrett Burns for a 33-yard TD in the second half and finished 14 of 20 for 202 yards and two touchdowns. Cox gained 96 yards on 21 carries with two scores.\nThe Eagles missed their opportunity to maybe change the direction of the game after forcing App State to a three-and-out to start the third quarter. GSU ran a perfectly called play-action pass on its next drive, and Myles Campbell streaked downfield uncovered, but Ellison’s throw caused Campbell to make a tough adjustment, allowing a Mountaineer to catch up and make the tackle.\n“That was an opportunity to get a touchdown,” Fritz said. “A touchdown and we’re right back in the game with a lot of conference.”\nThe gain got the Eagles 28 yards to the ASU 14-yard line, but they went nowhere from there, and Alex Hanks missed a 35-yard field-goal attempt.\nAll night, the App State defense took away the GSU running game on first down and forced the Eagles into passing situations. It paid off in the third quarter when Kevin Ellison threw an interception to Mondo Williams.\nBackup quarterback Favian Upshaw couldn’t do anything to lift the GSU passing game. He missed on three attempts when he came in for a series in the fourth quarter, including an interception. The Mountaineers then bled the clock on a 13-play drive that lasted over seven minutes and ended with a 6-yard scoring run by Cox.\nThe Eagles finally scored a meaningless touchdown in the fourth quarter when LA Ramsby ran for a 19-yard touchdown.\nDobson kept out\nGSU senior safety Matt Dobson did not play in Thursday’s game after sustaining an ankle injury in Saturday’s 56-26 win against New Mexico State.\nFritz said Dobson could have played in the second half after the win if the Eagles needed him, but injury appears to have been more complicated than expected. Linebackers Ironhead Gallon and William Bussey were also sorely missed in the first half, having to sit out as a result of being called for targeting in the second half against New Mexico State.\nGeorgia Southern 7 0 0 6 — 13\nAppalachian St. 3 14 7 7 — 31\nFirst Quarter\nGaSo—K.Ellison 12 run (Hanks kick), 11:11.\nApp—FG Matics 44, 8:35.\nSecond Quarter\nApp—Cox 18 run (Matics kick), 10:48.\nApp—McElfresh 9 pass from Lamb (Matics kick), 3:48.\nThird Quarter\nApp—B.Burns 33 pass from Lamb (Matics kick), 4:00.\nFourth Quarter\nApp—Cox 6 run (Matics kick), 6:33.\nGaSo—19 run (run failed), 3:31.\nA—24,121.\nGaSo App\nFirst downs 13 22\nRushes-yards 38-188 48-231\nPassing 64 202\nComp-Att-Int 5-13-2 14-20-0\nReturn Yards 8 19\nPunts-Avg. 5-43.6 4-48.0\nFumbles-Lost 0-0 0-0\nPenalties-Yards 4-26 5-40\nTime of Possession 26:39 33:21\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING—Georgia Southern, Breida 14-78, Ramsby 9-58, K.Ellison 10-46, W.Fields 4-7, Upshaw 1-(minus 1).
