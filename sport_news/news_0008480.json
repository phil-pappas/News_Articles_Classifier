Oscar built this house to entertain,\" Scott said on the YouTube video while clutching a tin of beer. \"Hot girls can invite themselves.\" \n\n\"Every weekend it is going to go down here,\" Mokoape added. \n\nPistorius was found guilty last year of culpable homicide - a charge equivalent to manslaughter - after saying he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder. \n\nThe two men were filmed standing in the bathroom where Pistorius shot Steenkamp through a locked toilet door, with Scott giving his own version of the killing. \n\n\"They had a fight... he went after her, she ran away, locked herself in the bathroom,\" Scott said. \"(She) said she is going to phone someone and he shot her. That's what happened.\" \n\nThe Star newspaper said that Pistorius family spokeswoman Anneliese Burgess described the video as \"bizarre\". \n\nPistorius, who was given a five-year jail sentence, was due for release in August but his parole has been repeatedly delayed in a long legal battle. \n\nThe parole board will meet again on Thursday to reconsider his case for release on house arrest. \n\nThe world-famous Paralympian athlete sold the house to cover legal costs and it was reportedly bought by a mining consultant. \n\n\"I feel bad for Reeva's parents and my heart goes out to her family. What he did was wrong,\" Mokoape said in the video. \n\nThe News24 website said Scott had apologised for the video, admitting it gave a \"totally wrong message\". \n\n\n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:14:03.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
