(AP) - Charlotte Motor Speedway has painted lines on the race track to mark where the restart zone will begin and end Saturday night. The zone is typically marked by NASCAR with the lines on the outside wall that aren't seen by fans. Charlotte has painted the marks to make the zone clear in what's been an ongoing issue. Drivers have complained for the last several months about shenanigans in the restart zone that NASCAR was not policing. NASCAR three races ago assigned an official to monitor the restart zone at track level, and it is now using in-race reviews to decide if a driver broke the rules. Brad Keselowski was flagged for jumping the restart at Dover two weeks ago. He's so far the only driver to be penalized. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
