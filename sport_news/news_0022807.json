The school launched an investigation of all 28 members of the men's team. \nUniversity spokeswoman Kristine Brown tells NJ.com ( http://bit.ly/1Ldsttn ) the investigation found no intent to coerce any of the team members to participate. But Brown says the behavior was unacceptable and considered hazing. \nThe team's coach canceled practice and the team was suspended from competing in a Rider-hosted meet Sept. 19.
