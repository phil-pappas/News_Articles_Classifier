As the team gears up for the last six games of the 2015 season, the Bobcats hope to stay healthy, strong and near the top of the league standings. \nThe Cats have a much needed rest this week, with their only game being against Sterling on Saturday at 2 pm. The Cats will host Sterling and take advantage of being on their home turf looking to reverse the outcome from their first game against the Tigers, where Sterling won 4-1.
