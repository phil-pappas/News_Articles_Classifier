Sean White got his chance and did nothing to lose it, according to Gus Malzahn. \nSo why all the buzz about Johnson regaining his job as Auburn's starting quarterback against Kentucky? \nThe last time we saw Johnson taking snaps, he looked bewitched, bothered and bewildered at LSU, and afterward he sounded defeated. The only way he could've regained the trust and confidence of his coaches and teammates in the interim would've been through his performance at practice. \nHow did Johnson win the job in the first place in the spring? How did he earn the trust and confidence of his coaches and teammates? \nThrough his performance in practice during spring ball and fall camp. \nWhat would make Malzahn and Rhett Lashlee think that Johnson has demonstrated a newfound ability to take his play from practice to the game? \nRELATED: Jeremy Johnson still acting like Auburn's starter \nIt's true that White hasn't exactly looked like a program changer during his two starts against Mississippi State and San Jose State, but it's hard to make an impact when all the coaches ask you to do is hand off. It makes you wonder how much confidence the coaches have in the redshirt freshman's ability to run the entire offense. \nThe Auburn running game has been solid, but it's not the force it was the last two years. Hard to imagine the Tigers lining up and beating Kentucky or anyone else while throwing only 10 passes, as White did against San Jose State. \nThe Auburn season is headed toward a crossroads Thursday night in Lexington. Win that game, and there's hope for the rest of the season. Lose it, and good luck avoiding a winless slide through the entire SEC schedule. \nAuburn's ability to win that game likely will be determined by the play of its quarterback, and the play of the quarterback will say a lot about the ability of Malzahn and Lashlee to choose the right man at the right time. \nWill White get another shot but without handcuffs? Will Johnson be given a chance to redeem himself? Will Malzahn pay unintentional tribute to Steve Spurrier by using both quarterbacks based on the feel and flow of the game? \nOr will Malzahn shock the world and ask Jason Smith to do his best Nick Marshall impression? \nThe time Auburn played a football game in Commonwealth Stadium, its quarterback delivered a Heisman-level performance, running for 198 yards, passing for 210 more and dominating the drive to a game-winning field goal on the final play. The only thing we know for sure right now is, at the most important position on the field, the Tigers are a long way from Cam Newton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:51:33.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
