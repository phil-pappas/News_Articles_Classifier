They visit Kansas City to begin a best-of-five AL Division Series against the Royals on Thursday night at Kauffman Stadium.\n“It kind of reminds us of us last year,” Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas said after a workout Wednesday, “young and hungry and out there trying to prove to everybody that we deserve to be here.”\nThe Royals certainly accomplished that 12 months ago.\nAfter ending a 29-year postseason drought, the plucky bunch of youngsters swept all the way to the World Series, where they fell in seven games to the San Francisco Giants . But it was the Royals’ dramatic, extra-inning victory over the Oakland Athletics in their AL wild-card game that instilled in them a belief that they could play with anybody in baseball.\nMuch like Tuesday night in the Bronx seemed to galvanize the young Astros.\nThey clowned around before the first pitch, then took care of New York when it was time to get serious, before resuming their playful antics with a rousing 30-minute postgame party.\n“You know, we did it in a little more dramatic fashion than they did,” Royals manager Ned Yost said of the wild-card win, “but they played a very solid game, took advantage of mistakes, excellent pitching and defense. Both teams play with a lot of passion and energy.”\nIn other words, both teams have a whole lot of fun.\n“I don’t know if anybody else picked up on that, just as a fan watching what they were doing last year,” said the Astros’ Collin McHugh , who will start Game 1. “You can tell they have a fun clubhouse. I think that’s probably the closest similarity I can see with our team.”\nThere are others, though. Both endured long periods of ineptitude, underscored by 100-loss seasons. Both were painstakingly built through the draft. Both clubs put a premium on speed and defense. And both have formidable bullpens and stout rotations, with the Royals sending out hard-throwing Yordano Ventura to face McHugh in the opener.\nThe similarities are hardly lost on Astros manager A.J. Hinch , who played for the Royals in the early 2000s, when the organization was down.\n“I think both teams sense the opportunity might be there to make a run in October,” Hinch said. “Certainly, they’ve been a year or two ahead of us in this, I guess, move to the middle of relevant baseball with their run last year. But both really good clubs.”\nReally young clubs, too. The average age of Houston for its wild-card game was 28 years, 343 days. The Royals were an average of 29 years, 51 days to start last year’s World Series.\nThe Astros and Royals are not mirror images of each other. Houston pounds home runs at the expense of strikeouts, while the Royals play to contact and grind out runs. The Astros greedily accepts walks while Kansas City swings away, regardless of the count.\n“We had a good run last year, but that was last year,” Moustakas said. “This is a new season now, the best team is going to win. We have to find a way to beat that club.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:07:27.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
