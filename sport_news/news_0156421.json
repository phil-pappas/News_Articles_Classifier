Michael Johnston, 57, died from an unspecified illness. The Airbus A320 jet left Phoenix just before midnight Monday and diverted to Syracuse Hancock International Airport shortly after 7 a.m.\nUpon descent, crew members told the 147 people on board that the pilot was ill and the flight was being diverted, several passengers told Boston's WFXT .\nPhoto credit: @NBCNews / Twitter ; WFXT – Boston \"They just said, 'Hi. We have to make an emergency landing. The pilot's not feeling well,'\" said Michael Litterio. \"When we landed, we thought that he just wasn't feeling well. We had no idea he had passed. It was extremely shocking.\"\n>> Read more trending stories\nWFXT obtained air-traffic control communications as the co-pilot of Flight 550 prepared for an early landing.\n\"Syracuse, American 550 is out at 15,000 for 5,000,\" the crew said. \"Medical emergency, the captain is incapacitated.
