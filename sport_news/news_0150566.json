(AP) â€” Several people who were competing in a boat race in northern Massachusetts have been hospitalized for possible hypothermia.\nOfficials say the 36th annual Textile River Regatta competition on the Merrimack River in Lowell ended earlier than expected Sunday afternoon after high winds sent water into at least two rowing boats, known as shells.\n Three people were brought to a hospital to be observed for potential hypothermia as the result of cold and windy weather.\nDeputy Fire Chief Robert Destrempe says the Fire Department helped five regatta participants out of one shell and nine from another that had been taking on water. All participants were ordered out of the water shortly after.\nThe event included masters, collegiate, high school and other classes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:03:44.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
