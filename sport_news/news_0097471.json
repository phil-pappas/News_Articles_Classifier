So we saw many different things and many different people, but everywhere we've been people were really welcoming us really well so that was nice,” says Nolwenn Bouvep, one of the international students.\nThe student's presentation is a part of the exhibition that runs until December 29. It explores the French immigrant experience in southeast Kansas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:21:57.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
