On Thursday, Oct. 8, yet another life was lost unnecessarily in an accident on the Bull River Bridge.\nThe Bull River Bridge is a two-lane curved bridge that doesn’t allow for any evasive maneuvering should a passing vehicle drift into your lane. Many fatal accidents have taken place here as a result. After reviewing the accident report, it is evident that the current design of the bridge was a contributing factor to the tragic result of this accident.\nThis comes on the heels of the causeway being closed for several hours due to high tides a few weeks ago. Tybee was completely isolated from the mainland with no means of vehicular ingress or egress.\nAdditionally, this past spring and summer, the causeway and bridges were the scene of several accidents which led to complete gridlock for hours. In one incident, as a car sat idling while one of these wrecks was cleared up, it stalled out and due to complex built-in software, the vehicle could not be put in neutral and was not moved off of the single westbound lane for four hours leaving drivers and passengers stranded on Highway 80. In these situations, emergency vehicles have great difficulty getting on or off the island.\nAny one of these issues, in isolation, would seem to be enough to draw attention to the need to fast-track solutions to this problem. I commend the county for stepping up and funding a study which we are told will lead to some interim solutions such as better signage, more intelligent lane striping, etc., by the spring time.\nBut ultimately, what is needed is a long term fix that prevents head-on collisions, raises the road bed, allows for emergency vehicle access and prevents people from being stuck in traffic trying to get on or off the island.\nThis issue has been ongoing for well over 20 years. The solution preferred by the Metropolitan Planning Organization and the State Department of Transportation calls for building two new two-lane bridges with shoulders on both sides and a bike lane, adding wider shoulders to the present lane configuration on the causeway and raising the causeway at its low points. We have been informed that this imperfect solution is at least four years from breaking ground due to a cumbersome federal permitting process relative to the surrounding marshes coupled with complex issues associated with acquiring right-of-way from the Department of the Interior. We built the Panama Canal in 10 years. Surely, we can build two relatively small bridges and widen a six mile long causeway in less time.\nFurthermore, the MPO and GDOT need to take a close look at the solution they are proposing. Their assertion is that because Tybee is basically built-out, current traffic volumes will stay relatively constant in the future. But as the Savannah area grows, more and more locals will come to Tybee to enjoy the beach. As a result, traffic volumes will continue to rise. And the cause of many accidents is the current lane configuration that they are proposing to maintain. As two lanes of traffic merge into one eastbound near the entrance to Fort Pulaski and westbound at the entrance to the Rails-to-Trails, traffic gets snarled on busy weekend days. In fact, it doesn’t even take an accident to completely tie up traffic as a result of this issue. It is as if we have a constant construction zone in those two areas where two lanes merge into one.\nWhile I do not want to delay the proposed project, spending more money to go a little wider on the bridges and causeway and place dividers between the eastbound and westbound lanes is much more fiscally prudent than coming back 20 years from now to build and permit two more new bridges and a wider causeway. This can be done in an environmentally and aesthetically sensitive manner.\nEvery year, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are spent in Georgia building new or wider roads to grow commerce and lessen commute times. What ought to get top priority are projects that save lives.\nJason Buelterman is mayor of Tybee Island.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:05:09.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
