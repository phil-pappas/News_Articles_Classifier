(AP) - Steve Spurrier says that he made the decision to resign as South Carolina's head coach because the team was heading in the wrong direction. He told a news conference Tuesday: \"We've slipped. It's my fault. I'm the head coach.\" Spurrier was in the middle of his 11th season. The Gamecocks were 2-4 overall and 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference for the first time in Spurrier's career. He had never had a losing season in 25 previous seasons coach at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) or South Carolina, where he has been since 2005. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
