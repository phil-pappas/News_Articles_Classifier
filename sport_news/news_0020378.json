Gallop said the Phoenix application for a 10-year extension \"does not meet the requirements we see as fundamental to the future growth of the A-League.\"\nLocal media reports suggest Wellington's place may be offered to a third Sydney-based team.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Wellington+refused+10-year+license+extension+in+A-League", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-26T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:16:41.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
