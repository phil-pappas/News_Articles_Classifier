See him taking the smallest freshman and that being his workout partner. That's the kind of leader he is, pulling up from the bottom taking the team with him.\" \nAnd that attitude has led the Patriots senior quarterback to the endzone over 100 times, and landed him multiple offers to play in college. \n\"There's been offers from [division] two and three schools around here,\" says Lesser. \"Whitworth, Willamette, and walk on opportunities at Portland State and Idaho State.\" \nBut that's for later this year. Right now, he's more focused on lighting up defenses and winning a state championship. \n\"I'm really focusing on senior year, getting it done with the team,going game by game, and getting back to the tacoma dome and winning it,\" says Lesser. \nBut between his 3.7 GPA and the time he spends working off the field, it's his work ethic that sets him apart. \n\"Always have to get your homework done. Then you get lifting in, get the team in, and I watch film about half an hour or hour in every night, get that in.\" \nYou'll definitely see him in pads next season, and whatever teams lands him is going to get one of the hardest workers, and fastest runners, in the Tri Cities.
