He said he was against expansion for two reasons: there are already a number of events for middle- and long-distance runners, specifically cross country; and any change could alter team scoring in meets.\nHe pointed to the addition of the 4x200-meter relay as something that has shifted the scoring balance at track meets to favor a sprint-heavy team.\n\"Any time we monkey with rules we've had for track and field that we've had for so long and has worked really well, every time we have, it's come back to bite us,\" Breithaupt said. \"I'm sensitive to the things that have been in place a long time.
