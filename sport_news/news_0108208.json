Who exactly was responsible for his release is up for discussion, but Jackson has clearly holds a bit of ill will toward general manager Doug Whaley.\nIn an article for The Players' Tribune , Jackson detailed what he calls his \"toughest road trip,\" having to pick his life up in Buffalo, where his wife and kids still live, and move to Seattle after he signed with the Seahawks. In the article, Jackson explains the weeks leading up to his release. He suffered a hamstring injury in training camp and recalls asking general manager Doug Whaley if should worry about his job security. He didn't want to sit out if it meant losing his job.\n\"He told me they knew what I brought to the table and to focus on getting healthy — that I didn't have anything to worry about,\" Jackson wrote.\nJackson was cut as part of the Bills' first round of cuts and it was a move some reported that Whaley made on his own. After a preseason game against Detroit, Whaley gave his side of the story .\n\"No, it's not an easy move,\" Whaley said. \"It wasn't. He's been the heart and soul of not only our team but the community. It's one of those things where we decided it something we had to do and especially the timing we thought would be best for him and obviously look, he went out to Seattle and everything. But to say I acted alone ... that would be irresponsible for me to do something without informing the coaches, the owners, the running back coach, the offensive coordinator.\"\nJackson will always have a special place in the Bills' organization, and Buffalo he seems intent on making Buffalo his home. Unfortunately, it seems like the breakup wasn't a clean one.", "external_links": ["http://www.theplayerstribune.com/fred-jackson-seahawks-bills/"], "published": "2015-10-10T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:53:41.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
