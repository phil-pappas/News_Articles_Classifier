Team president Howard Cornfield was said to be traveling, and not available for comment.\nThe extent of Soto’s alleged misconduct was not immediately clear. Sources characterized it as sharing of information, such as starting lineups, with former teammates. It is unclear whether there was any intent to sabotage the Scorpions.\nSoto, 26, played for the Scorpions during their inaugural season in 2012, scoring two goals in 25 games while on loan from Major League Soccer ’s Houston Dynamo .\nHe returned in 2014 after a brief stint with now-defunct Chivas USA , and has no goals or assists in 14 appearances this season.", "external_links":
