He originally faced five charges.\nAuthorities say he fired a handgun twice inside the high school on April 27 before a teacher tackled him.\nNo one was injured in the incident.\nEarlier this month, Thurston County prosecutor Wayne Graham withdrew a motion asking that the teen be tried in adult court. Graham says he made the decision based on a psychologist's evaluation of the teen.\nHe is scheduled to appear in court again next Wednesday.\nHe is being held at a juvenile detention center.\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://is.gd/eOnLUD", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:00:53.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
