There's no such thing when it comes to NHL goaltending. Barring one anomaly in Pittsburgh, Carolina Hurricanes head coach Bill Peters witnessed some stellar preseason netminding capped off by mainstay Cam Ward's 35-save finale. \"Wardo, to me, since I've been here, has been very, very good,\" Peters said. \nThen there's offseason acquisition Eddie Lack, who surrendered just five goals in three games while turning away 67 shots. \n\"Eddie's been excellent in the room. He has an excellent work ethic,\" Peters said. \nNeither goalie shrinks from the competition in the locker room or on the ice. \nLack wears a picture of his former Vancouver teammate, starting goaltender Roberto Luongo, on his helmet. Sharing time between the pipes is nothing new to him. \n\"It's kind of like what I feel like I've been having the last couple of years with (Roberto) Luongo and (Ryan) Miller. The better goalie is going to play, but we can still push each other on and off the ice,\" Lack said. \nPeters likes that vibe. \n\"It's gonna get competitive. It's going to be a very, very competitive environment from within for ice time and roles on our team, so when you win, as a coach, I like to reward the guy, the goaltender and put him right back in,\" he said. \nWith the regular season set to start on Thursday, the hot hand rests in the left glove of the 11-year vet from Saskatoon. \"I'll tell you right now, we play on the 8th, and it'll be Wardo. And I'll just go from there,\" Peters said. \nDepending on the opponent, the schedule and performance, that strategy may change. But Ward is once again the go-to guy in goal for Carolina as a new season begins.
