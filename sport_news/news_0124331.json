Primary school color for both is maroon. Similarities end there for Missouri State and Southern Illinois, who meet Saturday night at Salukis Stadium. Missouri State has not been close in its three defeats, with the average margin 49 points. The Salukis’ three losses are by a total of five points. “We’re in a situation where we’re trying to find that extra play,” Southern Illinois coach Dale Lennon said. “When you go through a stretch like we have, you have to make sure everyone is still on board and feel good about who we are. “We’re not feeling sorry for ourselves. We know we are a good football team and know the breaks will go our way at some point.” Here are three things to watch as the Salukis try to get over a small hump and the Bears try to climb a mountain. Offense flying high: Southern Illinois’ offense has not been its issue. The Salukis are fifth nationally in total offense (509 yards per game) with a good distribution between passing (291 yards) and a league-leading rushing attack that averages 218. Quarterback Mark Iannotti leads the team in rushing and has completed 73 percent of his passes. He’s a similar type of player as Indiana State quarterback Matt Adam, who had a huge game against the Bears last week. Turning it over: The biggest reason Southern Illinois has the three narrow losses is turnovers. Iannotti, if he has a flaw, has thrown four interceptions and the Salukis are minus-7 in turnover margin. Missouri State is minus-six in turnover margin with quarterback Brodie Lambert, while completing 57 percent of his passes, has five interceptions in 76 attempts. Along with taking better care of the ball, coach Dave Steckel said the defensive emphasis in practice this week was on getting turnovers. Gearing up on the ground: The Bears’ rushing game, thought to be a strength going into the season, has yet to get untracked. This might be a good opportunity as opponents are averaging 185 rushing yards against a Southern Illinois defense led by the Valley’s top two tacklers – linebacker Chase Allen and safety Kenny James.
