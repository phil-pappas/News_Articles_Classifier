(Maurizio Degl’Innocenti/ANSA via AP) more > By   \nPARIS (AP) - Qualifying for the largest-ever European Championship was supposed to be easy. \nWith only two games left to play, however, the Netherlands is in danger of missing out, and Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his teammates are also close to elimination. \nFour teams - Iceland, the Czech Republic, England and Austria - have already qualified to join host France, with 19 of the 24 places still up for grabs. \nThe top two from the nine groups and the best third-place team qualify automatically. The eight remaining third-place teams can qualify through the playoffs in November. \nHere’s a look at the nine groups: \n___ \nGROUP A \nThe Netherlands is facing the real possibility of failing to qualify for the European Championship for the first time since 1984. \nIceland and the Czech Republic are already through, with Turkey third and playing the top two teams in its final push for a playoff berth. \nIf Turkey beats both, it will reach the playoffs and eliminate the Dutch. \nThe Netherlands plays last-place Kazakhstan in Astana on Saturday and takes on the Czechs the following Tuesday in Amsterdam. \nThe Dutch have a long injury list to contend with. Captain Arjen Robben has not recovered from a groin injury. Also out injured are Daryl Janmaat, Davy Klaassen, Quincy Promes, Ron Vlaar and Stefan de Vrij. \n___ \nGROUP B \nThe expanded format of Euro 2016 offers one clear advantage: big stars from small countries will get a chance to shine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:15:46.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
