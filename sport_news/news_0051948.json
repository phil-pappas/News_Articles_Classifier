That’s what the D-League will do, it’ll add to his potential. Getting minutes in a game is so much more valuable than practising over and over.” \nMoments after Ujiri shocked the basketball world with the Caboclo selection, ESPN pundit Fran Fraschilla famously summarized the youngster as an NBA prospect “two years away from being two years away.” \nThe drive-by scouting report has become synonymous with Caboclo, the project of all projects in the Raptors pipeline. Uriji made an obscure but savvy selection, experts noted. \n“I think we’re more than happy with the pace at which he’s been developing over the past year, and I think the D-League will just speed that process up even more,” Tolzman said of Caboclo, who appeared in seven D-League games for the Fort Wayne Ants in 2014-15, averaging 3.4 points and 0.7 blocks per contest. \nDespite banking only 25 total minutes of floor time as a rookie NBAer, there’s plenty to be intrigued about when it comes to Caboclo. \nThe former Basketball Without Borders MVP from Sao Paulo, Brazil, is already a cult favourite, as evidenced by Raptors fans chanting “We want Bruno!” at the tail end of blowout wins last season. \n“He’s getting more comfortable,” Raptors star DeMar DeRozan said. “We just tell him to go out there and play, not think too much. He’s got time to learn. He’s got a long way to go, but he’s still young. The more he’s out there on the court, the better.” \nAs the 2015-16 campaign nears tipoff — the Raptors finish their pre-season schedule Friday in Montreal versus the Wizards before playing a meaningful game next Wednesday at home against the Indiana Pacers in the season opener— Caboclo still looks like a teenager experiencing an awkward growth spurt. \nCaboclo, who has averaged 14 minutes and 2.3 points in six NBA pre-season games so far, is 6-foot-9 and 212 pounds but you might as well pencil him in a few inches taller. \n“With his long wingspan, people sleep on that,” new Toronto big man Anthony Bennett said. “People don’t really know about that until they see him (in-person).” \nWith the introduction of Raptors 905, those in the GTA will be able to do just that. \n#WETHE905? \nMLSE’s trendy #WeTheNorth branding has added a second layer. \nThe Raptors have a little brother in the Raptors 905 minor league squad. \nThe presence of a local D-League team should provide the Raptors with efficiencies. For instance, two groups will be on the same page in terms of structure and strategy. \n“We want to build a team that plays with the same mentality (and has) the same culture as the Raptors,” Tolzman said. \nThe relationship, in an ideal world, will evolve into something similar to what the Marlies and Maple Leafs have developed over time — a geographical and cultural mash-up of sorts. \n“The main goal is to have the team as tightly connected to the main Raptors team,” he added. “The goal is to have a seamless transition for all of the assignment guys that we send down. We want it to be all the same: plays, language, everything.” \nRaptors 905, a nickname saluting both the mothership and the motherland’s area code, will offer “NBA basketball at an affordable price and without having to travel downtown,” explained Tolzman. \nTwenty games at the Hershey Centre and a pair at the ACC comprise the home schedule, which begins Nov. 19. \nLAY-UPS AND PUTBACKS \nWant a glimpse of off-day DeRozan? Raptors 905 games might be a good place to start: “I plan on sitting courtside and supporting the boys on our D-League team,” the shooting guard said with a grin … Raptors alumnus Jerome (Junkyard Dog) Williams was on hand Wednesday. Williams mingled about, trading a few of his signature barks with fans and seemed to be genuinely enjoying himself in the area he called home for four seasons … Andrea Bargnani can’t escape being the butt of a joke. The ex-Raptor is in danger of missing the Brooklyn Nets’ season opener. The notorious 2006 No. 1 pick, signed in July by the Nets, practised in non-contact drills on Wednesday but is day-to-day with a tight hamstring after missing the entire pre-season ... Split right down the middle, 41-41, TSN and Rogers Sportsnet will share national TV broadcasting duties for the Raptors this season, the club announced Wednesday. Bell Media’s TSN will air the season and home opener, while Sportsnet debuts Nov. 8 when the Raptors visit the Heat in Miami.
