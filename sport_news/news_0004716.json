His response was priceless.\nLatest Jets stories Todd Bowles: M-E-T-S, Mets, Mets, Mets! Patriots troll Jets on Twitter, again Ex-Pat Ridley fired up to play old team Week 7 picks: Jets-Pats, Giants-'Boys, more Richardson issues guarantee -- sort of \"You just made my stomach want to throw up,\" he said, laughing.\nStory Patriots troll Jets on Twitter, again Story Ex-Pat Revis eager to face former team Column Glauber: Belichick's praise of Jets is on target \"But really, it's hard. It's very hard. When you look at them on tape, they pose a lot of problems. You kind of see it on their film with the matchup issues they create. They really do. The guy running the show is outstanding, so it's a difficult task.\"\nThe first-place Patriots (5-0) have the second-best overall offense in the NFL, behind the San Diego Chargers. They're averaging a league-leading 36.6 points per game and are second in passing yardage (325.2).\nBill Belichick has a host of weapons at his disposal, but the 6-6, 265-pound Gronkowski is one of the toughest matchups the Jets will face Sunday.\n\"I would say he's one of the hardest,\" Rodgers said of the three-time Pro Bowl tight end. \"There's a lot of really good tight ends throughout the league, but when you start listing them, his name is going to be one, two or three. His size, his strength, his catching ability, his blocking ability, versatility, I could keep going on and on. He's a very talented player.\"\nJets coach Todd Bowles mentioned Gronkowski's size but also highlighted his intelligence. \"His size overshadows everything,\" Bowles said. \"I think what everybody fails to realize is he's a very smart player. He's just not big and tough, he's a smart player and he has very good feet. When you line up somebody like that at the wideout position, that's a tough cover.\"\nJets Ex-Pat Ridley fired up to play old team So how have other teams covered Gronkowski this season?\n\"I don't see anybody covering him,\" Bowles said, laughing. \"That's the problem . . . Everybody has tried everything. He's probably seen every coverage that he's going to see in his lifetime. Doubles, triples, vices, top, he's seen everything. You just have to be smart and be able to make your share of plays.\"\nOne of the challenges of game-planning for Gronkowski is the fact that it's hard to mimic his size and speed in practice. Rodgers said the coaching staff has resorted to using several players to imitate him, but 6-4, 235-pound practice-squad tight end Wes Saxton \"has been running around for the speed,\" he said.\nWith so many targets to cover, Bowles and Rodgers must figure out the best way to deploy their players. That won't be an easy feat, considering slot cornerback Buster Skrine still is in the concussion protocol and Marcus Williams (hamstring) still is practicing on a limited basis.\nAsked if the Jets have considered moving Darrelle Revis into the slot to cover Gronkowski or Edelman, Rodgers said: \"That's the case right there when you have Edelman and Gronk. Where do you put your best cover guy? They create a lot of problems that way. For us, we're bouncing around a lot of different things and see what works for us.\"\nJets Richardson issues guarantee -- sort of ", "external_links": ["http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.eplayer.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:00:23.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
