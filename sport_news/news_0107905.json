Nashville's last two wins have come via a shootout. \nPredators goalie Pekka Rinne allowed four goals on 29 shots through overtime, but he was sharp in the shootout, denying all three Lightning shooters. \nNeal has five goals and two assists in his last three games. \nSteven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov, Ryan Callahan and Erik Condra scored for the Lightning, who have dropped three of four. \nIn the tiebreaker, Forsberg skated to the right and beat Lightning goalie Ben Bishop with a quick wrist shot. \nNashville trailed by a goal late in the third when Neal notched his second of the night on a one-timer from the right faceoff dot off a pass from Forsberg. \nFisher scored the game's first goal with 52.3 seconds remaining in the opening period. \nWeber carried the puck into the Lightning zone on the right side. From below the goal line, he sent a pass to Fisher who was stationed just outside of the crease. Fisher established position on Tampa Bay forward Ondrej Palat and then sent the puck past Bishop. \nThe Predators have scored first in each of the team's six games this season without allowing an opponent's goal against in the first period. \nThe Lightning tied it at 3:25 of the second period on Stamkos' power-play goal. \nFrom the blue line, Victor Hedman found Stamkos on the goal line to the left of Rinne, where Stamkos banked a shot off the inside of Rinne's left goal pad and into the net. \nKucherov was credited with his second goal of the season when the rebound of his initial shot deflected off the skate of Nashville's Paul Gaustad and past Rinne at 8:51 of the second. \nWeber tied it at 2 at 10:29 of the second on a one-time from the left point. The goal was the Nashville captain's first of the season. \nCallahan and Neal traded late second period goals to send the teams into the third period tied at 3. \nNOTES: Nashville played without Ds Ryan Ellis (lower body) and Barret Jackman (upper body). Victor Bartley and Anthony Bitetto, who both played their first game of the season, replaced them in the lineup. ... Neal extended his points streak to three games. ... Hedman returned to the Lightning lineup after missing Saturday's game against Buffalo. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:24:43.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
