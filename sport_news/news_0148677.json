He's out because of a concussion suffered during the season opener against Jacksonville. \nHouston running back Arian Foster is set to make his debut this season. He missed the first three games of the season after tearing his groin early in training camp. \nBears quarterback Jay Cutler makes his first start since he strained a hamstring in the first half of a 48-23 loss to Arizona on Sept. 20. He will be without one of his favorite targets in wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, who is out for the third straight week with a hamstring injury. \nTight end Vernon Davis is out for the 49ers' game against the Green Bay Packers, while running back Reggie Bush is returning for the first time since injuring his left calf in a Week 1 win against Minnesota on Sept. 14. \n___ \nJACKSONVILLE AT INDIANAPOLIS \nColts: QB Andrew Luck, CB Greg Toler, RB Tyler Varga, DT T.Y.
