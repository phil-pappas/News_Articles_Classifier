Cain © Mike Carlson/Getty Images . Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith will be out four to six weeks following surgery to repair a right knee meniscal tear, the team announced Tuesday.\nAdChoices \"Duncan underwent successful surgery today to repair his right knee meniscal tear,\" Blackhawks head team physician Dr. Michael Terry said in a release. \"The surgery was successful and we expect him to return to full hockey activities in approximately 4-6 weeks.\"\nThe loss of Keith is a big blow to the Blackhawks, whose main weakness is arguably a lack of depth on the blue line. An assistant captain, Keith has been the leader of a strong defense for years. Last season, Chicago ranked second in the NHL in goals against per game at 2.27.\nKeith was the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs when the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup last season. He was the winner of the Norris Trophy as the NHL’s best defenseman in 2013-’14.\nKeith has two assists in six games this season while ranking 17th in the NHL in average ice time at 24:21 per game. Since his NHL debut in 2005, Keith has played at least 74-plus games. He has never missed more than eight games in a season during his career.\nThe Hawks haven't specified how or when Keith suffered the injury. He played the entire game in Saturday's 4-1 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets . T\nThe Hawks were already active in the trade market looking for a defenseman and now likely will have to shop around for added depth.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/chicago-blackhawks", "http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=783973&hootPostID=60f439b4ab66c15b86febbbe114d5f9e", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/columbus-blue-jackets", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/56112/duncan-keith"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:43:37.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
