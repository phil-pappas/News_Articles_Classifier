I watched and saw Patrick Kane score the second goal. The only reason I watched it was become of Kimmo.\"\nWatching on his laptop last June, Voracek loved seeing Timonen raise the Cup.\n\"I was so happy for that because, let's be honest, he really deserves it,\" Voracek said. \"He gave a lot to the game and he finally got rewarded in the NHL. It was something fantastic. To watch him raise the Cup and watch him be so happy ... for what he'd done for that, it was incredible.\"\nVoracek played three seasons in Philadelphia with Timonen, who missed most of last season recovering from blood clots. Before playing his first game, he was traded to Chicago on Feb. 27, went on to win the Cup and then retired at age 40.\n\"I don't think it could happen to a better player and person than Kimmo,\" Voracek said. \"I'm sure this whole locker room was cheering for Chicago last year.\"\nVoracek was a little envious. He says seeing Timonen win a Cup makes him hungrier to do it.\n\"A hundred percent,\" he said. \"Let's be honest, it's why we play the sport. To win it here one day would be something incredible.\"\nRandy Miller may be reached at rmiller@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @RandyJMiller .
