Nasarawa United midfielder Bature Yaro and Gbolahan Salami scored the goals for the Super Eagles. In-form Warri Wolves hitman Salami, who scored in the AFCON qualifier against Chad in June, was not fit enough to start the game, so Chima Akas captained the side. There was also no place in the starting line-up for Chisom Chikatara with Tunde Adeniji leading the hosts’ attack. The Home Eagles dominated the game from the start, but the Burkinabe were determined to keep a clean slate. Bature scored the opener in the closing stages of the first half. The Eagles wasted a number of chances to increase the lead afterwards which prompted the introduction of Salami and Chikatara for Osas Okoro and Adeniji. Chikatara missed a glorious opportunity to increase his side’s lead in the 67th minute when he failed to hit the back of the net following a one on one situation with the Stallions goalkeeper. Salami made it two for Nigeria in the 77th minute, converting from the spot after Ezekiel Bassey was hacked down in the box. The return leg comes up next weekend in Ouagadougou.
