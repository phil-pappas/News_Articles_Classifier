(Chuck Crow/The Plain Dealer) (Chuck Crow) Comments \nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Mike Aviles reached the plate first. He had the shortest commute. \nJose Ramirez raced home from second once the baseball struck the base of the wall in center field. Ryan Raburn hustled around the bases from his initial starting point of first base. When he arrived at the plate, the three exchanged high-fives. \nCarlos Santana muscled a three-run double through a vicious, bone-chilling wind, a powerful base knock that pushed the Tribe toward an 8-2 victory against the Red Sox. The bases-clearing extra-base hit in the third inning set the tone for an evening in which the Indians placed plenty of traffic on the base paths. \nSantana eventually scored on an opposite-field, two-out single by Chris Johnson. The four-run advantage proved to be plenty of backing for Josh Tomlin, who continues to serve as a reliable cog in the Tribe rotation. \nTomlin exited after 6 1/3 innings, having limited Boston to two runs on five hits and two walks. He struck out five and made only one mistake. \nDavid Ortiz clubbed that miscue into the seats in right field. The veteran slugger watched the baseball sail over the fence as he held his bat high in the air, before he commenced a trot around the diamond deliberate enough to anger pace-of-play advocates. \nOrtiz's two-out blast also scored Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who had reached on a single in the previous plate appearance. \nThe Indians didn't rest on their two-run lead, however. Yan Gomes slapped an RBI double to right in the fifth inning to score Santana. Two batters later, Jerry Sands doubled home Gomes. Abraham Almonte then blooped an RBI single over Bogaerts' head as the shortstop gave chase in the outfield grass with his back turned to the plate. \nSands socked a solo home run to right field in the seventh to provide the final margin. The Indians finished the game with 12 hits and seven walks. \nWhat it means \nThe Indians (79-80) must win their final two games to finish the season with a winning record. \nKnocked out \nThe Indians sent Boston starter Henry Owens to the showers after just 4 1/3 innings. Owens yielded seven runs on 10 hits and four walks. \nWeb gem \nTribe shortstop Francisco Lindor made a diving stop to his left and threw out Red Sox outfielder Rusney Castillo to end the second inning. \nWatching C-San \nSantana tallied two hits, two walks and two runs in Friday's contest. With runners in scoring position this season, Santana owns a .263/.396/.469 slash line. \nExtra bases \nJesus Aguilar socked a pinch-hit double to left field with one out in the eighth. It marked Aguilar's first career big league extra-base hit. \nAll aboard \nJeff Manship tossed 1 2/3 scoreless innings of relief. The right-hander lowered his ERA to 0.93. Manship walked one and did not allow a hit. \nThey came, they saw \nAn announced crowd of 28,273 watched the affair at the ballpark. That total, according to Indians PR, includes receipts from previous rainouts. \nWhat's next \nThe Indians and Red Sox will reconvene at Progressive Field on Saturday, as Corey Kluber makes his final start of the season. Kluber (8-16, 3.62 ERA) surrendered six runs on six hits in six innings against Boston at Fenway Park on Aug. 19. That outing followed a pair of complete-game victories for Kluber against Minnesota. The Red Sox will counter with Craig Breslow, who will be making his second career start. Breslow, who has logged 522 career relief appearances, tossed four scoreless innings against the Orioles last week in his only big league start. The southpaw made seven appearances for the Tribe in 2008.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:44:26.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
