Chowdary told PTI here.\nHe said an enquiry has also been instituted in the matter by the Commission.\nChowdary said the role of bank officials will be looked into to find out their involvement in the scam.\n“The involvement of the officer of the central government or of the bank, in so far as facilitating this scam is concerned, will be certainly looked into.\n“We will also look into the aspect of bringing any systematic changes and how a system should be introduced in the banks to give an early indication on this kind of thing,” he said.\nHis comments assume significance as Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha had yesterday said that the scam is a one off incident and not a reflection of any systemic problem in the banking sector.\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (and Enforcement Directorate (ED) are probing transactions of Rs 6,100 crore to Hong Kong from a Bank of Baroda’s Ashok Vihar branch here.\nThe huge transaction is believed to be trade-based money laundering as the amount was transferred in garb of payments for imports, that never took place.\nAs per CBI probe so far, Rs 6,100 crore were transferred through nearly 8,000 transactions done between July, 2014 and July, this year. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:06:21.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
