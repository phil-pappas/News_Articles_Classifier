It's been here the whole time ... just now that we're getting to the playoffs and on a national stage ... it's a shock to a lot of people.\" \nKeuchel, who shut down the Yankees in the A.L. wild-card game, worked out of jam after jam, allowing five hits and one run with seven strikeouts after going 15-0 at home this season, a modern major league record. He has a 1.45 ERA at Minute Maid Park in 19 starts this year. \n\"The ball in Dallas Keuchel's hand brings an awful lot of confidence to a lot of people. Including me,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \"And he came up with some excellent pitches.\" Advertisement \nLuke Gregerson gave up a leadoff homer in the ninth to Alex Gordon before finishing off the Astros' first playoff game in Houston in 10 years with a four-out save. It was his first save of more than three outs in three years. \nJason Castro drove in two runs with a single in the fifth that made it 2-1. Carlos Gomez, who has a rib muscle strain, started for the first time in the series and had an RBI single in the sixth. \nCarter's soaring solo homer, which landed on the train tracks atop the wall in left-center, and came on Danny Duffy's first pitch of the seventh pushed the lead to 4-1. \nCarter, batting .199 in the regular season but .455 in the postseason, was a triple shy of the cycle for the Astros, who were hosting a playoff game for the first time since the 2005 World Series. \n\"After struggling so much this year and just having the success I've been having in the last couple of weeks, it's been nice to contribute and help us win games,\" Carter said. \nLorenzo Cain hit a solo homer in the fourth for the Royals, who are on the brink of elimination after reaching the World Series last season. \nKeuchel wasn't as sharp as he was in New York, but he was able to tiptoe out of trouble again and again and got deep in the game despite a pitch count that got high early. He finished with a season-high 124 pitches. \n\"You get to this type of scenario and you don't capitalize, you get what happens today,\" said Royals manager Ned Yost. \nHouston rookie Lance McCullers opposes Yordano Ventura in Game 4. It will be the postseason debut for McCullers, who turned 22 on Oct. 2. Blue Jays 5, Rangers 1: Troy Tulowitzki drove in four runs, including a three-run homer for his first hit this postseason, and Toronto avoided elimination in the A.L. Division Series with a win in Arlington, Texas. The Blue Jays cut their deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-five matchup. Tulowitzki's drive to left with two outs in the sixth inning put the Blue Jays up 5-0. That was two innings after he drew a bases-loaded walk. He missed most of the final three weeks of the regular season because of a cracked shoulder blade and bruised muscles in his upper back. \n\"It was definitely huge, and in the moment I was definitely pumped up,\" he said of the home run. \"Got back to the dugout and everybody's obviously excited to put us up by five. A little breathing room, I think that's the goal down 2-0.\" \nToronto manager John Gibbons said: \"Tulo needed that, he really did. He had that long layoff after the injury, and then it's been kind of a battle for him. Maybe that sets him off. ... If he catches fire, we're real dangerous.\" \nTexas has another chance Monday to clinch the series at home. If not, a deciding Game 5 will be played Wednesday in Toronto, where the Rangers won the first two games. \nTexas' Derek Holland starts Game 4 against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey. It will be the first career postseason start for the 40-year-old Dickey. He got his first big league win with the Rangers in 2003 and became a knuckleball pitcher two years later. \n\"It's funny how it's come full circle,\" Dickey said. \"It's poetic, is what it is for me. It's a neat narrative.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:00:53.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
