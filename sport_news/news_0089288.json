I believe that you could think that, if you are Monaco, you could have sold him as well next season. \n\"So I thought they would not sell him this year because they sold many other players. \n\"I thought they would maintain their word. He was not sellable. He was not on the list. He was one of the players Monaco did not want to sell, so we never made an approach for him. \n\"Only an acceptable amount of money after could do it. We always liked him, even when he was in Lyons.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:35:54.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
