But in a way, it's embracing the chaos.\nThe corner will be the site of Portland's first \"pedestrian scramble,\" where all traffic is stopped and pedestrians can cross in any direction, including diagonally. The new signals are expected to be switched on before the end of the year.\nThe intersection, just outside an entrance to Powell's City of Books and near a streetcar stop, is currently an all-way stop that's frequently clogged by a continuous flow of pedestrians and traffic backed up at Burnside.\nThe scramble is sometimes seen by traffic engineers as inefficient because it stops auto traffic in all directions, and pedestrians can in some cases have to wait longer to cross.\nBut at 11 th and Couch, a light one block away that gives Burnside traffic an extra 30 seconds of green already acted as a bottleneck, said Peter Koonce, the transportation bureau's manager for signals and street lighting.\n\"You'd be showing green at Couch, but you'd be stopped,\" Koonce said. \"More green wouldn't help you.\"\nThe city's engineers found they could better synchronize the signals and let traffic cruise through both lights if they add a 30-second cycle for pedestrians.\nThe corner was desolate in 2000, when Powell's built an addition and new entrance at 11 th and Couch, the bookseller's chief executive, Miriam Sontz, said Wednesday. But the development of the Brewery Blocks and the subsequent redevelopment of the warehouse district that would become the Pearl District brought foot, bike and vehicle traffic never previously imagined.\n\"It's just too small an intersection for the number of people and cars trying to go through it as a four-way stop,\" she said. \"It's all because of the growth that has gone on in that area, and nobody here is complaining about it, but the traffic patterns have not kept up.\"\nThe signal, she said, will be a welcome change, and the all-way crossing for pedestrians will be \"a fascinating experiment.\"\nThough new to Portland, there are several of these crossings in Seattle and San Francisco. In the 1960s, Denver installed the diagonal crossings, there called a \"Barnes Dance\" for the traffic engineer who came up with the idea and the maneuvering of pedestrians who meet in the middle. But the city tore them out in 2011 to make room for larger light-rail trains.\nTransportation bureau director Leah Treat saw them installed in Chicago and Washington, D.C., before coming to Portland.\n\"I've seen how they can make public space more comfortable and inviting,\" Treat said in an email. \"In a vibrant retail area like the Pearl District, where there are hundreds of people living and working in close proximity, a scramble is a great way to bring order to a busy intersection and make it more accessible for everyone.\"\nThe signal is one of five new signals being installed in the Pearl and Old Town Chinatown, along with an overhaul of another signal at West Burnside and 4 th Avenue. The $2.4 million project will be paid for with urban renewal funds and real estate development fees.\n-- Elliot Njus\nenjus@oregonian.com\n503-294-5034\n@ enjus", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/enjus"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:41:00.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
