The team announced the moves Tuesday. \nThe roster is now down to 15 players. \nCotton first joined the Jazz on a 10-day contract in late February and signed a multi-year deal in March. He averaged 5.3 points, 1.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 15 games last season. \nThe release of Cotton leaves the Jazz with just two pure point guards on the roster — Trey Burke and Raul Neto. \nGraham was signed as an undrafted rookie free agent out of VCU and played with the Jazz during summer league. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:45:01.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
