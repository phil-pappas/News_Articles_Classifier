Lawyers and judges nominate candidates for this award. Then, a national awards committee of the American Inns of Court Foundation selects the honoree from the nominees,” said Eva Jaramillo, executive director of Roh’s firm.\n“In the legal community, it is an incredible honor to have a lawyer from New Mexico receive this prominent award.”\nRoh has been in New Mexico with the firm since 2007.
