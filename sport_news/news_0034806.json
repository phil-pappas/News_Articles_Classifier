The Red Sox are one of seven franchises whose below-.500 finish in 2015 was at least its third in the past four years. It's not a group anyone around here would immediately equate with, or want to. Colorado. Miami. Philadelphia. San Diego. The White Sox. Seattle. The Sox are unique in that group, of course. None of the other six made the playoffs in these four years, never mind won the World Series. To be fair, the Marlins have also played their best baseball since mid-August, but has it inspired hope and eagerness in that fan base for 2016? If Stockholm syndrome counts, I guess. At least Red Sox fans can presume a couple of their young stars might still be around in five years. Game No. 162 is in the books, yet I think it's safe to say we crave more, rightly or wrongly. The capper was seven weeks of pleasant surprises, right through Sunday's announcement that interim manager Torey Lovullo is inked for two more years and won't pursue a full-time manager's job elsewhere this winter. Perhaps it's just what it seems: Expected due deference from Lovullo to John Farrell, a man he's never stopped referring to as his friend, even as the Sox submitted their best work with the bench coach in the big chair. Lovullo spared us plenty of teeth gnashing about him heading elsewhere while the Red Sox hang on to Farrell, 12 games under .500 in five years as a manager. (Including the 2013 postseason and excluding this year's time away.) Perhaps it's simply Lovullo being happier here, with a franchise appearing closer to contending than any of the dregs who'll be hiring this winter. Perhaps it's whatever talk radio will decide it is to drum up an audience for window replacement commercials. Me? I'm not entirely sold on Farrell as the guy to lead a young roster to victory, but given the imprecise ability to figure a manager's value, bringing him back to start 2016 feels a lot better than dismissing a guy who just fought through cancer. But I digress. What matters now are these last seven weeks of data points: A 28-20 surge in which Mookie Betts and Xander Bogaerts excelled, in which Jackie Bradley and Blake Swihart impressed, in which David Ortiz surged. In which Eduardo Rodriguez (2.08 ERA) and Joe Kelly and Rick Porcello and Wade Miley all made cases to fill out a starting rotation. Thirty-five times in the last 20 years, a team went from below .500 one season to 90 wins the next. (The Cubs and Mets did this season.) Playing its best baseball to finish the year, built around young ascending talent, certainly suggests the 2016 Red Sox can join that group, even with the bullpen in tatters, last year's free-agent buys looking awful and another big expenditure needed to top the rotation. How much hope should be take from the last seven weeks? The history, at least, suggests the optimism isn't out of bounds. Five times in those 20 full seasons, a team won at least 28 of its final 48 and still finished below .500. The most recent examples are the happy ones. The 2009 Reds went from 78-84 to 91-71 in 2010 — Jay Bruce broke out — and the 2006 Indians went from 78-84 to 96-66 and within a game of the World Series in 2007. (Grady Sizemore was in the midst of his four-year run as a star there.) The 1996-97 Florida Marlins qualify, but their jump to 92 wins and a World Series was more about veteran additions than young stars. Terry Francona's '97 Phillies finished rocket-hot, but the franchise was still a decade from 90 wins. The 1998 White Sox actually finished worse in 1999 after a strong finish, though they won 95 in 2000. It's admittedly only a discussion point, but at least an informed one as we lose actual Red Sox baseball to discuss. The team that never has an unimportant offseason has another critical one ahead. Plenty to fix, but also plenty to like.
