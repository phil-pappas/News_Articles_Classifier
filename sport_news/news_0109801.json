He packed up his Packer Park apartment with the help of his girlfriend. But Goode did not leave town. \nThe inside linebacker moved into a hotel at the Navy Yard. There was no reason to leave. His friends were in the city. His brother lives in Baltimore. Goode could still work out in town. And he had that funny feeling. \nHis agent told him to stay by his phone. The Eagles called after their Week 2 loss to Dallas. The team's linebackers were banged up. They wanted to bring him back. Goode's funny feeling was right. \n\"It was a crazy process,\" Goode said. \"Something that definitely humbled me in a lot ways as far as where I need to be and things I need to do instead of being that bubble guy. Every opportunity I get, I have to take full advantage.\" \nGoode played nine snaps at linebacker in Monday's win over New York after DeMeco Ryans left the game with a hamstring injury. He could play a larger role on Sunday night at Carolina as Ryans and fellow inside linebacker Mychal Kendricks continue to battle hamstring injuries. \nThe team listed Ryans and Kendricks as questionable on Friday's injury report. Inside linebacker Kiko Alonso will not play and is targeting a return after next week's bye. \nKendricks was a full participant in Friday's practice. He said on Wednesday that he is optimistic to play. Ryans was limited on Friday. He said on Thursday that he has been able to play in the past when he was limited during the week. \n\"We'll see how it goes,\" Ryans said. \"We'll see how it goes later in the week. But, I'm feeling better.\" \nIf Kendricks or Ryans do not play, rookie Jordan Hicks will again be plugged into a key role. Hicks played nearly every snap on Monday, racking up 10 tackles. Defensive coordinator Bill Davis said the 23-year-old Hicks is at the \"top of the list\" of rookies he has coached. Davis said Hicks is as calm as a veteran. The third-round pick is an early candidate for rookie of the year. \n\"One of my biggest strengths is knowing our defense,\" Hicks said. \"And being comfortable and understanding the scheme and knowing what to do on each play.\" \nKelly said he does not know why Goode was not picked up by another team after the Eagles cut him. \n\"But thank God he wasn't,\" Kelly said. \"But we have got total confidence in Naj that he can go in there and play.\" \nThe head coach said the team believes that Goode has proven to belong in the NFL. They were happy to get him back. Kelly said the team's depth at inside linebacker is a blessing. Goode is still living in his hotel room. He has to wait until Nov. 1 to move back into an apartment. He hopes it is his last move for a while. \n\"Everything is pretty crazy,\" Goode said. \"But, I'm just happy to be back and playing ball.\" \nInjury report. Wide receiver Nelson Agholor is out with an ankle injury. Defensive end Brandon Bair (groin) and wide receiver Riley Cooper (knee) are questionable. Wide receiver Josh Huff (knee) is probable. Bair, Cooper, and Huff were full participants at Friday's practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:19:32.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
