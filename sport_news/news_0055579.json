It's the fewest by an AL team leader in that time span by more than 60 games. And Laird has been gone since 2008.\nFor the price they paid -- a token cash payment to Tampa Bay -- Robinson Chirinos has been a bargain, but he's also started just under half the team's games (161) over the last two seasons. The question lingers: Is he an adequate starter or a superb backup?\nThis season, the catching load may have worn him down, leading to shoulder and biceps issues that forced him to miss most of the final two months of the season. Despite it all, the Rangers made catcher work in Chirinos' absence with strong performances by Chris Gimenez, who became Cole Hamels' personal catcher, and Bobby Wilson.\nThe big free-agent catcher on the market is Baltimore's Matt Wieters, who has played only 77 games over the last two years because of his own injury problems. More likely: The Rangers will ring up Milwaukee to investigate Jonathan Lucroy. The Rangers tried to engage Milwaukee in those talks at the trade deadline, but GM Doug Melvin was not interested in a deal. Melvin has since resigned and David Stearns is now in charge. It's worth finding out if he's more motivated.\n\"I think we're going to be careful not to covet something that may or may not be out there,\" Daniels said. \"It's a tough position in the industry to fill. At the same point, we will look at making sure we're coming to camp with the best setup we can.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @Evan_P_Grant", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Evan_P_Grant"], "published": "2015-10-20T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:03:37.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
