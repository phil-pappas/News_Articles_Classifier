That’s what they’ve been doing since grade school. David Lee is different. The 6-foot-9 forward is one of the better passing big men in the NBA. “That’s one of the things that he does best,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Saturday before practice. “His ability to see the floor. He’s still getting used to our spacing. He’s still getting used to, especially away from the ball, how he can most impact us, but with the ball he’s been good and he can pass the ball and I think our guys are getting used to not being surprised by some of the passes.” Over his 10 NBA seasons, Lee’s average of 2.3 assists has been dwarfed by his 14.7 points and 9.5 rebounds, but he knows what to do with the ball because he played point guard when he was young, before he had a growth spurt. Lee can even bring the ball up the court on the break. “As a big man, it’s very unorthodox,” Celtics point guard Marcus Smart said recently. “The guard doesn’t know what to do because (Lee’s) bringing the ball down. We’re sprinting down and now you have a big guarding another big full court. Most bigs aren’t comfortable out there. It puts them into a bind, especially when we go into our pick-and-rolls and get open shots.” It may be unorthodox, but it’s not unprecedented. Larry Bird, the legendary Celtics forward, averaged 6.3 assists. The Celtics would rather that Lee’s 7-foot teammate, Kelly Olynyk, would shoot more and pass less. “We need our bigs to be able to pass,” Stevens said. “I think passing is a skill that can separate you if you’re not the most athletic or if you’re not the greatest shooter out there, understanding the angles and passing and figuring out where your spots are and understanding what’s coming from both experience and study is very important, and he does that well. You can tell he’s played 10 years or 12 years, or whatever it is, in the NBA. It comes pretty easy to him now.” Lee didn’t talk to the media before Saturday’s practice, but earlier this preseason he spoke about how he thinks he’ll fit in with his new teammates in his first year as a Celtic. “I’m going to have a lot of opportunities,” he said, “so I think I need to be in just unbelievable shape. Talking to the guys in that first unit, if we can all be in tip-top shape, and play at a certain pace for eight or nine minutes, I think you guys would agree, that stuff is very tough to guard.” Page 2 of 2 - Asked why more big men aren’t great passers, forward Amir Johnson took exception to the question. “I don’t know,” Johnson said. “It’s that kind of your opinion? You don’t think a lot of bigs can pass?” The questioner clarified that he asked why more big men aren’t great passers. “Some bigs are just legitimate scorers,” Johnson said, “and some bigs are versatile and know how to pass and shoot. So you’ve got all kinds of different players. I think Dave is one of those versatile bigs where he can pass, shoot and dribble.” Lee can play with either hand. He’s left-handed, but he broke his left arm in high school and learned to play right-handed. “David has been around,” Smart said. “He knows the games, the in-and-outs, the little tricks and everything. He knows how to play, so you have someone like that, it’s good to have on the team. He makes things easier for you.” Stevens said everyone was available for Saturday’s practice, including Marcus Smart, who had strep throat, and Terry Rozier, who sat out the last two preseason games with a bruised left knee. The Celtics are scheduled to practice again on Sunday before hosting Brooklyn in a preseason game Monday night at the Garden. Celtics rookie R.J. Hunter is trying to gain weight and Johnson, who entered the NBA directly out of high school 10 years ago, can relate to that. He said he weighed only 205 or 210, about 30 pounds less than he does now. “They used to call me Thin Wallace when I was in Detroit back in the day,” said Johnson, who was nicknamed after teammate Ben Wallace, “but the weight gets on as you keep working as the years go by.” Hunter, normally a shooting guard, struggled at the point during a preseason loss at New York on Friday night. “I think he could definitely do it,” Stevens said, “but it might be 10 years until he does it (again).” Stevens said he doesn’t want Hunter worrying about running an offense and making shots as well.
