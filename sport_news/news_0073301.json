Afghan authorities say they are now largely back in control of Kunduz.\nPresident Barack Obama has apologized for the attack, and the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, Gen. John F. Campbell, said it was a mistake. He said the strike had been called in by Afghan forces, but he has not explained exactly how it happened or who granted final approval. Internal military investigations are underway, with preliminary results expected in coming days.\nAccording to Associated Press reporting, American special-operations analysts were scrutinizing the Afghan hospital days before it was destroyed because they believed it was being used by a Pakistani operative to coordinate Taliban activity. The analysts knew it was a medical facility, according to a former intelligence official who is familiar with some of the documents describing the site.\nAdvertisement It's unclear whether that information ever got to commanders who unleashed the AC-130 gunship on the hospital.\n\"The hospital was repeatedly hit both at the front and the rear and extensively destroyed and damaged, even though we have provided all the coordinates and all the right information to all the parties in the conflict,\" Stokes said, standing in the burned-out main hospital building.\n\"The extensive, quite precise destruction of this hospital ... doesn't indicate a mistake. The hospital was repeatedly hit,\" Stokes said. The bombing went on for more than an hour, despite calls to Afghan, U.S. and NATO to call if off, MSF has said.\nStokes, who has called for an independent inquiry into the incident, told The Associated Press in an interview in the remains of the hospital on Friday that MSF wanted a \"clear explanation because all indications point to a grave breach of international humanitarian law and, therefore, a war crime.\"\nAfghan authorities have refused to comment before investigations are complete. President Ashraf Ghani's deputy spokesman, Zafar Hashemi, told reporters on Saturday that the Afghan government has \"faith\" in investigations being conducted by the U.S. military and by a joint Afghan-NATO team.\nMSF has denied there were any armed Taliban on the hospital grounds at the time of the attack.\nMore than 70 staff members were on duty, tending to more than 100 patients at the time, Stokes said.\nAccording to its policy, MSF treats government troops and insurgent combatants equally. Hospitals are regarded as protected sites in war.\nDoctors Without Borders officials have said the U.S. gunship made five separate strafing runs over the course of an hour, directing heavy fire on the main hospital building, which contained the emergency room and intensive care unit. Surrounding buildings were not hit. The hospital is no longer operable.\nStokes said that \"until we understand what happened and we can gain guarantees that this unacceptable attack cannot happen again, we cannot reopen and put our staff in danger.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:06:02.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
