(AP Photo/Michael Perez) \nThis is not a drill: Chip Kelly is a genius again. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles overcame two red-zone interceptions from quarterback Sam Bradford to beat the New Orleans Saints, 39-17, and appear to have their offense back on track. \nDeMarco Murray, Philly’s prize offseason acquisition, carried the ball 20 times for 83 yards, and Ryan Mathews added another 73 yards rushing on just eight carries. Wide receiver Josh Huff finished with a career high 78 yards on four catches, including the team’s first touchdown of the game, complete with theatrics. The 41-yard TD was nice enough. But that Josh Huff front flip into the end zone? Mercy. #NOvsPHI http://t.co/SDoVwTRScY \nThe Eagles netted 519 yards of offense Sunday, the 11th most in Eagles history since the merger , against a terrible Saints defense, but more importantly ran 79 plays including sacks — the most this season and the highest total since Week 15 of the 2014 season . \nPrior to today, the most plays run were 68 in the season opener and the last two weeks were 55 or less — both loses. DeMarco Murray had 20 carries today and Sam Bradford threw the ball 45 times. Kelly really getting the # of plays he wants. \n— Cian Fahey (@Cianaf) October 11, 2015 \nIt’s no secret Kelly likes to run an up-tempo offense to keep opposing defense off balance, and Sunday it appears the team got back to that. \nNext week the Eagles face the New York Giants, who have allowed over 61 plays per game to their opponents in the first four weeks of the season. After that it is the Carolina Panthers, who allowed 72 plays to the Houston Texans in Week 2 and 68 to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 1. The Panthers won those two games but neither of those opponents had the firepower Kelly has at his disposal. \nAnd if Week 5 is any indication, this Eagles offense can not only weather the storm of some early miscues, it can put the throttle down and get some points on the board.
