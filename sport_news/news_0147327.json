In only the second game of the season he had suffered the ignominy of being taken off at half-time as the defending champion lost 0-3 to Manchester City. \nHis only appearance recently was in front of barely 10,000 people for a League Cup tie at third-tier Walsall. \nFor the big games, England international Gary Cahill has been partnered in central defence with the 20 year-old Frenchman Kurt Zouma. \nNeither impressed against struggling Newcastle United and Porto. Chelsea now has lost more matches than in the whole of last season. \nWith right-back Branislav Ivanovic given the captain’s armband and looking out of sorts, critics are wondering how long it can be before the Terry is recalled. \n“What must John Terry think as he watches from the substitutes’ bench while Ivanovic seemingly survives error after error, match after match?” asked the Daily Telegraph yesterday. “The reason remains a mystery,” the Daily Mail wrote. “Can they be much worse with Terry at the back? He would bring leadership and organization at least.” \nAt 34, it is generally accepted that Terry may have lost a little pace, but many observers believe his vast experience would compensate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:39:54.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
