I don't give any more answers about Wayne Rooney. I am sick of them.\" \nIn fact, United failed to muster a single shot in the first half of a Premier League match for the first time since the 2003-04 season. \nUnited also struggled to create any clear-cut opportunities during the 1-1 draw with CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday night and were indebted to Martial's second-half equaliser to salvage a point. \nVan Gaal revealed he urged his United side at half-time on Sunday to try their luck from distance as they went in search of victory over a City side missing their two star men Sergio Aguero and David Silva. \n\"We know we didn't create so many chances because it is difficult how they have played, so organised, so on the counter-attack,\" Van Gaal added. \n\"That is like the game against Moscow, the same, also organised, but it says something about the strength of Manchester United these days. \n\"But I have said at half-time we can also shoot from outside the box, you don't have to combine in the 16-metre area. Try your luck that way. That was my remark, you can shoot from outside the box. Now you can shoot, why you don't shoot?\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:34:02.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
