How do you control the adrenaline? Whether you want to fight it or not, it comes. It creeps in there. So how do you control those emotions? What a great thing. This is so awesome.\n\"And expectations. It's like Christmas time when you ask for a pair of high-tops and you get the Air Jordans. You exceed expectations already.\n\"Everything on top is frosting. And they've proven they can compete with everybody throughout the year.\"\nMartinez the manager: Manager Joe Maddon believes some team is going \"to get lucky\" if it hires his longtime bench coach, Dave Martinez, as its manager.\nMartinez has interviewed for openings with the Cubs, Nationals and Rays the last two seasons, and Maddon said he has given Martinez the same latitude that Mike Scioscia did for him with the Angels.\n\"He's really good at tough conversations,\" Maddon said. \"He's very straightforward, and up front. That's really vital. You have to have those Godfather days, man, when sometimes you just have to be blunt and honest with somebody to get your point across. He has all that.\n\"I think by having done this for several years now, he really understands pitching. That's a big part of it.\"\nCubs pride: First baseman Anthony Rizzo said the playoff appearance resonated with former Cubs.\n\"We want to make them proud,\" Rizzo said. \"They left the jersey a lot better when they were done playing.\n\"I know Ernie would be really proud of this team, Ernie Banks, and it means a lot for them.\"\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Cubs Ryan Dempster Joe Maddon Anthony Rizzo National League Washington Nationals Tampa Bay Rays", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615c4c0/turbine/ct-ryan-dempster-playoffs-bits-cubs-spt-1008-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:08:58.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
