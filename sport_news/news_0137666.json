Previously known for financing litigation costs, the Trial Funder team is now providing pre-settlement funding to plaintiffs. Investors in these cases earn 3.5% to 5% compounded monthly, which represent annualized returns of 51.1% to 79.9% to investors.\n“This innovation represents another step forward in our mission to bring high yield alternative investments to the public” says Los Angeles-based Trial Funder CEO Anoush Hakimi, Esq., “Before we launched, investors did not have access to these highly lucrative investment opportunities. A handful of industry players had a monopoly on these tremendous investments and were making all of the money. We’re going to change that!”\nNow any accredited investor can invest in a lawsuit with as little as $50. This represents a far departure from the Wall Street hedge funds that typically invest in litigation and have minimum investments of over $1 million.\nTrial Funder’s value proposition for plaintiffs and investors is much more than just pre-settlement funding and high value investments. By posting the details of the lawsuit online with rich media content and social media integration, Trial Funder exposes the litigation to public scrutiny.\nTrial Funder COO, Peter Shahriari, Esq. added, “Our platform results in larger and faster settlements. The net result is high returns for investors in short periods of time. 95% of lawsuits settle before trial, so an investor can expect a high return within as short as a few months. Litigation is a great investment class, because unlike other assets, an investment in litigation is not subject to market forces.”\nTiming for investors is critical, according to Hakimi, “We expect investors to do very well over the next few years. There is an enormous shortage of capital in this market, so it’s a buyer’s market and the deals are much more favorable to investors than in any other sector. This will change eventually, but now is the best time for investors to get in.”\n # # #\n //www.prweb.com/releases/trialfunder/litigationfinance/prweb13010598.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/trialfunder/litigationfinance/prweb13010598.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:09:09.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
