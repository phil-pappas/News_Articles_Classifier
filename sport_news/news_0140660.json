But that didn't keep the Phanatic from engaging in some rooftop shenanigans.\nThe beloved team mascot rappelled 31 stories down the face of a skyscraper on Friday. That's a 418-foot drop.\nThe event was a fundraiser for the Philadelphia Outward Bound School, which offers outdoor programs designed to build character and leadership skills.\nOrganizers aimed to have 100 people rappel during the all-day event. Mayor Michael Nutter was among them.\nFour rope lines dangled from the 1 Logan Square office building as a rotating crowd of spectators cheered below. Participants had to raise at least $2,000 for Outward Bound.\nFranklin, the furry blue canine who represents the Philadelphia 76ers, also took up the challenge.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
