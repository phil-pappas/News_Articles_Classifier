The Mets, at that point, were three and a half games behind the Nationals, while the Cubs were a game and a half ahead of the Giants for the second wild card, before dropping behind San Francisco and eventually rallying to make the playoffs with ease.\nMORE: NLDS photos | Pivotal ALCS matchups\nAfter that last regular-season encounter, the Cubs went 55-30, the best record in baseball. The Mets were not far behind for the rest of the season, at 50-32, and New York’s .611 Pythagorean winning percentage over the remainder of the campaign was tops in the National League.\nMore important than the simple fact that both teams got incredibly hot the rest of the way is that the players are vastly different — part of the reason that both teams got going the way they did. The Mets’ lineup on July 2 included Eric Campbell in left field, Darrell Ceciliani in center field and Johnny Monell behind the plate. Wilmer Flores played second base and batted fifth — fifth! — while Daniel Murphy was playing third base in place of then-injured David Wright.\nThe Cubs, too, had a different look, with Mike Baxter in right field, Chris Denorfia in center and Jonathan Herrera at third base.\nAlso, the regular-season games were a lot tighter than a 7-0 margin would indicate. Three of the four games at Wrigley Field in May were decided by one run, while the games in Queens were 1-0, then 2-0 in 11 innings before the 6-1 thumping in the final contest.\nIn the spirit of freshness, here are the players who appeared in no Cubs-Mets games this year who stand to make the biggest impact in the NLCS.\n1. Yoenis Cespedes © Provided by Sporting News The biggest addition of the trade deadline hit 17 homers in 57 games for the Mets down the stretch, and two more in the division series against the Dodgers. Cespedes also struck out eight times in 20 at-bats against Los Angeles, but the Mets will take the bad with the very, very good.\nCespedes is only 2 for 13 in his career against Game 1 starter Jon Lester, the Chicago pitcher he has faced the most. Game 3 will mark Cespedes’ first career visit to Wrigley Field. If nothing else, batting practice that day might become the stuff of legend.\n2. Kyle Schwarber © Provided by Sporting News The breakout star of the playoffs so far, having gone 7 for 13 with three homers — including that one in the clinching Game 4 that is now encased in plexiglass atop the right field scoreboard at Wrigley — made his major league debut with six games in June, then was back in the minors when the Cubs last played the Mets. He came back to the majors for good on July 17.\nThe Cubs are 41-22 in games started by Schwarber this season, including 3-1 in the playoffs. The No. 4 overall pick in last year’s draft does have one weakness, his corner outfield play, but Chicago is more than willing to live with any glove-related deficiencies to have his bat in the lineup.\n3. David Wright © Provided by Sporting News The only player on the Mets roster who remains from their last trip to the NLCS, in 2006, Wright went 1 for 16 with seven strikeouts in the division series against the Dodgers, though the hit was a very important two-run single in Game 1.\nOut almost all year with spinal stenosis, Wright hit .289/.379/.434 with five homers in 38 regular-season games. The Mets are 26-17 with him in the lineup, and his struggle-filled division series — much like teammate Lucas Duda and Cubs phenom Kris Bryant — makes you wonder if natural peaks and valleys in performance set the stage for a possible NLCS MVP turn.\n4. Javier Baez © Provided by Sporting News After a season spent partly in the minor leagues, out with a broken finger and with only 28 games in the major leagues, in which he hit .289/.325/.408, Baez took over at shortstop for the Cubs in Game 4 of the division series after Addison Russell hurt his hamstring and went 4-for-5 with a homer the rest of the series.\nBaez actually played more in the majors last year, when he hit nine homers but struck out 95 times in 52 games. His power at the bottom of the order adds an interesting wrinkle to Chicago’s offense, especially given Joe Maddon’s penchant for batting his pitcher eighth. On Tuesday, Baez became the first position player in National League history to start a playoff game in the No. 9 spot in the order and homer.\n5. Michael Conforto © Provided by Sporting News Picked six spots after Kyle Schwarber in last year’s draft, Conforto made his major league debut on July 24 and hit .270/.335/.506 with nine homers in 56 games. He played sparingly in the division series, starting only twice because the Dodgers started left-handers in three of the five games. Conforto was only 1 for 7, but the hit was a home run off Zack Greinke.\nConforto likely will be sitting again when the NLCS starts, with the Cubs throwing southpaw Jon Lester in Game 1. He will then be thrown into the fire against Jake Arrieta, so good luck, but Conforto has shown himself equal to most challenges so far as a major leaguer.\n6. Trevor Cahill © Provided by Sporting News Cahill pitched this year for the Braves, AZL Dodgers, Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, Oklahoma City Dodgers and Iowa Cubs before getting to Chicago at the beginning of September. After pitching 11 games for the major league Cubs, the 27-year-old right-hander worked three times against the Cardinals, striking out six in 2 2/3 relief innings.\nThe Mets have seen Cahill this year, but it was almost a baseball lifetime ago, when he was a starter for Atlanta in April. He held New York scoreless into the fifth inning, then allowed six straight batters to reach — one on an error, one walk and four singles.\n7. Steven Matz © Provided by Sporting News Unbeaten in six starts in the regular season, Matz took his first loss as a major leaguer in Game 4 of the division series when he allowed three runs on six hits in five innings to the Dodgers. It was one bad inning that did in the 24-year-old left-hander, and that frame turned on a bloop hit by Adrian Gonzalez. Mostly, he looked like he belonged on the same mound as Clayton Kershaw, which was impressive.\nThe Cubs were 20-14 against lefty starters this year, a tick worse than they were against right-handers, percentage wise. Matz’s presence in the playoff rotation not only represents an advantage in that regard, he represents a change from the three righty fireballers the Mets have along with him, though Matz himself is also no soft-tosser.\n8. Fernando Rodney © Provided by Sporting News The 38-year-old former closer returned to the playoffs in Game 4 against the Cardinals, got two outs, issued one walk and did his trademark arrow-shooting mime celebration as he returned to the dugout. That might have seemed like a bit much, but if he is on, Rodney provides a nice safety net for Hector Rondon, who looked a little shaky in the division series after working a career-high 72 games in the regular season.\nRodney was terrible with the Mariners for most of the season, but allowed only eight hits and four walks in 12 innings down the stretch for the Cubs, with 15 strikeouts. He’s also one of the few Cubs with deep playoff experience, having gone to the 2006 World Series with the Tigers.\n9. Travis d'Arnaud © Provided by Sporting News The Mets catcher struggled in the division series, going 3 for 19 with a homer, though it’s hard to hold any hitting performance against anyone who faced Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw a combined four times.\nDuring a season limited by injuries, d’Arnaud hit .268/.340/.485 with 12 home runs in 67 games. If there is a silver lining to all of the time he missed, it is that d’Arnaud does not have the same wear and tear on his body from catching that someone like Buster Posey might, so a bounce-back from a rough division series may well be in the cards.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-14/nlds-2015-kyle-schwarber-home-run-budweiser-sign-wrigley-field-cubs-clinch", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657748-mkb-playoffs-2015-nlds-national-league-division-series-photos-cardinals-cubs-dodgers-mets", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658301-alcs-2015-blue-jays-royals-picks-predicitons-dates-schedule"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:18:37.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
