And particularly with managing both clubs. We'll wait and see, only the players can make me smile next week when we play them.\" \nBerahino tapped in on Saturday to ruin Allardyce's return after Pantilmon dropped a cross under pressure from the striker, with the Black Cats boss insisting his goalkeeper was fouled. \nDespite being pleased with their performance, Sunderland are still winless in the Barclays Premier League and Allardyce believes the players must take his ideas on board. \nHe said: \"Hopefully with my experience at managing at his level and knowing what it takes to get out of this position, there's only me to guide them and them to do it. I can only guide them, they're the ones who have to do it.\" \nBerahino scored his third goal of the season since vowing he would never play for the club again after they turned down four bids from Tottenham in the summer. \nIt helped Albion to move seven points clear of the relegation zone and keeper Boaz Myhill believes the 22-year-old has to repay boss Tony Pulis. \nHe said: \"I'd say Saido owes the manager a big debt, he has gone a long way to paying him back today. \n\"He is good young player and that's why big teams are interested in him. It's a learning curve for someone his age to have that attention and people from the outside will be looking and saying 'he should be doing this, he gets paid to play for a big team'. \"But footballers are human beings and not robots.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:17:06.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
