The matchup is the MIAA’s Television Game of the Week and is available on Cox Channel Kansas. \nThough Lindenwood’s three losses have been by at least 20 points, the Lions bring their fair share of concerns, Higgins said. \n“I think they have a very talented quarterback (Jesse Scroggins),” Higgins said. “They’ve got some skilled athletes, and they play fast on defense.” \nLindenwood linebacker Connor Harris leads the nation in tackles with 60. \nThe Lions will have their hands full trying to slow down Emporia State’s offense, which leads the conference in total offense (533.8 yards per game) and points scored (44 per game). \nESU quarterback Brent Wilson leads the MIAA with 1,377 yards and 14 touchdowns through the air. \nHornets receivers Mitchell Foote and Kavaski Ervin rank second and fourth in the conference in receptions. Foote has 22 receptions for 251 yards while Ervin has 20 for 268 yards. \nEmporia State didn’t miss a beat last week in its first game without injured receiver Justin Brown. \nReceivers Morris Williams II and Anthony Buffalomeat stepped up in Brown’s absence. Williams had four catches for 147 yards and two touchdowns in a 55-14 win against Northeastern State, while Buffalomeat recorded his first career touchdown reception. \n“We knew there we’re going to be some guys who would get their opportunity, and it was good to see those players make the best of that,” Higgins said.
