Matt Ferner National Reporter, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/12/2015 06:27 PM EDT \nThe Cincinnati Bengals are now 5-0, thanks to placekicker Mike Nugent's overtime field goal that banked off the goal post's left upright, giving the team an improbable win over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. \nBut luck had nothing to do with it, America's favorite astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, said on Twitter. It was science -- the Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of the Earth. \nBecause the playing field at Paul Brown Stadium, home to the Bengals, is more-or-less oriented north and south, the earth's rotational effect deflected the the ball to the right, according to Tyson. Obviously. \nHere's Tyson explaining: Today's @Bengals winning OT field goal was likely enabled by a 1/3-in deflection to the right, caused by Earth’s Rotation. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 11, 2015 In the N. Hemisphere, Earth’s Coriolis force deflects airborne north-south projectiles to the right. About 1/2-in per 50 yds. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 11, 2015 The @Bengals stadium isn’t oriented exactly North-South. And the field goal was 42-yds. Yielding a 1/3-in deflection, not 1/2 — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 11, 2015 \nMind.
