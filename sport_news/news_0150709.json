Williams is under contract for 2016; his option was picked up in spring training. \nThe Nationals’ season ends on Sunday and Williams’s future with the team seems to be in doubt. High-level Nationals officials have been frustrated with the season, including Williams’s performance. General Manager Mike Rizzo has been using a variation of the same line about Williams in recent weeks : “We’ll make 2016 decisions after we finish 2015. He’s under contract to be the manager next year.” \nWilliams has declined to provide a specific rebuttal to the Post’s series or other claims he has “lost” the clubhouse. He briefly addressed the accounts earlier in the week, saying that the full facts were needed and that it wasn’t the right venue to detail his side. Asked Saturday why he didn’t want to offer a more thorough account, Williams said: \n“I personally feel that it is my job to be a calming force as opposed to a disruptive one. We have a lot of talented players on this team that I support wholeheartedly every single day. I will not stop doing that. Ever. Believe me when I tell you this: ever stop doing that. That being said, I’m not going to subject this team to any further distraction. There’s no reason for further distraction at this point. What’s important is that we finish this season as strong as we can finish. Beyond that, it’s noise.” \nWilliams declined to say if he was expecting to have any conversations with the Lerner family, the team’s owners. \n“There’s conversations that happen every single day,” he said. “We’ll keep that private to this point. We’ve got three to play and we’ve got a potential MVP on our team, and this is not gonna be a distraction anymore. It’s not. Bryce [Harper] needs to play, our guys need to finish strong. [Max Scherzer is] gonna pitch again, can end his season strong. So can Gio [Gonzalez]. So can Tanner [Roark]. That’s what we’re concerned about. To throw anything else out there is just not prudent. That’s not what we wanna do at this point.” James Wagner joined the Post in August 2010 and, prior to covering the Nationals, covered high school sports across the region. sports Success!
