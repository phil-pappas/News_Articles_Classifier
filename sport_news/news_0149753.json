And he's playing like a man. Doing what he's doing is pretty special.\" \nGame 3 against the Blue Jays is tonight in Texas, a game that will start about the same time the Dallas Cowboys should be finishing their home game across the street against the Patriots. \nLeft-hander Martin Perez (3-6) pitches for the Rangers in the potential clincher. Marco Estrada (13-8), who held hitters to a MLB-low .183 batting average after the All-Star break, starts for Toronto. \n\"We need a big outburst with the bats, score a lot of runs,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \"We score in bunches. That's kind of our trademark. ... Hopefully we can do it one time, you know, catch our breath a little bit and gain a little confidence, maybe we can hang in this thing.\" \nTEPERA FOR CECIL: Blue Jays reliever Brett Cecil's season is over because of a torn calf muscle, and the left-hander was replaced on Toronto's roster by rookie right-hander Ryan Tepera. \n\"It's not the way I perceived it ending,\" Cecil said Saturday, a day after sustaining the injury in Game 2 of the AL Division Series. \nHe got hurt while tagging out Mike Napoli in a rundown than ended the eighth inning of the Blue Jays' 6-4 loss in 14 innings to Texas on Friday. \nTepera had a 3.27 ERA in 32 appearances this season. \nBELTRE DAY TO DAY: Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre, who exited Game 1 early with lower back stiffness. is still considered day to day. He was excused from Saturday's workout to stay home and rest, and will be reevaluated before the game tonight. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:23:22.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
