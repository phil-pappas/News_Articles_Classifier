(AP) - Firefighting foam used to fight oil train spills and fires is being deployed to 19 cities across New York state.\nThe foam concentrate is stored in trailers along with equipment needed to apply the foam to an oil spill. The foam forms a blanket over oil spills and contains fires.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo says the trailers are being placed in cities along the north-south and east-west routes of oil trains that cross the state, from Buffalo to Albany and Plattsburgh to Rockland County.\nThe state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services is placing the trailers near major population centers along rail lines and waterways. The trailers will be deployed by early 2016.\nLocal fire departments will be trained to use the equipment.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:09:43.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
