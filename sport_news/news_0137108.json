Championship Series -- and into the record book. \nJorge Soler, Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber connected as the Cubs set a postseason mark with six home runs in beating the St. Louis Cardinals 8-6 Monday for a 2-1 lead in the N.L. Division Series. \n\"To see the ball fly out of the yard as many times as it did was incredible,\" Arrieta said. \nThe Cubs held a share of the previous postseason homer record, hitting five in Game 1 of the 1984 NLCS against San Diego. \n\"Pretty impressive,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"You know, I know the wind was blowing out -- we'll concede that -- but most of them were properly struck. We are definitely capable of that.\" \nA third straight win for the Cubs on Tuesday afternoon, and the once woebegone franchise will advance to the NLCS for the first time in 12 years. The Cardinals, who led the majors with 100 wins this season, have won at least one playoff series in each of the last four years. \nJason Heyward and Stephen Piscotty homered for St. Louis, which got to Arrieta for four runs in his worst start in four months. But the Cardinals were unable to keep the Cubs in the ballpark. Advertisement \nArrieta improved to 18-1 with a 1.00 ERA in his last 22 starts dating to June 21, but he was far from his usual dominant self. He hadn't allowed more than three runs in a game since a June 16 loss to Cleveland. \nAnd it didn't matter, not one bit. \n\"Today we got his back -- just like he always got our backs,\" second baseman Starlin Castro said. \nSchwarber, Castro and Bryant homered against Michael Wacha. Soler, Anthony Rizzo and Dexter Fowler hit the other home runs for the Cubs. Mets 13, Dodgers 7: Curtis Granderson drove in five runs with two doubles off the wall, Travis d'Arnaud and Yoenis Cespedes homered, and New York's bats busted loose for a victory over Los Angeles and a 2-1 lead in their N.L. Division Series. Before a bloodthirsty crowd of 44,276 in the first postseason game at Citi Field, the Mets broke their postseason scoring record as New York public enemy Chase Utley watched from the Los Angeles bench. \nThe N.L. East champs quickly erased an early three-run deficit and made a winner of a mediocre Matt Harvey in his playoff debut. Harvey labored through five innings in his first outing since missing a mandatory postseason workout and apologizing after he arrived. \nGranderson's five RBIs matched a Mets postseason record set by Carlos Delgado in Game 4 of the 2006 NLCS at St. Louis, when New York set its previous postseason high with 12 runs. Royals 9, Astros 6: Almost out of time and out of the playoffs, defending A.L. champion Kansas City saved its season. The Royals took advantage when Astros shortstop Carlos Correa couldn't handle a deflected grounder that might have been a double-play ball, rallying for five runs in the eighth inning to beat Houston and force their playoff series to a decisive Game 5. \"We always feel that we're still in games, and we still have a chance,\" first baseman Eric Hosmer said. \"That's the mentality for this whole entire team. It's never quit, and the character we showed today. That's what a championship ballclub does.\" \nCorrea homered twice, doubled, singled and drove in four runs. Houston took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but a tough error charged to the 21-year-old rookie keyed the Royals' comeback to even the matchup at two games apiece. \n\"I missed it. That's what happened,\" Correa said. \"I wish I was perfect. I wish I could do everything perfect, but I'm not. I'm human.\" \nGame 5 will be back in Kansas City on Wednesday night. Johnny Cueto is set to start for the Royals against Collin McHugh. Blue Jays 8, Rangers 4: Toronto went deep early and used a pair of Cy Young winners to force a deciding Game 5 in the A.L. Division Series. Josh Donaldson and Chris Colabello hit home runs before 40-year-old knuckleballer R.A. Dickey threw his first postseason pitch, and the Blue Jays won Game 4 to send the series back to Toronto. \nDickey, the 2012 N.L. Cy Young winner, allowed one run over 4ï»¿2/3 innings and was pulled with a 7-1 lead and a runner on base. Then 2012 A.L. Cy Young winner David Price took over and pitched three innings, getting the win after losing in the opener.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:32:40.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
