But with Jim Harbaugh gone from San Francisco and the Seahawks reeling to start the year, there is a new feeling going into this game on Thursday night - the feeling that the loser of this game might be out of the playoff race.Both teams are 2-4 and looking up at the two other teams in the NFC West. This is not totally surprising for San Francisco - the Niners lost most of their defensive stars this offseason, and seem to be rebuilding much of that unit under first year head coach Jim Tomsula. But this is totally out of character for the reigning NFC Champions. The Seahawks have not had a healthy Marshawn Lynch for most of the season, but more striking has been the team's inability to secure leads in the fourth quarter, especially at home.They're on the road Thursday night though, and Russell Wilson and the rest of 'Hawks know, their slow start has to end this week, if they want to make their third straight Super Bowl.Kickoff in Santa Clara is 8:25pm, and you can watch the game on CBS12.
