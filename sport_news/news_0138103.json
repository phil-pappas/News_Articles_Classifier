(Jim MIddlekauff | lehighvalleylive.com contributor) By Brad Wilson | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 08, 2015 8:00 AM, updated October 08, 2015 2:36 PM View/Post Comments \nBelvidere’s football schedule should get flipped around. \nIn an ideal world, football teams would play their biggest, toughest games at the end of the season when much would be at stake and the teams would be tested and ready for the challenge. \nEarly-season games don’t seem like the appropriate place for critical contests. Michigan-Ohio State in 80-degree weather? Easton-Phillipsburg on Labor Day, not Thanksgiving? Lafayette-Lehigh in week 1? \nBut that’s what the County Seaters’ Mid-State 38 Valley Division slate offers. \n“I think you come out in week one and week two and you don’t really know what to expect from your team,” Belvidere junior quarterback Jake Thornton said. “Since Belvidere has our biggest games (David Brearley and New Providence) in week one and two, we feel like we didn’t know what we had and we had two losses. But last year we lost to Brearley in our first game and then we won the rest of our games. This year we lost to New Providence too but then we’ve started to execute better. I wish we played Brearley later in the season, but last year we lost to them, and then beat them in the (North 2 Group 1 playoffs). We’d like to play them again in November this year.” Jake Thornton. ((Jim Middlekauff | lehighvalleylive.com contributor)) \nBut that extra loss to New Providence means that the Seaters’ margin for error this season is small, and makes Friday night’s visit (7) from Roselle Park (2-1) a must-win for Belvidere (2-2) which rebounded from its opening defeats with resounding defeats of South Hunterdon and Dayton. \n“We’re tied with Roselle Park in power points,” Belvidere coach Josh Costantino said. “Brearley and New Providence are atop the league, us and Roselle Park are the next two. This is a game we have to win.” \nAnd it follows that, for a victory to occur, this will be a game Thornton will have to excel in. \nThe 6-foot, 180-pound junior has become a true master of Belvidere’s veer offense, which requires a quarterback to be able to run, handle option plays and be effective with fakes and slight of hand in an offense that can be deadly with misdirection. Thornton had some experience as a sophomore but has come a long way since then. \n“I think Jake has picked up the offense and he’s showing how good he can be,” Costantino said. “The game reps absolutely have made the difference. There’s no way we can give him the same looks at practice. Once he found his speed, the offense has taken off the last two weeks.” \nLike a rocket, in fact. \nBelvidere has scored 80 points in its last two games versus 33 in first two. On the season, Thornton leads the County Seaters in rushing touchdowns with six and has carried the ball 30 times for 256 yards (8.6 yards per carry). Belvidere will not be confused with an aerial circus any time soon, but Thornton is an efficient passer, completing 15 of 23 passes for 205 yards, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. \nThornton modestly passes on credit for his accomplishments. \n“Most of it comes from my coaches,” he said. “My coaches have worked really hard to help me improve, and my entire team has improved around me.” \nThornton agreed that game experience has made an enormous difference. \n“Playing in games is the only way I can get better,” he said. “I think I have gotten better at picking up what each defense is going to do. I learn every time I come off the field from our offensive coaches about what to do when we get this look or that look. I am getting better at picking up the little things defenses do and take what the defense gives me.” \nIt doesn’t hurt Thornton’s progress that he is, according to Costantino, perhaps the best athlete in the school. \nBut there’s more to Thornton’s improvement than just physical matters. Senior captain Bailey Castner , who lines up behind Thornton has a halfback, sees a very different Jake Thornton than last fall’s version. \n“He has really matured,” Castner said. “He’s so calm when he comes in the huddle. He knows what he is doing. He’s not rushing the plays. And he’s gotten a lot more confident.” \nThornton said leadership was an area he needed to work on. \n“I was not verbal enough as a junior,” he said. “This year I am talking to my teammates a lot more. I feel more in control and confident in the offense. I feel like whole different person, in a way I can’t explain, when I am on the field this year.” \nIt all adds up to a quarterback, and a team, on the move. \n“We have a lot of faith in Jake,” Costantino said. \nFaith that may yet carry Belvidere to the postseason – even after such a backward start.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:10:05.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
