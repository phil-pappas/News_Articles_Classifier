We’re like a big group of friends, which is great.” The Cougars made sure the pregame celebration held for the school’s seniors wasn’t for naught, charging out of the gate with 20 unanswered points en route to a 49-16 victory over Sacred Heart. “The fact of the matter is, you only get one homecoming,” said co-head coach Matt Trahan. “We told the seniors, ‘Enjoy the moment,’ and they did.” “It’s a special day,” added co-head coach Brandon Mendez. “It’s one of those days they will always remember. It was their day, and they took advantage of it.” Seniors Cameron Pierce and Andrew Maurer each had a huge game for the Cougars, with Pierce running for three touchdowns and Maurer hauling in six grabs for 187 yards and three touchdowns himself. Junior Jack Murphy helped the seniors celebrate, as he completed 13-of-17 passes for 275 yards and three touchdowns, all to Maurer. “Jack worked hard this week. He met the challenge.” said Mendez, while also commending the play of his offensive line. “We made some adjustments along the offensive line — we definitely want to point those guys out...we can’t say enough about them. They worked hard all week.” After just one score in the first quarter, a huge second helped the Cougars beat up on a Sacred Heart squad that is winless in its first year as a varsity program. Early in the second, Murphy hit Maurer on a 50-yard bomb that set up Pierce’s second touchdown, a 5-yard run up the middle that made it 14-0. After the defense recovered a botched lateral pass from Saints quarterback Nick Weir, Murphy hit Maurer on another big pass, this one for 40 yards, making it 20-0 with 6:12 left in the half. The Saints answered back with a score of their own on a 53-yard touchdown pass from Weir to Steve Fehrm, but on the Cougar’s next play from scrimmage, Murphy again hit Maurer, who beat double coverage down the right sideline for a 60-yard score, making it 26-8. Maurer hauled in his third TD of the quarter on a nine-yard quick hitter to the left, beating several defenders before diving into the end zone with only 24 second remaining in the half. Pierce added his third score on a 24-yard run right up the middle of Sacred Heart’s defense in the third quarter, with Connor Davis making an outstanding diving catch on a two-point conversion to make the score 42-8. “Cam Pierce is a monster,” said Mendez of the 5-foot-10, 210-pound back. Cavarello added a 15-yard score on a toss sweep to the left that made it 49-8 late in the fourth. Sacred Heart’s Jimmy O’Brian was able to rip off a 40-yard run with 9:28 left to finish the scoring. LET’S BE FRANK-LIN: Both Trahan and Mendez praised the job defensive coach Gil Franklin did getting his players prepared for the game. The defense forced four turnovers, including interceptions by Sumner Blackburn and Troy Hougasian in OC’s big second quarter. “(He) gets those guys ready to roll every week,” said Mendez. “There’s nobody better at getting kids ready to play. You watch this guy in practice, it’s like a clinic. Every week. Four turnovers, that’s good stuff. That’s kids playing out their rolls and doing what they were taught to do.” PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT: “We really had a good week this week,” said Trahan. “They had a good four or five days. To put things together the way that we did this week makes all the difference in the world.” ON 6-FOOT-4, 255 POUND OL/DL JAKE MURPHY: “He came to play,” said Trahan. “Every week, he gets a little bit better. He’s like a fine wine.”…“I don’t know if there’s anybody that works harder than that kid,” added Mendez. “We run a mile every day, and he’s the first one in the mile.” Trahan said he even runs 5Ks in the offseason. “Believe it or not, he does. He’s bought in.” LIGHTING IT UP: Oliveira Field, which doesn’t have permanent lights, will play host to Old Colony’s matchup next Saturday night at 6 p.m. against West Bridgewater. “They’re rolling out the lights here,” said Trahan. “They’re a heavy hitter year-in, year-out. But I like our chances. The way we played today, we hope we can roll it into next week. Everybody in town should be here.” ADDED INSPIRATION: “Our coach told us that they thought they were going to come in and give it to us,” said Cavarello. “It got us a little extra fired up. We kept it all out there. They got a little chippy. We just showed em on the field.” Old Colony 49, Sacred Heart 16 Sacred Heart;0;8;0;8 — 16", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:20:49.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
