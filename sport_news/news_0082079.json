His putt gave him and Korean-born Danny Lee a 1-up victory over Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker. \nThe International team won three matches and halved another, cutting the American lead to 5.5-4.5 going into eight matches Saturday. \nThe halved match was the most peculiar at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea on Friday. Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson were assessed a one-hole penalty at No. 7 when Mickelson used a different model golf ball, ultimately costing the Americans the match. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:25:26.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
