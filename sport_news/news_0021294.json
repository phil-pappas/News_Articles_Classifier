In the huddle between regulation and OT, Panizza told his teammates, \"It doesn't matter if we're a man down. We have more heart.\" \nThe Rams showed it, as junior midfielder Michael Lauria kept playing the ball despite losing a shoe â€” setting Panizza up for the winning goal. Panizza's low shot from the left side hit the woodwork at the bottom of the goal and ricocheted back, but it had already crossed the line. \nRandolph's bench cleared, celebrating a 2-1 overtime defeat of Mount Olive in the MCT semi.
