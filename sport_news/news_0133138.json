Rizzo launched his second home run in as many nights off Cardinals lefty reliever Kevin Siegrist, deep into the right-field bleachers. Your browser does not support iframes. \nOne inning later, rookie Kyle Schwarber launched a home run that may be talked about forever in this city. \nSchwarber hit the ball so hard that it carried the bleachers and landed atop the right-field scoreboard, sending the party into full force. He is the first Cubs player to reach the scoreboard, which was installed this summer. The Cubs' Kyle Schwarber just hit a baseball to the moon \nYet, it was Rizzo who was perhaps was most responsible for the Cubs’ offensive show. He started the second-inning attack simply by using his head. Rizzo, seeing third base vacated while the Cardinals moved into a shift to the right side, beat it by merely pounding the ball into the ground on the left side. A routine chopper turned into a critical leadoff single. \nStarlin Castro grounded out, but Schwarber followed with a single, brining Miguel Montero to the plate, and sending Cubs manager Joe Maddon’s mind spinning. \nIt was the moment Maddon let everyone know that he was treating this game like a do-or-die, wanting no part of trying to beat the Cardinals in Game 5 at Busch Stadium. He called the bullpen, and ordered Justin Grimm to warm up, knowing he might need a pinch-hitter for Hammel, who stood in the on-deck circle. \nMontero struck out, Grimm sat down, and it looked like Maddon’s decision to bat Hammel eighth and not ninth was about to blow up in his face. \nOnly, these are the new Cubs, with a manager that has had the golden touch all season. \nSo, of course, Hammel singles up the middle, scoring Castro, and cutting the Cardinals’ lead to 2-1. \nShortstop Javier Baez, in the starting lineup only because Addison Russell strained his hamstring Monday night, swung mightily on the first pitch he saw. \nAnd drove John Lackey’s hanging breaking ball into the right-field bleachers. \nThree-run homer. \nWrigley Field absolutely erupted. \nThe Cubs had a 4-2 lead, and Maddon made sure it was going to stick, yanking Hammel out of the game after just three innings, and turning the final 18 outs to his bullpen. \nThe Cardinals, after winning 100 games, are now done for the season, their earliest departure since 2010. \nThe Cardinals had been in the National League Championship Series the last four years, winning two pennants and a World Series, but it was the Cubs who finally ended the Cardinals’ reign. \nThis is a franchise that has won 11 World Series titles, and hosted 140 postseason games, but no more games will be played this year at Busch Stadium. \nNow, it’s the Cubs who have visions of the World Series dancing in their sleep, with tickets going for an average of $6,750, $6,754 and $8,443 for their three potential games, according to Bloomberg. \nSo imagine just how high they might go if the Cubs actually get there, and win the NLCS. \nYes, it’s crazy in Chicago, with the city falling back in love with a team that won 24 more games than a year ago, playing with four rookies in the starting lineup. \nAnd a manager who had them believing anything was possible. \n“He creates the perfect environment for players to be themselves and perform at the highest level,’’ Cubs president Theo Epstein said, “while having fun. \n“We would not be here without Joe at this moment in time.’’ \nThis is what the Cubs’ management envisioned all along, only, not this year. \nThis was supposed to happen next year. \nThese Cubs refused to wait. \n“I think,’’ Maddon said, “the whole city is ready for this.’’ \nYou think? \nIt started back in spring training when Rizzo reminded everyone of his prediction they would win the division, Maddon predicted 90 victories and a postseason berth, and catcher Miguel Montero had T-shirts made that read: #Wearegood.’’ \n“I just want to send a message to our team, pretty much,’’ Montero said. “I want to let them know what I feel about our team, and what I believe about every single guy in our clubhouse. Then, if we don’t believe that we are good or not, we’re going to have a chance. \n“So we have to believe it to actually accomplish the goal.’’ \nWell, the Cubs have got the whole city believing that nothing can stop them now. \n“We feel great about our chances,\" Castro said. \"I've been through lot of bad moments here, but now we have found a way to be a winning team.\" \nOh, have they ever.
