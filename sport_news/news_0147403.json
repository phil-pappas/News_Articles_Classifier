Related Report: Sharks' Torres suspended for hit \nWilliams' firing was expected as the Nationals, with a team-record $164-million payroll finished with an 83-79 record and failed to reach the playoffs. \nWilliams, who took over two seasons ago, had one year left on his contract. This was his first job as a manager. \nWilliams won 96 games in 2014 in his first season as manager and was named National League Manager of the Year. The Nationals lost in the NLDS to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants. \nThe Nationals hired Williams, according to The Washington Post, because of his track record as a player, his organizational and communication skills, and because of their belief that a young manager could grow alongside the team.
