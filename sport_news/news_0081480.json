Kyrgios then saved three match points in the third set before Nishikori finally closed it out. \nKyrgios was fined $1,500 for an \"audible obscenity\" in his first-round match in Shanghai. He faces suspension from the ATP tour if he reaches $5,000 in fines before February. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:12:07.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
