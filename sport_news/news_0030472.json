The Eagles are sending six lines to the event. ( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nWith most of its team comprised of sophomores, the future is very bright for the Thompson Valley tennis team. It's easy to look ahead and see the Eagles becoming one of the better teams in the entire state in a couple years. \nHowever, in many ways the future is now for coach Jay Klagge's team, which is sending six of its seven lines to the 4A state tournament this week, the most in team history. \nAll three of the squad's singles players — Tony Klagge (No. 1), Adam Brubaker (2) and Alex Southard (3) — along with three of its four doubles teams — Landon Lees/Jake Madden (1), Haakon Irey/David Hartman (2) and Baily Hamrick/Brandon Hamrick (3) — will be making the trip to Pueblo for first round matches Thursday morning. \nThe team nearly qualified all seven positions, with each making it to the regional finals last week in Greeley, but the No. 4 duo of Aeneas DeLuca and Jonathan Szwaja came up just short after losing a three-set tiebreaker in the regional championship match before falling in a playback to Greeley Central. \nDeLuca and Szwaja were actually one of the better bets to make it to state after a stellar regular season, proving there are no guarantees when it comes to regionals. \nThe state tournament culminates a season in which the Eagles went 9-2 in duals, with TVHS shutting out its opponent in all but two of those wins. It'll be a much different story this week, tough, especially since all six of the team's positions qualified as a regional runner-up, which ensures a tough draw in the bracket. Advertisement \nFacing such top-notch competition, though, is exactly what Coach Klagge thinks his team needs. \n\"We'll get to see what really good tennis looks like,\" Klagge said. \"That's the great thing about sending six lines, is they'll go down there and get their eyes opened. And we're young, so we'll see what the best tennis in the state looks like, and hopefully our kids will decide that's where they want to get to.\" Thompson Valley is sending all three singles players to state, including Adam Brubaker at the No. 2 spot. ( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nThree of the nine players who qualified are making their second straight trip to the state tournament, including Tony Klagge, who found out last year as a freshman how much better the competition is at state compared to the rest of the season. \n\"I learned that once you get to state, there are no easy opponents really,\" the sophomore said. \"You get there and it's all teams that are good. They all either won or got second in their regional tournament, so there aren't really any bad players there, so you have to play well every single match. To win you have to play your very best tennis every time you step on the court.\" \nAlthough the Eagles have realistic expectations for the tournament, they also know that with six lines competing, they can definitely make some noise in the team standings. \n\"Of course we're not going for a state title or anything, that's pretty much up to Kent Denver and maybe Niwot and Cheyenne Mountain. But, I think we can score more points than we did last year and more points that we have in a while,\" Tony Klagge said. \"Hopefully this will be the best showing we've had at state in the last five or 10 years.\" \nPueblo might not be the ideal location for a lot of teams around the state, but the Eagles are actually embracing that aspect of the tournament. Missing a couple days of school isn't something to complain about, and neither is getting to bunk up with your teammates for a few nights. \n\"I'm actually really happy it's down in Pueblo because we'll just have more fun as a team just hanging out together in the hotel rooms and stuff. It's almost nice having it as a little vacation,\" Irey said. \n\"This is just gonna be so much fun. We achieved our goal. Our goal was just to be the best we could be, but we did much more than that this year considering probably 80 percent of the team is sophomores.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:04:12.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
