Fattal's 24-yard touchdown pass to Corey Mort with 35 seconds remaining helped Corunna rally to a 35-28 win over Lake Fenton on Friday and earn a share of the GAC Red title. \nCorunna is one of 10 mid-Michigan teams ranked in the top 10 of their division or receiving votes heading into the final week of the regular season. \nIthaca remained No. 1 in Division 6 and Portland is still No. 2 in Division 5 to lead all ranked area teams. \nDeWitt and Lakewood, which both fell from the ranks of the unbeatens Friday, dropped several spots this week. DeWitt fell six spots to No. 10 in Division 3, while Lakewood dropped five places to No. 7 in Division 4. \nThe other area ranked teams are Grand Ledge (No. 7 in Division 1), Lansing Catholic (No. 5 in Division 5), Pewamo-Westphalia (No. 4 in Division 7) and Fowler (No. 9 in Division 8). \nMorrice is receiving votes just outside the top five in the 8-man division. \nContact Brian Calloway at bcalloway@lsj.com.
