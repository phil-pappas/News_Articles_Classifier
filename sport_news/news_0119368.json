NEW YORK – It wasn’t just that the Rangers won, though that, of course, was important.\nIt was the way the Rangers beat the Sharks, 4-0, on Monday night at Madison Square Garden to snap a three-game losing streak. Their most complete 60-minute effort of the young season was highlighted by backup goalie Antti Raanta pitching a 22-save shutout in his Rangers debut.\n“For us, it’s a good example of what happens when we play with our structure,” captain Ryan McDonagh said.\nThat largely had been missing as the Rangers (4-2-1) put together three lackluster performances with limited offensive opportunities generating just two goals in that span.\n“Good teams don’t let these things slide,” said Rick Nash, who, though he remains without a goal, easily had his best game of the season with four shots and a power-play assist in 15:39. “We were urgent to turn this around.\nNash joined, among others, Chris Kreider (three shots, one assist in 16:51) and defenseman Marc Staal (goal and an assist in 18:10) in having their best games.\nThere was four-line balance – a rarity this season – a focused effort on forechecking and screening opposing goalie Martin Jones, who stopped 24 shots for the Sharks (4-2-0) after entering the game with a 4-0-0 record and a 0.49 goals-against average.\n“Our guys defended so well today,” said Raanta, who now has four career shutouts. “We haven’t been doing that, what we did the whole game today.”\n\nThe Rangers’ special teams were very good with both a key power-play goal – a rarity this season, too – and a 5-on-3 penalty kill.\nAnd the Rangers defensemen were very active in creating quick breakouts and rushes.\n“We weren’t good enough the first bunch of games,” said Staal, whose shot through traffic from the left point to make it 1-0 at 10:36 of the first period marked just the second goal for a Rangers’ blue-liner this season. “I thought we were better tonight getting pucks toward the net and making plays. It gave us some success and momentum.”\nThe defensemen’s importance in sparking the offense was best evidenced on Jesper Fast’s breakaway to make it 3-0 at 3:47 of the third period.\nDefenseman Keith Yandle, with his fourth assist of the season, sprung Kreider out of the Rangers’ zone and Kreider got it to Fast, who beat defenseman Brenden Dillon to the crease. Bing-bam-boom, the Rangers were able to effectively use their team speed.\nThat was something woefully absent in Sunday afternoon’s 2-1 overtime loss to the previously-winless Devils.\n“This is a step in the right direction,” said Kreider, who had three shots and an assist in 16:51 and, like Nash, hit the post in the third period.\n“We had better looks offensively,” coach Alain Vigneault added. “Moving forward here, we’ll be all right.”\nThe turning point came early in the second period when the Sharks had 22 seconds of a 5-on-3 power play but could not generate a shot, though Raanta prevented a scoring chance but kicking away a wide-open Joe Thornton’s crossing feed from the right post.\nThe Rangers then held the Sharks to one shot on the ensuing 5-on-4.\nThat turned into a 2-0 lead on Mats Zuccarello’s power-play goal from the right circle through Nash’s screen at 9:28 of the second period. It was just the Rangers’ second man-advantage goal this season in 17 chances.\n“We lost pretty much ever facet of the game,” Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said. “Lost races to the puck, lost battles, lost the special teams’ battle. There’s a price to pay to win and the other team was more willing to pay that price tonight.”\nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:24:23.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
