(AP Photo/ Richard Shiro) × \nCHESTNUT HILL, Mass. – When the schedule came out, this looked like an interesting matchup for Clemson. It still is, just for a different reason. \nWhen Clemson was still in fall camp, it appeared Louisville, Notre Dame and Georgia Tech would be in full force giving the Tigers everything they’ve got – and there’d be Boston College at the end of the first half of this season to force Clemson into a rockfight. \nWell, Louisville and Georgia Tech weren’t exactly up to snuff at the time they faced Clemson, and Boston College, while wielding a wicked defense, can’t muster much of anything on offense. #GoACC. \nTo explain what’s going on these days in the ACC’s northeasternmost member, we invite the Boston Globe’s Michael Vega to break down Boston College. Give Mike a follow here on Twitter , if you’d be so kind. \nAaron Brenner, The Post and Courier: Let ’ s start by revisiting what was one of Clemson ’ s closer calls among its 10 victories last year. What was the mood like around the Eagles after their narrow loss at home to the Tigers last October? \nMichael Vega, Boston Globe : Well, the mood wasn’t as funeral as it was frustrating for the Eagles, who knew, to a man, they let a big one slip off the hook. It was a harbinger of things to come that season for BC, which suffered late-game letdowns against Colorado State, at Florida State, in their loss (in overtime) to Penn State in the Pinstripe Bowl in New York. Several of those setbacks were due to the fact that BC was unable to convert on eight -- count ‘em, eight! -- PATs last season. The same kicking issue has seemingly reared its (ugly) head again this season, evidenced by missed field goals at Duke and last week vs. Wake Forest that would have resulted in victories that improved BC’s record to 5-1. Ah, but we digress. The Eagles were in no mood to claim any moral victories by putting a scare into Clemson. \nBrenner: Certainly, it ’ s been a struggle for the offense. Is it simply not being able to replace playmakers like Chase Rettig, Andre Williams and Tyler Murphy, or are there more factors at play such as a completely new offensive line? \nVega : Third-year coach Steve Addazio knew his team was going to be young and inexperienced to begin with, having to break in a new quarterback and a new offensive line (after losing all five starters from last year’s squad). But what he never predicted was how much more young and inexperienced -- and, worse yet, ineffective -- BC’s offense would become after being decimated by injuries to its starting tight ends, season-ending injuries to sophomore QB Darius Wade and sophomore RB Jon Hilliman, starting center Frank Taylor, and kicker Alex Howell, who has been relegated to punting duties because of a strained right quad. Although BC, as Addazio is quick to point out, ranks No. 9 in the country in time of possession (32:38) and No. 25 in rushing (214.0 ypg), the Eagles’ ability to move and control the football has been undermined by their inability to score the football, producing just one touchdown in their last 12 quarters of conference play. \nBrenner: The No. 1 defense in the land is something to crow about - even with the Maine and Howard games removed, the Eagles ’ stats are still stingy. What makes that unit one of the finest in the country, and is it sustainable into the second half of the season? \nVega : The travesty of BC’s first half of the season is that the Eagles’ have wasted a championship-caliber effort from their defense, ranked No. 1 in the nation in five different statistical categories (total defense, rushing defense, first downs, passing yards allowed, team passing efficiency defense). In last week’s 3-0 loss to Wake Forest, the defense handed the offense a golden scoring opportunity -- on a silver platter, no less -- when it recovered a fumble at the Wake 11, only to watch as the Eagles came up a yard shy of the end zone as time expired. One wonders what more can the defense do? And how much can it withstand having to play with such a miniscule margin for error? BC’s defensive strength has been its ability to generate a four-man pass rush from its salty and battle-scarred veterans along the defensive line, including ends Mehdi Abdesmad and Kevin Kavalec and tackles Connor Wujciak and Truman Gutapfel. Then there’s sophomore linebackers Ty Schwab and Connor Strachan, both of whom possess the athletic ability to play in space, and senior linebacker Steven Daniels, the resident thumper of BC’s front seven. The back end is much improved as well, evidenced by the play of safeties Justin Simmons and John Johnson. Corners Kamrin Moore and Isaac Yiadom have given the Eagles stout press-man coverage and have seldom allowed themselves to get beat deep by an opposing wideout. \nBrenner: How high are the expectations for Steve Addazio these days? Personal favorite of this beat writer, Addazio is, but does it feel like the program is going somewhere under his leadership? \nVega : The job Steve Addazio did in his first two seasons at BC was nothing short of miraculous with back-to-back 7-6 bowl seasons. But early on Addazio tried to temper any enthusiasm about what his third year might bring because he knew the Eagles would face some severe limitations, offensively. He was able to cover some of them up his first two seasons with the addition of graduate transfers on the offensive line and at quarterback, but now he is being forced to fertilize his young and inexperienced players all while weathering the storm of a season wrought with injuries to key offensive personnel. But Addazio knows these are merely pangs of growth for his up-and-coming program, which he has infused with his boundless energy and enthusiasm and toughness. It is true that BC’s football players reflect their coach. In time, he will get the job done. \nBrenner: What constitutes a successful Saturday at Memorial Stadium for Boston College? \nVega : Quite simply, BC’s defense will need to play both ways. Seriously, BC not only has to possess the football, but the Eagles have to score the football. If BC can even muster a field goal or get a big return for a score from its special teams, it just might be the spark BC’s defense needs to make any lead stand up. But BC’s D will be supremely challenged by Clemson’s vast array of offensive playmakers, led by QB Deshaun Watson.
