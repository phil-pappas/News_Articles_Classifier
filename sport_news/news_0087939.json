NEW YORK — With a division banner hanging in the upper deck in right field, Mets players and staff did a lap around the field Sunday afternoon following their final regular-season game of the 2015 season.\nIn a season full of highs and lows, the team overcame its early offensive struggles and rode its stellar starting pitching to its first NL East title since 2006.\nAs David Wright thanked the crowd of 41,631 for their support this season, he let them know the team already has set its sights on the opening game of the NLDS.\nSaid Wright: “Let’s go beat L.A.!”\nThe Mets had just defeated the Nationals, 1-0, at Citi Field. Curtis Granderson hit a game-winning homer in the eighth, and closer Jeurys Familia tied the team’s single-season record with his 43rd save in securing the first 90-win season since 2006.\nThe Mets (90-72) will start Jacob deGrom in Game 1 of the NLDS on Friday in Los Angeles.\n“This team believed early on. Spring training, a lot of guys said we were a playoff team and some chuckles, and people thinking it’s just talking heads,” Wright said. “It’s nice to go out there and back up that thought we had in spring training.”\nThe Mets’ season began in Washington, D.C., against these same Nationals with a series win, and it ended in New York with a victory over the team they beat out for the title. The Amazin’s were perceived as a possible contender entering the season, but key trade acquisitions helped push them over the top.\nWith Sunday’s game having no bearing on the playoffs, it instead served as a final tuneup, and it went according to plan.\nDeGrom completed his sophomore season by throwing four no-hit innings on 72 pitches. He will square off against either Clayton Kershaw or Zack Greinke on Friday night. One season after winning Rookie of the Year, deGrom posted the best season of any Mets starter, going 14-8 with a 2.54 ERA.\n“I feel ready. I knew today was a tuneup and I worked on a few things. Today was a big step for me,” deGrom said. “I’m going to try to prepare [Friday] like I do for any start. I’m going to try to not think too much about it and just try to keep us in a position to win.”\nNew York’s pitching carried the team this season, and that unit shone Sunday. DeGrom and six relievers combined to allow just two hits, and they carried a no-hitter into the seventh before Jon Niese allowed a two-out single to Clint Robinson on a grounder that Ruben Tejada couldn’t field.\nWith the arms shutting down the Nats, the Mets needed just one run and Granderson provided it with his home run to center off Blake Treinen. Granderson hit 26 homers this year.\nFamilia tied the saves record in his first season as closer.\n“To tie it is a huge step, especially where we started Day One where all of a sudden we lost our closer [Jenrry Mejia],” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “[Familia] stepped up and did a tremendous job all year.”\nAs Collins walked through the clubhouse Sunday before the game, he noticed a sense of pride from his players for having secured a division title. Hours later, they won their 90th game.\nAfter the victory, Collins talked with Yoenis Cespedes, whose second-half heroics powered the team. Their conversation veered to what lies ahead.\n“He said, the fun’s just starting. And he’s right,” Collins said. “We worked hard to get there, and we’re going to enjoy it. We’re going to get ourselves ready this week and go out to L.A. and play like we know how.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:09:25.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
