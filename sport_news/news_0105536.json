(AP Photo/Andy Manis) more > By GENARO C. ARMAS   \nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - Alec Ingold ran for two short scores, Joel Stave threw for 322 yards and Wisconsin’s stifling defense held Purdue to a season-low 191 yards in a 24-7 victory on Saturday. \nThe Badgers (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten) overcame several penalties and other mistakes in the red zone to win on homecoming weekend at Camp Randall Stadium. \nWisconsin led just 10-7 late in the third quarter until two rushing touchdowns in an eight-minute span between the third and fourth quarters. \nT.J. Edwards then forced the Boilermakers’ Markell Jones to fumble at the Purdue 43. Safety Tanner McEvoy pounced on the ball to seal the win for the Badgers. \nEdwards, one of two freshmen starting at inside linebacker for Wisconsin, finished with 16 tackles. \nThe only score for Purdue (1-6, 0-3) came on David Blough’s 2-yard quarterback keeper in the second quarter. \nIt capped the worst stretch of the afternoon for Wisconsin. Purdue capitalized after Leroy Clark intercepted Stave at the 5 and returned the ball 66 yards. \nBlough’s score tied the game at 7. Just like two weeks ago in a 24-21 loss at Michigan State, the Boilermakers had designs of pulling off an unlikely upset on the road. \nIt took a while before Wisconsin could assert control. \nThe running game could only amass 96 yards against a Purdue defense that was giving up a Big Ten-worst 215 yards a game on the ground. \nBut the Badgers got production in the red zone from their tailbacks. \nDare Ogunbowale ran for 56 yards on 18carries and a 4-yard touchdown run on the last play of the third quarter for a 17-7 lead. \nIngold, a freshman, powered his way for a 1-yard score after breaking a tackle at the 3 with 7:16 left in the game. He finished with 19 yards on nine carries. \nAside from his bad throw that led to the pick, Stave was solid and finished 30 of 39. The Badgers moved the ball through the air to set up their tailbacks. \nStave connected with seven different receivers, led by nine catches for 86 yards for Alex Erickson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:07:36.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
