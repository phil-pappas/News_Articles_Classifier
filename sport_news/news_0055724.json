(AP) - A community college coach is facing an assault charge.\nWTOK-TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1W89yZr ) a student and soccer player at Meridian Community College has accused coach Alex George in an affidavit alleging simple assault by threat and two counts of physical simple assault.\nLauderdale County Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun says the student claims George verbally threatened him, punched him the head and grabbed him by his throat and cursed at him. A warrant was issued Oct 16.\nCalhoun says George surrendered to authorities, was booked and has since bonded out of jail.\nThis isn't the first time George has faced an assault charge. In 2010, he was accused of assault for an altercation at the State Games. The disposition of that case was not immediately known.\nInformation from: WTOK-TV, http://www.wtok.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
