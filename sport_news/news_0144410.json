Those closest to him have seen a different guy at Gillette Stadium. Yeah, Brady has always been dedicated enough to be the hardest working soul in the building, but a peeved Brady salivated over his new source of motivation.\nBecause of that, the 38-year-old is off to one of the best starts of his career, completing 72.2 percent of his passes for 1,112 yards and nine touchdowns with a 119.6 passer rating. It’s the first time he has ever started a season with three victories and no interceptions, and he leads the NFL in completions (96), attempts (133) and yards.\nAll the while, the Patriots set a franchise record with 119 points through three games, and are one of seven teams with a 3-0 record.\n“Before we really get to know what we’re all about, what the other teams are all about, it’s good to win the games however you can win them,” Brady said. “That’s what you’ve got to be able to do this time of year. But we’ve got a long road ahead, and I think everyone’s got to be tuned into what we’re trying to do in order to accomplish what our goals are.”\nBrady is also doing it at an age when he is supposed to be slowing down. Brett Favre (107.2 as a 40-year-old in 2009) and Peyton Manning (101.5 as a 38-year-old in 2014) are the only quarterbacks to play 16 games and compile a triple-digit passer rating after turning 38. Both won 12 regular-season games but failed to reach the Super Bowl. John Elway, at 38, the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, completed 59.0 percent for 2,806 yards, 22 touchdowns, 10 interceptions and a 93.0 passer rating in 1998 when he went 10-2 in the regular season.\nSo again, Brady is on pace to throw the record books in a fire if he carries the Patriots to a fifth Super Bowl title, which would also bury any debate over the greatest of all-time.\nIt seems unfathomable that Brady might still be playing his best at this advanced stage of his career, but he has uncovered ways to do it.\n“There are a lot of things I always want to improve on,” Brady said. “(I’m) always trying to become a better player for our team. A lot of those things are personal.”\nSo far, it’s not good enough for Brady. With Bill Belichick’s obvious formality in mind that three September victories are worth squat, Brady focused less on the 51 points, six red-zone touchdowns, franchise record-tying 35 first downs and 11 third-down conversions after Sunday’s lopsided 51-17 victory against the Jaguars, and more on the two red-zone field goals and three third-down failures.\nSeriously?\n“This is the level that we need to get to if we want to be able to compete on a week-by-week basis against really good football teams,” Brady said of the demands for long-term improvement. “We’re going to be challenged throughout the whole season.”\nIt’s clearly a strong vouch of character that the Patriots are never content, but the complete unwillingness to revel in nearly perfect performances reflects more on Brady’s desire to stare the league’s naysayers, conspiracy theorists and witch hunters in the face and dare them to question the legitimacy of his accomplishments.\nIf you say deflated footballs, Brady will raise you a 73.6 completion percentage, 1,571 yards, 15 touchdowns and two interceptions while outscoring opponents, 175-94, since halftime of the AFC Championship Game against the Colts. That included the greatest fourth-quarter comeback in Super Bowl history against a Seahawks defense that was moments away from being crowned as one of the most dominant units of all-time.\nBy Brady’s standards, the Patriots are off to “a decent start.” Just imagine what the Pats look like if he thinks they get rolling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:31:00.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
