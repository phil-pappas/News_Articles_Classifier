Stewart and Mike Hughes have been suspended indefinitely for a violation of team rules, sidelining them for Saturday's game against Wake Forest.\nIn a release Thursday night, the school said Stewart and Hughes were suspended from team-related activities tied to an Oct. 4 incident in Chapel Hill. The release didn't specify exactly what rule they had broken, though a statement from coach Larry Fedora referenced an \"altercation\" and that UNC has worked with Chapel Hill police to gather information.\n\"We hold our players to a high standard,\" Fedora said, \"and M.J. and Mike will face the consequences for their involvement.\"\nA check of court and police records found no reports or pending cases tied to either player.\nStewart, a sophomore, has started all five games for the Tar Heels (4-1) and is fifth on the team with 20 tackles. It is the second suspension that will sideline him for a game; he was among four players to miss last year's opener related to an altercation with a walk-on during training camp.\nHughes, a freshman, has played in every game as a reserve and has three tackles.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
