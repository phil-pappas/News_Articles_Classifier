Nazareth's shutout was its first since Week 8 of 2013, giving this year's team an accomplishment not reached by last year's 14-0 Class 6A champions.\nIvory Kelly-Martin ran for three of the Roadrunners' touchdowns, with Julian Love accounting for the other two. Kelly-Martin finished with 148 yards on 17 attempts, Love with 99 on 10.\n\"We work really hard in practice and we were able to put everything together tonight,\" Ivory-Kelly said. \"It's early to be talking about what will happen in the playoffs, but when we play like that, we like our chances.\"\nIndeed, few teams can match the one-two punch that of Ivory-Kelly and Love, a Notre Dame recruit. No. 13 Nazareth (5-1, 3-1) also was fearsome on defense Friday, especially with Benet quarterback Jack Sznajder leaving the game after a back injury on the Redwings' second series.\nThe Roadrunners yielded 71 total yards, sacked Benet quarterbacks four times and forced 10 punts. Love ended another drive for the Redwings (4-2, 2-2) with an interception of backup quarterback Mike Dunn in the second quarter.\n\"We came in and executed just as we wanted to,\" said sophomore linebacker Wesley Lones, who had one of the four sacks. \"Our deal tonight was we wanted to send a message to the ESCC and I believe we did that on the defensive side.\"\nPrep football: No. 16 Naperville Central strikes quickly vs. No. 14 Batavia Mike Clark The trust between Conor Joyce and Emmanuel Rugamba is evident.\nFive years of playing together will build that kind of a bond, which was on display Friday night in Batavia.\nJoyce hit Rugamba in stride for a pair of long touchdowns in the first quarter, a 1-2 punch from which Batavia never recovered.\n...

(Mike Clark) Nazareth's next challenge awaits next Friday, when the Roadrunners travel to face ESCC leader Joliet Catholic. Nazareth defeated the Hilltoppers 24-21 last season on its way to the conference crown.\nSteve Reaven is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\nPlayer of the game: Ivory Kelly-Martin, Nazareth, 17 carries, 148 yards, 3 TDs.\nKey performers: Nazareth — Julian Love, 10 carries, 99 yards, 2 TDs; INT.
