But relentless showers were gratefully the only comparison to Memorial Day storms that killed more than 30 people in Texas and Oklahoma and stranded 2,500 cars around Houston.\nOne man remained missing near San Antonio after authorities say he was caught by floodwaters, but no deaths in Texas have been confirmed. By Sunday morning, as swollen bayous around Houston receded and closed roads reopened in Austin, daybreak also revealed scant damage.\n\"We're going to stand down the emergency management operations and call it a day,\" said Galveston County Judge Mark Henry, who had issued a voluntary evacuation covering roughly 4,000 homes.\nPatricia roared ashore in Mexico on Friday as a Category 5 terror that barreled toward land with winds up to 200 mph. But the arrival of the most powerful hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere caused remarkably little destruction, and what was left of Patricia by the time the weakened storm straggled into parched Texas was greeted with both relief and unease.\nA hot and dry summer in Texas revived drought conditions that a wet spring all but wiped out. A deluge in late May overwhelmed saturated areas and caused deadly flooding, and 9 inches of rain dumped in parts of Houston this weekend was the most since those spring storms.\nAdvertisement But officials said months of sweltering Texas weather made for a more manageable drenching, which also fell at a steady rate instead of in buckets.\n\"We had much drier grounds that could handle more of the rainfall and soak it in,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Overpeck said. \"We had drought conditions we were dealing with.\"\nLessons learned from the May floods also seemed to keep more drivers out of danger, authorities said. Only roughly two dozen cars were towed from flooded roads in Houston, and emergency crews responded to only a handful of rescues, said Francisco Sanchez, a spokesman for Harris County's emergency management division.\n\"The public responded well. For the most part, they heeded our warnings,\" Sanchez said.\nThe soaking helped firefighters near Austin fully contain a long-simmering wildfire that had burned 7 square miles and destroyed nearly 70 homes. Clearing skies also allowed a Formula One championship in Austin to proceed after the rain washed out weekend qualifying laps and threatened a race that brings fans from around the globe.\nMexico mostly unharmed\nAs they catalogued the damage from the hemisphere's most ferocious hurricane, Mexican authorities marveled that they escaped relatively unscathed.\nBy Sunday morning, Mexican officials had concluded that although a few thousand homes had been damaged by Hurricane Patricia, there had been no reported deaths or catastrophic loss of property. The dangerous storm's magnitude — Category 5 — and wind speeds of as high as 200 mph had the power to wreak havoc, \"and that, fortunately, has not occurred,\" President Enrique Peña Nieto said.\n\"The preventive measures taken were the correct ones,\" Peña Nieto said Saturday from the airport in the coastal city of Manzanillo, near where the hurricane made landfall. \"Nature, above all, has been generous to Mexico.\"\nPatricia's effect was felt mostly in four coastal states, Colima, Jalisco, Michoacan and Nayarit. Peña Nieto said that about 3,500 homes were damaged. More than 200,000 people lost power, although half of them quickly regained it. All major roads, ports and airports along the coast were operating normally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:03:49.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
