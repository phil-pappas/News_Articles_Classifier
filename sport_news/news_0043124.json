He’s a leader. He’s got a plan and he’s going to execute the plan.”\nEppler said Tuesday night that the Angels simply decided to go another direction with both Butcher and hitting coach Don Baylor, whose contract also isn’t being renewed. Eppler said he and Scioscia had been in regular communication, and that the Angels longtime manager had accepted the organizational decisions.\nScioscia did not immediately return a message Wednesday morning, but Butcher said Wednesday that he and Scioscia had talked several times since the decision was made.\n“Mike and I had a great relationship,” Butcher said. “This is nothing to do with Mike at all.”\nFor now, Butcher walks away confident that he will find another job, and content with what he did with the Angels.\n“I’m ready for the next chapter in my life,” he said. “Ready to move on. It’s time. I have a lot of great memories of the organization the coaches, the players the pitchers, everybody involved.\n“I’m very proud of the work we did as a group. The work of the pitching staff we had for years speaks for itself. I have no regrets at all.”\nMeanwhile, the Angels are also looking for a new hitting coach, but at least one player will be sorry to see Baylor go.\n\"He was a great dude,\" Kole Calhoun said of Baylor. \"Whenever you needed any pointers, he was always there for the mental side. He had an approach to the game that was kind of fearless. He wanted you to go out and mash. It's definitely sad to see him go. His few years were awesome for me and a lot of the other guys.\"\nCalhoun said the Angels' scoring decline -- from leading the league in runs in 2014 to 12th in 2015 -- was about changing personnel, not coaching. The Angels lost the production of Howie Kendrick and Josh Hamilton, and got subpar years from Matt Joyce and Chris Iannetta .\n\"I don’t think it's anything that has to do with (Baylor),\" Calhoun said. \"We had some parts that moved form the year before. It was a different team. We wanted to score more runs, that’s for sure. But I don’t think you can relate that 'Groove.' He's not not in the box. When he was in the box he was hitting balls all over the place.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:30:50.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
