UTSports.com was along for the ride as Holly Warlick, Bashaara Graves and Jordan Reynolds met the media.7:01 a.m. Graves and Reynolds arrive at UT Flight Operations on the access road outside Knoxville McGee-Tyson Airport. A Chick-Fil-A breakfast awaits the players and staff, somewhat of a media day tradition before the usual early-morning flight.Warlick joins the travel party at 7:13, a cool two minutes before scheduled departure time. With the head coach in tow, the Lady Vols are locked and loaded in the UT plane at 7:15 and the plane rolls...about 100 yards. Fog and flight traffic in the Charlotte area force the Lady Vols to wait on the runway in Knoxville, needing to be cleared to land in North Carolina before they could depart Tennessee.While waiting out the delay, Warlick notices the new design on the front page of her USA Today newspaper, pausing for a moment before realizing the front page is a reprint of the famous Oct. 22, 2015, paper from the movie Back to the Future Part II.9:05 a.m. After a 45-minute delay and a 50-minute flight, Tennessee is on the ground in Charlotte and in a shuttle to the SEC Network studios. Once at the network HQ, Warlick splits from Graves and Reynolds to record a couple of segments to be used on SEC Network and ESPNU programming later in the fall.The players head across the street to another building in the office complex where ESPN has its Charlotte studio space to record Q&A sessions and photo and video shoots.9:45 a.m. Graves is first in the SEC Network hot seat, with Reynolds peering at her through the glass window separating the office from the lobby.We find out quickly that Graves chose basketball over ballet, though the background does explain the grace with which she executes some of her moves in the low post.The next topic is decidedly different. Graves has to form a girl band, a la Destiny's Child, out of members of her team.\"I would pick me, Te'a Cooper, Jordan Reynolds and Meme Jackson to be in it,\" Graves said. Te'a would be the lead singer, Meme and I would be dancers, and Jordan would be the backup singer.\"But do any of them have actual musical talent?\"No,\" she replied quickly. \"But we would be very entertaining.\"Reynolds would set up her band a little differently.\"I would be in it, Meme Jackson would be in it, Te'a Cooper, Mercedes Russell, I guess Bashaara and Alexa Middleton,\" Reynolds said. \"I would be the lead singer because I can sing, Te'a and Meme would be my backup dancers because they can dance. The rest of them would be the doo-wop people behind us.\"But what about Graves proclaiming herself a dancer?\"Bashaara can't dance,\" Reynolds said laughing hysterically. \"She can't dance so she can't dance in my band. Sorry, Bashaara.\"10:38 a.m. After changing into their new Nike game uniforms, Graves and Reynolds moved down the hall to shoot video segments on a giant green screen, which will allow the objects placed around them to be transformed into giant SEC and Lady Vol logos for promotional videos used throughout the season and for video board features at the SEC Tournament in March.A still photo shoot followed with the usual round of posed serious and smiling shots in full uniform. Each player was encouraged to pose in a signature celebration that is their go-to during games.Reynolds convinced Graves to go with the \"And one\" celebration after she scores and is fouled in the lane. Graves, always laughing, found it difficult to channel the emotions that come with the celebration during games. Reynolds offered to foul her.Finally, Graves got her mind right, but her voice was far behind. Yelling \"And one!\" in celebration came out with a little higher pitch than normal, drawing laughs from the rest of the room.Reynolds went with a standard celebration. The only request from the photographer? Don't be high-pitched in her scream. Mission Accomplished.11:19 a.m. As her players met the local and national media that had assembled in the main conference room at the SEC Network studios, Warlick recorded her \"Coach's Clicker\" segment with analyst Debbie Antonelli that will air later on network programming. Warlick diagrammed one of the Lady Vols' signature plays, then walked viewers through a video of her team executing it to perfection in a game last season.After her segment, Warlick found the Tennessee football helmet in the \"hall of helmets\" outside the studio rooms and donned it for photos. Like the rest of Vol Nation, Warlick just wanted to show how ready she is for the Third Saturday in October rivalry game with Alabama this weekend.12:02 p.m. Graves and Reynolds take a turn in the SEC Network marketing room, where they go through a list of word association games with ESPN staff. This year was a little different. Instead of using words, the players had to act out the emojis that would describe their mood at a given situation.Fouling out of the game led to a single sad tear from Graves, a healthy dose of side-eye from Reynolds.\"I know I really didn't foul anybody,\" Reynolds said.Practice being cancelled caused Reynolds to put on the provided sunglasses. Graves took a more spiritual approach, making the praying hands motion.\"Thank you, God,\" she said.They also asked what college teams, other than Tennessee, the players rooted for. Reynolds went with a perfectly reasonable response, mentioning the Oregon team that represents her home state. As far as Graves, we will leave her answer alone by saying only that cheering for friends and former teammates creates some very questionable rooting interests.Finally, the players were asked to give Warlick a hashtag for Twitter.\"#Dangblabbit,\" Reynolds said. \"Whenever we mess up in practice, she throws something and says `dangblabbit.'\"Graves was simpler with hers.\"#Country,\" she said.12:31 p.m.The coaches and players of the Southeastern Conference all came together on the outdoor court in front of the building for a \"family photo\" before the teams in the morning session departed for home. A 15-minute car ride and a 45-minute flight later, the Lady Vols were headed for practice. A day spent talking basketball, but also preparing for it, with the Nov. 8 exhibition opener quickly approaching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:09:17.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
