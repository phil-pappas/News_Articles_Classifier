Jose Altuve hit a leadoff single before George Springer walked, setting up runners on first and second with no one out for Carlos Correa. \nCorrea singled to right to advance Altuve and Springer, marking Correa's first career postseason hit. Correa is now the youngest player in Astros history to record a postseason hit. With first-inning single at 21 years, 16 days, @TeamCJCorrea is youngest player with a #postseason hit in #Astros history. — Houston Astros (@astros) October 9, 2015 \nRasmus grounded out to second to score Altuve and put the Astros on the board, 1-0. Evan Gattis followed suit by grounding out to short to score Springer and extend the Astros' lead to 2-0. \nHouston scored again in the top of the second inning when Altuve scored Jake Marisnick from second with a double to right, putting the Astros up, 3-0. \nKansas City didn't score until the bottom of the second when Kendrys Morales hit a solo home run off of McHugh. The game was then delayed because of rain just before 7:30 p.m. CT. \nPlay resumed at 8:15 p.m. CT, and it seemed the delay shifted momentum for Houston. Chris Young came in to relieve Ventura and struck out Correa. Rasmus walked, and Gattis struck out swinging before Rasmus stole second with one out and Luis Valbuena at bat. Young, however, struck out Valbuena to end the inning. \nYoung was at it again in the top of the fourth, this time striking out Chris Carter, Castro and Marisnick. The woes continued for Houston in the bottom of the fourth when Morales hit yet another solo home run off of McHugh to cut the Astros' lead to 3-2. \nThe Astros came back to life in the top of the fifth inning when Springer hit a solo shot off Young to extend the Astros' lead, 4-2. Per Statcast, the #SpringerDinger was 422 feet and 109 MPH off the bat. That was crushed. #Astros — Houston Astros (@astros) October 9, 2015 \nMarisnick's great diving catch robbed Alcides Escobar of a hit with two runners on and one out in the bottom of the fifth. McHugh retired the side in the bottom of the sixth. \nOct 8, 2015; Kansas City, MO, USA; Houston Astros center fielder Jake Marisnick makes a diving catch in the fifth inning against the Kansas City Royals in game one of the ALDS at Kauffman Stadium.

Springer and Correa both struck out to end the inning. \nTony Sipp came in to relieve McHugh in the top of the seventh. McHugh pitched six innings, allowed four hits, two runs and recorded one strikeout. \nHouston finally got another jolt when Rasmus hit a solo home run off of Ryan Madson in the top of the eighth. Colby Rasmus is 5th player in MLB history to record an extra-base hit in his 1st 5 career #postseason games, tying an MLB record. #Astros — Houston Astros (@astros) October 9, 2015 \nKansas City came close to catching up in the bottom of the eighth after Ben Zobrist singled to center and Lorenzo Cain singled to left, putting the tying run at the plate. Oliver Perez came in to relieve Harris, but Eric Hosmer fouled out to third. \nSpringer gave Houston a chance to extend its lead with a base hit with no one on and two outs, but Correa grounded out to first. \nLuke Gregerson came in to relieve Perez in the bottom of the ninth. He struck out Morales swinging but hit Mike Moustakas with a pitch, putting him on first with one out. Gregerson struck out Salvador Perez, and Alex Gordon fouled out to left to end the game.
