Summer sessions make Pack's Richardson one of MW's best \nOffensive MVP \nRB Don Jackson: Backup James Butler actually has two more yards than Jackson (571 to 569), but Jackson has been highly productive (5.4 yards per carry) and has scored seven times. He's also been the team's overall leader and a positive force after Nevada had that devastating defeat to UNLV. \nDefensive MVP \nDE Lenny Jones: Like with Jackson, a lot of Jones' impact comes behind the scenes in the leadership department, but he's also been impactful on the field where he has 20 tackles, five tackles for loss, four sacks, a fumble recovery and three pass breakups. A maturing Jones is having an excellent senior season. \nCoach of the year \nScott Boone: The team's defensive coordinator has made a positive impact in his two years at Nevada, which allowed 34.1 ppg in the two years prior to arrival and has allowed 27.4 ppg in the two years since his arrival. After predictable struggles against Arizona and Texas A&M, the defense has tightened up. \nStat of the year \n222.3: The Wolf Pack might rank 81st in the FBS in total offense and 90th in scoring offense, but the team's run game has been productive. Nevada's 222.3 rushing yards per game rank 20th in the nation (10th among Group of 5 teams) and the team is on track to have two 1,000-yard running backs. \nFreshman of the year \nSS Asauni Rufus: Tough call between Nevada's safeties, Rufus and Dameon Baber. They both deserve it. Baber, a true freshman, has three interceptions and 24 tackles in three games. Rufus has started since the opener and is second on the team in tackles (48) with a forced fumble that saved a touchdown. \nSophomore of the year \nOT Austin Corbett: In addition to his strong play, Corbett, a quiet guy by nature, has stepped up vocally as the line has been hit hard by injuries. Coaches and teammates give him a lot credit for holding the Union together last week when Nevada was forced to use its No. 4 and 5 offensive guards. \nJunior of the year \nWR Jerico Richardson: In his last two games, Richardson has 17 catches for 208 yards and two touchdowns. He leads the MW in receptions (37), which is a considerable feat considering Nevada runs the ball on more than 60 percent of its plays. Richardson has emerged as Tyler Stewart's top weapon. \nSenior of the year \nLB Matthew Lyons: You could go in a number of directions here, especially on Nevada's senior-laden defensive line, but we'll go with Lyons, who leads the Wolf Pack with 54 tackles, including four for loss. With Nevada's other two starting linebackers dealing with injuries, Lyons has been a steady force. \nPlay of the year (positive) \nHenderson's highlight-reel catch: Hasaan Henderson scored a SportsCenter top-10 play when he reeled in a 27-yard touchdown catch against Texas A&M with one hand as he was being pushed to the ground. A pass interference was called, but Henderson caught the ball anyway for a big play on an SEC stage. \nPlay of the year (negative) \nUNLV's pick-six: Quarterback Tyler Stewart has been solid this season, but he did have one big mistake against UNLV, a pick-six after Nevada pulled within 13-10 with 9 minute remaining. The interception and score, by linebacker Ryan McAleenan, was the difference in Nevada's 23-17 loss the rival Rebels. \nBest position group (offense) \nRunning backs: Jackson and Butler have run hard and aggressive and have made it a habit of picking up yards after contact. They rank fourth (Butler) and fifth (Jackson) in the MW in rushing yards and is the only duo in the FBS to both average at least 94 yards per game, which some help from the offensive line. \nBest position group (defense) \nDefensive line: The line is starting to play to its potential and was dominant against New Mexico last week. It's easy to point to the tackles for loss and sack numbers put up by Jones and Ian Seau but the team's defensive tackles, led by nose guard Salesa Faraimo, also have played well of late. \nQuote of the year: \"I'm getting out of the business of getting upset with the officials. That does me no good.\" – Polian, when asked about a penalty that nullified a defensive touchdown against Texas A&M one week after being fined $10,000 by Nevada for his sideline behavior against Arizona \nSocial media win of the year \nKudos to the Wolf Pack for pulling up the following GIF when Butler hit for a 91-yard run against Buffalo and then Jackson followed that with a 55-yard scoring run on the next drive. When Butler rushes for 91-yards, then Jackson rushes for 55 on the very next drive.&#10; #NEVvsBUFF pic.twitter.com/5AiZFOZ3CJ — Nevada Football (@NevadaFootball) September 26, 2015 \nToughest game remaining \nAt Utah State: Nevada only has one game left against a team that currently has a winning record, so the schedule lines up nicely for a run. That team is Utah State, which Nevada plays Nov. 21. The Aggies have been an upper-echelon MW team since moving to the league and this year is no different. \nMost important game remaining \nAt San Diego State: The Wolf Pack closes the regular season with the Aztecs and both teams are hoping that game is for the West Division title. San Diego State and San Jose State are the frontrunners at this point but things are wide open for Nevada, which has a favorable schedule the rest of the season. \nProjected final record \nAt the beginning of the season, I pegged Nevada for a 7-5 overall record and 5-3 mark in the MW. Nothing I've seen so far has changed that. If anything, the struggles begotten by Nevada's next three opponents – Wyoming (0-6), Hawaii (can't score) and Fresno State (dumpster fire) – should make Nevada's outlook rosier. For now, I'll stick with the 7-5 and 5-3 projection, but there's room for better. \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
