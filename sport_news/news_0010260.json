Picture: Facebook\nRohan Smith news.com.au GARRETT Holeve can’t comprehend a lot of what other 26-year-olds can. His reading and maths skills are at a primary-school level and his cognitive ability is half his age. He slurs his speech.\nDespite what some might see as limitations, he enters a ring and takes part in one of the most brutal sports on the planet, all with the blessing of his mum and dad.\nHoleve, who goes by the fighting name “G Money”, has Down syndrome. Last year he pummelled David “Cerebral Assassin” Steffan in a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) bout.\nSteffan is a former Special Olympian born with cerebral palsy who has limited use of one of his arms. He lost in a choke hold after tapping out.\nHoleve’s desire to fight is jarring for most people. They can’t understand why a person with a disability would want to fight and they worry about the health risks of participating in a sport where the main aim is to inflict physical pain on an opponent.\nA new documentary might help them understand . It reveals the ups and downs for the pint-sized brawler, how he fell in love with the sport and why his fight for recognition is the most important fight of his life.\nGarrett Holeve, aka ‘G Money’. Picture: Stian Roenning Source: Supplied\n‘I DON’T WANT TO BE GARRETT HOLEVE’\nG Money isn’t just a name. It’s a brand. It’s emblazoned on T-shirts with the symbol of a skull that fans of the up-and-coming fighter can’t get enough of.\nHoleve gave himself that nickname as an 18-year-old. His father Mitch told The Palm Beach New Times in 2012 that his son would scratch the name off his paychecks and write “G Money” instead.\n“I sat him down and told him he can’t do that anymore,” Mitch said. “And he said, ‘That’s not my name.’ I said, ‘Yeah, that’s the name your mother and I gave you’ and he said, ‘Garrett Holeve has Down syndrome, and I don’t want to be Garrett Holeve.’”\nThe name gives him power but he’s still vulnerable. His father knows that more than anybody.\n“You’ve got to be brain damaged to think I want my son punched in the face,” he told documentary makers in a film that aired this week .\nStill, he didn’t stop Holeve when he showed interest. Instead, he gave him his full support.\nThe former boxer trains him personally but he enlists some help these days from Rodrigo Ramos, a professional fighter from Florida. Ramos takes a no-nonsense approach to his training. He says Holeve should expect no special treatment.\n“We didn’t coddle him or baby him at all,” he told the Times . “After the first day, I didn’t see him as a guy with Down syndrome. Poor guy, my ass.”\nGarrett Holeve puts everything into his training. Picture: Facebook Source: Supplied\n‘IT’S VIOLENT, THERE’S BLOOD ALL OVER THE CAGE’\nHoleve has his supporters, but plenty of people don’t want to see him fight.\nHe was originally slated to fight Steffan on August 23, 2013. At the last possible moment, when the two fighters were warmed up and the crowd was buzzing, the Florida State Boxing Commission issued a cease-and-desist order.\nHis father said “It destroyed their dream”. He said G was being given special treatment when he just wanted to be like anybody else.\n“He had the right to do what he wanted to do,” he said. “They shouldn’t discriminate against him just because he has an extra chromosome.”\nMitch Holeve told ESPN he’s been criticised by the general public but also members of his own family.\n“They said to me that I’m crazy. They’ve lost respect for me as a parent from the fact that I’m allowing this to happen.”\nOthers compared the sport to cockfighting and warned it was no place for a person with a disability. The family forged on regardless, suing the state for the chance to get back in the ring. They were unable to fight in Florida but Missouri agreed to host the fight in December last year.\nMitch Holeve told the Guardian Garrett knows he has Down syndrome.\n“He’s come in with half a lunch box to work every day but he works as hard as anybody else. He won’t quit. Unfortunately society has put limits on what they’re prepared to let these people do, which is wrong.”\nHis mother Susan says people in general are either comfortable around people with intellectual or physical disabilities or they’re not.\n“The people uncomfortable watching it are the people who would be uncomfortable sitting down and having a meal with Garrett.”\nHis father says he hopes those who are uncomfortable understand that the only limitations placed on people with a disability are external.\n“Society is just getting acquainted with what people with Down syndrome can do,” he said. “It’s Garrett’s generation that is really proving this. He’s a pioneer as an adaptive athlete in Mixed Martial Arts.”\nG Money calls himself “an inspiration”. He’s looking for his next opponent.\n“I’m a fighter,” he said. “That’s what I am. The only thing I want to be is a fighter.”\nGarrett Holeve with MMA fan Channing Tatum.
