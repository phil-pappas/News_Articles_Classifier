Riverdale leads the series 32-14. \n\"It's kind of like pulling a pickle out of a jar,\" Creasy said. \"Once you get that first one; hopefully, it will be easier after that. This wasn't easy.\" \nOakland (7-1 overall, 5-0 in Region 2-6A) played without two-way starting lineman Hudson Smith and starting safety Kaleb Oliver. \n\"We were very disappointed that we had to bench two of the starters for violation of team rules,\" Creasy said. \nPatterson scored on touchdown runs of 82, 10 and 65 in the game. He has seven total touchdowns and 332 yards over the past two weeks. \n\"This feels really great,\" Patterson said. \"I'm really finally grateful that we understand the (Wing-T) offense. We are showing what we can do because we started kind of rough. \n\"I finally understand the offense and the blocking schemes. I'm starting to rip it up a little bit more.\" \nOakland finished with 41 carries for 355 yards. The Patriots finished with 401 yards. \nRiverdale (5-3, 3-2) finished with 245 total yards, including 68 yards on the ground. Riverdale quarterback Brandon Bea was 13-of-28 passing for 177 yards with three interceptions. \n\"We stopped the run a little bit,\" Oakland linebacker Jackson Cauthen said. \"We had some busted coverages. They beat us deep a couple of times. But for the most part we played pretty good I think.\" \nGene Odom's 10-yard TD run combined with Canaan Owens' catch on a 2-point conversion gave Riverdale an early 8-7 lead. \nHowever, LSU commitment JaCoby Stevens made it 15-8 at halftime when he scored on a 9-yard run out of a Wildcat formation. \nPatterson's second TD of the night combined with Jackson Cauthen's 25-yard interception returned for a TD made it 29-8 with 5:14 left in the third quarter. Patterson then broke off his final TD run to end the quarter to put the game out of reach. \nOdom reeled in a 45-yard TD catch and run from Bea with 9:16 left to trim it to 36-14. But Oakland quarterback Brendan Matthews ended the scoring on a 4-yard TD run with 5:40 left. \nReach Tom Kreager at 615-278-5168 and on Twitter @Kreager.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:44:11.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
