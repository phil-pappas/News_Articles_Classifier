(AP) - Big Ben. \nBuckingham Palace. \nThe Tower of London. \nThey might all remain unchecked on many New York Jets players’“must-see” lists. \nThe team left for London on Thursday night, but this is no European vacation. Coach Todd Bowles wants his Jets players focused on the task at hand - playing the Miami Dolphins on Sunday - and not sightseeing. \n“They’ve got enough money, they can make it in the offseason,” Bowles said with a laugh Thursday. “They will be OK, they’ll be all right. They get a little bit of free time, they can do their tour. We’re on a business trip. They want to go back in the offseason, hey, have at it.” \nThe Jets will be playing their first game overseas since a preseason game in Japan against Tampa Bay in 2003. While he was coach of the Buffalo Bills, Jets offensive coordinator Chan Gailey traveled with his team to Toronto three times - but that did little to prepare him for this type of trip. \n“We never had to leave Thursday,” Gailey said, “to drive to Toronto two hours.” \nThis trip was seven-plus hours in the air, and the Jets planned to practice Friday at a London-area facility. They hold a walkthrough on Saturday at Wembley Stadium and then play the Dolphins there on Sunday. \nThe team intended to check out the surface of the field to prepare for what they might face during the game. \n“I’ve heard that it comes up a little bit and it’s a little soggy,” Bowles said. “I’ll see how it is when we get there.” \nRight tackle Breno Giacomini has spoken to some players who have played at Wembley before, and recommends his teammates bring their regular cleats as well as studded shoes just to be prepared for any playing surface. \n“I’ve done it before where we played on a bad field late in the playoffs and we had to change our cleats,” he said. “I just tell these guys, it’s just another thing. Just bring ‘em and try them out.” \nBowles tried to keep the players on as normal a schedule as possible, which is why he opted to stay in New Jersey until the end of the week. \nThe team watched film of last Sunday’s loss to Philadelphia on Monday at the facility, the players had off on Tuesday and then the Jets had full practices both Wednesday and Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:32:46.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
