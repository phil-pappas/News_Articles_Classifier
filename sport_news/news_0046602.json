MARIE — What a difference a few days makes. On Saturday, coach Lisa Moran was feeling good about her team after Sault High reached the semifinals in the St. Ignace Invitational despite the loss of sophomore hitter Cece Werner just seven points into the first game. Tuesday night was a completely different story as the Blue Devils struggled in all phases and dropped the match 3-1 to the visiting Rogers City Hurons. “The difference between Saturday and tonight was like day and night,” Moran said. “We played with a complete lack of focus except for the third set. I was really expecting us to play a lot better than we did.” In the first set, the Sault fell 25-13 as the Hurons continually attacked the back corners of the Sault defense. Both teams struggled in the service game early on, but it was Rogers City that was able to overcome the struggles and cruise to the win. The second set was a closer affair after the Blue Devils fell behind early. Libero Brenna James began serving with the Sault trailing 14-8. When Rogers City finally got the serve back, James had sparked the Devils to a 15-14 lead. Passing difficulties plagued the Sault all night long though, and that was a big cause for the 25-20 loss suffered in the second set. “We really struggled with our passing tonight,” Moran said. “Jacki (Sanderson) set pretty well for what she had to work with, but it’s really pretty simple — you can’t get kills if you can’t pass the ball.” The Sault dug deep in the third set and came up with a 25-19 win. Maddi Fegan began serving with the score tied at 13-13, helped gain the Devils an 18-13 lead before relinquishing the serve. “We moved our feet in that third game,” Moran said. “We started talking more and kept our focus on the floor.” Instead of carrying that momentum into the fourth set however, the Sault seemed to wilt, getting aced on two of Rogers City’s first three serves. The Devils didn’t get their first point until they trailed 7-0 and were never any closer than six the rest of the way, falling 25-7. The Sault was aced five times in the set, including the match-winning point. The Sault, (12-4-4), missed Werner in the contest and will probably be without her again on Thursday when the team travels to Grayling for another non-conference match. “We look to Cece in the front,” Moran said. “Saturday, we showed ourselves that we can hit without her. The problem is, she not only hits, but passes too. Without her, we were definitely out of our comfort zone.” Page 2 of 2 - The Devils are hoping to have Werner back next week in time for their Straits Area Conference match against the Cheboygan Chiefs. Maddi Misiak led the Sault on the stat sheet with five kills and 13 digs, while Jordan Menard had five kills and five digs. Ella Rechner finished with four kills and four blocks. James had nine digs, while Sanderson added 14 assists and nine digs. The Sault won the JV match in straight sets.
