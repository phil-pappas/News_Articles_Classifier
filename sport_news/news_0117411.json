He followed with rounds of 70 at the Marion Country Club in the Marion City/County Invitational and a 69 in the Mid Ohio Athletic Conference Tournament at Oakhaven Golf Club to place first in both of those tournaments. \nOrewiler attributed his hot start to a fine summer, especially in one event. \n“I won a tournament in Chicago (the GolfWeek Midwest Invitational at Cog Hill) late in the summer, and I felt real confident,” Orewiler said. “I also knew I had a great group of guys around me at River Valley, so I had no worries teeing it up.” \nOrewiler, a four-time winner of the Fahey Bank award, was then medalist in 9 of 14 events to conclude his regular season. He averaged 35.1 strokes per nine-hole round this season. \nUp next was the sectional tournament at Oakhaven, and Orewiler won it with a nifty score of 67. \n“I felt like I could have played better,” he said. “I missed a couple of 10-foot birdie putts.” \nHe went on to district play, where only the district champion advanced to the Division II state tournament. \nOrewiler shot a 71 at the Denison Golf Club in Granville, but that was only good enough for a tie for first place. Orewiler then finished second in the event by losing in a playoff for first place. \n“I knew what I had to do at the district, but I fell just short,” he said. “It sucked, but that’s life.” \nOrewiler was nonetheless pleased with the fact he gave himself a chance to advance. \n“I didn’t have my A game, but I stayed patient and I stayed close until the end,” he said. “It’s something you have to accept and move on.” \nOrewiler played in the state tourney a year ago, and he lamented the fact he couldn’t return this year. \n“I looked forward to that. Winning a state championship was another thing on my list to get,” Orewiler said. “Growing up, the state championship was it for me. I feel like there is something missing.” \nHe’ll try to find that when he moves on to play college golf under scholarship at Ohio State University. \n“I have high school records and a district player of the year award, but maybe there is something bigger out there,” Orewiler said. “I will play golf with great guys from across the country in college, and then I will see where my golf game is. I’ll know where I stand after college.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:54:42.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
