New Jersey is 0-3-1 under new coach John Hynes. \nPatrick Marleau scored for the Sharks in the opening minute and the goal stood until Adam Henrique ended Jones' shutout bid with a tying power-play goal. \nHenrique scored for New Jersey on its first shootout attempt, but Jacob Josefson was stopped on the second and Mike Cammalleri missed the net on the third. \nOn his goal, Henrique tipped a shot from the point by Damon Severson past Jones. It was the first goal Jones had allowed in a franchise-record 234 minutes, 33 seconds. The only score he had given up this season came on the first shot he faced in the season opener against the Kings. \nBoth goaltenders were tested in the overtime, with Cory Schneider making the best stop, a pad save on Burns after he deked two Devils in front for a one-on-one chance in close. \nHenrique hit a goalpost earlier in the extra five minutes, and Kyle Palmieri missed the net on a breakaway for New Jersey. \nThe Devils thought they tied the game late in the second period while killing off a penalty. Stephen Gionta got a step on Paul Martin and made a power move toward Jones from the left circle. Martin pushed him from behind, and Gionta crashed into Jones as he shoved a shot on goal. Josefson fired the rebound into an open net, but referee Dan O'Halloran immediately waved off the goal. \nThe Devils complained, the crowd booed and Jones' shutout streak continued. \nSchneider, who was returning to the lineup after missing two games for the birth of his son, kept New Jersey in the game earlier in the period when he stopped a penalty shot by Marleau. Devils defenseman Andy Greene had hooked the Sharks' forward as he broke in for a shot, which he got off and Schneider handled. \nMarleau skated to his right and then cut across the crease on his penalty shot, but it went into the goaltender's chest. \nMarleau had opened the scoring in close at 2:01 of the first period after taking a pass from behind the net by Joel Ward. \nThe last NHL goaltender to post three straight shutouts was Ondrej Pavelec of Winnipeg late last season from Apr. 6-9. \nMartin, who was acquired in a trade with Boston, also got the benefit of a call from the officials when Josefson's short-handed goal was waved off after Gionta crashed into the goaltender before the shot. \nThe Sharks had to kill off two two-man advantages for New Jersey early in the third period. However, a late bench minor for too many skaters on the ice set up the power play that resulted in Henrique's goal. \nNOTES: Devils C Travis Zajac missed the game with a lower body injury. ... San Jose is adjusting to life without C Logan Couture for the next month or so. Couture broke his leg in practice on Thursday. Nikolay Goldobin, San Jose's first-round draft pick in 2014, was recalled from the minors. He skated on the top line with Joe Thornton and Pavelski. ... Tomas Hertl replaced Couture at center on a line with Marleau and Ward and picked up an assist. ... The old Sharks record for minutes without allowing a goal was set in 2014 by Alex Stalock, the No. 2 goaltender now. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:50:20.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
