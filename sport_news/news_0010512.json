His veteran presence and championship pedigree made him a prime candidate to replace former captain Jordan Henry, who is currently an unsigned free agent. \n“He’s been one of leaders since we won the Kelly Cup championship in 2012,” Florida coach Greg Poss said. “He’s been there, and he knows what it takes. He has a high level of passion for the game, and he displays that in the way he goes about his business.” \nDespite joining the team midway through the season, Marquardt demonstrated leadership values crucial to Florida’s successful 105-point campaign last year. \n“I’m honored; I hope it’s not just a sign that I’m old,” Marquardt, 28, said. “I look at the guys that have been here before who have worn the ‘C’— Jordan Henry, Mathieu Roy and Ernie Hartlieb — and that’s a pretty elite group of guys. Those are big skates to fill, but I feel like I have big feet, so I can step in there and lead the way.” \nThe Blades also named defenseman Mike Cornell the team’s only alternate captain. Poss said they may add additional alternate captains throughout the season after further observation of the roster. \nMarquardt spent the first half of the 2014-15 season playing overseas with Kaufbeuren ESV in DEL2. However, he got the itch to return to North America in January, despite posting 20 points in 37 games in the German hockey league. \nThe left wing played a vital role — on and off the ice — in the 40 regular-season games he played with Florida. The 6-foot-3, 229-pound power forward recorded 33 points (18 goals, 15 assists), and he posted another seven points in the team’s 12 playoff contests. \n“I bring the same approach to every game. I keep the mood light, but at the same time I’m intense,” the North Bay, Ontario, native said. “I feel like I play better when I have some responsibility. Ever since I came down here in 2012, Coach Poss and (general manager) Craig Brush have given me responsibility.” \nMarquardt’s teammates voted for him to become an alternate captain three months after his return to the team. \nHowever, Marquardt isn’t all business; he quickly became a lively figure in the clubhouse and a favorite among his teammates. \nHe best displayed his top-of-the-line locker room chemistry when he helped inspire the idea of making special playoff T-shirts, which read “Blades World Order”, for his teammates in April. \n“This is something I’ve always taken pride in is being a good teammate,” Marquardt said. “I’d rather be known as a good teammate than a good player. This is your home away from home, and your hockey team is your family. I’m a very family-oriented person, and I try to bring that to the locker room. That’s how you get the most out of your teammates.” \nMarquardt’s quest to help build a quality locker room stems from the 2011-12 championship season. \n“I won a championship here, and I know how much team camaraderie means,” Marquardt said. “That’s the biggest reason we won (in 2012). We were all brothers; we were a close-knit group, and we did everything for each other.” \nWhile Marquardt said it’s hard to replicate the brotherhood from that season, he believes it can be accomplished again this year. \n“The way this organization forms their team, they go after guys with good character and guys who want to win,” Marquardt said. “Our coaches and our GM — everyone from the top down — want to win. That’s the culture you need to have. They are people who refuse to lose.” Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
