(AP) - Mississippi's unemployment rate kept falling in September, as more people reported finding jobs.\nThe jobless rate fell to 6.1 percent from 6.3 percent in August, and was below September 2014's 7.3 percent rate.\nThe number of unemployed people fell even as the labor force grew, indicating the job market provided more new jobs than there were new job-seekers.\nA separate survey shows Mississippi payrolls were flat in September, leaving total payrolls 12,000 higher than last September.\nBoth sets of figures - adjusted to cancel out seasonal changes - were released Tuesday by the U.S. Labor Department.\nMississippi remained above the national average of 5.1 percent for unemployment, with the seventh-highest jobless rate among states.\nThere were 77,000 Mississippians unemployed in September, down 2,500 from August and 12,000 below September 2014\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
