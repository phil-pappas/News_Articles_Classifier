He'll face Notre Dame's Daniel Rayl on Friday morning at 7:00 am CT. \nDunn dispatched Green Bay's Rowan Isaaks, 6-2, 7-6, in their first-round match. Dunn moved on to the second round where he upset Ohio State's Charles Shewalter, 6-4, 6-3. Toledo's Vince Anzalone awaits Dunn in a match slated for Friday morning at 7:00 am CT. Seniors Lucas Waak (Manitowoc, Wis./Roncalli) and Michael Savaglio (Kenosha, Wis./Mary D. Bradford) dropped their first-round matches, but rebounded to take their consolation contests. \nNotre Dame's Brendon Kempin got past Waak 6-2, 6-7, 6-3 in the morning. Waak responded with a 6-4, 6-3 win over DePaul's Paul John. \nSavaglio fell to WMU's Andrew Cahn, 6-4, 6-3, but prevailed in his consolation tilt, 4-6, 6-2, 10-8 versus Cleveland State's Kevin Goth. \nSophomore Garrett Gardner (Poland, Ohio/Poland) was on the wrong end of a pair of three-set contests. Michigan's Davis Crocker outlasted Gardner 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, in the opening round of play. Gardner then dropped a 4-6, 6-2, 10-8 marathon match to UIC's Marcelo Dib. \nLive scoring will be available for Friday morning's matches.
