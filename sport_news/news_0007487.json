It will add about a quarter of a penny to each dollar spent at stores in the neighborhood.\nSupporters say tourists will pay most of the $2 million a year the tax is expected to bring in.\nIt raises the overall sales tax rate in the French Quarter to 9.25 percent for retail and nearly 10 percent for restaurants.\nExtra troopers have patrolled the neighborhood since the summer of 2014, when a woman was killed and nine other people wounded in a gunfight on Bourbon Street.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
