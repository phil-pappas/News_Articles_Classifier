Here's a breakdown of the game. \nNew Mexico (3-2, 1-0 MW) at Nevada (2-3, 0-1 MW) \nWhen: 4 p.m., Saturday \nWhere: Mackay Stadium (capacity, 30,000) \nTV/Radio: None/94.5 FM \nLine: Nevada favored by 4.5; total is 54 \nLast week: Nevada lost to UNLV; New Mexico beat New Mexico State \nPosition-by-position \nQuarterback: New Mexico’s Lamar Jordan isn’t going to beat you with his arm but he’s a dangerous rusher who steers the triple-option and averages 7.9 yards per carry. Nevada’s Tyler Stewart has to have a good mental game (he usually does) against the Lobos’ high-blitz defense. Edge: Nevada \nRunning backs: New Mexico rolls with Jhurell Pressley (347, 4.8 ypc, 3 TDs) and Teriyon Gipson (255/6.1/3) getting most of the carries. They’re a solid duo. Nevada’s Don Jackson and James Butler are running behind a banged-up line and have to grind out yards after contact. Edge: Nevada \nWide receivers/tight end: New Mexico’s Carlos Wiggins (5-8/166) is a small and dangerous threat (23.3 yards per catch). Nevada’s Hasaan Henderson (shoulder) should play. TE Jarred Gipson needs to get more involved in the passing game in addition to his pass-protection role. Edge: New Mexico The Sunday List: Wolf Pack's top-10 RBs \nOffensive line: Nevada’s line has been compromised with injuries with the team’s No. 4 and 5 guards (Ziad Damanhoury and Daren Echeveria) expected to see a lot of playing time versus the blitzing Lobos. New Mexico’s upperclassmen-ladden line has paved the way for 5.7 ypc. Edge: New Mexico \nDefensive line: The strength of Nevada’s line is its pass-rushing ability. That can’t be the strength Saturday as New Mexico doesn’t throw the ball. It’s all about pursuit in the run game and gap discipline. New Mexico switches between a three- and four-man front to disguise its packages. Edge: Nevada \nLinebackers: This is the strength of New Mexico. The group is led by MLB Dakota Cox, who has 37 tackles, 3.5 sacks, 6.5 TFL and is one of the MW’s best defenders. Nevada OLB Bryan Lane Jr. (ankle) is questionable. The Wolf Pack could really use his athleticism and pursuit skills. Edge: New Mexico \nSecondary: New Mexico’s Lee Crosby plays the Lobos’ “DUDE” position and he is a dude, with 27 tackles, 2.5 TFL, one sack, two turnovers and one TD. This is an athletic, aggressive group. Nevada’s secondary has stabilized since FS Dameon Baber (three INTs in two games) became a starter. Edge: New Mexico \nSpecial teams: New Mexico demoted K Jason Sanders (3-of-7) this week. P Zack Rogers, who has been excellent, will take on field goals. KR/PR Carlos Wiggins has four career return scores. Nevada K Brent Zuzo (7-of-7) is perfect in 2015. New Mexico has return edge; Nevada specialists edge. Edge: Nevada \nCoaching: Bob Davie has done a solid job of turning around the dumpster fire that is New Mexico. It’s taken a while, but the Lobos have improved in recent seasons and are a more dangerous team. Nevada’s Brian Polian has talked about resiliency with this game. We’ll see if the Pack has any. Edge: New Mexico \nPrediction \nNevada 28, New Mexico 27: I have zero percent confidence in this prediction. Nevada has struggled against Air Force’s triple-option and while New Mexico’s triple-option is different, it’s still the triple-option. If Nevada doesn’t limit the Lobos’ rushing attack, it doesn’t win this game. The Wolf Pack offense just doesn’t have the firepower to win a high-scoring affair. So, it’s up the defense to keep New Mexico in check and up to the offense to make some big plays off the Lobos’ blitzing attack. If Nevada wants a shot of winning the MW’s West Division, it had to win this game. You can’t begin the season 0-2 in conference with both games at home against lower-level competition. A loss here could send the Wolf Pack into a tailspin. Nevada needs to stop the bleeding from the UNLV loss Saturday. Season record: 4-1 \nA look at New Mexico \nLocation: Albuquerque, N.M. \nCoach: Bob Davie (14-28 overall, 5-20 league in four seasons at New Mexico; overall, 49-53, in nine seasons at Notre Dame and New Mexico) \nConference: Mountain West \nSeries history: Series tied, 2-2-1 \nLast game: Nevada won, 31-24, on Nov. 17, 2012 (in Albuquerque) Wolf Pack's helmets over the years \nNew Mexico on offense: No surprise here. The Lobos want to run the ball. A lot. They have 254 rushing attempts to 94 passing attempts, meaning New Mexico runs the ball nearly 75 percent of the time. The Lobos run what is essentially a triple-option out of the Pistol formation, so it’s a unique rushing attack that isn’t easy to stop. The Lobos’ 290 rushing yards per game ranks ninth in the nation and the team averages 5.7 yards per carry. It has 19 rushing touchdowns in five games and has a stable of backs. If you can stop New Mexico on first and second down, you will slow the offense down as the passing game still lags. New Mexico ranks 119th (out of 127 FBS teams) in passing efficiency. QB Lamar Jordan hits on just 50.9 percent of his passes for fewer than 85 yards per game. As a result, the Lobos convert 38.7 percent of its third downs, which is 74th nationally. Nevada needs to get New Mexico behind the chains early. \nNew Mexico on defense: New Mexico has an aggressive defense that can look like a 4-3 or a 3-4. The Lobos have 43 tackles for loss and 19 sacks in five games, both huge numbers. This team is going to blitz a lot, so it’s up to Tyler Stewart to get the ball out quickly and up to the receivers to beat man-to-man coverage. That aggressive defensive play calling has led to turnovers created, 10 in all, but it also has led to some big plays allowed. It’s a risk-reward scheme, and Nevada needs to make New Mexico pay for that risk while limiting turnovers. New Mexico’s run and pass defense are both about average, so there’s not one distinct weakness here. The Lobos have allowed at least 28 points in each of its four games against FBS opponents this season, and two of those games are against winless teams (Wyoming and New Mexico State), so there’s plenty of opportunity for Nevada’s struggling offense to perk up. \nKey matchup: Nevada front seven vs. New Mexico rushing attack: Nevada hasn’t had the best success against the run this year, but it has improved vastly the last two weeks against running teams. The Pack allows 185.6 yards per game and 4.9 yards per carry. But in the last two weeks, Nevada is at 158 yards per game allowed and 4.0 yards per rush. Nevada has struggled against Air Force’s triple-option over the years, but this is a slightly different offense, one the Wolf Pack hasn’t faced under Brian Polian because of the MW’s unbalanced schedule (the last time these conference mates played was 2012). \nDid you know? Nevada and New Mexico faced off in the 2007 New Mexico Bowl, with the Lobos winning, 23-0. The shutout was Nevada’s first since 1980 and ended a 330-game streak without a shutout, which was the NCAA record. The Wolf Pack, led by freshman quarterback Colin Kaepernick, struggled to just 210 yards and 12 first down. Kaepernick went 13-of-31 for 137 passing yards. \nOne famous sports alum: Brian Urlacher — The most famous Lobo is Urlacher, an eight-time Pro Bowler, five-time All-Pro, the 2005 NFL Defensive Player of the Year and almost certainly a Pro Football Hall of Famer one day. A two-way player, Urlacher thrived at New Mexico under Rocky Long, now the coach at San Diego State. Urlacher had 442 tackles, 11 sacks, 11 forced fumbles and three picks and scored 11 touchdowns (six via reception; five on kick returns). He was 12th in the 1999 Heisman vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:24:00.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
