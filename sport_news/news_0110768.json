That’s shabby—don’t do it!” urged Bayern Munich sports director Matthias Sammer. \nTen days ago, the magazine Spiegel broke open a can of worms by claiming the DFB had used a slush fund to buy votes in order to host the 2006 tournament. \nSpiegel claimed the DFB borrowed 10.3 million Swiss francs (RM44.748 million) in 2002 from Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the former CEO of German sportswear giant Adidas, in order to buy the votes of four Asian members of FIFA’s 24-strong executive committee. \nGermany won the bid to stage the 2006 World Cup ahead of South Africa by 12 votes to 11, with one abstention. \nSpiegel claimed the DFB then transferred €6.7 million (RM31.395 million) to a FIFA account in 2005 to reimburse Louis-Dreyfus. \nBoth German legend Franz Beckenbauer, who was chairman of the 2006 organising committee, and Niersbach have strenuously denied the allegations. \nNo saints \nAt a hastily called press conference last Thursday, Niersbach insisted that there has never been anything shady over the 2002 payment. \nHe claimed that in 2002, FIFA president Sepp Blatter told Beckenbauer that football’s governing body could provide a 170 million euro subsidy for the tournament, if 10 million Swiss francs was provided. \n“There was no slush fund, there was no vote buying,” insisted Niersbach. \nBut Blatter, who is currently suspended by FIFA, has denied Niersbach’s claims about his conversation with Beckenbauer 13 years ago. \n“I have never demanded money from Beckenbauer. Never in my life. And also not from the DFB, that simply isn’t true,” Blatter told a Swiss newspaper yesterday. \nAnd on Friday, ex-DFB president Theo Zwanziger set the cat amongst the pigeons by accusing Niersbach of lying and said he was certain that there was a slush fund for the 2006 World Cup. \n“It is also clear that the current DFB president (Wolfgang Niersbach) knew of this already in 2005, and not only a few weeks ago as he claimed,” added Zwanziger, who headed the German FA from 2006 to 2012. \n“The way I see it, Niersbach is lying.” \nSenior figures in German football have jumped to Niersbach’s defence—and taken their chance to attack Zwanziger. \n“There is absolutely no reason to doubt Wolfgang Niersbach. In his time as DFB president, Zwanziger did a lot of damage and has now been unmasked,” said Mainz president and DFB vice-president Harald Strutz, who has been the most vocal. \nBut as Wolfgang Thierse, a former president of Germany’s Bundestag, put it: “the whole affair is not increasing the prestige of the DFB. \n“Germany is not a collection of saints, and certainly not the football association and Beckenbauer.” \nPure mafia \nFIFA has called for the DFB to co-operate with its investigation into the cash-for-votes allegations, but the unsavoury matter is unlikely to be resolved quickly and has cast a shadow over German football as a whole. \nAs Wolfsburg’s sports director Klaus Allofs put it “these are stories which football doesn’t need” and Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt echoed: “it is very difficult to survey the situation and I hope there is a good resolution”. \nWith Hamburg hoping to host the 2024 Olympic Games, the scandal threatens to hurt another sporting opportunity for Germany, as the bid must still pass a public referendum in the Hanseatic city on November 29. \n“Hamburg’s residents will think twice as to whether they really want to wholeheartedly say ‘yes’ to the Olympics,” Swiss IOC member Gianfranco Kasper told German daily Bild yesterday. \n“Simply because people think: ‘everything is corrupt anyway’. \n“We are all lumped together, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee). \n“I hear it everyday: ‘you’re all nothing more than just collecting money, you are pure mafia’.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:15:39.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
