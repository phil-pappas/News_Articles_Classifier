The Dolphins fired coach Joe Philbin last week. \nKaepernick, a second-round pick in 2011, took the 49ers to a Super Bowl and to the NFC title game in 2013. But the 49ers slipped to 8-8 last year and coach Jim Harbaugh , who was feuding with management, was fired. \nThis year, the wheels have come off for Kaepernick, who doesn’t have the same players around him and looks lost. He threw four interceptions against Arizona two weeks ago and that carried over in a 17-3 loss to Green Bay last week. Four times Kaepernick threw deep sideline passes out of bounds to avoid interceptions. He was picked off just once. \n“That’s something where you’re going to have that in the back of your mind,’’ Kaepernick said of the interceptions. “You protect the football.’’ \nIn the last two games, the 49ers were outscored 64-10 and Kaepernick’s passer rating was 25.6. His overall passer rating of 67.7 is third-worst in the league. He still has his job, mainly because his backup is Blaine Gabbert . \nTannehill never enjoyed the initial success Kaepernick had because the Dolphins weren’t as talented. Still, after a pair of 8-8 seasons, the Dolphins gave Tannehill a contract worth more than $19 million a year. \nThrough four games, Tannehill’s passer rating is 77.1, fifth-worst in the league, a spot behind Fitzpatrick and two above Kaepernick. \nEven worse was his last practice in London before the Dolphins were beaten by the Jets, 27-14. \nDuring a walkthrough, the defensive players showed a lack of respect for Tannehill by intercepting his passes. The defensive players are supposed to shadow the receivers as they run through the offensive game plan in a walkthrough. They aren’t supposed to disrupt it. \nTannehill reacted by saying they should get a practice squad trophy, though he denied a report that he referred to their small paychecks. The incident was quickly leaked to the news media and became a symbol of the team’s dysfunction. \nTannehill apologized for his reaction after the team returned to Miami and Philbin was fired. \nInterim coach Dan Campbell , who tried to change the culture by holding an Oklahoma drill last week, will stick with Tannehill for now because the backup is journeyman Matt Moore . A new coach next year may decide to rebuild with a new quarterback unless Tannehill starts playing better. \n\nOwner does talking \nThe Detroit Lions came up with a unique way of publicly protesting the non-call at the end of their Monday night loss to Seattle when linebacker K.J. Wright illegally batted a ball out of the end zone. \nThe NFL frowns on publicly criticizing officials, so coach Jim Caldwell said owner Martha Firestone Ford gave league officials an earful at the league meetings in New York last week. \n“Don’t think Mrs. Ford is not upset,’’ Caldwell said. “Don’t think she is just sitting around not saying anything, OK? Don’t think she doesn’t give them a piece of her mind.’’ \nShe is the widow of long-time Lions owner William Clay Ford , a grandson of Henry Ford . She’s also the granddaughter of Harvey Firestone , the Firestone tire founder. \nShe has kept a low profile since her husband died a year ago and spoke to the media in a formal setting for the first time at the start of minicamp. \nBy saying the owner was upset, Caldwell avoided risking a fine himself. \nStill, all that doesn’t change the fact that the NFL rulebook is too complicated and the officials miss too many calls. \nWright said he didn’t know it was illegal to bat the ball out of the end zone and it is not reviewable because the league considers it a “judgment’’ call. It can be a judgment call if it’s knocked out in a scrum, but Wright was by himself when he batted it out and later admitted he did it on purpose. \n\nFans need a win \nThe Jaguars’ game in Tampa Sunday is not only important to staying a game behind the Colts in the AFC South, but keeping the fan base engaged. \nA large contingent of Jaguars fans will be making the trip to Tampa, but the casual fans at home may tune them out if they don’t beat the Buccaneers. \nThe Jaguars first two games were viewed in 164,000 households and the figure spiked to 173,000 for the New England game after the Jaguars beat Miami. But only 153,000 viewed the loss to Indianapolis after the lopsided loss at New England. \nThe Jaguars need more success to keep the fans interested. \n\nCrowded at the top \nIf the Patriots beat the Cowboys on Sunday, the league will have had six 4-0 teams for the first time in league history. \nThe other five are the Falcons, Panthers, Bengals, Broncos and Packers. \nTeams that are 4-0 have a big edge in the playoff chase. Since the current playoff format started in 1990, 59 of the 71 (83 percent) 4-0 teams made the playoffs. \nBy contrast, only one 0-4 team — the 1992 San Diego Chargers — reached the postseason. The Chargers went 11-1 the rest of the way that year to make the playoffs at 11-5. \nDetroit is the only 0-4 team this year. \n\nQuotable \n“Right now he’s a one-year wonder. I’m just being honest. It’s just one year.’’ Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie on Giants receiver Odell Beckham , who has 24 catches and is on pace to top his total of 91 catches as a rookie.
