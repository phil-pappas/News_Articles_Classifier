The Panthers won 6-2. (AP Photo/LM Otero) \nDALLAS (AP) — Nick Bjugstad had a goal and an assist after moving up to the top line, and the Florida Panthers beat the Dallas Stars 6-2 on Saturday night. \nBjugstad centered a line with Jaromir Jagr and Jonathan Huberdeau because a hand injury sidelined Aleksander Barkov. He put the Panthers ahead to stay at 2-1 in the first period. \nJagr also had a goal and an assist, and Huberdeau assisted on Florida’s first two goals. \nAl Montoya made 33 saves to improve to 2-0-0. \nJamie Benn scored both Dallas goals, increasing his total to an NHL-leading eight. \nThe Stars had a five-game winning streak snapped that had included a sweep of four road games. \nFlorida’s Aaron Ekblad and Dave Bolland each scored their first goal this season.
