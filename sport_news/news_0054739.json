In the earlier meeting, the Blazers held the Jazz to 31 percent shooting and put together their best defensive game of the exhibition season. That same defensive success didn't carry over to Sunday as the Jazz shot 41 percent from the floor and made 12 of 27 shots from beyond the three-point the arc.\n\"We did a lot of good things late, but certainly the first three quarters of defense wasn't what it needed to be,\" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said.\nLillard led Portland with 32 points and six assists. The All-Star point guard had little help through three quarters as no other Blazer scored in double-digits prior to the fourth.\nLillard's backcourt partner, CJ McCollum , came alive after three quarters and led the charge in the fourth. He scored 18 of 26 points in the fourth quarter to go with nine assists and four rebounds. McCollum outscored the entire Jazz team (17 points) on his own in the fourth.\n\"I was more aggressive in the fourth quarter,\" McCollum said. \"I was being passive. I was playing soft, shooting a lot of jumpers, a lot of threes. So I tried to be more aggressive in the second half. In the fourth quarter, I tried to get to hole.\"\nMcCollum's driving layup cut the Jazz lead to 100-99 with 10 seconds left. After an intentional foul, Jazz forward Elijah Millsap made one of two free throws to give Utah a two point lead with 7.8 seconds left. On the next possession Millsap committed a non-shooting foul on Lillard 22-feet from the rim, sending the Blazers' point guard to the line for two free throws that tied the game at 101. Utah's Chris Johnson missed a leaning jumper at the buzzer to send the game into overtime.\nThe Blazers put the game away early in overtime, scoring the opening 10 points of period. The late surge was highlighted by three-pointers from Lillard and Allen Crabbe and a fast break dunk from Noah Vonleh. By the time Utah scored its first bucket with 1:30 left in overtime Blazers fans were already filing out of the arena and celebrating the comeback win.\nTrey Burke led Utah with 22 points before sitting out the final quarter. Joe Ingles had 16 points for the Jazz and hit 5 of 7 three-pointers.\nHarkless starts for Aminu\nMoe Harkless started at small forward in place of Al-Farouq Aminu. The Blazers officially said Aminu missed the game with a \"left hamstring strain\" and Stotts said he did not believe the injury was serious.\nDavis provides a spark\nEd Davis didn't have a big scoring night, finishing with nine points, but his energy on the glass (13 rebounds) and defense (four blocks and a steal) helped fuel the McCollum-led comeback push.\n\"I thought Ed Davis was very good defensively and making himself available offensive,\" Terry Stotts said. \"He and Noah (Vonleh) played well together.\"\nVonleh and Davis were the front court paring for the final seven minutes, helping the Blazers close regulation with a 23-11 push.\nJazz starters sit\nThree Jazz starers, Rudy Gobert (rest), Gordon Hayward (back contusion) and Derrick Favors (lower back), sat out Sunday night to rest a variety of ailments. Hayward injured his back in the fourth quarter of Monday's game against the Blazers when he was knocked to the court by McCollum on a fast break. McCollum was assessed a Flagrant 2 and ejected on the play.\nRodney Hood, Trevor Booker and Tibor Pleiss took the starting spots for the Jazz alongside Burke and Alex Burks.\nNext up\nThe Blazers play the Lakers in Los Angeles on Monday for their first (and only) set of back-to-back games of the preseason. The game tips at 7 p.m at Staples Center.\n-- Mike Richman\nmrichman@oregonian.com\n@ mikegrich", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mikegrich/"], "published": "2015-10-19T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:12:41.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
