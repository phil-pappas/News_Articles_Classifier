Basically, I’ll solicit questions on Twitter (@jeffphowe), and answer six on the blog every Friday. If you’re so inclined, use the #Friday6Pack hashtag and submit a question earlier in the week.\nHere we go.\nHow does the Patriots defensive line wreak havoc against the Dallas bull offensive line?\n--@Nick_Vandal87\nIt’s an imposing challenge, no doubt, as the Cowboys have the best offensive line in the game. However, in the way Tom Brady has helped the Patriots offensive line, the reputation of the Cowboys line began to take shape in 2014 when Tony Romo was healthy and DeMarco Murray was, you know, a Cowboy.\nWhat’s the NFL’s best line up to now with running backs Joseph Randle and Darren McFadden and, for the last two and a half games, Brandon Weeden at quarterback? Well, the Cowboys are ranked 16th in rushing, and their eight sacks allowed are tied with three other teams for the 15th most, so statistically, they’re exactly average in the running department. Weeden, by the way, has taken five of those sacks in just 64 drop-backs.\nThe line is good and tough to beat, but they’re sometimes only as good as the guys in charge behind them. If Chandler Jones, Rob Ninkovich, Jabaal Sheard, Dominique Easley, Dont'a Hightower and Jamie Collins continue to win one-on-one battles, they’ll drown Weeden and the backs with their rushing ability.\nWhat's the possibility of Tom Brady dropping 60 on the Colts?\n--@BryceIsRighht\nThere have been seven 60-point performances in 10,276 games since the 1970 merger, so there’s technically a 0.0006812 percent chance.\nThen again, there have been exactly zero games in NFL history in which a four-time Super Bowl champion has met a team nine months after it helped launch one of the wildest, most manufactured controversies ever in sports, which in turn caused said quarterback to attack the league as though his hair were actually on fire. So, maybe throw the record books out the window.\nWe do know this: The Patriots have scored 189 points in their last four games (47.3 points per game) against Andrew Luck’s Colts. They also scored 59 points against the Colts in 2012, but they were helped by a punt return for a touchdown and two pick-sixes.\nSince the merger, the single-game points record is 62. The Pats, who have never scored 60 points in franchise history, actually had a missed field goal and two punts in that 2012 game, so they were close.\nThe Patriots have had 43 offensive possessions in those four games against Luck’s Colts, excluding kneel-downs to close the second and fourth quarters, so they’ve averaged 3.9 points per possession (not counting the punt and interception returns). The Pats would need 16 possessions to score 62 points at that rate, and that’s not happening. But if they get 11 possessions against the Colts, they’d need to average 5.7 points per possession to make a run at the single-game scoring record. That could include nine touchdowns and two punts or eight touchdowns and three field goals (65 points), barring a defensive or special teams touchdown.\nSo now you know.\nWith this draft class and offseason additions to the defensive line, do you see Chandler Jones playing with the Patriots past his contract?\n--@tomjesusbrady\nIt’s a fair question. Jones is still signed through 2016 after the Patriots exercised his fifth-year option for $7.799 million, so the Pats already believed he was worth a considerable amount of money for one season.\nDepending how Jones’ next two seasons play out, he is probably eying a five-year contract worth between $35 million and $42.5 million in total dollars. If he blossoms into the consistent 12-sack player the Patriots would like him to become, he’d be worth the dough. Otherwise, if they can’t strike a deal and Jones heads to free agency, he’ll find more money elsewhere.\nJones’ other issue is he is scheduled to hit free agency at the same time as Jamie Collins and Dont'a Hightower, and Bill Belichick always seems to be a little more loyal to linebackers. The Patriots can afford to keep all three. It’s a matter of how much they want to keep all three.\nYou mentioned the draft class, and though Trey Flowers and Geneo Grissom have showed some potential, neither projects as the type of pass rusher as Jones. Obviously, there’s a ton of time for that to change, but I wouldn’t say Flowers or Grissom is a reason right now to move on from Jones. If teams want elite pass rushers -- and I’m not saying Jones has gotten to that point, but he has the highest ceiling of the defensive ends on the roster -- they’ve got to invest quality assets in the form of big contracts and high draft picks.\nWhat's the O-line going to look like with Ryan Wendell back?\n--@ChazSurette\nI think they’ll continue to rotate their interior linemen, and Wendell has been working at center in practice. He also can play either guard position, so he can factor into the rotation with Josh Kline, Shaq Mason and Tre’ Jackson.\nThe key question here is which lineman will sit, assuming they won’t carry eight linemen -- and five interior linemen -- on the 46-man game-day roster. It’d be Jackson if playing time is any indication, but it’s possible it could be David Andrews. Obviously, Andrews has played very well, but there’s a long-term factor in mind here. First, the Pats have invested more in fourth-rounders Mason and Jackson than the undrafted Andrews, but Belichick doesn’t care too much about draft stock when it comes to playing time.\nMore significantly, if Wendell returns to play center, Kline would be the backup, and Kline has played well, too. The Pats have to think about Bryan Stork’s return, too, because Stork and Andrews are essentially true centers. It seems like there are a million combinations here because the Patriots have so much versatility, and that’s a great problem to have. It also makes this an impossible question to answer.\nIs Scott Chandler going to be more involved in the passing game?\n--@kylearchie9\nEventually, yeah, I’d think so. Chandler was outstanding in the offseason and training camp, so there were lofty expectations for him. He has been effective in some combination patterns with Rob Gronkowski, but the Patriots would create more matchup problems if Chandler got more involved statistically. He ranks sixth on the Pats with six catches and 49 yards and he has one touchdown while ranking 14th with an average of 33 offensive snaps per game. Chandler should get it going at some point, though.\nWould the Patriots hire a punter who could only kick the ball 100 yards -- straight -- every time? Always a touchback.\n--@BobMcGovernJr\nSo, my friend Bob here has been asking this question seemingly every day for years, and I’ve finally found the data to give him an answer. It all comes from pro-football-reference.com’s drive finder sorting tools.\nBy the numbers, the answer is yes.\nThrough Week 4 in the NFL this season, teams’ average starting position after a punt has been their own 25.7-yard line. That includes 551 punts. Last season, including 2,281 possessions following a punt, the average starting position was the 25.3-yard line, so this is a consistent statistic.\nLet’s narrow it down to make it Patriots-specific. Pats opponents have started 143 drives after a Ryan Allen punt since 2013, and their average starting position has been the 24.4-yard line. So Allen is better than the league average in that regard.\nThere are other factors to consider. Of those 143 drives, 54 started inside the 20-yard line, and 17 more started right at the 20, so 49.7 percent of those punts were no worse than a touchback from a standpoint of starting field position. Would a special teams guru like Bill Belichick prefer to roll the dice to pin back his opponents, especially with a Tom Brady offense that rarely punts from deep in its own territory?\nAnd let’s say the Patriots drafted this punter. What’s his market become after four seasons? Surely, other teams would be intrigued, so there could be something of a bidding war for his services in free agency. Would Belichick want to have the game’s highest-paid kicker and punter?\nSo there are some unknowns here, but the statistics show teams would benefit by having a punter who sent his boot for a touchback 100 percent of the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:59:49.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
