I really want to get down there to just speak with the coaches again and show my face.” \nThe No. 1 recruit in the state of North Carolina according to Rivals was initially supposed to come to town for the Notre Dame game last weekend, but inclement weather canceled his trip. \n“I wasn't able to come down, but I watched it. It was a great game. They came out pretty strong and went up,” Foster said. “They held them down the whole game even though Notre Dame was able to score. In the end, they did their thing. It's good to beat a team that high in the rankings in the rain. It was really a good game.” \nEven on television, Foster could see how well Clemson's linebackers played. \n“They're all over the field. They can make plays inside and outside,” he said. “They can cover, too, if you want them to. He (Venables) has them playing almost everywhere, but when it comes to the running game they really shut it down, plus all of the defensive lineman are good up front.” \nWhen does Foster expect to make a decision, and where does Clemson stand? \n“I'll probably cut down my list at the end of this season, and I'll probably start trimming my list down slowly after that. I'll make my final decision at the Army All-American Game,” he said. “I would say that they're (Clemson) one of the teams that when I get ready to make a decision, they will be pretty high. Clemson will probably make it onto my final list.” \nWhat sets the Tigers apart from the other schools? \n“They're one of the schools that will let me major in mechanical engineering, and that's a really big thing with me,” he said. “I want to balance my schedule with classes and football. You can come in as a freshman and get on the field because they play freshmen. I really like the environment down there. Me and the coaches have a really good relationship. I really think they'll be there for a while. That's a big thing for me if a coach is going to stay there. It's a nice place and a good environment. I feel comfortable down there.” \nHis relationship with defensive coordinator Brent Venables Brent Venables View Full Profile is also a big selling point. \n“We get along well. We talk a lot back and forth through Twitter,” Foster said. “We talk on the phone every couple of weeks. When I come down, we talk a lot. We're pretty cool. It's kind of like just talking to one of your friends, that's how cool he is.” Rate this Story: Send Feedback to Nikki Hood: Email | Comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:50:44.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
