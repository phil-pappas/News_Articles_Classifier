We just had good play all around.” \nBoth teams came into the third set ready to win. Ridge reeled off four points to start but Watchung Hills quickly came back with answers. The two teams went back and forth making it impossible to predict which team would get the W. Eventually, the Red Devils found themselves with a healthy eight-point lead, but the Warriors weren’t ready to give up. They dropped four in a row before Ridge scored one. \nWith a 24-19 score in Ridge’s favor, Watchung Hills gained four points bringing the set down to the wire. It was anyone’s match, but the Red Devils capitalized on a Warriors error, sending the Ridge fans into deafening cheers. \nThe Red Devils came out strong in the first set looking far more composed and settled than their competitors. They gained six unanswered points before Warriors head coach Evan Oftedal called timeout. From that point on the Warriors began chipping away at the score, but they were too little too late. Ridge took it 25-20. \nEverything that Watchung Hills lacked in the first set, it demonstrated in the second. Good communication and a calm style of play defined it in the middle leg of the match and took Ridge by surprise, 25-21. \n“The second set (Watchung Hills) upped their level of pay,” Milot said. “I think they played a little too loose in the first set, but then they upped their game more than we did.” \nRidge senior captain Jordan Lee said that the service aid started to break down and that contributed to the second set loss. \n“We had a rough patch but we came out of it quick enough to come back for the third set,” Lee said. \nChelsea Winegar recorded six kills and 12 digs for the Red Devils while Lorin Dazzo contributed with five kills and five blocks. \nMilot believes that her team’s strongest attribute is in its veteran players. \n“Our senior leadership is really good, they’re just really showing the younger players how to play,” she said. “I think that’s the biggest thing we have going for us.” \nStaff Writer Alyssa Davis: adavis3@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1KQrYp3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:54:19.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
