He was among many members of the Yankees family who played a round or two of golf at Fall River Country Club. Skip Karam said he and the late Ed Keyes had the pleasure of playing in a foursome with Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. \"They were two regular guys,\" Karam said. \"They were funny. Yogi was yelling at guys on the course.\" Karam said Billy Martin, Catfish Hunter, Dick Howser, and Bob Lemon also teed it up at FRCC. And, of course, so did Phil Rizzuto, who was pals with former FRCC member and businessman Gus Davi. Midway through October (which, by the way, is Pit Bull Awareness Month) is a fair time to dole out some kudos, draw some conclusions, and make some observations about the local high school sports scene. Here is what pops into my mind. Top teams Bishop Connolly boys’ soccer. The Cougars are a cool 9-1-1 heading into today’s game at Westport. Case volleyball. Undefeated in the South Coast Conference, the Cardinals are 13-1 overall, the only loss to defending Division 1 state champion Barnstable and longtime coach Tom “Joe” Turco. Case volleyball sets the bar quite high, and coach Michaela Goncalves said after Tuedsay’s win at Somerset Berkley that Case’s ultimate goal is a state title. The Cardinals lost to Frontier Regional (and giant-like coach Sean MacDonald) in last year’s Division 3 championship match. Bishop Connolly football. We’ve already written a lot about the 5-0 Cougars. Somerset Berkley field hockey. The Raiders are 9-1-1. Could next month bring about a playoff clash with the mighty Porkers of Walpole High? We can only hope. Bishop Stang girls’ soccer. The Spartans (8-1-3) are another once-beaten team. Coolest name Storme Bastille, Diman girls’ cross country. Two-sport man Tyler Murray, Tiverton High. Soccer is his main sport. He’s a placekicker for football. Most hustling soccer referee (this is no knock on the other refs) Stefanie Young. Two thumbs up (four if my big toes can be counted as thumbs) for Canobie Lake Park’s Screemfest. It’s weekends (Friday-Sunday). The rides open at 1 p.m, and the ghoulie parade and fun-scary haunted house stuff starts at 6 p.m. The long haunted house lines moved much faster than I expected. Check out Kevin O'Connor's story on Bill \"Spaceman\" Lee serving as keynote speaker at the SouthCoast Business Expo. Lots of interesting observations from the former Red Sox lefty.
