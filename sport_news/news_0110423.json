He continued to drive on three flat tires and eventually he lost control,” said Lacey police sergeant Terence Brimmer.\nHe drove the car up onto a curb and got stuck. Police pulled him from the driver’s seat and took him into custody.\nStephanie Thomas says it was frightening to watch the whole thing happen in a school parking lot with students inside classrooms.\n“It was just a really scary situation. I’m sure the kids are just a little shook up, but I don’t think they were in any type of danger,” said Thomas.\nNorth Thurston high was ordered into lockdown during the incident. School officials said there was no known threat made against the school itself.\nLacey police said the driver’s motive was still under investigation.\nIn April, a teacher saved students’ lives when he tackled a high school student with a gun. The student fired a shot before Brady Olson tackled him and held him down. No one was injured, including the gunman, because of Olson's actions.\nOlson humbly talked about what happened that day.\n\"I think I saw a weapon -- he fired it already. My first thought was, “Keep him from firing again,’” said Olson.\nThough he didn't have training and he wasn’t aware he was using the technique, Olson performed a tactic known as Run, Hide, Fight that teaches alternatives to simply locking down in the event of an armed intruder.\\\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
