By JOSHUA PEACOCK The Massie Heritage Center is offering up a haunted tour this October that’s a little bit different than the typical Savannah fare.\nInspired by a myriad of other such tours in the city, The Massie Center wanted to give visitors and natives a ghostly tour that focuses on the true history surrounding the more “haunted” domiciles and squares in the Historic District.\nGuide Rachel Bradshaw, a heritage specialist at the Massie Center, sticks to the history during the hour-and-a-half Historic Homes and Haunts Walking Tour while ephemerally passing into stories of paranormal activity.\n“In the spirit of Halloween and all the ghost tours that we see every day and all day long drive around us, we decided to do our own version of a ghost tour and talk about the historic homes that may or may not be haunted in Savannah, as well as some of the more haunted squares in Savannah,” Bradshaw said.\nThe tour begins at the Massie Heritage Center and then travels in a square around several different squares, stopping intermediately at particular homes, monuments and inside squares that offer not only great history, but haunted stories as well.\nThe route explores an area just around the Massie Heritage Center in the southern side of the Historic District, which just so happens to include some of the more interesting history, beautiful structures and ghost stories in Savannah.\n“The Massie Heritage Center is a heritage center, and our entire mission is to educate visitors, locals and school children alike on the history of Savannah,” Bradshaw said. “Savannah just happens to have a haunted history and a dark past. That’s still a part of history, so it’s worth exploring as well.”\nAfter the first of two walks scheduled this month, last Tuesday’s group, comprised of both tourists and locals, all admitted to learning a new fact or story they had not previously known. Along with the picturesque background, this is the best trait of The Massie Center’s tour.\nBradshaw has done an excellent job in the research for this tour, and even the most seasoned Savannahian or native will probably be surprised to hear a few of the anecdotes from her proverbial quiver.\nDo you know what is considered the most haunted square in Savannah, and why? Perhaps, more interesting than ghostly happenings is the fact that on that bloody square, two of the greatest Civil War generals stayed in houses literally a stone’s throw apart, at different times during the war.\nBradshaw’s research has debunked some ghost stories currently being told about a certain house in disrepair. Turns out, the house is just in disrepair. No bloody massacre has ever been recorded there, according to Bradshaw’s research.\n“I chose the buildings that had the highest level of history and some of the more common ghost stories,” Bradshaw said. “I knew there would be some locals, but also a lot of visitors. We are touring a little farther from River Street, and in a different section of town, so I wanted to give a complete tour of the area. I wanted to choose some of the more historic homes and prominent ghost stories.”\nTAKE PART\nThe second and final Historic Homes and Haunts Walking Tour will take place at 5 p.m. Oct. 27. Interested parties can call ahead to make reservations at 912-395-5070, or email rachel.warren@sccpss.com .
