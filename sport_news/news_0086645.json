Drive out in any direction and you encounter views of valleys, flatland, erosion sites, hills and fading mountains in the distance. To say that Cappadocia is a ‘unique’ or ‘different’ region is to put things mildly. A 250 sq km region in Central Anatolia, comprising flatland, valleys, cliffs, hills and volcanoes, Cappadocia is the common name of the field covered by the provinces of Aksaray, Nevsehir, Nigde, Kayseri and Kirsehir in the Central Anatolian region in Turkey. In the Bronze Age, Cappadocia was the population zone of the Assyrian civilisation, and later hosted the Hittite, Frig, Pers, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman civilisations. The first Christians who escaped from the persecution of the Roman Empire in the second century came and settled in Cappadocia. Relics of ancient history lie scattered around the region embellishing the visitor’s experience. Little has changed in the region’s basic structure, except the development of its major towns — Nevsehir, Urgup, Avanos, Uchisar and Kaymakli. Definitely worth a visit are the region’s main attractions — the Goreme Open Air Museum; underground cities, besides the cave dwellings. The world comes to Cappadocia to see natural scenic wonders. Volcanic eruptions in the region formed a large tableland and the combination of the volcanic tufas, the erosion of the Kizilirmak River and wind erosion over millions of years have created chimney rocks — Fairy Chimneys as these are sometimes referred to. It was a simple matter of the wind and water eroding the soft volcanic rock and chiselling it into its present shape. While Fairy Chimneys are scattered loosely all over the region, an excellent place to see these symbols of natural phenomenon is in the Monk’s Valley that has dozens of prime examples. The highlight of your visit could be taking in the sheer beauty and intensity of the Goreme National Park and Open Air Museum, a major tourist site well worth the effort. Located just outside the village of Goreme, 12 km from Nevsehir and in the heart of Cappadocia, the park’s valleys are prime Fairy Chimney country. Myriad rock faces stare down at you and the climb to its various vantage points present spectacular views of the rock face and the valleys below. Dozens of ancient frescoes are the hallmark of the local church. Complimenting the fascinating landscape is an assortment of important Byzantine churches that reflect the history of religious art in that period. Monastery life in the area began in the third and fourth centuries, and grew quickly. You find the remains of monuments, churches, chapels, dining halls, monk cell alcoves, depots, and wine production places all decorated with frescoes. The nearby villages of Urgup, Avcilar, Uchisar, Cavusini and Yeni Zelve still reflect traditional life and agricultural practices of Goreme’s past. Kaymakli underground city, a World Heritage Site, compels you to bend your back. Literally! Built by the early Christians to escape persecution of the Roman soldiers, it’s a labyrinth of tunnels that connect rooms, churches, living quarters, granaries, stables, kitchens, wine cellars, and shrines, all clustered around the carefully located ventilation shafts and wells. Depending on your interest in natural wonders, you could stay in the region from three to five days in order to see all the sites. And don’t be surprised if you find that time has passed rather more quickly than you’d imagined it to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:19:30.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
