It was a tough day to be a Bethel Thresher Oct. 17, as the Sterling Warriors charged into North Newton and handed Bethel a 47-7 loss. “We have to get better, we are a young team,” said head coach Morris Lolar. “We have 11 or 12 seniors, and everyone is still feeling out the coaching staff.” Bethel struggled in every phase of the game — offense, defense and special teams. Defensively Bethel struggled to stop Sterling’s read option, at one point allowing Warrior quarterback Cedrick Phillips to carry the ball on nine out of 10 plays from scrimmage including the first two touchdowns of the game. “He is a good quarterback and he is a freshman and we will see him again,” Lolar said. “I make no bones about it, we will play against him next year … it will be a more competitive game.” Sterling scored the first 41 points of the game before the Bethel offense was able to break through on the scoreboard. Bethel put together a four play, 37 yard drive in the fourth quarter than ended with a Preston Oliver touchdown with 11:28 to play. Unfortunately for the Threshers, the game was decided before the offense was able to start making noise. “We need to grow and get into the weight room. We are not very strong. We can’t spot people points,” Lolar said. Official statistics were unavailable due to technical issues during the game.
