He’s in his first year on the job, but his welcome to town came at none other than Hopper’s. \n“When I first took the job here, this is where we came every Sunday,” Drehle said. “We were driving back and forth from Jefferson City and this is where we ate every Sunday.” \nThe support isn’t something kept just inside the walls, either. Lebioda plans to deck out the storefront for the Homecoming parade later this week. \n“Our Tiger flags are flying high in downtown Waynesville,” she said. “The opposing team coming in, whoever it would be, sees that and just fears us because the spirit is alive.” \nThe Tigers can use that backing on Friday. They’re 2-4 on the year, but just a game back of the Lakers in the district standings. A win would help their playoff position immensely. \n“It’s just going to be a confidence booster,” said senior lineman Sam Roberts. “It’s just going to make us better for the weeks to come.” \nFueling up those Tigers are the famous burgers from Hopper’s. Ursula is in the middle of a “How many ways can Ursula make a burger?” challenge, and on this particular day, was featuring the Polish burger. \nIt starts with a giant burger patty, then Ursula—whose parents are Polish, and Polish was her first language—tops it with sautéed Polish sausage, grilled onion, cheddar cheese and spicy mustard. \nCheck out the video above to see the finished product. \nUrsula and the rest of the crew at Hopper’s hopes they can fuel up the Tigers to a win Friday, in this week’s Taste of the Town.
