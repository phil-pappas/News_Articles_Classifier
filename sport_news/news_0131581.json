When career backup Reto Berra is shutting you out, you know you've got issues.\nQuote: OF THE NIGHT\n“Obviously it’s pretty disappointing for everybody. The fans, the players. There’s nobody in this organization that’s happy right now.”\n- Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau on their 0-3-1 start.\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT\n- The Ducks have been shut out twice in three losses and have only one regulation goal in 185 minutes. They’ve held a lead in just six minutes and 42 seconds of that time.\nPLAYER OF THE GAME\n- You have to hand it to Berra. Avalanche coach Patrick Roy shook things up by sitting healthy – and struggling – starter Semyon Varlamov and giving his little-used backup his first start of the season. Berra left a number of rebounds early on but made all the key saves when he had to, stopping 35 in all. Entering the game, the Swiss netminder had an NHL record of 14-22-5, 2.91 goals-against average and a .901 save percentage.\nANALYSIS\n- Is this rock bottom? Or maybe are the Ducks starting to pull out of their season-opening tailspin? Sometimes the result doesn’t accompany the effort when a losing streak needs to be stopped and the Ducks skated better, worked harder and put up far more of a test than Wednesday’s no-show against Arizona. But they’re obviously still not scoring and it’s up to their two biggest guns, Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry, to generate more offense and lead them out of this scoreless mess. Goalie Frederik Andersen gave up a bad goal to Nathan MacKinnon in the first period but he hasn’t been the problem.\nKEY MOMENT\n- Facing a two-goal deficit in the second, Getzlaf had two prime chances that he’d bury in many cases. One was stopped by Berra and the other grazed off the left post. Hagelin then followed with another try that caught some metal. It was a sequence that defined their current goal-scoring troubles.\nANY NEWS?\n- Ducks defenseman Simon Despres did not play the third period after suffering an unspecified upper-body injury in the second. Despres played five shifts in the second and Boudreau did not have an update afterward.\nMORE POSTGAME Quote: S\nCARL HAGELIN\n(on being one of four winless teams remaining …)\n“It’s definitely not the start we wanted. But it is what it is. We can’t think back now. We got to just focus on next game. Think forward, stay positive. We have a lot of great players in here. We know we can make plays. We know we can score goals. We just got to make sure we’re playing the right way.”\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-anaheimducks.logo.jpg.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-anaheimducks.logo.jpg.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:29:36.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
