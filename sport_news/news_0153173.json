Juventus said these were \"due to a benign cardiac arrhythmia (atrial flutter) which later stopped of its own accord.\" \nThe club said the 31-year-old Lichtsteiner underwent tests which led to \"a cardiac ablation operation\" on Friday. \nThe Switzerland defender \"is expected to return to competitive action within 30 days.\" \nLichtsteiner will miss Switzerland's Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia, several Italian league games and a Champions League match against Borussia Moenchengladbach. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:52:57.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
