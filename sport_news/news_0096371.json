The top 25 players on the Web.com Tour regular-season money list earned PGA Tour cards. They are competing against each other for tour priority, with regular-season earnings counting in their totals. The other players are fighting for 25 cards based on series earnings. \nGibson was 33rd on the Web.com Tour regular-season money list and entered the week 24th on the series money list with $33,942. \nLucas Glover, Sam Saunders and Mexico's Oscar Fraustro were tied for second. \nGlover, the 2009 U.S. Open chammpion, was 147th in the FedEx Cup standings and is 20th on the series with $38,991. Saunders, Arnold Palmer's grandson, was 137th in the FedEx Cup standings and is 17th on the series list with $46,950 — more than enough to lock up a PGA Tour card. Fraustro was 186th in the FedEx Cup standings and missed the cuts in the first three series events. \nLast year, Eric Axley took the 25th card with $36,312. \nSweden's Henrik Norlander won the series opener in Indiana, and Chez Reavie took the second event in North Carolina, and Andrew Loupe won last week in Ohio. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:03:21.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
