McHugh (1-0) allowed four hits, including a pair of solo homers by Kendrys Morales, while pitching around a 49-minute rain delay. Tony Sipp, Will Harris and Oliver Perez got the game to Luke Gregerson, part of Oakland's wild-card collapse in Kansas City last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:39:11.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
