Posted: Tuesday, October 6, 2015 12:51 am Norton, DHS gets past Normal West BY JIMMY HARRIS sports@dancomnews.com Commercial-News.com \nDANVILLE â€” Ethan Norton scored the winning goal on a counter attack goal with a breakaway after the Danville defense stopped a charge from Normal West to get the win 2-1 on Saturday in Big 12 Conference action. \n\"Our defense did a good job of a quick counter and I was out in front made a quick move got free and put the ball in goal,\" Norton said.. \nThis Vikings win moves them into second place in the Big 12 Conference and prepares them for the final push of the regular season. \n\"I like how well we played and we are getting better each game which is because of the hard work these guys are putting in,\" said Vikings coach Chris Griffin. \nAt the 52-minute mark, there was a penalty against Normal West and Caleb Griffin had an opportunity to break the 0-0 tie. Griffin sized up the goalie and put the ball in the back of the net and put the Vikings up 1-0. \n\"I had the opportunity to make sure we got the lead and I really like the pressure of the penalty shot and I made the shot,\" said Caleb Griffin. \nNorton scored his breakaway goal at the 60-minute mark to put Danville up 2-0 with 20 minutes to play. \n\"The defensive effort led by Kenny Heckler and Damien Landon and others was very good today,\" Chris Griffin said. \nKendl Gulick did a good job in goal as he only allowed one goal and made some great plays to keep Normal West from scoring more. \n\"We really had good communication today and our defense was good and that took some pressure of me,\" Gulick said. \nIn the first half ,the Vikings stayed aggressive as the strong wind was behind them but couldn't get a goal as it was 0-0 at half. \n\"We had to be strong and attack early because of the wind and we had some opportunities but didn't capitalize early,\" Chris Griffin said. \nNormal West got a goal at minute 62 as a crowd of players were in front of the goal and they snuck it past Gulick. \n\"We did a good job of communicating, unfortunately they scored with a good play from Normal West,\" Chris Griffin said. \nDanville improves to 12-4-2 overall and 7-1-0 in conference play. They play at Mahomet-Seymour on Tuesday. Thursday is Senior night with 11 players being recognized, and it is also the Cancer awareness game against Champaign Central. \nOver a thousand cancer awareness t-shirts have been sold and a big crowd is expected. \n\"The Vikings will be playing their game in pink uniforms to show support against cancer,\" Chris Griffin said.
