He screamed for a good 30 seconds, pointing to his heart and to the crowd and to the scoreboard while telling his team it better turn things around. And boy did Nevada do that, scoring 30 of the game’s next 33 points. \n“They kicked it into gear right after that,” Jackson said. “I’m happy that’s the way it went down.” Wolf Pack grades: Defense, special teams pave way for win \nThe Wolf Pack pushed past its sluggish start to score a 30-20 homecoming-game victory over Hawaii before 19,992 fans at Mackay Stadium. And while Jackson didn’t put up huge stats in the win – he rushed for 61 yards on 20 carries – his sideline speech seemed to spark the lethargic-looking Wolf Pack.
