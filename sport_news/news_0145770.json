Donald Duane Pietsch July 18, 1936 — Sept. 29, 2015 Donald Duane Pietsch, 79, left his family early Tuesday morning. Don was born July 18, 1936, in Kasson, Minnesota, to Rachel and William Pietsch. He attended St. Mary’s High School in Phoenix, and then moved to Florida. He married Mary Lou Porter and had three amazing children. Don was a natural entrepreneur and salesman, and he worked his way up from pumping gas to becoming a successful businessman. He married Mary Frances in 1973 and gained three beautiful daughters. They lived in Walnut Creek, California, until Don retired in 1989. They then moved into the retirement community of Arnold, California. After residing in Arnold for 15 years, they moved to Yuma, Arizona. Don had a huge heart, and was always there to help his friends and offer his love and support. If you knew him, you loved him. He was often referred to as “the best friend anyone could have,”“my big brother,” and “a true blessing in our life.” Don enjoyed the food, the new friends he would make and the cocktails he discovered along the many roads he traveled. Donald is survived by his mother, Rachel Kusche; his sister, Deanna Mathis; his brothers, Larry Kusche, Jeff Kusche and Mike Kusche; his daughter, Syndi Rutt (Lee), son, David Pietsch (Gloria), daughter, Kathy Whitehouse, daughter, Dawn Camarillo (Rudy), daughter, Judy Aiken (Mark), and daughter, Sara O’Neil (Duffy); 15 grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild, and his beloved dog, Precious. Donald was an amazing and much-loved father and friend to all. A large hole is left in the hearts of all he left behind.
