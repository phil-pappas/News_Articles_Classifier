There was no time to think about the transition from being Notre Dame ’s backup quarterback to its full-time starter.\nThere was no time for emotion, either. Not when Malik Zaire’s ankle broke gruesomely under the weight of a Virginia defender. Not after Zaire was carted off the field, his season over, and Kizer, who spent last season as an understudy to Zaire and Everett Golson, suddenly took over.\nA version of that scene has played out six times at Notre Dame this season. After losing cornerback Shaun Crawford to a torn anterior cruciate ligament and defensive tackle Jarron Jones to a torn mediate cruciate ligament in preseason camp, the Irish have absorbed one injury after another.\n College Football Games to Watch This Weekend OCT. 2, 2015 For U.A.B.

Zaire, who took over as the starting quarterback after Golson transferred to Florida State, was lost in the second game. Tight end Durham Smythe (knee) went down in the same game, then safety Drue Tranquill tore his A.C.L. after crumpling to the ground while celebrating a pass breakup in Notre Dame’s win over Georgia Tech in the third game of the season.\nPhoto Running back C.J.

Credit Joe Robbins/Getty Images Despite all of that, the No. 6-ranked Irish (4-0) have soldiered on, undeterred, heading into a showdown at No. 12 Clemson (3-0) on Saturday night. Coach Brian Kelly’s next-man-in mantra has become less of a cliché and more of a battle cry for the Irish, who despite their injuries plan to remain a factor in college football’s national championship playoff picture.\n“All of those had an impact in some fashion,” Kelly said of the injuries this week, “but it didn’t impact the bottom line. And the bottom line was that they were going to come back the next day and they were going to welcome that next person into the role they needed to excel in.”\nKelly, in his fifth season in South Bend, talks in terms of mission on an idyllic Notre Dame campus where tradition is found in century-old buildings, archways and golden domes.\n OPEN Graphic Graphic: 2015 Heisman Trophy Watch Notre Dame’s mission has been handed off to Kizer and running back C.J. Prosise, who has averaged 150 rushing yards a game since taking over for Folston. Kizer has guided the Irish to wins over Virginia, Georgia Tech and Massachusetts. He has done so by embracing the responsibility of always being on the ready — without the time to “even feel bad” for the player he replaced.\n“Coach Kelly — as much as he preaches next man in — preaches even more about preparation,” Kizer said, “and in order to be the next man in and be successful with what you’re doing, if you’re preparing like that before that, then the transition period doesn’t last as long and you’re able to get into a groove and get things rolling.”\nSaturday’s road challenge in Death Valley thrusts Kizer, Prosise and the other new starters into key roles in hostile and uncharted territory. It’s an environment Kizer will experience for the first time as a starter; he made last year’s trip to Florida State, another tough place to play, as Notre Dame’s third-string quarterback.\nPhoto Coach Brian Kelly and the No. 6-ranked Irish (4-0) have a showdown at No. 12 Clemson (3-0) on Saturday night.

But the Irish understand that injuries cannot be an excuse for not meeting the standard.\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nThat has required Zaire, Folston, Smythe and Notre Dame’s other injured starters to take on mentoring roles, insuring there is no drop-off at the six positions impacted the most by injury.\nKelly credits the lost starters for embracing both that new responsibility and his Mission mentality. Had they not, Kelly said, his job would become increasingly more difficult. But because of the trust between starters and reserves, the Irish have thus far remained on track for reaching the season’s final two games — the national semifinal and championship — which are permanent fixtures on the Irish football schedule posted in a team meeting room inside the Guglielmino Athletics Complex, where the program’s six Heisman Trophy statues and a statue of the Four Horsemen reside in the hallway.\n“You don’t know when your chance is going to come,” said senior linebacker Joe Schmidt, whose first action came about in 2012 when a starter was injured but whose 2014 season ended abruptly because of a torn A.C.L. “The older guys really work with the younger guys to make sure they’re ready for their chance.”\nSchmidt added: “All we care about is the team, and it’s not about one guy.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/03/sports/03NOTREDAMEweb3/03NOTREDAMEweb3-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/05/sports/ncaafootball/heisman-watch-1409953614405/heisman-watch-1409953614405-master180.jpg", "http://a1.nyt.com/assets/article/20151001-160749/images/foundation/logos/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/02/sports/02UABweb1/02UABweb1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/03/sports/03CAPSULESweb/03CAPSULESweb-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/03/sports/03NOTREDAMEweb2/03NOTREDAMEweb2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/28/sports/28TRACY/28TRACY-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/03/sports/03NOTREDAMEweb3/03NOTREDAMEweb3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/03/sports/03NOTREDAMEweb2/03NOTREDAMEweb2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/sports/DOG-campus/DOG-campus-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:23:20.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
