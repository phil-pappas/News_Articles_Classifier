Georgia Tech won 22-16.\nBack | Next Georgia Tech linebacker Tre’ Jackson runs down the field as Georgia Tech defensive back Lance Austin scores a touchdown to beat Florida State on Saturday.\nMike Stewart/The AP\nBy PAUL NEWBERRY\nATLANTA — Call this one Kick Six, The Sequel.\nIt may have ended Florida State’s national championship hopes.\nLance Austin returned a blocked field goal 78 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the game, giving Georgia Tech a stunning 22-16 upset of the No. 9 Seminoles on Saturday night.\nRoberto Aguayo, one of the most accurate kickers in the country, attempted a 56-yard field goal to win the game for the Seminoles (6-1, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) with 6 seconds remaining. But the kick was low, and Patrick Gamble managed to get a hand on it.\nWhile most of the Georgia Tech players celebrated, Austin went back to retrieve the ball, rolling along inside the 25-yard line.\nAt first, he seemed hesitant to pick it up. But then he did, taking off the other way in front of the Georgia Tech bench. He avoided Aguayo’s diving attempt, then cut back on the final guy who had a shot at the tackle to win the game for Georgia Tech (3-5, 1-4).\nThe white-clad Georgia Tech fans stormed the field at Bobby Dodd Stadium, celebrating with the players after perhaps the most improbable win in school history.\nThe fans were still milling around when a replay of the final play, complete with the call by the Yellow Jackets’ radio crew, was played on the video board.\nThey cheered wildly as Austin zigzagged down the field all over again on the big screen at the opposite end of the stadium.\nIn a finish reminiscent of Auburn running back a missed field goal to beat Alabama two seasons ago — the original Kick Six — Georgia Tech snapped a five-game losing streak and dealt a devastating blow to Florida State’s title hopes.\nThe Yellow Jackets also ended FSU’s record-tying streak of 28 straight victories against ACC opponents, a run that dated back to 2012 and matched the Seminoles’ streak of winning its first 28 conference games after joining the league in 1992.\nLeading 16-13, Florida State had a chance to seal the victory in the fourth quarter as it drove deep into Georgia Tech territory. On third-and-goal from the 10, Everett Golson’s deflected pass led to the Seminoles’ first offensive turnover of the season — and first turnover of any kind since their first game.\nJamal Golden made the interception in the back of the end zone, an omen of what was to come for the Seminoles.\nJustin Thomas, who had a 60-yard touchdown run for the Yellow Jackets after two early interceptions led to 10 points for Florida State, kept the game alive by converting on fourth-and-six from the Georgia Tech 41. The quarterback hit Benedictine grad Brad Stewart on a 36-yard pass that set up Harrison Butker’s third field goal of the game, a 35-yarder that tied the game with 54 seconds left.\nFlorida State still had time to get into field goal range for Aguayo. But the Seminoles didn’t get quite close enough, forcing him to attempt what would have been the longest kick of his career. He drove it low, looking for distance, and the Seminoles didn’t even get to go to overtime.\nAustin made sure of that.\nFlorida St. 3 13 0 0—16\nGeorgia Tech 3 7 3 9—22\nFirst Quarter\nFSU_FG Aguayo 20, 7:14.\nGaT_FG Butker 53, 2:38.\nSecond Quarter\nFSU_D.Cook 2 run (Aguayo kick), 11:46.\nFSU_FG Aguayo 27, 4:18.\nGaT_Thomas 60 run (Butker kick), 2:22.\nFSU_FG Aguayo 38, :00.\nThird Quarter\nGaT_FG Butker 40, 8:27.\nFourth Quarter\nGaT_FG Butker 35, :54.\nGaT_Lan.Austin 78, :00.\nA_55,000.\nFSU GaT\nFirst downs 17 15\nRushes-yards 24-70 49-261\nPassing 210 67\nComp-Att-Int 20-31-1 4-10-2\nReturn Yards 64 13\nPunts-Avg. 4-50.0 3-38.3\nFumbles-Lost 1-0 0-0\nPenalties-Yards 6-45 5-41\nTime of Possession 25:09 34:51\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING_Florida St., D.Cook 17-82, Golson 7-(minus 12).\nGeorgia Tech, Thomas 13-88, M.Marshall 16-69, Lynch 6-52, Willis 7-29, M.Allen 4-15, Lands-Davis 3-8.\nPASSING_Florida St., Golson 20-30-1-210, Team 0-1-0-0.
