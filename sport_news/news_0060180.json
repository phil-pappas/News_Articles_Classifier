Riley Harwood says police were called Saturday night after a stranger — who may have been on drugs — crashed the wedding at the Santa Barbara Carriage Museum.\nHarwood says guests evicted him. But during a confrontation with two arriving officers, he punched one in the face and bit his shoulder, then bit a police dog on the leg. The confused dog also bit an officer.\nHarwood says after he was handcuffed, the man attacked a third officer.\nTwo officers were treated for various injuries.\nHarwood says the man was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries and will be arrested when he's released.\nCopyright The Associated Press\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:17:42.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
