He knew he was going to take his game to the college level, but in order to avoid any distractions, he put off choosing a school until his senior season ended.\nWith a successful campaign in the books, McCoy took his time and committed to Marist on Feb. 12, nearly a week after college-bound student-athletes are allowed to begin signing letters of intent. He made the decision after visiting a handful of schools including Albany, Wagner, Wesleyan and Monmouth.\nJoining the Red Foxes was a choice that came naturally, McCoy said, and now he's focused on proving himself in the MAAC. Here, he talks about his decision:\n\"Marist was great: the scouts, the coaches, the area, everything was perfect. I fell in love with the environment there. I felt the program is moving in the right direction and I think I can contribute right away. They run the same offense as (Fordham Prep), so I know it well, I know the plays and the blocking schemes; usually, that's the toughest part about going to a new school.\n\"I've known (Marist coach Jim Parody) since I was a sophomore. I got the feeling that they wanted me from the beginning, I felt they would take care of me there. Camp starts in August and I'm already working hard to prepare.\n\"I'm so ready, all the hard work I've put in, I've been working with college players and coaches, and I know I'm ready.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:00:19.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
