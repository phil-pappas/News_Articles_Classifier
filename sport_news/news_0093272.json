The tour will witness India playing the first two games against New Zealand A followed by four matches against the national team. After winning the series against France and Spain recently during their tour of Europe, India have been working on different aspects of the game during the training camp that recently culminated in New Delhi. India’s high performance director and chief coach Roelant Oltmans said his wards are ready for the “Kiwi challenge”. “Every day and every game is new. We have started benchmarking ourselves and we will ensure that we go a notch higher with each game,” Oltmans said. “This is important, keeping the upcoming tournaments in mind. Not every day do we have the opportunity to play big tournaments and to be in contention we have to start challenging ourselves and be our own competition.” “The boys are not going to take tomorrow’s match lightly as it will set the tone for the upcoming matches. The team is looking good and ready to accept the Kiwi challenge,” the Dutchman added. Manpreet Singh has returned to the squad following an injury and the Punjab midfielder will be a big boost for India, captained by centre-half Sardar Singh. He is also considered as a very effective resource to link the forward line and defence. The forward line will have potent strikers in experienced S.V. Sunil, Akashdeep Singh, Ramandeep Singh and Nikkin Thimmaiah. Penalty-corner specialists Rupinder Pal Singh and V.R. Raghunath, along with Birendra Lakra and Kothajit Singh, will form the defence line. Commenting on the team’s preparation, Sardar stated: “It is very important to start a tour on a winning note as it gives you confidence for the rest of the matches. The team is working on the grey patches before the Hockey World League (HWL) Finals, so playing against New Zealand is surely going to help us in our preparations.” — IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:23:31.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
