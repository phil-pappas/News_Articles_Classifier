Jacob deGrom won the NLDS clincher against the Dodgers because, well, who else? Mets LI's Matz gets call for Game 4 \nThis is Matz's turn to join the party and make the leap from a promising 24-year-old phenom with a lesser resume than his buddies to a fully accredited member of the club. \nCan he do it? Of course he can. He was 4-0 in the regular season and pitched creditably in Game 4 of the NLDS in a game the Mets lost to an on-his-game Clayton Kershaw. No shame in that. \nNow he will be asked to go a solid five or six or maybe even seven innings, hand over the ball to what has been a reliable bullpen and then turn his attention to the many questions that could arise here late Wednesday night. \nFor example: Will the Mets require snorkeling equipment to avoid drowning in champagne in a visitors' clubhouse so small it's a wonder Babe Ruth fit into it for the 1932 World Series? \nAnd, speaking of champagne-related questions, do the 1908 Cubs make like the '72 Dolphins and pop a cork every time the modern Cubbies get eliminated, thus preserving their legacy?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:00:46.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
