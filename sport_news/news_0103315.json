Brown's action on expedited judicial reviews helps San Diego stadium effort By BERNIE WILSON AP Sports Writer   5:47   5:47   \nPeople: \nCalifornia (1459) \n\nSAN DIEGO â€” Mayor Kevin Faulconer calls it \"a huge step forward\" that Gov. Jerry Brown approved an accelerated judicial review process for any lawsuits filed against the environmental impact report for a proposed new stadium for the Chargers. \nAny lawsuit challenging the EIR must be resolved within 270 days of the city's certifying the document. The city thinks it can open a new stadium by 2019 even if there is litigation on the EIR. \nSays Faulconer: \"The governor stood up for San Diego and that's a very good thing.\" \nChargers attorney Mark Fabiani, who walked away from negotiations for a new stadium in mid-June, disagrees. Fabiani says the 270-day certification \"is unfortunately irrelevant at this point\" and the \"quickie EIR is fatally flawed.\" \nThe Chargers are eyeing a move to Los Angeles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:12:00.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
