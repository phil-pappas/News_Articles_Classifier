Given what a dominating performance the Red Devils turned in at Everton, why should he make a lot of changes? \nIf it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, right? \nHere is the Man United starting XI from Sunday: Starting XIEverton vs Manchester United #GGMU #MUFC Semoga tiga poin buat malam ini?.Amiii ?? pic.twitter.com/E6oYOlMxXy \n— Indomanutd Pekanbaru (@Indomanutd_pku) October 17, 2015 \nVan Gaal said today : “I am not stupid. I won’t change too much on Wednesday.” \nThe Dutchman dropped Memphis Depay and promoted Ander Herrera, who responded by putting in a man of the match worthy performance. Van Gaal seems to be saying that he won’t be resting any starters on Wednesday in lieu of the Manchester Derby. Therefore, you should expect to see a lineup quite similar to this. \nFor what it’s worth, The Sports Bank’s Man United starting XI prediction will be posted by very early morning. No doubt, we’ll take into account the comments Van Gaal made today. \nAs always, feel free to post what you think the Man United starting XI should be in the comments section below. \nPaul M.
