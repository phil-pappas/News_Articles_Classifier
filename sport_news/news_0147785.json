But this week he saw his name listed atop the KU depth chart at one of KU’s three receiver spots for the first time in his career. \nBecause true freshmen and red-shirt freshmen are not allowed to speak to the media this season, first-year head coach David Beaty and quarterback Montell Cozart recently were asked what transformed Patrick from a scout team wideout three weeks ago into a budding star today. \nTheir answers were very similar. \n“I’ve always had confidence in T-Pat,” Cozart said. “All camp, all spring, the guy has balled out and made big plays. He’s a great receiver and great with details. He’s been stepping up for us and I feel like he takes ownership and is just continuing to let his play talk for itself.” \nAdded Beaty: “I think the big thing that stuck out to us is what he was doing on special teams. When he wasn’t playing, he was still covering kicks for us at the gunner position and, man, he was out there showing up. He just kept working.” \nAfter not catching a pass in the season opener, the red-shirt freshman from The Woodlands, Texas, takes nine catches and 108 yards into today’s clash with Iowa State. Both numbers rank second on the team. \nEmbracing the process \nThere’s not a soul in the KU locker room who would say the Jayhawks are pleased with their 0-3 start. But the KU players and coaches are not completely devastated either. \nBecause of the persistence of the coaching staff and the character of the players, Beaty’s first Kansas team seems to be full of guys who are willing to take their lumps and embrace the rebuilding process. \nAccording to Beaty, continuing to operate that way will be critical for the Jayhawks as they navigate their way through Big 12 play during the next nine weeks. \n“There’s been a lot of progress here from the day that we got here till we started fall camp,” Beaty said this week. “But, man, we’ve got a long way to go. There’s just a lot to do. It’s like I told our team, ‘I know you want five years’ worth of work in six months, but it’s not going to happen. Doesn’t work that way.’ My mom taught me that a long time ago. Just doesn’t work that way. We have got a lot of work to do and it’s going to start with one step at a time, one day at a time, and we’ll keep sawing wood. It will hit. It will hit here soon.” \nSeries history \nToday’s game marks the 95th meeting between the Jayhawks and Cyclones on the gridiron, and KU owns a 50-38-6 advantage all-time in the series. KU won the initial meeting, 11-6, back in 1898. \nIn addition to trying to snag their first victory of 2015, the Jayhawks also are looking to put together a winning streak of Iowa State. Their 34-14 victory over ISU in Lawrence last season ended a four-game losing streak, but Iowa State has won the last three meetings in Ames. The Jayhawks are 22-22-4 all-time in games played in Ames. \nKU’s last victory at ISU’s Jack Trice Stadium came in October of 2008, when KU prevailed 35-33. \nCyclones favored \nOddsmakers in Las Vegas pegged Iowa State a 14.5-point favorite when the betting lines came out at the beginning of the week and that number has climbed steadily throughout the week and is as high as ISU -16.5 in some places. \nSo far this season, KU is 1-2 against the spread, finally covering the number during last week’s 27-14 loss at Rutgers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:59:39.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
