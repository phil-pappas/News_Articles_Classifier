Comment Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 4:16 PM By Jeff Holt Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 4:16 PM Star athletes get noticed all the time in sports - score 3 touchdowns in a game, toss in 25 points or go 4-for-4 at the plate. The next day, they quickly fill up the local sports page. Not too many sports fans have probably heard of Michael Ernst, Jimmy Flynn, Tanner Wilhelm and John Winkler. They are all seniors on the Monmouth College football team. They don't play too much, yet they play a key role in the success of the Fighting Scots. They help make those first-string players better at practice, help motivate their teammates, set a good example for the younger players and take pride in the MC grid program day in and day out. \"I think it's a lot like what David Ross brings to the Cubs,\" said MC coach Chad Braun. \"The guy does not bat for a high batting average, but he brings great team chemistry and that's what those guys do. They just don't get their names written up on the scoreboard.\" Flynn, a 6-foot-2 and 210-pound tight end from Bloomington Central Catholic, has gone through some of the toughest of times with his fellow teammates. About a year ago, right in the middle of the Monmouth College football season, Flynn's dad (Tim) died at the young age of 59. \"I got a call and had to go,\" Flynn said. \"He (Tim) went in for back surgery and they found something wrong with his lungs. Over the next three weeks, I was back and forth from here to St. Louis. About 50 players and coaches came to the visitation after practice that week, seeing all of them with their support was huge. The football team really got me through it, a huge support system. It really helped me out. It was a tough experience, but we got through it. \"I have five siblings and my mom, and we are a super tight-nit group.\" Then on Nov. 15, 2014, during Monmouth College's 38-14 victory over Carroll, Flynn caught his one and only touchdown of his Fighting Scots career. It was two weeks after his father had passed away and it was a 7-yard TD pass from quarterback Alec Dutko with 2:43 left in the third quarter. Braun added, \"It was a tremendous moment to see that happen and to get rewarded for all the tough times he's gone through.\" Ernst is a 6-4, 315-pound offensive lineman from Washington. He is majoring in political science with close to a 3.5 grade point average and hopes to one day become a Police Officer. His best advice to recruits or to first-year players is: \"Stick it out and don't quit, and don't expect to play that first year. It will probably be the best four years of your life.\" John Winkler is a 6-3, 280-pound offensive lineman from Dunlap. \"I didn't know anyone when I first got here,\" he said. \"The (Scots) football team is one big family and that's a big reason why I've stayed with football for so long because of the family atmosphere. I know that all of these guys are like my brothers. Anything I'd ever need - they would be there in a heartbeat. It's been a great four years and I wouldn't change anything for the world.\" Page 2 of 2 - Winkler added, \"I think coach Braun has done an amazing job with the coaches he's brought in.\" Last but not least is Tanner Wilhelm, a 6-foot and 220 pound linebacker from Amboy. Wilhelm is a political science major and also wants to one day become a police officer. \"It's been unbelievable experience,\" Wilhelm said. \"I don't regret anything about it. I'm not as vocal of a guy, but I like to lead by example ... kind of help the younger guys out and teach them what it means to be a Fighting Scot. Our group is usually together and that's what's really about, the friendships you build and the relationships.\" Flynn, Ernst, Winkler and Wilhelm are often at dinner at a local restaurant on Friday after practice. You might also see them tailgating with their families after a home game. And with this group of 25 seniors, these four players have left their mark on Monmouth College football.
