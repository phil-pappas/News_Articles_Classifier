Royals rally to even series, 1-1 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Kansas City, Mo.\nThe Kansas City Royals whipped out the same formula that carried them to last year's World Series to turn back the Houston Astros and tie their AL Division Series at a game apiece.\nSome clutch hitting. Stingy defense. An unflappable bullpen.\nEven a little help from replay.\n\"Just battling,\" first baseman Eric Hosmer said. \"That's what this team does so well.\"\nThe Royals rallied from a three-run deficit Friday, getting a go-ahead single from Ben Zobrist in the seventh inning, and then watched Wade Davis and the bullpen make it stand up in a 5-4 victory that brought back memories of their nip-and-tuck postseason of a year ago.\nThe Royals knotted the game at 4 off Scott Kazmir and relievers Oliver Perez and Josh Fields in the sixth. Kansas City took the lead in the seventh when Alcides Escobar led off with a triple against Will Harris (0-1) and Zobrist followed with his single through the left side.\nKelvin Herrera (1-0) and Ryan Madson each tossed a scoreless inning for the Royals, and Davis came on to close it — though the real drama was only beginning.\nDavis walked Preston Tucker with one out, and speedy Carlos Gomez came in as a pinch-runner. Davis snapped a throw to Hosmer at first, and he neatly snagged it on one hop as Gomez made a dive back to the bag. Gomez was initially ruled safe, but the call was overturned upon review.\n\"That play that Hos made on the pickoff, I don't know if there's a lot of first basemen that can make that play,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"It was tremendous.\"\nJose Altuve then grounded out to end it, giving Davis the save.\nIt was a crucial victory considering what awaits Kansas City in Game 3 on Sunday: Astros ace Dallas Keuchel, who was 15-0 at home this season. Edinson Volquez will start for Kansas City.\nRangers 6, Blue Jays 4 (14): Backup infielder Hanser Alberto singled home the go-ahead run in the 14th inning and Texas beat Toronto for a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five American League Division Series. The underdog Rangers will try to sweep the Blue Jays at home in Game 3 on Sunday. Martin Perez will start for Texas against Marco Estrada . Alberto, batting last and only in the lineup because star third baseman Adrian Beltre was out with a strained back, made an error that led to Toronto's first two runs. He delivered an RBI single with two outs in the 14th, and Delino DeShields followed with an infield hit for another run. Alberto, a 22-year-old rookie who made his big-league debut this season, also had a sacrifice fly. Texas shut out the highest-scoring team in the majors after the fifth inning. The victory for first-year manager Jeff Banister 's team made road clubs 5-0 in the playoffs so far — the only previous time that happened in the postseason was the 1906 all- Chicago World Series , STATS said. Keone Kela (1-0) worked one inning for the win, staying calm after a dustup with Toronto slugger Josh Donaldson . Ross Ohlendorf , with an old-school, double-armed windup, finished for a save. Mike Napoli hit a tying single for Texas in the eighth. Toronto lost for the second straight day at home.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/36/8767418/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/36/8767418/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:20:06.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
