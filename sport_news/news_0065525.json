They added another touchdown 15 second later after Brunswick fumbled away the kickoff. \nGreg Williams ran 15 yards for the second touchdown, but the PAT failed after it was backed up 15 yards on a personal foul call. \nCoffee ground out 293 rushing yards and quarterback Max Hughes passed for 63 more as the Trojans of coach Robby Pruitt wore down Brunswick’s defense late in the game. Coffee added two fourth quarter touchdowns on a 1-yard Tywone Brewton plunge and a 2-yard run by Milton Jackson. \nBrunswick’s lone score came in the third quarter on a 41-yard Mitchell Finneran field goal. \nBrunswick’s first year coach, Larry Harold, said his team continues to be hampered by an arm injury to starting quarterback Randon Jernigan, who lined up at flanker for most of the game. He was at quarterback only for running plays, thereby tipping Coffee off as to what the upcoming play would be. \n“It makes our offense predictable and one-dimensional,” Harold said. “They loaded up the box against us on those plays.” \nBrunswick could muster only 116 total yards, 95 rushing and 21 passing. Alonzo Brown, a sophomore filling in for Jernigan, completed 5 of 11 passes, all to junior wide receiver Shawn Smith.Jernigan led the team in rushing with 12 carries for 34 yards. \nDavis ran 8 times for 79 yards for Coffee and Williams added 69 yards on 7 carries. \nCoffee continues to be at the top of Region 3- along with Glynn Academy and Ware County with only one region loss. The Trojans stand at 7-1 overall and 5-1 in the region.. Brunswick dropped to 1-6 overall and 0-5 in the region. \nCoffee County 27, Brunswick 3 \nCC — 0 13 0 14 — 27 \nBHS — 0 0 3 0 — 3 \nCC — Demeterius Davis 22 run (Alan Martinez kick) \nCC — Greg Williams 15 run (kick failed) \nBHS — Mitchell Finneran 41 field goal \nCC — Tywone Brewton 1 run (Martinez kick) \nCC — Milton Jackson 2 run (Martinez kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:42:57.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
