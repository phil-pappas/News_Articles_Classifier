Dating is for kids,” Browne, a UFC heavyweight, explained of his relationship with Ronda Rousey during Monday’s “MMA Hour.” \n“Over the summer, through all the s–t that I had to shuffle through, that I had to sift through, Ronda and I started talking throughout the summer and I’ll say now that we are together. She’s my woman and I’m her man. There’s no boyfriend, girlfriend stuff. There’s no dating. We’re together.”\nAfter being photographed together earlier this year, rumors swirled Rousey and Browne were more than just teammates at Glendale’s Fighting Center. Browne’s wife, Jenna Renee Webb, slammed Rousey and UFC on Twitter in August, as she accused Browne of abusive behavior. \n“I expected more from her. She should be ashamed of herself,” Webb tweeted in a series of scathing posts.\nAfter Browne’s camp denied the claims — in addition to giving an update about their impending divorce — Browne is ready to move forward with his new lady love.\n“Not once did we ever think about this,” Browne said.\n“It wasn’t even a thought that went through our heads at all. So I’ve gotten to know her through the gym, through all that kind of stuff. I see her for who she is. The fact that she’s out there winning ESPYs and the star she is on the movie screen and all that kind of stuff, that’s all great. But that’s not who I know her as, if that makes sense.\n“I know her as one of the hardest working athletes that I’ve ever seen, in this gym busting her butt on a daily basis. And through our own personal experiences of how compassionate and really how much of a sweetheart she really is. That’s what a lot of people don’t see out of her. They see that, but they don’t really get to experience that.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under celebrity couples ,  ronda rousey ,  travis browne ,  ufc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:32:34.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
