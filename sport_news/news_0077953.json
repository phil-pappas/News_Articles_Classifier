The Serbian showed no mercy against the Spaniard, who was hampered by a foot problem in the second set, as he cruised to a 6-2 6-2 victory at the National Tennis Centre in the Chinese capital. “I played a great tournament overall and continued playing well today,” Djokovic said at the trophy presentation. “This definitely has been my most successful tournament in my career. I have won the Australian Open five times but Beijing has been a lucky place for me. I keep coming back here and have very positive memories.” Djokovic has now beaten Nadal in seven of their last eight meetings, dating back to the 2013 China Open, and is on the verge of levelling their head-to-head record. The pair has played each other 45 times with Nadal, who has struggled with his form and niggling injuries in the past year, hanging on to a 23-22 advantage. The world No. 8 took a medical timeout early in the second set when he hurt his right ankle but continued on, despite appearing to be in discomfort. “I hope Rafa’s foot is fine and he’s able to play next week (in Shanghai),” Djokovic said. — Reuters Muguruza beats Bacsinszky\nSpain’s Garbine Muguruza beat Switzerland’s Timea Bacsinszky to win the China Open on Sunday, her biggest title to date. Muguruza won a hard-fought final 7-5, 6-4 to capture her first Premier Mandatory title and climb to fourth in the world rankings. It was just the 22-year-old’s second WTA title, after she won her first at last year’s Hobart International, and made up for the frustration of losing her two previous finals this year, at Wimbledon in July and Wuhan last week. 29 matches Djokovic has won in a row in Beijing, and six titles in total. The 28-year-old has now 56 career titles, eight of them this year, including the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open Grand Slam crowns", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:18:29.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
