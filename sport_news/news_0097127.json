But none as sweet as the one that propelled her Kingswood Regional High School field hockey team to a 1-0 win over St. Thomas Aquinas in the first round of the Division II tournament on Wednesday. Lapar redirected a hard shot from teammate (and first cousin) Emily Skelley into the back of the cage on the Knights' first penalty corner of the afternoon less than three minutes into the contest. The lead held up to propel the eighth-seeded Knights into the quarterfinals at No. 1 Lebanon (13-1) on Saturday. \"I've had other goals like that, but they weren't as strong,\" Lapar said. \"This one felt strong. I knew I just had to get my stick there, and it felt good.\" \"I knew Meghan was going to be there,\" Skelley said. \"I ripped it right down, and she was there.\" The goal earned high praise from St. Thomas senior midfielder Reagan Williams. \"It was unstoppable,\" Williams said. \"It was a beautiful goal. Right after that, we were like, OK, well, this game isn't going to go the way we thought it was. Their offense had great block tackles and they just had really good small passes on the turf. Overall, they worked better as a team than we did.\" Kingswood (7-7-1) also scored first when the two teams met during the regular season in Dover on Sept. 22. St. Thomas came back to win that game 3-1. \"We scored first (on Sept. 22), then we let up,\" said Kingswood coach Kaitlin Reilly. \"We wanted to make sure we scored first and then show them that we're going to keep going. We wanted to end up with the higher number. That's what we talked about the other day in practice. Get the higher number.\" The No. 9 Saints finished the season 4-8-3. \"We didn't come out and play the first half of the game,\" St. Thomas coach Michaela Franey said. \"The performance was 10 times better in the second half. We at least had speed and effort.\" Kingswood dominated possession in the first half, holding a 6-2 advantage in penalty corners and a 7-2 edge in shots. St. Thomas showed a little more life in the second half, but its scoring chances were few. Williams went coast-to-coast midway through the half and was brought down in the circle, but the ensuing penalty corner did not result in the equalizer. A little later in the frame, Amelia Griffiths got alone with the ball in the circle and was one-on-one with Kingswood goalie Jessica Distler, but her shot went wide. \"In times of trouble, our defense pulls together as much as it can to get the ball out,\" Distler said. \"We're very good at communication, talking to each other.\" Had one walked into the stadium in the final 10 minutes of the game without looking at the scoreboard, one would have thought Kingswood was the team desperate for a goal, as it was the Knights that were applying the most offensive pressure. \"We always play like it's 0-0,\" said Reilly. \"Especially in a one-goal game. We need to not stop, we need to play smart, make sure we're controlling the game. That's what we've been practicing to do.\" St. Thomas spent most of its time late in the game just trying to clear the ball, let alone generate a decent scoring opportunity. An apparent goal off the stick of Kingswood's Abbey Dubel was waved off, which would have made the final 7:16 of the game a lot less stressful for the Knights. But the Saints' lone opportunity in the final minutes came when Williams took the ball into the circle but was unable to get off a shot. Lebanon beat Kingswood 5-1 in Wolfeboro when the teams met Oct. 6, a game Reilly thought was closer than the final score indicated. \"Since then, our emphasis on scoring and learning from that game has helped drive some of what it is that we've done since then,\" she said. \"The girls are excited for another shot.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:09:56.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
