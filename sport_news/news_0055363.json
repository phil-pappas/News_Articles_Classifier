We know that. But this guy kept them off balance and allowed the offense to settle in and get some runs.”\nTulowitzki provided three of those runs. He broke the game open with a bases-clearing double off Kelvin Herrera in the sixth, giving him seven runs batted in in the series. Edwin Encarnacion had walked with the bases loaded against Edinson Volquez, who seemed flustered by a couple of close calls against the Royals.\n  Kansas City totaled 22 runs and 30 hits in the first two games in Toronto, but Estrada faced the minimum 20 batters before Lorenzo Cain walked with two outs in the seventh. Closer Roberto Osuna was perfect in the ninth.\nAs the series shifts back to Kansas City, Yordano Ventura will start for the defending AL champions on Friday in Game 6 against David Price, the Game 2 loser. Price has lost seven straight postseason starts.\nEstrada, a 32-year-old free-agent to be, kept the bullpen door closed for most of the afternoon, a day after Kansas City romped 14-2 in a game that saw infielder Cliff Pennington pitch in the ninth.\n“This time around I had a better fastball command,” said Estrada, who gave up three runs in the opener. “That was the key to this game.”\nToronto is trying to become just the 13th team to rally and win among 80 who trailed 3-1 in a best-of-seven postseason series. It has happened four of 17 times in the LCS, including when the Royals bounced back against the Blue Jays in 1985 en route to Kansas City’s only World Series title. In this year’s best-of-five Division Series, Toronto fell behind 2-0, then won three straight against Texas.\nBefore 49,325 roaring fans, Chris Colabello’s solo homer into the left-field seats in the second gave Estrada a lead. It was the only mistake by Volquez, the Game 1 winner.\nEstrada didn’t make a miscue until Salvador Perez homered with two outs in the eighth. Estrada retired his first nine batters, ending at four Alcides Escobar’s record streak of leading off playoff games with hits.\nEscobar, who entered 9 for 15 (.600), got Kansas City’s first hit when he opened the fourth with a ground single past a diving Tulowitzki.\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:04:15.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
