The guys helped me a lot.”\nJets head coach Paul Maurice said he plans to dress the same lineup to face the Devils in their season opener, but Michael Hutchinson starts in goal after Ondrej Pavelec made 29 saves in Thursday's 6-2 victory over the Bruins.\n“For all the reasons,” said Maurice,when asked what went into the decision. “(Pavelec) played really well last night and it's good for a goaltender to keep some confidence after a real solid win. We have the luxury of two guys that played big numbers last year and deserve to be in the net. Back-to-back at the start of the year is a perfect time to get him in.”\nThe Jets also won their season opener by a 6-2 score over the Arizona Coyotes before dropping the next four games, a fact not lost on many of the players and Maurice.\n“It might have been 6-2 but it was a perfect game for us and we know it,” said Jets centre Bryan Little. “We had a slow start, which is kind of uncharacteristic of this team. We made some mistakes that (Pavelec) had to bail us out of. There is room for improvement and things we can get better at.”\n“That game (Thursday) felt a whole lot different than the one in Phoenix,” added Maurice. “We were up 4-0 eight or nine minutes into the game and spent the rest of the net in our end. The things we had to fix became evident after Game 1 last year and we spent eight months trying to work on the gapping and things like that.\n“I don't think anybody is feeling too high here today after that game. We scored six and that's great, but both teams probably could have scored five more.”\nWith 37 seconds left in the first, Burmistrov caught Bergeron with an apparent elbow to the chin of Bergeron, who has a history of concussions and responded with a pair of cross checks.\n“That was my bad, that's for sure. I'm not that kind of player,” said Burmistrov, who finished the game plus-4 in 17 minutes and 41 seconds of action. “I hit him in the head and it's a good thing nothing happened with him (in terms of injury). I was going to hit him in the shoulder and it looked like he tried to get out of the way. I'm sorry.”\nThe fact Bergeron wasn't injured and finished the game was the best news for all parties involved.\n“So much of that is Burmistrov’s body movement. It’s as it would be if two guys were coming together,” said Maurice. “It happens a thousand times a game, two guys come together. When one of them doesn’t, that’s what it looks like. He wasn’t driving up (with his elbow), driving through. I’m a big Bergeron fan. He didn’t leave the game, which is a real positive. I’m glad it was nothing serious.”\nBruins head coach Claude Julien believed that further discipline was warranted and Bergeron didn't appreciate the hit either.\n“It was definitely a hit to the head,” Bergeron told reporters after the game. “Even though he (Burmistrov) apologized after it's one of those, I got rid of it, I didn't have the puck at that time and you got to realize where the guy is and his position.”\nFriday marks the first meeting against the Jets since Jiri Tlusty and Lee Stempniak signed as free agents with the Devils.\nStempniak went to Devils' training camp on a pro tryout offer and earned a one-year, one-way contract worth $850,000.\nNow Stempniak is starting the season on the Devils top line with Travis Zajac and Mike Cammalleri.\n“One of the things we talked about coming into this year was that in order to become a better team and get ourselves into a situation where we're a competitive team every night, we wanted to be competitive within our room,” said Devils head coach John Hynes. “A guy like Lee comes into our room, he's been in the NHL prior to this and he's hungry. He had to come in and earn a job and he did that. That raises the awareness sometimes. To be a good team, we've got to have very competitive individuals on the team and Lee adds to that.”\nFormer Manitoba Moose netminder Cory Schneider will start in goal for the Devils.\nHere's how I expect both teams to start tonight:\nJETS\nAndrew Ladd-Bryan Little-Blake Wheeler Mathieu Perreault-Mark Scheifele-Nikolaj Ehlers Alex Burmistrov-Adam Lowry-Drew Stafford Nic Petan-Andrew Copp-Chris Thorburn Defence\nBen Chiarot-Dustin Byfuglien Toby Enstrom-Tyler Myers Mark Stuart-Jacob Trouba Goalies\nMichael Hutchinson Ondrej Pavelec DEVILS\nMike Cammalleri-Travis Zajac-Lee Stempniak Adam Henrique-Jacob Josefson-Kyle Palmieri Reid Boucher-Sergey Kalinin-Jiri Tlusty Tuomo Ruutu-Stephen Gionta-Jordin Tootoo Defence Andy Greene-Adam Larsson David Schlemko-Damon Severson Jon Merrill-John Moore Goalies\nCory Schneider Keith Kinkaid ken.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nBurmistrov has interesting return to NHL Forward chips in a pair of points in season-opening victory\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Friday, October 09, 2015 01:40 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 09, 2015 03:15 PM EDT\nNEWARK, N.J. — Alex Burmistrov was all over the place as he made his return to the NHL after a two-year absence.\nBy the time his night was over, Burmistrov had recorded an empty-net goal in a 6-2 victory for the Winnipeg Jets over the Boston Bruins, chipped in an assist and also drew the ire of the opposition for a high check on centre Patrice Bergeron.\nBurmistrov doesn't have a hearing scheduled with the NHL Department of Player Safety, so he'll be back in the lineup tonight when the Winnipeg Jets (1-0-1) face the New Jersey Devils (0-0-0-) at the Prudential Center.\n“I felt better than I did in the exhibition games, that's for sure,” said Burmistrov, who was playing his first NHL game after spending the past two seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League. “It's a different game.
