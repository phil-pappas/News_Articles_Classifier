I maybe didn't expect it to go this well. \n\"At the start of the season I set myself a target to try to become a regular in the U21s and try to get a few starts in the Premier League. \n\"Obviously, I've got a few starts already, so it's been a great start and I can't thank the players and staff enough for helping me settle in and play as well as I have been.\" \nThursday was certainly an unforgettable day for Alli and was one which almost got even better as the he turned in another impressive display as Spurs took on Monaco in the Europa League. \nHowever, a late header from substitute Stephan El Shaarawy saw the encounter end in 1-1 draw, leaving Alli ruing what could have been. \n\"It feels like a defeat,\" Alli told the club's website. \"It was a strong first half from us and maybe we could have seen the game out, finished a few more chances but it wasn't to be. \n\"I think it shows how well we are doing at the minute, obviously to come away to Monaco and 1-1 to feel like a loss. The boys are down and I think it is important we pick ourselves up again and take the positives from this game into the game at Swansea.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:44:29.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
