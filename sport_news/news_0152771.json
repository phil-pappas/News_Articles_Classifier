Photo: Ronald Martinez, Getty Images Matt Hasselbeck led the Colts to their third straight win. Matt Hasselbeck, Andre Johnson lead Colts past Texans 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nAndre Johnson proved to his former team that he still has plenty left. \nJohnson caught two touchdown passes from Matt Hasselbeck, including one for 2 yards in the fourth quarter, to help the visiting Indianapolis Colts beat the Houston Texans 27-20 on Thursday night. \n“You get over the age of 30 they kind of count you out,” Johnson said. “But we proved to people that we could still play.” \nReleased by Houston in March after 12 seasons with the team, Johnson had six catches for 77 yards. \nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games. \nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left. \nHasselbeck, 40, was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. \nHasselbeck’s performance (18 of 29, 213 yards) was even more impressive given the fact that he was battling a bacterial infection that hospitalized him this week. \nFormer 49ers running back Frank Gore had 22 carries for 98 yards and a touchdown for the Colts. \nMallett got the wind knocked out of him on an illegal hit midway through the second quarter and was replaced by Hoyer. Mallett looked to be OK soon after that, but coach Bill O’Brien stuck with Hoyer. He finished with 312 yards passing with two touchdowns. Both of the touchdowns were to rookie Jaelen Strong on his first two NFL receptions. \nDeAndre Hopkins had 11 receptions for 169 yards for Houston. \nArian Foster, who was shaken up in the second quarter but returned after halftime, had 44 yards rushing and 77 yards receiving in his second game back after groin surgery. \nMariota improves on paper: Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota’s rookie season is off to an even better start now after a statistical correction improved his passer rating and completion percentage. \nThe Titans announced Thursday that the Elias Sports Bureau corrected an incomplete pass on the first offensive play of Tennessee’s opening 42-14 win at Tampa Bay. A penalty was called on the play, and Mariota originally was credited with an incomplete pass while a Tampa Bay penalty was enforced after the play. Elias changed the scoring with the penalty negating the play. \nMariota still had a perfect 158.3 passer rating for the game. He now has one fewer incompletion, boosting his passer rating from 109.2 to 110.3 along with a 63.5 completion percentage instead of 62.9. \nBriefly: Atlanta receiver Roddy White is back with the team and says he is encouraged about his role following a meeting with head coach Dan Quinn. White said Thursday he missed Wednesday’s practice to be with his mother, who had surgery. White had complained about his diminished role in Atlanta’s offense earlier in the week. ... Sean Lee returned to the field for the first time since suffering a concussion in the first quarter of the Cowboys’ overtime loss to New Orleans on Sunday.
