The loss drops Cedar Grove's record to 7-8, while Bloomfield improved to 14-0 on the season. Buy this photo Zach Gewelb/Staff photographer Sophomore Mikalya Hom attempts to move the ball past a Bloomfield defender during Cedar Grove's 4-0 loss to the Bengals Monday, Oct. 12 at Memorial Middle School. \nDespite the loss, head coach Mike Carlucci said he was impressed with how his team battled the Bengals, who previously dispatched the Panthers 8-0 earlier this season. \n\"Overall, it was our best effort of the year so far,\" Carlucci said. \"We played them the first time and it was 8-0 and they played possession the last 20 minutes of the game. Today, we let up a quick goal 30 seconds in. We played a pretty good 80 minutes except for those first 30 seconds.\" \nCedar Grove started the game with the possession, but Bloomfield forced a turnover near the middle of the field and brought it through the Lady Panthers' defensive zone. The Bengals found an opening and beat Cedar Grove keeper Shannon Burke to score the game's opening goal approximately 35 seconds into the game. \nThe Lady Panthers could have let the early goal keep them down, but Cedar Grove showed great poise and played Bloomfield tough for the remainder of the half. \n\"They got a goal the first 30 seconds, but we just came back and kept the pressure on,\" senior captain Carolyn Maxwell said. \nBloomfield added its second goal late in the first half, but the Lady Panthers went in to halftime pleased with their effort, according to Carlucci. Cedar Grove came out in the second half with renewed energy and managed to put pressure on the Bengals' defense. Carlucci said the offensive pressure can be attributed to Cedar Grove's defensive game plan. \n\"We switched up our formation. Instead of four across in the back, we went with a stopper and a sweeper,\" Carlucci said. \"Carolyn Maxwell has been playing really well as a sweeper cleaning things up back there. We also moved [senior] Kim Perrotta back there to sweeper with Carolyn and it worked out well.\" \nThe defense held Bloomfield in check to start the half and created turnovers to give the offense possession of the ball. The midfielders tried to move the ball up front to forwards Brianna Pereira and Amanda Martino. Pereira, a senior, and Martino, a sophomore, gave the offense a pulse, as the duo worked together to move the ball to the net. \n\"Bri, you always know what you're going to get from here every day,\" Carlucci said. \"Amanda Martino stepped it up today. She's got speed and she's strong. When she puts her mind to it, she can run through a wall.\" \nMidfielder Sara Meixner played a big role in advancing the ball to Pereira and Martino, but the senior sat out the last 20 minutes of the game after getting into a collision on the sideline. Meixner and Pereira have great chemistry on the field, and her loss forced the Lady Panthers to adjust their formation, which slowed down the offense. \n\"Sara and Bri are amazing together,\" Maxwell said. \"But Sara had to come out for a little bit and I played in her spot. Bri was working so hard to make up for that loss and she was really playing amazing.\" \nCedar Grove continued the pressure Bloomfield, but could not find the back of the net. Meanwhile, the Bengals added two late goals to take a 4-0 lead and secured the victory. \nMaxwell said she was happy to see such a strong effort from her teammates against a powerhouse opponent. \n\"I think it was honestly amazing,\" she said. \"This is the best team in our division and they beat everyone by eight or nine each game. Even though we didn't win, our team put forth such great effort.\" \nCarlucci said he believes the team can use this kind of performance as motivation moving forward. \n\"This is how we want to play. It's getting closer to tournament time, so this is what we want,\" he said. \"Last year, we went on a little bit of a slide before the state tournament and we want to try and gain some momentum. Hopefully we can build on this.\" \nMoving forward, the Lady Panthers will focus on improving their offense. The team has managed to create scoring chances against good opponents, but have been unable to capitalize. \n\"We had a couple of opportunities to shoot, but we need to work on getting those shots on goal,\" Maxwell said. \nCarlucci said he feels this is a team capable of making some noise in the state tournament if the Lady Panthers can minimize their mistakes and maximize their efforts. \n\"I've been telling the girls in practice that I've been seeing flashes of good things, but it's got to roll over into the games.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:18:25.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
