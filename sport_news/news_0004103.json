The award is given annually to the top defensive back in college football. \nCash enters this week's game ranked second in the country in tackles for loss per game with 2.00 and is fourth in total TFL with 14.0. A native of Miami, Fla., Cash stands second on the team with 58 tackles and paces the squad with 2.5 sacks, eight quarterback pressures and three forced fumbles. \nEarlier this month, Cash was placed on six midseason All-America squads. After the Georgia Tech game on September 26, he was named the FWAA National Defensive Player of the Week, Walter Camp National Defensive Player of the Week, Chuck Bednarik Award Player of the Week, Lott IMPACT Trophy Player of the Week and Jim Thorpe Award Player of the Week. Duke has never had a Thorpe Award winner. Last week Cash was announced as a quarterfinalist for the Lott IMPACT Trophy. \nThe Thorpe Award is named after one of history's greatest athletes, Jim Thorpe. Thorpe excelled at every sport in which he competed, including football at which he played on offense and defense. \nThree Thorpe Award finalists will be named November 23 with the winner announced at the Home Depot College Football Awards Show on December 10. The winner of the 2015 Thorpe Award will be honored at a banquet in Oklahoma City on February 2, 2016. \nThorpe Award Semifinalists \nVonn Bell, Ohio State, Jr. \nJeremy Cash, Duke, Sr. \nVernon Hargreaves III, Florida, Jr. \nMike Hilton, Mississippi, Sr.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:10:26.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
