She told investigators she awoke to find him sexually assaulting her. \nThe 20-year-old Searl was arrested on campus Thursday and booked on suspicion of three counts of rape. \nPolice did not know if he'd retained an attorney, and a phone listing for Searl could not be found. \nUCLA coach Jim Mora said in a statement that Searl has been suspended indefinitely and the team is taking the allegations very seriously. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:20:57.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
