The roster consists of mostly underclassmen, including six freshmen. \nGuards Marquelle Dent and Jordan Kelley are the only seniors. \nDuring media day on Wednesday, veteran players for both teams spoke of the need to make sure they teach the younger players what's expected of them every day. \n\"It's given us a different drive now that we've seen what it takes,\" redshirt sophomore guard Trey Washington III said. \"We know we can get there . the young guys, they want to experience it as well. \n\"I think the question is, 'Can we improve and play at the level we played at last year?'\" \nJunior guard Jason McManamen said he is telling the younger players how to win and how to \"be a piece of the puzzle.\" \nCowgirls coach Joe Legerski said a Dent and Kelley will be called on to lead the team that he describes as his most inexperienced yet. \n\"For both those (seniors), a great deal of the burden is going to fall on them early,\" Legerski said. \nDent said she believes the Cowgirls are \"going to shock a lot of people\" this season. \n\"...I think the people who are coming in and the returners are going to step up,\" she said. \nThe Cowboys host Fort Lewis in an exhibition game Nov. 7. Their first regular-season game is against Bristol University out of California at 7 p.m. Nov. 13 in Laramie. \nThe Cowgirls open this season with an exhibition against visiting Adams State at 7 p.m. Nov. 5. The regular season opens with a pair of home games against Chadron State (Nov. 15) and St. Mary's (Nov. 20). \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:15:43.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
