They competed in the third of four regattas taking place this fall in Ohio. The turnout was impressive for a sport that is still finding its legs in the state. \n\"For us, it was about getting the high school kids out there competing against each other,\" said event organizer Erik Schumann. \nSchumann is an Indian Hill resident and member of the Cowan Lake Sailing Association and Interlake Yachting Association. Both organizations have been part of the initiative to grow and develop the sport at the high school level in the state this year. Other states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Maryland, and South Carolina, have competitive high school sailing. The goal is for Ohio to grow the sport organically, first with club teams, then eventual OHSAA recognition and sanctioned events. \n\"Most of these kids are members of their area clubs,\" said Schumann, \"but it hasn't been a sport that's taken off in Ohio yet.\" \nThe event at Cowan Lake was a Level 3 event, allowing competitors from different schools to join forces on the same team. In Level 1 events, teams can only be made up of sailors from the same high school. Indian Hill and Mariemont sailors joined forces. St. Xavier, Loveland, and Seven Hills were also among the schools represented at Cowan Lake. \nThe hope is that these competitors will return to their schools and spread the word among their classmates. Fellow students may come watch a regatta, or hit the lake to train with their more experienced friends. Spreading knowledge of the sport is the biggest hurdle to overcome at this time. \n\"It's about getting friends out on the water,\" said Schumann. \"Kids get invited up to an event and they get hooked.\" \nLuke Schumann, a sophomore at Indian Hill, and his sister Sara, a seventh-grader at Indian Hill Middle School, have been competing at a high level for years. Luke has introduced friends from Indian Hill and St. Xavier to the sport. Sara competes internationally and trains each summer in Newport, Rhode Island. \nOhio high school sailing is open to seventh- and eighth-graders as well. Most of the competitors compete for their local yachting clubs. Sailing is one of the fastest-growing high school sports, one that Schumann said athletic directors have compared to rowing and gymnastics. Like rowing, it requires large spaces and assets which make it a pay-to-play sport. The sailboats and coaches are provided by the local clubs and paid for by the participating families. \nThe 2015 promotional season has seen dedication from teams throughout the state. Some schools in northeast Ohio have already recognized the sport on a club level. Growth is inevitable, thanks to the excitement and dedication of the young sailors. \n\"Many of the student-sailors already have another fall sport, but they are so dedicated to getting high school sailing off the ground that they are giving up their Saturdays and Sundays to practice and compete,\" said Schumann. \"One of the unique things about the sport is that it's very physical, but it's also mentally taxing. \n\"It's a great sport.\" \nCombined team results, Oct. 3 regatta \n1.
