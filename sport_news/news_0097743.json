(Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images) LOS ANGELES â€“ Three strikes you're out! After three consecutive disappointing postseason runs, the Los Angeles Dodgers and manager Don Mattingly agreed to mutually part ways on Thursday , ending his five-year run as manager, and eight year relationship with the team. \"As our end of season process began, we discussed the past year, our future goals, necessary changes, roster needs and other matters relating to next year's campaign,\" said Dodgers President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman in a statement released by the team. \"As the dialogue progressed daily, it evolved to a point where we all agreed that it might be best for both sides to start fresh.\" Dodgers Mutually Part Ways With Don Mattingly \"We decided to think about it for a couple of days and when we spoke again, we felt comfortable that this was the direction to go,\" Friedman continued. \"I have the utmost respect for Donnie and thoroughly enjoyed working with him this past season. I want to thank him for his hard work and collaboration, as well as his accomplishments, including three consecutive National League West titles. I wish him nothing but success in the future.\" Mattingly had a .551 winning percentage as manager of the Dodgers, the third highest after at least five seasons in franchise history. However, his postseason failures will stamp his legacy in Dodger blue, not his regular season record. Vin Scully to Miss 2015 Postseason Mattingly released a statement of his own, shortly after the team released theirs: \"I'm honored and proud to have had the opportunity to manage the Los Angeles Dodgers,\" Mattingly wrote. \"I've enjoyed my experiences and relationships with the organization's staff and players throughout my eight years in L.A.\" \"After meeting with Andrew, Farhan and Josh, we all felt that a fresh start would be good for both the organization and me,\" Mattingly continued. \"We talked about several scenarios, including my returning in 2016. However, I believe this is the right time and right move for both parties. I'm still very passionate about managing and hope to get the opportunity in the near future. In the meantime, I want to thank the Dodger organization, the city and our fans for the opportunity and wish the club well going forward. Mattingly should not be unemployed long as he figures to be a top managerial candidate for openings in Miami, San Diego, Washington and Seattle. In the meantime, the Dodgers search for a new manager begins now.
