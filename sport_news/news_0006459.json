Record-signing Mesut Ozil missed an early penalty before goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off for bringing down Arjen Robben. Although David Alaba's penalty hit the post, the Bundesliga side went on to capitalise with a second-half bullet from Toni Kroos and then a late header from substitute Thomas Muller all but killed off the tie ahead of the return leg in Germany. Arsenal, though, performed admirably at the Allianz Arena, equalising through Lukas Podolski having fallen behind to Bastian Schweinsteiger's close-range effort early in the second half as the match ended 1-1 after Lukasz Fabianski saved a stoppage-time penalty from Thomas Muller. \nBayern Munich 0 Arsenal 2 (Champions League last 16, March 2013) \nThe Gunners headed to Bavaria facing a Mission: Impossible after being defeated 3-1 in the first leg at the Emirates Stadium following a European master-class from Bayern in London. However, an early goal from Olivier Giroud gave Arsenal a glimmer of hope, but only some fine saves from Fabianski kept the hosts at bay. Defender Laurent Koscielny headed in to level the tie on aggregate with four minutes left, but there was to be no fairytale ending as the Gunners were knocked out on the away goals rule. Bayern went on to reach the final at Wembley, where they beat German rivals Borussia Dortmund. \nArsenal 1 Bayern Munich 0 (March 2005) \nBefore their recent double header, it had been almost 10 years since Arsenal and Bayern met in elite European competition. Again, the sides were paired in the knockout round and once more the English team were found wanting in the first leg, going down 3-1 at the Olympiastadion albeit with a valuable late away goal from Kolo Toure. The Gunners, though, found the required performance in the return at Highbury, where Thierry Henry's superb strike just after the hour set up a grandstand finale, latching onto a through ball from Ashley Cole before slotting past Oliver Kahn. However, the crucial second goal just would not come as the Germans closed out for a 3-2 aggregate win. \nArsenal 2 Bayern Munich 2 (Champions League group stage two, December 2000) \nEarlier in the competition's inception, there were two group stages to navigate before the quarter-final stage which is where Arsenal and Bayern met for the first time. Playing in yellow at Highbury, Arsenal raced into an early lead through Henry before Kanu made it 2-0 on 55 minutes. However, the Germans immediately reduced the deficit through Michael Tarnat before Mehmet Scholl's fine free-kick levelled the match. The teams met again following the winter break in March, where Bayern won 1-0, but both clubs qualified for the last eight. Arsenal went out at the quarter-final stage to Valencia, losing on the away goals rule. Bayern would go on to beat the Spaniards in the final following a dramatic penalty shoot-out at the San Siro in Milan.
