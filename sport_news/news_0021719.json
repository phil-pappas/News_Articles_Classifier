Related Links Plainfield North has no trouble with Romeoville \nThat's only the half of it. \nIf the Indians (7-1, 5-0) beat T.F. North next week, they win the South Suburban Blue outright and with it, the automatic bid to the playoffs. They're in already, as is Oak Forest (7-1, 4-1). There's the postseason seeding and pride involved in this, however. \nIt was a thorough trouncing by the hosts in a series where the road team had won the previous five games. Lemont held Oak Forest to 89 yards and just 6 yards in the second half. The Bengals came into the game having scored 281 points and allowing only 107. \nThe Indians jumped to a 21-0 lead with two touchdowns in the game's first six minutes and a third score in the second quarter. \nJeremy Fejedelem bolted 19 yards off left end for the first score, capping a five-play drive 2:27 into the game. After Oak Forest's second straight three-and-out, the Indians made it 14-0 on Steven Fleming's 32-yard reception from Spencer Nagel midway through the quarter. \nLemont made it a three-touchdown advantage on Nagel's 20-yard collaboration with a wide open Fejedelem with 2:36 left in the opening half. \nJake Kirkman and Matt Dunne added rushing touchdowns in the second half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:47:46.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
