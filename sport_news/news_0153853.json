You could see he brought a lot to the table. It’s not very often your quarterback leads you in all categories: running, throwing and receiving. It’s a unique situation but one we’ve got to be keyed into and aware of.” \nOn the other hand, it doesn’t speak well of the receiving corps that a quarterback’s 58-yard catch off a trick play would lead the team for a game. Not only that game, but three of Tennessee’s four games those 58 yards would make Dobbs the leading receiver. \nThe Vols don’t have a wide receiver with 100 receiving yards this season. \nQuite a contrast to Arkansas junior wideout Drew Morgan netting 155 receiving yards from senior quarterback Brandon Allen in just one game, the 28-21 SEC overtime loss last Saturday to Texas A&M at the Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium. \n“It’s something we obviously don’t want.” Tennessee coach Butch Jones said. “You are talking to a former wide receiver coach. So we want to be a receiver-oriented offense and get them the football and the big plays. We have worked very hard on that but we do have to improve that greatly.” \nThe Vols’ receivers’ struggles could tempt Arkansas safety Rohan Gaines to join the chase on one of of Dobbs’ scrambles but the senior defensive back knows better. \n“I am definitely going to play my responsibility.” Gaines said. “If I have to play the receiver, that’s what I am going to do. I’ll leave that (chasing Dobbs) to those guys up front.” \nAfter playing at the Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium, he Hogs wouldn’t be awed by any stadium. \nBut 102,400 seat Neyland Stadium full of Tennessee orange, is an entity unto itself says Arkansas offensive line coach Sam Pittman. \nPittman should know having coached Tennessee’s line in 2012. \n“The first time I was interviewed.” Pittman said. “I saw that stadium and said,‘They ain’t hiring me.’ That stadium is incredible! We have to be ready for that crowd noise. The noise will be big time but there are several places in the SEC that are big-time places. Tennessee is as good as any of them.” \nArkansas tight ends coach Barry Lunney was Arkansas’ quarterback when the 3-7-1 SEC debuting Razorbacks of 1992 stunned the then nationally No. 4 5-0 Vols, 25-24. \nLunney recalled it was one of those 11:30 a.m. Jefferson-Pilot televised game. \nUpon taking his first warmups, Lunney “There were like just 10,000 scattered around and I thought this crowd noise part is going to be easy. Then we came back out before kickoff and it was full.” \nThe Razorbacks, including at Thursday’s closed practice wrapping up this week’s preparation in Fayetteville, not only have heard the Vols’ “Rocky Top” song blaring constantly as they practice but even while they work out in the weight room, Drew Morgan said. \n“The first time I heard it I thought I was going to die, “ Morgan said. “I t was bad piercing. I can’t stand that music. I’m embracing it, but I hope to have earplugs in.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:15:10.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
