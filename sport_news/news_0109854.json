Russellville (3-5, 2-3 7A/6A-Central Conference) picked up 272 yards on 53 carries during the 34-7 Senior Night victory. \"I thought we played well up front,\" Dawson said. \"I thought our defense was lights out except for a few times in the game.\"But it didn't start that way.Alma (5-3, 3-2) went up 7-0 with 7:27 left in the first quarter after Cale Fulsom's pass was intercepted by Alex Beneux and returned 42 yards for a touchdown on Russellville's opening series.Dawson was proud of the way his team bounced back. It would have been easy for Fulsom, who went 10-of-19 for 124 yards and two touchdowns, to hang his head after the interception. The junior said he \"wiped it off\" as soon as it happened. \"Throw it away,\" he said. \"Wipe it off. That's what we always say.\"The Cyclones went back to work on their 36. Jackson Hickey collected 32 yards on eight carries, with Fulsom connecting with Ryan Meador on a seven-yard pass to chip away. The drive ended on a 41-yard field goal attempt by Nate Turner that went wide left.After forcing the Airedales to punt, Russellville took over at midfield. Fulsom found Caleb Stokes for 25 yards before Josiah Woodard picked up 11 yards on two consecutive runs. Fulsom scored on the next play from 12 yards out to tie the game 7-7 after a successful PAT kick by Turner.Alma moved the ball 71 yards on 13 plays on its next drive — but they needed five more. Facing fourth-and-one on the Russellville 5, the Airedales' chance at the end zone came up short when Matt Campbell and Cole McKown double-teamed Alma in the backfield.The Cyclones capped a 90-yard drive with a field goal to take a 10-7 lead at halftime. Fulsom found Stokes, Steven Baty and Hickey for 14, 13 and 19 yards on three passes, respectively. Woodard scurried for 18 yards on three carries Fulsom picked up 26 on two.The field goal was vital, Dawson said. Russellville deferred to the second half, so capping the final drive before halftime with some points was more important than trying to convert a fourth-and-2.Russellville opened the second half with another touchdown, this time driving 68 yards in 11 plays. Fulsom capped the drive with a 1-yard keeper into the end zone to make it 17-7 with 8:08 left in the third quarter.When Alma took its next offensive snap, it was the first since 6:05 in the second quarter — about an hour break. But the rest didn't' help. Alma returned the kickoff to the Russellville 12, but after three big stops settled for — and missed — a 30-yard field goal.The Cyclones went up 20-7 with 9:01 in the fourth quarter on a 39-yard field goal by Turner.A fumble on the next Airedales drive put the Cyclones back on offense on the Alma 48. Seven plays later, Hickey crossed the goal line on a six-yard carry to make it 27-7 with 4:50 left in the game.Alma, unable to put a drive together, tried a fake punt deep in its own territory. Marquis Rhode broke up the play and Russellville took over on its 29. Three plays later, Fulsom found Stokes for a 13-yard touchdown to set the final score.\"A lot of guys played really well,\" Dawson said. \"We ran it with authority. It was a team effort.\"Hickey finished the night with 101 yards on 24 carries and a touchdown. He had 31 yards on two catches and a touchdown. McKown had 83 yards on 14 carries. Woodard had 42 yards on seven carries.Stokes had 51 yards on three catches and a touchdown.Alma was held to 136 yards of total offense. Quarterback Noah Dotson was 12-of-19 for 111 yards. He had 10 carries for four yards. Trey Thompson led in rushes with just 16 yards.After celebrating with the band, Dawson called the team to him.\"I don't want you to be amazed by this,\" he told them. \"I want you to get used to this. This is the way it's supposed to be.\"Russellville travels to Conway next week.
