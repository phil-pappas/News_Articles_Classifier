Through the first eight games of the season, the Stamford Bridge faithful have been witness to some of the worst football they’ve ever seen. Games like a 3-0 defeat to Man City at Etihad can be forgiven, but when it’s compounded with home losses to traditionally middling clubs like Southampton and Crystal Palace, an away defeat at Everton, and an inexplicable away draw against last place Newcastle, the natives are going to get restless.\nMourinho’s salty demeanor and schizophrenic employment history aren’t exactly working in his favor, either. The Portuguese manager has never been one to stay put at any club for very long; sometimes he goes when he feels like he has nothing left to accomplish (e.g. his first stint at Chelsea and his following posting at Inter Milan), and sometimes when he’s just dissatisfied with his situation (e.g. his 2013 departure from Real Madrid).\nNow, given the club’s miserable performance despite returning roughly the same roster that breezed through the league last season, plus the clashes that occurred between Mourinho and owner Roman Abramovich during the manager’s first stint, the tension around Stamford Bridge has to be off the charts. Would anyone be surprised to see Mourinho sacked—or simply leave on his own if the team doesn’t turn things around in the next week or two?\nTurning our attention to the other side of the pond, Jurgen Klinsmann finds himself on even shakier ground following the USMNT’s crushing defeat at the hands of El Tri, a loss that knocked the Americans out of the 2017 Confederations Cup. It also comes after a pathetic fourth place finish in the Gold Cup, and a less important but equally embarrassing showing in a home friendly against Brazil.\nThat string of disappointing performances after all the progress that the squad showed at the World Cup have led to increasingly loud whispers around the USMNT and statements by former players that Klinsmann is simply not the man to take them to the next level.\nHe’s undoubtedly a skilled technical director, having brought in several dual national players like John Brooks, Fabian Johnson, Timmy Chandler, Ventura Alvarado, Mix Diskerud, and a host of others. There’s also been marked improvement at the younger levels, with more well-developed teenage players than we’ve ever seen. But there’s no denying that Klinsmann is seriously deficient as an in-game tactician. After the games, he is always full of reasons ( often baloney ones ) as to why the team didn’t meet expectations , but consistently fails to adjust when things don’t go according to plan.\nOf course, that would also imply that there IS a plan, something that has yet to be proven. Klinsmann arrived four years ago under the promise to change the style of the US senior team, but it’s hard to point out any tangible results of that change. Even from game to game, one of the biggest complaints from past players is that the manager doesn’t practice tactics or formulate game plans prior to matches, focusing almost exclusively on fitness in training sessions.\nAdd it all up and it’s easy to see why USA Soccer would be wise to move on from Klinsmann. When a team is perpetually primed to take the next step but never does, something’s got to give. In an ideal world, he’d step down as head coach but retain the position of technical director. But even if that’s not in the cards (and it likely isn’t), the time is ripe to bring in someone who can push them to the next level.\nHere is where we come back to Mourinho. It may seem a pipe dream to imagine arguably the world’s most celebrated manager taking the reins of a struggling national team, the vast majority of whose fan base only really cares about soccer every four years. Yet Mourinho himself has taken notice of the Yanks’ progress over the past several years, and even explicitly stated back in 2012 that he’d like to coach them at some point in his career.\nBack then, the big sticking point for Mourinho was that a) he’d rather coach his native team of Portugal first and b) he didn’t want to move to the States before his three children were in college. Yet Portugal just installed Fernando Santos as its manager a little over a year ago and likely won’t be ditching him before he even gets a chance to lead the team into a major international competition. As for the kids, Mourinho’s youngest will turn 18 and head off to school next year, so that should no longer be an issue.\nThe sticking point is that, as Mourinho himself has pointed out, coaching a national team is far different from coaching a club team, and he only has experience with the latter. Thus it goes without saying that should he take over the coaching duties, the technical director position should be handled by someone with experience in recruitment and development of national players.\nHere too, however, is where the fates may be aligning. As I said, Klinsmann is unlikely to be willing to stay on as technical director while someone else comes in to coach the squad—that is, unless the replacement is an old friend and supporter who also happens to be one of the most brilliant coaching minds in the world. Having your team ripped away from you and handed to someone else who people feel will do a better job is a humiliating experience. Having it handed to the most sought-after coach in the world would go a long way towards easing that blow.\nJose Mourinho might be the only person in the world who could allow Klinsmann to do what he does best while pushing the talent that he’s assembled to the next level. And soon enough, the time may never be better to pull that off and accomplish the biggest coup in the history of USA Soccer.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/mourinho-has-eyes-on-u-s/", "http://www.worldsoccer.com/news/mourinho-backs-klinsmann-81626", "http://www.espnfc.us/confederations-cup-playoff/story/2650574/landon-donovan-klinsmann-should-go-if-us-loses-to-mexico", "https://twitter.com/JeffreyCarlisle/status/653069276287381504", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3267608/Jose-Mourinho-launched-seven-minute-rant-challenge-Roman-Abramovich-support-recent-slump-says-Sir-Alex-Ferguson.html", "https://twitter.com/NateWST/status/653069406013001728", "http://sports.yahoo.com/video/jos-mourinho-u-soccer-jurgen-070313126.html", "https://twitter.com/HeyHayward/status/653072678581092352/photo/1", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:34:10.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
