Mostly to New York (14,649 people), Massachusetts (13,287) and Florida (12,944), according to the estimates. More than 10,000 others left for California and North Carolina.\n“It’s the economy,” said Orlando J. Rodriguez, an associate legislative analyst with the Latino and Puerto Rican Affairs Commission and the former director of the Connecticut State Data Center. “It’s the same thing it’s always been.”\n“This is something we’ve been talking about for years,” Rodriguez said.\nMore people have moved out of Connecticut than have moved in for at least the last five years, Census data show. In 2010, that net out-migration was about 13,000, almost the same as in 2014. The number sharply increased in 2011 and dipped in 2012 and 2013 but have always shown an overall exodus.\nThe census data support earlier population projections that show that the state is aging, and retirees are moving out of they can. To compound the problem, fewer young people are moving in, and young people are having fewer children or are having them later in life.\nThat presents a particular problem for Connecticut, compounded by the fact that many retirees who leave the state are relatively wealthy.\n“When you retire, you go on a fixed income, so there’s less to tax,” Rodriguez said. “As the population ages, older people don’t buy stuff. We’re a consumer-based economy — people with children buy stuff. So we don’t have a lot of kids, and young people with a lot of college debt aren’t buying stuff. Older people aren’t buying stuff either. Older people spend money on health care and travel. The tax base is shrinking.”\nIndeed, a monthly letter from the state Office of Policy and Management released Monday shows that the state expects $109 million less revenue from personal income taxes than it budgeted for this year.\nRecent real estate data has painted a complementary, and bleak, picture: more homes are being sold in recent months, but prices aren’t increasing.\nAnd a Quinnipiac poll last week showed record levels of dissatisfaction with Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and overwhelming disapproval of the way his administration is handling taxes. Even 61 percent of Democrats disapproved.\nBut despite the popular malaise, one group is moving into Connecticut in sharply increasing numbers: Puerto Ricans, who already are the state’s largest group of Hispanic residents.\nPuerto Rico’s fiscal woes have mounted over the last decade. Public debt is sharply up, the labor rate is down, housing prices and investment are “collapsing,” and the population is falling rapidly as people scramble to get out, according to a June report on the island’s economy .\nIn 2010, about 59,885 people left Puerto Rico for the United States, according to the census data. By 2014, that number had increased by about 40 percent, to 83,844. The island’s net loss in 2014 was about 1.82 percent of its total population, an exodus rate second only to Alaska’s.\nThe number of people who left Puerto Rico for Connecticut has more than doubled in the last five years: from 2,027 in 2010 to 4,210 in 2014.\nThe 301,182 Puerto Ricans in Connecticut in 2014 account now for 56 percent of the Hispanic population in the state, according to an analysis done by the Latino and Puerto Rican Affairs Commission — up a tick from 55 percent in 2010.\nBut almost half of all Puerto Ricans in Connecticut were born in the state, said Carlos Vargas-Ramos, a Research Associate at the CENTRO, Center for Puerto Rican Studies in New York. And some might have left and come back.\n“What may be happening now is that … many Puerto Ricans who left Puerto Rico recently are people who lived in Hartford or Bridgeport who went back to Puerto Rico and are now returning,” he said.\n“The dream of the migrant has always been to go back home,” Vargas-Ramos said. “But given how tough the economic situation is in Puerto Rico, that is questionable. On the other hand, you may have many people leave (Connecticut) because of the climate, but at the same time it might not always make sense economically.”\nRodriguez said some older Hispanics have tended to leave the state.\n“As they get older, they leave,” he said. “You retire, you go back to be with your family, in Puerto Rico or Columbia or whatever. If you’re on a U.S. pension, you move to Puerto Rico and you’re better off. … What you’re seeing is young people coming in and older Latinos leaving.”\nBut Social Security payments and veterans’ benefits are lower in Puerto Rico than they are in the states, Vargas-Ramos said.\n“So while it may make some economic sense on some level, it might not at another level,” he said. “You might be able to purchase a home in Puerto Rico at a lower rate than in Connecticut, so that may be an incentive, but if you have less disposable income, it makes you wonder if maybe you’ll go to Florida, where you’ll have similar weather and a similar community.”\nThe Puerto Rican community is highly mobile, he said, especially younger Puerto Ricans looking for economic opportunity. Between 2001 and 2011, more than 16,700 Puerto Ricans moved from New York to Connecticut, he said — and some 92,000 left New York for Florida.\nFlorida is home to more Puerto Ricans than any other state, but as a percentage of the population, Connecticut has the highest concentration of Puerto Ricans in the country, he said.\nPuerto Ricans who are born in Connecticut are more likely to remain in the state, Vargas-Ramos said.\n“Yes, they tend to be pretty stable in Connecticut, but nevertheless, you’re talking about a population in general that’s highly mobile, and the economic conditions in Connecticut arent’ the best. So you consider migration as a strategy.”\nPeople who moved to Connecticut from other states also include about 21,431 from New York, 8,381 from Massachusetts and 6,450 from Florida.\nOther states with high rates of net migration to other states include Alaska (at 7.6 percent, by far the largest), Wyoming, New Jersey, Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.\nCopyright © 2015, Hartford Courant", "external_links": ["http://www.bgfpr.com/documents/PuertoRicoAWayForward.pdf", "https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56268c1d/turbine/hc-thousands-of-connecticut-residents-moving-to-other-states-but-some-moving-in-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:02:01.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
