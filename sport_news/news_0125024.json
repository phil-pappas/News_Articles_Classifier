(AP) â€” The Los Angeles Lakers have waived forward Jonathan Holmes, trimming their roster to 16 players.\nThe Lakers also announced Friday that an MRI exam on guard Jordan Clarkson's injured shoulder shows no significant damage.\nHolmes was an undrafted rookie from the University of Texas. His departure leaves the Lakers needing to make just one more roster cut before their season opener against Minnesota on Wednesday.\nThe competition for the final roster spot appears to be between veteran Metta World Peace and Jabari Brown.\nClarkson was hurt in Thursday's preseason finale against Golden State. He has a sore right shoulder, and the Lakers say they will be cautious with his recovery.\nClarkson averaged 11.9 points and 3.5 assists last season as a rookie for the Lakers.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
