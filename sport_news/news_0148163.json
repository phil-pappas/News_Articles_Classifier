We could see much of the same through Friday.\nBy Friday a breakdown of the ridge may keep temps a few degrees cooler, then a weak cold front for the weekend will drop afternoon highs into the low 80s with overnight lows in the 50s and 60s by Sunday and Monday. It will be cooler at night with less humidity. No real Fall-like temps through the next 10 days.\nFollow me on Twitter: @BruceKatzFOX8\n- Meteorologist Bruce Katz\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
