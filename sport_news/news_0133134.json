Ramapo will play in Thursday’s Group 2 semifinals at Mercer County Park in West Windsor.\nIn Tuesday’s feature match, Ramapo sophomore first-singles ace Brianna Omar bested Tenafly standout Sasha Shumyatsky, 6-1, 6-2. After Shumyatsky won a marathon opening game, Omar used her lethal serve and forehand to pull away.\n\"The first game I was just hitting the ball back and wasn’t going for my shots,\" Omar said. \"Then my dad came over and said, ‘What the heck kind of tennis is this?’ And that’s when I started winning the match.\n\"Sasha’s backhand slice gave me lots of opportunities to crush my forehand and I love doing that. That’s probably the biggest reason I won.\"\nOmar’s classmate Lauren Laino has won plenty of third-singles matches this year, but moved up to second Tuesday as senior Taylor Thum was sick. Laino had no problem beating Elizabeth Kiselev, 6-2, 6-3.\n\"Taylor has had a couple of illnesses lately and wasn’t able to get out of bed today,\" Laino said.\n\"When I found that out I was shocked. I was like, \"Really? The state [sectional] finals. … I have to play second singles? But our coach reassured me that I could do it and I was happy when it was over.\"\nRamapo’s first-doubles duo of senior Liz Kogan and freshman Nicolette Kogut were just as happy after beating Tenafly’s Caitlin Laufer and Samantha Bugner, 6-3, 6-0. Kogut said they’ve had no problem bridging their age gap this fall.\n\"Our team is like a family, so it’s like having a sister or a cousin as a partner,\" Kogut said. \n\"I thought back to my sophomore year when I was a sophomore playing with a senior,\" Kogan said. \"I didn’t know much about doubles, but my partner helped me so much.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:18:18.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
