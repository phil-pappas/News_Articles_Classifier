Mr. Odom had said he had done cocaine before his arrival, and people at the brothel said they saw him drink alcohol and take as many as 10 supplements sold as “herbal Viagra.” One brand that he took, Reload, was the subject of a 2013 warning from the Food and Drug Administration, which said the pill contained sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra. \nThe brothel also said he became upset Sunday after a phone call in which his ex’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” show was mentioned. But he was generally in a good mood, even suggesting that he stay an entire week at the brothel in the rural community. \nMr. Odom was then found unconscious there Tuesday with white and reddish substances coming from his nose and mouth. He was breathing and taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas. \nThe former NBA star had been a beloved member of the Los Angeles Lakers, winning two championships with the team and enjoying widespread fame as a reality-TV star before his recent downward spiral, which included leaving pro basketball, a pending divorce with Ms. Kardashian and a DUI arrest. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
