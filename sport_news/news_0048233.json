Thursday just presented an opportunity to get her teammates even more involved.\nSection II's leading scorer produced both assists in a 2-1 win at Holy Names. It was a tighter game than perhaps both teams expected but it still had them leaving excited.\nHoly Names for the future, because a young team had a pair of eighth-graders team up for their goal — a game-tying score five minutes into the second half.\nBut Voorheesville coach Joe Santos ' team kept just one game back of Schalmont in the Colonial Council standings (11-1 compared to 10-0). It did so with a senior scoring her first goal this season to break the tie.\n\"We got pushed physically and mentally,\" Santos said. \"But this was good for us.\"\nHensel produced the first assist about 10 minutes in. She flicked the ball over a defender's head. Rebecca Clair buried a shot.\nClair, a sophomore, happens to be Voorheesville's third-best scorer (eight) behind Hensel and Julia Voss (16).\nHensel — 23 goals, seven assists — also produced a connection with Rachel Bogdany.\n\"Coach said hit a line to the six (yard line),\" Hensel said. \"I did my best and our tallest player happened to be there. She made a great play for us.\"\nHensel and Voss, a fellow junior who is tied for sixth in Section II scoring, were regularly double-teamed.\nVoorheesville usually has answers. They've scored 69 goals and allowed just 10.\nHoly Names played even after giving up a quick one.\nIt didn't produce a ton of shots. But Ava Panto 's fine crossing pass set up Bella Tronco.\nBesides Voorheesville's high-scoring duo, Holy Names' Hannah Loder — tied for sixth in Section II scoring with Voss — couldn't capitalize on a couple of opportunities.\nShe had the ball stripped with about 15 minutes left. Coach Will Graham figured she was \"one more poke\" away from being able to fire a scoreboard equalizer.\nIt came about nine minutes after Hensel was a little too aggressive in seeking her own chance.\nBut Hensel came through with about 13 minutes left. The ball spent the majority of time at her team's scoring side in the second half. There's no way to double-team a corner kicker and Holy Names simply doesn't have much height.\n\"We wanted to try and take away their two stars,\" Graham said. \"Then see what they've got. That was a time we couldn't do it.\"\nIt was marked improvement for his team over last year (his first), when it lost 5-0 to the Blackbirds. At 6-4, Holy Names has doubled last year's win total.\n\"The girls played their hearts out,\" Graham said.\nBut Hensel proved she can tear them out, too, without even taking a shot.\nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:45:26.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
