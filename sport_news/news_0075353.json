Lee Crosby’s second interception of the game ices it.\nLobos 28, Rainbow Warriors 27: No. 2 quarterback Austin Apodaca drives the Lobos 80 yards for the go-ahead touchdown, the score coming on a 28-yard pass to Dameon Gamblin. There’s 55 seconds left in the game. Hawaii has the ball on its own 25.\nRainbow Warriors 27, Lobos 21: After UNM turned the ball over on downs at the Hawaii 47, UH kicker Rigoberto Sanchez nails a 47-yard field goal. There’s 12:59 left in the game.\nAfter three quarters: Hawaii 24, New Mexico 21. Hawaii has the ball, second-and-7 at midfield, after the Lobos turned the ball over on downs. UNM went for it on fourth-and-1 from the Hawaii 43 and appeared to make it, but Lobos quarterback Lamar Jordan’s knee touched the ground while he was handling a low snap from center.\nRainbow Warriors 24, Lobos 21: on a third-down and goal from the Hawaii 11, Lamar Jordan scrambles to his right and hits David Anaya in the end zone for a touchdown. The score was set up by safety Lee Crosby’s interception of an Ikaika Woolsey pass. There’s 7:53 left in the third quarter.\nThe second half is about to get under way. The Lobos will receive the kickoff, heading toward the south goal. The wind has completely died down.\nHalftime: Hawaii 24, New Mexico 14 (sorry about the typos on UNM’s score in previous entries, since corrected). Two lost fumbles and some extremely poor defense hurt UNM in the first half. We’ll see what the Lobos can do with the second-half kickoff.\nRainbow Warriors 24, Lobos 14. After UNM’s Chris Davis fumbles, Hawaii needs just five plays to add to their lead. There’s 1:45 left in the second quarter.\nRainbow Warriors 17, Lobos 14.Hawaii drives 79 yards on nine plays to regain the lead with 4:33 left in the second quarter.\nLobos 14, Rainbow Warriors 10: After the Hawaii field goal, the Lobos drive 82 yards on 16 plays to take their first lead of the game. There’s 8:05 left in the second quarter.\nRainbow Warriors 10, Lobos 7: After the Lobos fumble on a 3rd down from the Hawaii 1-yard line, the Warriors drive across midfield and kick a 49-yard field goal. And that’s how the first quarter ends.\nRainbow Warriors 7, Lobos 7: Hawaii drives 80 yards for a touchdown, but UNM’s Carlos Wiggins returns UH’s kickoff 100 yards for a game-tying score. There’s 10:09 left in the first quarter.\nWe’re under way. Hawaii get the ball first, starting from their 25\nGood afternoon/evening from University Stadium, where the New Mexico Lobos (3-3 overall, 1-1 Mountain West Conference) and the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors (2-4, 0-2) will tee it up in about 15 minutes. It’s about 70 degrees with a southerly breeze that, as it is now, should not affect play.\nThere are plenty of good seats still available, with a homecoming crowd of about 22,000 expected.\nThe game will be telecast on ROOT Sports and broadcast on KKOB-AM (770).\nI’ll be blogging here with score changes and updates at the quarter and halftime breaks. I’ll also be tweeting @burquerick.\nEnjoy your Saturday evening, no matter how you choose to spend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:39:11.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
