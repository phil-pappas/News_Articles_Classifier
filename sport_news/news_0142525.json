Freeman, who took over as the starting running back after rookie Tevin Coleman sustained a rib injury in Week 2, has scored six TDs in the last two games. The Falcons improved to 4-0 for only the fourth time in club history. Freeman had touchdown runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards. He set up another score with a 44-yard reception. SAINTS 26, COWBOYS 20, OT NEW ORLEANS — Drew Brees hit C.J. Spiller with a short pass that the running back turned into an 80-yard touchdown — the 400th of the Saints quarterback’s career — on the second play of overtime, and New Orleans won for the first time this season. Brees completed 32 of 39 throws for 279 yards in his return. Mark Ingram gained 126 yards from scrimmage, and Khiry Robinson had a 1-yard TD run for New Orleans (1-3). BENGALS 36, CHIEFS 21 CINCINNATI — Andy Dalton added to his streak of impressive games and big plays, throwing a 55-yard touchdown pass on the run, and Cincinnati stayed unbeaten. The Bengals (4-0) matched the third-best start in franchise history, two wins shy of the club record. PANTHERS 37, BUCCANEERS 23 TAMPA, Fla. — Cam Newton threw for two touchdowns and Josh Norman returned one of Carolina’s four interceptions of Jameis Winston for his second TD of the season. Newton tossed scoring passes of 6 and 12 yards to Ted Ginn Jr. PACKERS 17, 49ERS 3 SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Aaron Rodgers passed for 224 yards and a touchdown, ran 17 yards to set up a key second-half score, and the Packers are off to their first 4-0 start in four years. Richard Rodgers caught a 9-yard touchdown pass on the game’s opening drive before Rodgers got his team going in the second half after a slow beginning to snap a four-game losing streak to San Francisco. BRONCOS 23, VIKINGS 20 DENVER — Brandon McManus kicked a 39-yard field goal with 1:51 left and Denver had seven sacks. Von Miller smothered the loose ball after T.J. Ward’s sack-strip of Teddy Bridgewater in the closing seconds, sealing the win for the unbeaten Broncos (4-0), who got a 72-yard touchdown run from Ronnie Hillman. RAMS 24, CARDINALS 22 GLENDALE, Ariz. — Todd Gurley rushed for all but 2 of 146 yards in the second half and the Rams held on to hand the Cardinals their first loss of the season. Gurley, the Rams’ first-round draft pick, saw his most extensive action as a pro and his 52-yard run set up the winning touchdown. Nick Foles threw for three touchdowns and St. Louis’ defense held the Cardinals (3-1) to field goals on four of five trips inside the red zone. CHARGERS 30, BROWNS 27 SAN DIEGO — Rookie Josh Lambo got his first game-winning kick in the NFL. Given a second chance due to a penalty, Lambo kicked a 34-yard field goal as time expired, lifting the San Diego Chargers to a 30-27 victory against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, snapping a two-game losing streak. Lambo was wide right on a 39-yard attempt with :02 left, but Cleveland’s Tramon Williams was whistled for offside. Lambo then hit his third field goal of the game.

The Dolphins fired coach Joe Philbin this morning after Miami fell to 1-3 on the season.. WASHINGTON 23, EAGLES 20 LANDOVER, Md. — Kirk Cousins threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon with 26 seconds left for Washington. Starting at their own 10 with a little more than six minutes remaining, Washington (2-2) drove 90 yards on 15 plays to take the lead for good in a back-and-forth game. Cousins finished 31 for 46 for 290 yards and no turnovers. Sam Bradford threw three second-half touchdown passes for the Eagles (1-3), but their new kicker, Caleb Sturgis, missed an extra-point attempt and a 33-yard field-goal try. BEARS 22, RAIDERS 20 CHICAGO — Jay Cutler threw for two touchdowns and redeemed himself following an interception by helping set up a 49-yard field goal by Robbie Gould with 2 seconds left for Chicago. The Raiders (2-2) grabbed the lead on a field goal by Sebastian Janikowski with just over two minutes remaining that was set up by an interception by Charles Woodson deep in Oakland territory. Cutler then led Chicago (1-3) from its 20 to the Oakland 32 before Gould nailed the winner. GIANTS 24, BILLS 10 ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Rashad Jennings broke three tackles to score on a 51-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter for New York. Eli Manning went 20 of 35 for 212 yards and three touchdowns for the Giants (2-2). New York’s defense did the rest with Prince Amukamara stripping receiver Robert Woods of the ball to force a fumble with 3:41 left. COLTS 16, JAGUARS 13, OT INDIANAPOLIS — Adam Vinatieri kicked a 27-yard field goal with 4:36 left in overtime to give Indianapolis an NFL record-tying 15th consecutive win over a division opponent. The 1972-73 Miami Dolphins also win 15 straight. Matt Hasselbeck made his first start since November 2012 in place of the injured Andrew Luck, and led the Colts (2-2) on a 53-yard march to step up the winning points.
