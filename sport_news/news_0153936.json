Details, details ... \nIn any event, the curtain rises on the brand new campaign Wednesday night when the Leafs host Carey Price, P.K. Subban and the Montreal Canadiens at the Air Canada Centre. \nWith Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin scheduled to be in the house, coach Mike Babcock will make his regular season debut behind the Leafs bench. How will he fare? \nFor all things, Leafs-Habs, join Sun hockey columnist Mike Zeisberger for our live chat starting at 6:45 p.m. EST.
