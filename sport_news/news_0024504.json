Jackson decided against signing him, but convinced the Greek forward to bypass a lucrative deal in Europe to play for $25,000 in the D-League with Westchester.\nNow, even though he has signed to a partially guaranteed deal, Antetokounmpo still has not gotten a chance to show the havoc he can create on defense through the first three preseason games. The 6-foot-7 defensive specialist and brother of the Greek Freak, Giannis Antetokounmpo, has not played in two of the games and played the final two minutes of another.\nThough he is a slight favorite to land on the roster as 15th man, it’s no given. The Post has learned Antetokounmpo settled for the same $75,000 guarantee as undrafted rookie free agents Darion Atkins, Wesley Saunders and point guard Travis Trice. Antetokounmpo has a non-guaranteed second year attached to the pact.\nHis agents already have said he will not play in the D-League again if not part of the Knicks’ roster. Antetokounmpo said he hopes, if cut, another NBA team will show interest, and Milwaukee comes to mind. Giannis, a budding All-Star, plays for the Bucks, and their parents moved from Greece to Milwaukee. His agents have also spoken to European clubs.\n“First off, hopefully things works out here,’’ Thanasis told The Post. “If they don’t, hopefully another NBA team. That’s the first goal. And after that, we’ll see. Hopefully everything goes well. I don’t want to think about it now. I can control what I can control — being positive and optimistic.’’\nCoach Derek Fisher said with the Knicks playing a back-to-back on Friday and Saturday against Boston and Charlotte, Antetokounmpo, who has a raw offensive game, could see time.\n“He’s shown what we’ve always seen from him — a lot of energy, intensity,’’ Fisher said. “He’s improved as a basketball player. Our roster is constructed in a way it’s tough to break through. Cleanthony Early has gotten better. It makes it rough to find minutes at the forward position.’’\nEarly, Jackson’s first-ever draft pick as 34th selection in 2014, has come back in better shape, looks quicker and less tentative as he tries to erase a dreadful, injury-plagued rookie year.\n“I thought I knew more than I did,’’ Early said at training camp at West Point. “But time definitely gave me a little more wisdom and knowledge.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:20:51.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
