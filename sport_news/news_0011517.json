'It felt really good to go out there to train. When injured, as a new player in the new club in the first practice, it is really difficult. I was very disappointed, but everyone has helped me to keep my head up.' \nOpare was signed to replace compatriot Baba Rahman who was sold to English champions Chelsea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:56:42.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
