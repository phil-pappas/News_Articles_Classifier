The sheriff's office says a suspect stabbed Thor Tuesday during a chase north of Interstate 12 near Mandeville. Deputies later shot and killed suspect Darien Greenwood. The sheriff's office says Thor saved his handler's life when he jumped in between him and Greenwood as Greenwood held a knife. Thor suffered stab wounds to the chest and shoulder. He underwent surgery Wednesday and is expected to make a full recovery. The public is invited to attend Thor's welcome rally at the justice center in downtown Covington beginning at noon.\nNew Orleans midnight basketball enters 10th season\nMayor Mitch Landrieu will join with the New Orleans Pelicans, Domino’s Pizza and PlayNOLA to launch the tenth season of NOLA For Life Midnight Basketball. The program focuses on providing safe recreational opportunities in crime hot spots for young men through the game of basketball. Since the program’s inception, it has reached over 6,000 participants and 2,500 spectators. The mayor and others will officially kick off the season at a news conference later this morning.\nWarmer temps and high humidity return\nA ridge remains in place keeping most rain away from us. An isolated sprinkle is still possible, but that's it today. By Saturday, we could see a 20% chance for a few more showers. Rain chances look greatest by Sunday and Monday as an upper trough develops a surface low along the coast of Texas. This low will send a surge of Gulf and Pacific moisture from Hurricane Patricia toward Southeast Louisiana. This will lead to much needed rainfall! A significant cold front looks to push through by Thursday of next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:43:18.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
