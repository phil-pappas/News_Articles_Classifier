Image 13 of 13 Niskayuna girls' soccer rallies past Columbia 1 / 13 Back to Gallery East Greenbush\nBefore and after her goal, Claire Karafanda offered zero change. That was a little odd, and her Niskayuna soccer teammates playfully called her out for it.\nBut the senior got her point across, tying the score at Columbia quickly in the first half on the way to a 3-1 Suburban Council win Monday.\n\"I just wanted to make sure that we weren't getting too excited,\" Karafanda said, after a short shot and a stoic jog back to midfield. \"We just tied it up. I just wanted us to play off that, and not just settle with that one goal.\"\nTwo more scores in a highly controlled second half helped Niskayuna stay undefeated (9-0-1 in league games), and on pace with Shaker and Shenendehowa — Blue Division rivals that will face each other Thursday afternoon.\n\"I'd like to be in first place,\" Marika Contompasis said.\nIt could happen over the final two weeks of the regular season, on Niskayuna's own merit. The promise starts with the way they attack, starting with the league's leading scorer, Contompasis. She knocked in one (her 13th this season) to close out the scoring with 15 minutes left.\nThat was part of a stellar three-shot sequence over the span of three minutes, during as many unique possessions. She had one go high and the other wide, but both were also major threats.\n\"They have speed. They're physical. They make you pay for every mistake,\" Columbia coach Lisa Johnas said. \"With Marika, it just seems like she's everywhere. Really, they finished. We didn't finish.\"\nThat wasn't the case early.\nColumbia's Caroline Hirt hammered in a goal about midway through the first period. Her coaches expressed urgency to play especially hard for the next five minutes. Coaches at a variety of soccer levels note the universal stat — a significant number of goals come within 300 seconds of the initial one.\nColumbia held on for about half of that.\nThough you wouldn't have guessed it just by seeing Karafanda's reaction. Her look would've had charades contestants guessing offside.\n\"It was the same leading up to the goal, just no emotion — almost dead nothing,\" Silver Warriors coach Bryce Colby said. \"But I really think that's why she scored. She wasn't too (hyper). She was just playing and was focused.\"\nColby was pleased with how Niskayuna pushed forward hard, right after giving up the early goal. It was Karafanda's second goal this season.\nHannah McPartlon added her second goal of the year for a 2-1 Niskayuna lead. It came seven minutes into the second half off a corner kick with a handling error that led to an open shot.\nNiskayuna controlled the rest of the game's most challenging shots, aside from a hard Columbia strike that bounced off a head. It forced goalie Erin Doyle to jump to stop it.\nNiskayuna has outscored opponents 9-4 since a Sept. 21 tie at Guilderland, winning all four games. But Colby says finding another level of focus is crucial.\nSome emotion wouldn't hurt, either, in a difficult stretch that includes matchups next week with Shenendehowa and Shaker — and before that Schenectady (Tuesday) and Saratoga (Thursday). \"We have to treat the upcoming games like playoff games. Just getting ready for that level,\" Contompasis said.\nAs for Karafanda: \"I guess I have to smile more,\" she said, laughing. \"I'll work on that.\"\nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744608/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744606/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744607/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744611/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744604/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744608/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744601/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744602/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744603/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744609/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744602/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744605/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744604/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744610/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744605/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744606/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744603/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744607/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744610/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744612/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744612/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744601/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744611/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/72/8744609/7/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:52:50.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
