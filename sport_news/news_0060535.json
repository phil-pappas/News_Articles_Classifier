Then, Charlotte flipped him to the Grizzlies , the biggest rival of his 2014-15 team, the Clippers. Then came the Barnes feuds. \nHe got into a media confrontation with Serge Ibaka. He got into a real-life one with Knicks coach Derek Fisher. And now, for the second consecutive preseason, he can't make a shot. \nSeriously, Matt Barnes cannot make a basket. And it's a preseason trend. \nAfter going 1-for-6 from the field and 1-for-5 from three (his first exhibition long ball of the year) against the Thunder in his final preseason game, Barnes' preseason shooting ran to 4-for-20. He's also just 1-for-14 from three. \nThis isn't new, though. Barnes had a strong season for the Clippers last year—shooting 44 percent from the field and 36 percent from beyond the arc, the second-best three-point percentage of his career—but his preseason left loads to be desired. \nBarnes made just 3-of-31 field-goal attempts. He sank a mere 1-of-18 triples. \nSo, that brings the newest Grizzlies wing to 7-for-51 (13.7 percent) from the field and 2-for-32 (6.3 percent) from three. \nDo not trust preseason Matt Barnes.
