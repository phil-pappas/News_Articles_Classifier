Bath, the No. 2 seed, upped its record to 8-0 on the season with a pretty dominating defensive effort. The Rams held Letchworth-Warsaw to just 31 yards rushing and another four yards through the air on the day. “The defense came to play today, which is good because we didn’t play our best football game,” Bath head coach Wayne Carroll said. Offensively, Bath sputtered in the early going - turning the ball over on its first two possessions and turning the ball over on downs in its third. “We were not good with the football today. I have no answers,” Carroll said. “In my pregame speech, I told them that the football was worth a million dollars, so don’t let go of it.” Bath did hold an 8-0 lead before its offense even took the field when Patrick Brewer caught a punt in full stride and ran it back 50 yards for a touchdown with 9:39 left in the first quarter following a defensive stop. That was a help as the Rams’ offense had difficulty finding its traction in the early going. After the first two possessions ended with fumbles, the Rams were stopped on downs on the Letchworth/Warsaw four yard line. “We had three drives stall immediately - and that’s not like us,” Carroll said. “Our running backs didn’t have a good day. Normally our running backs break tackles and get more yards.” The Rams’ first offensive touchdown came on a five-play drive that covered 55 yards. Brewer carried two times for 35 yards before Tyler Finch made the end zone from one yard away. Michael Rice led the way to Bath’s next touchdown, with runs of 18 and 42 yards as the Rams upped their lead to 22-0 with 1:06 before halftime. Bath opened the third quarter with its third fumble of the contest, but returned to form with touchdowns on its next three possessions. Connor DiDomineck scored touchdowns of 1 and 2 yards, followed by a Stefan Ordway 2-yard run. Brewer finished with 129 yards on 11 carries for Bath, followed by 99 yards on nine totes by Rice. Finch closed the day with 77 yards on seven tries. Rice also connected with Jake Taggart on two passes that went for 44 yards total as the Rams gained 419 yards of total offense. Mike Galton led Letchworth-Warsaw with 21 yards on 14 carries. Next up for the Rams will be No. 6 LeRoy in the semifinals, to be played Oct. 31 at 4 p.m. at Honeoye Falls-Lima. LeRoy (5-3) downed No. 2 Attica 20-19 Friday.
