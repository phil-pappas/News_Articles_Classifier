That’s our game, that’s who we are. It’s nice that we score more goals than we have in the past, it’s nice that we have more skill. But that stuff doesn’t matter unless we’re a good defensive team.”\nHome teams get the last line change, so home coaches have the advantage when it comes to matchups. But if Yeo has trust in all his players, this could bode well on the road when Yeo doesn’t have as much control of matchups.\nMaybe this is one reason why the Wild, which won a franchise-record 24 road games last season and is off to a 1-0 start this year heading into a three-game trip to Arizona, Los Angeles and Anaheim, was 16-2-2 on the road after Devan Dubnyk’s arrival last season.\nAt one point, the Wild won a franchise-record 12 in a row away from St. Paul.\n“The better you are defensively, the more we trust them, the more we don’t have to hide certain players, the more we don’t have to seek out certain matchups,” Yeo said. “We can just roll our lines more and get more flow to our game.”\nZach Parise, tied for the league lead with four goals, loves it.\n“We’re comfortable playing any line against anyone, and I think that’s going to pay off for us,” Parise said. “If Mike’s able to play the fourth line against top lines, it opens up so much for everyone else and creates mismatches.”\nYeo and Parise say it comes down to the way the Wild’s built. Like many teams in today’s NHL, the Wild doesn’t have a so-called shutdown line. The goal is to have three lines that can skate, score, play solid defensively and then a strong fourth line that can be fast, physical and tight defensively.\n“In 2005 when I came in, which isn’t long ago, you had half your team that were good skaters, and the other half, or the 4, 5, 6 defensemen, they couldn’t really skate,” Parise said. “Now you can’t play if you can’t skate. The game has really evolved like that.”\nStructure session\nWith four days between Saturday’s game and Thursday’s at Arizona, Yeo held a hard practice Sunday designed to bring structure to the Wild’s game he felt was missing the first two games of the season.\n“The guys put the work in today, and that’s what we needed,” Yeo said. “I knew the guys would be tired, but you have to grind through it, and this gives us a full day and a half of rest now [with Monday off].\n“We did a lot of good things to be 2-0, but we should also not be satisfied with that. There’s a lot of areas we can be better.”\nAches and pains\nThe Wild was shorthanded in practice Sunday because banged-up left wing Zucker was given a maintenance day and center Tyler Graovac is sidelined with what’s believed to be an aggravated hip flexor injury.\nTo get through practice, Ryan Carter took Zucker’s spot on the Koivu-Niederreiter line and defenseman Nate Prosser was a place-holder for Carter at right wing on the fourth line.\nJustin Fontaine, who missed the first two games with an oblique injury, skated with Thomas Vanek and Charlie Coyle.\nYeo said if Graovac can’t practice Tuesday, he’d be questionable for Thursday’s game. If he can’t practice Tuesday or Wednesday, he’s likely out Thursday and Friday.\nGoalie lineup\nYeo said Dubnyk, the former Coyotes goalie, will make his first start at Arizona since the Jan. 14 trade to Minnesota. He’ll be shooting for his 100th career victory. Dubnyk’s Wild home debut last season was against the Coyotes. He stopped 25 of 26 shots in a win.\nDarcy Kuemper is slated to make his season debut Friday at Los Angeles. In two games (one start) at the Staples Center, Kuemper is 1-0 with a 0.99 goals-against average and .962 save percentage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:20:46.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
