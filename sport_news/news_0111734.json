Villaruel   24, 2015 - 12:00am \nCEBU, Philippines - Six teams will strut their wares in the commercial division of the 6th Carcar City Mayor's Cup basketball tournament set to kick off on November 4 at the Carcar Sports Complex. \nThe University of the Visayas Green Lancers, runner-up to the University of San Carlos Warriors in the recently-concluded 15th Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. (CESAFI) season, lead the cast of contenders in the week-long tilt that dangles over P100,000 in cash prize to the top performers. \nThe rest of the entries are Joemangs, Abrenica Engineering, Aspa Formworks, Paolo Luna Beach Resort, and Espina Agrivet. \n\"I would like to extend my profound gratitude to the participating teams for their continued support to our tournament all these years. Without them, this would not have been possible,\" said Carcar Mayor Nice Apura during the formal launching of the event yesterday at Sunburst-Mango. \nLeague commissioner Julie Flores, who also graced the affair, said each team is allowed to field in only one foreign import. \nThe competing squads are divided into two brackets, of which they will play in a single round robin formal in the elimination. The top two qualifiers will figure in a double crossover semifinals. The winners will then clash for the championship in a winner-take-all affair.   \nThe champion will take home a P50,000 paycheck, while the second and third will pocket P30,000 and P20,000, respectively. The fourth placer will get a consolation prize of P10,000 .
