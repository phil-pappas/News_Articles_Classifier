(Nick Potts/PA via AP) UNITED KINGDOM OUT - NO SALES - NO ARCHIVES \nBIRMINGHAM, England (AP) — Stoke won a Premier League match away from home for the first time since February as midfielder Marko Arnautovic scored in a 1-0 victory against Aston Villa on Saturday. \nThe Potters’ previous league away win came in Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood’s first game in charge. \nArnautovic had already seen a goal disallowed in the first half while Charlie Adam’s audacious 60-yard lob almost had the visitors in front after 18 minutes. The midfielder scored from 60 yards at Chelsea last season and nearly beat a frantic Brad Guzan. \nArnautovic won it when poor defending from the hosts cost them after 55 minutes. \nAdam and Glen Johnson combined before the defender threaded the ball through to Arnautovic, who fired in his second goal of the season, off the post. \nVilla remains in the relegation zone with four points from eight matches. Stoke has nine points. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:01:35.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
