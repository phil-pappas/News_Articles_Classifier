Winless a year ago, now winners of two straight, including an emotional victory two weeks ago against New London. This, however, is the deepest end of the pool in the conference. NFA is among the league’s most talented teams and with the fastest (if not best) player in the league: quarterback Jawaun Johnson. The winner of this game keeps pace with Bacon Academy undefeated in the ECC Large Division. \nStonington at Waterford, 6:30 p.m. \nRecords : Stonington (0-4, 0-2 ECC Small); Waterford (0-3, 0-2) \nLast week : Stonington lost to Bacon Academy 18-6; Waterford was idle. \nOutlook : The good news: Barring the unlikely event of a tie, someone gets its first win of the season. The Bears played likely their best game of the year last week, remaining competitive with unbeaten Bacon Academy. Can they ride some of the momentum? Waterford was idle last week, following a forgettable loss at Killingly two weeks ago. Both teams expected more. Here’s their chance to salvage their seasons. \nMontville at New London, 6:30 p.m. \nRecords : Montville (2-1); New London (1-3). \nLast week : Montville was idle; New London lost to Ledyard 35-6 \nOutlook : New London has lost three straight, scoring but 31 points in its last three games. The Whalers are searching for some consistency on offense and defense. Sophomore quarterback Melquan Gomez has had his moments — the 50-yard run against Ledyard last week comes to mind — but the Whalers’ trouble scoring has been a season-long issue. Montville’s strength is its defense, perhaps making this a low-scoring game. \nGranby at Valley/Old Lyme, 6:30 p.m. \nRecords : Granby (4-0), Valley/OL (2-2) \nLast week : Granby defeated Lewis Mills 52-6; Valley/OL defeated North Branford 27-21 in double-overtime \nOutlook : Valley-Old Lyme gets to see one of the state’s top players this week: Granby senior Connor Field, who has 607 rushing yards and 74 points in four games. (He’s also the son of NBC Connecticut meteorologist Brad Field). Granby has allowed 12 points all season. Valley/Old Lyme won an emotional game last week against North Branford, three days after the death of George King, father of Valley coach Tim King. … This game will be televised on CPTV Sports. \nSaturday’s game \nWilcox Tech at Thames River, 1 p.m. \nRecords : Wilcox Tech (1-3, 1-3 Constitution State Conference); Thames River (1-3, 1-3) \nLast week : Wilcox Tech lost to Quinebaug 22-6; Thames River lost to Capital/AF 54-6 \nOutlook : Things should get easier for Thames Valley this week after two weeks of Harding and Capital/AF. Wilcox Tech has scored a combined 15 points in its four games this season. Thames River has scored 92.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:40:42.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
