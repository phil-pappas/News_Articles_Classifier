Moments later, he planted an energy-sapping body shot that floored Gonzales for the first time. \nHowever, referee Jack Reiss deducted Pagara a point for throwing a punch after the break. After being given five minutes to recover, Gonzalez was further saved by the bell.   \nIn the third, the two fighters figured in a torrid exchange although it was Pagara who landed more solid hits. Gonzales became aggressive towards the end of the fourth only to be rocked by Pagara’s powerful right hook. \nSustaining his momentum, Pagara pounded Gonzales with a string of right hooks to the head, but the Nicaraguan showed iron nerves in withstanding the onslaught. \nAt that point though, it was very clear that it’s only a matter of time before Gonzales will meet his end. \nFired up by the warm cheers of the pro-Filipino crowd, Pagara capped his spectacular showing by unleashing a brutal left-straight combination to the head that sent Gonzales down at the seat of his pants for good at the 2:20 mark of round six. \nEarlier, Albert’s older brother Jason Pagara was also a sight to behold for the large throng of Fil-Am spectators. \nAfter a blazing start, Jason Pagara dropped Benavides three times in the second round for a resounding TKO victory. \nIn a splendid display of punching power, Jason Pagara first decked Benavides with a left hook to the head. He then downed his foe with a right uppercut to the breadbasket before eventually finishing him off with a left hook-right straight combo. \nJason Pagara now holds a 37-2 win-loss record laced with 23KOs, while Benavides fell to 27-6-2 (19KOs). — EBV (FREEMAN)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:34:53.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
