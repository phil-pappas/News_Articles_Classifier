He laughed at it, and said 'oh, time flies'.\" \nPetti was immersed in rugby from the age of five at the fabled San Isidro club, where Dr Francisco Ocampo devised Argentina's much-vaunted \"Bajada\" scrum technique. \nDespite quitting rugby for tennis for two years in his teens, Petti admitted he only ever dreamed of making it into the San Isidro first XV, to follow in his father's footsteps. \nWhile plenty of youngsters idolise world superstars, Petti revealed his childhood role model as Brian Anthony, a loose-forward who starred at San Isidro for more than a decade. \nThat amateur ethos continues to course through the humble veins of Argentina's passionate but focused squad, with Petti already excelling at Test level despite barely being out of his teens. \n\"I never thought in 2007 I would be at this World Cup as a player,\" said Petti. \" That was just a dream back then. \n\"All I was thinking about was playing for San Isidro. \n\"That was my objective in those days. \n\"My father took me to San Isidro, where he played. \n\"The player I liked most growing up was Brian Anthony, who played at my club. He was the guy I looked up to growing up. \n\"Last Sunday I found him in the crowd at the Ireland game, so that was very nice.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:20:09.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
