The Ministry has asked the tennis federation to follow the age and tenure guidelines in accordance with the National Sports Development Code (NSDC) or lose government funding. The Ministry’s tough stand has come nearly a fortnight after The Tribune reported about the notice issued to Judo Federation of India (JFI) president Mukesh Kumar on similar grounds. As Khanna has not served a cooling-off period after serving three consecutive terms as the AITA secretary general and before taking over as the president, the Law Ministry, which the Sports Ministry approached, found sufficient reasons to recommend action against him and the tennis body. Knowing AITA’s hard stand on age and tenure issue, the showdown between the Ministry and AITA looks imminent. The tennis body has always stood by Khanna and had threatened to take a legal recourse in the past against any such directive. Reacting to Ministry’s notice, AITA CEO Hironmoy Chatterjee said, “Let us receive the notice, we will then decide what to do.” A senior Ministry official informed that AITA’s possible suspension will not affect the funding of the tennis players. The official said the Ministry will directly fund tennis players as it has been funding Indian archers after the Archery Association of India (AAI) was suspended in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:26:58.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
