The Brazilian ace appears to have put an end to speculations about his future at the La Liga giants just weeks after he revealed that talks were held between his representatives and Manchester United over the summer. \nGlobo Esporte reported in the finals days of the summer transfer window that Louis van Gaal were launching a €190m (£140m) bid to make Neymar his marquee signing of the summer. The Guardian later added fuel to speculation by claiming that the former Santos star was open to move to Old Trafford. United signed Anthony Martial from Monaco instead on deadline day but later last month Neymar reignited the speculations after confirming the approach from the Premier League giants. \n\"We had conversations, but there was nothing concrete, I heard that there were offers, but none made it to me,\" Neymar said in an interview with ESPN Brazil . \nEarlier this week Barcelona football director, Robert Fernandez, tried to play down the rumours by revealing that the club are working to offer Neymar a new lucrative deal in order to keep the Brazilian international at the at the club for \"the rest of his life\" . \nNeymar has now sent a reassuring message to the Catalan fans claiming that he is happier than ever at the club alongside his friends Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. Youtube / FC Barcelona \n\"I want to continue making history in Barcelona; I want to win more titles,\" he said to Barcelona TV after reaching his 100th official appearance. \"I changed my game and my life, both for the better since arrived to the club. The city helps me a lot and I'm very happy.\" \n\"My adaptation to the team has come quite easily. I did get a lot of help — from the Club, my teammates, the city, my family…\" he added. \"We had a (last) great season winning the treble, and this (season) is more difficult. We have to do more than we have been to beat our opponents.\" \nWhile speaking about his special relationship with Messi and Suarez, he added: \"I think we surprised people. Some said we wouldn't get along well, but I knew they were wrong.\" More about Neymar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:43:58.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
