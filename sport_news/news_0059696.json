Wilson is leading the country in ESPN's quarterback ranking system through the first month of the season. \nThen the Utes ran into the Cal Bears. \nThough the Utes escaped with a victory, they struggled to move the ball through the air, instead feeding star running back Devontae Booker to the tune of 222 yards on the ground. The Utes turned the ball over three times, and despite six turnovers, Cal had the ball with time running out and a chance to win the game. \nWhat was the difference with Cal? \nThe Bears prepared for Utah like it was the biggest game of their season, and Utah better get used to it. \nTo this point in their Pac-12 lives, the Utes have been an always tough, occasionally dangerous afterthought in the eyes of conference foes. In Salt Lake City, they were a serious threat to compete, bolstered by thin air and a ruckus crowd. On the road, they were well-prepared, but occasionally disappointing, having won only five road games in the previous three seasons of conference play. \nNow, the Utes have targets firmly on their backs, and the fight they got from Cal will increase with every game and every win. \nThe Arizona State Sun Devils, who the Utes face this weekend, have been mostly disappointing this season with the exception of a win over UCLA. The Bruins, at the time of their loss to ASU, were ranked seventh in the country, and like Utah now, had become a target for an opponent's season-defining win.

Gary Andersen's Oregon State Beavers might be the worst team in the Pac-12, but they will surely get up for a game against their head coach's former employer. Then a run of games against Washington, UCLA and Arizona will likely feature teams competing for bowl appearances and conference championships. \nWhittingham has been able to play the underdog card for his team throughout his Pac-12 career, noting their past lives in the Mountain West Conference, with largely under-recruited athletes compared to their conference counterparts. But as the only remaining undefeated team in the conference, the Utes now bear the burden of the heaviest crown. \nWhile it's nice for Utah to hang its hat on victories over Michigan, Cal and Oregon, how will they handle the pressure from opponents hoping to define their seasons with a win over the frontrunning Utes.
