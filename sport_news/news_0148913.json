That came after Matthews sacked Kaepernick in the third quarter and mocked the 49ers star’s trademark biceps-kissing celebration.\nMatthews said after the game that the celebration was all in fun.\n“Nah, it’s not planned,” Matthews said. “I was going to hit him with the predator, and then I had a light bulb go off in my head. It’s just having fun. We’re a bunch of kids out there running around and having fun at each other’s expense.”\nHowever, Matthews was not asked about the Wilson comparison.\nKaepernick finished 13-of-25 passing for 160 yards and an interception. He rushed for 57 yards on 10 carries. A downbeat Kaepernick took responsibility for the loss after the game and insisted the team will improve.\n“The only way I know how to fix things is to go back to work,” Kaepernick told reporters. “We have to find our rhythm.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:24:03.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
