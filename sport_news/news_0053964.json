And when old rivals face each other in a postseason series for the first time Friday, he'll be pitching against an old buddy.

No accident people running into each other this time of year.\" \nLackey had a career-best 2.77 ERA and consistently went deep for the 100-win Cardinals, stepping up as the de facto ace after Adam Wainwright tore his left Achilles in late April.

That condition was met when he missed 2012 while recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery. \nSt. Louis acquired him from the Red Sox on July 31, 2014. Lackey can become a free agent again this fall. Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Jon Lester blows a bubble during an NLDS baseball practice Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, in St. Louis.

Lester was 2-0 with a 0.59 ERA and Lackey won the clincher. \n\"He was probably the best on the planet going through the playoffs that year,\" Lackey said. \"He knows how to compete and he knows how to handle this time of year, for sure.\" \nLester will try to follow an excellent wild-card performance by Jake Arrieta, who threw a four-hitter Wednesday night in a 4-0 victory over the Pirates. \nLester figured he'd be matched against 17-game winner Michael Wacha, but the right-hander was 2-3 with a 7.78 ERA the final month and will start Game 3. When Lester learned he would be opposed by Lackey, he thought it funny — and fitting. \n\"He's going to almost out-will you sometimes, if that makes sense,\" Lester said. \"Our friendship will go beyond this game, will go beyond this career, but come tomorrow, we're not buddies anymore.\" \nKyle Hendricks (8-7, 3.95) will oppose Jaime Garcia (10-6, 2.43) in Game 2 Saturday. Arrieta (22-6, 1.77), having a breakout Cy Young-caliber season, faces Wacha (17-7, 3.38) in Game 3 and in Game 4 it will be St. Louis' Lance Lynn (12-11, 3.03) against probably Jason Hammel (10-7, 3.74). \nThousands of fans regularly make the trek north or south and do their utmost to make the visitors feel right at home. \n\"I didn't even realize this was the first time we had met in the postseason,\" said Cubs manager Joe Maddon, who spoke reverently about the Cardinals tradition during earlier trips to Busch Stadium. \"I thought that was kind of interesting, but then again it's believable if you look at how this thing plays out.\" \n\"It's going to be bumping tomorrow, regardless of who's winning,\" Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong said. \"And when we go to Wrigley, we know that stadium is going to be bumping for sure.\" \nThe pre-game workout was newsworthy for the Cardinals, who saw enough from All-Star catcher Yadier Molina that they believe he can be effective behind the plate wearing a hard plastic molded splint to protect a strained left thumb ligament. The thumb will be wrapped for at-bats. \nMolina was injured tagging out the Cubs' Anthony Rizzo sliding into the plate on Sept. 20 in Chicago. \nMaddon said he'd wait until game day to announce any roster changes but promised no major wrinkles. \n\"It's not going to be dramatically different, promise you,\" Maddon said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:46:36.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
