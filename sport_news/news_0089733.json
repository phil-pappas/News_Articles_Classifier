(AP) â€” Louisville coach Rick Pitino vows to Cardinals fans that he \"will not resign and let you down\" as investigations continue into an escort's book allegations that one of his former staffers hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players.\nIn a season preview Thursday on his website, the Hall of Fame coach apologized to fans for having to \"endure the pain\" of allegations by Katina Powell that Andre McGee paid strippers to perform 22 shows from 2010-14 at the players' dormitory.\nThe 63-year-old Pitino has denied knowledge of the activities described in Powell's book and said Thursday, \"someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years but that time is not now. I do not fight these accusations by others but rather turn the other cheek.\"\nMuhammad Ali tweeted his support for the school from the boxing great's personal and fan Twitter accounts Thursday evening, saying, \"From one champion to another, I will always stand behind and support UofL. GoCards! #UniteLouisville.\"\nPitino's latest comments come two days after Powell broke her silence after the release earlier this month of \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.\" Powell told ESPN's \"Outside The Lines\" program that she had no proof the coach knew McGee paid her $10,000 to arrange the shows that took place in the players' Billy Minardi Hall dorm.\nBut Powell said in the interview that Pitino had to be aware of the shows and added that with \"a boatload\" of recruits and dancers, \"loud music, alcohol, security, cameras\" in a campus dorm, \"how could Rick not know?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:38:28.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
