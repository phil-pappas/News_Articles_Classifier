(AP) - A supplemental insurance contract for all state workers might cost less and provide better coverage for services including dental and vision work, but contracts are fragmented among more than 100 state agencies plus school districts and higher education entities, The Clarion-Ledger ( http://on.thec-l.com/1FZ3Y4i ) reports.\nThere's also no requirement for competitive bidding or to get proposals for the best price or coverage.\nAnd some Mississippi-based insurance companies say they're being shut out in a process that is not very transparent, open for competition or regulated for fairness.\nSince state employees pay most of the cost of supplemental insurance and \"cafeteria plans,\" the issue has mostly stayed off state leaders' radar. The only recent legislative push, for consolidated dental coverage, was fought by agency leaders and individual insurance agents.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
