Tilton & Will Schneekloth/Getty Images FOX Sports Jared Turner - Shake and Bake Crew Share This Story Updated Oct 5, 2015 at 2:57p ET \nSunday's Chase elimination race at Dover International Speedway wasn't just stressful for the drivers involved. It was also stressful for their significant others. \nHow do we know? \nSeveral WAGs -- most notably Amy Reimann (fiancee of Dale Earnhardt Jr .), Samantha Busch (wife of Kyle Busch ), Sherry Pollex (girlfriend of Martin Truex Jr .), Lorra Bowyer (wife of Clint Bowyer ) and DeLana Harvick (wife of race winner Kevin Harvick ) -- used Twitter on Sunday to make their voices heard. \nNot surprisingly, the emotions expressed by the WAGs ranged from jubilant to nervous to downright ticked off in the case of Pollex, who was clearly steamed about NASCAR ordering her boyfriend to start at the back after issues in pre-race inspection. \nHere's a sampling of what they had to say: true ‚Äî Amy Reimann (@Amy_Reimann) October 4, 2015 Holy moly that was too stressful!
