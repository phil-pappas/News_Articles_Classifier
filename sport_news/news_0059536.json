The last 15 minutes were more like the way we play. I don't know what it was. The kids were certainly nervous,\" noted the coach. \"We played well enough to win. We scored three nice goals.\" \nMcDonald simply took over down the stretch. He turned on the jets to get off three consecutive shots that were denied by Randolph keeper Henry Kidder and then made a beautiful cross. He used his speed during a run along the left side before burying a shot to make it 2-0 with 14:13 left and headed home a corner feed 10 minutes later to cap the scoring. \nNick Morrow made nine saves to get the shutout, but was never really tested. The biggest threat for Randolph was Nathan Gray â€” a beast of a forward who unloaded four powerful shots from long range in Morrow's direction. Advertisement \n\"Come on white, where's the intensity?\" shouted the Leland & Gray keeper during the first half. \n\"Pick it up!\" screamed coach Barton. \nThe first half was difficult for the large home crowd to watch, aside from pretty passes by Patrick McDonald and Bryce Karg, scoring chances for Cody Cutler and Jullian Plumadore, and Evan Daigneault's rebound goal that gave the hosts a 1-0 lead at the 28:12 mark. \nLeland & Gray's defense was pretty solid, however. With a steady beat coming from drums along the sideline, Patrick McDonald picked Gray's pocket and Jeremy Bovat cleared the ball out of danger a couple of times. \n\"Bovat played really well for us in the back. He was probably our player of the game,\" stated Barton. \nAfter trying to fire his teammates up during a halftime huddle, Morrow had to make four stops early in the second half to keep the Rebels on top. He denied Gray twice, caught a shot from Liam Connolly and saved one off the foot of Dakota Garrow. \nThat's when Owen McDonald began using his gift, as he continually accelerated so that he could get off shots and added a couple of insurance goals. \nThe Rebels will host No. 13 Thetford in Friday's quarterfinal at 3 p.m. Thetford upset No. 4 Williamstown, 3-0, on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:38:35.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
