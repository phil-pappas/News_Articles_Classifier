We just want to get out there and do the best we can.\"\nThe Irish will not be held prisoners to what happened the five times they have been able to get to the quarter-final, but no further.\n\"We've got a chance to make history,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is focussed on preparing extremely well and now it's about going out there and having no regrets after the game.\"\nThe 30-year-old Ulsterman knows this is a crossroads moment in the career of many.\n\"It only comes around every four years.\n\"Of course, we know this won't happen again for a lot of us.\"\nHe won't dwell on the negatives, on the possibilities.\n\"We just have to go about the same process and use it for motivation.\n\"We won't be burdened by the past.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:00:03.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
