Dabney Stadium in Leesburg. Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 6:00 pm Leesburg's homecoming took an ugly turn Friday night PAUL JENKINS paul.jenkins@dailycommercial.com dailycommercial.com | 0 comments \nWith three minutes left in Leesburg High’s homecoming game against Lakeland Lake Gibson on Friday night, Yellow Jackets coach Doug Allison called his assistant coaches down from the press box because he wanted all of his coaches on the field. \nLeesburg was down 25-13 and Lake Gibson had the ball. A game that had been physical from the start — with Yellow Jackets quarterback Wyatt Rector roughly thrown to the ground out of bounds on the second play of the game — was threatening to take an even uglier turn. \n“I said I need my coaches on the sideline,” Allison said Saturday. “I tried to take out any of my players who were involved in any extracurricular activities and even some who weren’t. I take full responsibility for my team, but I really feel the officials could have called some more penalties in those last three minutes to try and keep control.” \nWith Leesburg trying to make a goal-line stand in the final seconds, things finally boiled over. In a game where two teams had been jawing at each other throughout, tempers reached the breaking point. \nAt that point Allison and his coaches rushed to the end zone to try and break things up. Allison said two players came off the Leesburg bench, with one clearly trying to break things up on the field. Lake Gibson coaches stayed on their sideline and made sure none of their players left the bench. \n“My immediate thought was we had to get some coaches down there to break it up,” Allison said. “It was on our sideline and that’s why we went down there. If it had been on their sideline, we would have done the same thing they did. \nThe Florida High School Athletic Association will review film from the incident and likely hand out suspensions, including for any Leesburg players who left the bench. Allison expects to hear from the FHSAA about any punishments by Monday at the earliest or Wednesday at the latest. \nAllison made the decision at that point to pull his team off the field with 22 seconds left in the game. Coaches began leading the team to the locker room behind the stadium. Many in the Leesburg crowd began to surge toward the back of the stadium, anticipating something happening between the teams away from the field. \n“One of the things we try to teach is discipline and some people think I should have kept the team on the field,” Allison said. “Then their players and spectators started jeering our team. The officials asked our team to go back out for another snap and that’s when whatever happened behind the stadium happened. \n“There was a surge (toward the Lake Gibson team). I know there were a lot of non-participants back there and I was told a lot of spectators were jumping the fence. I know my coaches grabbed two or three of our players, but the vast majority of our kids did what we asked them to do.” \nThe incident proved to be a bad ending for an otherwise entertaining game as Leesburg hung in against a big, physical opponent. \n“I’ve been wrestling with what happened since I left the stadium about midnight last night and wondering what I should have done differently,” Allison said. “Losing is not a good feeling, but it’s not the worst feeling. That’s when sportsmanship fails.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:19:26.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
