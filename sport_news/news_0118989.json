He came through training camp fine, despite a few big hits in preseason games, and is beginning to feel like his old self on the ice again.\nBut the brain and head injuries, the result of being hit by teammate Ryan McDonagh’s shot in the first round of last spring’s playoffs, did change him in one way — it taught him how much he should cherish the ability to play the sport he loves for a living.\n“Things can happen quickly,” said Zuccarello, who was hospitalized for four days, was temporarily unable to speak and had lost feeling in his left arm as a result of the puck to the head. “You have to enjoy it, not just being on the ice, but being here with the guys. Just enjoy everything. You never know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I try to tell myself that. Have fun as long as it lasts, and hopefully it lasts for a long time. At the same time, you never know.\n“I told myself this year I’m not going to get mad at myself, but after the first game I was mad at myself.”\nHis anger has subsided of late. His past two games have been much better, two goals in a come-from-behind 4-2 win over the Blue Jackets on Friday and the physical and active two-way play that have typified his career on Broadway.\n“I feel OK, I feel like my timing is getting there a little bit,” the gritty 28-year-old Norwegian said. “I’m starting to feel better about myself.\n“I’m happy. Obviously, I thought it was going to take me a little longer. I feel like I’m getting better and better.”\nRangers coach Alain Vigneault publicly criticized his first line after the opener, feeling they had more to give. He has high hopes for the Zuccarello-Rick Nash-Derick Brassard trio, which has come alive since the coach’s pointed remarks.\n“I think that line is on the upswing,” Vigneault said. “They’ve all had moments where one of them or two of them have been real good, but there always seems to be one guy is just off on his execution.\n“I’ve got so much belief in those three players, as far as the way they can play at both ends of the rink, be effective defensively and we all know what they can do offensively.\n“So my expectations for what they can bring to us on a daily basis, practice and games, is higher than what I’ve seen so far.”\nVigneault said he sees the same Zuccarello he saw his first two seasons as the Rangers coach, aside from some timing issues that most players struggle with early in the season, particularly ones coming off such a serious issues.\n“I think Mats is on the right track here,” Vigneault said.\nZuccarello doesn’t have any individual goals. He would, of course, like to improve on his regular-season numbers from a year ago — 15 goals, 34 assists and 49 points, down from the 19-40-59 he produced in 2013-14.\nBut what’s important to him is helping the Rangers get back to the Stanley Cup final after having to watch them come so agonizingly closer last year in a seven-game series loss to the Lightning in the Eastern Conference final.\n“I wish I could be a part of that,” he said.\nHe has another chance, a chance that was in doubt last spring. Zuccarello wants to make the most of it.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under alain vigneault ,  mats zuccarello ,  new york rangers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:32:51.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
