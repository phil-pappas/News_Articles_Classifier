The broadcast begins Saturday at 9:00 a.m. from James Madison's campus on the Quad in front of Wilson Hall and airs until noon, prior to JMU's homecoming game against Richmond. Kick off is set for 3:30 p.m. and the game will be broadcast on Comcast SportsNet. \nAll visitors for College GameDay are welcome and admission is free. A 500-spectator pit area will be located immediately behind the College GameDay set and will be available only to JMU students with a valid JACard beginning at 6:30 a.m. All other fans will be invited to fill in the large lawn areas of the quad. While overnight congregating is welcome, no tents or camping will be allowed on the Quad or anywhere else on campus. \nThe show will be viewable on large video screens with sound system. Signs are a favorite part of many fans of the show and will be viewable on ESPN from all areas of the quad. Guests are asked to refrain from derogatory or political messages or any references to .com’s or other websites. \nESPN will also air other programming from the Quad on Friday and Saturday, beginning with live spots with Sam Ponder as early as 9 a.m.on Friday. Other set features will be filmed later Friday morning. Friday’s 30-minute College Football Live program will air at 2 p.m. from the Quad with a gathering of fans welcome in the Pit area. There will be additional SportsCenter live shots Friday evening and beginning 7 a.m.Saturday leading up to the 9 a.m. airing of College GameDay. \nHead coach Everett Withers says, \"I think this is really exciting for our fans, our Alums and everybody coming back. I think its really exciting. Its exciting for CAA football. GameDay doesn't come here if they don't have two really good teams. Hats off to our players and coaches for both schools. I'm really proud of the way our football team has handled the first seven games of the season. We're going to handle week eight the exact same way.\" \nJMU Athletic Director Jeff Bourne says, \"I'm hoping its 12,00 people. I know we're going to get a great student turnout. That buzz is already going on in the student body. We talked about how we're going to handle the students that are going to get an opportunity to be in that pit area. I've had emails and texts this morning from fans who've said 'I don't have tickets to the game but I'm going to come to this event. I like when Lee Corso has to put that Duke Dog hat on Saturday. That's working for me. We'll make sure that we have one of those.\" \nThe Dukes (7-0) rank 3rd in the FCS, while the Spiders (5-1) rank 11th. James Madison is coming off a 51-0 win at Elon. The margin of victory over Elon was the largest on the road in the program's history. JMU's Vad Lee was featured on ESPN earlier this year, as part of its 'Big Man on Campus' segment. Lee is among the favorites to win the FCS player of the year. \nJames Madison defeated FBS opponent SMU earlier this season. It was the Mustangs homecoming game. The Dukes currently own the second longest regular season winning streak in the country with 14 straight wins.
