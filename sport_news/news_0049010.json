Lane Tufts led the way with 165 yards and three touchdowns — from 53, 26 and 11 yards out —on 12 carries. However, he wouldn’t take any credit for his success. \n\"It was our O-line,\" said Tufts, who also caught two passes for 41 yards. \"I gotta give a shoutout to Brett Desender, Mack Pardy, Erik Plante, Von Cook and Michael Cullen. They get the upfront push, they tell me where to go and I follow them. It’s all them. \n\"I felt more comfortable running it. The line really got a push. It’s all the line. I just follow them.\" \nNeelin dominated right from the start. \nTufts scored his first touchdown three minutes 17 seconds into the game and Dayton Black hit paydirt on the last play of the opening quarter. Clark Nachtigall added a two-point convert to make it 14-0. \nTufts scored two more majors in the second quarter and Eric Jenkins also broke the plane to make is 32-0 at the break. \nBlack scored on an 18-yard run in the third and Tufts kicked the first convert of the season for Neelin to round out its scoring. \nThe Spartans’ defence was steady after allowing an early drive. \nIt shut out the Hornets (0-4) until there was less than six minutes left in the game when Tec Voc connected on a 19-yard pass. \n\"They played well,\" Neelin head coach Robert Cullen said about his defence. \"Other than the 55 yards on the one drive in penalties, they calmed down and stopped them at the eight and we drove the ball down. It was great by the defence. They did some good things. \n\"We just have to shore up our secondary because teams are just going to keep picking them apart.\" \nDexter Jenkins led the defence with eight tackles and two assists, while Lincoln Zentner and Dominik Penner both had three tackles and a sack. Konnor Chelkowski chipped in with three tackles and two assists. \nBlack completed eight of 15 passes for 142 yards and two interceptions. Dawson Harris caught two of those passes for 39 yards while Clark Nachtigall hauled in three for 37. \nCullen was very proud of his team’s effort. In the two previous weeks, the Spartans had played well through three quarters but struggled in the fourth and came away with losses. He hopes Wednesday’s game will give the team a boost for its next game against the visiting St. John’s Tigers (1-1) on Oct. 8 at 4 p.m., which will be Neelin’s alumni game. \n\"I hope it builds enough confidence that we’ll be successful in the rest of the year,\" Cullen said. \"We just have to take one game at a time. St. John’s is big and they have a couple decent linemen so we have to go out and play tough.\" \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:55:25.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
