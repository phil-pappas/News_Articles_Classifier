Well, those days are gone, and so are those kickers. So, let’s get right to the point. Or perhaps I should say the three points. Either way, the point is that it’s time for the NFL to move the goal posts closer together. Because kicking field goals has become too easy. Scoring three points has become almost automatic, rather than an accomplishment. Not for everybody, mind you. Hey, I feel your pain, Josh Scobee. I’m sorry you’re out of a job, Zach Hocker. And, yes, Kyle Brindza, you certainly proved that kicking field goals isn’t as easy as it looks. But those guys are the exception these days, not the rule. For the most part, NFL kickers have become exceptional at booting the ball consistently through the uprights. Kicking a field goal from inside 50 yards, and even a bit beyond, has become almost routine. Missing one — and, certainly, two – can leave a kicker seeking other employment. For fans, watching the ball fly through the uprights is a “ho-hum” moment, rather than an “oh, wow!” occasion. The cheers for a field goal are polite, while the yawns are pervasive. It would be more surprising to Patriots fans to see Stephen Gostkowski miss a field goal than it would be to see Rob Gronkowski reading \"War and Peace.\" Gostkowski is 12-for-12 this season, 7-for-7 from 40 yards and beyond. He is Mr. Automatic. Mr. Perfect. Nobody’s perfect? A lot of NFL kickers are. The Bears’ Robbie Gould is 15-for-15, 7-for-7 from 40-plus, 3-for-3 from 50 and over. The Seahawks’ Steven Hauschka was 14-for-14, 7-for-7 from 40 and beyond, 4-for-4 from 50 and over going into Thursday night’s game in San Francisco. The Giants’ Josh Brown is 13-for-13. The Browns’ Travis Coons is 12-for-12, like Gostkowski. Denver’s Brandon McManus has booted a league-high 16 field goals in 17 attempts. He’s 4 of 5 from 50-plus. He’s probably embarrassed that he’s missed one. There are 12 kickers in the NFL with at least 10 field goals through the first six weeks of the season. Combined, they have made 148 of 160 attempts. That’s a conversion rate of 92.5 percent. Take out the Chiefs’ Cairo Santos and the Ravens’ Justin Tucker, who have missed three apiece, with four of those combined misses from beyond 50 yards, and the top guys are 123 of 129. It’s gotten to the point where it’s almost easier for an NFL kicker to make a 40-yard field goal than it is for a PGA Tour golfer to make a 4-foot putt. Page 2 of 2 - As for a 30-yarder, well, that’s like a slam dunk in basketball. Except that the dunks are more fun to watch. Oh, sure, once in a while, a ball will clang off the back rim, or one of the uprights. But, most of the time, you can score the points before the ball goes through. Now, I’m not trying to take the foot out of football. But I would like to see more suspense when the kicker comes out, instead of field-goal attempts being almost automatic. I would like to see coaches truly have to ponder whether to go for it on fourth down in an opponent’s territory, rather than simply sending out the field goal unit to put up the perfunctory three points. From a fan’s standpoint, what’s more exciting — watching a team try to pick up a first down on fourth-and-two at the opponent’s 30, or watching a kicker boot what has become a practically routine, 47-yard field goal through the uprights? Uprights which, hopefully, will be moved closer together for the 2016 season. —jdonalds@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:12:29.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
