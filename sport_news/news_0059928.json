It's been that way for two years and it will continue to be true in 2015. UMass (1-4, 1-1 MAC) fancied itself a contender for the Falcons' throne, but Saturday's lackluster performance in yet another blowout loss should wipe that pipe dream out of existence for good. In short, Bowling Green (4-2, 2-0) – with its high-powered offense, impressive non-conference performance and clear path to the MAC East title – is everything the Minutemen thought the could be in this make-or-break season. The year's not over yet, but the ship is sinking quickly. \nIt was over when: When UMass turned the ball over on downs in Bowling Green territory trailing 52-31with 13:41 left in the fourth quarter. The offense had done an ok job of responding to BG scores up until then, but that failed drive was the breaking point. \nMissed opportunities: Two other drives when the game was will in contention early will haunt UMass long after this week. The first was midway through opening quarter when, facing third and three from the Bowling Green 5-yard line, Blake Frohnapfel threw behind a wide-open Marken Michel at the goal line. Michel twisted and got two hands on the ball, but it dropped to the turf. UMass settled for the field goal and left four points on the table. Then, with 12 minutes left in the second quarter and UMass facing third and goal from the 8-yard line, Frohnapfel was again badly off the mark. Only this time, the ball was intercepted by Alfonso Mack, costing the Minutemen another seven points. BG promptly drove down the field for a touchdown, turning the Frohnapfel pick into a 14-point swing. From that point onward, the Falcons were rolling. \nDefense lays an egg: It's been the case for the better part of four years now – the UMass defense just isn't very good. After getting obliterated and allowing nearly 700 yards of offense Saturday, the Minutemen are now letting up over 40 points per game. Four-zero. BG quarterback Matt Johnson continued his amazing senior season, completing 33 of 29 passes for 450 yards and five touchdowns. His one interception was on a tipped ball. All-MAC wideout Roger Lewis was quiet until he wasn't, hauling in a 68-yard bomb to finish with 142 yards and a touchdown. UMass continues to look overmatched defensively, and it's hard to see an end in sight. \nHollow numbers: If you'd only been given a final box score from the game, you might think UMass had played pretty well. That's what a lot of big numbers will do. Frohnapfel threw for over 400 yards and three touchdowns. Tajae Sharpe and Rodney Mills both reach triple digits receiving. UMass scored over 30 points. That sounds like a recipe for success, but in reality, it was far from it. Again, UMass left points on the field, looked sloppy in execution and never really looked to be on the same playing field as its opponents. \nGreene goes again: Falcons running back Travis Greene will look back fondly on his career against UMass. In three games against the Minutemen, the lightning-quick senior rushed for 392 yards, including 122 Saturday. Greene is one of the shiftiest runners UMass has seen at the FBS level, and he was up to his usual tricks again this time, sliding through the line of scrimmage and getting up field for chunks of five and six yards before any defenders could get a lick on him. He averaged 8.1 yards per carry, highlighted by a long of 32 that saw Greene burst up the gut into the end zone all but untouched. He added another score on a 12-yard screen pass. UMass will be happy to see him graduate, that's for sure. \nInjury notes: Starting defensive tackle Sha-Ki Holines, who missed last week's game and was limited in practice all week, did not play. \nUMass game ball: Rodney Mills hadn't played in two weeks thanks to an ankle injury, but he looked like his usual self after the long layoff. He caught six balls for 100 yards in his comeback. \nUp next: The Minutemen return to New England for a pair of home games starting with Kent State next Saturday at McGuirk Stadium. UMass throttled Kent, 40-17, for the team's first win last year. The team could use another pick-me-up right now. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:15:37.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
