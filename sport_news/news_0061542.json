Terry 43-20 Thursday night.\nThat wouldn't typically mean much to anyone in San Antonio, let alone around the country, but this game had an air of wickedness about it â€” well, supposedly.\nA now deleted Twitter video alleged to capture Calhoun coach Richard Whitaker mysteriously slipping the official something via handshake.\nRyan Glasspiega l of The Big Lead reached Whitaker by phone Tuesday and the coach explicitly denied any wrongdoing.\nThe culprit, he says? A rogue poker chip.\nWhat the coach handed the official was a chip used by the Lamar Consolidated band to mark field position for band members during practice, according to Whitaker's account.\nTerry coach Tim Teykl had picked it up before the game, and given it to Whitaker for \"good luck.\"\n\"And so, after the game, again all in good humor, I reached out and handed the poker chip to the official,\" Whitaker told Glasspiegal. \"What you don't see on the video is when he passes by, he sees it's a cheap poker chip. He starts laughing, I start laughing, we point at each other, and I walked off.\"\nIt looks sketchy, but openly bribing an official immediately following a game, one in which your team won, is possibly one of the most witless moves anyone could make.\nAccording to the Houston Chronicle , Whitaker has had to answer questions from the University Interscholastic League, and the Calhoun County Independent School District has reached out to the official.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://thebiglead.com/2015/10/20/texas-high-school-football-bribe-video/", "http://blog.chron.com/sportsupdate/2015/10/port-lavaca-calhouns-coach-says-he-wasnt-bribing-official-instead-handing-over-bands-poker-chip/#photo-699535", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/32/8828591/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/32/8828591/4/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:24:07.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
