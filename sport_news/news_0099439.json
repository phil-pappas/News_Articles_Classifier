(AP) - A group of seven people is suing the city of Jackson, saying its municipal court illegally jailed them for their inability to pay court fines.\nThe federal lawsuit, spearheaded by two nonprofit legal groups, is another prong in a nationwide fight over how poor people should be treated by the criminal justice system.\nCliff Johnson, a lawyer for the men, says the city operates a system that is unconstitutionally harsh.\nThe city says it doesn't imprison anyone without legal authority.\nThe plaintiffs ask that the city be barred from sending people to jail without a lawyer and without checking defendants' ability to pay. They also want a ban on forcing people to work while in jail. The suit also asks that people who were jailed for unpaid fines be compensated.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
