Wow. Everything coming up Millhouse. 42-17.\n— Pete Thamel (@SIPeteThamel) October 16, 2015 Francis Owusu of @StanfordFball with the best football catch I&apos;ve ever seen in my life. No exaggeration. Absolutely destroying UCLA.\n— Mike Dudas (@mdudas) October 16, 2015 Francis Owusu caught a diving touchdown pass...reaching around his opponent&apos;s back. No doubt the play of the year.\n— Jacob Freedman (@Jacob_Freedman) October 16, 2015 Oh my god, Francis Owusu. That catch is out of this world. You&apos;ve made Chris Owusu irrelevant. You&apos;re king of the Owusus now.\n— Seattle Sportsnet (@alexSSN) October 16, 2015 Unbelievable catch by Francis Owusu. My goodness. TD, Stanford. The rout is on. #GoStanford\n— Donald King (@dbking65) October 16, 2015 Sports Center compared the take to that of Tyrone Prothro, who received an award for best play at the 2006 ESPY Awards after making a similar catch behind the head of a defender.\nThe former University of Alabama wide receiver caught the ball just short of his end zone, behind the head of Southern Mississippi’s Jasper Faulk just before half time. The play proved a pivotal in leading his side to victory.\nTyrone Prothro vs Francis Owusu. Who did it better? https://t.co/7TDITsAQsI\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) October 16, 2015 If Joe Tess remembers Tyrone Prothro 10 years later, then Francis Owusu just signed his name into CFB history. In ink. #UCLAvsSTAN\n— Ivan Maisel (@Ivan_Maisel) October 16, 2015 Francis Owusu joins Tyrone Prothro as the only college football players to EVER make that catch. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.\n— Walker Carey (@walkerRcarey) October 16, 2015 Francis Owusu with a tip of the cap to Tyrone Prothro.
