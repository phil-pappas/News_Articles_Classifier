It’s not doing any more damage by continuing to play.”\nCano, who hit just .254 in the first half, has been playing quite well in the second half of the season. Since July 1, he is hitting .331 with 50 runs scored, 15 doubles, 16 home runs and 52 RBIs. He’s closing the season with a 13-game hitting streak — currently the longest active in baseball — while hitting .365 during that span.\nOn Sept. 23 at Kansas City, he got his 2,000th hit, the 14th player in history — and first second baseman — to reach that milestone in his first 11 seasons.\nThe surgery will be performed by Philadelphia surgeon Dr. William Meyers and will require a six-week rehab period. It will be the first surgery in Cano’s big-league career.\n“He’ll be cleared to return to all baseball activities (after six weeks),” Khalfayan said.\nTypically, Cano said after the baseball season ends he takes four to six weeks to get completely away from baseball. So his timetable will not depart much from his usual offseason routine.\n“I can go to spring training and don’t have to worry about anything,” Cano said. “Everything is going to be normal, starting at the same time. I just got to be careful. I’m not supposed to lift anything heavy or anything like that.”\nCano is finishing the second year of a 10-year, $240 million contract.\nAsked why he doesn’t just take the final three games off, Cano said, “I love to play baseball. I played like this for the last two months. I love the game so much. I love to be out there.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under robinson cano ,  seattle mariners", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:06:44.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
