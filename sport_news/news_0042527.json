He torched one of the best secondaries in the NFL last Sunday and no reason he shouldn't put up good numbers against a suspect Buffalo secondary - especially at the safety positions - and the Bengals could have a tough time running the ball, too. \nLacy isn't off to a great fantasy start (51.4 yards per game and only one touchdown), but he's facing a Chargers defense that is allowing 132.4 yards per game rushing, which ranks 29th in the NFL. Murray got off to a horrible start, too, but he had 27 touches for 120 yards and a touchdown last week and that seems more in line what he can do each week. \nEdelman is a stat monster, averaging 8.5 catches for 99.8 yards per game and with three touchdown receptions in four games. Marshall has been consistently very good, too, averaging 7.5 receptions for 100.0 yards per game and with three touchdowns in four games as well. I went for some value with both Boldin and Brown. Boldin is facing a Baltimore pass defense that ranks 25th in the NFL, while Brown is averaging almost five receptions for 60 yards and is facing a pass defense ranked 20th. \nWith Buffalo's problems at safety I am hoping Eifert can have as big a game as he had in week one in Oakland and last week against Seattle. \nThe Vikings have a solid defense and are facing a Kansas City Chiefs offense that is now without Jamaal Charles and can't protect quarterback Alex Smith. \nBENGALS FANTASY VALUE \nEach week I rate the Bengals fantasy players value on the following system: touchdown means must play; field goal means it's a good play; first down means play only if you have to play him; punt means don't play at all: \nTouchdown (must play): WR A.J. Green (he is a must-play virtually every week); QB Andy Dalton (he's off to a great start, is averaging 303 yards and two touchdown passes per game and facing a defense that's tough to run against and average at best against the pass); TE Tyler Eifert (he is arguably a top five fantasy tight end). \nField Goal (good play): Defense/Special Teams (Bengals defense allowed significant yards the last three games, but is sacking QB, likely facing erratic E.J. Manuel and it feels like Adam Jones is about to bust a punt return for a TD). \nFirst Down (play only if you have to play him): RB Jeremy Hill (had three touchdowns against Kansas City and is top candidate around the goal line, but having a hard time getting untracked); RB Giovani Bernard (has been outstanding in his role the first five games, and is averaging 94 yards per game from scrimmage, but has just one TD); K Mike Nugent (he's coming off being named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week and is a candidate to be a solid producer each week because of the Bengals offense, although weather is a concern); WR Marvin Jones (bounced back from disappointing game against Kansas City to have five catches for 61 yards and last time he faced a Rex Ryan coached team he had four touchdown catches); WR Mohamed Sanu (had nine catches for 153 yards last two games after only five catches for 77 yards in first three games). \nPunt (don't play at all): Anyone else. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
