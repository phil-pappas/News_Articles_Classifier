Out of order comes chaos \nWe’re borrowing -- and reversing -- a noted philosophical phrase because that best describes what happened this past Friday, at least in two area regions. We thought we were getting a good handle on the shape of things in 8- and 7-AAA, and then Week 8 came along and made a complete mess of our notions. Region 7-AAA is now especially interesting after Fannin County knocked off Dawson County, while Banks County, Franklin County and East Hall all won to create, essentially, a five-way tie for first place in the league standings. Yes, Dawson and Franklin have a half-game lead, but with each of the five teams sporting just one region loss, it’s basically now a free-for-all in the race for the region crown. Things aren’t quite as chaotic in 8- -- Lanier is the clear front-runner there -- but Gainesville’s shocking defeat at Clarke Central combined with Flowery Branch’s continued resurgence and Winder-Barrow’s dogged determination means that there are now five teams within a game of each other in the race for the playoffs. Loganville is currently alone in second place, but the Red Elephants can still finish second if they win out . Yet the remaining scenarios are wildly varying, and should Gainesville slip again there are all sorts of options in play. The good thing is that we know that, eventually, out of all this chaos will come order. And the best part is that we get to watch it happen. \n2. Rabun County is for real \nComing into Friday’s showdown with No. 6 Union County, we thought that No. 7 Rabun County was a good team. After Friday’s 49-3 drubbing of the Panthers, we know that the Wildcats are a good team, perhaps historically so. Rabun displayed the kind of speed, power, balance, depth and ruthless determination that is a hallmark of all good programs en route to a 42-3 halftime lead. Outside of Union’s opening drive in which the Panthers were held to a field goal, Rabun’s swarming defense yielded just 59 yards. Meanwhile, sophomore quarterback Bailey Fisher showed an incredible ease and grasp of the Wildcats’ offense, accounting for four touchdowns and 346 total yards, spreading the ball around to eight different receivers -- a number of whom have the size and speed to terrorize any defense. Rabun also has two talented running backs in Cal Drummond and Eli Gipson. Granted the Wildcats put together perhaps their best overall performance of Lee Shaw’s time as Rabun head coach, but it is clear that this unit is capable of blowing past opponents even if the Wildcats are not as clinical as they were on Friday. It will be interesting to see how this group evolves in the coming weeks. \n3. North Hall’s playoffs begin this week \nWe have said before that this Trojans squad has a good chance at getting back into the playoffs this campaign. Well, essentially, North Hall’s postseason campaign starts this week. North Hall enters Week 9 alone in the fourth and final playoff spot in Region 8- and will play three teams currently sitting below them in the standings the next three Fridays. In other words, win and North Hall is back in the playoffs -- after a one-year absence. (In order for North Hall) Monroe Area, Chestatee and White County are each battling through tough campaigns, but there is no doubt that each is a tough out, and the Trojans will need to be at their best. And a loss would make things nip-and-tuck the rest of the way. But if North Hall can handle business, it will be right back where it feels it belongs. \n4. Cardiac Doggs are at it again \nLast season saw Winder-Barrow go 3-1 in games decided by one possession to charge back into the state playoffs for the first time in 11 years. This past Friday proved, once again, that the Bulldoggs’ penchant for dramatic victories is very much alive and well. Winder pulled off its second win of the season after trailing by two scores or more entering the fourth quarter by defeating Cedar Shoals 30-25 in Athens. It was also Winder’s third win of the campaign in games decided by one possession. The Bulldoggs’ fightbacks and refusal to quit have them right back in the thick of the postseason hunt in Region 8- . And while Winder faces two very tough back-to-back games in Clarke Central and Lanier, we wouldn’t want to bet against them doing what it takes -- whatever it takes and probably in the most dramatic manner possible -- to fight back into the postseason in 2015. \n5. Habersham, North Forsyth with chances to close strong \nIt has not been an easy season for the two sets of Raiders, but both have shown signs of improvement this season, and both also have a chance to close out 2015 on a strong note over the next three weeks. The two teams (a combined 1-13 so far but with a number of close losses) will face both each other, while Habersham will also tackle Chattahoochee (0-7) on the final week of the regular season. The Mt. Airy Raiders have certainly taken to coach Benji Harrison’s high-flying offense, averaging 23.1 points per game after averaging just 17.8 last season, and Habersham will hope to make hay with that group down the stretch. \nWEEK 8 HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL SCORES, Oct. 16 Athens Academy 44, Lakeview Academy 10 Banks County 48, Lumpkin County 31 Buford 51, Monroe Area 0 Centennial 42, Habersham Central 35 Clarke Central 44, Gainesville 7 Commerce 45, Providence Christian 0 East Hall 24, Johnson 14 Fannin County 31, Dawson County 15 Flowery Branch 41, Apalachee 6 Franklin County 21, West Hall 14 Hart County 41, Jackson County 24 Jefferson 49, East Jackson 0 Johns Creek 17, North Forsyth 14 North Hall 56, Madison County 28 North Oconee 20, White County 0 Oglethorpe County 21, Riverside Military 16 Prince Avenue Christian 42, Towns County 14 Rabun County 49, Union County 3 Stephens County 40, Chestatee 21 Winder-Barrow 30, Cedar Shoals 25 \nWEEK 9 HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL SCHEDULE, Oct. 23 Athens Christian at Lakeview Academy Banks County at Dawson County Cedar Shoals at Gainesville", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:46:35.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
