Feinstein featured coach Vince Kehres and his father, former coach Larry Kehres, in a column published online Wednesday.\nFeinstein is among the best-known sports columnists in the country. He has written 24 books, including the 1986 best seller A Season on the Brink about Bobby Knight. He also is a commentator for National Public Radio and the Golf Channel.\nWrites Feinstein: \"When Vince Kehres became head football coach at the University of Mount Union in 2013, the case could be made that he was stepping into coaching shoes that were impossible to fill.\nThe previous coach had decided to step down after winning his 11th Division III national title and his 21st consecutive Ohio Athletic Conference title. His overall record in 27 seasons at The Mount, as the school is called throughout northeast Ohio, was 332-24-3 — a winning percentage of .919, the highest in NCAA history.\n\" There was one more thing that made the job daunting: the coach Kehres succeeded was his father, Larry, who is now the school's athletic director.\n\"Larry Kehres's confidence in his son has been rewarded. In fact, as the Purple Raiders head into their game Saturday against Capital University, Vince Kehres's winning percentage is better than his father's. In his third season, he's 31-2 and this year's team is 3-0 and has outscored its opponents 164-0. That's not a typo.\n\"There is, however, a small but: the two losses have come in the national championship against the country's other D-III power, Wisconsin-Whitewater.' The Purple Raiders and the Warhawks have met one another in nine of the last 10 title games.''\nKehres' future: Feinstein notes Vince Kehres could have the opportunity to follow the path of Whitewater coach Lance Leipold, who after last season jumped to the University of Buffalo.\n\"I think I'm like my dad,\" Kehres told Feinstein. \"He was always comfortable here. I grew up here, my family's here and so is my wife's family. What I know for sure is I'm very happy with my job. I really enjoy getting up and going to work every day. I know there are jobs out there where, regardless of your record, that may not be true.\"\nNothing new: This, of course, is not news in Northeast Ohio. Mount Union is a fixture here year after year. The Purple Raiders waged a terrific battle with John Carroll last year for the Ohio Athletic Conference championship , and again in the NCAA Division III quarterfinals.\nMount Union's losses to Wisconsin-Whitewater in the 2013 Stagg Bowl and 2014 Stagg Bowl national championship games were particularly frustrating because the Purple Raiders had an uncharacteristic nine turnovers combined in the two games.\nMount Union last won a title in 2012, and three years feels like 50 in Purple Raider time.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/college-footballs-greatest-father-son-coaching-dynasty-is-at-mount-union/2015/09/30/33324492-677f-11e5-8325-a42b5a459b1e_story.html", "http://athletics.mountunion.edu/sports/fball/index"], "published": "2015-10-01T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:53:46.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
