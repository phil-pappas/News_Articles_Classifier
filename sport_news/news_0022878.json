Only his body language agreed with what others were thinking: How could you not use your No. 1 goalie in the first game at Canadian Tire Centre of the season, especially when it was against the division rival Montreal Canadiens?\nWhat Anderson actually said sounded a lot like the words that came from Blue Jays knuckleballer R.A. Dickey after he was pulled when going good in Game 4 of the American League Division Series.\n“I had no part of the decision,” said Anderson, who is out of the gate with a 2-0 start and has played countless back-to-back games in his career. “I’m the player, and my job is to be ready to play, when I’m told to play. I’m not the guy ... as a player you don’t dictate when or how you play. It’s coach’s decision.”\nBut disappointing not to be a part of the home opener nonetheless?\n“I was still part of it. I was still getting out there ... getting the double wave going,” cracked Anderson. “I think it was just kind of the nature of the schedule, and coach’s decision. I was there to support my teammates, and make sure I could do everything I could to help the team win, in the situation I was in.”\nThe return of Hammond from the first groin injury of his career has, as expected, resulted in Matt O’Connor’s demotion to Binghamton. Like everyone else, Anderson praised O’Connor for his debut performance, which saw the rookie allow a soft first period goal but winding up with 31 saves.\nCameron, who said O’Connor “was not the issue” in the 3-1 loss, is now demanding better back zone play from his team.\n“More aggressive defensively in our own end, is the biggest thing we have to do,” said Cameron. “We’re too passive in our own end.”\nHammond was supposed to be out for two weeks, so he’s beating that timeline by a couple of days. After “four or five” on-ice workouts, he finally practised with his teammates Tuesday.\n“I feel ready,” said Hammond, who has a 20-1-2 regular season record as a starter in the NHL. “I feel comfortable. (There’s) nothing (in the way of lingering pain). That was part of the deal ... if there’s anything at all, to shut it down, because that’s really how these things kind of become something that will carry on throughout the season.\n“If it would have been last year, the end of the season and the playoffs or something, I don’t think I would have taken any time off. But it was something that was only going to get worse, so it’s just something you’ve got to kind of nip in the bud now.”\nThe Senators will bring a 13-0-3 road record (dating back to last season) into a battle with a Blue Jackets team that has had trouble getting untracked this season.\nTheir 0-3-0 mark is comprised of a home-opening 4-2 loss to the New York Rangers, a 5-2 defeat at the hands of those same Blueshirts at Madison Square Garden, and a 4-2 fumble in Buffalo.\nWith high expectations placed on them this season, Columbus players used the words “disappointing” and “unacceptable” regarding the loss to the rebuilding Sabres, while coach Todd Richards said it was “concerning.”\nAs a result, the Senators will be treading into dangerous waters.\n“They’ll be pressing,” said winger Clarke MacArthur. “They’re going to do a little extra to get that first win. Anytime you get 0-3, even though it’s early, they’re going to be making plays, pushing and trying to get something done early.\n“We’ve got to be aware of that early on. It’s a tough building to play in. We’ve got to be ready for them.”\nTwitter: @sundonib\nHammond back with Senators, ahead of schedule\nBy Don Brennan , Ottawa Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 12:20 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 08:11 PM EDT\nThe Senators did some goalie shuffling before heading off to Columbus Tuesday afternoon.\nAndrew Hammond was declared good to return from a groin injury that had sidelined him for the start of the season, meaning rookie Matt O’Connor was sent to the AHL affiliate in Binghamton.\nCraig Anderson is expected to get the start Wednesday, when the 2-1-0 Senators take on the Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena.\nHammond, who led Ottawa to the playoffs last spring, said he’s been skating by himself for the last four or five days.\nAbout the author Don Brennan Don Brennan's Blog Follow Don Brennan on Twitter Other Stories Ottawa Senators seem to relish time on the road\nAs much as they enjoyed being home for Thanksgiving dinner, there's no place like the road for the Ottawa Senators.\n0\nSens winger MacArthur insists 'he's fine' and ready to go\nInsisting he does not have another concussion, Clarke MacArthur was his old self Tuesday -- he practiced with the rest of the Senators, then laughed off concerns over the head injury he sustained in Saturday's final exhibition game against the Habs.\n0\nSee more from Don Brennan »\n Hockey Babcock\n'Personal reasons'?
