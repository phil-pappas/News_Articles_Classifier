According to a Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office press release, a man reported he won $9,000 Thursday afternoon at Chicken Ranch Casino. While driving to his Groveland-area home, the man said a brown Chevrolet pickup truck passed him on Highway 49. Shortly after, the same truck was parked on the side of the highway with its hood up, the press release stated. A female adult standing next to the vehicle flagged the man down. When the man pulled over to assist, a male, who the man did not see at first, held him at gunpoint and demanded the money. The man denied having any money, the press release stated, but the male suspect knew he had won at the casino and continued demanding the money. The man then gave the male suspect the money and both suspects got into the pickup truck and drove southbound on Highway 49. This incident is under investigation. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Sheriff’s Office at 533-5815.
