It has been, by all accounts, a good year for FIFA.\nOr, to be more specific, it has been a very bad year for the power structure at FIFA, and as a result a very good year for everyone else.\nAdChoices After nearly two decades, FIFA president Sepp Blatter’s stranglehold on the organization has been loosened. In June, in response to an on-going corruption scandal and FBI investigation, Blatter announced he would be resigning as president.\nAnd last Thursday , Blatter, along with UEFA president Michel Platini and FIFA secretary general Jérôme Valcke, was suspended for 90 days from all football-related activities. This news is of course very encouraging for anyone with the interests of the global game in mind.\nBut if the suspensions represent a positive step for FIFA, the reaction to them from FIFA's member nations also indicates how far the organization still has to go to really clean up its act. In other, more depressing words, FIFA is still a profoundly corrupt organization, and it is beginning to feel as though no amount of suspensions or arrests or elections is going to change that fact.\nIn particular, the reaction to Platini’s involvement in this latest turn of events has been troubling. Until Thursday, Platini had been the favorite to win FIFA's upcoming presidential election (scheduled for February of next year). Then came the suspension; FIFA’s ethics committee announced it was investigating a payment (of $2.07m) Platini received from Blatter in 2011, shortly before Blatter was reelected for his fourth term as FIFA president and…nothing seemed to change.\nThe French Football Federation, unsurprisingly, was the first to back Platini, promising to support him in the upcoming elections regardless of the findings of the ethics committee. CONMEBOL, the South American Football Confederation, quickly followed suit, while the rest of the world has been suspiciously non-committal throughout the whole affair.\nThe English FA, for example, has taken a wait-and-see approach to the allegations. If the ethics committee finds Platini guilty, the English FA will retract its support; if the ethics committee finds him innocent, it will continue to back the Frenchman.\nOn the face of it, this sounds like a perfectly reasonable approach; it would seem unfair to retract support for Platini if he has done nothing wrong. The problem with this approach is that it ignores the question of why anyone with the best interests of FIFA in mind would support Platini in the first place.\nIndeed, whether Platini turns out to be innocent or not is almost beside the point here. This is a man, after all, who, in an attempt to defend himself, freely admitted to working as a special adviser to Sepp Blatter, who is currently being hounded out of FIFA as its most corrupt president since, well, the previous one, João Havelange .\nAnd this is perhaps the real measure of FIFA’s exquisite ridiculousness. As far as FIFA presidents go, Blatter might not even be that bad . For all his comic-book villainy, for all the corruption and the lies, he has also made some genuinely positive contributions to the global game, taking the world cup to Africa and East Asia for the first time, and generally bringing an end to the Euro-South American power axis that has held sway over the game for most of its history.\nThis being the case, the recent indictments and FBI investigation are nothing if not an opportunity. An opportunity, finally, for FIFA to make a clean break from its past. And if Blatter ends up taking an unfair share of the blame for the many fundamental structural problems at FIFA, it might not be such a terrible price to pay.\nIf this year has taught us anything, it must surely be that the standard for what is deemed acceptable behavior for FIFA officials can no longer be the same standard as that of the courts. That is, what FIFA needs now is not simply innocent representatives, legally speaking, but representatives who can legitimately claim no involvement in the corruption that has plagued FIFA throughout its history.\nAnd so not only would a Platini-led FIFA fail–in the most spectacular way to do this–it would also represent a step back into those Euro-centric dark ages in which the idea of an African World Cup was about as ludicrous as the idea of a winter World Cup (wait, what?).\nWhat FIFA needs now is to wash its hands of the Blatter regime and everyone who was involved in it. Admittedly, this sort of wholesale overhaul is going to take a long time, and it would be foolish to think FIFA can clean up its act entirely in only one election cycle.\nBut it is not unreasonable to hope that FIFA’s members—particularly those UEFA nations, like England, who would most obviously benefit from a European president—might find the courage to look elsewhere, to someone outside the current establishment, to someone who may not represent their country’s best interests in the short term, but who might actually be capable of getting FIFA on the right track in the long term.\nThere is currently no obvious candidate who fits this mold. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, who lost to Blatter in the presidential election held earlier this year, is probably the most obvious choice. He is not a total outsider, but he has very little connection to Blatter or any of the other FIFA officials embroiled in the recent corruption scandal, and he has a stated commitment to improving the profile of FIFAs lesser nations.\nFormer Real Madrid midfielder, Luis Figo, is another option. Figo withdrew from this year’s presidential race, complaining that “this process is anything but an election. This process is a plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man—something I refuse to go along with.” So he certainly has the anti-Blatter box ticked and his exploits as a player will surely endear him to most fans outside of Barcelona. He is inexperienced, and probably lacks some political acumen, but FIFA could benefit from fewer politicians among its ranks and a few more people who really love the game. Then again, Platini was a great player too.\nThe fact is that there are no easy solutions here. Prince Ali is not perfect. Figo is not perfect. And no left-field candidate that might emerge in the coming months will be perfect either.\nStill, electing someone like Prince Ali or Figo would be a huge step for FIFA—an acknowledgement of the need for real change. A lot of serious structural problems will remain, and they will not be solved overnight. But electing a president in this mold will at least send a message, a message someone like Platini simply can’t deliver.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/08/sepp-blatter-suspended-fifa", "http://thesportsquotient.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.ibtimes.com/fifa-under-former-president-joao-havelange-was-involved-corruption-long-sepp-blatters-1941099", "http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32826308"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:59:14.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
