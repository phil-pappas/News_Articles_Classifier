The Green Raiders’ success on the pitch comes directly from their belief in sharing the wealth in all phases of the game. \nReceiving contributions from many sources, Ramapo is off to a 9-1 start, has outscored the opposition, 33-9, and has posted seven shutouts. The Raiders defeated Mahwah, 5-0, in the Bergen County tournament last weekend to advance to the quarterfinals Sunday morning against Don Bosco. \n\"We’re just trying to play good, solid all-around soccer,\" Ramapo coach Evan Baumgarten said. \"If we work as hard as we can, in the end, the results should be there. The pieces to the puzzle have really fit together well so far this year. We’ve maintained a high level of play, and we’re just looking to improve and build on that success as the year goes on.\" \nBaumgarten has constructed a dynasty at the Franklin Lakes school, with eight Bergen championships – the most of any coach – in his 30-season tenure. He also presided over consecutive Group 3 state championship teams in 2011 (outright) and 2012 (shared with Princeton), and Ramapo has claimed six overall state Group championships. \nThe current Raiders boast plenty of firepower, including senior center/midfielder Dylan Rocchio (four goals, seven assists), an All-North Jersey selection who is a scorer and distributor. Also helping Ramapo’s offense have been senior striker Charlie Ortiz (six goals, four assists), senior left midfielder Justin Chi (five goals, one assist) and sophomore center/midfielder Sebastian Varela (seven goals, three assists). \nAiding Ramapo’s deep lineup has been junior wing Jonathan Kim and sophomore forward Andrew Furman. Senior goaltender Colin Nelson, assisted by junior Conor Young, has done first-rate work in the net. \nRamapo’s one loss this season was to NV/Old Tappan, 5-2. The Green Raiders are battling Northern Highlands and Ridgewood for the Big North Freedom Division title. Ramapo has defeated Ridgewood, 4-3, in double overtime. \nThe Raiders have won two of the past three Bergen County championships. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:33:17.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
