He allowed one run in 111/3 innings over those two outings, with his final start coming Oct. 2. \n“He’s got really good numbers against these guys,” Yost said. “They’re both great choices, but, you know, Chris Young, his last two starts of the year were really, really good for us. We feel like he gives us a good chance to win.” \nThe 6-foot-10, third-round draft pick out of Princeton in 2000 appeared as a reliever in Game 1 of the ALDS, giving up a run in four innings. Overall, he was 11-6 in 34 appearances — 18 starts — this year. \nYoung faced the Blue Jays once this year, a 7-5 loss July 11. Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run shot and Young yielded five hits and three runs over six innings. But over his 11-year career, Young has held current members of the Blue Jays to a .229 average (22-for-96) with two homers. \nMedlen was 6-2 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 appearances, including eight starts, this year. He returned from Tommy John surgery July 20 and hasn’t pitched since Oct. 1. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:30:52.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
