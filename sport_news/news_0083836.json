I am thrilled to see everyone play their part and put these wins and rallies together as a team.” Noelani Helm scored 10 kills for the Blue Devils (2-9 record) along with her two serving aces, 25 digs and a block. Teammate Tara Krivoshein tallied a kill, an ace, 28 assists, 15 digs and two blocks, while Faith Hoe notched 10 kills, an ace and five digs. Wa-Hi’s Emma Wenzel chipped in another six kills and two blocks, Emily Hedine had four kills and 18 digs, and Karli Plucker made six digs and two aces. Emily Dimino helped the Blue Devils with seven digs and two aces, while Whitney Enriquez had seven digs and a kill. “Our biggest threat last night was our offense,” McDaniels said. “Our hitters found a way to get it done, and allow Kennewick to make the errors. We had the best offensive numbers all season.” The Blue Devils next play Thursday at Southridge. “We’ll need to maintain that (offense) and grow on our defense,” McDaniels said. “We have three regular season matches left, and I have high expectations for this group.” Pioneers rally late, but fall to La Grande MILTON-FREEWATER — McLoughlin High School’s volleyball team settled down from a forgettable first half to the match against La Grande, but the Pioneers were already well behind, and although they challenged the first-place Tigers in the final set, they wound up losing all three, 25-3, 25-13 and 25-23. “We had a rough start tonight, but finally found our groove and really played our game in the end,” Pioneers coach Amanda Nelson said. Brooke Smiley scored six kills and made a dig for Mac-Hi (0-5 in the Greater Oregon League), while Brittany Erb tallied five kills and a block, and Shannon Carter added 23 digs and a kill. The Pioneers next play Thursday at Baker. Thomas leads Irish over Prescott PRESCOTT — DeSales’ Maddy Thomas led DeSales, scoring six kills and serving six aces, as the Irish won all three sets at Prescott, 25-14, 25-18 and 25-10, in a Southeast 2B League match Tuesday. “Our entire team had a great night of serving; however, every time Maddy was behind the line she was able to get us a run of a minimum of three points, with her longest run giving us six points and a nice lead in the third match,” DeSales volleyball coach Ann Murray said. The Irish improved their record in the league to 4-3, with their overall mark evening at 8-8. Senior libero Teresa Acock helped the Irish offense with 20 digs, while senior Allesyn Lyons set 11 assists. “We gave a few error points and started slow by earning our points the wrong way, getting our side-outs from the Tigers’ errors,” Murray said. “However, we were able to come back and finally set up our strong offense and began playing smart and placing the ball well. “We also changed our entire rotation for this game from a 6-2 to 5-1 and the girls were able to adapt extremely well to the transitioning.” Meanwhile, Prescott (1-8 overall, 0-8 in the league) started and ended slow, but played its style of ball in the second set. The Tigers scored most of their points defensively. Prescott senior Athziry Amezcua made six digs, while junior back row players Maribel Mendoza and Elizabeth Perez each tallied three. “We certainly looked like the Lady Tigers that we are in the second set, but we need to string together that effort throughout an entire match. That’s the goal,” Prescott coach Bob Young said. DeSales next play Thursday at Dayton. Prescott next plays its alumni Friday at 5 p.m. in the first annual Alumni Homecoming Match. “We’re looking forward to a fun evening on Friday against the alumni,” Young said. “It’s another step in creating a volleyball culture at Prescott. We want to invite the locals out to watch former players from the 80s, 90s and 2000s.” Bulldogs overcome illness, sweep Asotin ASOTIN — Dayton coach Shannon Turner kept three of her varsity regulars on the bench for the first two sets here Tuesday in a 27-25, 25-11, 25-19 Southeast 2B League volleyball sweep of Asotin. “We had three players who were sick the night before so I decided not to play them in the first two games,” Turner said. “Instead I suited up four junior varsity players, and they all got in and played well.” Starting setter Hanna Becker, top server Megan Robins and all-around reserve Scully Castorena were the three Bulldogs held out of the first two sets because of their illness. All three did see action in the third set. “This allowed me to put Mia Becker in the starting setter position, and I was also able to move some other players around in the first two games,” Turner said. “It was an opportunity to do some different things, mix things up and watch them have to work through it.” Becker responded with an all-around game, going 15-for-15 from the service line, putting up five assists and registering six digs. Kaleigh White was the team’s serving leader at 17-for-17, Tatumn Laughery led the Bulldogs with 10 digs and Josilyn Fullerton put up a team-best 11 assists. Fullerton and Jenna Phillips led the way at the net with seven kills each. Dayton improved to 6-2 in league play and 8-3 overall. The Bulldogs host DeSales Thursday in another league match, with rematches against Walla Walla Valley Academy and Tri-Cities Prep, the league leaders, still to come. “WWVA hasn’t lost and Tri-Cities Prep has lost just once,” Turner said. “We lost to both of them, but we have them coming around again. So we have the opportunity to split with them.” Pirates take care of Garfield-Palouse PALOUSE — No. 1-ranked Pomeroy moved a step closer to the Southeast 1B League volleyball championship here Tuesday with a 25-21, 25-16, 25-16 victory over Garfield-Palouse. The defending Class 1B state champs raised their league record to 10-0, and they’re 17-3 overall with four league matches remaining. But Pomeroy coach Jim Greene wasn’t ready to anoint his team league champs just yet. “This was one of those matches where you don’t save the video tape,” Greene said of Tuesday’s straight-set victory. “In fact, this video has already been destroyed. “It was one of those matches where neither team ever got untracked. There were a lot of unforced errors the entire match.” Esther Schuh led the Pirates at the net with six kills, Ireland Mayfield posted a team-best nine assists and Bryeana Myrick produced six stuff blocks. “The bulk of it was serving,” Greene said of his team’s ability to overpower the Vikings. “Sydney Smith was 13-for-13 with three aces and Kacey Halbert was 16-for-17 with three aces.” Halbert also put up four digs to lead the Pirates. Next up for Pomeroy is its homecoming match Thursday against St. John-Endicott. Varsity start time has been set for 6:15 p.m. The Pirates travel to Lacrosse next Tuesday and close out league play with home matches against Oakesdale Oct. 22 and Colton Oct. 27. Oakesdale and Colton have lost two league matches each, splitting against each other in addition to home-court losses to the Pirates. “At this point we are sitting good,” Greene said. “I wish I could relax, but I can’t.” Touchet improves, but suffers another loss TOUCHET — Touchet stepped up to compete with Oakesdale only five days after struggling against Pomeroy, but the Indians suffered another loss, 25-16, 25-22 and 25-20, in a Southeast 1B match Tuesday at home. “The girls played much better tonight,” Touchet volleyball coach April Miller said. “We still need to focus and get our serving percentage up, get all our blocks and set ourselves up for offense better, but (this was) night-and-day from our last game. The girls are engaged and working hard.” Rachel Miller scored 10 kills and cleared all 13 of her serve attempts, including two aces for Touchet (4-6 overall, 3-6 in the league). She also made 12 digs. The Indians’ Cierra Jo McKeown tallied seven kills, 13 assists and teamed with Dana Jaggar to make a block. Abby Grudzinski added another block, and Jennifer Aceves was good on all eight of her serves along with nine digs. Meanwhile, Oakesdale’s Maddy Shrope had 30 assists, Jacey Johnson scored 15 kills and Corinne Anderson made 13 digs. Touchet next plays Thursday at Kahlotus. Stellar serving helps Helix past Ione HELIX — Ninety-three percent serving as a team helped carry Helix to a 25-8, 25-21, 25-23 victory over Ione here Tuesday in a non-league prep volleyball match. Lynne Ashby was 19-for-19 from the service line and Paden Flerchinger and Charmayne Bennett were 13-for-13 each. Flerchinger and Bennett were each credited with two serving aces. Flerchinger also led the Grizzlies at the net with 12 kills. Saide Wilson and Kailey Mize followed with 12 and 8 kills, respectively. “We came out really strong and played well in the first set,” Helix coach Tammie Parker said. “I thought we backed off a little bit with our passing in the second and third sets. We weren’t as accurate as we can me. “But we worked hard and came out with the win. I’m just excited about playing this weekend.” The Grizzlies host Echo in an Old Oregon League match Thursday and travel to North Powder to take on Powder Valley Saturday to finish up the league season. The Grizzlies, at 9-1, league the league while Powder Valley is in second place with two losses and Echo is in third with a three defeats. Joseph, which is responsible for Helix’s only league defeat, is in fourth place. “We defeated Echo in three sets and Powder Valley in five the first time we played them,” Parker said. “We just need to show up and play our style of volleyball, which is good passing. “If we can get our passes where they need to be, we can run our offense. We like to run a little quicker game, and we need to set the pace.” The Grizzlies are 16-3 overall.
