The Highlanders went through some growing pains early in the season with their losses at Ramsey and Lakeland, but those losses have turned into lessons for the team. That early stretch featured a lot of unfamiliar playing surfaces, possibly an intangible edge for Highlands. \nGabby Pontone’s 27 goals and 12 assists lead Northern Highlands, backed up by Chelsea Quinn (seven goals), Katie Bors (six goals) and Jennifer Asnis (six goals). Asnis also has 10 assists. Starting goalie Victoria Marino returned from a concussion in the win against Kittatinny and leads the team with 50 saves. \nThe statistics for Ramsey (18-0) have been slightly gaudier this season: 84 goals scored, five goals allowed. The last goal allowed was in an Oct. 1 contest against Demarest. This team has no weaknesses. The two teams are comparable in terms of defense, but attacking is a different story. The Rams have a 12-goal scorer, Olivia Doherty, and a 10-goal scorer, Lia DiPiazza, to back up North Jersey leading scorer Kassidy Shetler (31 goals, 20 assists). They also have great facilitators in Rebecca Moya (11 assists) and Mary Pless (10 assists). \n— Dave Meisel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:04:10.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
