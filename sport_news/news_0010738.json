Three winners from his first serve. That was really amazing.\" \nDefending champion Federer tamely succumbed to 70th-ranked Albert Ramos-Vinolas on Tuesday but Nadal's win means the other big names march on at Shanghai's Qi Zhong Stadium. \nTop-ranked Djokovic, fresh from his sixth China Open victory in Beijing, breezed past Martin Klizan 6-2, 6-1 as he seeks his ninth title of a year in which he won three of the four Grand Slams. \n\"Considering the fact that I've won so many matches this year and tournaments, probably the best season of my life definitely, anywhere I go I'm confident,\" said the Serb, who moves to 69-5 this season. \nMurray, another two-time winner in Shanghai, zipped past Steve Johnson 6-2, 6-4, and French Open champion Stan Wawrinka beat Viktor Troicki 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:09:41.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
