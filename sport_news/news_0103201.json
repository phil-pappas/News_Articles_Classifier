The big uglies, they're amazing.'' \nQuarterback Jacky Luevasa had a career game, completing 15 of 20 passes for 313 yards and five touchdowns. Super-quick running back Raymone Sanders carried 13 times for 187 yards and three touchdowns. Speedy wide receiver Aidan Verba-Hamilton scored four touchdowns.. The Crusaders had 576 yards of total offense and even ran a flea-flicker twice -- getting a touchdown on each occasion, \nNine touchdowns were scored in the first quarter, five by Riordan, four by Serra. The Crusaders led 32-29 at the end of the quarter and 46-35 at halftime. \nSerra (2-3, 0-2) landed the first punch, taking the opening possession and going 79 yards in five plays for a touchdown. Quarterback Sitaleki Nunn dropped back to pass, was under pressure and took off running, not stopping until he was in the end zone after a 45-yard TD run. A shovel pass to Brandon Monroe made it 8-0 Serra.

But, somehow, Riordan scored two touchdowns to take the lead before the quarter ended -- Jamarian Caston on a 74-yard kickoff return and then on the last play of the quarter it was Luavasa to Verba-Hamilton on a 42-yard touichdown pass on a flea flicker. \n\"That was fun,'' Luevasa said. \nRiordan added two more touchdowns in the five minutes of the second quarter to extend its lead to 46-29 after a 3-yard fumble return by Rocco Russell. That was one of five fumbles lost by Serra. \n\"We need to go back and clean those up,'' Serra offensive coordinator Steven Lo said. Nunn carried 16 times for 128 yards and Lataimua 18 times for 126 yards for Serra, which had 480 yards of total offense. Monroe caught nine passes for 164 yards. \n\"It's a wacky league this year,'' Serra coach Patrick Walsh said. \"We did a lot of good things today, the effort was there. Unfortunately I didn't have the team in the frame of mind to execute. That's my fault.''
