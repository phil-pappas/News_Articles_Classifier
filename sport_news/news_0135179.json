Williams , Stevens Point Journal Media 11:17 p.m. CDT October 16, 2015 Tennis CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMADISON — It's not supposed to look this easy, but Emily Luetschwager is certainly giving that impression. \nThe Stevens Point Area Senior High junior and No. 1 seed at the WIAA Division 1 state tournament continues to easily dispatch any singles player standing on the other side of the net from her. \nLuetschwager took two more steps in her bid to capture the school's first state tennis championship with a pair of straight-set wins Friday at Nielsen Tennis Stadium to advance to the state semifinals. \nNext up for Luetschwager is a matchup with fifth-seeded Katya Mikhailenko of Homestead, who upset fourth-seeded teammate Anna Kreynin 6-2, 6-1 in the quarterfinals, at 9 a.m. Saturday. \n\"(Emily) played two very good players today and was very decisive in her wins,\" SPASH coach Gary Baier said. \"Tomorrow will be a challenge as each round seems to notch up the competition. But she can do it. She's confident and very skilled.\" \nYet to lose a set all season, Luetschwager made sure that didn't happen in her third round match against Emily Behling of Kettle Moraine. The SPASH standout cruised to a 6-1, 6-2 win to reach the quarterfinals. \nNicolet's Alice Pascuzzi, the No. 8 seed, tried her luck against the top seed and met the same fate. Luetschwager continued her dominance by dismantling Pascuzzi 6-0, 6-2 to keep her state title dream very much alive. \n\"Emily is playing great. She is solid on her ground strokes and is serving well,\" Baier said. \"If she can continue to play her game, which I believe she will, she will be hard to beat.\" \nSPASH brought a full contingent of six players to Madison, and Luetschwager is the only one left standing after the No. 1 doubles team of Juliet Champion and Jaide Barber lost in the round of 32. \nBarber and Champion battled through a tough super-tiebreaker in the opening match just to reach the second round, but ran into No. 4 seed Elise Gerard and Annabelle Crowley and found out why the Nicolet pairing was so highly seeded. \nCrowley and Gerard ended the season for the three-time state qualifiers in convincing fashion, rolling to a 6-2, 6-0 victory. Champion and Barber concluded their season with a 22-8 record. \n\"(Jaide and Juliet) played much better today than they did yesterday. Nicolet was just a better team,\" Baier said. \"We tried a few different tactics, but the Nicolet girls were very experienced and talented.\" \nNewman Catholic sophomore Laura Larrain enjoyed mixed results in Division 2 during Friday. \nLarrain, the No. 7 seed, opened the day in impressive fashion, steamrolling Meredith Heckert of Big Foot/Williams Bay 6-3, 6-0 to earn a spot in the state quarterfinals. \nHer day ended on a sour note, however, when second-seeded Kenosha St. Joseph Catholic Academy junior Claire Czerwonka handed Larrain a 6-1, 6-4 loss. Despite the loss, she still has a chance to place fifth. \nLarrain will meet Rachel Anderson of Racine Saint Catherine’s in a consolation match at 8:30 a.m. Saturday. If she beats Anderson, Larrain will face either Olivia Czerwonka or Hannah Alme of Baldwin-Woodville in the fifth-place match. \nScott A.
