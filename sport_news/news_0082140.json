The teams meet again in Week 17.\nNeither team looked sharp in front of a prime-time audience. They combined for seven turnovers and 21 penalties.\nThe Giants gave the Eagles first downs on a roughing-the-passer penalty and a running-into-the-kicker penalty to keep both of their TD drives going.\nManning completed his first 10 passes, including a 13-yard TD pass to Odell Beckham Jr. for a 7-0 lead.\nBut things went downhill for Manning from there.\nThe Eagles took a 14-7 lead in the second quarter when Carroll jumped in front of a pass intended for Dwayne Harris and ran it back untouched for his first career TD.\nAfter Nikita Whitlock ran into punter Donnie Jones to give Philadelphia a first down at its 28, Murray took over. He had two runs of 11 yards each and finished off the drive with a 12-yard TD run to give Philadelphia a 24-7 lead in the third quarter.\nMurray had his best game since joining the Eagles after a record-breaking season in Dallas. The All-Pro led the NFL in rushing last year and broke Emmitt Smith 's single-season club record, but has struggled in Philadelphia. He entered the game with 130 yards this season.\nThe Eagles were 1-3 before a 39-17 win over the New Orleans Saints at home last week. They'll travel to play unbeaten Carolina (5-0) next Sunday night.\nThe Giants had won three in a row. They'll play host to Dallas (2-3) next week.\nBradford had a pair of third-quarter interceptions on poor throws, including one that Landon Collins picked in the end zone.\nBut Philadelphia's defense bailed him out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:10:59.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
