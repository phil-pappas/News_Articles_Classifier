Michigan State special teams coach Mark Snyder stopped a couple syllables shy of saying as much this week. \nThe Spartans are dealing with a special teams crisis while they celebrate arguably the greatest special teams moment in program history. \nTheir kicker lacks confidence. And they lack confidence in their punter. Their coverage units are statistically abysmal, their return game statistically impotent. \nHere are the grim numbers. \nMSU ranks 122 out of 127 FBS teams in punt return defense, allowing 16.1 yards per return, and is 119th in net punting at 33 yards a boot. Meanwhile the Spartans’ own punt return average ranks next to last in the country at less than 2 yards an attempt. \nTheir kick return defense is 86th, allowing 22-plus yards a return. Their own kick return is 78th at less than 21. \nKicker Michael Geiger is 5 for 9 on field goals, with two blocked and one made off the upright, his accuracy 100th out of 110 kickers with enough tries to be measured. \nThe Spartans’ field goal unit is in a 10-way tie for 116th out of 127 with three blocks allowed, including an extra point. \nAnd, overall, the Spartans rank 124th in special teams efficiency. Michigan, by comparison, is No. 1 — all but negating this column. \nMichigan's Jabrill Peppers returns a punt as defensive back Dymonte Thomas (25) puts a ferocious block on Michigan State safety Khari Willis in the second quarter Saturday in Ann Arbor.

MSU’s own return game, for example, isn’t a debilitating problem, even if it isn’t dynamic. And MSU’s kickoff coverage was worse during its Rose Bowl season in 2013. \nThe rest of it, though, will add up to a defeat if it isn’t corrected. It nearly did each of the last two weeks. Couch: R.J. Shelton's emergence saves MSU's season \nGeiger’s issues aren’t new. The punting troubles, however, rose to the forefront when redshirt freshman Jake Hartbarger was replaced for most of the Michigan game by backup quarterback Tyler O’Connor. \nHartbarger struggled to hang on to Taybor Pepper’s longsnaps against Purdue and at Rutgers. The latter, in his defense, bounced off the turf before reaching him. The Purdue drop was less explainable. \n“That was punt-safe (protection). I would hope (it wouldn’t have a lasting effect),” MSU special teams coach Mark Snyder said, sounding unsympathetic. “There were four guys coming (at him). Anyway, but those things stick in the back of your head sometimes. You get in an environment like the Michigan game, 111,000 people …” \nEnter O’Connor. \nMichigan State backup quarterback Tyler O'Connor punts the ball to Michigan's Jabrill Peppers (not pictured) during the second half Saturday at Michigan Statdium.

(Photo: Mike Carter / USA TODAY Sports) \n“Tyler’s got moxie, he’s a footba…, he’s a quarterback,” Snyder said. “That don’t bother him. We could go practice and I could send 20 (players) at him, it’s not going to bother him.” \nThe pressure may not have impacted O’Connor, but the fact that he’s not actually a punter, did. He punted four times Saturday — for 26, 46, 41 and 40 yards. The real problem was the trajectory and the net gain. \nO’Connor’s punt yardage should really read: 26, 48, 7 and 20. That’s taking into account a 34-return set up by low hang-time and a touchback on a punt 40 yards from the end zone. \n“I think it starts with our specialists — they’ve got to perform better,” Snyder said. “Our coverage units have not been bad. We’ve just put them in bad situations, punting the ball to a really good returner, 2.5 (seconds) hanging, you can’t survive like that.” \nFormer MSU All-American punter Mike Sadler agrees. \n“The coverage units certainly are struggling, but I don’t think it’s their faults,” Sadler said. \n“They all prepare during the week under the assumption they’re going to get good kicks. As soon as you have kicks that are incredibly low or on the wrong side of the field, people struggle to get in their coverage lanes. That applies to both punting and kickoffs. We’ve struggled kicking the ball in both those areas.” \nIf not for Michigan’s own dropped snap in the final seconds, the decision to punt with O’Connor would be primarily to blame for MSU’s loss in Ann Arbor. \nThere is no choice now but to ride Hartbarger. He’s actually a punter — and, potentially, a pretty good one. MSU FB Pendleton has knack for big plays, big hits \n“Jake Hartbarger has unbelievable ability, unbelievable ability,” coach Mark Dantonio said. “He reminds me of Tommy Tupa, who was at Ohio State when I was a graduate assistant there; punted a long time in the NFL.” \nHartbarger is averaging 42.3 yards per punt, with nine of his 23 kicks carrying more than 50 yards. If he were eligible for the NCAA rankings – he hasn’t punted enough apparently — he’d be in the top 50 punters in college football. \nHartbarger’s problem, as much as dropping snaps, has been out-kicking his coverage, as Dantonio said he did against Oregon. \nStill, better that than the alternative. Actually, better a dropped snap than Saturday’s alternative. If Hartarger booms two of four punts, shanks one and drops another, the Spartans would probably have been in better shape than they were with 10 seconds left. \nThe coverage problems at Western Michigan — which set the tone for this season — were on kickoffs. That appeared to be as much the result of underestimating the speed of the returner as it was the kick or the coverage. But kickoff specialist Kevin Cronin’s work hasn’t been as consistent as last year, when his 46 touchbacks were 13th most in the country. Through seven games this season, he has seven touchbacks. \n“We have to kick the ball in the end zone a little more often; we are not doing that,” Dantonio said. “So (we’ve) got to be better. There’s no other way, after seven games, there’s no other way to say it except to say it.” \nMichigan State wide receiver Matt Macksood holds as Michael Geiger attempts a field goal during the Spartans' win at Rutgers on Oct. 10. (Photo: Mel Evans, AP) \nThat goes for field goals, too. Geiger is 19 of 31 in the last 20 games, after making 15 of 16 as a freshman two years ago. \nSadler said some of his woes this season might be getting used to a new holder, Lansing Catholic grad Matt Macksood, who was perhaps a little off on his spin of the laces at Rutgers. \n“It shouldn’t be the difference between a make or miss of 28 yards,” said Sadler, Geiger’s holder the last two seasons. \nThe rest is in Geiger’s head. And seven games into a 7-0 season, with big dreams intact, MSU has to make other plans for anything beyond 30 yards. \nThis year, MSU can handle it. Even make it work to its advantage. \nOn third-and-8 from the 25-yard line, MSU is in two-down territory. \n“It forces you as a defensive play caller or as an offensive player, to change the calls,” Indiana coach Kevin Allen said. \nAnd puts immense pressure on opposing defenses. \nWith quarterback Connor Cook and MSU’s receivers, the odds of picking up a first down on two tries are in the Spartans’ favor. \nThis MSU offense, once it’s healthy up front, is capable of making up for deficiencies. The Spartans knew there was a chance they’d need that from Cook and his cohorts this season. \nThe absence of field position and field goals, though, weren’t expected to be among the added responsibilities. \nContact Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.
