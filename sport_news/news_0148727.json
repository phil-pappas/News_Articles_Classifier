In the 19 games the teams played this season, Chicago emerged with 14 victories.\nThe Cubs scored all of their runs in the first inning, with considerable help. Despite shutting out Chicago over the next eight innings, the Brewers couldn't mount a comeback.\nNewcomer Jorge Lopez's first start at Miller Park began terribly as he hit Cubs leadoff hitter Austin Jackson with a pitch, then walked Chris Coghlan and Kris Bryant to load the bases with no outs.\nChicago first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who went 0-for-3 the previous evening in search for his 100th RBI, moved past that benchmark with a two-run single to right. Lopez prevented the inning from completely blowing up by getting Starlin Castro to ground into a double play as the third run of the inning scored.\nLopez had to battle over the next four innings but successfully did so to keep the Cubs from adding to their lead. He exited after the fifth, having allowed six hits, three walks and the three runs.\nIn the meantime, the Brewers were having little luck against Cubs veteran Dan Haren. They did scratch across a run in the third inning, when a bigger opportunity slipped away.\nWith Jean Segura (single, sacrifice by Lopez) on second base with two down, Scooter Gennett drew a walk. Shane Peterson followed with a drive to left that bounced over the wall for an RBI ground-rule double. Had the ball stayed in play, Gennett also would have scored but he was stranded when Adam Lind grounded out.\nKhris Davis gave the Brewers hope for another run when he led off the fourth with a double to left. With one down, he was caught off base on Hernan Perez's comebacker to Haren, however, and tagged out in a run down.\nAfter that, it was slim pickings for the Brewers' offense. They didn't come close to scoring another run, finishing with only two in the three-game series.\nThere was one noteworthy occurrence near the end of the game. Brewers reliever Will Smith struck out four hitters in the ninth, with Addison Russell reaching base by whiffing on a wild pitch.\n(c)2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\nVisit the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel at www.jsonline.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1732626&h=Brewers%27+dismal+season+ends+with+another+loss+to+Cubs", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1732626&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1732626"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:22:04.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
