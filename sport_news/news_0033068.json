The Jets are bringing back a familiar face.\nGang Green is re-signing punter Steve Weatherford, according to sources. Weatherford will, at least temporarily, replace Ryan Quigley who has a right shin injury and was added to the injury report Saturday as questionable for Sunday's contest against the Patriots. It’s unclear when Quigley suffered the injury, but one possibility is that he was hurt when his punt was blocked by Washington last week. It’s also unknown how long he is expected to be out.\nWeatherford was with the Jets in 2009 and 2010 before heading across New Jersey to join the Giants in from 2011-2014. He was cut by the Giants in early September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:57:34.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
