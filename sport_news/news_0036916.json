Arkansas coach Bret Bielema hasn't defeated Alabama in his tenure with the Razorbacks and called the 2013 52-0 loss \" one of the most embarrassing losses for me as a head coach. \nAL.com has extensively covered Alabama this week, but to get a closer look at Arkansas we've sought some outside help. Eric Bolin, who covers Arkansas for the Arkansas News Bureau, graciously answered five questions about this weekend's game. You can follow Bolin on Twitter ( @ericwbolin ) and check out his Arkansas coverage here. \n1) Arkansas came in as an SEC West dark horse, but hasn't lived up to expectations. What are the primary reasons the Razorbacks already have three losses? \nWhere to start? The reasons are multiple and varied. Almost nothing went right against Toledo. Texas Tech was a 50/50 game -- 50 percent good, 50 percent bad. Then Texas A&M was mostly good with a few glaring issues. The largest common thread has been penalties and the red zone. Before the Tennessee game, Arkansas was last in the SEC in penalties and total yardage. It had the worst red zone conversion rate, too. The team is moving the ball plenty well, and despite a low-ranked pass defense (more a product of opposition than themselves), that whole side has been decent. Penalties were cleared up against Tennessee and it finally led to a win. The red zone stuff is bad. Arkansas is tied with Old Dominion, fourth from the bottom in all FBS. \n2) How has Jonathan William's absence impacted Arkansas' offense? \nLess and less lately. Williams was lost in the team's first fall scrimmage to a broke foot. Coaching staff, of course, said no big deal. Things are good. Status quo. Kody Walker and Rawleigh Williams III were going to just fill in the missing 210 carries. Of course it didn't work out that way. And combined with some serious issues along the offensive line and its inability to pass block -- for whatever reason, take your pick -- the first couple games left a lot to be desired rushing. That said, Alex Collins has run for at least 150 yards the last three times out and Rawleigh Williams, a freshman, is beginning to figure out things. \n3) What was the reaction around the program to the Tennessee win given the struggles? And what kind of momentum, if any, do you see that giving Arkansas headed into this game? \nThe Tennessee win felt like a giant exhale both post-game and even through this week around campus and the football center. Coach Bret Bielema had talked the last couple weeks about the team getting better and while it was true each subsequent time out, the lack of a win was haunting. If nothing else, beating the Vols proved Arkansas' season isn't totally dead-on-arrival. The momentum would be huge, I think, given any other opponent. But considering Alabama's absolute dominance in the series the last several years, any built momentum could be quickly sent back to par after Saturday. Outcome pending, obviously. \n4) Can Arkansas stop a Derrick Henry-heavy Alabama offense? \nActually, yes. There are no guarantees. Not sure, even, if there is a strong likelihood. It's a possibility, though. And a bigger one than probably it should be. To a lot of people in Arkansas the defensive line has been something of a disappointment. They haven't been bad, but the unit's lack of quarterback pressure has left them last in the league in sacks. It's less sexy so it goes less recognized, but the flip side is the Razorbacks are third in the league against the run. And it's with a batch of very inexperienced linebackers. Brooks Ellis is there and he's a third-team All-SEC type, but the playmaker is a freshman and and third starter -- when the team runs a three-linebacker set, which isn't often -- has 11 career tackles. The defensive line is underratedly good. \n5) If Arkansas wins Saturday, what would have happened for the Razorbacks ? \nArkansas has to have an A-game if Alabama has even a B- or better. That and a little luck. Arkansas is less talented in like positions across the board except at quarterback. And while that is an important position, given both team's styles and the relatively small gap between Jake Coker and Brandon Allen, it's hardly a difference maker. That isn't to say the Razorbacks are untalented. There is a reason most of the league's coaches and media thought so highly of them in the summer. The potential is there, I'm just not sure Alabama is the type of team in which that potential unlocked. I figure the 17-point, or so, spread, is pretty realistic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:31:50.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
