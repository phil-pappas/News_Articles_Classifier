Phillip) Browse for Republican American Reprints CHICAGO (AP) -- A day later, Theo Epstein was ready to start again.Next season can't come soon enough for the Cubs executive after Chicago wrapped up a year he described Thursday as \"magical.\"Yes, it was quite a ride.The Cubs put five consecutive losing seasons behind them and emerged as one of the best teams in baseball, led by young players and veterans and a manager in Joe Maddon who pulled all the right strings in getting the franchise back in the postseason.It ended Wednesday with the New York Mets completing a four-game sweep in the NL Championship Series, but the Cubs already believe they have what it takes to contend again next season.\"We know what we have here,\" All-Star rookie Kris Bryant said.What they have is a team that often started four rookies, won 97 games and then knocked out the two teams that finished with better records — NL Central rivals St. Louis and Pittsburgh — in the playoffs.
