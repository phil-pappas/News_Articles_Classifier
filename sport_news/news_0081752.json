Senior receiver Justin Hardee has suffered a setback, Cubit said, that could jeopardize his return from a foot injury. Illinois' active receivers are mostly freshmen and older players without much experience.\nAllison, a 6-foot-4 senior who transferred in 2014 from Iowa Western Community College, is the most dependable of the bunch. And the Illini are desperate for him to remain reliable in Saturday's Big Ten opener against Nebraska.\n\"Like most junior-college guys, the second year is where he is blossoming,\" Cubit said. \"He works hard. Now he understands how it has to be to get work in during the week. I give him a lot of credit. I know he's working so hard, I back him off a little, give him some rest at practice.\"\nThe fact that Allison, known as \"G-Mo\" among his teammates, has been voted a team captain three straight weeks is telling.\nAdded to the Biletnikoff Award watch list this week, he ranks third among Big Ten receivers and 22nd nationally with 362 yards on 24 catches. Against Middle Tennessee he had a career-high 10 catches for 128 yards.\nAllison takes his job as the leader of the receiving corps as seriously as he does catching passes. He checks up on his teammates' independent film study and acts as a conduit between them and quarterback Wes Lunt, \"so we're all on the same page.\"\nCubit has said the young receivers lose focus at times, part of the reason for 26 drops in four games.\n\"I definitely have to help out with the guys and answer questions that they may struggle with,\" Allison said. \"At the same time, they have to be a student of the game and follow along and follow in my footsteps and feed off my energy I try to play with.\"\nWith tight ends Tim Clary and Tyler White out last week with injuries, more responsibility was heaped on Allison and his fellow receivers. Clary remains out after hand surgery; White (concussion) is expected to return.\nAllison said he welcomes the challenges and opportunities.\n\"I embrace it,\" he said. \"At the same time, I just want to keep my job and do my job the best I can. I just try to make every play come my way.\"\nsryan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @sryantribune\n Illinois Fighting Illini Iowa Hawkeyes Nebraska Cornhuskers", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560de569/turbine/ct-geronimo-allison-illinois-receivers-spt-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:11:55.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
