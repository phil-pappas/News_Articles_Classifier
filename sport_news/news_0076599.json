Here are some of the highlights:\nQuestion: What did you think of UT win over OU? Is UT better than we thought or OU not as good?\nSherrington: Little bit of both. For all the Longhorns' problems this season, they very easily could have beaten both Cal and Oklahoma State. Now you're talking an entirely different season. Now I didn't think they'd beat Oklahoma, but the reason you have to believe in Charlie Strong is that he's been a very good coach throughout his career. A terrific DC, and he did a really good job as head coach at Louisville. Granted, Texas is a different animal, but the issues Texas has had so far didn't seem to have anything to do with the areas that make Texas different. They just weren't playing well on defense. Well, he fixed that against Oklahoma. And for the second year in a row, an OU team that looked to have national aspirations comes up short. Bob Stoops has clearly plateaued at OU. Off the top of my head, I'd guess the biggest reasons are recruiting and the lack of a QB. Where are the dynamic WRs? Where is the great DL? Stryker's a big-time player, but the Sooners lack the big-play guys that once made them Texas' worst nightmare at the State Fair.\nQuestion: Is Charlie Strong's job safe now that he beat OU?\nSherrington: I wouldn't say it's safe, but it's certainly a lot better than it was. With that win, it sheds a new light on the season. Before last week, I said they'd win three games. Now it looks like there's a possibility of even going to a bowl. If they still only win three or four, he could still be in some hot water. But I don't expect him to get fired after this season. Nor should he be.\nQuestion: Did UT's win prove the players will play for Charlie Strong? I think it proves they can play when they choose to and don't often choose to.\nSherrington: I don't think that was the case at all. I think it was a case of so many younger players finally focusing on what it takes to win. By my count, 13 players on the two-deep were freshmen or redshirt freshmen. The starting LT is a freshman. It's hard to win when you've got that many young guys. What you have to remember about Texas' record, especially in the historical context, is that they've rarely played a tougher non-conference schedule. Lots of patsies most of those years, and lots among the old SWC teams, as well. They were very close to flipping their record.\nClick here to read the full chat transcript.\nOn Twitter:\n @KSherringtonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KSherringtonDMN", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1552809&ThemeId="], "published": "2015-10-15T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:45:45.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
