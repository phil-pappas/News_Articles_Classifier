And he just brought that out to the mound.”\nThey were pitches he didn’t see from Harvey during his shaky outing in Game 3 of the NLDS against the Dodgers, when he surrendered three runs in five innings and relied on a rare offensive outburst from his teammates.\nAnd when Harvey finally did get into trouble, d’Arnaud was confident Cespedes had plenty of arm to get Castro, who ill-advisedly was sent home on a Javier Baez single to left in the fifth.\n“I’ve seen Cespedes’ arm for long enough now,” d’Arnaud said. “As soon as he got to the ball, I knew he could get him. It was just a matter of me being in the right spot.”\nHe was and easily applied the tag.\nD’Arnaud even impressed the Mets’ resident playoff hero, Daniel Murphy, an inning later.\n“D’Arnaud hit one in the apple,” Murphy said. “I’ve never seen that before. I’ve been here for like I don’t know [how long]. We’ve been in this stadium since 2009. I’ve never seen someone drop it in the apple like that. That was a great at bat. Let us extend the lead.”\n  daniel murphy ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs ,  travis d'arnaud", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:17:46.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
