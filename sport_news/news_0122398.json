Sportspeople usually do well on Strictly (BBC) \nBut Thomas revealed that a few minutes on the Strictly dance floor was scarier than competing for gold on the track. \nHe said: “It was scary. I had my whole career against Michael Johnson, it was pretty amazing to look across at him and think ‘blimey, he’s fast’. But it was something I had trained for. It was my job. You know you are good at it. I knew I trained all year round. \n“Training was the hardest bit about athletics, racing was quite easy. The problem I found on Strictly was that it was subjective and it is hard.” \nThomas said he is “quite a sensitive bloke” and it was tough to take the harsh criticism dished out by the judging panel. \nHe added: “It is more nerve-racking really, in many ways, than the Olympics.” He was up against Jamelia in the dance-off (BBC) \nThomas and his professional partner Ola Jordan failed to get the judges’ hearts racing with their routines. \nTheir cha cha cha, danced to Sexy And I Know It by LMFAO, was branded “murder” by judge Bruno Tonioli and got them just 13 marks. \nAnd Thomas lost out to Jamelia and her partner Tristan MacManus in the dance-off – having bravely finished his dance despite breaking one of his shoes during the exuberant routine. \nThe runner said “the truth can hurt” and conceded he was not one of the best dancers in the show and was never going to win the glitterball trophy. So Iwan was the first celeb to go from this series…..sadly think it’s the right decision…. #scd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:09:27.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
