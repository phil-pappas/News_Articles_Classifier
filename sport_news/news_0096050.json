A win against this team in the (wild card) points would make a big difference.\" \nPoudre (3-5, 1-5 FRL) entered the week 31st in wild card points, with 32 teams making the Class 5A playoffs. \nIncluded in those losses five-straight losses is a defeat to Fairview where the would-be game-winning touchdown was stopped an inch short. There's also a last-second field goal loss to Fossil Ridge. \nThursday's narrow defeat is a story of more missed chances. \nHorizon (7-1, 6-0 FRL) is the best defensive team in 5A, allowing nine points a game. The Hawks went up 13-0 in the first quarter, but Poudre responded. \nA 40-yard strike from James Campbell to Zach Leal made it 13-7. \nNot long after the Impalas recovered a fumble. On the first play from Horizon's 25, Campbell hit Jason Wooldridge over the middle. \nRight before he crossed the goal line for the go-ahead score, he fumbled and the Hawks recovered. \nIn the second quarter Poudre also had a 27-yard screen from Campbell to Dillon Foster go for a touchdown, but it was called back on a holding penalty. \nAustin Davis hit a 47-yard field goal late in the fourth to cut Horizon's lead to seven, then executed a perfect onside kick that Poudre recovered. \nBut the Impalas final true chance at a comeback ended on the next play when Campbell was intercepted. \nPoudre's final regular season game is at 7 p.m. Oct. 30 at Mountain Range. The Impalas almost surely will need a win to have a chance of making the playoffs. \n\"They're discouraged after winning three, then losing five in a row,\" McVicker said. \"It's a tough lesson. We've just got to keep working.\" \nFollow sports reporter Kevin Lytle at twitter.com/Kevin_Lytle and at facebook.com/KevinSLytle. \nHorizon 20, Poudre 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:20:54.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
