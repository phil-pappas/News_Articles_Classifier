Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow Off to the best start in program history and coming off an 80-14 rout of Bluefield, No. 13 Reinhardt will face its toughest test of the season when it hosts No. 10 Faulkner on Saturday at Ken White Field.Not only will Faulkner be the Eagles’ most difficult opponent so far, but the game takes on even more importance as Reinhardt’s first Mid-South Conference West Division matchup of the season.“It’s a big game,” Reinhardt coach Drew Cronic said. “It’s not the end of the world if we were to lose the game, but it’s a big game. You have to step up in these big ones and see what you’re made out of.“The bottom line is, if we go out and play well, we’ll probably have a chance to win. If we don’t, we won’t. That’s how it should be. Faulkner may be the most talented team in the league, so we’re going to have our hands full.”Reinhardt (5-0) has quickly developed a rivalry with Faulkner (3-1, 0-1), with each of the teams’ first two meetings coming down to the wire, with playoff implications in the balance. In 2013, the Eagles rallied from 10 points down in the fourth quarter to win 28-24 and force a split of the MSC West title. Last season, Reinhardt came back in the fourth quarter to force overtime before falling 55-52.“This game has turned into a good, healthy rivalry. We have a lot of respect for Faulkner,” Cronic said of the team from Montgomery, Alabama. “They’re very talented and well-coached. They do a great job and, proximity-wise, they’re not as far away as some of the other schools, and they’re in the same division. You add that to the fact that we’ve played some very competitive games, and it has all the makings of a great rivalry.”Faulkner will enter Saturday’s game with some extra motivation of its own after losing 59-50 to Campbellsville last week.“It’s going to be a great challenge to see if we can hang with those guys,” Cronic said. “They got upset last week by Campbellsville, but Campbellsville is a really good team. I’m sure they’ll be trying to bounce back from that, so they’ll have their guns blazing when they show up here.”Looking to neutralize Faulkner’s motivation will be a Reinhardt offense scoring 54.6 points per game, with a season-low of 32 against Pikeville.The Eagles have been led by a tandem of running backs Niagel Curtis, L.J. Stegall, Deonte Dennis and Sam Jones — all of whom have found success on the ground this season, with a season-high 520 rushing yards against Bluefield. While no opponent has been able to stop Reinhardt’s ground game, Cronic figures he will have to throw more than the six passes his team attempted against Bluefield if they want to beat Faulkner.“We’re going to have to throw the ball against Faulkner some to win,” he said. “We like for our percentage to be a little higher than it was against Bluefield, but that game was that way. We were fortunate we didn’t have to throw it as much. There are other games where we’ve thrown 25 to 30 times, so we’ve got to be ready to do that.”Defensively, Reinhardt will have its hands full with a Faulkner team averaging 46.5 points per game. With that kind of firepower on the opposing sideline, Cronic said every single play has the potential to change the game.“We just have to do a good job in all phases and execute,” he said. “We could play well against Faulkner and have them play better than us and beat us. It’s one of those games where you have to be solid in all three phases, and the bottom line is we have to make some plays. You have two things going on — whoever makes the fewest mistakes and whoever makes the most plays. That’s going to determine what happens.”A win this weekend would be another step towards a matchup with current No. 1 Lindsey Wilson on Oct. 24, but Cronic said his team has stayed focused on the task at hand and not looked ahead.“I keep saying that our guys are pretty mature, so I think they’ve bought into that one-day-at-a-time thing,” he said. “I think they understand where we are and what’s in front of us. They’ve handled that pretty well. We’ve had a good week of practice, and I expect us to come out highly motivated and ready to play on Saturday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:03:10.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
