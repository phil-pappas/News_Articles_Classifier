Pleasant quarterback Joe Hess threw for 276 yards, three touchdowns and one interception in Friday’s game at Washington. The Panthers fell in the district contest, 42-24. \nBY AARON VINER \nGolden Triangle News Service \nWASHINGTON — A quick start was too much to overcome for Mt. Pleasant on Friday night. \nThe Panthers saw their rival, Washington, jump out to a quick 14-point lead, and despite a late rally, Mt. Pleasant was unable to come back in the game, falling 42-24 against the Demons. \nThe loss drops Mt. Pleasant to 0-8 on the season with one game remaining. \n“We’ve had a rough season and we started off the year with high hopes,” Mt. Pleasant head coach Shawn Striegle said. “We got down mentally and physically, where we were giving up in games and we were making mistakes. We were just looking to play right and play hard the whole 48 minutes.” \nMt. Pleasant’s passing attack was effective in the game, as senior quarterback Joe Hess picked up 276 yards and three touchdowns, completing at least two passes to five different receivers. \nJunior receiver DShundric Foster led the way in receiving with two catches for 115 yards, which included a 99-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter. \nWashington started the scoring off quickly, taking the opening kickoff and marching down the field, with sophomore quarterback Ryan Reighard finding sophomore Jaivonn Willis for a 30-yard score two minutes into the game. \nThe Demon defense forced a three and out and tipped the Mt. Pleasant punt, to take over at the Panther 44-yard line, and after two plays, Demon senior Jack Giardino scampered 35 yards for the touchdown with 8:30 to go in the first quarter. \nThe next two Panther drives came away with missed field goals, but a second-quarter interception by Foster put Mt. Pleasant in business. Pat Canby caught a screen pass and broke a tackle behind the line of scrimmage before breaking off a 42-yard run to the end zone, making it 14-6 Washington. \nA Demon fumble on the next drive led to a Mt. Pleasant interception, as Willis earned the pick. That turnover was converted to points a couple of plays later, as senior Ethan Hansen ran 15 yards on a jet sweep to pick up the touchdown. \nA late second-quarter touchdown run by Reighard made it 28-6 at halftime. \nAfter Mt. Pleasant went three-and-out to start the second half, the Demons capitalized on a fourth-down play, when Reighard found Willis for the second time in the game, this time from 40-yards out. \nThe Demons were forced to punt on the ensuing possession, pinning the Panthers down at the 1-yard line. Hess then found Foster for a 99-yard score to start closing the Demon lead, making it 35-12. \nAfter the Panthers turned it over on downs, Reighard hit Willis for their third touchdown connection in the game, but Mt. Pleasant wasn’t ready to give in quite yet. \nHess found Jack Davis for a 17-yard touchdown pass to make it 42-18, and after a blocked Washington punt, Canby rushed in a score from one-yard out to close the gap to 42-24. \nThe Mt. Pleasant onside kick attempt failed, however, and Washington was able to run the clock out on the Panthers. \n“I’m extremely proud of the effort,” Striegle said. “We had mistakes but there are things we can do that are simple which we have to get understood to help ourselves out. We have a great group of kids and they fight hard together. I’m extremely proud of them.” \nMt. Pleasant will look to wrap up its season on the road at Fort Madison on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:59:59.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
