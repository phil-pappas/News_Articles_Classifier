(AP) - Though Buffalo Bills starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor has a sprained left knee, coach Rex Ryan won't entirely rule him out from playing against Cincinnati on Sunday.\nRyan provided the update before the team's practice on Wednesday. Ryan said Taylor would practice on a limited basis, with backup EJ Manuel taking a majority of the snaps.\nRyan disputed reports that Taylor could miss as many as three weeks because of the injury.\n\"That's news to me. That may or may not be the case,\" Ryan said. \"It's certainly not official. So we'll see how it goes.\"\nIf Taylor can't play against the Bengals (5-0), Manuel will make his first start in more than a year. The Bills (3-2), who traded veteran Matt Cassel to Dallas three weeks ago, addressed their depth at quarterback by signing six-year journeyman Josh Johnson on Tuesday.\nTaylor was hurt while rallying the Bills to score two touchdowns in the final 16-1/2 minutes in a 14-13 win at Tennessee on Sunday. He missed one play after his left leg bent awkwardly after being pulled down by the back of his jersey by linebacker Zach Brown following a 24-yard scramble midway through the fourth quarter. Brown was penalized 15 yards for a horse-collar tackle.\nTaylor then returned and capped the victory with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan.\nTaylor had a team-best 76 yards rushing - the most by a Bills quarterback in team history.\nHe's a first-time starter who won a three-way competition this offseason because he presents a dual threat with a strong arm and mobility. Taylor signed with Buffalo in March after spending his first four seasons backing up Joe Flacco in Baltimore.\nManuel has a 6-8 record since being the only quarterback selected in the first round of the 2013 draft. Inconsistency and injuries hampered him in going 4-6 during his rookie season. He missed six starts after being sidelined three separate times because of knee injuries.\nLast season, Manuel got off to a 2-2 start before being benched in place of veteran journeyman Kyle Orton.\nManuel has yet to attempt a pass in two appearances this season, including mop-up duties in a 41-14 win at Miami on Sept. 27.\nHe hasn't started since a 23-17 loss at Houston on Sept. 28 last season, when he went 21 of 44 for 225 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions, including one returned by J.J. Watt for an 80-yard touchdown.\nThe quarterback position has been unsettled since Jim Kelly retired following the 1996 season, and a revolving door since Manuel arrived. Taylor became the fifth quarterback to start a game in Buffalo since the start of the 2013 season.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:21:20.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
