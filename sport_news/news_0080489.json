(Image Source: Andrew Weber/Getty Images) \nBig Ten East division power rankings following Week 7: \n(1) Ohio State Buckeyes (1); Record: 7-0 (3-0) \nLast Week: Won vs. Penn State 38-10 \nWith J.T. Barrett getting more and more playing time as the season progresses, the Buckeyes went to the ground game against PSU, rushing for 315 yards on 50 carries (vs. 19 pass attempts) as a team (including -16 yards on 4 “rushes” by Cardale Jones ). Barrett is brilliant running the read option, particularly in the red zone and he was incredibly efficient on Saturday night completing all four of his passes, including two TDs, while rushing for 102 yards and two more scores on just 11 carries. That’s why it came as no surprise that Urban Meyer finally named him the starting QB. \nComing Up: 10/24: @ Rutgers; 10/31: Idle \n(2) Michigan State Spartans; Record (3): 7-0 (3-0) \nLast Week: Won @ Michigan 27-23 \nThat was maybe the most-improbably finish I’ve ever seen. Saturday’s win over Michigan in Ann Arbor helps keep the Spartans in the playoff race in that they remain undefeated however that doesn’t mean they are a playoff-caliber team. That remains to be seen. Neither team was able to run the ball and while QB Connor Cook completed fewer than half his passes his 328 passing yards kept Sparty in the game and allowed them to take advantage of Michigan’s last-minute blunder. \nComing Up: 10/24: vs. Indiana; 10/31: Idle \n(3) Michigan Wolverines (2); Record: 5-2 (2-1) \nLast Week: Lost vs. Michigan State 27-23 \nWow. Just. Wow. The muffed snap-turned-TD by punter Blake O’Neill is simply unfathomable. It can’t happen except it did. Make no mistake…that final play cost the Wolverines the contest but that doesn’t mean the Maize and Blue played a perfect game. There were too many breakdowns in the pass defense—four plays of 27-plus yards—and the rushing attack regressed ( De’Veon Smith was held to 46 yards on 19 carries) against a tougher front seven than they’ve faced during their winning streak. \nComing Up: 10/24: Idle; 10/31: @ Minnesota \n(4) Penn State Nittany Lions (4); Record: 5-2 (2-1) \nLast Week: Lost @ Ohio State 38-10 \nYoungsters, sophomore WR Chris Godwin and freshman RB Saquon Barkley , had strong efforts, but their lack of run D and inability to extend (1 of 12 on 3 rd downs; 0 of 2 on fourth downs) or finish drives cost them in the end. Barkley (26 carries, 194 yards) is the type of difference maker the Nittany Lions have lacked in the backfield and if he can stay healthy maybe PSU can surprise some people before it’s all said and done. This week’s game in Baltimore is an opportunity to get on a roll. \nComing Up: 10/24: vs. Maryland; 10/31: vs. Illinois \n(5) Rutgers Scarlet Knights (5); Record: 3-3 (1-2) \nLast Week: Won @ Indiana 55-52 \nSenior WR Leonte Carroo had his second-straight three-touchdown game, however he was injured (game-time decision for this week) on his final trip to the painted area, which meant the Scarlet Knights would have to overcome a 19-point fourth-quarter deficit without their best player. No problem. A defensive score pulled RU to within 13-points and their balanced offense won the day in the end. QB Chris Laviano (386 yards) threw three TD passes and RB Robert Martin (124 yards) ran for three scores as Rutgers pulled back to .500 with their first B1G win of the season. \nComing Up: 10/24: vs. Ohio State; 10/31: @ Wisconsin \n(6) Indiana Hoosiers (6); Record: 4-3 (0-3) \nLast Week: Lost vs. Rutgers 55-52 \nNationally and around the Big Ten, Michigan’s loss was the one that got the most headlines, but the Hoosiers suffered a pretty brutal defeat of their own in Bloomington. After scoring four touchdowns in the first 10 minutes of the third quarter, the Hoosiers led 52-27 and presumably were well on their way to their fifth win of the season. QB Nate Sudfeld (464 yards, 4 TDs) was back and so was IU’s explosive attack. However, things imploded after that and IU was outscored 28-0 over the final 20 minutes as their D failed them yet again. \nComing Up: 10/24: @ Michigan State; 10/31: Idle \n(7) Maryland Terrapins (7); Record: 2-4 (0-2) \nLast Week: Idle \nThe Mike Locksley era begins on Saturday against rival PSU, but the changes have already begun in College Park. Locksley has moved sophomore Shane Cockerille from fullback back to quarterback. Perry Hills remains the starter, but the way Hills and Caleb Rowe have performed I wouldn’t be surprised to see Cockerille under center at some point this season. \nComing Up: 10/24: vs. Penn State; 10/31: @ Iowa \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
