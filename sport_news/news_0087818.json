No matter what happened in the game, they kept their heads up and gutted it out.\" \nLincoln 27, Huntsvlle 26 \nHuntsville^0^7^7^12^-^26 \nLincoln^7^14^0^6^-^27 \nFirst Quarter \nLinc – Barnum 89 pass from Lloyd (Villapondo kick), 9:05 \nSecond Quarter \nHunts – Lemus 55 run (Aldaco kick), 8:19 \nLinc – Lloyd 6 run (Villapondo kick), 2:30 \nLinc – Swayne 15 run (Villapondo kick), 1:07 \nThird Quarter \nHunts – Lemus 43 run (Aldaco kick), 3:25 \nFourth Quarter \nHunts – Lemus 21 run (run failed), 10:03 \nLinc – Adams 1 run (kick failed), 5:35 \nHunts – Weaver 3 run (kick failed), 1:15 \nBoth teams converted their extra points perfectly through the first three quarters, but neither team was able to get a ball through the uprights in the fourth, keeping the result of the game in doubt until Huntsville (3-4, 1-3) failed to recover an onside kick at the end. \nThe Eagles opened the fourth quarter down 21-14, but quarterback Will Weaver and running back Brian Lemus, who had a game-high 167 rushing yards on just 16 carries, traded rushes and went 45 yards in five plays, capped by Lemus' 21-yard touchdown to cut the lead to 21-20 with 10:03 left. But the snap was mishandled, forcing kicker Manuel Aldaco to pick up the ball and try to run. But Lincoln (3-4, 2-2) was able to tackle him and cling to the one-point lead. \nLincoln answered on the ensuing drive by converting a fourth down to set up senior lineman David Adams' touchdown run. Huntsville still had life, however, because it was able to block Estabon Villapondo's extra point attempt. \nThe Eagles started their final drive at their own 47-yard line with 5:27 to play, and again, Weaver and Lemus marched Huntsville down the field on a 12-play drive that resulted in a 3-yard touchdown run by Weaver with 1:15 left. Huntsville elected to go for the tie and send the game to overtime, and that's when the deciding kick missed. \nLincoln only trailed for a few minutes in the game. They stopped Huntsville on the game's opening drive, and on their first play, they ran a halfback pass with freshman running back Caleb Lloyd launching an 89-yard touchdown pass to Barnum. \n\"Our freshman tailback has quite an arm,\" said Harrison. \"We thought they would come up early in the game so we ran a sweep pass, and (Lloyd) threw it just perfectly.\" \nLincoln also managed to get two key scores just before halftime on runs by Lloyd and Swayne. Swayne also completed 9-of-18 passes for 159 yards. \n\"That was big,\" said Harrison. \"We practice the two-minute drill so much, and for them to come out and execute it so clean was big for us.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:00:44.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
