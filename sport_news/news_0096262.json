The Frostburg defense limited the Lions (0-5, 0-4) to just 277 yards in offense. \nSpecial teams again played an important role for Frostburg. Robinson connected on a 32-yard field goal in the second quarter for a 3-0 lead and added a 30-yarder early in the fourth as the Bobcats surged ahead 19-0. Frostburg dropped three punts inside the TCNJ 20 and senior Roland Kamara blocked a kick (extra point) for the fourth time this season. \nIn between Robinson’s field goals, Cox tossed a six-yard scoring strike to senior wideout Antonio Wood, who managed to get a foot down in the back of the end zone with 26 seconds left in the second quarter. \nLate in the third, Frostburg put together an eight play, 83-yard drive that culminated in a 20-yard touchdown toss from Beckford to junior Austin Bonsall as FSU led 16-0. \nA large chunk of TCNJ’s offensive output came with just over six minutes left in the fourth quarter when it drove 75 yards on eight plays for a score. Michael Marchesano scored from six yards out on a quarterback keeper. Kamara blocked the extra point to keep the score at 19-6. \nCox finished 7-of-14 for 96 yards and one touchdown, while Beckford was 4-of-6 for 92 yards and a score. \nBonsall, one of the nation’s top punt returners, had an explosive day on offense as he hauled in three passes for 103 yards and a score. Bonsall caught a 56-yard pass in front of the TCNJ sideline just a handful of plays prior to his touchdown. It’s Frostburg’s longest play from scrimmage this season. \nJunior J.R. Lowery paved the way on defense with eight tackles, two tackles for loss and one sack. Junior Matt Capozza made seven stops, one for loss with an interception. \nMarchesano led the Lions with 161 yards passing on 16 of 28 attempts, Victory Scalici ran for 66 yards on 14 carries. \nFrostburg visits Christopher Newport on Saturday at 7 p.m.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:53:05.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
