With losses to Higginsville, Grain Valley, Mexico and Fulton on the road this season, the Pirates had hopes of ending the four-game skid against the 2-6 Owls. Unfortunately for Boonville, they had another slow start while Marshall came out blazing with 28 first-half points en route to a 35-14 victory. While the loss dropped the Pirates to 2-7 overall and 1-5 in the NCMC, Marshall improved to 3-6 overall 3-3 in the conference. Of course if you thought the loss to Marshall was bad news, the Pirates learned after the game that they will make a return trip to Fulton for the first round of the Class 3 District 6 playoffs on Friday, Oct. 23rd starting at 7 p.m. The Hornets, who finished the regular season at 7-2 overall, beat Boonville in Week 7 in Fulton by a score of 47-13. Blair Oaks received the No. 1 seed in the Class 3 District 3 playoffs at 9-0, followed by Fulton at 7-2, California at 6-3, Owensville at 4-5, Eldon at 6-3, Southern Boone at 5-4, Boonville at 2-7 and Versailles at 3-6. In other matchups this coming Friday, Blair Oaks will host Versailles; California will host Southern Boone; and Owensville will host Eldon. The semifinal round of the district tournament will be held on Friday, Oct. 30th, with the championship scheduled on November 6th. As for the loss against Marshall, Boonville Pirates football coach Barry Blank said he thought his team came out really flat but thought his team matched up with the Owls. “We just didn’t make things happen offensively and had too many three and outs,” Blank said. “Defensively, we weren’t very physical at the point of attack. We were catching guys and we were catching blockers but when we tried to tackle we were reaching and grabbing and those are things that our kids know but they have to get better at. They just have to trust their abilities to play. I thought the kids continued to play hard in the second half. We outscored Marshall 14-7 in the second half but that’s not what counts. When you are in a 28-point hole it makes it tough.” It also stings a little bit when Marshall comes out and scores on its first-three possessions to lead 21-0. While the Pirates finished the first half with two punts, one fumble and one turnover on downs, the Owls were a little more efficient on offense in the first half with four touchdowns and one fumble. Marshall also doubled its offensive output against Boonville in the first half 313-116. Add it up and it’s no wonder the Pirates trailed 28-0 at the half after giving up two touchdowns in the first quarter on a 23-yard run by senior quarterback Zach Maupin with 9:03 left and a 22-yard run by junior Erik Mays with 4:16 remaining to make it 14-0. Meanwhile, in the second quarter, the Owls hit paydirt again on a 6-yard run by Mays with 8:42 left in the half to extend the lead to 21-0. Page 2 of 3 - As for the Pirates, they had two three and outs in the first half and one possession end at the Owls 8-yard line on fourth down. Meanwhile, on the third possession, Boonville had another good seven-play drive down to the Marshall 29 but turned it back over to the Owls via a fumble. Then, after another three and out, Marshall hit paydirt for the fourth time in the half on a 18-yard scoring strike from Maupin to May to push the lead to 28-0 with 26 seconds left in the half. The Owls also had all of the scoring in the third quarter when senior Garrett Clouse hit paydirt on a 1-yard run with 7:47 left to extend the lead to 35-0. Marshall then got a little too greedy by attempting an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff. Unfortunately for the Pirates, it worked as the Owls recovered the ball at the Boonville 43. Marshall and Boonville played giveaway after that with both teams putting the ball on the ground. Then, after Boonville recovered a Marshall fumble at the Owls 13, junior quarterback Nick Zeitlow hit Dalton Bealmer in the middle of the end zone for a touchdown with 11:55 left in the fourth quarter to make it 35-7. The Owls played a little kick ball after that while punting on their next-two possessions. Meanwhile, after taking over at their own 28, the Pirates initiated a 14-play, 62-yard drive for their second touchdown of the ballgame on a 5-yard run by Bealmer. Boonville also had a little better luck offensively in the second half while scoring two touchdowns and punting just once. The Pirates also turned the ball back over to Marshall on downs twice in the second half. As for the Owls, they finished the second half with just one touchdown, two punts and two fumbles. Blank said his team was just rushing throws in the first half. “We weren’t blocking very well up front at times, either,”Blank said. As for game totals, Marshall had 14 first downs along with 186 yards rushing and another 215 passing for a total of 401. Boonville, meanwhile, finished the first half with 10 first downs and 93 yards rushing and 172 passing for a total of 265. On an individual note, senior Jordan Weaver had 16 rushes for 70 yards while Zeitlow completed 14 of 29 passes for 172 yards and one touchdown. Makiah Waibel led the Pirates in receiving yards with four catches for 42 yards while Adam Edler had three catches for 39 yards, Bryce Fuemmeler one for 39 yards and Dalton Bealmer with four catches for 33 yards and one touchdown. For Marshall, Erik Mays finished the game with 19 carries for 98 yards and two touchdowns while Zach Maupin had 14 carries for 43 yards and one score. Maupin also completed 12 of 14 passes for 215 yards and one touchdown. On the receiving in, Mays hauled in four catches for 103 yards and one score while Garrett Harvey had four catches for 70 yards.
