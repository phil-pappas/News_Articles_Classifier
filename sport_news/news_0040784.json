(AP) â€” A man who was sleeping inside a downtown Olympia dumpster ended up inside a garbage truck.\nThe Olympian reports ( http://bit.ly/1PgeK9b ) that the incident happened when a driver of a front-loading truck was empting dumpsters last week. As he loaded a dumpster behind Three Magnets Brewery, he caught a glimpse of a person falling into the truck.\nRescue workers were called and they had to remove the garbage from the truck to the man out. He was taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries.\nMark Cotey, the waste resources supervisor for the city, said the man was lucky to be alive.\n___\nInformation from: The Olympian, http://www.theolympian.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1PgeK9b", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:50:43.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
