Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant played in only 35 games last season after suffering a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder, and the 37-year-old star claims the 2015-16 campaign could be his final one in the NBA.\nAdChoices Lakers fans are hoping he has enough left in the tank to last the entirety of the season and that he can help the team return to the playoffs.\nBryant, however, got banged up a bit in Tuesday’s exhibition game against the Sacramento Kings.\nThe Lakers guard drove to the hoop but banged knees with Rajon Rondo in doing so. He did stay in the game for a short while but later went to the sideline to get checked out, and then made his way to the locker room.\nThe team announced Bryant suffered a lower-leg contusion, and he did not return to the game. The nature of the injury didn’t look to be too serious, but you can’t blame the team for being careful with its superstar.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BaxterHolmes/status/654140320653819904", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/8/4/9095557/kobe-bryant-retires-la-lakers", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:22:27.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
