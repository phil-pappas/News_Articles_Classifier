The impending free agent faced only three over the minimum. \nJimmy Rollins singled in the fourth for the Dodgers, who remain one game behind the New York Mets for the No. 2 seed in the NL. The two teams will play each other in the NL Division Series, though homefield advantage for that showdown has yet to be decided. \nMatt Duffy hit his 12th home run of the season off Dodgers starter Mike Bolsinger (6-6). \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:01:15.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
