He totaled 107 yards receiving on eight catches in Sunday's 30-27 49ers loss to the New York Giants. \nBut perhaps the biggest contribution of the 13-year veteran was the mental work he did on his quarterback. \nBoldin declined to comment after the 49ers offense stunk it up and Colin Kaepernick looked terrible against Green Bay. Early last week, he had a heart-to-heart with the quarterback. By the end of the week, Boldin was back to commenting, telling how great his relationship was with Kaepernick. \nThen, he used that chemistry to team up with Kaepernick for some game-changing plays. \nHe had the big gain that seemed to wake up the 49ers offense in the third quarter, a 37-yard reception. He then scored a touchdown to tie it up, changing the tone of the game. And the 49ers' season, for that matter. \nKaepernick had some of his mojo back. And because of it, the 49ers had some life. Assist to Anquan. \n\"I told him to have fun and be yourself,\" Boldin said. \"I didn't want him to put pressure on himself. I told him to just put it on us. Let us make the plays for you. Just take the pressure off yourself and go out and have fun and let it rip.\" \nBoldin hadn't topped 90 yards receiving in a game since the 11th game of last season, when he torched Washington for 137 yards and a score. Advertisement \nBut he looked like the old Boldin, the reliable producer Kaepernick once leaned on heavily. \nTheir connection seemed to be fading the last couple weeks. Boldin's frustration was visible as Kaepernick sailed throws over his head. He and Kaepernick were back in rhythm against the Giants. \nOver the first four games, Kaepernick had thrown to Boldin 25 times, connecting on 15. Sunday, Boldin was targeted 12 times, connecting on two-thirds of those. \nKaepernick also looked for Torrey Smith, who drew three penalties as the 49ers actually attacked the Giants secondary, after weeks of dinks and dunks and fruitless runs. \n\"I thought he felt comfortable,\" Boldin said of Kaepernick. \"He came to us and told us he was going to give us a chance, especially if we had one on one coverage outside.\" \nHow much did it help Kaepernick's confidence that Boldin was encouraging during the week in the worst stretch of the quarterback's career? How good did it feel for Kaepernick, after all his struggles, to throw a deep ball and have Boldin come down with it? \nFor the first time this season, Boldin came up big for the 49ers. Even more than with just the passes he caught.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:45:14.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
