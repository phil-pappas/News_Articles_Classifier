Their 15-6 victory this morning was crucial, sending Wales to what will be a tough match against South Africa, who have bounced back from their opening humiliation at the hands of Japan. England's win over Uruguay this morning leaves Pool A as the only completed pool so far. \nPOOL BUSA - Eliminated[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/Scotland edging out Samoa this morning eliminates the plucky Japanese from the tournament before they play the USA. However, Japan will finish third in the pool and qualify for the 2019 World Cup hosted in their own country. Meanwhile, South Africa progress atop the pool to advance to probably the tastiest quarter-final of them all, against the Welsh. \nRemaining GamesNamibia - Eliminated[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/It was never really in doubt that the All Blacks and Argentina would progress in first and second respectively. All that's left is to see which team from Pool D will be given the task of toppling the world number one, and which will take on Argentina. \nRemaining GamesArgentina v Namibia, Leicester City StadiumPOOL DRomania - Eliminated[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/Italy's lack of fight in Pool D has left it as an easy two horse race for top spot in Pool D - which will be decided tomorrow morning when France take on Ireland at Millennium Stadium. The loser has to face the All Blacks, and neither team particularly fancies that prospect. \nRemaining GamesItaly v Romania, Sandy ParkFrance v Ireland, Millennium StadiumQuarter-finals outlookQF 1 - South Africa v Wales, TwickenhamQF 2 - All Blacks v Ireland/France, Millennium Stadium \n- Winners to face off in semifinal 1October 19QF 3 - France/Ireland v Argentina, Millennium Stadium \nQF 4 - Australia v Scotland, Twickenham- Winners to face off in semifinal 2[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:26:09.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
