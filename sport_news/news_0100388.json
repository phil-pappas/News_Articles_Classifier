Mettenberger, a sixth-round draft pick in 2014, started six of the seven games he played in last season, all of them Titans losses. He completed 59.8 percent of his passes for 1,412 yards, eight touchdowns, seven interceptions and an 84.4 passer rating. Miami Dolphins DE Oliver Vernon fined $17,363 for low hit on Marcus Mariota \nMariota was injured on a low, late hit by Dolphins defensive end Olivier Vernon in the second quarter of a 38-10 loss Sunday in Nashville. Mariota, the second overall pick in this year’s draft, remained in the game and committed four turnovers before being replaced by Mettenberger for the team’s final possession. Mettenberger completed 5 of 8 passes for 63 yards. \nThe NFL has fined Vernon $37,363 for two roughing the passer penalties against Mariota. He’s docked $17,363 for the low hit and $20,000 for a hit to the head. \nThe Titans (1-4) have lost four games in a row and eight consecutive at home. \nJason Wolf writes for The Tennessean.
