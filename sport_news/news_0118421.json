WALKERAP Pro Football Writer \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Cameron Wake got his first four sacks this season and also forced two fumbles - all in the first half - and the Miami Dolphins routed the Tennessee Titans 38-10 on Sunday in Dan Campbell's debut as interim coach. \nThe Dolphins (2-3) came in having lost three straight, costing coach Joe Philbin his job Oct. 5. \nWith Campbell preaching a more fun and physical approach, the Dolphins finished with six sacks and intercepted Marcus Mariota twice. The rookie quarterback needed a knee brace and was replaced by Zach Mettenberger after the 2-minute warning. \nMiami had been one of two teams in the NFL without a rushing touchdown, but Jarvis Landry ended the drought with a TD run, and Lamar Miller ran for 113 yards and a TD. \nThe Titans (1-4) lost their fourth straight, and their home skid is up to eight dating to last season. \nOnline: \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nFollow Teresa M.
