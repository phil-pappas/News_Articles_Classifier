San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick once cruised around NFL football fields like he was driving a Ferrari, but the wheels have come off this season as he has thrown five interceptions and his team has lost three straight games.\n“He’s got to go back under the hood and correct and improve,” offensive coordinator Geep Chryst said, “so that when he goes back out there, he can look like the Colin who has gone out on a Monday night and performed well, who has gone out on a Sunday night, who has gone out in a playoff game and performed well.”\nA national audience will watch to see what tinkering did for Kaepernick over the last week when the 49ers sputter into the Meadowlands to face the Giants Sunday night. He has completed more than 60% of his passes during a 1-3 start, but one of those losses was a 47-7 defeat at the hands of the Cardinals. He was picked off four times, including back-to-back possessions when Cardinals returned the balls for touchdowns. Kaepernick will face a Giants defense that is first in the league against the run and last against the pass. Two defensive ends – Robert Ayers (hamstring) and George Selvie (calf) – have been ruled out already. All eyes will track Kaepernick as two teams heading in opposite directions collide off Exit 16W.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n“Look, nobody wants to be 32nd in anything,” Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said. “I know when the game is being called and what I’m asking the players . . . we’re playing the game to win, not to improve our stats.”\nThe same goes for the visiting quarterback.\nThis has been a season of change in the Bay Area, and much of it has been for the worse. Former coach Jim Harbaugh has the University of Michigan ranked once again, and Jim Tomsula is overseeing the current tire fire left behind. Kaepernick excelled under Harbaugh, leading the 49ers to the brink of a Super Bowl victory in New Orleans, but the QB has never returned to that level. Tomsula noted Kaepernick’s emotions are plain to see.\n“It’s on the faces,” Tomsula said. “And getting through that to let’s look at the next task and let’s get going. So, this whole week has just been full of the New York Giants.”\nKaepernick, now in his fifth season, was declared the future of the position during his Super Bowl run. He was the model quarterback, primed to throw lasers or take off for big gains on the ground. He is stuck in neutral now, unable to find the right gear.\n“This is the ebb and flow,” Chryst said, “but we have to correct that and that’s what we’ve been working on.”\nRelated Stories Bills DE Jerry Hughes hit with more than $30K in fines Giants WR Victor Cruz categorizes his status as ‘day to day’", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:11:52.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
