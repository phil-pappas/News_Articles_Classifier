When we asked her to name her favorite player, there was no hesitation. She chose Jimmy Butler . As luck would have it, Jimmy is a bit of an Erin Heatherton fan so with the NBA season about to start, it only made sense to bring the two together for a game of Truth or Dare Horse.\nErin, who grew up in Skokie, Ill. and played varsity hoops at Niles North High, was more than up to the challenge. And while she may not have won the game, her jumper sure looked sweet.\nErin can't believe she missed a shot.
