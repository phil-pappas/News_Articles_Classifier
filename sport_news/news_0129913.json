The right-hander lasted six innings before turning the game over to his bullpen, which scattered three runners over the final three frames.\nTony Sipp, Will Harris and Oliver Perez got the game to Luke Gregerson, part of Oakland's wild-card collapse in Kansas City last year. He handled the ninth to earn the save.\nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros, but they also scored via the same sort of small ball the Royals used in reaching the World Series last season.\nYordano Ventura (0-1) yielded three runs on four hits and a walk in two innings for Kansas City, but did not come back following the delay. Chris Young served up Springer's home run with one out in the fifth, but tossed four otherwise solid innings of relief.\nThe Astros, who struggled so mightily on the road this season, have apparently solved their woes just in time. They beat the Yankees 3-0 in New York in Tuesday night's wild-card game, then took care of a Royals club built specifically for spacious Kauffman Stadium.\nHouston also made it the first time since 1970 that visiting teams won baseball's first four postseason games, STATS said. The other two times it happened were 1906 and 1923.\nRANGERS 5, BLUE JAYS 3\n TORONTO — After taking a knee to the head, Josh Donaldson didn't make it to the end of Toronto's first postseason game in 22 years.\nRobinson Chirinos hit a two-run homer against David Price, Rougned Odor had a solo shot and Texas beat the Blue Jays in an AL Division Series opener.\nDonaldson left in the fifth, one inning after colliding with Odor's left knee while sliding in an attempt to break up a double play.\nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons said the slugging third baseman felt light-headed while playing defense in the fifth, forcing the AL MVP candidate to come out of the game.\nThe Rangers also lost their third baseman, Adrian Beltre, to a strained lower back. He left after hitting an RBI single in the third.\nBlue Jays outfielder Jose Bautista hit a solo homer in the sixth, then left with a sore right hamstring after popping out in the eighth. The Blue Jays said Bautista is expected to play Friday.\nPitching on 11 days' rest, Price (0-1) allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He dropped to 1-6 with a 4.79 ERA in 11 postseason games, and is 0-6 in six playoff starts.\nPrice hit Odor with pitches in consecutive plate appearances in the third and fifth, and the Rangers second baseman came around to score both times, the second time on Chirinos' homer.\nYovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings, improving to 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against Toronto.", "external_links": ["http://imgick.gulflive.com/home/gulflive-media/pgfull/img/mississippi-press/photo/2015/10/08/-58ed410e5ee3f316.jpg",
