Pulaski goes pink for Volley for the Cure Comment Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 8:18 PM By Bill Welt Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 8:18 PM MOUNT PULASKI The Mount Pulaski volleyball team covered the gym — and town — in pink for Thursday's Volley for the Cure Night at Ed Butkovich Gymnasium. The Lady Toppers will challenge Riverton beginning 6 p.m. Thursday, but it is just part of the festivities. It will also feature a pork dinner, silent auction, games and bake sale starting at 4:30 p.m. in the high school cafeteria. The proceeds will be donated to a local recipient affected by cancer. “We always do it for a local person, and people in this community go above and beyond to help out,” Mount Pulaski coach Donna Dulle said. Dulle launched the event — part of a nationwide effort — several years ago. It’s grown since then. Last year, Lucy Geyer and Shelli Ollis each received a $1,050 check from the Mount Pulaski volleyball program. “It’s always a big event for us,” Mount Pulaski senior middle hitter Lilly Pickett said. “It’s always something we look forward to. It’s exciting to have all of this stuff going on, decorating and getting ready for it. We have a lot of people who come out and support Volley for the Cure, which is great. “I feel like our community puts a lot of effort into our sports and our events. I feel we’re very blessed we have a lot of supporters out there that come participate and donate.” The Lady Toppers hope to raise $5,000 this year. “I think it’s good for players from both schools to see they can make a difference in somebody’s life,” Dulle said. But just who exactly is the recipient? That is supposed to be a surprise. “We love Volley for the Cure; I love it,” Mount Pulaski senior middle hitter Maddy Davis said. “It’s good for the community and we have fun.” Davis, Pickett and the rest of the team started to decorate the gym Wednesday. However, the Lady Toppers still have to gear up for a game. “I believe volleyball is a fun sport,” Pickett said. “It makes it more fun and more interesting to have all of this stuff going on and all of these people here. It could be a distraction in some way, but hopefully we pull through.” Davis isn’t concerned. “I think we’ll be ready tomorrow,” Davis said. Mount Pulaski (13-9 overall) lost at Pleasant Plains 2-1 on Tuesday: 17-25, 25-15 and 25-20. Page 2 of 2 - Junior setter Alexandra Beckers recorded 28 assists and five digs, while Davis had 12 kills and 10 digs. Pickett had three kills and eight digs. Despite the hiccup, Pickett said they are doing better and growing as a team. “Everyone on the court brings something we all need,” Pickett said. “We just all need each other. It’s all coming together, and I can’t wait to see what the postseason brings.” By Bill Welt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:04:08.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
