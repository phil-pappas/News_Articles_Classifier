In recent years we have donated over $100,000 to local agencies such as St. Vincent DePaul Society, Rescue Mission of the Mahoning Valley, Fairhaven School Special Olympics, Tod Children’s Hospital and Beatitude House, among others.” \nLast year, Patrick Cheptoek (29:17) was the overall winner with Shadrack Kiyai (29:33) the runner-up and Alfred Kitak (30:19) rounding out the top three finishers. \nOn the women’s side, Mary Wangesi (24th overall, 33:20) was the top female, Jane Murage (27th overall, 33:40) placed second and Keisi Nutter (39th overall, 34:33) third, 73 seconds off the pace. \nThis year’s elite list reads like a “Who’s Who” of runners and features 20 male and 14 female entries. \nMale runners to keep an eye on are Justin Dickman, Bobby Over, Scott Mate, Eric Rupe, Craig Rupe, Ceth Parker, Andy Morgan, Luke Grau, Richard Kessio, Nicholas Too, Peter Chebii, Kip Tisia, John Mirth, Samuel Malakuen, Julius Koskei, Philip Lagat, Luke Hickman, Geoffrey Kenisi, Andrew Riggins, Peter Kiprotich Kosgei and Mitchel Thornton. \nThe Peace Race will be Kosgie’s American debut, having already run a 28:27, 10k in Kenya earlier this year at altitude. \nHe also won the Standard Chartered Marathon (2:12.24) in Nairobi, Kenya last October, also at altitude and on a very hot day. \nKoskei, 33, has run three, half-marathons this year in 1:03.00 and has a personal record (28:13) in the 10k in New Orleans (2006). \nLagat, 32, hails from Kenya and has a 28:35 clocking in the 10k in 2006 in Mobile, Ala. He has also posted a 3:57.5 mile in Des Moines, Iowa (2011). \nEric and Craig Rupe, and on the women’s side Michelle, are locals, hail from a distinguished local running family, know the course and will challenge everyone from start to finish. \nWomen runners to watch include Rachel Dickman, Michelle Corkum, Jessica Odorcic, Amanda Fire, Rupe, Ro Morgan, Megan Gibson, Hellen Jepkurgat, Weynshet Ansa, Erin Webster, Minicah Ngige, Abgael Wanjiku and Samantha Hamilton. \nNgige has won six road races in the United States this year, including the Probility 5K in a blistering 15:32. Her best 10k timing (31:38) came at First Lady’s, also in Nairobi earlier this year. \nShe blazed to a sizzling 49:54 at this-year’s Cherry Blossom 10-Mile in Washington, D.C., and is the only athlete to have ever pulled off a “double” at the Crim Festival of Races, earning top-three finishes in both the mile on Friday night, and then in the 10-Mile Race on Saturday this past Aug. 21-22. \nOrganizers say she is super-fit right now and has her sights set on the course record. \nWanjiku, just 18 years old, has won two U.S. road races including the Hyde Park Blast 5K in Cincinnati and the Health Resources 8K in Cedar Rapids. \nShe was also runner-up at the Steamboat Classic 4-mile event with a time of 20:52. Her 10-K personal best (33:32) was set at high altitude in Kenya and she has run 73:34 for the half-marathon, also at altitude in Kenya. \nAnsa, also 18 and from Ethiopia, enters the weekend with a third-place finish at the 2013-IAAF World Championships in Donetsk, Ukraine as well as a fifth-place finish at the 2014-IAAF World Junior Championships in Eugene, Oregon on her ever expanding resume.
