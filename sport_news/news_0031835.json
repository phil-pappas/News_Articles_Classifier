We all always created those scenarios, like bottom of the ninth, 3-2 count, two outs … It’s always kind of creating that special atmosphere that we hopefully one day dream of being in. … I always dreamt of being in the World Series, and it still hasn’t really sunk in yet, what’s really happening. But I think walking throughout the streets of New York, like all the Mets fans, they recognize you, they give you the awesome support. And it’s just great to be a Met, great to be in New York.\nQ: What would be your dream World Series now? \nA: It doesn’t matter who the opponent is, I like our odds against anybody. I mean, I know it’s gonna be the Royals, but I think right now we’re a pretty unstoppable team. … As a starter, we’re just gonna have to get pretty deep in the game and we can hand it over to the bullpen and they’ll take care of the rest, and then hand the ball over to [Jeurys] Familia, he’s the best closer in the game, and he’s gonna come in and shut the door down.\nQ: Do you think this is a team of destiny? \nA: I came up with this scenario myself earlier this year after the D.C. series at home, we swept ’em. They had the whole trade rumors with [Wilmer] Flores and [Zack] Wheeler going to the Brewers [for Carlos Gomez], and I think after that, it came up in my head that they’re gonna come up with a “30 for 30” for us after we win the World Series. It’s gonna be called, “No Crying in Baseball.” I don’t know if it’s coincidence or what, but we’re living that right there, so I think it’s gonna be a fun series, and we’re gonna come out on top, and it’s gonna be the best feeling in the world.\nQ: Have you ever been to a World Series game? \nA: I actually went to Game 5 in 2010 when the Giants beat the Rangers to win it all. I was in Texas, the second deck in right field, literally the last row there watching the game, watching the Giants win that World Series and celebrate like they did on the field. … I can still see the picture of the dog pile in my head, what’s gonna happen. I feel really, really confident in myself and in this team that we’re gonna be able to do that here in a couple of days.\nQ: What was the atmosphere like? \nA: It was electric. The Ballpark in Arlington is huge, and having that place sold out, it was just so loud. The crowd was into it every pitch.\nDaniel Murphy Photo: Charles Wenzelberg Q: Who would you take in a fight, Superman or Daniel Murphy? \nA: Daniel Murphy with his bat? Then yeah, I would take Daniel Murphy any day. I think Daniel Murphy is Superman’s kryptonite right now.\nQ: Daniel Murphy or the original Thor? \nA: I’m still gonna go with Daniel Murphy. That guy’s unstoppable right now. It’s been a lot of fun watching him.\nQ: Favorite Daniel Murphy moment? \nA: I think, when him and [Jacob] deGrom were doing that interview together, and deGrom pushed that chair up on him, and I believe he said, “Yowzers!” He’s an unbelievable baseball player but his personality is second to none. He’s always willing to help other players. He’s very selfless out there. He’s just wanting the team to have success.\nQ: How about an on-field moment? \nA: Does it have to be in playoffs?\nQ: You have something better than the playoffs? \nA: I mean, you can always go with like the amount of home runs he’s hit in playoffs, but something that really, really stuck out to me. … We can go back to Philly when he was playing first base, and that ball kicked off [Carlos] Torres’ heel, over to Murphy, he fielded it, made a great play, Torres got over and they got the out. And just after that play had happened, the amount of emotion that Murphy exhibited was epitomizes his personality. … He just has a tremendous amount of fun out there.\nQ: What have you learned about how much New York loves a winner? \nA: [Saturday] I just walked to a juice place not too far from my apartment, I think I probably took about 10 or so pictures with people that recognized me. But I don’t mind it, I love it. The Mets have the greatest fan base, and I think the Royals, when they come into town, they’re not gonna like how loud Citi Field is.\nQ: Do you feel bad for Yankees fans? \nA: No. The Yankees had a tremendous year, they just came up a little short there, but a great ball team, and they’re gonna be a force to reckon with in the future.\nQ: But it’s a Mets town right now, isn’t it? \nA: I think it’s gonna be a Met town for a while.\nQ: How do you know that? \nA: Just the amount of youth and talent that we have here. And Sandy’s put a great ball club together, we have the staff to develop all the players we need. It’s gonna be a fun next couple of years, and I’m extremely fortunate and glad to be on that.\nNoah Syndergaard Photo: Paul J. Bereswill Q: Favorite New York City things? \nA: I’ve been exploring a little bit of New York with all its crazy foods. Have you ever heard of Queen of the Night? It’s like a Cirque du Soleil show where they serve you dinner, I actually went there last [Friday] night. The food is unbelievable. The way they serve you is, all of a sudden this crazy rock music starts being played. I don’t know what song it might have been, but it’s very intense, and they bring out like these huge planks of wood and one of them had like a Salmon Wellington on it, like the biggest rack of beef ribs you could ever imagine. You’re supposed to barter back and forth with other tables to try to get certain things. We had two ginormous chickens on our table, and there were only four people there. Have you ever heard of Sleep No more? It’s like kind of the same thing. You walk in, it’s a speakeasy, there’s a bunch of performers, you feel like you’re in the 1930s kind of thing, it’s like a Gatsby Era. It’s Macbeth-based in the 1930s. … You wear the mask and you walk through different levels of the [McKittrick] hotel, you’re free to explore whatever you want, you can follow different performers as they do their different skits.\nQ: What do you mean you wear the mask? \nA: It’s like you’re watching a movie and you’re in the movie but you’re not part of the movie.\nQ: Who are some people you would like to thank who helped get you here? \nA: First and foremost, glory to God for allowing me and blessing me to be in this situation. Couldn’t be more blessed. Secondly, my parents. They’ve been the most unbelievable support system I’ve ever had. Countless times taking me to lessons, and a lot of tears and joy going back and forth. … Unbelievable road and journey that I’ve been on going through the minor leagues and now here, being able to pitch in the World Series. Last year I was rotting away in Vegas. … I was thinking about last year, like, ‘Where was I last year?’ I was at home doing a bunch of nothing, and now I’m just having the most exciting time of my life. … My high school coach, Coach Walden, for always believing in me and giving me support. … A guy by the name of Al Davis, who played in the Phillies organization, Dodgers. He was my coach for a little bit, and he’s instilled a bunch of confidence in myself and gave me quite a bit of advice about living throughout the minor leagues, and how to handle all that adversity that could come with it. … Of course the staff here, Dan [Warthen], being able to work with him. I feel like when I made my debut and where I am now, my pitching style, pitching demeanor, everything out there is completely different. The amount of poise and the demeanor I have on the mound is completely night and day. That’s helped me tremendously, not only the mental side has helped, but he’s helped me just tremendously with new pitches and my mechanics … good old Frank Viola. That guy is almost like a second dad to me, he’s always there to pick me up when I need it, and he’s also a good friend of mine, I can always joke around and be ourselves around each other.\nQ: What is the mindset of this team? \nA: The mindset for the pitching staff is just go out there and execute one pitch at a time and win every single pitch.\nQ: But you guys are not satisfied being only National League champs, is that fair to say? \nA: Of course, yes.\nQ: What do you know about the Royals? \nA: I know that they’re a very young, scrappy team just like us. They play the game real well. They’re a lot of fun to watch as well. But I feel like we’re still gonna come out on top on this one.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under kansas city royals ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  noah syndergaard ,  serby's q&a ,  world series", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:54:47.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
