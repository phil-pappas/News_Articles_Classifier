The final eight shooters, which had three shooters each from India and Iran, saw a tough fight for medals.\nThere was disappointment in store for defending champion Pooja Ghatkar of India. Pooja shot 412.8 in qualification and started the final with an 8.9 and finally finished fifth with 143.3.\nBut the biggest shock for India was the elimination of Apurvi Chandela. She had shot 415 in the qualifiers. Apurvi, who has won medals at World Cups and World Cup finals, got off to a bad start in the finals. She hit 9.4 and 9.1 in her first three shots and after eight shots, she was the first to get eliminated with a total of 81.3. In the team event, Iran's trio of Elaheh Ahmadi Mahlagha Jambozorg and Narjes Emamgholi won gold with a total of 1247.7 while the Indian team of Apurvi, Ayonika and Pooja took silver with 1,241.4. The bronze went to South Korea (1,231.3).\nIn the junior women's 10m final too, India couldn't top the podium with Shriyanka Sadangi's bronze saving the hosts the blushes.\nIran's Najmeh Khedmati shot a world record score 208.9 in the final, but since the event didn't have the minimum participation of 10 shooters, the effort did not make the cut to be included in the record books There were only seven shooters in the event.\nIn the youth women's 10m final, Aashi Rastog shot 205.7 to clinch gold and Prachi Gadkari bagged bronze (183.6). Iran's Roya Sobhkhiz won silver with 205.5 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:56:48.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
