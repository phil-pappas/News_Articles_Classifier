It is unclear whether that person is a TSU student.\nTwo men were detained, but Silva declined to say whether they’re still being held. Police are searching for a third person.\nThe gunfire that killed Randall was preceded hours earlier by another shooting near the same housing complex. No one was believed harmed.\nOn Tuesday, university police said a shooting after a poetry slam on campus injured another man.\nAdministrators promised more patrols by campus security and university police. Houston police will also boost patrols around the campus.\nThe latest shooting generated some confusion for emergency responders because the building sits on the edge of campus, away from other structures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:27:06.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
