They now move on to the knockout round, joining three other MLS teams (L.A., D.C., and Seattle) for the first time in CCL history.\nMore Coverage Real Salt Lake secures Champions League quarterfinal berth with shutout victory Real Salt Lake 's players had a lot on their minds Tuesday as they met CSD Municipal in their final home match, and the final game of their CONCACAF Champion's League group play. A win would put them through to the knockout round. A loss would only add to the disappointment of missing out on Major League Soccer's MSL Cup tournament for the first time in seven years after losing to FC Dallas Saturday 0-1.\nThe first 30 minutes of the game lacked urgency from either team, and both seemed bothered by a slick field. The two teams looked to be waiting for the other to strike first. Real did so in the final minute of the first half when Javier Morales sent a well-targeted corner kick into the box for a wide open Jamison Olave to connect with and drive the header into the back of the net.\nReal Salt Lake didn't score a second goal during the final 45 minutes, but the first was well defended as it held Municipal to a single shot on goal in the second half, which Nick Rimando did well to parry away to keep the clean sheet and send the fans away for the season with some hope for next year.\nHere are the player grades:\nNick Rimando (GK), 10, wasn't tested as much as he might have been. Municipal made its way into the 18 plenty during the first half, it just struggled to get many shots on target. His first real test came on one of Municipal's rare shots on target when Jaime Alas uncorked one from 3 yards out in the 49th minute. His best of the night was a 76th minute blind save as Municipal's Carlos Ruiz sent a wicked bending ball over the wall on a free kick that looked bound for the upper 90. Rimando parried it over the crossbar at the last minute.\nDemar Phillips (DEF), 9 , played quality defense from his left back position. He wasn't called into the attack as much as Tony Beltran, but when he had the chance to go forward he provided quality service and did well to get back to defend against the Municipal counterattack.\nJamison Olave (DEF), 10 , appeared to be defending his Doppelganger much of the night as he marked Municipal's big, physical and fast striker, Johnny Woodly. Olave did well against the effusive Costa Rican goal-scorer. But it was in the 44th minute that he scored one of his own off a Javier Morales corner kick â€” a rather rare sight for RSL these days, but very much appreciated as it ended up being the game winner.\nAaron Maund (DEF), 9 , was steady on the back line but certainly tested by the speedy and physical Municipal attack on several occasions. He seemed caught off-guard at first, but settled in about midway through the first half and finished strong.\nTony Beltran (DEF), 10 , seemed to be the only player for RSL during the opening 15 minutes of play to show much urgency. His offensive work up the right flank was excellent all night, but especially during the first half where his efforts kept RSL in the game until the rest of the team caught up.\nLuke Mulholland (MID), 9 , used his insatiable drive to fill the midfield with defensive energy when much of the rest of the field was lacking as his teammates came up to speed through the first half. Mulholland was one of the reasons RSL weathered a lackluster start to earn the go-ahead goal at the end of the first half and maintain the momentum in the second.\nJavier Morales (MID), 10 , joined Luke Mulholland and Tony Beltran in trying to generate something of a spark throughout much of the first half. He came close to igniting a fire in the 24th minute when a well-positioned free kick went inches wide of an opening in the goal. The second half found the savvy veteran matching tit for tat with Municipal's former MLS player Carlos Ruiz as RSL outlasted Municipal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:34:16.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
