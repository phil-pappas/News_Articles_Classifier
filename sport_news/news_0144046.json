Women must feel that they have an equal chance of succeeding in football as their male counterparts. \n\"FIFA, the confederations and our member associations have to break the cycle that makes it so much easier for men to ascend to positions of responsibility. This is not just a moral duty.\" \nBlatter said there is \"compelling evidence that gender-balanced organizations make better decisions and produce better results.\" There are currently no female contenders in the race to succeed Blatter in the Feb. 26 election. \n\"Football needs more women in leadership,\" Blatter wrote. \"Those that govern the game must show now that we are all serious about answering that call.\" \nBlatter's own position has been weakened as lawyers oversee key decisions at scandal-battered FIFA and he waits to hear whether he will be suspended by the ethics committee.
