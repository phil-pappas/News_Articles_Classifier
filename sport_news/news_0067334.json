Here are the highlights: Rob McCurdy/News Journal \nGALION - Claire Reynolds proved she's no fluke Saturday afternoon at Amanns Reservoir Park. \nAfter putting up wins in the girls open race at Galion to go with invitational victories at Ontario, Buckeye Central and last week's Mid-Buckeye Conference meet, the Mansfield Christian junior won again. Reynolds wasn't pushed in her Division III girls district victory. \n\"I just ran it like I do every single race, so it wasn't difficult,\" she said. \"I felt good. In the end it hurt really bad, but overall I felt OK.\" \nReynolds clocked a 19:10 that beat her personal record by five seconds and easily topped New London freshman Gabby Osterland's 19:56 runner-up time. \n\"I just came into it wanting to do my best,\" she said. \"I didn't really have any set standards. I've run here a lot, but never PR'd here, so I wasn't sure how I'd do here.\" Buy Photo October 24th, 2015 Cross Country: District Championships at Galion Mitchell Pe Masilun/News Journal October

The defending state champion in girls Division II missed two days of school this week from sickness and was far less than 100 percent. \n\"The breathing was pretty hard today,\" she said. \"I didn't feel the greatest, but I guess it didn't go too bad in those terms.\" \nWhile Clairmonte's time was well off her PR in the low 17-minute range, her 18:08 was still 40 seconds faster than runner-up junior teammate Whitney Wendling. \n\"This is a fast course so I hoped to PR,\" Clairmonte said. \"I guess the fact that I didn't is disappointing, but I've got a couple more races. We've got Tiffin next week, which is a fast course so there are more opportunities.\" \nStricklen was almost five seconds off his best-ever time, but he didn't mind since he was running by himself most of the way around the 5K course in the D-II boys race. \n\"I didn't go out too fast, so I was able to set into a pace pretty well for the start,\" Stricklen said of his 15:22 that was 28 seconds quicker than sophomore teammate Ryan Johnston. \"I wasn't able to hold it as well as the last time I ran here at Galion, but it was four seconds off my time, so I was happy with it.\" \nThe Lexington girls romped to the team trophy scoring just 18 points as six runners finished 10th or better. Behind Clairmonte and Wendling were senior Abby Miller (third, 18:57), junior Mackenna Curtis-Collins (fourth, 19:30), sophomore Olivia Wolfe (eighth, 19:43) and senior Emily Taylor (10th, 20:03). Senior Keelie Speckert was 18th in 20:35. \nThe Lexington boys were pushed by Perkins, but won 34-38. The Minutemen got contributions from sophomore Forest Volz (fourth, 16:24), freshman Kyle Johnston (12th, 17:06), senior Bailey Stach (15th, 17:23), freshman Clay Sturts (25th, 17:48) and freshman Noah Sgambellone (29th, 18:01). \nColonel Crawford's boys easily won the D-III meet by 80 points, after scoring 28. CC juniors Brad Bauer and Nick Studer were third and fourth in 17:00 and 17:10, while senior Brandon Long was ninth in 17:33, and sophomore Wade Hopkins was 11th in 17:35. Freshman Braxton James was 52nd in 19:34, and freshman Brandon Bauer was 83rd in 21:28. \nBesides the champions, there were others that moved on to next week's regional meets, as the top four teams and runners in the top 16 earned berths. \nShelby's boys were fourth to take the final team qualifying spot in Division II, while the Shelby girls were third to move on. Sophomore Alex Moore and senior Danny Friebel were 14th and 16th for the boys in 17:16 and 17:29, while freshman Makenna Heimlich and junior Macy Lynch were 13th and 17th in 20:05 and 20:30. \nAdvancing in Division III girls to the Youngstown regional were third-place Colonel Crawford and fourth-place Bucyrus. The Eagles saw three runners finish among the top 10 with junior Anna Reffey (fifth, 20:42), junior Emily Kemper (seventh, 21:00) and sophomore Courtney Britt (10th, 21:12). The Redmen were led by senior Shaylee Campbell (12th, 21:21) and freshman Mirium Everett (13th, 21:21). Going on as an individual is Plymouth sophomore Jessica Porter who was ninth in 21:12. \nThe Eagles were the only advancing team in boys Division III, but five individuals advanced to Youngstown next week. Bucyrus junior Carson Pirnstill was sixth in 17:25 followed by Plymouth junior Nathaniel Redden in eighth in 17:33, St. Peter's freshman Luke Henrich in 12th in 17:40, Lucas freshman Gavin Shindeldecker in 13th in 17:42 and Lucas senior Connor Pollard in 14th in 17:46. \nrmccurdy@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:11:57.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
