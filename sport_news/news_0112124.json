By fuelling Iran’s aggressions with billions of dollars in sanctions relief, it makes war likely,” Netanyahu said.\n“Unleashed and unmuzzled, Iran will go on the prowl, devouring more and more prey ... You think hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief and fat contracts will turn this rapacious tiger into a kitten?”\nNetanyahu said Israel will not allow Iran “to break in, to sneak in, or to walk into the nuclear weapons club”.\n“Make sure Iran’s violations are not swept under the Persian rug. One thing I can assure you: Israel will be watching closely,” he said.\nThe Israeli prime minister painted much the same apocalyptic vision to the US Congress this year and in earlier addresses to the UN.\nBut with the Iran agreement sealed, his lengthy denunciation came across more as venting frustration than a serous shot at changing minds.\n“It’s not easy to oppose something that is embraced by the greatest powers in the world,” he acknowledged. But he added: “I refuse to be silent.”\nAfter his lengthy criticism of President Obama’s signature foreign policy achievement, Netanyahu sought to smooth the waters with the Americans.\n“Our differences about the nuclear deal are a disagreement within the family,” he said. But the US delegation sat silently during applause, most of which came from Netanyahu’s supporters who packed the gallery and clapped with unusual vigour.\nThe Israeli prime minister only got around to speaking about the Palestinians more than half an hour into his speech.\nOn Wednesday, the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, said Palestinians are no longer bound by the two decades old Oslo peace accords because Israel is not serious about the creation of an independent state out of the occupied territories.\nAbbas accused Netanyahu of imposing a form of apartheid on the West Bank and appealed for the UN to provide protection for the Palestinians.\nNetanyahu said, as he has in the past, that he is “prepared to immediately resume peace negotiations with the Palestinians without any preconditions whatsoever”, and he made a direct appeal to Abbas.\n“President Abbas, I know it’s not easy, I know it’s hard, but we owe it to our people to try, to continue to try,” he said.\nThe Palestinians say that Netanyahu’s assertion that peace talks should be “unconditional” is so that Israel can continue to expand settlements in the West Bank and effectively annex land under the cover of talks. The Palestinians want an immediate halt to settlement growth and early agreement about the borders of a state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:23:02.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
