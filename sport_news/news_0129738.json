The 37-year-old all-rounder, who retired from the game in 2009, is currently promoting his second autobiography Second Innings with a countrywide tour during which he recounted the embarrassing experience with the erectile dysfunction medication.\n\n\nAndrew Flintoff \n\"It started with an article my ex sold to the News of the World,\" Flintoff told the Daily Mail. \"It wasn't very complimentary about my 'performance', if you get my meaning. So I decided I had to put that myth to bed even though I was in the middle of a Test match.\n\"I took three Viagra one night and didn't realise how long they lasted. Trying to bat the next day in that state was not easy. I was run out, simply because I couldn't move. I could only hop. It wasn't worth it either. Complete waste of time,\" he said.\nThe former fast bowler also spoke of his initial suffering from depression during his playing days which knew nothing about it. \"I took wickets and everybody was celebrating around me and I just felt nothing, absolutely nothing. I thought I was ill. I went to the team doctor. I had no idea what was wrong. I know now. I have seen experts about it and it was a relief to be told what it was,\" said Flintoff, who still takes anti-depressants at times.\nWhile the 2005 Ashes series win has been Flintoff's top career highlight, he's had a couple of behavioural issues too en route. He got drunk and ended up taking a pedalo for a late night joyride in the Caribbean in 2007. Two years earlier, he had also got booted out of then British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office during a visit to 10 Downing Street as part of the 2005 Ashes victory celebrations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:35:24.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
