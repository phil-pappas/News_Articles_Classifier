I think there are many ways in which we can work together.\"\nCuba has perhaps the best-preserved environment in the region, particularly in coastal waters boasting populations of fish, sharks and coral in greater abundance than in other parts of the Caribbean where overfishing has largely decimated marine life. Cuba's relatively thriving marine environment is due to both strong environmental protection and a lack of economic development because of the country's struggling, centrally planned economy.\nSharks, the highest predator in many marine food chains, have been decimated by overfishing across the world. Protection of sharks and marine life is taking on increasing economic importance for Cuba as warming with the U.S. attracts a flood of tourists, many drawn to the island's spectacular diving and snorkeling sites.\nBecause many larger marine species migrate between Cuban waters and those of Mexico and the United States, American environmental groups are eager to help the island preserve its gains by bringing U.S. expertise and technology that can be used by Cuban scientists.\nThe shark plan commits Cuba to providing fisherman with training in identifying sharks and recording shark catches, then places limits on the size and number of sharks that Cuban fisherman can catch, and where they can catch them.\nThe Environmental Defense Fund is signing a memorandum of understanding with Cuba this week that envisions bringing American scientists to Cuba for at least three years to help researchers here to help put the new shark protection plan into effect.\n\"The environment is the lowest-hanging fruit,\" said Daniel Whittle, the Environmental Defense Fund's senior director for Cuba. \"It's in our national interest when Cuba protects its resources.\"\n____\nMichael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mweissenstein"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:14:55.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
