Many players will wear pink arm sleeves, pink arm bands, or pink socks. In the Mingus Union High School gym on Tuesday it was a Pink Out as the Mingus Volleyball team decided to support the survivors and the fighters of breast cancer. Decked out in special pink jerseys for the occasion the Marauders took on the #16 Northland Prep Spartans. As they always do the Mingus Marauders fought till the very end. Unfortunately they came out on the losing end, losing three straight games to a tough Spartans team. The Marauders jumped out to a quick lead in the first game, jumping ahead of the Spartans 5-0. The quick spurt of points was powered by two aces from senior Ailyn Perez, who also contributed a kill to the rally. Junior Quin Thompson scored the other two points for the Marauders with a kill and a block to start off the first game. Thompson had another kill after a brief Spartan rally to put the score at 6-3. After a Kaylee Gordon ace, the Marauders committed two errors that put the score at 10-6. The Spartans answered with a kill before Junior Kiana Kreiner put one down to make it 11-7. Kreiner came up huge on the next rally for the Marauders as she made two saves that kept it alive, one dig came by the use of her knuckles. Gordon finished the rally with a kill that put the Marauders up 12-7. After a Mingus block made it 15-10, the Spartans went on a run that brought the score to 16-14. A Mingus ace put the Marauders up 17-14. A hit that landed out of bounds gave the Spartans an opportunity and they took advantage. A kill by junior outside hitter Megan Netherton brought the Spartans within one. The Spartans aced on their next serve and the game was tied. The two teams traded points until it was tied again at 20-20 and then the Spartans cruised two victory. After two straight kills, the Spartans didn't look back and took the first game 20-25. The Marauders went on to drop the next two games 12-25 in both, as the Spartans took home the victory. On Wednesday the Marauders traveled to Saguaro to take on the Division II Sabercats. The Sabercats are ranked at 21 in the Division II AIA rankings.
