HUNT App users can turn their smartphone, iPad, or GPS unit into a multi-layered map which shows public and private property boundaries, hunting unit boundaries, and landowner contact information – all layered over aerial imagery or topographic base maps. Users entering the promo code PF15 when purchasing the application support the wildlife habitat conservation efforts of Pheasants Forever with a $15 donation. \n“The HUNT App created by onXmaps is providing upland bird hunters with increased access opportunities on public and private lands,” said Brad Heidel, director of corporate sales for Pheasants Forever. “Having to buy countless hunting atlases and plat maps in multiple states is expensive and inefficient for the diehard upland hunter. Instead, we encourage our members and followers to purchase the HUNT App by onXmaps – readily available hunting access data which also supports Pheasants Forever’s habitat mission.” \nAbout onXmaps: \nA trusted source for private and public land ownership mapping technology, onXmaps has been a leader in data collection and mapping since 2008. \nVisit onXmaps at www.huntingGPSmaps.com . \nAbout Pheasants Forever: \nPheasants Forever, including its quail conservation division, Quail Forever, is the nation’s largest nonprofit organization dedicated to upland habitat conservation.
