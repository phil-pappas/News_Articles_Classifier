Connecticut psychologist Stuart Vyse, author of Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition, said personal rituals will continue as long as baseball is being played.\n“One of the characteristics in baseball that makes it a hotbed for superstition is there is a lot of waiting time. Basketball players, for example, don’t have as many superstitions they can exercise in the course of a game, because the game is rapid and they’re not standing still. Baseball allows players to fill that time as a way of defeating anxiety and do one more thing to bring on the desired result.”\nSome players even take their superstitions past the ninth inning because “you attempt to keep the environment the way it was when you had success,” which is why not washing clothes or lucky underwear or other totems are given special significance.\nThere are psychological positives in believing in superstitions, especially in a high-stakes event such as a baseball championship where careers and salaries are on the line, Vyse said, because it may make them perform better.\nBlue Jays fans have their own rituals as to not jinx the team:\n“I’ll rub (the statue of) Ted Rogers’ foot” outside Rogers Centre, Anthony Salemi, 30 , said. “It started the last few years and it happened organically. When I did it, they beat the (Tampa Bay) Rays. I got it from the old Eaton’s statue, they used to rub Timothy Eaton’s foot for good luck. Ted Rogers has saved the team. Without him, we wouldn’t have baseball to begin with.” “I try to not be superstitious, but I feel like I secretly am,” said Ryan Fujiki, 30 . “I bought a brand new Jays hat and they have lost when I have worn it. Now I just wear my old one and will continue to wear it because they seem to win when I have it with me or when I wear it.” “I have a necklace with a baseball charm, a blue stone heart, and white beads on it. You’d think it would be lucky for the Jays, right?” said Rebecca Johnson, 31 . “Well, I wore it games one and two, they lose. Don’t wear it games three and four, they win. I am never wearing the necklace during a game again!” SOME BASEBALL RITUALS AND SUPERSTITIONS:\nNot talking to the pitcher in the dugout during a no-hitter game because that could jinx it. Jays slugger Edwin Encarnacion does his ‘Edwing’ homerun walk where he sticks out his bent right arm as he rounds the bases. He said it’s not a superstition, but rather a ritual. Fans have since Photoshopped a blue jay bird on his arm in memes. Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander’s ritual was eating three crunchy taco supremes (no tomato), a cheesy gordita crunch and a Mexican pizza (also no tomato) from Taco Bell before a game. Boston Red Sox players all grew beards in the 2013 season to symbolize “worst-to-first” — to bring on a winning season. Jays pitcher R.A. Dickey, when he played for the New York Mets, reportedly gave interesting monikers to each of his bats — such as Orchrist the Goblin King from The Hobbit and Hrunting from Beowulf. Pitchers usually don’t shave on game day. New York Yankees’ great Joe DiMaggio and others always stepped on second base on their way in from centre field. jenny.yuen@sunmedia.ca .\nRituals and superstitions part of baseball\nBy Jenny Yuen , Toronto Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 12:24 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 04:05 PM EDT\nIt may not involve a black cat or walking under a ladder, but the game of baseball has a long-standing history of superstition.
