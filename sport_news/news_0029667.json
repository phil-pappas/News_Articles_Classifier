Sri Lanka lost four wickets in the face of an inspired bowling performance from West Indies but still managed to stretch their lead to 202 on the third day of the second and final test on Saturday. \nThe hosts, who won the opening test in Galle by an innings and six runs, reached 165-6 at lunch to build on their first-innings lead of 37. \nKusal Perera's dismissal by part-time off-spinner Kraigg Brathwaite (five) prompted lunch to be taken, with captain Angelo Mathews on 31 at the other end. \nResuming on 76-2, Sri Lanka were pegged back early when they lost two wickets in three deliveries, with both overnight batsmen getting out. \nOpener Kaushal Silva (32) was the first to fall when he edged debutant spinner Jomel Warrican to slip, and two balls later paceman Jerome Taylor forced a nick from Dinesh Chandimal (12) for wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin to complete a smart catch. \nMathews and Milinda Siriwardana (42), Sri Lanka's top-scorer from the first innings, added 67 for the fifth wicket to steady the innings and took the team's lead closer to the 200-run mark. \nWith Marlon Samuels' bowling action under a cloud after he was reported for the third time in his career, West Indies captain Jason Holder called on Brathwaite to break the stand. \nThe bowler responded brilliantly, sending back Siriwardana in his second over before enjoying more success with the first delivery of his next over when Kusal Perera got an under edge for Ramdin to hold on to another good catch. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:55:59.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
