After blowing their fourth fourth-quarter lead of the season in Sunday’s stunning 27-23 home loss to Carolina , they fell to a more stunning 2-4 record.\nAdChoices It's time to face a harsh reality. The Seahawks aren't just in danger of not making the playoffs: The door might already be closed.\nMORE: NFL Week 6 photos | Panthers, in final seconds, finally overcome Seahawks\nThe two-time defending NFC champions are just a few minutes short of being 6-0, but that record belongs to the Panthers and Packers, the two best teams in the NFL this season.\nForget chasing the No. 1 seed or having the road to the Super Bowl go through the intimidating “12th Man.” It’s the 11 men on offense and defense Seattle needs to worry about the most.\nWhen the Seahawks were slow out of the gate, losing at St. Louis and Green Bay, pundits chalked it up to Kam Chancellor's absence on defense. All looked right in the world when he finally arrived and the Seahawks shut down Chicago and Detroit, two bad NFC teams.\nBut then the level of competition was raised, first to undefeated Cincinnati and now still-undefeated Carolina. Weird to say, but Seattle simply wasn’t the tougher team in final 15 minutes of either game, mentally or physically.\nThe Seahawks do play with plenty of emotion, charged up by guys like Chancellor and cornerback Richard Sherman. But that play style has come with a lack of communication that's led to blowing coverage assignments and allowing big plays. You can fault the entire “The Legion of Boom” for that: the players, defensive coordinator Kris Richard and coach Pete Carroll.\nThe offense hasn’t done any favors either. It can't run the ball well, sustain drives or whittle the clock in crunch time. While Andy Dalton and Cam Newton both led comebacks standing upright and making big throws, Russell Wilson has been left scrambling, trying to survive playing backyard football.\nDoes Seattle really have a Super Bowl hangover? It's a fair question, given they couldn't close that one game against the Patriots in February:\nThat one-yard mistake in the Super Bowl has turned into a mile-wide difference in play in the fourth quarter against guys like Rodgers, Dalton and Newton. Wilson meanwhile, fresh off his big new contract, hasn’t elevated his play as much as they’ve needed.\nMORE: NFL Top Week 6 performances | Josh Norman showing up Richard Sherman\nThat still doesn’t explain how the defense has been overwhelmed while facing opponents with one-dimensional comeback game plans. That should play into Seattle's hands as a strong pass rushing team with a secondary built to clean up. We’ve become used to knowing that putting up 24 and 23 points, like the Seattle offense's last two outings, should be more than enough for the Seahawks.\nNewton made a great throw for the 26-yard game-winning touchdown to Greg Olsen, but it was shocking to see how easily the go-to tight end got behind the defense. It left Sherman and Chancellor shaking their heads, lost for answers.\nIt’s disturbing that these plays come when the offense is starting to find some early mojo, notably in its run game and with more deep passes to Jimmy Graham.\nThey are losing the battles in front of Wilson — who’s on pace to take 69 sacks after the Panthers dropped him four times — and it’s affecting the defense. The frustration is complementary, leading to the most volatile of mixes.\nThe Seahawks aren’t completely dead, because of two things. They should know one of the NFC wild-card berths is completely up for grabs. They should also see they’re still only two games behind Arizona in the West, with two games still to play against the Cardinals. They should know that added up to the division title last season. And, most importantly, six of their final 10 opponents, like them, also have current sub-.500 records.\nBut these Seahawks are about the big picture, not just finishing ahead of the Cardinals again. That possibility looks bleak, especially as they have to at least beat Carolina and Green Bay again, this time far away from Seattle.\nRight now, they just need to worry about every game to avoiding completely fading from the playoff picture.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658625-nfl-week-6-top-performers-fantasy-matt-stafford-deandre-hopkins-cameron-wake", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-18/cam-newton-panthers-undefeated-seahawks-recap-stats-highlights", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658345-nfl-week-6-photos-pictures-falcons-saints-julio-jones-michael-mauti-mark-ingram", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-15/josh-norman-vs-richard-sherman-elite-cornerbacks-panthers-seahawks-week-6", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-18/panthers-seahawks-cam-newton-greg-olson", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:49:43.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
