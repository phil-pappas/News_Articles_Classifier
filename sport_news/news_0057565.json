(AP) - Every Thursday night, DeMarcus Ware pours himself a glass of 1982 Gruaud Larose, a red Bordeaux from his birth year, to enjoy with a nice Porterhouse steak. \n“It’s pretty expensive,” Ware said. “And it tastes good.” \nIt’s both a toast to his reunion with Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips and a cheat day on his diet that has him down to 245 pounds. That’s 20 pounds lighter than when he was with Phillips in Dallas. \nWith an NFL-best 4 1-2 sacks, Ware is the leader of Denver’s sacks brigade that’s wrangled 18 sacks so far, putting the unbeaten Broncos (4-0) on pace to tie the NFL record of 72 set by the 1984 Chicago Bears. \nThe 68-year-old Phillips has turned loose a defense loaded with five Pro Bowlers that’s produced 11 takeaways and bought Peyton Manning and Gary Kubiak more time to tune up a hybrid offense that’s more fuel efficient than high octane. \n“Some coaches send the kitchen sink at you where you have to think so much before every play, but he makes it simple for us,” Ware said. \n“So, now you can read your keys a lot more, you can study a lot more film, you can figure out how they’re going to attack you. So, no matter what defense we run, we know how they’re going to attack us and we can be aggressive.” \nPhillips’ predecessor, Jack Del Rio, now head coach of the Raiders (2-2), whom the Broncos play Sunday, wasn’t this aggressive with largely the same personnel last year, when Ware had one sack over his last seven games. \n“They’re playing really well together, a lot of confidence,” Del Rio said. “… The last three years we played some great ball there. (I’ve) got some great memories of us playing really well. They’ve taken that to a whole other level.” \n“Wade just puts the best players in position to do what they do best,” defensive end Antonio Smith said. “And when you do that and you’re successful at it, it just makes it fun. And when playing defense is fun, you’ll be playing harder than you ever knew you could play by accident than you ever have on purpose.” \nThis group is sure having a blast. \nReturning to the 3-4 defense under Phillips, who helped him average 16 sacks in their four years together with the Cowboys, a rejuvenated Ware is playing like a man much younger than 33. \nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Ware also leads the NFL with 25 quarterback pressures (sacks, hits and hurries), one ahead of teammate Von Miller. \nThe two have even lined up over center at times, but Ware said he’s not sure if the snapper is ever surprised when he looks up. \n“Hopefully by the time he picks his head up the ball is snapped and I’m past him,” Ware said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:55:15.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
