We've already had some shocks results and some breakout stars, but who has impressed the most? Here's my starting XI of the Barclay's Premier League team of the season...so far. \nGoalkeeper – Hart \nThere’s been a lot of talk this season over who sits behind Manuel Neuer as the second best goalkeeper in the world. Although many names have been thrown into the ring I feel that Joe Hart definitely deserves a shout and his performances this season prove this. He has sat out one game this season due to injury and Man City clearly missed him as they lost 4-1 to Spurs. He has also played in England’s European Qualifiers this season and hasn’t conceded a goal. \nDefender – Kompany \nKompany was injured for most of last season and Manchester City really missed him. He’s a rock at the back and their captain. Manchester City are sitting pretty at the top of the table Kompany is clearly a big part of that. He has made 5 appearances this season and scored two goals, including one against West Brom. \nDefender – Stones \nThis year John Stones has really shows that he’s worth the money that Chelsea were willing to pay for him in the summer transfer window. After a consistent start to the season that has seen him help Everton to 7th in the table and a 1-1 draw in the Merseyside derby. \nDefender – Alderweireld \nSpurs have struggled this season. They aren’t as free scoring as they seemed last season, largely down to Harry Kane losing his shooting boots. However there are two positives that they can take from this season. The first is that they are still in 8th, just behind Everton on goals scored, and they have a much more solid defence than last season. For me, this is largely down to the Belgian Toby Alderweireld. He has formed a great partnership with Jan Vertonghen and has even chipped in with a goal. \nDefender – Kolarov \nThe Serbian was a bit of a dark horse at the start of the season. Last season he struggled to hold down a starting place, eventually losing it to Gael Clichy. However now he’s firmly locked it down after a string of great performances. He has also provided going forward, netting a goal and getting several assists. \nMidfielder – Mahrez \nBy far the biggest surprise of the season, Riyad Mahrez has helped Leicester continue there fantastic form from the end of last season despite changing manager Mahrez has scored five goals and earned three assists as well. He has put in many match winning performances that have please many a fantasy football fan and that's why he makes it into my BPL team of the season. \nMidfielder – Payet \nThe Payet > Ozil debated turned the Internet into a war zone earlier in the year, but after the his performances this season Payet beat the German to my BPL team of the season. He's been pulling all the strings midfield for West Ham and is almost guaranteed to at least score or assist in each game. \nMidfielder – Sanchez \nSanchez has been fantastic this season and is a big reason why Arsenal are so close to the summit of the table. He scored a hat-trick against Leicester and was their star man in their 3-0 domination of Manchester United. \nMidfielder – Mata \nMata showed glimpses of the brilliance he possesses last season, most notably his goal against Liverpool at Anfield. However he has been showing that form much more consistently this season, finding the back of the net three times and assisting his teammates three times too. He's just the kind of player Chelsea could use right about now. \nStriker – Vardy \nWith Leicester sitting so highly on the table it felt wrong giving all the credit to Mahrez. Jamie Vardy was playing in the conference divisions as little as a few years ago and now he's scoring for fun. Much like Mata he showed glimpses of what he can do last season but this time around he is proving to be very dominant, scoring seven times in eight appearances. \nStriker – Mane \nManè has played in a few positions this season but I've put him up front because I wanted to put him in but he wouldn't fit into the midfield. He has managed two goals and four assists so far this season so in my time he would be the one providing Vardy.
