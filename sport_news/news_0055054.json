(Tim Geer / LEHIGH SPORTS INFORMATION) Keith Groller Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call \nBRONX, N.Y. â€” Andy Coen was frustrated. \nHe was mad at the self-inflicted wounds made by his Lehigh football team. \nHe wasn't thrilled with the officiating. \nAnd he wasn't delighted by the vast number of big plays surrendered by his defense, particularly to Chase Edmonds. \nBut most of all, he was angry because his team missed an opportunity to beat the No. 10 team in FCS football and the defending Patriot League champion on Saturday at Fordham's Jack Coffey Field. \nLehigh fell to the Rams 59-42 and Edmonds had an amazing second half, rushing for 242 of his school and league-record 347 yards after halftime. Edmonds accounted for four touchdowns and 404 yards of offense. \nYet, Lehigh headed westbound over the George Washington Bridge early Saturday night wondering what might have been. \nObliterated by all of the yards (1,036), points (101) and touchdowns (14) was the fact that the Mountain Hawks led 21-17 at halftime and were still within 10 when they missed a 35-yard field goal with 2:35 to play. \n\"Fordham's an outstanding program with a lot of talent and a great coach and they do a great job, but they were a beatable football team today and we just didn't get it done,\" Coen said. \nLehigh couldn't get it done because they lost starting quarterback Nick Shafnisky to a hip-pointer in the second quarter, but also because of five turnovers, including an interception that was run back for a touchdown, and nine penalties for 90 yards. There was a myriad of other miscues that plagued a young team still trying to find its identity. \n\"I was very pleased with the guys' effort and how they competed, but we're still our own worst enemy,\" said Coen, who saw his team fall to 3-4, 1-1 in the Patriot League. \"Too many penalties, too many turnovers and if you keep turning the ball over more than the other team, it's hard to win games, especially in a league like ours where everything is very, very competitive.\" \nThe positive was Lehigh kept fighting through the adversity; both the kind that was self-inflicted and also the kind caused by a potent Fordham offense that racked up 545 yards and averaged 8.3 yard per play. \nShafnisky, the junior from Whitehall, engineered touchdown-producing drives on three of his five possessions before going out with an injury. He finished 7-for-11 passing for 138 yards and a touchdown and ran for another 30 yards and another score. \nHe was injured on his run into the end zone on a two-point conversion, another play that angered Coen. \nBrad Mayes, a highly touted freshman from Tampa, Fla., came on to replace Shafnisky and overcame a shaky start that featured an interception on his second throw to finish with 205 passing yards and two touchdowns. \n\"When Nick went down, I felt the energy went down on the sideline,\" Coen said. \"But the kids rallied around Brad and got past that.\" \n\"I wish Nick the best of luck and hope he gets healthy and he's back next week,\" Mayes said. \"You hate to see one of your best friends go down. Being a freshman in my first game, I had some jitters at first. But once I got over that, I was able to play football. I just wanted to get in rhythm and make plays.\" \nCoen admitted that Lehigh got a little conservative with Mayes in there, and the running threat from the quarterback position was minimized because Mayes is more of a pocket passer who runs to escape rather than by design. \n\"He did a great job for being stuck in that situation,\" Coen said. \"It's tough to have to rally the guys when you get so far down, but he did.\" \nMayes completed 16 of 38 passes for 205 yards and two TD passes to Sasha Kelsey, but there were three picks including the one that was returned 23 yards for a touchdown by Jihaad Pretlow that made it 52-28 with 12:52 left. \nStill, Mayes and Lehigh kept battling. Mayes shook off the pick-six to throw his two TD passes and Lehigh drove to the Fordham 18 with 2:35 left with a chance to make it a one-score game. That's when Ed Mish's 35-yard field goal try hit off the left upright and bounced back. \n\"That was just one of those things; it was that kind of a day,\" Coen said. \nAnd then Edmonds put the game away and himself into the record books with a 75-yard dash to the end zone that put the punctuation mark on it for the Rams, who are now 7-1 and 3-0 in the league. \n\"We've got a lot of young guys out there and they're competing like heck,\" Coen said. \"Sometimes it takes a little seasoning and I want it to happen now. We all want it to happen now. \n\"We've got just a month of football left and I think we can still be playing for a championship. But we have to get better, though. No one's going to hand it to us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:16:50.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
