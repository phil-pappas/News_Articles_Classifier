Veteran left tackle Joe Thomas thoroughly dismissed the allegations contained therein, comparing it to the kind of tongue-in-cheek satire found in a typical article from “The Onion.”\nAdChoices The report, in which several anonymous Browns players were Quote: d, alleged that offensive starters were incredulous over the fact that Josh McCown was reinserted into the starting lineup for the team’s tilt against the Oakland Raiders after a winning performance by Johnny Manziel the previous week.\nBrowns wide receiver Andrew Hawkins came forward on social media to rip the story, calling it “ 1000 percent made up .” Now Thomas has come forward to dispute the allegations.\n\"It’s funny because the first thing I [thought] about this article, it reminded me of being in college and picking up The Onion , when you’d start reading this outrageous article and wonder who made it up,” Thomas said in a radio interview, as transcribed by Pro Football Talk.\nThomas then went on to slam TMZ’s credentials as a legitimate news organization.\n“[The report] couldn’t be further from the truth,” he continued. “It really belongs more in The Onion than a reputable news source, if that’s what we’re gong to call TMZ. I’d be shocked if they really found three starters who were behind those Quote: s.”\nMcCown put up an underwhelming performance in his first game back since suffering a concussion in a Week 1 showdown with the New York Jets, going 28-for-49 for 341 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in a 27-20 loss. Thomas suspects the perceived discontent with the starting quarterback position stems from losing and the current lack of a certifiable franchise quarterback.\nThomas at times has been critical of Manziel but has also come to his defense , especially in the wake of the second-year quarterback’s stint in rehab, so it’s not as if he’s biased one way or the other. It’s more a case of him trying to quiet yet another burgeoning controversy in the Browns locker room.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeRALu.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeWdGq.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Browns", "https://twitter.com/Hawk/status/648846864436064257", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2015/04/06/joe-thomas-johnny-manziel-needs-to-regain-trust-of-browns/", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/09/29/cleveland-browns-players-furious-over-johnny-manziel-put-him-in-the-damn-game/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeVMfY.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Raiders", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2015/04/15/browns-teammates-address-johnny-manziel-situation-at-uniform-unveiling/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeVRGc.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/BKQ29B/MSN-Prime&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Manziel", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/09/29/joe-thomas-compares-tmz-browns-story-to-the-onion-says-drama-comes-with-losing/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:04:25.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
