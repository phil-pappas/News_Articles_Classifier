(And this is why \"Star Wars\" nerds can't have nice things.)\nUpdate: It looks like at least one both of the Instagram videos featuring new footage has suddenly disappeared like Alderaan.\nRepost @starwarsarchive || Leaked footage from the new trailer?\nA video posted by Star Wars VII™ (@starwars_vii) on Oct 18, 2015 at 10:19am PDT\nRepost @starwarsarchive || Leaked footage from the new trailer?\nA video posted by Star Wars VII™ (@starwars_vii) on Oct 18, 2015 at 10:19am PDT\nUpdate 2: Here's a better look at one of the trailers for the trailer (this is getting nutty).\nUpdate 3: Here are more scenes: The Resistance gathers tomorrow.
