The unseeded Indian beat the world No. 2 Marin 21-15 18-21 21-17 in a closely-fought semifinal that lasted one hour and 14 minutes. This was the 20-year-old Hyderabadi’s first win over Marin in their last four outings. Sindhu, a two-time bronze medallist at the World Championships, will now take on former world No. 1 and reigning Olympics champion Li Xuerui of China in the final of the $650,000 Super Series Premier event tomorrow. Fourth seed Xuerui beat Korean seventh seed Sung Ji Hyun 21-8 20-22 21-10 in the other semifinal. Sindhu had never gone past the semifinals in the Super Series or Super Series Premier events. In the quarterfinals, Sindhu had beaten former world No. 1 Wang Yihan in straight games. Sindhu had lost to Wang — the 2011 World Championships winner and silver medallist at the 2012 London Olympics — four times in the past. But the Indian dished out a stunning performance to post a 21-18 21-19 win over the sixth-seeded Chinese. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:03:01.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
