Next week, I think we'll be able to say 'this team is really good.' Last year when Bay played here I said, 'those guys are going to be in a state championship.' \" \nAnd the Yellowjackets won the state championship, giving them three in the past five seasons. \n\"If Valley Springs would have come for another game, we probably would've matched them up with Bay again this year,\" Hulse said. \"Not many people want to play Valley Springs' girls though.\" \nBay and Jasper meet in both girls' and boys' action, beginning at 4 p.m. Tuesday. Norfork's girls are scheduled to face the Valley Springs Lady Tigers at 6:30 p.m., with the Panthers and Tigers meeting right after. \nNorfork's boys defeated Flippin 86-41 in a preseason benefit game on Friday night at Norfork. \n\"Our senior boys looked good the other night,\" Hulse said. \"You never know this early in the season. I know (Flippin coach) Dion (Hargrove) enough to know he'll bring them around. Valley Springs girls are going to be tops in the state. I don't know how Valley boys will be. I'm sure they'll be competitive.\" \nThe Lady Panthers fell in an overtime battle in their preseason game against Flippin, Norfork is without one of its top players in forward Kelcy Acklin. \n\"The Norfork-Valley games will be good,\" Hulse said. \"We have one of our best girls out for the season. That was a big blow to us. We still have some good girls, they're just going to have to regroup. (Acklin has) been a starter for us since the ninth grade. (Sophomore Marleigh) Dodson had a really good game against Flippin the other night. I think (Tuesday) night has some really good matchups. I'm really looking forward to Norfork and Valley boys.\" \nValley Springs and several other teams in the Classic also will be making a trip to Brockwell for Izard County's Bad Boy Mowers Classic. Most teams in Norfork's annual event, however, will be making at least two trips. \n\"Valley's only coming over once. They used to play twice,\" Hulse said. \"I know (Izard County) has one going on the same time as we do, and there are a few of our teams that play one over there, too. Lead Hill, Viola, Calico and Cotter boys have a game over there.\" \nCalico Rock and Omaha meet in girls' and boys' action on Wednesday, with Bergman and Alpena also meeting in the later two contests. \n\"Omaha, last year was their first year to come over here,\" Hulse said. \"I think just about everyone who's on here has been here before. Bruno-Pyatt hasn't been here in a while, but they're coming back. They have Bobby Howard coaching there, and they'll be playing Saturday.\" \nNorfork's girls play their second of three games at the Classic on Thursday, while Cotter's boys make the trip to face Lead Hill in the late game. Southside-Bee Branch's girls and boys will be playing back-to-back nights at the event, starting with the 4 p.m. game Thursday. \n\"It scatters them out pretty good,\" Hulse said of the Lady Panthers having a day of rest between each of their three games. \"Our boys will play Tuesday and Saturday.\" \nBay returns on Friday night to face Flippin in both boys' and girls' play, while Southside-Bee Branch faces Jasper in the first two games. \nSaturday's slate features six games, beginning at 1 p.m. Norfork's Lady Panthers face Bruno-Pyatt in their third game at the event. Cotter's boys battle Bruno-Pyatt, Calico Rock faces Alpena in each school's second appearance in the Classic, and the host teams wrap up the event by taking on Concord. The Pirates won the 1A state title just two seasons ago. \n\"Concord usually comes up with a pretty good team. They came last year,\" Hulse said. \"I tried to get them up here the year they won the state championship. They were filled up, though. They're a basketball school, just like most of these on here are.\" \nAdmission is $4 for adults and $3 for students. \n\"We have a great concession stand,\" Hulse said. \"There's going to be five days of really good high school basketball, boys and girls. If you want to see some good basketball, come on down to Pantherland.\" \nFor local sports updates, follow Neal Denton on Twitter @BBSportsNeal and Like his Facebook page at facebook.com/BBSportsNeal 3 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/sports/2015/10/19/tr-classic-tips-off-basketball-season/74227490/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:51:45.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
