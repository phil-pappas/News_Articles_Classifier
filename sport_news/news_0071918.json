USC visits Notre Dame on Sunday. \nHaden wasn't specific about the reasons for Sarkisian's absence, only saying the second-year coach is \"not healthy.\" \nSarkisian publicly apologized before the season after he showed up drunk at a pep rally and made a slurred public statement. \nSarkisian is 12-6 leading the talented Trojans, who lost 17-12 to unranked Washington last Thursday. \nHelton is in his second stint as USC's interim coach. He led the Trojans to a Las Vegas Bowl victory in 2013. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Â© 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
