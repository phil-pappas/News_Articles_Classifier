According to the latest crop report, progress is in line with an average year and ahead of last year’s pace. But timing is only one factor to consider. \nWith trucks hauling grain to the elevator just outside of town, workers at Beadle's Auto Group in Bowdle know farmers’ income means a lot to all of them. \n\"Well it's real important, you know. When the farmers are making hay, so are we so to speak. When they're having a good year, typically so are we,\" sales representative Jon Brockel said. \nThat’s often true for tax revenue in South Dakota, as well. The state adjusted revenue numbers down when agriculture sales dropped along with crop prices. \nAt North Central Farmers Elevator in Ipswich, grain merchandiser Kyle Bowman says this year's grain prices aren't the best, but could be worse. \n\"They're down, maybe if you're looking at a 5-8 year average but up higher than last year definitely. I know corn is like 60 cents higher than this time last year,\" Bowman said. \nThe break-even point will vary from farm to farm, but some farmers will bring in more money than they expected they could with current crop prices. Yields are high in much of the state. \n\"It's hard to say for each individual farmer, but I'd say they're going to be OK this year, make it through this year and the big yields are definitely helping,\" Bowman said. \nIn fact, agriculture officials are expecting a record bean harvest, Bowman said. \nThere's no saying exactly what farmers will be free to spend come the end of the year, but in a rural community Brockel says a lot rides on that. If more customers buy vehicles, he can make and spend more money, too. \n\"When money's a little better, you do a little more of the fun stuff and the kids get a few more treats at Christmas time or whatever,\" Brockel said. \nEach of those purchases adds to tax revenue for the state as well. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
