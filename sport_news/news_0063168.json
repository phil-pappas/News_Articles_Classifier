I know my teammates do, as well, and our coaching staff. This is part of it. You've got to be able to live in the moment.\" \nFour Kansas City pitchers combined for a three-hitter in Game 1, silencing Toronto's powerful bats. Salvador Perez hit a solo homer and Alcides Escobar went 2-for-3 with two runs scored and one RBI for the Royals, who won their eighth consecutive ALCS contest - two off the major-league record set by the Baltimore Orioles from 1969-73.TV: 4:07 p.m. ET, FS1, RSN (Toronto)PITCHING MATCHUP: Blue Jays LH David Price (1-1, 7.20 ERA) vs. Royals RH Yordano Ventura (0-1, 7.71) \nPrice picked up a victory in relief in Game 4 of the AL Division Series against Texas despite surrendering three runs and six hits over three innings. He served up two homers in his one start versus the Rangers after allowing just four in 11 regular-season turns with the Blue Jays. Price is 2-0 with a 1.93 ERA in six career appearances (five starts) against Kansas City, including a 1-0 mark and 2.93 ERA in two 2015 starts. \nThe 24-year-old Ventura is making his third start this postseason and the seventh of his career as manager Ned Yost feels he has found his comfort zone. \n\"I don't think he's gotten any better in terms of his talent, but as a professional and as a competitor, he's gotten a lot better,\" Yost said. \"He's matured a lot, which is a good thing. Young guys go through some tough times up here. And the more you endure it, the more you learn from it, the better off you're going to be.\" \nVentura is 1-0 with a 3.75 ERA in two career starts against Toronto, with the win coming this season despite allowing five runs and six hits in seven innings.WALK-OFFS1.
