LM Otero, AP Summary \nAn Arizona resident who signed with the Red Rocks last fall will represent Team USA in Scotland. \nMyKayla Skinner, the Gilbert, Arizona, gymnast who signed with the University of Utah last fall but deferred enrollment as she makes a run at the 2016 Summer Olympics, is on her way to Glasgow, Scotland, to represent Team USA at the World Championships. \nThe team left for Scotland on Wednesday and will begin competing Oct. 24, according to a news release from Utah Athletics. This will be Skinner's second World Championships. In 2015, she took third on vault and fourth on floor as Team USA won gold in China. \nSkinner was named to the team Oct. 8. \n“We are really excited for MyKayla,” said Utah co-head coach Tom Farden in the release. “This is another great opportunity for her to compete against the world’s best gymnasts on an international stage. We look forward to watching both MyKayla's and Team USA’s success in Scotland.” Ryan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com . Follow him on Twitter @ryanwmcdonald.
