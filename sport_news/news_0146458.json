Freshman quarterback Prince Dukes hooked up with wideout Wesley Foryoh for a 40-yard touchdown, running back Shaquan Coles had a 44-yard touchdown run and defensive back Adebowale Godwin returned an interception 36 yards for a score to account for the Warriors' points.\nCoach Peter Gambardella praised his defense.\n\"There's no Timmons, no Easley out here. It's one unit and that's the way they've been playing,\" Gambardella said.\nGodwin said limiting a physical running team like Flushing to only four first downs - two of which Curtis aided to due to penalties - was the statement his Warriors needed to make.\n\"That was the statement,\" Godwin said. \"They always said we were good, but not elite and we have to show them we are elite.\"\nIt didn't take long for Curtis (7-3) to expose Flushing as team that couldn't string together a passing game.\nWhen Curtis took away Flushing's run, the Red Devils knew they were in trouble.\n\"They played so much better than us up front,\" Flushing coach James DeSantis said. \"We didn't block. That's it.\"\nFlushing hurt itself with several offside penalties early and allowing Curtis to extend its drives on fourth downs.\nThe Red Devils (5-5) were never truly able to gain momentum. Running back Andrew King's 30-yard TD rush with 2:15 left came too late.\nDukes found Foryoh for a score to put Curtis up 6-0 with 2:38 remaining in the first quarter and Coles followed on the Warriors' next possession, finding a hole for his long TD run.\n\"That was my first break,\" said Coles, who has been hampered by an injured hamstring for much of the season. \"When I broke it, I didn't know if I was going fast enough or too slow.\"\nThat score and a successful two-point conversion gave Curtis a 14-0 edge at halftime and Godwin's interception return with 8:23 left in the game iced the 'W.'\nThe defending league champs will advance to next weekend's quarterfinals, and they expect a better showing on offense to help support the D.\n\"I think we need to do some work on that O-line, get that run game going and execute a little better,\" Gambardella said.\nINJURY UPDATE: Flushing's sophomore starting defensive back Shaquon Roberts was taken to St. Vincent's hospital following a hit to the chest in the first half that had him coughing up blood on the sideline. Flushing's coaching staff said he was \"feeling much better\" after resting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:16:28.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
