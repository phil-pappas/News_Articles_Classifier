The Panthers were the class of the field — both boys and girls — at the Lynx Invitational on Saturday at the North-Linn Community Schools complex. \nManternach and Jordan Loes ran second and fourth to lead the Panthers to a comfortable conquest on the boys’ side. Monticello scored 69 points; Mount Pleasant was second with 91, followed by Mid-Prairie (113) and Vinton-Shellsburg (117). \nIn the girls’ race, runner-up Paige Holub paced the Panthers to the title with 68 points. River Valley Conference rival Cascade was next with 96, followed by South Winneshiek (117) and Marion (124). \nLast year, Monticello’s freshman-dominated girls’ squad won a Class 2A state championship while the boys settled for second after a three-year title run. \n“We have a little bitter taste in our mouths about that,” Manternach said. “That’s what we’re focusing on. We want to go out on top.” \nLogan Murray of Mount Pleasant won the boys’ title in 16:08. Manternach was next in 16:15. Then it was Jeremy Fopma of Marion (16:27) and Loes (16:44). \n“Today was perfect,” Manternach said of the cool weather and the fast course. “I really like running in the morning. It was great weather, then you’ve got the rest of the day to yourself.” \nMarion senior Maddie Bach broke from a four-girl pack shortly after the mile mark, and finished in a career-beat 18:50. Holub, the 2A individual state champion last year as a freshman, was second in 18:56. \n“At first, I thought our pace was too slow, but at the mile I was right where I wanted to be,” Bach said. “Toward the end, I heard somebody yell — I think it was my dad — that I was right on pace to break 19 (minutes), so I took off.” \nBach will be one of the favorites Thursday at the Wamac Conference meet at Independence. So will Julie Hollensbe of Williamsburg and Lily Horst of Vinton-Shellsburg, who finished third and fourth Saturday. \n“I’m excited,” Bach said. “I’ll definitely have a target on my back. I’m definitely going for a conference championship, that’s for sure.” \nLYNX INVITATIONAL CROSS COUNTRY MEET \nAt Troy Mills \nGirls Results \nTeams — 1. Monticello 68, 2. Cascade 96, 3.
