It has been over a year since he tore the patellar tendon in his right knee at Philadelphia and nearly three months since a calf injury sidelined him during the early days of training camp.\nSo if you need a reminder, check out “I am Giant: Victor Cruz,” a soul-bearing documentary that will air on Showtime beginning Oct. 30. The film, directed by Gotham Chopra, opens with Cruz’s 99-yard touchdown against the Jets on Christmas Eve 2011 that propelled them to an eventual Super Bowl victory.\nIt also focuses on his life growing up in Paterson, N.J.; flunking out and then returning to UMass; an emotional discussion about his father’s suicide; and his fears about being able to fully recover from his knee injury.\n“I just feel like it was a moment for me to document a chapter of my life,” Cruz told The Post, “facing adversity, facing injury, and having someone document that side of my life in an in-depth way which has never been done before.”\nThe film was meant to be a triumph over odds, and still is. But it’s shrouded by an air of uncertainty because Cruz hasn’t been able to get back on the field. He wore a helmet, jersey, sweat pants and cleats on Thursday, but mostly stayed off to the side, playing catch with Odell Beckham Jr. or catching passes from a passing machine. He has been ruled out of Sunday’s game against the Cowboys at MetLife Stadium.\n“He’s not cleared to go,” head coach Tom Coughlin said Thursday.\nThe Giants (3-3) are beginning to suffer from his absence. Beckham is drawing the kind of double coverage that made him a non-factor in the second half of Monday night’s 27-7 loss at Philadelphia where he caught seven passes for 61 yards and a TD in the first half, but was targeted just once in the second half, and that was incomplete. Beckham, like the rest of the Giants, are patiently waiting for Cruz to return.\n“He has to get as healthy as he can,” Beckham said. “We’re making sure that he knows that we’re all wishing him well. We all want him to get back on the field.”\nAmong the things Cruz reveals in the candid melodrama is a competitive jealously of Beckham’s success last season.\n“As a human being you feel some type of jealously because you want to be on the field,” Cruz said in the film. “I felt some of that.”\nHe doesn’t feel the same now.\n“Not anymore,” he said Thursday. “I’m a step closer than I was a year ago. I truly feel like I’m going to get my opportunity this year. It’s just a matter of time.”\nShowtime vice president and general manager Stephen Espinoza thinks the uncertainty surrounding Cruz’s return adds intrigue to the film.\n“None of us, including Victor, really knows how his story is going to end,” Espinoza said.\nChopra, who also directed “Kobe Bryant’s Muse,” sees the film like this:\n“This is less about his comeback and more about how did he ever get this far? That part of the story stays intact no matter what happens today or tomorrow.”\nCruz pitched the project to Showtime last spring and included elements of his rehab from knee surgery and events through his most recent setback Sept. 30 when he aggravated the calf injury. He hopes it won’t be long before his comeback is complete.\n“Although the area [of injury] has gotten significantly smaller, there’s still an area there that needs to heal before they can get me out there,” Cruz said.\nA scene in the movie where Cruz discusses his comeback should offer his fans some comfort: “If there’s anybody who can make it through an injury like this and get out the other end, it’s me.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under new york giants ,  victor cruz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:00:46.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
