Tom Smart, \n(Click the play button below to listen) \nWe've reached the midseason point of the college football season and Utah has put together a great start. No. 4 Utah remains undefeated at 5-0 and 2-0 in the Pac-12, while BYU is 4-2, Utah State (3-2, 2-0) is tied for the lead in the Mountain West's Mountain division and SUU (3-2, 2-0) is tied for the Big Sky Conference lead and Weber State (3-3, 2-1) is just a game back of the Thunderbirds. \nIn this week's edition, DeseretNews.com writers Carter Williams and Brandon Judd discuss the DeseretNews.com's midseason awards given Tuesday , including the state's MVP at this point in the season, as well as top offensive player, top defensive player, top coach, top player and more. \nThe two also argue how Kyle Whittingham to USC rumors are more of a sign of respect to Whittingham's coaching performance rather than necessarily believing he is a fit for the now vacant job. \nThis and much, much more in this week's edition of the Deseret News Sports Podcast! \nSubscribe the Deseret News Sports Podcast on or on Stitcher .
