Was in no way malicious or targeting. It kind of just happened,\" said Mitch Gray, the father of Micah. \"He has no fracturing of the spine, nor any spinal chord damage. He has two aggravated discs that are slightly swollen, but doesn't seem like any long term damage. Doctors expect him to make a complete recovery. The amount of concern and love we have been shown has been mind-blowing, so again thank you to everyone.\" \nOnly a junior Gary leads the Wildcats in rushing with 937-yards of 133-yards and 12 touchdowns. The Wildacts are coming off a 29-21 loss to Frenship and will host the Grants Pirates in week 7. We hear Micah should be able to return by district play.
