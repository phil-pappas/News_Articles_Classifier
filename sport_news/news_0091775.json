Among FBS defenders, Garrett ranks No. 3 in QB sacks and is tied for No. 7 in TFLs and No. 5 in forced fumbles. \nKaser, from Strongsville, Ohio, leads the SEC and ranks No. 2 in the FBS with a 49.5 punt average, which is on pace to break his own school record by nearly two yards. In addition, Kaser has placed eight of his 24 boots inside the opponent’s 20-yard line and boomed 12 50-yard plus punts. Kaser is on pace to break the career punt average record at Texas A&M and the SEC. \nKirk, from Scottsdale, Ariz., leads the nation with a 25.1 punt return average (on 11 returns) and is tied for the FBS lead with two punt return touchdowns. He leads the SEC in receiving yards per game with 101.5. He leads all SEC freshmen in scoring, touchdowns, receptions, receiving yards, punt return average and all-purpose yards.
