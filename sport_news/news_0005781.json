In the past, the Cup would be with the Hall's Cup Keepers at a hotel away from players and media. Accordingly, certain pregame publicity elements will be revisited.\" The usual veil of secrecy and security will probably still surround the well-traveled trophy—it isn't as if they are announcing that Keepers of the Cup are going to stop wearing white gloves to hoist the massive cup around or anything. But it would appear that the NHL is going to be on its toes—at least for the next couple of seasons—making sure that a delay in the Cup's arrival isn't an recurring issue.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://espn.go.com/blog/nhl/post/_/id/39822/rumblings-dont-expect-stanley-cup-to-be-late-again"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:13:18.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
