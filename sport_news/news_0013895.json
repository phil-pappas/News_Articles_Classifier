Russo-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Tom Brady threw for 312 yards and three touchdowns and New England took advantage of a botched fake punt in the Patriots' 34-27 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night. The Patriots improved to 5-0 for the first time since 2007. It was the first meeting between the rivals since the \"Deflategate\" storm erupted after the AFC title game in January. For a half, the teams traded jabs. But New England seized control in the second half. Brady's 25-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowksi gave New England a 27-21 lead. And when the Patriots stopped the Colts (3-3) on an odd-looking and ill-advised fake punt, the scrambling Brady eventually found LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard scoring pass that made it 34-21. Andrew Luck was 30 of 50 for 312 yards and three touchdowns in his first game back from an injured right shoulder.
