In 2014, together we shared in the momentous occasion of the team's first points and in 2015 Ferrari supported us to a degree that was above and beyond the requirements of our partnership agreement. \n\"Quite simply, we could not have returned to the grid without them pushing extremely hard to support the MR03B, at the same time as focusing on their own 2015 package.\" \nMercedes motorsport boss Toto Wollf said: \"Mercedes-Benz has a clear Formula One philosophy based around our works Silver Arrows team and supplying benchmark Power Units to independent customer teams. \n\"We believe this approach provides Formula One with greater strength in depth and ensures a deeper level of competitiveness throughout the field.\" \nMercedes supply engines to Williams and Lotus, but the latter are likely to be powered by Renault next year with the French manufacturer set to buy out the cash-strapped team. \nMercedes opted against supplying Red Bull with engines for 2016 earlier this year.
