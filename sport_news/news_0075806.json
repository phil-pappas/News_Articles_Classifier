MAZZOLINI For The Gazette Updated 0 Associated Press \nMontana wide receiver Jamaal Jones (6) huddles up with teammates before playing Weber State last week in Missoula. Weber State won at Washington-Grizzly Stadium for the first time since 1987. \nMISSOULA — Two weeks. \nThat's 14 days between games, a full fortnight for the Montana Grizzlies to sit on their most recent football outing, the kind which any team would hope to move past much more swiftly. \nA fall once so full of promise — perhaps abruptly so — after a season-opening and expectations-compounding win over North Dakota State feels on the brink after an equally stunning home loss to Weber State last Saturday. \nWith a bye week to think about the stakes, the Griz face a second-half gauntlet that must be run, if not in whole then at least in vast majority, for any hope of postseason presence to survive on the other side. At 3-3 and 2-1 in Big Sky games, all five of Montana's remaining opponents have at some point been ranked in the STATS FCS top 25 poll this season. \nMontana, itself now the No. 20 team, can lose likely no more than once and still reach the 24-team playoff bracket. \n\"You want to think that,\" Montana coach Bob Stitt said when asked if his squad is still a playoff contender following its loss to Weber, the final contest in a short stretch of should-be-victories in the middle of UM's schedule. \"We're gonna get some guys healthy. We've just got to worry about the next one. \n\"You find a way to win the next game and you may be real healthy after that. There's always a chance and you've got to keep grinding.\" \nThat next one, vs. North Dakota (4-2, 2-1) on Oct. 24 in Missoula, leads into back-to-back road games against upstart No. 17 Portland State (4-1, 1-1) and Idaho State (2-4, 1-2). Waiting beyond that are the No. 8 Eagles of Eastern Washington (3-2, 2-0) before another away contest at No. 16 Montana State (3-2, 2-1) to finish the regular season. \nThough a once hard cap of seven Division I wins, a former requirement for FCS playoff eligibility, has been repealed with the bracket's recent expansion, the benchmark remains a symbolic club. No team has made the playoffs with fewer victories without earning an automatic bid as conference champion. \nLafayette, winner of the Patriot League in 2013, did make the field despite a 5-6 record because of its 4-1 mark in league games that year. Same story for Coastal Carolina (6-5) out of the Big South in 2010. \nMontana is not likely afforded the same wiggle room. \nThe 13-team Big Sky Conference has been a great humbler for any who dare think too far ahead. One week's hero — i.e. Northern Arizona, which shocked Montana State on Oct. 3 — can become the next week's goats in no time — NAU lost to previously winless UC Davis on Oct 10. \n\"It's crazy. And exciting,\" Montana State coach Rob Ash said. \"I've been in the league 9 years and it's by far the wildest race I've seen. \n\"And it's still early. Shoot, we've still got a lot of this season left to go. I think it's just a tribute to how great this conference has become.\" • • • \nMontana's string of 17 consecutive playoff appearances seems ages ago, but it's important to remember that streak came to an end during a regime shift. Coaching changes aren't always smooth. \nIn fact, the past two head coaches each took a year to gain traction, implementation of new offensive systems with players recruited for prior schemes making for naturally slow progress. \nUnder coach Robin Pflugrad in 2010 the Griz went 7-4, a home loss to rival MSU dooming UM's playoff chances on the last day of the season. The Griz were 5-6 in Mick Delaney's first year in 2012, a season more comparable to this fall perhaps because of the unknowns at quarterback. \nThe 2012 campaign, of course, played out following the sudden dismissal of Pflugrad and Athletic Director Jim O'Day as starting QB Jordan Johnson faced legal issues away from the field. Montana trotted out multiple inexperienced starters — Trent McKinney and Shay Smithwick-Hann — on the way to a 3-5 mark in Big Sky games. \nSound familiar? \nAs the 2015 Griz prepare to put their season in the hands of third-string QB Makena Simis — who replaces injured Chad Chalich who replaced injured Brady Gustafson — coach Stitt's offense will need to lean even more heavily on a defense that's as good as any in recent memory at Montana. \n\"We've got to be perfect on defense,\" Stitt said, pointing to some rare letdowns against the Wildcats. \"Against a team like Weber State that can not throw the ball, we've got to be able to shut those guys out. They were very one-dimensional and we couldn't stop the run.\" \nMontana football at its core is mean defense and if the Griz can stay afloat and see life beyond Thanksgiving, the D' will likely carry them there. \n\"I feel like our identity has been identified,\" Griz cornerback Nate Harris said. \"Defense has always been our identity here at the University of Montana. \n\"Ever since Stitt has gotten here the mental aspect of that has changed a little bit. Everyone is starting to think we're an offensive school since Stitt is an offensive minded coach, but defense is always going to be the strong point of U of M.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:17:05.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
