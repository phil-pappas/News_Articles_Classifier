Tigers move focus to districts, road game at Strafford Photo by Jeff McNiell, Houston Herald \nHouston junior Chance Hunter collides with Liberty’s Marcos Rodriguez during Friday’s regular-season finale. \nMOUNTAIN VIEW – The formula that determines the high school football district standings isn’t easy to understand. But it wasn’t hard to figure out that a lopsided loss was going to hurt Houston’s position. \nThe Tigers slid from fourth to fifth place in Class 2 District 3 with a 63-7 defeat Friday night at Liberty. \nInstead of hosting a district game, the Tigers will instead travel to Strafford to begin postseason play. \n“We didn’t take care of business and left it in the formula’s hands,” HHS coach Eric Sloan said. \nIt was a predictable slide following the regular-season finale. \nLiberty took control from the get-go with a short kickoff that the Eagles recovered. They scored five plays later and raced ahead 35-0 after the opening 12 minutes. \nLiberty built a 49-0 halftime advantage and led 63-0 entering the fourth quarter to easily clinch the South Central Association championship. \n“It was ugly from the beginning and snowballed,” Sloan said. “I’m not sure what happened. \n“We don’t need to watch the film or relive any of it. That was not us.” \nThe good news for the Tigers (4-5, 2-5 SCA) is they get to quickly move on. \nHHS hits the road Friday night to face Strafford, which moved ahead two spots from sixth to fourth to host the district opener. \nSloan said he expects a better showing from his team. \n“I hope we play with a sense of urgency,” he said. “We’ve got to get out fast without hiccups and mental breakdowns. I’m hoping we’re hungry to get back on the right track. I hope we show up to play.” \nThere were some positives for the Tigers in the Liberty loss. PHOTOS: HHS football vs. Mountain View-Liberty \nJunior Chance Hunter carried the ball 22 times for 124 yards and a touchdown. Freshman Paydon Dixon directed two fourth-quarter drives and was 3-of-4 passing for 40 yards. Two of those completions went to Michael Clayton, who caught his first career varsity passes and finished with 31 yards. \n“Paydon is a gutsy fella,” Sloan said. “He’s kind of a duel threat guy. He’s got to have a good offseason for us.” \nLiberty quarterback Josh Pruett threw for 208 yards and four scores. He also ran for a team-best 73 yards and a score. \nMarcos Rodriguez had three second-half rushing touchdowns. \nHouston converted its final drive into its lone points. Hunter had consecutive runs of 29 and 30 yards and following a 20-yard pass from Dixon to Clayton, he plowed into the end zone from two yards away with 3 minutes, 9 seconds left in the game. \nThe Tigers committed four turnovers –– leading to 20 Liberty points. \n“Take nothing away from them. They deserve their state ranking and SCA title,” Sloan said. “I’ve never experienced giving up 35 points in a quarter. It went from bad to worse really quick.” \nBOX SCORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:35:49.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
