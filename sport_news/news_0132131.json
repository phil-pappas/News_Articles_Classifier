The Astros lead 3-1 at the end of two innings at Kauffman Stadium. \nThe Astros got to Yordano Ventura early, scoring two runs on two hits and a walk in the first inning. The first three batters reached as Jose Altuve singled to left, George Springer walked and Carlos Correa singled to right. \nConsecutive groundouts by Colby Rasmus and Evan Gattis produced runs before Ventura got out of it with a strikeout. \nThe Astros, though, weren’t done yet. They tacked on another run in the second with a two-out rally, and again Altuve was in the middle of it. Center fielder Jake Marisnick hit a double to the left-center gap, and Altuve drove him in with a base hit to right to put the Royals in a 3-0 hole. \nKendrys Morales homered to right off Astros starter Collin McHugh in the second to put the Royals on the board. \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:57:19.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
