The kids are from the programs James has started through his family's foundation. \nDuring the summer, James announced a partnership with the university to provide free four-year educations to city students who qualify. \nObama recently launched her Reach Higher public awareness campaign to encourage students to aim higher than just a high school diploma. \nJames, who went from high school to the pros, grew up in Akron and the 30-year-old father of three has spent much of his career giving back to his community. \nThink your friends should see this?
