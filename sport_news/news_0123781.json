And Kendall obviously feels like he can help us win. There's no issue there,” Whisenhunt said. \"I talked with Kendall today, and obviously, if you look statistically, he is an important part. He's our leading receiver. He's getting a lot of targets, and his production is way up. He will continue to be a big part of our offense.” \nWhisenhunt dismissed any idea that he had lost the locker room and insisted that the Titans are close to being a good football team. \n\"I think you can't ignore the fact that we're close,\" Whisenhunt said. \"But close and $4 will get you a cup of coffee. We've got to kind of block out the distractions and continue to work. There's a tremendous amount of progress with our team but we've got to get over that hump. We've got to win a game and I think once we do that, that's going to really put us on the right course.\" \nInjury news: \nTennessee Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan suffered another stinger injury that forced him out of the Titans' 14-13 loss to the Buffalo Bills in the fourth quarter on Sunday. \n“It'll happen four or five times a game. I've just got to keep on going. It happened at the first of the game but this game isn't about me getting injured. It's about this team and where we need to go from here,” Lewan said. \nLewan wasn't the only Titans player injured in the game. Linebacker Zach Brown, who was benched at the outset of the game, suffered a right leg injury and did not return to the contest and Kendall Wright took a knock at the end of regulation. \nThe Titans square off against the Miami Dolphins on Oct. 18 at Nissan Stadium in Nashville.
