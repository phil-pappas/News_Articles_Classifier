Online entertainment news website said Odom, who was left fighting for his life after collapsing at the Love Ranch brothel last week, was being moved to a medical facility nearer to his Los Angeles home.

Earlier on Monday, a family statement said Odom was improving steadily.\n\"Each day Lamar is getting stronger and reaching significant milestones in his recovery.
