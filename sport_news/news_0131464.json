It’s really hard to explain. It was like a season coming to an end and having to restart it again. \n“We didn’t play for 13 days and it showed against Yamhill. We had penalties. The game rust. If one guy misses a game, you don’t see it as much as if a whole team misses a game. That was different for our kids, and for our coaches, too.” \nIn Cascade’s Sept. 25 upset loss to Philomath, Cascade led 7-0 in the second quarter, but gave up 26 straight points and lost 26-14. \nBut then Newport forfeited its Oct. 2 game to Cascade due to injuries, essentially giving the Cougars a bye week. \nCascade led 29-0 after one quarter against Yamhill-Carlton Oct. 8 and was up 42-0 at halftime. \n“We had some things go wrong in the Philomath game and we wanted to fix those,” Turner said. “We have an identity now offensively that we’re going to follow, and that’s good. I think we lost our identity against Philomath.” \nWhat Cascade faces in No. 5-ranked Stayton is a team that exceeded expectations all season by starting 6-0 and 3-0 in the Oregon West Conference. \nIt’s been a long time since both teams were ranked in the top five in the state when they played. \n“The Stayton-Cascade rivalry’s always a big one no matter what the records are,” Turner said. “It helps our league. It makes our league more competitive. I knew they were going to be a good team.” \nStayton poses a unique challenge for Cascade. \nThe Eagles average 211 yards per game rushing and 201 yards passing per game behind the strong arm of senior quarterback Kyle Schwarm, who has passed for 1,206 yards and 11 touchdowns. \nBut Stayton also leads the state by holding opponents to 29 points this season. \nHow do you beat a team that well balanced? \n“That’s the million dollar question,” Turner said. “Their quarterback is an outstanding runner as well as passer and they have quality receivers. We have some ideas, but again it’s too early to tell if it will work on the field.” 4 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/1RDhiMM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:19:09.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
