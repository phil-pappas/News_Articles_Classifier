Hayes, a junior who has already committed verbally to play at Georgia Tech, finished the contest with 37 kills. Jones, among a large group of senior starters returning this year, led the defensive effort with 11 digs while setter Regan Lohlein posted 62 assists. \nHeritage was led by returning starters Kara Groover, Hallie Hunt and Zofia Powell. The contest ended a marathon day for Kara Groover and her sister Karlee, who helped lead the school’s softball team to a sweep of Terrell Academy earlier on Thursday a first-round state-playoff series. \n“They are special athletes,” Heritage head coach Mary Louise Hunt said. “To play two sports in the same season isn’t easy, but it’s something we have been able to work around, and they have done a great job handling.” \nAfter Trinity pushed the lead to 2-1, the Lady Hawks made them work to close out the match. Trinity shot itself in the foot several times with careless serves in the last set that put points on the Heritage side of the scoreboard. \nTrinity pushed the lead to 11-3 in the fifth set, before the Lady Hawks made one last run, cutting the lead to 19-14. \n“It was a lot closer than the score might show,” Herrera said. “It was to really good volleyball teams out there tonight. I think we did a really good job finishing.” \nDespite some poor serving early in the fifth set, an ace by Chasey Mitchell and Peyton Lohlein helped put the match away. \nHeritage took early control of the contest jumping out to a 13-9 lead in the first set, before Trinity used a 5-1 run the Lady Lions to tie it at 14-14. A kill by Hayes then gave the Lady Lions a lead for good in a 1-0 set advantage. \nThe Lady Hawks rallied back to tie the match, jumping out to a 6-1 lead in game two and fighting Trinity off after it closed to 11-10 and 23-23. \nTrinity fought off a determined Heritage team early in the fourth set. After the Lady Hawks took a 9-8 lead, the Lady Lions closed out the game with a 17-5 run. \nDespite the loss to their biggest rivals, Hunt knows her team still has chances at the state tournament. \n“I thought we played really hard tonight,” she said. “We don’t have the height to match Trinity, so that makes it tough. But I am really proud of the way we played.” More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:20:45.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
