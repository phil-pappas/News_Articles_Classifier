The championship is gone and second place is not worth the risk of crashing again and making the injury worse. \n\"I am disappointed we weren't able to fight to the end, but congratulations to Johann Zarco on the championship. He's ridden a faultless season and will be a worthy champion.\" \nKalex rider Zarco leads Rabat in the championship by 78 points with a total of 75 still to be won in the three races after Japan.
