The rest is history,” Wilkins said. \nAs a football coach and teacher, Wilkins made and taught a lot of history at Cedar Shoals. His most recent change in direction, returning as the Jaguars’ head football coach last season after retiring in 2007, has him in unfamiliar territory. \nThe Jaguars have won once in their last 17 games. \n“I knew it would take time to turn the program around. I did not think it would take this long. We’re basically rebuilding the culture of the community with regards to football specifically,” said Wilkins, whose team plays at Gainesville on Friday. \nA native of Alpharetta, Wilkins came to Athens as a kid to attend football games and to show horses for 4-H. \nHe first joined Cedar Shoals in 1990 as an assistant coach, and four years later he became head coach. \nFrom 1994-2007, Wilkins never experienced a losing season. He is the winningest coach in school history. The football stadium is named after him. \nHe decided to retire in 2007 and left the team with an overall record of 106-50-1. \nAfter realizing he was not able to fully step away, he took an assistant coaching job at Athens Academy, where he could sit in the passenger’s seat. \n“It was a great opportunity,” Wilkins said, “but after a few years, I started to get the itch to lead a program again. \n“Have you ever ridden with two people on a horse? With two people on a horse, one rides up front. When you’re the head coach you’re riding up front and when you’re not, you’re the second or third person on the horse and you’re just along for the ride. I wanted to ride up front again.” \nIn 2014, Cedar Shoals was looking for a football coach, and Wilkins was available and willing. \nWilkins said he’s coaching the right way by putting education first and coaching boys to become men. He is ready to start winning, though, and said he works hard for it every Friday night. \n“We have closed the gap tremendously from where we started last year to where we are today. The gap that remains is about six inches and that’s the six inches between our ears. I have sensed that we are on the cusp, just not over the hump,” Wilkins said. \nCedar Shoals athletic director Roger Edmonds played an integral role in the re-hiring of Wilkins. \nWhen Edmonds moved to Athens, he found himself in a new place with a packed-full moving truck. Wilkins volunteered to help. \n“He was the person I met and the only person I could find to help me unload my furniture. He did it all for a Wendy’s burger. He is a man of integrity and so much of what I know about dealing with kids, I learned from him,” Edmonds said. \nWilkins’ return to Cedar Shoals did not come without condition. L’Dreco Thomas had to be a part of his staff. Thomas served as offensive coordinator before Wilkins’ hiatus and agreed to continue if Wilkins returned, despite also serving as the head coach for men’s basketball. \n“It was a no-brainer for me,” Thomas said. “Water boy or offensive coordinator, I’ll do it. He helped me out as a young teacher. Ever since, we’ve only gotten closer. He told me I could pass ‘the daddy test,’ meaning I am someone he would want teaching his kids, and that meant a lot to me. \n“He is the ultimate example of someone I would want teaching my children.” \nMore often than not for coaches, there’s a distinction between the football field and the classroom. Wilkins said he “teaches football and coaches U.S. history. \n“You can’t separate one from the other,” he said. “I expect academic excellence. I expect performance in the classroom as well as performance on the field.” \nEverything is a history lesson for Wilkins, Thomas said. Every year on Labor Day, Wilkins tells the team the story behind the holiday. He constantly uses lessons from the classroom and applies them to the field. \nA handlebar mustache that Wilkins has sported since his playing days in college at Wofford and his commanding voice may present a hard exterior shell. But his actions show a caring, soft side, too. \nHe once took a player who had become a new father to a store to buy diapers for his baby. He does laundry for his team every day, since many do not have means of cleaning their clothes. \n“This is not about Scott Wilkins,” he said. “This is about the kids in the community and the guys that go to this school. I want them to have a taste of the success that their forebearers had.” \nWilkins said he would like to remain at Cedar Shoals for 11 more years, totaling 50 in the school system. \nBy that point, he said, he hopes the hard times will be nothing but history. \nThe Grady Sports Bureau is part of the Sports Media Certificate program at the University of Georgia’s Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:31:50.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
