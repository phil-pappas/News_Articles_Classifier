Coach: Tony Bennett. \nConference: Atlantic Coast. \nKey returners: Malcolm Brogdon, top returning scorer (14 ppg) and second-team All-American, is the unquestioned leader and a steadying force on the court; Anthony Gill (11.6 ppg, 6.5 rpg) is the top rebounder and inside scoring threat who Bennett hopes to utilize more this season; Mike Tobey, the enigmatic 7-foot who can score inside and out, rebound and blocks shots, but battles his confidence and sometimes goes missing on the court. \nWho left: Justin Anderson, the team's best 3-point shooter and lock-down defender, and Darion Atkins, whose offensive flashes were just a bonus to complement his backline rim-protecting. \nThe Skinny: The Cavaliers have changed their expectations after consecutive 30-win seasons and ACC regular season titles, but have been ousted from the NCAA tournament in both years by Michigan State. With four seniors (Brogdon, Gill, Tobey and Evan Nolte) in the rotation, this is their last chance to bring Virginia a national championship. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:03:34.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
