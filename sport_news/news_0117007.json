So far this season, the 0-3 Lions have been calling plays like it’s the end of dominance for one of the NFL’s greatest-ever downfield weapons.\nContrary to his “Megatron” nickname, Johnson has been a possession receiver this season, hauling in 20 passes for 199 yards, just under 10 yards per catch. He’s averaging only 6.2 air yards from scrimmage every time he catches the ball, a radical departure from how he was utilized in prior seasons (11.2 air yards per reception). Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford used to heave bombs to the 6-foot-5, 240-pound Johnson no matter how covered the Lions’ top receiver appeared to be, realizing that Johnson could likely overpower or out-jump any defensive back for the football.\nIt’s a big reason why the Lions, with an offense that ranks 25th in yards per pass play and 23rd in points, remain winless heading into Monday night’s game against the Seahawks.\nHistory suggests that wide receivers don’t typically slow down this early in their careers. Active ones with at least 300 catches are targeted about the same distance (9.0 yards downfield) after turning 30 as before (9.5).\nPlus Johnson has made a strong case for being the greatest wide receiver ever through age 29, averaging an NFL record 87.4 receiving yards per game, according to Pro-Football-Reference. To get an idea of how all-time greats age at the position, consider that Jerry Rice (84 yards per game through age 29) caught 869 passes for 13,823 yards with 104 touchdowns from his age 30 season until his retirement at age 42 in 2004.\nENLARGE", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP535_Count__G_20151004182049.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:42:16.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
