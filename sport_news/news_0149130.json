Shower or two. Sport Cowboys and Maroons legend Matt Bowen on impending retirement and NRL grand final by: What are these? RETIRING GREAT: Former North Queensland Cowboys fullback Matt Bowen has tipped his old club to win this weekend’s grand final against the Brisbane Broncos. PICTURE: JAKE NOWAKOWSKI Source: News Limited \nTWO decades on from when Matt Bowen first played football as a schoolboy at Ingham, the star fullback and North Queensland Cowboys legend is two grand finals away from retirement. \nBowen, a Cairns-born former Maroon and Kangaroo, has tipped his old club to win by six points in tomorrow’s historic NRL premiership decider. \nHe will watch the game from his home in Greater Manchester and thinks the Cowboys will need to fire in order to beat the Brisbane Broncos. \nBut the 33-year-old, who was raised in Hope Vale and played 270 games for North Queensland, has a grand final of his own next weekend in the English Super League. \nThe Cairns Post spoke with Bowen the morning before his team, the Wigan Warriors, smashed their way past the Huddersfield Giants. \nBowen and the Warriors will contest the 2015 Super League premiership next Saturday at Manchester’s Old Trafford stadium. \nReflecting on his unsuccessful NRL premiership bid in 2005, Bowen said a more experienced and disciplined Cowboys side would learn from their previous errors.
