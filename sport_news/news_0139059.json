And while they are a minor league club, they will boast plenty of pro experience. \nJosh Freeman, who spent five years in the NFL with the Dolphins, Bucs and Vikings, will quarterback the team while former Rutgers head coach and NFL QB guru Terry Shea will be the head man as the Bolts look to build on their inaugural season, when they went 4-0 and finished in first (the Fall Experimental Football League couldn’t put together a title game). \n“Last year’s team in Boston was the pioneer of this league, playing in a league with no history,” said Shea, who coached the Boston Brawler last season. “This year (the Bolts) understand the history, they embrace it and that’s the way they take the practice field.” \nPart of what has put the Bolts a jump-start ahead of the other two teams in the league, according to Shea, is the welcome addition of Freeman, who brings the poise and knowledge of an NFL starter to a roster full of raw abilities. \nThe former Bucs quarterback captured the starting job in Tampa in 2010, which turned into his best season at the helm of the offense. Freeman threw 25 touchdowns and only six interceptions, leading Tampa Bay to a 10-6 record. \nBrooklyn is not even 10 practices deep, but Shea said the 27-year-old quarterback’s physical stature alone has commanded attention and respect from the start. \n“He’s willing to share in QB meetings and it’s neat to see that, but he has a real capacity to reach out to the rest of the players,” he said. “He’s handling it like this is his first week of rookie camp.” \nWhile Freeman’s promising start as an NFL quarterback when he was just 22 has since fizzled out, the FXFL is a chance for him to return to the good graces of NFL evaluators. \n“The other guys look at Josh and they say, well, ‘why is he here?’” Shea said. “This league gives them a great opportunity. They know what is at stake.” \nThe Bolts make their return to MCU Park and a borough that has long been football-starved, despite recently seeing two different professional sports franchises settle in. \nWoods acknowledged that it takes time to build a fan-base, but he believes the well-known names will bring more people out for the team’s five-game season. \n“As long as the FXFL is in business, we will have a team in Brooklyn,” Woods said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:43:21.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
