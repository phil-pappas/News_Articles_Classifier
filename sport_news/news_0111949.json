Magistrate Judge Ellen Carmody urged Curtis to get an attorney to help him in a lawsuit. \nThe Grand Rapids Press ( http://bit.ly/1PO2DQX ) says Curtis apologized Monday for a filing identifying the women by name. Curtis says he has \"truth\" on his side and can't afford a lawyer. \nThe women want to move the case directly to financial damages, noting that Curtis already has been convicted. The conviction is being appealed. \nInformation from: The Grand Rapids Press, http://www.mlive.com/grand-rapids \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:47:42.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
