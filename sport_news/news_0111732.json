Barkov, 20, left the locker room with his hand wrapped in a bandage of some kind.\nThe Panthers don’t comment on injuries, however, Panthers coach Gerard Gallant said he hoped it wasn’t broken.\n“It’s a big loss. He’s our best player,’’ said Jaromir Jagr, Barkov’s linemate. “He’s going to be tough to replace. Nobody knows for how long he’s going to be out. It’s going to be even tougher. We got to do it no matter what.’’\nBarkov will be evaluated further when the swelling goes down. Gallant said he may elevate Vincent Trocheck or Brandon Pirri to the top line with Jagr and a slumping Jonathan Huberdeau, who has yet to score a goal and committed two gaffes earlier this week in losses to Dallas and Pittsburgh.\nBarkov’s absence could mean that rookie forward Rocco Grimaldi could be recalled from the Portland Pirates, the Panthers’ AHL afiliate. Grimaldi sustained an ankle injury in the third preseason game and was placed on injured reserve at the start of the regular season.\nOnce he rehabbed the ankle in the team’s training facility, the Panthers sent him to the AHL to get into game shape. The 5-foot-6 speedy Grimaldi is a natural center so he could slide into Barkov’s slot. Panthers General Manager Dale Tallon has repeatedly said he expects Grimaldi to play many games for the parent club this season.\nThe Pirates are scheduled to play Albany at home Friday and a rematch in Albany, N.Y., on Saturday. Grimaldi has played two games for Portland and has one assist.\nThe Panthers practice in Dallas on Friday. If Barkov doesn’t play Saturday against the red-hot 6-1 Stars - who thrashed host Pittsburgh 4-1 Thursday for their fifth straight victory – then either Grimaldi meets the team in Dallas or Gallant plays defenseman Steven Kampfer at forward as he did last season in a few games.\nMost likely, Grimaldi will be on an early flight to Dallas Friday morning.\n Pittsburgh Panthers American Hockey League Portland Pirates Jaromir Jagr Brandon Pirri Dale Tallon Steve Kampfer", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5629c94e/turbine/sfl-barkovs-injury-could-mean-grimaldi-is-on-the-way-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:14:35.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
