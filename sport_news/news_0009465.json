Manfred says it's \"not appropriate\" to enforce pace-of-play rules as strictly during the postseason. Speaking before Toronto hosted Texas in Game 2 of their AL Division Series, Manfred said he was pleased with cooperation from players during the regular season, when the average time of a nine-inning game was cut by six minutes this year to 2:56.
