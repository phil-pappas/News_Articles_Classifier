His team was selected by the league's coaches to finish tied for seventh. \nThat projection marked a downturn for the program, just one season removed from reaching the Elite Eight. Last season's results were worse than the conference's coaches predicted, with the Golden Eagles tying Creighton for last in the league and finishing with an overall record of 13-19. \nWhen the 2015-'16 coaches' poll came out ahead of Big East media day on Wednesday, Marquette moved up just one spot from last year to sixth, one point behind Providence. Villanova was the unanimous pick to repeat as champion, followed by Georgetown, Butler and Xavier. \nMarquette's slight jump doesn't do justice to the heightened expectations surrounding the Golden Eagles, who with the conference's top recruiting class are considered a wild-card contender entering this season. \n\"I think our program is light years ahead today of where it was when I took over,\" Wojciechowski said Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. \n\"We have a chance to be a very good team. We have to be process driven, though, we have to get better each day because we're not a group yet that has habits or knows what it takes to win because the guys in the program haven't won yet.\" \nFreshman forward Henry Ellenson is arguably the biggest reason Marquette believes it can turn things around following one of the less successful seasons in program history. The 6-foot-10 forward from Rice Lake is one of the top recruits in the country and will make an impact on both ends of the court immediately. \nOn Wednesday, Ellenson was named second team all-Big East. He was the only Marquette player named to the first or second team and the league's only freshman on either squad. In fact, he is the first freshman to earn preseason all-Big East first or second team honors since the preseason all-rookie team was discontinued in 1992-'93. \nInterestingly enough, Ellenson wasn't named the conference's preseason rookie of the year — that honor went to Villanova guard Jalen Brunson, who was one of four players named honorable mention all-Big East along with Marquette junior center Luke Fischer. \nEllenson knows what he's getting into — he was on campus often last year because his brother, Wally, is on the team. \n\"There's a lot of excitement around and that's fun,\" Henry said. \"There's big expectations for this year, and we have big expectations for ourselves because we're a talented group.\" \nThis will be Fischer's first full campaign after transferring from Indiana midway through his freshman year, and he's willing to chalk up last season as a learning experience and move on. \nAs high as his expectations are, he knows those of his head coach may be even higher. \n\"(Wojciechowski) held us to a high standard as soon as he got here last year,\" Fischer said. \"I think that standard's actually risen even higher. He expects a lot out of us, but as a player himself he knows what we can all do.\" \nHigh expectations are nothing new at Marquette. The Golden Eagles went to the NCAA Tournament from 2006-'13. There was a positive outlook ahead of last season, too. However, any good feelings were likely focused on the future of the program being on the right track under Wojciechowski. \nThis year, the hope within the program and among the fan base is that last year represents the only rebuilding year and future success begins now. \nEither way, Wojciechowski welcomes it. He wants high expectations and doesn't mind if people outside his program have low ones. In both situations, he wants his players to be able to keep blinders up and focus. \n\"Whether we have high expectations and start out the season like gangbusters and everybody's telling us how good we are, we can't then believe that,\" Wojciechowski said. \n\"The flip side is true also. Our thing is to get better every day. We have a young team that needs to build habits on the offense and defensive end and you do that through daily effort and grind.\" BIG EAST PRESEASON COACHES POLL \n1. Villanova (9) 81 points, 2.
