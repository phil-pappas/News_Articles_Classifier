I can imagine myself in their shoes and how I would feel if it was me. \n“But personally that is good for me. It motivates me. I want to put in a performance for them if I’m selected. I want to make them proud because they have made all of us proud.” \nIronically, Strauss could actually benefit from the decision to suspend Gray. \nWith only Tim Swinson as recognised second-row cover, No.8 David Denton may be asked to step up to provide back-up at lock, leaving his back-row slot free for Strauss. \nBut whoever head coach Vern Cotter decides to pick, Strauss insists the players will not be distracted by the disappointment of seeing their teammates ruled out of the tournament. \n“Rugby is an environment of adversity and we have all experienced enough things and dealt with them in the past so this will just make us stronger as a group,” the 28-year-old said. \n“Now we’ll just park our emotions and focus on the game.” \nSouth Africa-born Strauss has plenty experience taking on the best players from Down Under following his spell with the Lions in Super Rugby. \nBut even with two of the Scots’ most important players ruled out, Strauss is still walking into the last-eight crunch with a confident stride. \n“I’m much older than some of the guys in the team but this is still the biggest game of my career. \n“But you don’t come into a competition thinking you can’t win it. \n“I’ve been lucky enough to face a couple of their players before in Super Rugby and anybody can be beaten. \n“We’ve earned the right to be here and we’re going to show it at the weekend. There is no sense that we can be intimidated by them. The feeling is we are going to win. The belief is that we will win.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:40:39.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
