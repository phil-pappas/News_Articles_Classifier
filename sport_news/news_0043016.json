You want to say that you won the whole thing,” said Quinn as BU prepared for tonight’s season-opening game at Union. “But, every team wants that.”\nIn addition to losing Eichel, who now plays in the NHL for the Buffalo Sabres, BU graduated clever forwards Evan Rodrigues and Cason Hohman. The trio accounted for a 163 points on 58 goals and 105 assists.\nBut the cupboard isn’t bare. Junior Danny O’Regan of Needham produced a 50-point season (23-27-50) and Ahti Oksanen chipped in with 25 goals, only one behind Eichel’s team-high total. Under-the-radar freshman forwards Nikolas Olsson (six goals) and A.J. Greer (three goals) hinted at becoming top-end talents. Greer and incoming freshmen Jordan Greenway and Jakob Forsbacka Karlsson were selected in the second round of last spring’s NHL draft. Karlsson showcased his prodigious skills with a pair of third-period lamp-lighters in the recent 4-2 exhibition win over Arcadia.\nThe real strength for the third-ranked Terriers is their defense. Sophomore Chris Hickey was arguably BU’s most consistent defender last season and was overlooked by the coaches as an All-Hockey East pick. Hickey’s blueline partner, Brandon Fortunato, is a deft puck handler and ace passer.\nCharlestown’s Matt Grzelcyk, who was a third-round pick of the Bruins, is as fine a skater as there is among college defensemen and enjoyed a brilliant second half of the season for BU.\nUnsung Brien Diffley of Burlington and mammoth 6-foot-5 Doyle Somerby of Marblehead were pleasant surprises at the blue line. BU has added to that mix with promising freshmen Charlie McAvoy and Shane Switzer.\n“We return our whole (defensive corps and it’s a strong group,” said Quinn. “It’s a pretty good place to start.”\nGoaltender Matt O’Connor signed with Ottawa but Sean Maguire, who missed last season with concussion issues, joins sophomore Connor LaCouvee to form a solid tandem in net.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:11:31.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
