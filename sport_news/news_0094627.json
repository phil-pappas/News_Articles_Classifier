Instead, the 29-year-old was insistent on making a change in an attempt to elevate his game to the next level, taking his long-term success into consideration.\n\"I was talking to my wife, and she said 'You were always your best at your college weight,' \" Lowry told Stack's Jordan Zirm. \"The saying is, the older you get, the lighter you've got to be. I thought Ray Allen did a great job of that, and Chauncey Billups too.\"\nAllen and Billups both stayed effective up until their mid-30's, an accomplishment in itself that all NBA players strive for.\n\"I want to be special,\" Lowry told Zirm. \"At the end of the day it's all about me and how I feel and what I can provide for my team and my family.\"\nIn his 70 regular season games last year, Lowry averaged 17.8 points, 6.8 assists, and shot 41.2 percent from the field, statistics that earned him the first All-Star nod of his career.\nHe led the Raptors to their winningest regular season in franchise history before their campaign was ultimately cut short as they were swept by the Wizards in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. He only averaged 12.3 points and 4.8 assists on 31.6 percent shooting during the series.\nAlthough fans have only had a short glimpse of the slimmer Lowry, it appears as though he's much improved, prepared to rectify 2015's postseason disappointment.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:23:05.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
