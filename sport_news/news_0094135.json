There was no evidence of bodily harm on Crowley, except for a wrist abrasion that resulted from Manziel trying to stop her from getting out of the car.\nAvon Sgt. George Ruple told Northeast Ohio Media Group that Manziel did not appear to be impaired and admitted to having two drinks earlier that day. Crowley was impaired, Ruple said.\nShe did not want to press charges and neither of them were arrested.\nThe Browns have talked to Manziel about the incident and said in a statement from general manager Ray Farmer \"it is a matter that we take seriously.''\nThe NFL also said it is aware and would have no further comment at this time. Colleen and I got into a dumb public argument on the way home Monday afternoon. It probably looked more interesting than it was and...\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015 I know I would stop and check if I saw a couple arguing on the side of the road. It was embarrassing but not serious...\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015 and when we talked to the police and they realized everything was alright and I was sober, we went home together and everything is fine.\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015\nBefore things get blown out of proportion.\nA photo posted by Colleen Crowley (@coll_crowley) on Oct 16, 2015 at 3:15pm PDT", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/86jZOzlA-y/", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655166124254994436", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655166174418870272", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655165925822480384"], "published": "2015-10-17T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:21:18.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
