The teenager's strike was blocked but the ball fell kindly for Lamela to tap home into an empty net. \nThomas Lemar, Fabio Coentrao and Lacina Traore attempted to draw parity, with the latter's effort coming on the break after Alli showed composure that belied his tender years to cut back for Kane, whose shot was smothered by Subasic. \nJan Vertonghen stretched to deny Lacina Traore before time was called on an impressive first half by Spurs, who were being forced to defend more when play resumed. \nHowever, Kane had an effort deflected behind at the other end and Eric Dier had a header saved from the resulting corner, with the former then heading straight at Subasic - missed chances Spurs were made to rue as the match came to a close. \nNabil Dirar, introduced minutes earlier from the bench, sent in a fine, right-wing cross to El Shaarawy, whose header stumped Lloris after taking a slight deflection off Trippier. \nIt gave Leonardo Jardim's men renewed confidence and only a wonderful challenge from Rose thwarted Guido Carrillo after Lloris spilt Dirar's long-range drive.
