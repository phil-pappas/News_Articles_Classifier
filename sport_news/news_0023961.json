Coleman was released from jail on Friday with the investigation ongoing, and any charges likely waiting until after the results of toxicology results are in. \nCarroll said during his weekly Monday press conference that the suspension had not yet been lifted but would be. He said it was too early to know if Coleman could play against the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday and said Coleman has yet to see the team’s doctors to determine the extent of any possible injuries sustained in the accident. \nCarroll said the suspension was lifted after speaking with Coleman and reviewing some of the evidence, such as the tapes of meetings with the police.
