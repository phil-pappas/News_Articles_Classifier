Kela walked toward home plate and began trading words with Donaldson.\nTexas catcher Chris Gimenez and plate umpire Vic Carapazza quickly stepped between the two, and the order was restored a few moments later. Donaldson stared intently at Kela as the rookie right-hander returned to the mound.\nDonaldson eventually struck out on a dropped third strike and was thrown out at first base.\nIt was the second time in this postseason that benches had cleared. The Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates got into a dust-up Wednesday in the NL wild-card game after Chicago ace Jake Arrieta was hit by a pitch.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Players on both sides are restrained following an exchange of words between Toronto Blue Jays' Josh Donaldson and Texas Rangers' Keone Kela during the 13th inning of baseball Game 2 of the American League Division Series in Toronto, Friday, Oct. 9, 2015.
