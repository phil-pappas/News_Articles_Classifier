The government indication came amid opposition Congress siding with the judiciary and making it clear that it would not back any “adventurism” by the government. Responding to questions on whether the Congress would stand with the government in case it piloted a fresh version of the NJAC legislation, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “We are not going to back any adventurism by the government. We have to forget the past and look ahead. The way forward is to realise that there is a great trust deficit as far as the government is concerned. This grave deficit arises not from an individual act, but from perceived assault on institutions, which has led to a feeling that this government wants to impose its will on institutions, including the judiciary.” Even as the government is keeping the option of calling an all-party meeting to discuss the issue open, the quashing of the Act has caused division between the ruling BJP and the Congress. Congress leaders privately said any move to call an all-party meeting at this juncture would be “premature and would amount to panic reaction by the PMO”. The BJP, on the other hand, accused the Congress of playing politics on the legislation that it supported in Parliament. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “The Congress is playing politics. It should be reminded that when the NJAC legislation was brought to Parliament, there was 100 per cent support for it among political parties. The Congress backed it and so did 20 state assemblies.” CPM Politburo, meanwhile, adopted a clear stand, backing a new comprehensive law. “Taking the opportunity, Parliament should enact a fresh legislation to constitute a National Judicial Commission which is more broad-based and representative,” said the CPM. The provision of having two eminent persons as commission members was objectionable and compromised the independence of judges’ selection process by tilting it in favour of the executive. Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, said, “The SC has agreed to hear the matter. Now that the issue is before the apex court, we will wait to see how things pan out. The real thing is a sense of distrust in this government and its intentions on the autonomy of institutions. The government must first remove those misgivings.” As the BJP weighs its options, Law Minister Sadanand Gowda today held a meeting after which indications emerged that the government would present its views on the issue of transparent appointment of judges when the SC takes up hearing on the issue from November 3.
