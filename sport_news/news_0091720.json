Here are this week's selections starting with Thursday night's Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers game: \nThe NFC West standings make little sense. At the bottom are the two teams that have dominated the division for years. \nYet there sit Seattle and San Francisco, both 2-4 as they head into Thursday night's game at Levi's Stadium. \nWhat gives? \nIn Seattle, the once fearsome defense does late in games. In San Francisco, the overhauling of the roster, particularly so many retirements by key players, has hurt. \nStill, this is one of the league's nastiest rivalries, even with Jim Harbaugh gone from the Bay Area. \nSeahawks All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman doesn't long to see Harbaugh or sparring partner Michael Crabtree, the wide receiver now in Oakland. \n\"I'm not going to miss either, because I think I'm still playing,\" Sherman said. \"When you're playing this game, you try not to worry about other people as much as you worry about what you can do and what your team does. ... So I don't think I think about either of those guys very much.\" \nJim Tomsula, Harbaugh's replacement as Niners coach, has plenty to think about in this matchup. \n\"They still have their fiery attitude,\" Tomsula said. \"It's a really good team. There's no mistake about that. I know the record is the record, but the Seahawks are very good.\" \nSeattle (No. 15 in AP Pro32 ) is a 6-point choice at No. 23 San Francisco. \nBEST BET: SEAHAWKS, 24-13 \nNo. 27 Tampa Bay (plus 3 1-2) at No. 25 Washington \nWith no real strong feelings for any underdogs this week, going with a rested Tampa Bay. \nUPSET SPECIAL: BUCCANEERS, 20-19 \nNo. 6 New York Jets (plus 9) at No. 1 New England \nJets could make their division — and entire AFC — more interesting with a win. Sorry ... \nPATRIOTS, 30-20 \nNo. 29 Baltimore (plus 7 1-2) at No. 7 Arizona, Monday night \nAt some point, the Ravens we expected might show up. Not in prime time. \nCARDINALS, 27-17 \nNo. 12 Philadelphia (plus 3) at No. 4 Carolina \nA Carolina letdown wouldn't be shocking after huge win at Seattle. \nEAGLES, 22-21 \nNo. 9 Atlanta (minus 4) at No. 31 Tennessee \nFalcons will atone for loss at New Orleans by romping in Music City. \nFALCONS, 33-16 \nNo. 14 Buffalo (minus 4) vs. No. 32 Jacksonville at London \nRex Ryan at Wembley. Jolly Old England might never be the same. \nBILLS, 20-13 \nNo. 18 Dallas (plus 5 1-2) at No. 13 New York Giants \nMatt Cassel makes enough of a difference for Cowboys to stay close. \nGIANTS, 21-17 \nNo. 24 Houston (plus 4 1-2) at No. 20 Miami \nDan Campbell gets a second straight victory as interim coach. \nDOLPHINS, 26-20 \nNo. 22 Cleveland (plus 4 1-2) at No. 16 St. Louis \nBrowns have mastered close defeats. Here's another. \nRAMS, 17-16 \nNo. 10 Minnesota (minus 3) at No. 28 Detroit \nYes, Detroit showed fortitude with its OT win against Chicago. Minnesota simply is better. \nVIKINGS, 24-22 \nNo. 21 New Orleans (plus 5) at No. 11 Indianapolis \nHey, Chuck: PUNT. \nNo. 19 Oakland (plus 4) at No. 17 San Diego \nDo the Chargers have any juice left after two distressing defeats? \nCHARGERS, 28-22 \nNo. 8 Pittsburgh (OFF) at No. 29 Kansas City \nUncertainty at quarterback for Pittsburgh takes this one off the board. So ... \nSTEELERS, 23-20 with Ben Roethlisberger. \nCHIEFS, 23-13 with Landry Jones or Michael Vick or Terry Bradshaw. \nKNOCKOUT LEAGUE TIP \nLast week's pick never seems in danger of losing. With NEW ENGLAND now taken, next recommendation in the survivor sweepstakes is rebounding ARIZONA. \n2015 RECORD \nAgainst spread: Week 8-5-1, Season (49-37-2). \nStraight up: Week 10-4, Season (60-31) \nBest Bet: 4-2 against spread, 5-1 straight up. \nUpset special: 2-4 against spread, 2-4 straight up. \nPete Carroll Photo: AP Photo/Elaine Thompson \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
