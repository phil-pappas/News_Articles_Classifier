The result puts both teams at 3-1 in the league. Arkansas School for the Deaf, which Ridgway plays next Thursday, also has just one conference loss. \nTole, a senior, scored the Eagles’ first 14 points of the game, scoring a 1-yard touchdown, a two-point conversion, and a 2-yard touchdown. Jacob Lewis added the conversion after Tole’s second score to put Ridgway (3-1 overall) up 16-14 at haftime. \nLewis pushed the Eagles’ lead to 22-14 with a 54-yard burst in the third quarter before Arkansas Christian (4-1 overall) knotted the score early in the fourth. Lewis, who finished with 138 yards on 16 carries, also added the two-point conversion following the last-second TD. \nTole totaled 127 yards (75 passing, 52 rushing), three touchdowns and one interception. McMahan hauled in four of Tole’s five completions for 74 yards. \nOn defense, Tole had seven tackles and a pair of sacks. Lucas Blake added 12 tackles and two sacks. Emmanuel Young had seven tackles and a sack. \nEl Dorado 48, Sheridan 15 \nSHERIDAN — Sheridan has improved greatly this season, but El Dorado showed the Yellowjackets what it takes to be one of the top teams in the 6A-South Conference. \nNamely, don’t turn the ball over. The Wildcats fumbled twice but recovered both, while the Jackets lost four of their six fumbles in El Dorado’s 48-15 win on Friday night. \nAfter one quarter, Sheridan (3-2, 1-1) held an 8-7 lead, thanks to a Brockton Brown touchdown run and two-point conversion. El Dorado (4-1, 2-0) came back with a 20-point second quarter en route to scoring 41 straight points. \nBrown’s second TD — this one a 64-yarder in the fourth quarter — closed the scoring. He ended the night with 202 yards on 26 carries. \nIt was a far cry, though, from the 331 yards and four touchdowns El Dorado’s Kawon Love racked up on 25 carries. \nSheridan travels to face defending conference champion Benton next Friday. \nFordyce 35, Fouke 13 \nFOUKE — Jakeymes Gates accounted for every single point Fordyce scored in its 35-13 win over Fouke on Friday night. \nThe senior had four rushing touchdowns, a fumble return for a score and five extra points in the 6-3A Conference victory. \nOn the ground, Gates totaled 185 yards on 25 carries. He was helped out by Dalton Turner, who added 119 yards on 16 rushing attempts. Turner led the defense with 10 tackles. \nOn defense, Gates forced two fumbles and recovered one, taking it 60 yards for a touchdown. Fellow senior Tommy Tidwell forced and recovered a fumble, as well. \nQuarterback Ross Rogers only had to complete two passes against Fouke (3-2, 0-2) — both, of course, going to Gates for 22 yards. \nFordyce (3-2, 2-0) hosts Lake Village Lakeside next week. \nJUNIOR HIGH \nWatson Chapel 20, Maumelle 14 (OT) \nMAUMELLE — Dejuan Harris scored late in regulation to send Thursday’s game to overtime and again in the extra session to help the Watson Chapel junior high stay unbeaten in the River City Conference. \nHarris’ OT touchdown from 4 yards out gave Chapel a 20-14 lead on Maumelle. The Wildcats’ defense held firm after allowing the Hornets to reach the 1-yard on the first play of its drive to preserve the win. \nMaumelle (3-1 in conference) took an 8-0 lead in the first quarter, but Chapel (4-1, 4-0) got on the board when Treveon Goodwin sacked the opposing quarterback in the end zone for a safety. \nLineman KeKe Kendal scored on a 1-yard run in the third quarter to tie the game at 8-8. \nThe Wildcats host Sheridan this coming week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:28:30.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
