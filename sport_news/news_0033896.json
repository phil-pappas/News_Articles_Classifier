His wingspan is 7 feet. He wears a 54-long sportcoat. When he stretches out his arms and makes contact with a pass rusher, it’s a long expedition around him to get a sniff of the quarterback.\n“When I was really little my dad coached at Depew, and his football players gave me that nickname,” Kling said. “It’s kind of grown up with me.”\nKling is the anchor of the UB offensive line and is off to a good start to the 2015 season. His ideal size may give him the best shot of any senior on the UB team to continue his career as a professional next year.\n“He’s made an excellent transition from the right side to the left this year, which people don’t always appreciate,” said UB coach Lance Leipold. “That’s a reversal of footwork. He’s a quiet leader. He’s a humble young man with a great work ethic. I’d be disappointed if he doesn’t get a chance to play beyond here.”\nKling probably entered his senior year as an undrafted free-agent prospect on most NFL draft boards. The switch to left tackle, protecting Joe Licata’s blind side, gives him a better shot to impress pro scouts this season.\nMany tall college tackles bend at the waist more than the knees, which inhibits their mobility. Kling has pretty good knee bend, which he attributes to playing multiple sports in high school. He was a wrestler and a shot putter, and he also played youth hockey for many years.\n“I’ve always been pretty flexible,” he said. “I played hockey for a long time. Coming up playing all those sports and working out with the right techniques, I’ve never had a problem bending.”\nUB likes to run behind its two big tackles, Kling and right tackle Robert Blodgett. So far in pass protection, Kling has given up two sacks, one at Penn State and one to Nevada star Ian Seau. Kling was very good in pass protection against Bowling Green last week, when Licata attempted a school-record 59 passes.\nKling has worked hard on his pass-protection technique.\n“In the past year, my upper body has gotten a lot stronger than it has been, so punching as opposed to catching was a big thing I had to work on coming into the year,” he said. “I think as the year is going on I’m getting better at punching instead of catching.”\n“The big thing with speed rushers is he’s got to understand who he’s going against,” said UB offensive line coach Daryl Agpalsa. “Sometimes on speed rushers he wants to get his hands on them right now, as opposed to letting them get up the field. I think as he’s started to get comfortable moving right to left, he’s been getting better every week.”\nKling’s father, John, is a health and physical education teacher at Depew who served as an assistant high school football coach in Western New York for many years. He was head coach at St. Mary’s of Lancaster in 2008 and 2009.\n“John has the most experience in our group, and it shows on game day,” Agpalsa said. “He has a strong football IQ.”\nLike the rest of the offensive players, Kling feels good about the fact UB rolled up 500 yards on Bowling Green but not so good about the fact it went 2 of 6 on red-zone scoring chances.\n“You’ve got to watch the film and look at what you personally did during those red zone drives and correct what you did,” he said. “You’re always one block, one assignment, one play away.”\n...\nWith UB on a bye this week, Leipold and his assistants will be on the road this weekend watching high school and junior college games. ... UB’s game at Central Michigan on Oct. 17 is a 1 p.m. start. ... UB moved senior defender Kyril Threats (Canisius) from linebacker to stand-up edge rusher vs. Bowling Green. He played 10 defensive snaps.\nemail: mgaughan@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:42:29.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
