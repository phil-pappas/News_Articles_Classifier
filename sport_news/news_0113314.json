Alternatively, the Applicant has sought that the Justice Lodha Committee looks into these aspects.\"\n\"The Applicant relies upon the judgement dated 22.1.2015 passed by the Supreme Court which disallows any person who has commercial interest from contesting in the elections,\" the press release signed by Verma stated.\n\"According to the Applicant, N Srinivasan is attempting to take advantage of his enormous clout that he wields in TNCA and would ensure that TNCA nominates him to represent TNCA in the working committee meeting of the BCCI,\" said the release.
