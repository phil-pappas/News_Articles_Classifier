Pangilinan expressed satisfaction with the decision of the PBA board to allow 17 players to try out for the national team known as Gilas Pilipinas that will play in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament (OQT) next year.\n“We welcome the assistance of the PBA and thank the PBA board for its support,” said Pangilinan in a statement yesterday.\nPangilinan had earlier chided some PBA teams for not supporting Gilas in the recent FIBA Asia Championship where the country placed second, missing out on an outright berth to the 2016 Rio Olympics.\nBut the runner-up finish put the Philippines in the Olympic qualifier along with Iran and Japan as Asia’s representatives. Fifteen other countries are also in the qualifying where they will vie for three remaining berths.\nThe SBP was left in a quandary on whether to participate in the qualifying because Gilas, as presently constituted, would probably not go far in the eliminations. Because of this, the SBP made the condition that it will only participate if the PBA would back it up all the way.\nThe PBA agreed and approved all the 17 players requested by the SBP and Gilas coach Tab Baldwin from where the 12-man team will be chosen.\nPangilinan said that the SBP, through the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC), would notify right away FIBA of its intentions to field in a national team for the said OQT, which is scheduled July 5 to 10.\n“The SBP will forthwith file with FIBA, through the POC, the registration form indicating our intention to participate,” said Pangilinan.\n“May God bless the Gilas team, and our country,” added Pangilinan.\nAside from agreeing to lend its players, the PBA will also adjust its calendar for the 41st season by moving the third conference (Governors’ Cup) after the Olympic qualifier.\nThe league’s new season will officially start Sunday with the opening of the Philippine Cup, and will be followed by the Commissioner’s Cup, which will likely end in late May.\nWith PBA’s full backing, the SBP may bid to host one of three qualifying events which by itself is also a tough proposition. The initial bid as per announced by FIBA is 2 million euro, which is roughly R104 million (1 euro is R52).\nNamed by the SBP to the pool and approved by the PBA were June Mar Fajardo and Marcio Lassiter (San Miguel Beer), Greg Slaughter, Japeth Aguilar and LA Tenorio (Barangay Ginebra), Paul Lee, Jeff Chan and Gabe Norwood (Rain or Shine), Jayson Castro, Ranidel de Ocampo, Matt Ganuelas-Rosser, Ryan Reyes and Troy Rosario (Talk ‘N Text), Marc Pingris and Ian Sangalang (Star), Calvin Abueva (Alaska) and Terrence Romeo Globaport).", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:38:15.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
