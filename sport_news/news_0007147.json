(AP) - CHI Aviation is closing its operations in Galliano and will lay off 74 helicopter pilots, mechanics and support staff.\nThe Howell, Michigan-based company filed a notice with the Louisiana Workforce Commission saying the layoffs will take place over the next two months.\nThe Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1VXdhZG ) the layoffs are the latest to hit the energy industry, which has struggled to cope with low prices. Oil is trading at less than $50 a barrel, about half what it was a year ago. Experts don't expect prices to recover for another year or two.\nThe commission says CHI employees will get information on the agency's services and they're encouraged to visit their local Business and Career Solutions Center to get information on unemployment insurance and job searching tools.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
