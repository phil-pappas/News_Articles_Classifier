However, the Bobcat defense got a sack by Quentin Poling on second down and Ian Wells broke up a fourth-down pass to seal the win. \nAfter Stein staked Ohio to a 3-0 lead midway through the first quarter, Vick connected with Keith Heitzman for a 24-yard score. Early in the second Patterson scored on a 4-yard run before Stein kicked a 33-yarder three seconds before halftime. \nStein booted a 41-yard field goal late in the third quarter. \nAkron had 319 total yards to 227 for Ohio.
