At the moment, I am a player - a selfish player - and I just want to play. I would never think I didn't need to play a particular game,\" Hart was Quote: d as saying by the British media.\n\"I think everyone plays through something. You have to sometimes play through pain, otherwise there's someone very talented trying to take my place,\" he added.\nBattling a back problem, Hart said he has to control back spasms as part of his training regime.\n\"That is part of my maintenance, part of me flying around and smashing off the floor every day. That's me and every now and then it's going to happen,\" said Hart, who sat out City's 4-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sept. 26, due to the back injury.\n\"I've got fantastic staff, so it's something we are able to keep on top of.
