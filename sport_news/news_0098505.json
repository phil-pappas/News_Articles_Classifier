The intensity of this year’s game was even felt in the pre-game of Kickapoo’s homecoming as the two teams gathered in-mass near the center of the field separated by just a few yards and exchanged glares and taunts until the referees moved in-between them and waved them to the sidelines. The Chiefs then took the opening kick-off and moved 82 yards with Maverick McGee going the final 22 for a 6-0 lead after a missed extra-point. West Plains immediately countered with a 66-yard drive of their own culminated by a TD connection between Sam Hall and Gerard Dietrich that tied the game at 6-6 after the Zizzers missed their extra-point as well. But at 2:47 of the first quarter, the game-changer was turned-in by Stout as he took the ensuing kick-off and broke free 90-yards for a touchdown that gave the Chiefs the lead for good at 13-6. “On a previous kick-off I got hit early but I saw that they had everyone outside with a big gap in the middle,” Stout explained. “So the second time I just anticipated a little better. Our wedge did a nice job of blocking and I just went.” After West Plains went three-and-out, Kickapoo then got another great punt return from midfield down to the Zizzer six-yard line. And although they were pushed back to the 22-yard line, quarterback Chris Lawson hit Mason Pack for a touchdown just out of the reach of a West Plains defender for the Chiefs second touchdown in two minutes to increase their lead to 20-6 by the half. Within the first four minutes of the second half, Stout’s second touchdown of the game on a short run put Kickapoo ahead 27-6 but the seemingly insurmountable lead was about to be tested. A 13-yard touchdown pass from Zizzer quarterback Sam Hall to Ryan Martin finally got West Plains going at 1:20 of the third quarter. And with 3:59 remaining in the game, a Hall TD toss to Billy Holloway suddenly pulled the Zizzers within striking distance at 27-21. And in the stadium you could feel that the momentum had changed as fans on both sides started to think about last year. “A little bit,” Lawson replied when asked if he felt the momentum swing away from his Chiefs. “Towards the end of the third quarter I think we were a little flat. But we kept our heads high and I think we really finished the game well.” “We live for moments like that,” Stout added. “Blow-outs are fine but wins where you have to grind it out in the fourth quarter is so much sweeter. We were waiting for that opportunity and it came and thank God we were ready for the challenge.” Starting from their own 36, the Chiefs began a solid 73-yard drive to put the game-away with Stout going the final 22-yards to put Kickapoo up 35-21 with 1:54 remaining. “We knew that we really needed to score right there,” Lawson said. “We wanted to run the clock down as much as we could but still get in the end zone.” “That is what we’ve been working for,” Stout said. “A lot of us have played ball together since we were little. It’s games like this where you find out who’s got it inside of them and who doesn’t.” The Chiefs definitely had it inside of them as moments later Tre Woodring intercepted a Hall pass and returned it 42 yards for the final 42-21 margin of revenge. “It’s a good accomplishment,” Stout said of the Chiefs 7-0 start that leaves them as the number one team in their district with two games remaining. “But it’s what we expected. And we do think about what things are possible in the post-season. With those standings come high-expectations. So you can’t come out and execute poorly against a smaller-class team. So the fact that we were able to come out with a victory is very rewarding.” “It means a lot,” Lawson added. “I think it was well-deserved. It’s hard not to be excited about 7-0. It’s a big momentum shift to win that game and I think that will carry us into the final two weeks of the regular season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:39:27.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
