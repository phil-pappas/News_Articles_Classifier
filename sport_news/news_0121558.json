The Hillbillies (3-4, 1-3) were forced to punt after their first possession, but got the ball back after the Lizards’ first fumble with 9:44 remaining in the first quarter.After Ozark punted again, Dakota Roland got rolling with a run of 26 yards and a couple of first downs. That set up quarterback Elyas Carter, who threw a 42-yard touchdown strike to Chris Kershner. Temo Martiniz kicked the point-after for a 7-0 lead with 4:53 still left in the first quarter.However, the Hillbillies were forced to punt and booted a 57-yarder that backed Dardanelle up at its own 3. But it didn’t matter. Roland took the ball and scampered 97 yards to the end zone and gave the Sand Lizards a 14-0 margin after the Martiniz PAT.An option pass that wasn’t long enough resulted in Dardanelle’s second fumble and a Hillbilly touchdown. Senior quarterback Austin Wheelis found senior wideout Jaron Harris on a 27-yard scoring strike, but the PAT was blocked and left Ozark trailing 14-6.Kershner took off on a 69-yard touchdown run in response, and the Sand Lizards led 21-6 after the Martiniz PAT with 2:02 left in the first half. The Hillbillies got to the Dardanelle 4-yard line, but were pulled back by the Lizards as the second quarter came to an end.Dardanelle opened the third quarter with a fumble recovery from Ozark. Carter scored on a 4-yard run later, and Martiniz hit the PAT to make it 28-6 with 10 minutes left in the third quarter.Nearly six minutes later, Daniel Craig crossed the goal line to give the Sand Lizards a 35-6 lead after the PAT by Martiniz.Another Hillbilly turnover led to another Dardanelle touchdown, this time Carter went over the goal line from 2 yards out with 2:51 to go in the third quarter and put the AAA Mercy Rule into effect. The Sand Lizards led 42-6 after the Martiniz PAT.Dardanelle will host Pulaski Robinson next week.
