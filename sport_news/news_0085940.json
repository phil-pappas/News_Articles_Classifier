Stacy Long , Montgomery Advertiser 8:25 p.m. CDT October 12, 2015 Troy running back Brandon Burks (32) breaks the tackle of Mississippi State defensive back Jamal Peters (12) and runs for a touchdown during the second half of an NCAA college football game in Starkville, Miss., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015.

Perceptions deceived him. \nBrandon Burks, for a career-long touchdown run, had much more than a defense to escape. \nHe fought his own body and his own mind. \nThe Troy senior running back’s 74-yard touchdown run in last weekend’s 45-17 loss at Mississippi State featured two in-run cramps that made it more memorable. \n“When I was running and came up from stumbling, I said, ‘This field looks so long,’” Burks said Monday. “’Oh, my. I still have 5 yards to go.’ \n“Those last 5 yards felt like 20.” Troy running back Brandon Burks describes his career-long 74-yard touchdown run from last weekend's 45-17 loss at Mississippi State. Stacy Long \nHis teammates were (playfully) stunned. \nBurks’ previous career-long run was a pedestrian 57-yarder in this year’s season opener at North Carolina State. Last weekend’s, by comparison, was a marathon. \n“He caught me off-guard,” safety Montres Kitchens said. “I thought he was going to fall or give out, but he was still going.” \nSuch teasing is a theme with Burks, whose bubbly personality leaves several Trojans with a smile. \nHis running isn’t too shabby, either. \nBurks has six career 100-yard games and can reach second on the school’s all-time list with two more. He’s also 16th on the career rushing chart. With seven games left in the season, starting with Saturday’s home game against Idaho, Burks should reach the top 10. \n“If we would just do a good job of getting him to the line of scrimmage and keeping a hat on everybody, he’s a really good player,” Troy co-offensive coordinator Matt Moore said. “He runs real hard, and he’s so physical, so strong.” Troy offensive coordinator Matt Moore says he's been impressed at running back Brandon Burks'play this season. Stacy Long \nThe odd thing on Burks’ run against Mississippi State was that, head coach Neal Brown said, the Trojans didn’t block it very well. \nIt also wasn’t the ideal play for the defense MSU ran. \nThe Bulldogs blitzed from the side of the field where Burks was to run and he still squirmed through the traffic. A spin move helped. \nBurks even survived a stumble. \n“That was a heck of a run, made a couple of guys miss in the hole, made another guy miss,” Troy co-offensive coordinator Kenny Edenfield said. “It was a really special run.” \nBurks’ first goal when he reached Troy’s sideline was to ward off the cramps. He didn’t find out until later that it was Troy’s longest run in eight years. \nHis 74-yarder was the longest since Kenny Cattouse went 88 in a 2007 game with Florida International. \n“That run really killed me, especially my thighs with the cramps,” Burks said. “I’ve never experienced anything like that.” \nWith primary backup Jordan Chunn out with a broken collarbone, Burks’ role has been even more prominent this season. \nOf Troy’s 555 yards rushing, Burks has 405. \n“Burks is hungry,” Kitchens said. “He’s going to do whatever he can to prove himself. He’s carried a tremendous amount of weight on his back with the running game and everything on the offense.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1Lro7jO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:48:30.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
