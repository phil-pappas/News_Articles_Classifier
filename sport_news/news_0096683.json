For some reason, we go into the third period and have that mentality that every play matters.”\nGirardi, notching his 200th career point, scored the second-period winner and the Rangers rallied for a 4-1 win over the Flames on Sunday night at Madison Square Garden as backup goalie Antti Raanta earned his second victory in as many starts for his new team.\nThe Rangers (6-2-2), coming off Saturday’s 3-2 shootout loss at Philadelphia and playing for the third time in four nights, are currently on pace for a 115-point season. Last season, they finished atop the NHL standings with a franchise-record 113 points\n“We’re a work in progress,” coach Alain Vigneault said. “I don’t think anyone in the dressing room doesn’t believe there’s room for improvement in our play.”\n“Sometimes we beat ourselves down a little bit from the standard we’re used to playing,” defenseman Marc Staal added. “But we’re finding a way to win.”\nDefenseman Kevin Klein also scored a goal and Staal and captain Ryan McDonagh added assists, giving the Rangers’ blue-line corps a four-point effort. When the Rangers are playing their best, their defensemen are intricately involved in their offensive attack.\nComing into the game, the Rangers had gotten three goals and 10 assists from their defensemen.\n“It was better tonight,” Vigneault said of the offensive contribution from the defensemen, adding the key is turning turnovers into rushes with quick, first passes. “It’s coming but we’re not there yet.”\nThis couldn’t be called a 60-minute effort after a sleepy first period in which the Flames (2-6-0) scored on their first shot. But they were kept from extending the lead as Raanta (22 saves) made three saves on the Rangers’ second power play, including stopping Mikael Backlund’s short-handed breakaway and Michael Frolik’s rebound try at 17:35 of the first period.\nRaanta improved to 16-0-3 with a 1.49 goals-against average in career home appearances for the Rangers and Blackhawks. He made his Rangers’ debut with a 22-save performance in this past Monday’s 4-0 win over the visiting Sharks.\n“We were blessed with great goaltending early on,” said Vigneault, calling Raanta’s saves on Backlund and Frolik “the turning point of the game.”\nRookie Oscar Lindberg, with his team-high fifth goal, tied the game at 1 at 12:03 of the second period and Girardi made it 2-1 from low in the slot at 16:57.\nKlein and Derick Brassard added third-period goals.\n“You want to keep the game close when we are losing so it was great to make those saves,” Raanta said. “The guys started to play better and better in the second period. The guys helped me a lot, there were so many blocked shots (18).”\nBRIEF: Emerson Etem logged 11:56 with an assist in his second game for the Rangers. He was in the lineup with left wing Viktor Stalberg day to day with a head injury – the Rangers are not specifying a concussion –after taking a heavy, high hit from Flyers defenseman Radko Gudas on Saturday. Vigneault reported Stalberg was “feeling better.” Gudas was not penalized on the play and there was no indication he would face any NHL supplemental discipline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:04:41.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
