Nothing compares,\" Colohan said through pure ecstasy after the Darts clinched a 20-0 season. \"This is the best feeling in the world. I wanted it so bad for the seniors, and I'm just glad we accomplished it. I'm so happy to see them go out on top.\" \nThe BYU commit gave Davis the early lead with a thunderous blast from about 25 yards out just over 10 minutes into the match. Weber State-bound Regyn Youngberg spun and dished a backward pass to BYU commit Olivia Wade, who crossed the ball to Colohan for the goal from distance that put the Darts up 1-0 in the 11th minute. \nColohan picked up her head as she saw each Weber defender trail to defend Wade, then screamed for the ball, took the one-touch assist and buried it from the edge of the 18-yard box. \n\"These past three games where our offense wasn't clicking, and we missed chances that we made in the regular season, this was all about the defense keeping us in the game and preserving a lead for us,\" said Davis coach Souli Phongsavath after admitting he was rarely a fan of the \"defense wins championships\" cliche. \nBut the defense anchored by Baker, Cacciacarne and Stoddard made him a believer with a team that allowed just eight goals in 20 games played. \n\"No disrespect to my other teams, but this defense is definitely the best,\" said Phongsavath, who won his fourth state soccer championship with Davis and second with the girls team. \"They didn't let in any soft goals. Every goal we've had scored on us was earned, 100 percent. They were great goals. It's difficult to play in games where we are up big and still not to let up and have any lapse of focus. They just kept it.\" \nBaker said the confidence gained by the team heading into the playoffs was the biggest key to the defensive lockdown. Davis outscored its opponents 9-1 in the postseason, with the only goal coming in a 2-1 extra-time win against American Fork. It's like Christmas morning, honestly. Nothing compares. This is the best feeling in the world. I wanted it so bad for the seniors, and I'm just glad we accomplished it. I'm so happy to see them go out on top. – \nWeber's Mylee Broad nearly equalized in the 64th minute when the Warriors earned a free kick from 16 yards out just wide of the box. But her chip from the flank sailed inches over the crossbar, getting caught in the top of the netting and preserving the Darts' shutout. \nOther than that, the Warriors (15-3-2) relied on a steady diet of counterattacks that nearly toppled the Darts' leave. Weber finished the night with five shots, including three on goal, to trail Davis' nine total shots. \n\"We had plenty of chances to put the game away, and I thought if we got two we'd be pretty comfortable,\" Phongsavath said. \"We controlled the game on their end, but they're a great team and so well-coached. We just couldn't put the game away, but we'll take this win.\" \nPhongsavath stayed away from comparing this year's Davis team to any past iteration of Kaysville soccer players, simply calling the team \"special\" and mentioning the defense as the best he's coached. \nThe legacy of the 2015 Davis girls soccer team will be discussed in barbershops and Internet message boards across Northern Utah, but for one night, the Darts were on top of the world and basked in the glow of back-to-back titles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:49:39.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
