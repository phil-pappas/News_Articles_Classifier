So much so that he went Rocky Balboa on a defenseless Gatorade jug in the Pirates' dugout.\nAAAARgh!\nOf course, judging from Pirates fans' tweets before the game, few were thrilled that Rodriguez was anywhere near a do-or-die postseason game.\nWen you see that Sean Rodriguez is starting at 1B in a postseason game pic.twitter.com/G1Cxbn8rDQ\n— Marty (@martymcfly53) October 7, 2015\nHere's a look at some of the best memes from the Rodriguez vs. the orange drink container bout. Someone even synced the fight to L.L. Cool J's \"Mama Said Knock You out.\"\nSurvivor's \"Burning Heart\" probably would have been too obvious.\nAs someone who writes about pop culture, Internet memes, guys dressing up swashbucklers and video games, I thought these memes and trolls were just too goo not to share. (Full disclosure: I'm also a Cubbies fanatic who tries to make a pilgrimage to Wrigley Field every summer.)\nThe Pirates Water Cooler even has its own Twitter account now. Just awesome.\nUPDATE: Just when it looked like this story couldn't get any weird (or more awesome), Sean Rodriguez has tweeted out an elaborate, Christian-minded apology to the water cooler.\nPirates IF Sean Rodriguez says he spoke to the cooler from last night & apologized personally.
