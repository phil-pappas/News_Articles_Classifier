Will that have any bearing on the regular season? Yes and no. The “yes” is because newcomers like Nicolas Batum and Jeremy Lin have meshed so quickly with Kemba Walker, Al Jefferson and other Hornets veterans. The “no” is because the Hornets played games where they nor their opponents did any sort of game-planning or scouting of each other. How damaging will the loss of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist be? Based on how the team looked in the preseason, maybe not as bad a first thought. However, while MKG’s critics scoff at his lack of offensive skills, his defensive skills are All-NBA good. And there’s a reason the Hornets are only 15-36 when he hasn’t played in the first four years of career – and 115-157 when he has played. How has Al Jefferson looked? After missing 10 games (including one playoff game) two years ago and 17 games last season, Jefferson changed his diet and workout routine in the offseason. The result was a loss of 20 pounds and early returns are that Jefferson appears quicker, more agile and hopefully back to the third team All-NBA form he showed two seasons ago. Three starters are self-evident in Kemba Walker, Nicolas Batum and Al Jefferson. What about the other two spots? Hornets coach Steve Clifford appears to have two options here. If he goes with a smaller lineup, he can use Walker at the point, Jeremy Lin at off-guard, Batum at small forward, Marvin Williams or Cody Zeller at power forward and Jefferson at center. If he goes with a big lineup, he could use Walker at point guard, Batum at off-guard, Williams at small forward, Zeller at power forward and Jefferson at center. Even without the injured Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Clifford’s bench is far deeper than in the two previous seasons as Brian Roberts is a dependable backcourt reserve and veterans Spencer Hawes and Tyler Hansbrough and rookie Frank Kaminsky give the team a deep frontcourt. Will the Hornets make the playoffs? Hard to say at this point. Clifford and general manager Rich Cho said in the offseason they expected the team to return to the playoffs after slipping from 43-39 in 2013-14 to 33-49 last season. With the uncertainty of virtually every team in the Eastern Conference this side of the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers, simply staying healthy would be a plus. Charlotte has already suffered a season-ending injury to top defender Michael kidd-Gilchrist. And while this year’s team is deeper, it’s hard to imagine the Hornets making the postseason if Kemba Walker, Nicolas Batum and/or Al Jefferson miss significant time due to injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:10:16.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
