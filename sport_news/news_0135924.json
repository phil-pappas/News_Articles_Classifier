The ball bounded into the end zone and went over the back line for a touchback and Seattle's ball at the 20. \nRussell Wilson was sacked six times and pulled numerous escape acts, but threw a TD pass to Doug Baldwin in the first half and Steven Hauschka hit a pair of field goals from 50-plus yards as Seattle evened its record at 2-2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:22:46.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
