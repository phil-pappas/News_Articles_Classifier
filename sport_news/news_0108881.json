Comment Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 10:39 PM Cheboygan, Mich. By JARED GREENLEAF sports@cheboygantribune.com CHEBOYGAN — Playing in their first home game last week, nothing seemed to go right for the Cheboygan Chiefs in a 41-0 loss to rival Petoskey. But while the Chiefs (1-3) are clearly disappointed with the result and the way they played, they believe this week — homecoming week — could be the perfect time to turn it all around. Cheboygan, which struggled mightily in all areas during the loss to the Northmen last week, will look to get things going in the right direction quickly when they host Alpena (2-3) in their homecoming game at Western Avenue Field on Friday night at 7 p.m. “It makes you want to get out and play and get a chance and prove to yourself that you can play good and have more fun doing it,” said Cheboygan head coach Dave Schulz. “A loss like that to our kids, and also to our coaches, makes you just want to get back out there and do it again, to start feeling better about what’s going on. “We were disappointed. We thought we did some things well defensively, but we just couldn’t sustain anything on offense and struggled all night.” Like Cheboygan’s setback to the Northmen, the Wildcats are also coming off bad defeat — a 49-13 rout in favor of Traverse City West. However, the Wildcats dominated the Chiefs and cruised to a 34-12 victory in the last meeting — Alpena’s homecoming game — between the teams in 2014. Though the Wildcats have three losses this season, they feature plenty of quality on the offensive side of the ball, starting with sophomore quarterback Lars MacArthur, who has thrown for 826 yards and seven touchdowns, while also adding three rushing touchdowns, this season. MacArthur’s big targets have been senior receiver Jarid Campbell, who has 21 receptions for 310 yards and three touchdowns, and sophomore Alex Arch, who has 22 receptions for 303 yards and four touchdowns. Like Alpena teams of the past, Schulz said this year’s Wildcats feature good size and physicality up front. “This Alpena team is similar to years in the past — they have good size up front with the both lines,” Schulz said. “They also have some pretty good talent at the skill positions, good receivers. They’ve got a young quarterback (MacArthur), but he’s definitely getting the ball out and making some big plays. It’s a challenge for our defense again. It’s a little different style challenge than last week where it was so tight and power style football, and this week it’s going to be the ball spread out and kind’ve attacking all different areas on the field. Page 2 of 3 - “Offensively, it’s a challenge upfront to maintain and control the line of scrimmage. That’s where we’re really kind’ve going to make our way, is if we get off the ball, move that line scrimmage a little bit forward into the defensive territory, and that’ll give us a good shot at winning.” After the Chiefs had success offensively in games against Ogemaw and Kingsford, they took a step back against the Northmen last week. Going up against an Alpena defense that’s prone to giving up big points, Schulz believes his team can have offensive success if the running game gets going. “We definitely want to be able to maintain our ground game throughout the game, be able to execute our running attack,” Schulz said. “We’ve gotta run good, sharp routes and hit the guys when they’re open, not wait too long and hope for plays to happen. We need to go out and make them happen.” Despite not playing in the second half last week, senior Zach Socha will look to make big plays at quarterback, while junior fullback Ethan Campeau, as well as senior receivers Dylan Shampine and Dominic Reese, hope to have more of an impact this week. Trailing by a big halftime margin against the Northmen, Schulz played junior quarterback Mike Radle was the entire second half. However, Schulz said Socha is still the main signal-caller for the Chiefs. “They have the same roles they’ve had. Socha’s our quarterback,” Schulz said. “With the game the way it played out in the first half and the situation we were in, it was a good chance to give Mike (Radle) some experience, but Zach’s our leader and we’re going to count on him to make big plays this Friday.” Cheboygan’s offense will go up against Alpena’s defense, led by nose guard Tyler Erickson, the team’s lead on that side of the ball. Erickson has 24 tackles, nine tackles for loss, and seven sacks this season. Other key defensive players for the Wildcats include Joe Ayala and Barrett Jones, the team’s leading tacklers. The Chiefs’ defense, meanwhile, will lean on junior defensive tackle Jack Ormsbee, who continues to impress this season after a 12-tackle performance last week. Campeau and junior Zane Beydoun, two of the team’s linebackers, have also showed progress, recording 13 tackles apiece against the Northmen. Even after giving up a plethora of points to the Northmen, Schulz said the defense is showing positive signs. “They want to make plays and be the best that they can, and the defensive line is doing a pretty good job, and I think our linebackers are doing a better job of attacking the line of scrimmage and making it difficult for running backs and quarterbacks to make yards,” Schulz said. “We’re very excited about them, we just have to bring along the other parts of the game, the offense and special teams. If we do that, we’re a better team.” Page 3 of 3 - The Chiefs, who hammered Sault Ste. Marie last fall, will look to have more homecoming success on Friday night. With many Cheboygan alums likely to be home watching the game, Schulz is looking forward to the homecoming contest and weekend. “I think the homecoming game brings everybody in the school together, because everybody can kind of find their piece, find their niche where they’re excited about, they feel like they got a role in the week,” Schulz said. “So just bringing everybody together that Friday night for the game and Saturday night for the dance. It’s just a great time for the school and all the families that get involved in the community.” WCBY Radio will carry the Alpena-Cheboygan football game on Friday.
