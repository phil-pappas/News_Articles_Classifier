How about Vic Fangio as the best defensive coordinator? How about Adam Gase as the best offensive coordinator?\nAll are in their first season with the Bears and already indicating that this is the franchise's most professional coaching staff in decades.\nYes, we're getting overly giddy here, but these have been 2 exciting victories in two weeks â€¦ and also unexpected.\nNo, the Bears aren't a great team but as Fox said, this \"was a very gutsy, good-character victory.\"\nLast week the Bears beat the Raiders by 2 points. This week they beat the Chiefs by 1 point. Next week, well, they might beat the Lions in overtime.\nWhatever happens at Detroit, give credit to Fox, who for a while seemed like he would be known best around here for strange answers to familiar questions.\nNow Fox looks like the savvy veteran coach he's supposed to be while maneuvering a roster that includes names like Mitch Unrein, Khari Lee, Cameron Meredith, Nick Becton, Lamin Barrow, LeRoy Reynolds and Thomas Gafford.\nYou probably wouldn't recognize any of them if they spilled beer on you in Wrigleyville after a Cubs playoff victory.\n\"New people in new positions,\" is the way running back Matt Forte described the Bears' lineup.\nFox kept this odd brew of Bears together, focused and spirited as they started 0-3.\nThe Bears' coach isn't nearly as engaging as Cubs manager Joe Maddon, but right now it's difficult to argue with his methods or the results.\nNow let's move on to Fangio, who has breathed life into what figured to be a terrible Bears defense for the third straight year.\nThe Chiefs aren't the most dynamic offense with quarterback Alex Smith, a career game manager. But the Bears did hold them to their lowest point total of the season.\nThe biggest defensive play of the day was the stop that forced the Chiefs to punt the ball to the Bears with 2:04 left in the game.\nIn the past that likely would have been a first down that ended the Bears' chances.\nThat's where Gase's work entered the equation.\nFor the second straight week, Jay Cutler directed a two-minute drive that culminated in the winning score.\nIt appears that Gase is on the way to doing what other quality offensive coordinators couldn't: turn Cutler into a legitimate NFL quarterback.\nThe Bears prevailed again after injuries left Cutler surrounded by a patchwork offensive line and inexperienced corps of wide receivers.\n\"I couldn't be more pleased,\" Fox said, \"with the way (Cutler) has handled himself since we've been here.\"\nRight back at you, coach.\nBears fans have to be pleased with the way the coaching staff fashioned a 2-3 record that wouldn't be shocking at 1-4 or even 0-5.\nmimrem@dailyherald.com\nShare this page Tweet This article filed under: Columnists Sports NFL Bears Imrem, Mike Football Pro Sports Pro Men", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-12T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:22:07.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
