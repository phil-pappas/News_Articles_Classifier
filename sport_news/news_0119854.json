(AP) — Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles will miss the remainder of the season with a torn ACL in his right knee.The star running back hurt his knee in the third quarter of Sunday's loss to Chicago. An MRI on Monday confirmed the tear.Earlier Monday, coach Andy Reid said \"the worst case is the ACL is torn. That's probably the direction it's heading.\"Charles was making a cut deep in Bears territory on Sunday when his right knee buckled at a gruesome angle. The four-time Pro Bowl selection needed help from a trainer and linebacker Justin Houston to get off the field, never once putting any weight on the leg.Charles tore the ACL in his other knee four years ago, missing most of the season.———AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP—NFL More Stories About: NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:15:58.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
