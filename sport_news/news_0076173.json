Their practical mission was one of spoiler as they traveled to face the Tampa Bay Rowdies. \nEntering weekend play, the Rowdies were two points behind the Fort Lauderdale Strikers for the fourth and final playoff berth. Meanwhile Carolina trailed the Strikers by six points and a goal differential of 15, the first tiebreaker. In other words, the RailHawks were playing for pride and (reportedly) a new boss. \nWhile neither side advanced the sport of soccer Saturday night at Al Lang Stadium in St. Petersburg, Fla., the Rowdies accomplished their aim, grinding out a 1-0 victory over the RailHawks that leapfrogged them into the final NASL playoff position entering next weekend’s regular season finales. \nThe only notable change in the RailHawks’ starting XI was backup goalkeeper Hunter Gilstrap getting the nod over Akira Fitzgerald, who leads the league in both saves and goals allowed (which tells us more about the RailHawks’ fragmented back line than Fitzgerald). \nThe Rowdies grabbed the advantage in the 12th minute. A limp RailHawks clearance fell to the feet of Richie Menjivar loitering 30 yards from goal. The Rowdies’ midfielder took two casual touches before uncorking a knuckleball that creeped between the left post and Gilstrap’s tardy mitt for a 1-0 lead. \nThe rest of the opening stanza saw both teams withstanding promising chances posed by their opposites. Carolina enjoyed seven free kicks and two corners in the first half, but it didn’t put a single shot on frame. Meanwhile, Gilstrap redeemed his gift to Menjivar with five terrific saves to keep the visiting ‘Hawks a goal down at intermission. \nUnfortunately, the second half saw both sides pad their profiles in poor finishing. The RailHawks finished with 13 free kicks and the majority of possession. Both teams took 30 shots between them for the match, 15 on target. Yet the single early goal from Menjivar proved the game-winner. \nNeedless to say, the RailHawks (8-8-13, 32 pts.) are now officially eliminated from playoff contention. The Rowdies (10-9-10, 39 pts.) reclaim their stake in the final playoff spot, one point clear of the Strikers, who lost tonight at Indy Eleven. \nCarolina finishes their 2015 regular season road campaign with just two wins out of 15 games, both away victories coming in the spring season. In the fall season alone, the RailHawks amassed a putrid 0-1-9 road record while being outscored 26-9. \nThe RailHawks finish their 2015 season next Friday, Oct. 30 in Cary against Indy Eleven. The event has been designated as Fan Appreciation Night, including post-fame fireworks and maybe, just maybe a big announcement. \nBOX SCORE CAR: Gilstrap, Low, Tobin, Danso, Miller, Pérez (Thompson, 74’), Osaki (Catic, 82’), Shipalane, da Luz, Engel (Jackson, 46’), Novo TBR: Pickens, Sweat, Antonijevic, Mkandawire, Balchan, Chavez, Menjivar, Espinal, King, Adu (Saragosa, 90’), Hristov (Santos, 60’) \nGOALS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:39:41.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
