With one exception, the setup for this year’s contest is exactly the same as it was for last year’s meeting. \nThe lone difference is the site of the game. Last year, when Cleburne County won 34-20 to clinch the regional title, the game was played in Heflin. The Tigers will travel to Saks Friday. \n“They’re very athletic as they always are. They’ve got great speed at every position,” Tigers head coach Michael Shortt said of the Wildcats. \nOne difference in this year’s version of the Wildcats is their passing attack. \n“They’re throwing the ball a lot better this year than they have the past couple of years,” Shortt noted. “That makes them even more dangerous because the way they’re throwing the ball you can’t load up on the run. That’s something we have got to be prepared for.” \nNeither Cleburne County nor Saks has been forced to play its starting lineup for four full quarters in recent games. Shortt said the team that responds best to added time on the field for starters will have a significant advantage. \n“They’re extremely fast. We’re going to have to play great assignment football,” Shortt concluded. \nCleburne County (6-1) moved its region record to 5-0 by defeating Sardis 35-13 on the road last Friday. \n“Our defense kept us in good field position,” Shortt said. “All in all, I felt good about the way we blocked because they’re real good up front. They’re real strong and big up front and we needed to face a team like that before playoff time comes around.” \nNeither team scored in the opening 12 minutes of play but the Tigers were on the move when the first quarter ended. Early in the second quarter, Trevor Houston capped a 68-yard march with a 2-yard scoring run. Macain Carlile added the extra point and Cleburne County led 7-0. \nAlong the way, Jeremiah Blake had a 39-yard pass reception from Brock Swafford, Swafford ran for 10 yards and Json Henson had a 12-yard carry as the Tigers overcame penalties. A 14-yard gain on a reception by Jake Lee got the ball to the 2-yard line and Houston scored on the next play. \nMidway through the second quarter, Sardis completed a touchdown pass and knotted the score at 7-7. Cleburne County answered with a 54-yard drive in six plays. A pass to Nick Dunston got eight yards and Kade Clark had a 9-yard run ahead of Chad Brown’s 24-yard reception to the 1 and Henson scored from there. Carlile’s kick put the Tigers ahead 41-7. \nJust before the half, the Tigers blocked a punt and Blake appeared to score when he took a screen pass 45 yards but a block in the back negated the touchdown and the score remained 14-7 at the half. \nThe third quarter kickoff went to Cleburne County. On the second snap, Swafford and Blake combined on a 58-yard touchdown pass. The kick missed but the Tigers led 20-7. \nAfter the teams traded possessions, Blake intercepted a pass by Sardis and converted the pick into a 45-yard interception return touchdown. \n“Defensively, we met one of our goals we hadn’t met. We’d been causing a lot of turnovers. We just hadn’t scored on defense. We finally scored the other night on defense and that was pleasing,” Shortt said of Blake’s interception and score. \nSwafford then passed to Mario Smith for a 2-point conversion and a 28-7 lead. \nSardis punted again and the Tigers quickly moved 85 yards for their final touchdown. \nHenson ran for 31 yards on first down. After a holding penalty on the Tigers’ second play, Noah Ware got a handoff on the fourth play of the series and didn’t stop until he crossed the Lions’ goal line. Ware’s burst covered 58 yards. Carlile’s kick made it 35-7. \nTrailing 35-7 when the third quarter ended, Sardis got its final touchdown on a 63-yard pass play. \n“I felt good with the way we played the second half,” Shortt said. \nThe Tigers ended with 422 yards of total offense on a nice balance of 192 yards rushing and 230 yards passing. \nHenson ran 12 times for 67 yards. Ware gained 63 yards on two carries. \nClark had 24 yards on seven runs and Houston finished with 17 yards on four tries. \nSwafford completed 11 of his 17 passes for 230 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Blake caught four passes for 113 yards. Lee had three receptions for 54 yards. Dunston’s two catches went for 36 yards. Brown had a 24-yard catch and Smith ended with three yards on one catch. \nSmith led the defensive effort with 11 tackles. Austin Harler made 10 stops. Brown had seven tackles and Ware ended with five tackles. Wade Dasinger and Christian Hartley each recorded four tackles. In addition to his interception, Blake made three tackles as did Matt Norton and Josh Davis. \nColton Austin had an interception and two tackles. Colt Funderburk, Skye Jarrell and Chase Austin each made two tackles. Bulldogs have a week of rest \nPlaying in a seven-team region means each team in the region has an open date. This week is Ranburne’s turn to watch someone else play from the stands. The bye week seems to have come at a good time for the Bulldogs. Ranburne has continued to practice this week to stay sharp but has avoided a lot of contact and won’t practice Friday. \n“I think it gives us a chance to maybe nurse some bumps and bruises and get some rested legs,” said Bulldogs coach Chad Young. “That’s what we’re trying to do.” \nIt’s also convenient for the Bulldogs to be able to rest up and heal up just before they complete Class 2A, Region 5 action when they host arch-rival Woodland on Oct. 23. \nLast Friday at New Site, Ranburne (6-1, 4-1) downed Horseshoe Bend 44-7. \n“They couldn’t do much against us. We played pretty good against the run after we had a little busted play on defense,” Young said. “They scored on a toss sweep early but they didn’t scratch much after that.” \nThe Bulldogs moved 70 yards in four plays after taking the opening kickoff. An 18-yard run by Dalton Wiggins finished the drive but the extra point attempt was blocked. \nHorseshoe Bend used the aforementioned toss sweep to take a 7-6 lead. \nLate in the first quarter, the Bulldogs began another scoring drive. A 49-yard run by quarterback Dylan Wiggins took the ball deep into the Generals’ territory and Jake Howle finished the 11-play drive with a 25-yard field goal early in the second quarter. \nA fumble recovery by Bailey McCormick at the Horseshoe Bend 42-yard line set up a 34-yard touchdown run by Dylan Wiggins and Howle’s kick made it 16-7. \nThe Generals punted, Ranburne lost the ball on a fumble then Horseshoe Bend backed the Bulldogs up to their 9-yard line with a punt. \nNo field position? No problem! Eleven plays later, Owen Smith scored on a 35-yard pass from Dylan Wiggins to complete the 91-yard drive. Wiggins also contributed a 19-yard run and a 14-yard pass to Logan Otwell to the drive. Howle kicked the extra point for a 23-7 lead and the score remained 23-7 at halftime. \nThe Generals couldn’t get anything going after receiving the second half kickoff and were forced to punt. On first down from the Horseshoe Bend 44, Smith nabbed a pass for a 15-yard gain. Four plays later, Dylan Wiggins scored on a 13-yard run. On the second play of the fourth quarter, Dylan Wiggins completed his night with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Landon Woodard at the end of a 43-yard drive. \nLater in the fourth, Ranburne reserves put together a 13-play touchdown march. A 15-yard pass from Jordan English to Aaron Benefield, an 18-yard run by English and an 18-yard run by Jordan Beal set the stage for Beal’s 1-yard scoring run. Howle, 3-for-3 on extra points in the second half, finished the scoring. \nDylan Wiggins and Dalton Wiggins each had 100-yard games rushing. Dylan picked up 122 yards on six carries. Dalton ran 13 times for 100 yards. Benefield got 32 yards on eight carries. English netted 25 yards on four carries and Beal ended with 21 yards on three rushing attempts. \nDylan Wiggins was 11-for-19 passing for 163 yards and English was 2-for-2 for 23 yards. Smith ended with five receptions for 104 yards. Otwell had two catches for 22 yards and Dalton Wiggins two for 20 yards. Benefield picked up 15 yards on one reception, Woodard 14 yards on one, Asa Fordham eight yards on one and Josh Ralston three yards on one catch. \n“We threw a good bit. They struggled in the films that we saw defending any kind of passing attack much but we also broke some long runs on some stuff, too,” Young said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:45:09.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
