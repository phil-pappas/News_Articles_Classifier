The clinic in Kunduz was bombed by U.S. forces on Oct. 3.\nThe charity, also known by its French acronym MSF, said that the corpses were found in the debris of the destroyed hospital buildings and \"have not been identified.\" They may include one staffer and two patients still missing and presumed dead, it said.\nThe bombing happened as Afghan forces with U.S. air support battled to retake Kunduz from Taliban fighters who overran the city on Sept. 28 and held it for three days.\nTwo military inquiries and an Afghan government probe are investigating why the hospital was bombed.\nThe head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John F. Campbell has said the hospital was bombed by mistake after Afghan forces requested an air strike. President Barack Obama has apologized.\nMSF has demanded an independent inquiry into the incident, saying the hospital was deliberately bombed numerous times over the course of an hour after 2 a.m. on Oct. 3.\nThe main building was destroyed and the hospital has been shut down. MSF has said it is unsure when it will be able to resume operations in Kunduz.\nOn Saturday, NATO said it was continuing its inquiry into the bombing and had appointed three U.S. military officers from outside the chain of command to handle the investigation to ensure impartiality.\nCampbell had appointed U.S. Army Maj. Gen. William Hickman and two brigadier generals to continue the investigation begun by Brig. Gen. Richard Kim, NATO said in a statement.\nThe results of the NATO investigation had been expected last week but appear to have been held up by difficulties in identifying the remains of bodies in the hospital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:42:27.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
