The FBI notified Gary police that the remains were not linked to the DNA of missing 2-year-old King Walker’s mother. On July 25, he disappeared from his Gary home with Diamond Bynum, his mentally disabled aunt, officials say.\nChicago Police are investigating a possible DNA link between the remains and Kyrian Knox, a 2-year-old boy who was reported missing in Rockford on Sept. 17.\nPolice have said they think the toddler was last seen around Aug. 20.\nRockford police have said a DNA sample of Kyrian’s mother was sent to the FBI to test for a possible match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:49:04.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
