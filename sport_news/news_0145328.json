But the pace of that acceleration is slowing as semiconductor features approach the atomic scale, adding complexity to chip engineering.\nIn July, Intel said its 24-month upgrade cycle will now take 30 months to accommodate the new challenges.\nAn October 30 industry panel at Mentor Graphics' headquarters in Wilsonville will look at forthcoming innovations, smaller feature sizes and new production tools. The event will feature executives from Intel, IBM, industry supplier ASML along with Mentor CEO Wally Rhines.\nAdmission is $75, or $55 for members of the trade group SEMI. The panel begins at 8 a.m.; register here .\n-- Mike Rogoway\nmrogoway@oregonian.com\n503-294-7699\n@rogoway", "external_links": ["http://www.semi.org/en/node/57196?utm_source=MagnetMail&utm_medium=email&utm_term=mrogoway@oregonian.com&utm_content=Pacific%20Northwest%20100515&utm_campaign=Explore%20the%20Future%20of%20Moore%27s%20Law%20at%20the%20SEMI%20Pacific%20Northwest%20", "https://twitter.com/rogoway"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:20:18.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
