El Paso embarked on a $1.5 million, five-year expansion.\nIt’s something New Mexico had been prescient enough to consider back in 2006. Then, the state offered the feds $1.5 million to increase customs inspection hours at Santa Teresa, but the enabling federal legislation was not in place at that time.\nNow that it is, it would be better late than never for New Mexico legislators, government officials and business leaders to collaborate on funding infrastructure and staffing needs and seize the opportunities these improvements would bring.\nEl Paso’s bigger border crossing processes six extra hours of traffic daily, running from 6 a.m. to midnight, while Santa Teresa’s more convenient northbound cargo lane is only open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nIn business – and especially the import-export world – time is money. It is past time for New Mexico to forge profitable partnerships that expand its border hours.\nThis editorial first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal. It was written by members of the editorial board and is unsigned as it represents the opinion of the newspaper rather than the writers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:24:31.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
