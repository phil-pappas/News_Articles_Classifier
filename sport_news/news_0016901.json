The ref was not even close to it.” \n“Yes, he had to jump away,” Lahyani responded. “What can you do these days?” Kyrgios asked. \nThe violation came at a critical time with the Australian serving at 4-5 in the second set. He dropped his serve at love, losing the set. He went on to lose the match, too, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4. \nLater, a much calmer Kyrgios said he didn’t think he behaved badly. “I didn’t hit the ball in anger. I just hit it. Obviously it was pretty close to the line umpire. It wasn’t out of rage or anything.” \nKyrgios has been under scrutiny since he made comments to Wawrinka in Montreal about his friend, fellow Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis, having slept with Wawrinka’s girlfriend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:23:28.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
