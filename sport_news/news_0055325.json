Their silver helmets bobble enthusiastically — or perhaps distractedly — as he calls the shots. They take a knee while he runs the old quarterback snap exchange drill a few times for good measure.\nThe 6-year-old Pop Warner Tiny Mite Tri-Town Raiders take a water break and No. 80 heads over to the bench — a big old log where the parents sit and watch the practice — and pulls off the silver helmet revealing her long pretty blonde hair and smudgy cheeks.\n\"I have a good arm,\" said Helen Weber, 6, not bragging, just stating a fact to explain her female presence on this typically male playing field.\nThe coach agrees. \"She can throw a football like a 10-year-old,\" Williams said.\nHelen, a big sister to 3-year-old Henry and a first grader at Homan Elementary School in Schererville, was playing defense against a form of childhood cancer called ganglioneuroblastoma only four years ago.\nGift of a piano makes 6-year-old cancer patient's heart sing Donna Vickroy Even before ports and chemotherapy and a succession of doctors and nurses, Liliana Cordova was a shy, introspective child.\nTreatment for a rare form of leukemia has made her even more so.\nBut when the tiny 6-year-old opened the front door of her Oak Lawn home one recent Wednesday afternoon and...\nEven before ports and chemotherapy and a succession of doctors and nurses, Liliana Cordova was a shy, introspective child.\nTreatment for a rare form of leukemia has made her even more so.\nBut when the tiny 6-year-old opened the front door of her Oak Lawn home one recent Wednesday afternoon and...\n(Donna Vickroy) \"It's a tumor that arises in children from the nervous system,\" said David Waterhouse, Helen's pediatric oncologist with Ann & Robert Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.\nHelen had two surgeries to remove the tumors from her spine and abdomen.\nShe did not need chemotherapy or radiation to treat the disease, according to Walterhouse.\nThe journey from diagnosis to touchdowns was long and worrisome for her parents.\n\"We first started noticing something was wrong when she was about 11 months old. We went to doctor after doctor,\" said Helen's mother, Christina Weber, a dentist and owner of the Highland Dental Clinic.\n\"It hurt her when we would take her on a wagon ride,\" said her dad, George Weber, a pharmacist for Wal-Mart. Helen wouldn't sit in a chair because the tumors — undiagnosed at the time — made it painful for her to sit at a 90-degree angle.\nBy the time she was 23 months old, doctors were able to make the ganglioneuroblastoma diagnosis. The surgeries followed.\n\"The fact they were able to treat her without chemotherapy and radiation was huge,\" said Christina Weber.\nThree weeks after her surgeries, Helen was walking again. Four years later, she's playing quarterback for the Tri-Town Raiders, a team that is 6-1 going into the Pop Warner Tiny Mite Division Super Bowl against the formidable North Lake team.\n\"I wanted to play. I love tackling and I love kicking the balls. I love football,\" said Helen.\nCancer survivor Bennett Curtis of Benet turns into a Shining Star Matt Le Cren With all the emphasis put on sports these days, young athletes sometimes have to be reminded that a game is just a game.\nBut when Benet's boys soccer team hosts Notre Dame on Saturday morning, it will be much more than that for Bennett Curtis.\nIn fact, soccer will be secondary to what Curtis has...\nWith all the emphasis put on sports these days, young athletes sometimes have to be reminded that a game is just a game.\nBut when Benet's boys soccer team hosts Notre Dame on Saturday morning, it will be much more than that for Bennett Curtis.\nIn fact, soccer will be secondary to what Curtis has...\n(Matt Le Cren) \"Hey Helen, let's go,\" calls Coach Dan from the field. She puts on her silver helmet and slips the mouthpiece in her mouth as she runs back into action.\nWhile Christina Weber said she's not a big football fan, she did not have the heart to tell Helen she couldn't play.\n\"George is such a football fan. He throws to her and she passes back. A lot of it has to do with her dad,\" Christina Weber said.\n\"She's got a great arm,\" said George Weber.\nWhile the team takes a lap around the big field, Coach Dan takes a moment to talk about Helen and the 21 members of her team — 18 of whom have never played prior to this season.\n\"We lost one game and we almost won that one. We held them the whole second half,\" said Williams. \"She's the most talented girl I ever saw. They've all got big hearts, but she's got the biggest heart on the team. I'm thoroughly proud of everything she does. She works hard and she has fun. She's all around. She's played offense and defense, quarterback, line or defense. She's great at all of it.\"\nThough Walterhouse was not aware that Helen was playing football, he didn't seem surprised.\n\"I know she's always been a star patient,\" he said.\nChristina Weber said Helen is pretty good at a few sports and when the Pop Warner season ends, Helen will probably play basketball.\nNancy Coltun Webster is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune.\nCopyright © 2015, Post-Tribune Cancer Tameka Cottle Dan Williams Cancer", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56213030/turbine/ct-sta-piano-donation-child-cancer-st-1016-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56045d85/turbine/ct-nvs-boys-soccer-benet-bennett-curtis-st-0925-20150924", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562ce8fb/turbine/ct-ptb-weber-football-girl-st-1021-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:06:43.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
