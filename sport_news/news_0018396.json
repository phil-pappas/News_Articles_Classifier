(Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images) \nThe Cleveland Browns have something special in wide receiver Travis Benjamin, who caught six passes for 83 yards off 12 targets in an overtime win against the Ravens on Sunday. He now owns the team lead in targets. \nBenjamin also leads the team in total yards from scrimmage (411) and touchdowns (four) through five weeks, but three of his those touchdown receptions came with Johnny Manziel under center, and isn’t being used as a deep threat by Josh McCown too often. \nBut even if that changed, it is unlikely to produce much in Week 6 against the Denver Broncos. \nThe Broncos have allowed the fourth-lowest yards per game to the opposing team’s top wideout (65.1 yards per game) and the lowest amount of fantasy points per game to the position. \nDenver’s two stellar cornerbacks — Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib (who is questionable with an ankle injury) — are both capable of shutting down the Brows’ passing attack, allowing a 55.5 and 65/5 rating against in primary coverage this season. \nDon’t risk it this week.
