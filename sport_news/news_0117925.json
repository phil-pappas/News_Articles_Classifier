Among distinguished alums, the Sun-Times editorial page editor, Tom McNamee, is a Bogan graduate.\nStagg Field? Named for one of the fathers of the game, Amos Alonzo Stagg.\nBut the point here is that a young man is gone far too soon, killed while doing something we not only sanction but promote. Citizens have to wonder once more — if we ever stopped wondering — what the beloved American game of football has to do with the betterment of our society. We have to wonder if it is, perhaps, mainly about entertainment, atavism and the exploitation of children who will do dangerous things at our schools because we let them.\nIt appears that Smith was hit with a helmet-to-helmet blow on the final play of the game, a kick return of no consequence. (This is not to imply there is any play in football worth dying for.) His family says he had massive swelling of the brain, though, at this moment, the official cause of death has not been determined.\nBut Smith’s demise had to do with football — that much is clear. Remember, at just 17 years old.\nDo you remember when you were 17? When you most likely were a nutty, confused, exuberant, irrational, wonderful, stupid senior in high school — with your whole adult life before you?\n‘‘I don’t know what to do,’’ Andre’s brother, Erick Smith, said on ABC-7 TV news, as he started to cry. ‘‘It just killed everything inside of me.’’\nWhose fault is this tragedy, if anybody’s?\nSmith reportedly is the seventh high school football player to die from injuries suffered during a game this year. Is that an OK risk for young men who will do crazy things anyway, who adore this violent game — as Smith, who wanted to walk on in college, did — who are just part of the more than 1 million boys, and, yes, girls, who play high school football annually?\nAnd, even more important, do we really know the true risk of playing football? Seven deaths — one per week — out of a million high school players, thousands of games, during the 2015 season. Is that such a big deal?\nBut what if those numbers aren’t even close to the real magnitude of damage this sport causes? We know about the chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in the wasted brains of many dead NFL players. We know about Junior Seau and Dave Duerson and other brain-damaged veteran NFL players who killed themselves.\nBut we don’t know much about injuries at the grass-roots level of football. Indeed, that we let 7-year-olds play tackle ball, while ignoring the possibly permanent and progressive trauma from doing so, is so myopic and cruel that it’s outrageous there is no law against it.\n‘‘It’s crazy trying to figure this all out,’’ says Matt Chaney, a Missouri sports journalist, former college defensive end and author of Spiral of Denial: Muscle Doping in American Football , speaking of high school deaths. ‘‘There are so many indirect deaths that it’s hard to make any statement. But just from newspaper files, I know there are way more.’’\nChaney has spent years collecting the relatively primitive and uncategorized football trauma stories from sources all over the country. Nobody else is doing it thoroughly. Certainly not any government agency or charity or medical clearinghouse.\n‘‘Beyond the violent, vicious deaths, we don’t hear much,’’ Chaney says. ‘‘They aren’t even reported. But I feel pretty confident there are dozens of deaths each year that are indirectly related to football.\n‘‘Cardiac arrest at home for some of these kids — cardiac arrest caused by impact, doctors are finding out, that might have been delayed for days, weeks, even months after the initial blow. Heat stroke is very hard to prove, but it can destroy organs.\n‘‘Listen, there are upwards of 100,000 surgical wounds in high school ball, with a 100 percent injury rate down to minor injuries. I find about 20 students each year who commit suicide or O.D. on drugs while playing football. Some of them have to be related to football, because painkillers became addictive, or because of head trauma.’’\nNo, it’s still America’s prep game, despite random tragedies like Andre Smith.\nIt’s a macho, jubilant, coming-of-age sport.\nFor now.\nFollow me on Twitter @ricktelander\nEmail: rtelander@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:35:52.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
