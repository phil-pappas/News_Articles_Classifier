The higher the score, the more closely a product abides by its claims.\"\nClear Food listed Butterball, McCormick, Echrick and Hebrew National among the top-rated brands.\nNo matter how you serve it - slaw, sauerkraut, mustard, relish or chili - the hot dog remains a staple of the American culinary experience.\nPeople in the U.S. spent $2.5 billion on hot dogs in supermarkets last year, according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council .\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
