Either the Rams are going to do it or another team later on says, 'Hey, forget him. We're just going to punt it to him and try to let him win the game,' but hopefully, going to Sunday, they punt me the ball.\" \nAfter a down year in 2014 while working his way back from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in October of 2013, Benjamin has learned the importance of making every play count on the field. \n\"Finish, finish,\" Benjamin said of what the team needs to do to win close games. \"Knowing that we just have to stay on the field and get some type of points out of those drives when it's close and not give the other team momentum to swing and they get points, it's all about the finish.\" \nSunday's matchup with the Rams could feature explosive punt returns as the Browns have Benjamin and St. Louis counters with speedy wide receiver Tavon Austin, who has returned seven punts an average 17.3 yards and has a 75-yard touchdown to his credit. \n\"Both guys are dynamic,\" Browns special-teams coordinator Chris Tabor said. \"I think Tavon is second in the league right now. I think Travis is fourth in the league. Both have explosive speed, can make you miss. They both catch the ball well, very comparable, very comparable. They even both obviously wear No. 11, so it goes right down to the jersey number.\" \nBenjamin added, \"He's a great guy, and I'm pretty sure Marlon (Moore) and (Johnson) Bademosi are going to try their best to get down there and go and get him as a special-teams unit. I just have to match his intensity. They're home, and I'm sure he's going to try to pump up his crowd. When we're on punt return, I have to try and do the same thing.\" \nBenjamin has already eclipsed his single-season career bests for receptions, yards, receiving touchdowns and is seven yards away from matching his best year as a punt returner, 2013, and he could not have picked a better time to do so, as it is the final year of his contract with the Browns. \nBut to Benjamin, a native of Belle Glade, Florida, whom the Browns selected with a fourth-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, he is focused on doing what he can to make Cleveland a winning franchise. \n\"I love it here, my wife loves it here and we're just happy to be here,\" Benjamin said. \n\"I'm really not paying attention to (free agency) right now. My mind and focus is just keep going to every game and just put on my best performance. At the end of the day or end of the year, the dice may roll where they roll. I'm not looking for that. Me and the Browns have a great relationship. I love them, they love me and I love the community, so if we get a deal done, that'll be great for me.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1S0T5jT TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:08:06.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
