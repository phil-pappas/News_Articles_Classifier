Corbin McGuire/Gazette Madison sweeps through home triangular By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nMadison’s volleyball team secured two victories in its home triangular Tuesday, and the Bulldogs did so in rare fashion. \nMadison topped both Southern Coffey County (25-16, 25-8) and Hartford (25-19, 25-13) in two sets. It marked the first time the Bulldogs had swept their way through a triangular this season. \n“We communicated more, we worked on coverage a lot more,” Madison senior Allyson Bond said. “We’re talking a lot more, basically that is what’s going better.” \nMadison opened up against SCC, with the first set encompassing a series of back-and-forth runs. A 6-0 run from the Bulldogs separated them from a 10-10 tie. Calli Dannels recorded multiple aces in the run that she started with a block at the net. \nSCC pulled within four but wouldn’t get any closer as the Bulldogs finished the set with a 5-1 spurt. \n“We had some good momentum at times,” Madison’s Tori Melton, another senior, said. “Sometimes we were a little more comfortable and tried to coast through, but then at the end we’re looking at the score and we’re like ‘OK, we got to go,’ and we bring it up again.” \nMadison jumped to a 6-2 advantage in the second set and would lead 9-6 before really taking control. The Bulldogs scored nine of the next 10 points to take an 18-7 lead. Once its run ended, Madison immediately regained serve, which Bond finished the set on to take the sweep. \n“We definitely worked together a lot more than we usually do. Our hits were in, we were swinging hard,” Melton said. “We had some great passes, Allyson had some greats sets and everything just worked really good today and we all were working together.” \nAgainst Hartford, Madison jumped to an 8-4 lead on one of Emily Rayburn’s many kills on the night. Dannels extended the Bulldogs’ lead to 12-6 with a kill before Hartford began to claw its way back. \nThe Jaguars cut Madison’s lead to 15-12, but Rayburn sparked a 3-0 swing with another kill to put the Bulldogs back up six. The lead served as plenty of cushion to take the win, with Makenna Farrow capping the set with a kill. \n“I think that our passes were a lot better to where Allyson could set them up and we could get a could swing on them instead of being tentative and trying to tip it over,” Melton said of the Bulldogs’ aggressive hitting. \nMadison, much like in its first match, controlled its second set against Hartford withou many issues. The Bulldogs turned a 6-4 advantage into a 10-point lead with a 10-2 run. Hartford couldn’t rally from its sizable deficit and Rayburn ended the night with a powerful kill. \n“I think we do better when we have a game first to warm up and we have more energy,” Bond said of her team’s second set success. “Our crowd is more involved and I think that’s helping a lot.” \nMadison, now 9-16 on the season and 3-3 in the Lyon County League, hosts Burlingame next Tuesday before next weekend’s LCL Tournament in Emporia. \nA 2-0 night, Bond said, is a good building block toward the season’s final stretch. \n“It can put us in really good LCL standing and for the tournament we’ll be in a better place,” Bond said. “And we’ll have more confidence going into tournament.” \nHartford topped the SCC in two sets (25-18, 25-23), finishing the night 1-1. \nThe Jaguars pulled away in the first set on a 10-4 run and they scored the final three points to end it, with Sierra Gould recording a kill for game point. \nThe second set was much more back and forth. Hartford jumped to a 5-2 lead, but allowed three straight to even the score. A 4-0 spurt put the Jaguars in control again, but they would find themselves tied once more at 10-10. \nSCC would eventually take the lead at 17-16, but consecutive kills from Lindsey Stuck evened it back up at 18. Stuck then followed a kill from Dakota Wilson to give Hartford a two-point advantage at 21-19 as the Jaguars held on for the sweep. \nHartford (6-18, 1-4) travels to Olpe next Tuesday for a triangular with Waverly and the Eagles. \nArea Capsules \nLebo knocked off Olpe in five sets on the Wolves’ home court. \nOlpe took the first 25-21 but dropped the next 17-25. The Eagles responded with a 25-17 win in the third set, but Lebo took control from there, winning the next set (25-9) decisively. Lebo kept the momentum in the fifth set, capturing the win by a 15-9 margin. \nCouncil Grove swept Herington in a two-match dual, with the Braves taking the first match in three sets: 20-25, 25-15 and 25-22. Council Grove needed just two sets in the second match, winning 25-21, 25-13. \nThe sweep improved Council Grove to 21-4 on the season and 12-0 in the Flint Hills League, which the Braves have clinched the regular season title for with one league match to play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:27:59.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
