I’ve had a great time, but feel it’s time to focus on my family and other career interests. \n“After several months of thought and discussion with my family and my team, we realise our future includes many things in MMA, but active competition in the sport is no longer one of them. \n“This isn’t goodbye, as I will still be very much involved in the sport but just not as a fighter.
