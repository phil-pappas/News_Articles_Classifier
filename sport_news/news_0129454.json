For Ole Miss and Hugh Freeze, that time is now. \nThere were two main reasons to pay Freeze $4.3 million a year, as Ole Miss agreed to do 11 months ago: keep him going to Florida, and to continue on the path of SEC championship contention. Well, Freeze is now 0-for-2 against Florida and Memphis in the last three weeks, and a title of any kind seems remarkably far away. No. 13 Ole Miss is now in danger of a free fall after a 37-24 loss to Memphis, a game remarkable for not only by how much Ole Miss was outplayed but how Freeze was outcoached. \nMemphis (6-0, 2-0 C-USA) pays Justin Fuente $1.4 million a year, and he earned every bit of it on Saturday. The Tigers played with poise, passion and purpose. They dug themselves out of an early 14-0 hole by scoring the next 31 points and then hung on when Ole Miss tried to make one last desperate push. Memphis football is real, and it’s spectacular. \nThe Tigers played how Ole Miss (5-2, 2-1 SEC) used to play, in those 2012 and 2013 days when no one knew whether or not to treat the Rebels as a real threat but you knew Freeze would maximize the team’s potential week-to-week. Ole Miss can still play that way -- we saw it just a month ago, in Alabama -- but not since then. You have to wonder what happened, and no one I asked after the game had a firm answer. \n“Injuries have hurt obviously but that’s not the reason we didn’t play well today,” Freeze said. “I’ve got to coach them better and have leadership in the locker room.” \nIt’s not fair to judge individual effort when you’re not on the field, but you could sit in the press box in the Liberty Bowl on Saturday and see what happened. Ole Miss collectively let up after it scored two touchdowns in the first five minutes and 16 seconds. It all looked so easy to predict then: Chad Kelly was going to throw for 500 yards against Memphis’ weak defense and a Tiger crowd (attendance was 60,241, and probably 75 percent in favor of the home team) would go home early and disappointed. \nBut not only did Ole Miss not put the game away, it fell apart. Memphis converted 12-of-20 third-downs, eight of which were from at least seven yards out. That previously mentioned Tigers’ D? All of a sudden it was living in the Ole Miss backfield. \nFreeze did not help anyone or anything with two fourth-down calls that failed miserably. The first came right after defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche, moonlighting as a fullback, failed to convert a third-and-one at the Memphis 10 in the second quarter. Nkemdiche suffered a concussion, sat out the rest of the game and invited lots of second-guessing about why the All-American was being exposed to unnecessary risk. Ole Miss was up 14-7, its sideline momentarily stunned by the injury. Kick the field goal, right? Nope. A pitch to Jordan Wilkins loss six yards. \n“I felt good about that one,” Freeze said. “I felt good about the call. They made a great play on it.” \nHere’s how big of a momentum-changer that decision was: Memphis scored 24 points on its next five drives, gaining 228 yards on 34 plays. Ole Miss gained 11 on 14, and never got past its own 39. That was the game. \nOne of those touchdowns, which made it 24-14 Memphis right before halftime, was set up by another fourth down decision. Freeze said he felt like he needed to do something to stall the Tigers’ momentum and that with two minutes left it was critical to score points. But having Kelly try a quarterback sneak from your own 35? He never had a chance, and a brilliant scoring opportunity was handed to the surging opponent. \n“That wasn’t a good decision,” Freeze admitted. \nOle Miss is out of gimme nonconference games in which it can run up the points and build false confidence. In fact, next Saturday’s game against Texas A&M is the start of a brutal five-game stretch against the SEC West to close the season. Players talked afterwards about how they could still win the SEC, but I’m not sure if they were trying to convince us or themselves. \nWhat happens next is going to be because of Freeze. He has to convince the upperclassmen to stay in the moment, and get the underclassmen to understand the gravity of the situation (and that winning takes more than just showing up). There are major schematic issues on offense and defense that must be sorted out, and the prospect of losing Nkemdiche only adds to the difficulty of finding the best 11 players to be on the field at any given time. \nThis moment right now is the most difficult in Freeze’s career. We’re going to find out exactly what he is capable of.
