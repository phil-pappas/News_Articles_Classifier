The second one, which was tipped by a Deacon defender, prompted the frustrating, air-punching gesture by Williams and set up a Wake Forest touchdown. \nBut even though he never entered a phone booth, Williams somehow went from super dud to Superman in the blink of an eye in steering the Tar Heels to a 50-14 rout of the Demon Deacons at Kenan Stadium. \n\"I think it shows his maturity and where he is as a quarterback. He didn't panic,'' UNC coach Larry Fedora said after watching Williams engineer six of the Tar Heels' seven touchdown drives - all but one in less than a minute and 47 seconds. \nAfter completing just three of his first seven passes and gaining three yards on three rushes, Williams connected on 11 of his next 13 throws for 244 yards and three touchdowns. He also ran nine more times for 56 yards and another score. \nNot bad for a guy who many in the press box, and probably more than a few at Kenan Staduim, were wondering how long Fedora would wait before replacing Williams with sophomore Mitch Trubisky after the rocky start. \nTrubisky did wind up playing against the Deacons, but only in a mop-up role after Williams had led the Tar Heels to 43-14 advantage. \nVisions of opener \nVisions of the season opener in Charlotte against South Carolina had to be running through Williams' mind after throwing the second interception Saturday. Williams threw three interceptions in that game, two of them in the end zone that led to the Tar Heels only loss of the 2015 season. \nThe interceptions against the Deacons weren't as dramatic. The first was a case of miscommunication on the route between Williams and receiver Ryan Switzer, and the second just a good play by a Wake defensive lineman. But they could have been just as damaging had Williams not calmed himself. \n\"We were down 7-0 and I knew that was on me,'' Williams said. \"I just had to settle down. I mean, I could have just blown up. But I've learned to work through adversity. My mindset was to get back, get ready, execute, move the ball down the field and put seven (points) on the board.'' \nWilliams did just that on the first play of the second quarter, laying up a pass down field that receiver Mack Hollins ran under for a 43-yard touchdown play to tie the score. It was the first of three catches in the game for Hollins, all of which went for touchdowns. \nBy the time the second quarter ended, Williams would run for another score, set up a second with a 61-yard completion and helped UNC take control of the game with a 29-14 advantage. The carnage would continue in the second half before Williams came to the sidelines where he was greeted by high fives and fist bumps from his teammates. \nA rewarding effort \nThe 50 points were especially rewarding to Williams, who said he was irritated by all the pre-game talk about the Wake Forest defense. \nThe Deacons were ranked among the nation's top units and had been impressive the last two weeks limiting high-scoring Florida State to 24 points in a narrow loss and shutting out Boston College 3-0 last Saturday. \n\"I was tired of hearing about their great defense,'' Williams said. \"We really wanted to come in and dominate. We didn't start fast like we wanted to, but we were finally able to click.'' \nWilliams certainly had lots of support with sophomore running back Elijah Hood racking up 101 yards rushing on just eight carries and Hollins scoring every time he touched the ball. But it wasn't until Williams got untracked that the Tar Heels took control. \nThe victory lifted the Tar Heels to 5-1 overall and 2-0 in ACC play for the first time since 1997. The start in league play has started some believing UNC may have a chance to win the ACC Coastal Division this year. \nBut that can only happen if Williams continues to play like he did after the first quarter against Wake Forest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:13:41.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
