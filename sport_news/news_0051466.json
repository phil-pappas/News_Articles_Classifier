One of them, Nemanja Matic, was sent off, making seven cautions in all. \nThat incident upset coach Silvino Louro and manager Jose Mourinho who were both sent to the stands. \nThe FA await referee Jon Moss' report before deciding on further punishment but it would not necessarily trigger the suspended stadium ban that Mourinho faces after criticising another official following Chelsea's home defeat by Southampton this month. \nThe Premier League will also write to Chelsea about a possible breach of the regulation that clubs must fulfil media obligations after a game. \nNeither Mourinho nor any of his coaches attended the traditional post-match news conference at West Ham. \nThe normal sanction is a warning or a fine although the Premier League said that is often not made public. \nChelsea have no planned news conference before Tuesday's League Cup match at Stoke City. \n(Reporting by Steve Tongue; Editing by Tony Jimenez ) \nOur top news photography from this week.
