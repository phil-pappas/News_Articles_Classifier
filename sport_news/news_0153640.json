Quarterback Jake Peterson added 101 rushing yards and scored twice with 18 carries.\n“They came out today with a purpose and definitely helped us run well,” Vargus said about his teammate in the trenches.\nThe East Bridgewater defense controlled the line of scrimmage in a similar fashion, limiting Abington (3-1) to 137 yards and never allowing the Green Wave to get inside the 25-yard line.\nThe Vikings defensive front made a big stand on the opening series of the game, stopping Abington three times as it attempted to gain 1 yard it needed at the East Bridgewater 38.\n“Mike Chaupetta and Eric Marchant, our defensive tackles, and two senior captains for us, they had a rough game last year playing (Abington) in the (Div. 5) South final, so they took a lot of this personal and just made sure they did their job,” East Bridgewater coach Shawn Tarpey said. “When they do their job, they’re so big and strong, they have a big impact moving out from the middle of that defense.”\nVargus finished off the ensuing six-play, 68-yard drive with a 17-yard TD.\nPeterson added a 4-yard TD run midway through the second quarter for a 14-0 halftime lead and then sealed it with a 20-yard score in the fourth.\nElsewhere in the South Shore League, John Goode and Ryan Shea rushed for second-half touchdowns and the defense did the rest for Rockland (2-2) in a 14-0 victory against Carver .\nBoys soccer\nJerry Ozor scored twice and added an assist as Milton Academy (5-0) shut out Thayer , 4-0, in an Independent School League clash.\nIn Catholic Central action, Brian St. Croix scored his eighth of the season and it was the only tally during a 1-0 win by Archbishop Williams (6-1) over Bishop Fenwick (4-3-1).\nGirls soccer\nCarey Allard scored twice as Belmont (4-3) defeated Reading , 2-0, in the Middlesex League. . . .
