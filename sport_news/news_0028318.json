I've been reading some pundits who think the Rams loss will focus the Cards. This isn't baseball with its 162 game schedule. When you only play 16 games, every game is crucial. The Cards gave one away and they'll be luckily if it doesn't cost them. This week the Cards face the Lions . That team is in free fall and while some of them may be angry at getting robbed by the zebras others will rightly think their season is over. The Cards need to get up early and keep the pressure on. At some point some of the Lions may feel doomed. This was a marginal game at one point, but now it's a \"should win.\" The Rams identified some Cardinal weaknesses, most based on a lack of discipline and execution. Those must be cleaned up. No more giveaways! No more drops! This will be a tough week for Seattle. With a little luck the Cards could get their 2 game lead back. If this team wants to be a real contender it must play like a dominant team. They must be more physical; finesse won't be enough. This week they must get real pressure on the QB. Stafford gets nervous if physically threatened. This is a great test for the defense. The Lions can be held down and should be. The Cards should have one of the best offenses in the NF L and it's time to play that way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:37:03.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
