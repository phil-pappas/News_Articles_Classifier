He’s been the greatest player I’ve ever seen,” West told the Huffington Post . “And I’m probably a harsh judge of talent in the sense that I admire players that are really good defensive players and really good offensive players. And I felt that at his time in the game, he was the best defensive player in the game, but more importantly he was the best offensive player. And he made his teams win.”\nThe logo, which has featured West’s silhouette since 1969, generates the league more than $3 billion a year in licensing.\nWe NEED an @ESPN @30for30 on Jerry West!!
