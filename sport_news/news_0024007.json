The controversial figure was fined £50,000 (roughly $77,000) by England’s Football Association for comments he made against match referees while speaking to the media after the Premier League team’s 3-1 loss to Southampton on Oct. 3. In addition, the FA imposed a suspended one-match stadium ban on the 52-year-old should he become a repeat offender in the next year. \nThe decision comes just more than a week after the FA first charged Mourinho for misconduct over his comments, in which he said the referees are “afraid to give decisions to Chelsea.” \nMourinho recognized the risk almost immediately in making the disparaging comment about the match officials and practically dared the FA to take action. \n“If the Football Association wants to punish me they can,” he said. \nWell, they did. \n[ Mourinho gets Chelsea’s ‘full support’ as team continues to melt down ] \nThe financial impact of the fine likely won’t make too much a difference to the thickness of Mourinho’s wallet. In August, Mourinho inked a new four-year deal with the team which bumped up his roughly $13 million annual salary by an undisclosed amount. \nChelsea, meanwhile, is still paying for its string of losses in the Premier League standings this season. The defending champions are currently in 16th place, 10 points behind leaders Manchester City. The team will hope to start its comeback on Saturday when the Blues host Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge.
