Colby Lewis will start for Texas against Marco Estrada.\nAlberto, only in the lineup because star third baseman Adrian Beltre was out with a strained back, made an error that led to Toronto's first run. He delivered an RBI single with two outs in the 14th, and Delino DeShields followed with an infield hit for another run.\nTexas shut out the highest-scoring team in the majors after the fifth inning. The victory made road teams 5-0 in the postseason so far.\nKeone Kela (1-0) worked one inning for the win, staying calm after a dust-up with Toronto slugger Josh Donaldson. Ross Ohlendorf, with an old-school, double-armed windup, finished for a first save. LaTroy Hawkins (0-1) took the loss.\nShare this page Tweet This article filed under: MLB Baseball Pro Men Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-10T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:42:44.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
