That's because Lansing has forfeited Friday night's game against the Blue Devils because of a lack of healthy players. \nThis comes after Whitney Point forfeited against Forks two weeks ago. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nWith those two games off the schedule, a quarter of Forks' regular season games have been cancelled. For some seniors on the team that's tough to swallow. \n\"Especially for the seniors you know, it kind of hurts,\" said senior running back Cody Lamond. \"We only have a limited amount of football games in our lives, to know we missed two of them is a little sad, but we'll get through it.\" \n\"We're still trying to make the most of it, obviously,\" said head coach Dave Hogan. \"You can control what you can control. We're still trying to have some fun, we're still trying to get better, it just makes it a little more challenging.\" \nAccording to Section IV football chairman David Garbarino, a team needs 16 healthy players to compete in a game. \nThere have now been four forfeits in Section IV football this year.
