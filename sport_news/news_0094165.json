In that case, police said Spadoni got away with $300 of withdrawn cash, and a $100 gift card and $5 from the victimâ€™s wallet.\nOn Wednesday (Oct. 14) police said Spadoni was the gunman who held up a group of people in Mid-City. In that case, a gunman approached a group of four people near Cleveland and Lopez streets Wednesday just after 9 p.m. and demanded their property.\nSpadoni now faces several charges, including armed robbery, false imprisonment with a weapon, aggravated assault with a firearm, attempted armed robbery and carrying a weapon on school property.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
