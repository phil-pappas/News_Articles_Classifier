The playoff march is officially off an running for the Traip Academy boys soccer team. Henry Driscoll scored two goals — including the game-winner on a penalty kick with 2:20 remaining in regulation — and the ninth-seeded Rangers defeated No. 8 Lisbon 2-1 in Saturday’s Maine Class C South quarterfinal game. “We had a real good week of practice,” Traip coach Donny Gagnon said. “I give all the credit to these players. … They went in knowing we’ve been playing some great soccer lately.” The Rangers improved to 4-9-2 and will travel to face top-seeded Hall-Dale (12-0-2) in the regional semifinals on Wednesday. Both teams converted a penalty kick. For Lisbon (8-7), the opportunity came early in the second half off a bad foul in the box. The conversion tied the game, 1-1. But Traip controlled the possession and stalked the Lisbon goal from that point forward. They built enough pressure to draw their own PK opportunity, which Driscoll, Traip’s star senior, didn’t miss. Driscoll opened the scoring with time winding down in the first half, assisted by Andrew Davis. “Henry Driscoll had a great day for us,” Gagnon said. “He was all over the field.” Senior Matt Cambridge paced a defense that played ahead of goalie Blue Clark, who stopped all nine of the shots he faced in the flow of regulation. On one play in the second half, he denied two chances — the first on a dive, the second off a ricochet — to keep his team from falling behind. “To be honest with you,” Gagnon said, “I don’t know how he saved it. It was an unbelievable play.” Traip will face Hall-Dale for the first time this season on Wednesday. BOYS SOCCER MAINE CLASS B SOUTH QUARTERFINALS No. 6 York 3, No. 11 Leavitt 0 YORK, Maine — Sophomore James Peter scored two goals and the Wildcats advanced to Wednesday’s Maine Class B South quarterfinals, where they will meet third-seeded Greely. York improved to 6-7-2. After a scoreless first half, goals from Peter and Ryan Webb put the game in York’s control. Alex Nickerson assisted on Peter’s gap that capped the scoring late. Leavitt closed at 4-9-2. Portsmouth Abbey 1, Berwick Academy 0 PORTSMOUTH, R.I. — James Ordway and Derek Muse played well for Berwick in defeat in prep school action.
