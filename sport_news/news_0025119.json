The country’s categorical stand was conveyed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Deputy Prime Minister of Nepal Kamal Thapa, who called on him here and briefed him on the developments in the country. Conveying his best wishes to the new government that took over in Kathmandu about a week ago, Modi underlined that India was committed to strengthening the traditional bonds of friendship and kinship with the people of Nepal. Thapa, who recently assumed charge as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Himalayan country, arrived here on Saturday for a three-day trip and held meetings with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar. Over the past few weeks, relations between India and Nepal came under strain especially with the leadership there holding New Delhi responsible for “blockade” that has affected movement of supplies from the plains to the Hills. Ever since the adoption of a new Constitution the intensity of agitation by a large section of Nepali citizens, who stay in southern parts like Terai, have been protesting, leading to difficulty of vehicles from India carrying goods and supplies. During his meeting with the External Affairs Minister, the visiting dignitary raised his country’s concern over the obstruction of supplies leading to people facing difficulties. On her part, she reiterated that the obstruction was on account of problem of closure or reduced entry points on Nepalese side by people of the region there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:19:35.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
