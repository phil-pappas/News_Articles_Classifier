The last time these two teams met, the Patriots ran away with a 45-7 win in the AFC championship. Of course, what happened after that game – the start of Deflategate – has left a lot of local fans hungry for another blowout. The Patriots will look to start this season 5-0 for the fourth time in team history and third time under Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. If they succeed, they’ll join the 1974, 2004 and 2007 teams. Brady is the third quarterback in NFL history with at least four 4-0 starts. The Patriots will be without a handful of starters for this contest. In the past week, they’ve placed left tackle Nate Solder and cornerback Tarell Brown on season-ending injured reserve. The team also downgraded linebacker Dont’a Hightower to out on Saturday. Expect Marcus Cannon to fill in for Solder, but don’t be surprised if he moves to right tackle (where’s he’s more comfortable) and Sebastian Vollmer slides to left tackle. With Brown out, the Patriots will rely on a very green cornerback ground that includes Malcolm Butler, Logan Ryan, Justin Coleman and Rashaan Melvin. With Hightower out, the Patriots have Jerod Mayo, Jonathan Freeny and Jon Bostic to fill in next to Jamie Collins. The Patriots inactives are as follows: Hightower, Ryan Wendell, Trey Flowers, Khyri Thornton, Aaron Dobson, Geneo Grissom and Rufus Johnson. PUP list updates Brandon LaFell traveled with the team for the second game in a row. The wide receiver, who is on the physically unable to perform list, suffered a foot injury over the past year, which set him back. He worked out on the field, with trainer Moses Cabrera. LaFell is eligible to come off the PUP list Monday, along with defensive tackle Chris Jones and linebacker Dane Fletcher. Just because the players are eligible doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll play right away. The Patriots will have a five-week window to allow a player on the PUP list to start practicing. Once a player starts practicing, they’ll have a 21-day window to get added to the 53-man roster. If either of these deadlines pass, the player will return to PUP for the rest of the season. When the Patriots decide to activate LaFell, Jones or Fletcher, they will have to make corresponding moves and clear up roster space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:27:41.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
