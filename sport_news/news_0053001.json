Making matters even more difficult was the task at hand. “It’s always a tough week when you play Exeter,” PHS assistant Tim Hopley said. The Clippers needed to dig down and find their best game against the undefeated Blue Hawks. Instead, they gave up 16 points on special teams and trailed by 23 at halftime in an eventual 43-14 defeat at Tom Daubney Field. Portsmouth senior Shon Parham rushed for 41 yards and a touchdown, caught five balls for 39 yards and another score, and later subbed in at quarterback and passed for 20 yards. He was Portsmouth’s bright spot on a night it needed a whole lot more. “When we kind of broke down the game in the week leading up — you’ve got to play flawless,” Hopley said, “because the way Exeter controls the ball, you only have so many chances. You know you’re only going to get so many opportunities, and you’ve got to cash those in. I think we were inside the 20 three times in the first half and we only came away with seven. “Obviously, we didn’t get off to the start we wanted.” It was a nightmarish first quarter in the rain for the Clippers, who gave up a safety on a blocked punt from their own 11, the snap coming in high and Exeter’s Hunter Long batting the ball out of the back of the end zone. Later, after Exeter marched 55 yards and scored on Mason Wallace’s 2-yard plunge, the Clippers mishandled another snap — this one sailing over the punter’s head and skipping another 20 yards to the end zone, where Long pounced on it for a touchdown. It was part of a monster first half for Long, Exeter’s 6-foot-5 senior defensive end, who also caught a 76-yard touchdown pass from Kyle Ball early in the second quarter to open a 23-0 Exeter lead. “He’s a beast,” Hopley said of Long. “We saw him on tape block the kick with Salem last week.” It was covered on the practice field and in meetings, but containing Long and Exeter’s power run game proved to be a chore. Wallace led the team with 60 yards rushing and two touchdowns. The Blue Hawks (6-0) began rotating in fresh bodies in the second half and finished with 17 separate rushers for 259 yards. “All the hard work that everyone puts in,” Exeter senior Nathan Rumford said, “it’s nice that everyone gets a chance to touch the ball, get to play.” The Clippers scored their first points in the second quarter, one drive after they saw a march to the Exeter 4 stall on downs. Quarterback Cody Graham went 6 of 8 on a drive that started at the Portsmouth 26 and ended with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Parham. Trailing 23-7, the Clippers were a few defensive stops away from making it a game, like they did in a competitive loss (30-20) to Londonderry last week. But on this night, their ensuing kickoff, a squib attempt on the wet turf, was handled by Exeter’s Jacob Porazinski and returned to the 45. Eight plays later, Wallace went up the middle untouched for a 5-yard scoring run, capping a drive in which he rushed for 36 yards on four carries. The Blue Hawks, leading 30-7, played from ahead to start the second half for the first time since Week 2. After mounting second-half comebacks in three consecutive weeks, they opened the third quarter with reserve back Bradley Cammett slingshotting off an arm tackle and breaking free for a 27-yard touchdown run. In the fourth, after Parham entered at quarterback and scored on a slicing 8-yard run, Exeter capped the game’s scoring with one more special teams TD. This time, Porazinski scooped up his own team’s fumble along the sideline and broke away for a 65-yard kickoff return. Graham finished 14 of 26 passing for 136 yards and a touchdown. He was intercepted by Exeter’s Michael Petersen in the third quarter. Ryan Edney had three receptions for 57 yards and Jake Lorenz caught four for 47 in a loss that dropped the Clippers to 1-5. “I said to them, we’ve got to let it in to the point that it hurts, because when it hurts, that’s when we can get better,” Hopley said of his message to the players, “that’s when we can make improvements. “This has to hurt, because this has kind of been a recurring theme throughout the course of the season, and we’ve got to show improvements. We just haven’t been able to get those stops. We haven’t been able to punch it in when we’ve had the opportunities to. You know, would ofs, could ofs, shoulds ofs ... and at the end we’re just not getting it done.” Exeter 16 14 7 6—43 Portsmouth 0 7 0 7—14 First quarter Exe—Safety (blocked punt), 8:14.
