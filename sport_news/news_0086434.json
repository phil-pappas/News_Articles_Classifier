(Clark Wade / The Star) Colts head coach Chuck Pagano took the blame for the fake punt play Sunday, but it actually fell on receiver Griff Whalen. (Photo: Matt_Kryger / The_Star, Matt_Kryger_The Star) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nChuck Pagano isn't the one who buried Griff Whalen. But he is the one who stepped aside and watched it happen. \nFor two days Pagano has jutted out his chin and given the impression of shielding Whalen — and the rest of the special teams unit behind that laughably bad fake punt Sunday night against New England. Blame me, Pagano said. My fault, the Indianapolis Colts coach said. \nHow noble, we said. \nHow misleading, we now know. \nPagano might have thought he was using himself as a human shield to protect Whalen from the national onslaught that ensued. But what he was doing — and Chuck Pagano is dumb like a fox — was watching in silence as the world laughed at Griff Whalen. Insider: The real story behind botching of Colts' fake punt \nBecause now we know the rest of the story. The story behind that awful fake punt, when the Colts faced fourth-and-3 from their own 37. Late third quarter. Trailing 27-21. Punt team on the field. Nine players line up wide right – punter Pat McAfee and eight blockers. \nTwo players stay with the ball. Colt Anderson and Griff Whalen. \nFour Patriots are hovering near the ball. Whatever the Colts are trying to do — get the Patriots to jump offside, force a timeout, catch them with too many men on the field — it didn't work. \nOnce the bluff failed, I'm told by people familiar with the play's design, Anderson was wrong to crouch behind Whalen and extend his hands for the ball. Because the worst thing Whalen can do, at that moment, is snap the ball to Anderson. \nWhalen snaps the ball to Anderson. \nThe Patriots swallow up Anderson, the crowd is in disbelief, the game is about to be irretrievably lost. \nThe world is about to laugh at the Colts. \nAppearing to be noble, Pagano told the media: My fault. Bad coaching. Blame me. By hiding behind Leadership 101 clichés, Pagano was leaving Whalen's neck out there. \nAnd the guillotine has fallen. NFL hot seat coaching index: Pagano feels the heat after botched play call \nThe country has spent the last 24 hours mocking Griff Whalen. Hell, so have I. On a handful of national radio shows, I've rationalized the mistake like so: \n\"There were 70,000 people at Lucas Oil Stadium the other night,\" I've been saying. \"Only one of them thought it was a good idea to snap the ball to Colt Anderson.\" \nPause. \n\"Unfortunately, that one person was the snapper.\" \nRim shot. Aren't I funny? Nah, not funny at all. \nBecause I didn't know. None of us knew. Because Pagano never came out and said what he should have said, what we now know, that Whalen was the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. What Pagano said was this: The Colts worked on that play all week in practice. \n\"It wasn't desperation,\" he said after the game. \"It was stuff that was practiced.\" \n… just not by Griff Whalen. \nDid Pagano forget that part? \nThe snapper all week in practice on that awful play, a play that will live forever in infamy — right up there with the Mark Sanchez butt fumble — was Clayton Geathers. \nNot Griff Whalen. \nPagano never said that. Not Sunday, not Monday, not ever. And Griff Whalen, to his credit, hasn't said it either. Not once has he used the excuse — the truth — that he was filling in for an injured player. Colts’ fake punt among NFL’s dumbest plays \nWe know it only because Pat McAfee went on the syndicated radio program \"The Bob & Tom Show\" Tuesday morning and told the backstory behind the play. And while McAfee hasn't participated in the national firestorm his comments created, I feel confident saying this, after having come to know McAfee fairly well: He was only defending Whalen, not blaming Pagano. \nBut I'll blame Pagano. And I like the guy, honest. Might not seem like it here, but so what. Pagano is more than what happened Sunday night, more than the aftermath of that botched play. \nBut that play did happen. The aftermath — and Pagano's self-serving show of \"blame me\" loyalty — did happen. And must be addressed. \nAnd Whalen must be defended. If not by Pagano — not nearly enough by Pagano — then by the rest of us. Whalen was given the most important role on the most important play in the most important game of the season — without practicing it that way. And yet the Colts called the play anyway. That's coaching malpractice. \nAnd people do make mistakes. All of us do. Writing mistakes? I've made them. Mechanical mistakes? Mechanics make them. Coaching mistakes? Chuck Pagano made one. It happens. \nBut this … I find it so hard to believe that this really happened. \nHard to believe that a player's coach as loyal as Chuck Pagano has allowed — hasn't created, but has absolutely allowed — the national narrative to proceed that Griff Whalen is the bonehead behind the biggest bonehead play of the 2015 NFL season. \nThe Colts love Pagano because he's a friend as much as a boss. He barks when it's time to bark, bites when it's time to bite, and hugs when it's time to hug. Players love — people love — a leader like that. \nBut this was false leadership. Pagano has said the play was his fault, perhaps knowing the world would admire his loyalty. \nPagano has not said why it was his fault, perhaps knowing the world would stop laughing at the player – and start laughing at the coach. \nFind Star columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/gregg.doyel .
