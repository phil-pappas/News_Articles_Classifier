The following day features qualifying (0930) and the Four Hours of Estoril (1300). Estoril is a very strong track for the Gibson, and as a track Estoril takes some beating. We will be absolutely flat out for the win to ensure we bring home the championship - nothing is going to stop us this year! & Lives: Coimbra (P): I cant wait to go to Estoril and to have this great championship finalé. The track suits us very well. To be racing in front of my home crowd is always special. I will use all of my experience that I have learnt with JOTA Sport and Audi Sport to stay focused and give it my best. A race win would earn me the ELMS title in my own country and that would be a dream. JOTA has great momentum in the team and us drivers. Nearing the end of a second season together, we really know each other well. Personally, I have the feeling that we won the previous race even if that is not the reality. The Estoril track is very tricky to overtake on and there is no room for mistakes without getting punished. The aim has to be to stand on the top step of the podium and I really believe this is possible. Well be pushing for the pole-position and another race win. Estoril is where Ive been looking forward to most on the ELMS calendar. It should be a really strong track for the Gibson. The car ran well there in 2014 and we finished on the podium despite a few incidents in the race. I qualified on pole by half a second last year and I just love Estorils track characteristics. Its very, very simple. JOTA Sport is going to Estoril to win the race and in doing so claim the Drivers and Teams European Le Mans Series titles. We finished third in last years corresponding race which resulted in missing out on the championship by four-points. Our Gibson has been totally rebuilt after taking the chequered flag first in the last race at Paul Ricard. Having ultimately been denied that win, the three drivers and all team members are hungry and determined to successfully close out this years title.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:52:20.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
