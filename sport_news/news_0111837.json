Just keep playing.\" \nThe Tigers, who acquired Norris in a trade with Toronto in July, said they were aware of his condition when they made the move and expect him to make a full recovery. \nNorris started 13 games this season, finishing 3-2 with a 3.75 ERA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:54:54.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
