They won’t always be the top-4 in CPP value, but, promise to provide value at their relative cost. By default, our cost/point calculations are developed using Draft Kings ‘ pricing strategy, but, you can toggle between DK and Fanduel using the overall table below the picks. Week 6 DFS Plays: Quarterback Andy Dalton stood up well against the Seahawks at home last week, and now fantasy’s #1 QB has a much softer matchup (Photo: Andy Lyons/Getty Images North America). \nAndy Dalton – Draft Kings Salary: $5,700 – My Rank: QB5 – Salary Rank: QB15 – Cost/Point: $5,700 \nBuffalo’s defense hasn’t lived up to the name brand against opposing QBs just yet, while Dalton is enjoying all the weapons he’s suddenly surrounded with in Cincinnati. With a Tyrod Taylor limited by injury or EJ Manuel limited by being EJ Manuel set to face Cincinnati’s own strong defense, Dalton should be able to keep up the pace. Buffalo has allowed 10 scores and 1,405 yards through the air to date, including multiple touchdowns in every game except for Marcus Mariota ‘s outing last week. Count on Dalton to produce another notch in that column this week. Dalton is fantasy’s #1 QB through five weeks. \nCarson Palmer – Draft Kings Salary: $6,600 – My Rank: QB3 – Salary Rank: QB6 – Cost/Point: $294 \nPittsburgh’s secondary has struggled as well, producing just three interceptions and allowing three of five opposing QBs to top 275 yards. As with the above matchup, I think Arizona’s defense can force Mike Vick into yielding some short fields, and presenting the offense with a chance to score. Palmer has thrown for three or more TDs three times, and fewer than two just once. He’s a great anchor play with potential for a big outing. Week 6 DFS Plays: Running Back \nLeGarrette Blount – Draft Kings Salary: $4,400 – My Rank: RB17 – Salary Rank: RB28 – Cost/Point: $368 \nPointing out that the Pats have butchered the Colts on the ground in their recent meetings is easy analysis, but, the game plan for their last three outings against Indy has indeed been to pound the team through the middle and we’re familiar with the results. With Dion Lewis expected to play, though dealing with an abdomen injury, the Patriots could shift away from him earlier than usual and leave the game in Blount’s hands. \nJavorius “Buck” Allen – Draft Kings Salary: $4,300 – My Rank: RB37 – Salary Rank: RB31 – Cost/Point: n/a \nAllen’s true utility is contingent on Justin Forsett ‘s health, but, with Baltimore drawing a matchup against a 49ers D that has allowed six rushing TDs to backs so far and likely to focus on the ground attack with Steve Smith sidelined for another week, he could be a cheap source of 20 effective touches against a beatable defense and is running for a solid 4.8 YPC mark on his young career. Week 6 DFS Plays: Wide Receiver \nAnquan Boldin – Draft Kings Salary: $4,300 – My Rank: WR22 – Salary Rank: WR36- Cost/Point: $293 \nOn the flip side of the 49ers/Ravens game, I like Anquan Boldin against Balitmore’s suspect secondary. The 49ers went all Boldin, all the time last Sunday night and that plan produced Colin Kaepernick ‘s best game yet. Specifically, Boldin was targeted 11 times and topped the century mark on eight catches. Those numbers play just fine at his $4,300 salary and he stands a reasonable chance to beat them again given the 30.48 FPPG Baltimore has allowed to receivers to date, and their second-worst 1,096 yards and 84 receptions to the position. \nAllen Robinson – Draft Kings Salary: $5,900 – My Rank: WR8 – Salary Rank: WR20 – Cost/Point: $325 \nWhile Julius Thomas wasn’t a full go this past weekend, Robinson (and Allen Hurns ) remained a feature of the team’s offense even with him in the lineup, a promising sign. You won’t see nine targets every week, nor two scores (both marks he posted in Week 5) but you should see a lot of opportunity for the team’s #1 target. The Jags may find themselves in another unexpected shootout this week, which should mean plenty of opportunity for Robinson. \nDe’Anthony Thomas – Draft Kings Salary: $3,000 – My Rank: WR52 – Salary Rank: WR106 – Cost/Point: $387 \nThe floor here remains plenty low, but, at the minimum salary Thomas offers intriguing upside. We’re not quite sure just how the touches will work out at RB – though, Charcandrick West is known to be the lead candidate – and, Thomas should factor in as both a rusher and a receiver. He’s a better GPP play, given that low floor, but, the opportunity to make a few grabs and eve find the endzone again this week is present in the wake of Jamaal Charles ‘ injury. Week 6 DFS Plays: Tight End \nAntonio Gates – Draft Kings Salary: $4,600 – My Rank: TE6 – Salary Rank: TE7 – Cost/Point: $344 \nWhile we’re a week late in jumping on the Gates train here, his performance in Week 1 is certainly heartening for those looking to see value from the veteran TE. Gates was involved from the first snap last week, and, drew 11 targets overall. While that was influenced, in part, by Stevie Johnson ‘s injury, it’s also a clear sign that Gates is a part of the team’s plan in the red zone, and elsewhere on the field. Green Bay’s defense has been strong this year, but, TEs have been targeted 40 times against them through five games (the 8th highest total in the league) and Gates should keep that trend rolling this week. Week 6 DFS Plays: Defense \nCarolina Panthers – Draft Kings Salary: $3,900 – My Rank: DST1- Salary Rank: DST10 – Cost/Point: $201 \nRussell Wilson is on track to be sacked a record breaking number of times behind poor offensive line play.The Panthers have just nine sacks but should still produce their share of pressure, and could cause a few turnovers while winning a low scoring game.
