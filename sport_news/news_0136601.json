(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — Salvador Perez and the Kansas City Royals didn’t exactly flip out Friday night at Kauffman Stadium. But they had good enough reason to. \nPowered by Perez’s home run and six quality innings from Edinson Volquez, the Royals defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5-0 in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. Perez’s fourth-inning blast wasn’t as dramatic as Jose Bautista’s was in the AL Division Series, but it served as a reminder that these Royals have some pop, too, especially Perez, who has a regiment that he follows to provide tht powerful punch. \n“Eat good and work out,” Perez said with a smile, while flexing his right bicep. \nPerez’s homer to left-center off Toronto right-hander Marco Estrada (1-1) traveled 392 feet and marked his third of the postseason, putting him within striking distance of the club record. \nA year ago, Mike Moustakas set the standard with five playoff home runs. But just six games into this postseason, Perez could soon rewrite the record book. And so could Royals designated hitter Kendrys Morales. Morales also has three homers this October, having swatted three against the Astros in the ALDS. \nWhen Perez’s bat struck Estrada’s first pitch of the fourth inning — a 90 mph four-seam fastball — the sound boomed inside a stadium packed with 39,753 screaming fans. In an instant, Perez knew it was gone. Yet he did not showboat … or flip his bat. \nAs the ball rocketed through the cool air, Perez admired the distance from afar, and his brute strength. \nSince arriving in Kansas City in 2011, Perez has been a force at the plate and behind it. Perez’s power numbers have increased each season in his big league career, and his defense has been as good as gold the past two years. And Perez could possibly win another Gold Glove this year. \nPerez helped guide Volquez (1-1) through six scoreless innings. It was the first time a Royals starter didn’t allow a run this October. After breezing through the first five innings, Volquez got into trouble in the sixth with two consecutive walks to start the inning. But Volquez escaped unscathed as he struck out two and got a fly-ball out to left fielder Alex Gordon. \n“Salvy and I changed the whole game plan during the game,” Volquez said. “I was going to throw inside, but I commanded the outside corner the whole game.” \nVolquez was hitting 97 on the radar gun and his breaking ball was as sharp as it’s been all season. But Perez said Volquez can pitch even better. \n“That’s nothing,” Perez said. “Trust me. I’ve seen it, but he was pretty good today.” \nPerez, who stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 240 pounds, presents a big target, one that makes him susceptible to getting hit behind the plate. In the eighth, with Josh Donaldson at the plate, Donaldson’s bat hit Perez on the hand as he followed through on a swing. \nPerez, who often plays hurt, showed his toughness again and stayed in the game. He then guided Ryan Madson out of a jam with the then-tying run at the plate. \n“He just takes a beating, just takes a beating,” Royals manager Ned Yost said. “But I think everybody feeds off his enthusiasm and energy that he brings to the ballpark every day.” \nThe Royals tacked on two more in the eighth as Eric Hosmer doubled in a run and Morales provided a sac fly. Gordon’s leadoff double to right in the third inning awoke the Royals offense, and he later scored on Alcides Escobar’s second double of the night. Two batters later, Escobar came home on a single by Cain to make it 2-0 Royals, setting up Perez’s solo blast. \nAs Perez crossed the plate, he pointed both fingers to the sky above. With a win in Game 2 on Saturday, the Royals would have a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series and a return trip to the Fall Classic would appear to be on the horizon. \n“We’re a team that always plays hard,” Perez said. “We’re going to play hard and see what happens.” \nNOTES \n■ Cain’s RBI single in the third extended his postseason hitting streak to 10 games. Amos Otis has the team record of 11. \n■ The Royals are in the ALCS for the eighth time in franchise history. They advanced to the World Series in 1980, 1985 and 20014. \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:35:50.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
