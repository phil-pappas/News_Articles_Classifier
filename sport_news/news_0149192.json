Third baseman Adrian Beltre is not starting for the Rangers. \nDonaldson left Thursday's 5-3 loss in the fifth, one inning after he was kneed in the head by second baseman Rougned Odor while breaking up a double play. Donaldson passed concussion tests Thursday and was tested again Friday before taking part in batting practice. Manager John Gibbons said Donaldson will try running on a treadmill before the game. \nBautista left with a sore right hamstring after popping out in the eighth, but Gibbons said Bautista was fine Friday. \nBeltre strained his lower back while sliding into second base in the first. He stayed in the game and hit an RBI single in the third, but struggled to run the bases and left between innings. Rangers manager Jeff Banister said Beltre is not well enough to play nine innings Friday, but would not rule out using him. \nHanser Alberto will start at third base and bat ninth for Texas. Mitch Moreland is starting at first base in place of Mike Napoli while Chris Giminez will catch left-hander Cole Hamels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:26:40.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
