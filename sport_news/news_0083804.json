This is a blow to Liverpool whose coach Brendan Rodgers was sacked last week. The Reds are now under the direction of Jurgen Klopp. The new coach comes in from Borussia Dortmund, Germany, where he won titles in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons. His first game as Manager at Liverpool will be versus a Tottenham Hotspur side that is undefeated in their last seven. Joe Gomez came over from the Championship side Charlton for £3.5 million.
