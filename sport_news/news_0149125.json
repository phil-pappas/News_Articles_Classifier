By Rick Peterson Jr. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nWith the connections Washburn has with Fort Hays State’s coaching staff, the Ichabods aren’t likely to be surprised by anything the Tigers throw at them. \nHowever, WU coach Craig Schurig knows familiarity won’t guarantee the Ichabods anything, especially with the Bods going up against two of the top running threats in the MIAA. \nRunning back Shaquille Cooper and quarterback Treveon Albert have combined for 990 rushing yards for the Tigers, who will play host to the Ichabods at 7 p.m. Saturday at Lewis Field Stadium. \nCooper leads the conference with 587 rushing yards while Albert ranks third with 403. \n“Offensively, they’re scary because they’ve really added some speed,” Schurig said. “Their tailback’s extremely fast. Between the two of them, it’s probably the most dynamic duo we have in the conference as far as the run game goes. \n“Those guys, if they get out in the open, both of them can take it the distance.” \nFort Hays State coach Chris Brown was a defensive coordinator at Washburn for nine seasons, and the Tigers’ defensive coordinator, Cooper Harris, was a defensive assistant at Washburn for 10 seasons. \n“We shouldn’t have a problem with where they line up,” Schurig said. “We should be able to line up the scout teams effectively and at least get your guys prepared. Then it comes down to technique and who can beat who and win the individual battles. \n“It’s kind of fun that way because you feel confident you know how they’re going to line up to certain things, so your guys will be coached up. Then, it comes down to performance.” \nThe Bods and Tigers enter with identical records, 3-1 overall and 3-1 in the MIAA. \nWashburn earned a come-from-behind 27-21 win over Missouri Southern last week, while Fort Hays State surrendered a 10-point halftime lead to Pitt State, falling 31-24 in Hays. \n“They have some great athletes on the offensive side of the ball and they make plays when they need to,” WU defensive lineman Trey Parker said. “I definitely think they’re confident in their team and their abilities. Even though they’re coming off a loss, they still feel like they’re one of the better teams in the conference.” \nFort Hays State ranks fourth in the conference in scoring defense, allowing 20 points a game. \nBrock Long leads the Tigers with 54 tackles while Alex Schmidtberger, a Hayden product, has 50 tackles with five tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks. \n“Their defensive line is really big and athletic,” WU quarterback Derek McGinnis said. “Their secondary and linebackers are obviously good as well. We’re going to have a challenge this week. But we’re confident going in here and hopefully will come out with another win this week.” \nThe Ichabods will be without senior receiver Connor Crimmins, who suffered a high-ankle sprain against Missouri Southern.
