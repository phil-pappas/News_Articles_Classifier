Will the addition of sophomore transfer Kevin McNulty to the Wildcats lineup be enough to fend off top-ranked Dana Hills? \n• The No. 2-ranked Capistrano Valley girls are also two-time defending champions. Injuries have plagued the Cougars this season, but they should get No. 3 Alyssa Bautista back from an ankle sprain. \n• Three-peats are at stake. Here is the last time they occurred: \nBoys: Dana Hills (2007-09). Girls: Esperanza (2001-03). \n• Brea Olinda senior Austin Tamagno could become the first individual to repeat as OC champion since Newport Harbor’s Paige Tennison (2011-12). He would be the first male to do so since El Toro’s Brandon Bethke (2003-2004). \n• The girls sweepstakes winner will be a first-time individual champion.
