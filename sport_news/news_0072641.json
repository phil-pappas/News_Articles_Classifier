But the goalkeeper is also living proof that just as nice guys don’t have to finish last, and neither do they have to be nice all the time.\nAdChoices After bounding into a Manchester hotel cafe last week, with a beaming smile and the energetic personality that has made him one of United States' most popular players, Howard sat down, took a sip of water and proceeded to get a little nasty.\nThe target in his sights was the Mexican national team, the USA’s opponent at the Rose Bowl on Saturday in a one-off clash that will give the victor a place in the Confederations Cup — an important World Cup warm-up tournament — in 2017.\nHoward, deep into a career that has seen him survive and thrive in the English Premier League and earn the nickname “Secretary of Defense” following his World Cup exploits last year, has been through enough to know that the special games are the ones where things are not all friendly and good-natured.\n“The bottom line is that Mexico is pissed off,” Howard told USA TODAY Sports. “They dominated soccer in our region of the world for decades and decades and we couldn’t land a glove on them. Over the last 15 years we’ve dominated the region.\"\n“I think they look at Americans and they don’t think we can play football, they don’t think we are very good yet we continue to get results against them. We have made sure we have continued to win games and play the right way. Whether that upsets them or not I don’t know. I don’t really care, that’s kind of the way it is.”\nThe “right way” is subjective, of course, and it is an argument that will never be resolved amicably. Americans — fans and players alike — insist that the Mexican squad takes a cynical approach to the game, using dirty tricks and on-field chicanery to fool referees and gain an advantage.\nMexico, on the flip side, would argue their tactics merely bend but not break the rules, and the U.S. complaints are unfounded.\nSuch conjecture is part of soccer. Where is the fun in having neighborly rivals who get along on a soccer field?\n“I have always thought that your fate and reputation and your legend will ultimately be decided as a U.S. player by how you perform against Mexico,” Howard said. “Those will be the games you remember and cherish. We talk about the hatred, that is bred out of respect. They fear us and vice versa, because we have a mutual respect.”\nHoward has been part of many such encounters and, virtually without fail, has equipped himself well. A 2-0 victory in Columbus in 2013, the night the U.S. punched its ticket to the World Cup, was a career highlight.\nOne of the rare lows came at the Rose Bowl four summers ago, when a 2-0 lead in the Gold Cup final turned into a 4-2 defeat, one that cost coach Bob Bradley his job.\nHoward was furious that evening and frustrated at having faced an overwhelmingly pro-Mexico crowd on American soil. Things have changed since. The American Outlaws fan group has grown in rapid time and though this game is to be held in perhaps the most favorable American location for Mexico, CONCACAF ticket allocations have attempted to keep things even.\nAs for an even crowd, Howard says he will believe it when he sees it, and is preparing for the atmosphere of a road game.\nThe 36-year-old’s preparation is unaltered by the prospect that he may be making the journey across the Atlantic for nothing more than a training camp followed by offering encouragement from the sidelines.\nHe took time off from the national team after the World Cup in order to recharge and head coach Jurgen Klinsmann hinted that Brad Guzan will remain as the incumbent keeper for the Mexico clash before the situation is reevaluated following this game.\nYet that has not quelled Howard's desire to see the U.S. chalk up another victory over its fiercest rival. This interview took place three days before Howard’s Everton team drew 1-1 with its city foe Liverpool, following which Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was fired. The prospect of being at the thick end of two such pivotal games within a week had visibly gotten Howard buzzing with excitement.\nIf his input is restricted to an advisory role, he will make sure any of the younger or less experienced members of Klinsmann’s side know what to expect from Mexico.\n“They will play any card they can to try to get an edge,” Howard added. “The most important part for us is winning and trying to continue our dominance. That is something we hold dear to us, not letting that slip.\n“Mexico won the Olympics (in 2012), which I think they thought was the World Cup and they certainly paraded around like it was the World Cup, but it wasn’t. They were on the up and up and we answered that bell going into the 2014 World Cup in terms of where our qualifying position was,\n“We have done a great job over the last few years of making sure we have kept our heads in the game. You have to be prepared for some of Mexico’s antics. I don’t think that’s any secret.\n“When you look back for decades, the American player was so naïve. These Mexican players could get away with anything. They probably got a kick out of that. We are no longer rattled. We are no longer fazed by anything they do on the pitch. They used to be able to get under our skin. They can’t anymore. They used to be able to dominate us. They cant anymore.”\nHoward is a thinking man who surely has plenty of value to offer to the sport when he eventually retires, both as a commentator — he already does work for NBC — and hopefully, in soccer administration. Goodness knows, the political side of the game could certainly use some positive characters right now.\nYet it is weeks like these that really get him going. Weeks when emotions are high and hostile and the only possible outcomes are joy or disaster. As Saturday approaches, Tim Howard is ready to rumble, with a smile on his face masking a burning inner desire to crush a rival.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:42:09.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
