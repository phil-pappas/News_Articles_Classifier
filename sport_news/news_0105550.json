But he was hit, the ball popped free and Watts-Jackson caught it, broke a few tackles in the final yards and made it into the end zone.\nMichigan State improved to 7-0, 3-0 in the Big Ten. Michigan fell to 5-2, 2-1.\n\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under college football ,  michigan state spartans ,  michigan wolverines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:54:27.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
