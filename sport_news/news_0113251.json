The 6-foot-2, 208-pound LaFell, who is eligible to come off the physically unable to perform list this week after offseason foot surgery, arguably was the second-best receiver on the team last season behind Julian Edelman . He started slow (he didn’t have a catch until Week 3), but really came on down the stretch, finishing with 74 catches for 953 yards and seven touchdowns. There were seven regular-season games of five catches or more, including an astonishing 11 receptions on 11 targets for a season-high 124 yards and a touchdown in a 51-23 blowout of the Bears. He added 13 catches for 119 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the playoffs, including one in the Super Bowl against the Seahawks . But after spending the offseason in a boot because of foot surgery, he was sidelined for the spring and summer workouts and was placed on the PUP list prior to the start of the regular season. In his absence, the New England offense still has managed to operate with the efficiency of a finely tuned sports car. Brady and the Patriots are averaging 325 passing yards per game with a 71 percent completion rate and 14 touchdown passes. Now LaFell is eligible to return, and while immediate expectations should be managed -- it’s going to take time for him to get up to speed, at least when it comes to game reps -- his presence should add another intriguing option to one of the best passing games in the league. For one, he offers a dependable intermediate and deep threat -- his 12.9 yards per reception last year was the most among any of the regular receivers. (The only other receiver in the 2014 New England offense who had more than 10 catches and averaged more than 10 yards per catch was Edelman at 10.6.) For an offense that’s been missing the threat of the home run ball over the first five games, the return of LaFell is akin to making a midseason trade to help bolster the passing game. “He’s definitely working hard,” Brady said of LaFell and his efforts to get back quickly. “He’s been a great contributor to our team since he got there. It’ll be fun when he’s back out there -- hopefully soon.” LaFell has been a conspicuous presence on the road over the last two weeks. Despite the fact that he was ineligible to come off PUP until this week, he traveled with the team to Dallas and Indianapolis, and engaged with the rest of the team in the pregame workout on the field. For a team that rarely takes visitors on the road, it was a sign of respect for LaFell, as well as a sign that he’s close to returning. LaFell declined an interview request on Wednesday, but by the sound of things, the receiver could be back soon. Asked about LaFell on Wednesday morning, Patriots coach Bill Belichick said, “In Brandon’s case, he’s a player that I think at some point will be back on the roster. We’ll see when exactly that is. I’m not sure. ” “The fact that he wasn’t with us in preseason and as it’s moving in that direction, being there on game day, going through the whole preparation, Saturday night, game day and so forth, I think it gets a player in a more comfortable mode when he actually does that,” Belichick added. “It’s kind of be the right setup, but I think it helps him and I think it helps the player that he’s trying to instruct.” LaFell practiced Wednesday, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he's been activated to the 53-man roster. (Teams have a 21-day window to activate a player or keep him on PUP once that player begins practicing.) But when he does return, it’ll be interesting to see how his workload impacts the rest of the offense. While Edelman, Rob Gronkowski and Dion Lewis will continue to get their share of opportunities in the passing game, it could mean fewer targets for the likes of Martin, Scott Chandler and Aaron Dobson. Ultimately, LaFell’s return adds an intriguing dynamic to an offense that already has spent the first five games of the season clicking on all cylinders. His addition could help kick things into overdrive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:31:46.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
