BALTIMORE – About the time the Yankees mounted a too-late seventh-inning rally at Camden Yards, the out-of-town scoreboard flashed some good news for Joe Girardi’s embattled club.\nAt Arizona, Diamondbacks slugger Paul Goldschmidt belted a go-ahead, two-run homer against the Astros.\nNeeding either a win or an Astros loss to earn the home field for Tuesday’s wild-card game, the Yankees – 9-4 losers Sunday against the Orioles – gladly accepted the Diamondbacks' gift on the final day of the regular season.\nArizona’s 5-3 victory over Houston gave the Yankees what they couldn’t do for themselves.\nThe Yankees will host the Astros in Tuesday’s one-game wild-card playoff to determine which club will advance to the Division Series against the defending AL champion Kansas City Royals.\nBut the Yankees (87-75) stumble into the tournament, having dropped six of their last seven games against the Red Sox and Orioles.\nYankees starter Michael Pineda (12-10) lasted just 3.2 innings, charged with four earned runs, while Orioles right-hander Chris Tillman (11-11) yielded two runs over 5.1 innings.\nThe Yankees trailed 7-1 after five innings. Baltimore (81-81) took a first-inning lead on Matt Wieters’ two-run single and Gerardo Parra had a two-run single in a three-run fourth.\nChris Davis’ two-run homer in the fifth off Bryan Mitchell gave Baltimore a six-run lead and the Yanks’ gaze was soon fixed on the out-of-town scoreboard in right field.\nDavis homered again in the eighth, his 47th of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:09:27.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
