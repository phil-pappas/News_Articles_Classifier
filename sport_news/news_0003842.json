Stewart isn’t interested in the same treatment. \n“Let’s establish this right now: I will not be coming to the media center every week to talk about it,” he said. “You can save your gifts. I’ve got enough rocking chairs at home. I’m not really that kind of guy. I’m content to go race and be around the racing community and the racing family and be around our fans. They can just send me a note from the track president and say, ‘Hey, thank you,’ and that’ll be sufficient for me.” \nStewart, who deeply loves dirt track racing, isn’t getting out of the car for good, though. He said he will still race in some capacity after 2016, and with a soft smile answered, “Maybe. Probably,” when asked if he’ll get back into a sprint car. Stewart has not raced a sprint car since August 2014, when his car struck and killed a young racer, Kevin Ward Jr., at a dirt track in upstate New York. \nHis planned departure is not a surprise. Stewart will be 45 next season, he hasn’t won a race in over two years and has been privately working on finding a successor for the No. 14 Chevrolet all year. \nClint Bowyer, released from his contract with Michael Waltrip Racing because the team is folding at the end of the season, will replace Stewart in 2017. Bowyer has been looking for a one-year deal while Stewart runs his 18th and final Cup season. SHR also fields cars for reigning series champion Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch and Danica Patrick. \nThe last three years have been trying for Stewart. The fatal incident with Ward last year took an emotional toll on him and he still faces a wrongful death suit from Ward’s family. He missed the final third of the 2013 season with a broken leg suffered in a sprint car crash. \nHis passion for NASCAR racing has also waned in the last several seasons, in part because of an evolving rules package that he has struggled with. He is currently 25th in the points standings and failed to qualify for the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship for the third consecutive year. \nEddie Gossage, president of Texas Motor Speedway and a close friend of Stewart’s, said the driver had discussed retirement with him “over the last six or eight years.” \n“I think he always viewed Cup racing as a job that helped him fulfill his passion for racing on dirt tracks, running world-famous Eldora Speedway or owning the All Star Circuit of Champions Sprint Car Series,” Gossage said. “I don’t know anybody that loves racing more. He’s a sure-fire, first ballot shoo-in for the NASCAR Hall of Fame.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:56:20.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
