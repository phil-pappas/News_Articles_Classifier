Wright, Jensen, Whiting and sophomore Parker Fetherston took top honors in the 200-yard medley relay, touching out in 2:06.08. Meanwhile, the same quartet won the 400 freestyle relay in 4:11.43. \nWright also dominated the freestyle events, winning the 50 free (:26.79) and 100 free (:59.41), while Jensen took top honors in both the 200 freestyle (2:12.50) and 100 backstroke (1:08.56). \nMeanwhile, Whiting earned runner-up honors in both the 200 IM (2:30.83) and 100 backstroke (1:10.40), while Hay was fourth in the 100 freestyle (1:09.41) while being part of the third place 200 medley and 200 freestyle relay teams. \n“We had a lot of PRs, which is good to see,” said Jefferson/Cambridge coach Hannah Peppey. “Hopefully more girls’ times will drop next Tuesday when we face Whitewater.” \nThe EagleJays will compete at Whitewater Tuesday. The Southern Lake Conference dual begins at 6 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:55:26.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
