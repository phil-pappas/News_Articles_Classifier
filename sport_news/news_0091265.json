Filed:   02:31   02:32 UK \nChicago Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg has confirmed that Derrick Rose will play in the season opener against Cleveland Cavaliers. \nThe point guard was injured in September but played 10 minutes in Friday's pre-season match against the Dallas Mavericks. \n\"I'm sure his adrenaline will get going a little bit and we'll make that determination. I don't know if he's going to have a restriction on how many minutes [he'll play].,\" Hoiberg told reporters. \n\"We play three [games] in four days to start this thing off, so we'll have to be a little bit careful with him just because he hasn't had a ton of reps out there. \n\"So I don't know exactly how many minutes he'll play on opening night, but it will be good to have him out there.\" \nLeBron James could be available for the Cavs if he shakes off a back injury.
