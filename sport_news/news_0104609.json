I asked him back in the spring how he was so successful as a pass rusher. He said the get-off was really key.\"\nAllen was traded to the Carolina Panthers after three weeks, and he had zero sacks as a Bear this year, but his advice to Jenkins is helping his former team.\nJenkins, a solid run defender in 33 starts over the previous three seasons with Washington, leads all Bears linemen with 16 tackles. But it's his contributions as a pass rusher that have raised eyebrows.\nHe's also second on the team with 5 quarterback pressures.\n\"You've got to get into the offensive linemen before they get into you,\" Jenkins said. \"If you can get them back on their heels, that's where you work your other stuff.\n\"If you don't get them on their heels, then you're a step back. The main thing I'm focusing on is getting that first step in the ground so I can get in the backfield a little quicker.\"\nImproving his get-off is the biggest reason for Jenkins' improved pass rush, but there are other factors.\n\"Film study,\" he said. \"If you know it's a pass, you can get off a little quicker. If you don't know if it's a pass or run, you can't really react as fast as you want to.\n\"It all comes from film study and knowing what you're going to get.\"\nBears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio has a reputation for putting players in the best position to succeed, and Jenkins feels at home in the 3-4, which is the same scheme he played in Washington.\n\"It's just being more comfortable,\" he said. \"When you get in Vic's defense, he puts you in a lot of positions where you can do different things.\n\"I've been real comfortable in that, and it's going good so far. Just need to keep it going.\"\nCoach John Fox expressed no surprise at Jenkins' pass-rush prowess and his all-around performance, practically scoffing at the notion that it has been unexpected.\n\"We don't hold 'em back,\" Fox said. \"They're free to go get the guy.\"\nFox did agree that Jenkins is among the players who have quickly found a comfort level in Fangio's defense.\n\"Knowing the defense,\" Fox said, \"guys can cut loose and not think. They're playing and reacting.\n\"And that position, your fight's right in front of you, so the technique and quickness and recognition, converting run to pass and pass to run, is critical. He's just getting more comfortable in our system.\"\nAlthough he never has had 3 sacks in a season -- both of his career sacks came in 2013 -- Jenkins is hungry for more.\n\"You're always going to be hungry to get to the quarterback,\" he said with his customary grin. \"Sacks are hard to come by. I've got to just keep pressing that and not get complacent. Three's definitely not enough.\"\nJenkins, who had 2 sacks against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 3 and 1 more last week against the Oakland Raiders, wants more sacks for his linemates as well.\nAs a team the Bears didn't have a single sack in their first two games, but they've got 6 in the past two games, including rookie nose tackle Eddie Goldman's first as a pro last week.\n\"I want Eddie to get 3 (this) week,\" Jenkins said. \"It's not about me; it's about our whole defense. If I keep my sacks up, it'll open up doors for the other guys to get sacks as well.\"\n• Follow Bob's Bears and NFL reports on Twitter @BobLeGere.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
