Cowart, who did not record a tackle against San Jose State, has not spoken publicly since arriving on campus and recently deleted his Twitter account.\nRELATED: Gus Malzahn addresses Byron Cowart's tweets\nMuschamp said there is a challenge in getting freshmen to understand they can play well without making their presence immediately felt in the box score. \"It's the instant coffee society,\" Muschamp said. \"Add water, put it in the microwave for 30 minutes and it's all going to work. That's really not the way it is all the time.\n\"He is playing at defensive line in the Southeastern Conference at a high level and will continue to improve and continue to get better, just like every other freshman I've ever coached that played as a freshman in the Southeastern Conference. There's been a bunch and he certainly is going to be a guy who is going to play at a high level.\"\nAuburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp: Oct. 7, 2015 Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp talks to the media after practice Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015, in Auburn, Ala.
