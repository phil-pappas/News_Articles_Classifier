Instead he rolled out the real thing for Monday night's 97-94 exhibition loss to the Miami Heat at AmericanAirlines Arena, sending out a San Antonio Spurs starting lineup of LaMarcus Aldridge, Tim Duncan, Kawhi...\n(Ira Winderman and #{text}) -- This time the second unit was Chris Andersen, Greg Whittington, Winslow, Green and Johnson.\n-- Johnson, playing ahead of Josh Richardson, provided a nice boost off the bench.\n-- You have to wonder if the Heat are auditioning Chalmers replacements while considering the luxury tax.\n--Richardson later entered in the fourth quarter.\n-- Which also is when James Ennis finally got his first look of the night.\n-- Whittington appears to be gaining on him.\n-- Green again displayed his ability to score in bunches.\n-- Green's fun to watch, even on his goal-tends.\nThe Heat hold on for 97-94 win over the Spurs in a preseason game at AmericanAirlines Arena on Monday night.\n(Joe Cavaretta) -- LaMarcus Aldridge on the Spurs just isn't fair.\n-- You have to wonder if David Stern were still commissioner if he would have voided the signing.\n-- Aldridge, though, had four fouls in 13 minutes. And, no, there are no bonus fouls in the preseason like summer league (although honestly, why not?).\n-- Still, Aldridge, Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard is about as good as it has gotten on the same front line anywhere in a while.\n-- The Heat again were without Hassan Whiteside due to his calf strain, and John Lucas III because of an ongoing hamstring issue.\n-- Even with Whiteside out, Spoelstra again opened with Wade, Dragic, Chris Bosh and Luol Deng.\n-- \"The four of the guys will be out there as much as we can,\" Spoelstra said of his four-fifths lineup continuity.\n-- That again had Udonis Haslem as the fill-in starter at center.\n-- Bosh, on playing in the absence of Whiteside, \"We're a little short, so I'm not really looking wins and losses as important. But moving the ball, continuing to execute and work on our pace and our execution is very important for us.\"\n-- Bosh said he still is overcoming the illness that held him out of practice over the weekend. \"It's getting there,\" he said. \"It always kind of lingers around a little bit. My body's feeling good.\"\n-- Of course, overcoming flu symptoms is nothing like overcoming last season's blood clot on his lung. \"It's way easier, man,\" Bosh said.\n-- Deng said it's important to appreciate the Heat as a work in progress. \"There's still a lot things we need to clean up,\" he said. \"Guys are getting familiar with each other, so that's why there's a lot of turnovers.\"\n-- Deng said with so many players missing time last season, there remains the matter of catching up to the rhythm of the game. \"A lot of guys, the game is coming back, in terms of the speed of the game,\" he said. \"So really, it takes time, but this is what preseason is about.\"\n-- But Deng said the Heat can't simply accept not being good enough with Whiteside out, \"I thought last year with the injuries and everything, we got away from executing, and I think it's something that we know if we want to get to the level that we want to get to, we've got to be able to execute even though guys are hurt.\"\n-- Three of the Heat's first four shots were threes. They missed all three.\n-- The Heat eventually fell to 1 of 7 on 3s, with the lone conversion by Dwyane Wade.\n-- Deng said the maturation of Justise Winslow has been impressive through this stage of camp. \"He's versatile,\" he said of the first-round pick out of Duke. \"He could guard two, three, maybe even one. He's strong. He's got the inside game. He's really good at cutting. He knows the game really well for a young kid.\"\n-- Spurs coach Gregg Popovich on why had no issue with Tony Parker playing for his national team this summer, at a time when Manu Ginobili was encouraged to sit, \"Tony, if he sits, the Duck pate and foie gras adds up.\"\n-- Popovich said David West will be the same in San Antonio as he was in Indiana, \"He's going to shot elbow jumpers.\"\n-- Popovich is expecting an easy adjustment to Aldridge, \"It's not like he's new. You know what he's doing.\"\n-- And from Popovich on Aldridge, \"We still haven't coached him. We just watch him.\"\n-- Spoelstra on the benefits of the preseason for his team, \"Obviously need to tighten up some things.\"\n-- Spoelstra said getting turnovers down remains the priority, \"Even before we get into what we're trying to do and how we're playing with the pace and the spacing, we have to value the ball, value the possession.\"\n-- Of turnovers, Spoelstra said, \"Sometimes singles are better than going for the home run, particularly after two or three tough possessions. We have to build that type of intuitiveness with our basketball game.\"\n-- Spoelstra reiterated that Dragic is his primary ballhandler, \"We want the ball in Goran's hands,\" he said. \"We want him to be aggressive. We want him to have more opportunities in the open court.\"\n-- But Spoelstra added, \"Just by the nature of our roster, there will be times that he has to play off the ball. But we want him to create that pace for us.\"\n-- For Spoelstra, Thursday's intrasquad public scrimmage will be handled like another game day. \"We'll treat Thursday like a game,\" he said, \"have a shootaround and come in for that.\"\n-- The Spurs were without Boris Diaw.\n--Asked pregame what was wrong with the forward, Popovich said, \"I don't care. When they tell me he can play, then I'll care.\"\n-- Floyd Mayweather was back in the house. Alas, no sign of Manny.\n Miami Heat San Antonio Spurs Gregg Popovich LaMarcus Aldridge Chris Bosh Hassan Whiteside Justise Winslow", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c5986/turbine/sfl-spurs-visit-heat-20151012-001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c5983/turbine/sfl-spurs-visit-heat-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c594d/turbine/sfl-miami-heat-san-antonio-spurs-blog-s101215", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c5a33/turbine/sfl-miami-heat-san-antonio-spurs-s101215", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c5989/turbine/sfl-spurs-visit-heat-20151012-002"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:13:58.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
