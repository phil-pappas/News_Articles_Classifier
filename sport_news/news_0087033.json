In the same interregnum, the national average rose to 6,083, 6,555 and 8,808 per month respectively. The online applications are a small fraction of the number of persons joining the RSS as most do so by simply walking to the nearest shakha.\nRSS prachar pramukh (head of publicity) Manmohan Vaidya said \"The Sangh's appeal among younger persons reflects a growing urge among youth to connect with India's cultural identity and take pride in it. It also shows a desire to serve society.\"\nPointing to the online applications from Bihar and an increased presence in shakhas there, Vaidya said \"The youth seem to be increasingly fed up with the communal politics of the so-called secular leaders.\"\nThe average per month requests has risen from 1,000 in 2012, 2,500 in 2013 to a high of 7,000 in 2014, when the election and the Modi campaign generated considerable interest in the BJP and the Sangh.\nIf the numbers of those who join shakhas is taken into account, the Sangh seems to be on a strong footing. Going by the number of new entrants who express a desire to train for RSS work, some 80,000 volunteers in the 13-40 age group participated in seven-day training camps in 2013 and the number went up to 1,15,000 in 2014.\nSangh leaders estimate that about one in six new recruits opt for the more rigorous \"prathamik shiksha varga\" or seven day camps, pointing to around 6 lakh new entrants to the RSS in 2014 and about 5 lakh in 2013.\nVaidya said that the camps as intended for persons who are keen to be assigned to particular tasks and are ready for a more detailed and rigorous intellectual and physical training exercises.\nThe rise in RSS's recruitment is interesting as the saffron organisation's regimen of physical training and a dress code of white shirts and flaring shorts - though not required for every day meetings - would seem at odds with the preferences of modern youth.\nBut the steady stream of new entrants, including urban youth, indicates that the Sangh's \"nationalist\" ideology and an increase in the BJP's profile has imbued the saffron outfit with a new found appeal.
