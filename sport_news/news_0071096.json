But at the end of the day, we were also really competitive last year and we upset them in the district semifinal. And I think our girls are very confident that they can rise up to that challenge again and do the same thing. We're just going to build on what we did last year and hopefully that will carry us through the playoffs.\" \nThe Zephyrs hung with Parkland for almost 60 minutes on Wednesday night before the Trojans tallied five goals in the final 22 minutes to secure the second 5-0 win of the season over Whitehall. \n\"They're going to be a tough team to play in the playoffs. But I think we'll be ready,\" Weitzman said. \"The girls know coming out of that first half against them that they can play with them. I think we'll try to use that as a little stepping stone for us to get in and hopefully see them in the playoff picture.\" \nWith the loss of top scorer Kourtney Cunningham from last season's district championship squad, Weitzman is happy with the way the regular season played out for the Zephyrs, who will begin Eastern Pennsylvania Conference tournament play on Saturday. \n\"We're really excited about the season we had,\" Weitzman said. \"To go 12-3-1 on the season, if you would have asked me if we would be 12-3-1 back in July or August, I would've probably said no way. We accomplished a lot of good things too. Part of the goals we set as a team early in the year were to get to the EPC playoffs and the district playoffs and we're there. So now it's a whole new season for us and we'll see what happens.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:53:29.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
