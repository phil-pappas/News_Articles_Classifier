To watch the transformation they’ve made to themselves … I’m glad I’m a part of it.\n“It’s impressive, it’s inspiring. We’ve got some really good guys in this locker room. They’re all playing for one another.”\nTannehill has certainly been a new man under Philbin. On Sunday, he completed an NFL-record 25 consecutive passes stretching over two games.\nHe ended the game with 18 of 19 completed passes for 282 yards and matched a career high with four touchdown passes.\n“I thought Marino walked out again,” quipped Campbell, referring to Dolphins great Dan Marino, the team’s starting quarterback for nearly two decades.\n“Two weeks in a row, he’s been on it. He throws to the open receiver, he manages the game well, he’s smooth, he’s comfortable. Receivers got open for him (and) he made some very good throws.”\nThe Dolphins scored a franchise record 41 points in the first half, while holding the 2-5 Texans scoreless.\nA bad day for the visitors got even worse in the fourth quarter when running back Arian Foster suffered a season-ending Achilles tear after collapsing to the field without any contact with an opposition player.\nThere will be sterner tests for the Dolphins, perhaps none more so than on Thursday when they face division rival New England Patriots, the defending Super Bowl champions.\n“We really need this win,” Campbell said. “We are capable of beating this team. They are not going to be easy. They never are.”\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Larry Fine )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:33:27.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
