Important star midfielder Aaron Ramsey aggravated a hamstring injury while chasing down the ball. Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger has ruled him out for at least a month. \nPrior to the Gunners fixture against Everton, Wenger said : “He [Aaron Ramsey] is alright but very down because he told me that his hamstring is quite a tough one. He’s out.” \nAccording to ESPN FC, Arsene Wenger doesn’t believe that Aaron Ramsey will return until after the next international break is completed in November. \n“[Ramsey] had a scan today but he’s out. I believe he will be out until after the next international break.” \nAaron Ramsey has two goals and no assists on 9 shot attempts this 2015-16 season across all competitions. \nRamsey and Arsenal are currently in second place in the Premier League table with 19 points. \nPaul M.
