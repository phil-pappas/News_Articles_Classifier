Both goals were scored in the second half at the 71st and 81st minute respectively in the game that was clearly dominated by the Burundian team. The second half kicked off after 40 minutes of delay of heavy rain that inundated the stadium lawn due to poor drainage system at the Prince Louis Rwagasore stadium, Xinhua reported. Burundi won the first leg game 1-0 in Victoria, capital of Seychelles on October 7. Burundi will play next the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) on November 8, in the first leg game .
