Related Red Sox beat Yankees in 11 innings \nKluber (9-16) ended his rocky season with a strong performance, allowing three hits and striking out nine. The right-hander, who won the AL Cy Young Award last season, recorded his first victory since Aug. 14. \nSantana led off the second with a home run while Raburn's homer started the fourth. Both landed several rows deep in the bleachers in left field. \nCraig Breslow (0-4) gave up both home runs, his only mistakes in 5 1/3 innings. The veteran left-hander made his second career start after 522 relief appearances. \nCody Allen pitched the ninth for his 33rd save. \nBoston designated hitter Brock Holt left the game in the seventh inning after being hit by a pitch on the left knee. He immediately went down and stayed on the ground for several moments. Holt was helped to the dugout by manager Torey Lovullo and a trainer. \nThe start of the game was delayed by rain for 30 minutes. Showers continued throughout the night, making the 49 degree temperature even more uncomfortable for the crowd of 17,342. \nKluber, who struck out seven in the first three innings, didn't allow a hit until Travis Shaw's one-out single in the fourth. Sandy Leon singled in the fifth and eighth. \nKluber's difficult season took another downward turn when he strained his right hamstring and missed three weeks in September. He was winless in his next three starts, allowing 10 earned runs in 13 2-3 innings. \nDustin Pedroia, who missed 42 games with a strained right hamstring earlier this season, was scratched with the cold and wet conditions. David Ortiz, who hit his 37th home run Friday, was also out of the lineup. \nRed Sox rookie center fielder Mookie Betts drew a first-inning walk and has reached base in 36 consecutive games. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nRed Sox: Lovullo said 3B Pablo Sandoval (pneumonia) is improving and added \"all of his symptoms are moving away.\" \nIndians: INF Zach Walters had surgery Friday for a torn labrum in his left shoulder. He was injured during the International League playoffs. \nUP NEXT \nRed Sox: RHP Rick Porcello has made 20 career starts against the Indians, going 9-3 with a 3.40 ERA. All the appearances came with Detroit. \nIndians: RHP Danny Salazar held the Red Sox to one run in seven innings in an 8-2 win at Fenway Park on Aug. 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:53:00.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
