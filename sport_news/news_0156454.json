After Dustin Ackley's two-run homer made it 6-4 in the first, Porcello allowed just two hits over the next seven innings - and one of them was an infield single. Carlos Beltran hit an RBI double, and Dustin Ackley had a two-run homer. \n\"That led to a tougher inning for him\", said Girardi, noting that Pineda's damaging pitches were \"up and flat\". \"We were just putting good swings on a few good balls and just trying to go out there and do everything we can\", Swihart said . In warmups and everything I felt fine, I was locating the ball fine. \"And I was thinking, That's going to track back a little further, and it got lost in the stadium lights and I was like, Oh shit, that's coming right at me \". \nWith his father and brother among dozens of supporters in the stands, Rick Porcello certainly didn't want to get knocked out in the first inning. \nBaltimore mustered just six hits on the afternoon with not a single player accounting for multiple hits. \"He's getting his pitch and not missing it\", said Lovullo. Porcello rebounded with a strikeout of Chase Headley ending the inning. The next day's first inning by the Yankees was even more impressive as they had four hits and scored four runs.\nThe Sox tacked on a seventh run to lead off the fifth on a home run by Betts, and Swihart put it away with another homer, this one a two-run blast to right against Bryan Mitchell. \nDH David Ortiz had the day off Monday. Take the latter because this late in the game the Yankees are not resembling a team of the first half that got them to be where they are. Porcello last faced the Yankees September 1 in Boston and during a 3-1 loss, he struck out 13 while allowing three runs (one earned) and five hits in eight innings. \"He seemed to find it after that\". \"They jumped all over him\". During McCann's subsequent at-bat, Gardner stole second base. \"There's not alarm. Let's make it clear\", Rodriguez said . \n\"There's not alarm. Let's make it clear: That team is playing really good baseball\". \"We're just going to go out and go play and do what we're doing\", Betts said. I like where we're at. Among the relievers who appeared in the games , Alexi Ogando 62 App. 4.19 ERA , Tommy Layne 62 App. 4.08, Junichi Tazawa 61 App. 4.14 ERA , the news isn't much better. \nAccording to the Boston Herald , the Red Sox are essentially hosting tryouts for the 2016 team with their remaining games this season. The Houston Astros slipped a half-game behind the Angels. 24 at 62-61, but battled its way out of a funk to pull within 3 1/2 games of the AL's second wild card. \"I can't explain it\". \nIt worked. Lovullo chatted with the president and they took a photo. \"To me, that was my best start all year\", he said. \"It couldn't have been more at ease.\"... Drew hasn't started in two weeks, with dizziness one of his symptoms, and thinks he probably has a concussion.
