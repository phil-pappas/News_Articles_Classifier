Colorado's Gabby Simpson led the both teams with 16 kills and hit .387 with four errors on 31 attacks. Alexis Austin added 14 kills while hitting .433 with just one error on 30 swings. \nColorado is now 10-6 overall and 2-2 in the Pac-12. \n\"We accomplished what we set out to do on this road swing, which is return home with two Pac-12 wins, which is never an easy feat,\" CU coach Liz Kritza said. \"After the long match on Friday, we focused on playing much more efficiently and not getting behind and having to mount another comeback. Striking first was essential to our success today.\" \nThree Buffs hit .500 in the contest, including Anna Pfefferle (nine kills and two errors on 14 attacks), Nicole Edelman (four kills on eight errorless attacks) and Naghede Abu (six kills and one error on 10 swings). Edelman, a senior, also had 36 of CU's 49 assists. \n\"Our offense was very effective today, and Nicole did a very good job of getting hitters going and keeping the offense firing throughout the entire match,\" Kritza said. \"Both Anna and Naghede handled their workload in the middle with great aplomb and we look for their continued contribution as well.\" \nColorado came up with 45 digs and four blocks. Cierra Simpson led the team with 14 digs and also added seven assists. Edelman picked up eight digs and Austin added seven. Abbie D'Agosta and Simpson each collected six digs. Pfefferle led the charge at the net, posting one block solo and two block assists.
