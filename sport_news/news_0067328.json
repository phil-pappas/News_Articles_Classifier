And over the weekend on NPR’s \"Only a Game,\" I doubled down, saying the Cubs were best -positioned to win a World Series in the next five years. Better than the Blue Jays, even? Read on, True Believers ... \nWhen writing about the 2016 Blue Jays, the first thing you have to mention is that when it comes to run differential, the 2015 Blue Jays lapped the field. At +221, the nearest American League team was the Astros (+111) while the Cardinals (+122) were tops in the National League. \nOf course run differential isn’t everything — even leaving aside October, I mean — but the Jays also paced the majors in BaseRuns and third-order winning percentage. If you don’t know exactly what that means, please trust me: What it means is that aside from wins and losses (and October), the Jays did more good things than anybody else this year. \nWhich is both a mark of distinction and predictor of success. \nFor the players involved, anyway. For the Blue Jays, the problem is that a bunch of those players aren’t contractually bound to the club for next season. \nNow, the lineup’s basically set. There will be some tinkering, perhaps. But for the most part, the guys you saw last week will be the same guys you see next spring. The only worries there are durability, as some guys who hadn’t usually been healthy were healthy for most of the season. And it does seem unlikely that Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion will again combine for 120 home runs. \nStill, these are quibbles. The Jays led the majors in scoring this year, and they should be up there again next year. \nIt’s the pitching that makes it impossible, right now, to say anything except that the Jays should be good next year. For great, management’s got a ton of work to do this winter. \nAt the end of the regular season, the rotation would have looked like this is rearranged in order of talent: \n1.
