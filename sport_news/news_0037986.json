The Centre has not fully approved the detailed project report (DPR) cost submitted by the state for electrification of households under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Jyoti Yojna. In a written reply in the Upper House today, the Power Development Department (PDD) said 1,09,175 households in the Kashmir valley and Ladakh region were yet to be electrified. Kupwara district has 32,577 such households, Kargil 11,545 and Shopian 10,715. Similarly, there are 1,87,169 households without electricity in the Jammu region. The state had demanded funds to the tune of Rs 1,249 crore, but the Centre had approved DPRs for only Rs 530 crore for the entire state. “Electrification of these households has been kept under the recently announced Central scheme. The DPR cost for all districts of Jammu and Kashmir submitted by the PDD is Rs 1,249.7 crore,,” the PDD said in reply to a question submitted by Shahnaz Ganai of the NC. “However, the monitoring committee of the Government of India, in its meeting on August 6, approved DPRs only for Rs 530 crore for the entire state,” it was stated in the reply. The government had been persuading the case for full sanction of DPR cost with the Centre, following which all households could hope to get electric supply. On the query over steps being taken for the transfer of the NHPC, Salal, Uri and Dulhasti power projects to the state, the reply said as per the agenda of alliance, the government had promised to explore modalities for transfer of Dulhasti and Uri projects to the state as suggested by Rangrajan Committee report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:05:20.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
