Prior to the drive, the Scots (4-0, 1-0) had gained just 25 yards in the second half, and had collected just one first down since Pittenger and Williams hooked up for a 34-yard score with 9:21 left in the first half.\n\"Methodist's defense did a great job,\" Pittenger said. \"Their defense made a lot of adjustments at halftime, and we didn't execute very well on a few plays. We knew the whole time that we were going to have our shot, and we took it at the end.\"\nThe Scots still had that shot thanks to their defense, which forced three turnovers and held the Monarchs (2-2, 0-1) to field goals on three separate occasions. They forced three punts in the fourth quarter, and defensive lineman Zach Capehart sealed the win with a fourth-down sack of Dylan DeGroot with 48 seconds remaining.\n\"We were over on the sidelines when the offense scored, and we were all saying, ‘We've got a minute and a half to give it all we've got,' \" Capehart said. \"It was every man cutting loose and getting after it, and we made a lot of plays.\"\nEarly on, it didn't look as if the Scots would have to sweat out the final result. They jumped out to a 21-0 lead behind a 2-yard rushing score by Deshijon Whitlock, a 24-yard TD pass from Nick Myers to Logan Winders, and Pittenger's first connection with Williams.\nThey led 21-3 at halftime, but the Scots struggled in the third quarter, especially on special teams. A fumbled punt return gave Methodist the ball at Maryville's 20-yard line early in the third, and the Monarchs scored their lone offensive touchdown three plays later.\nOn their next possession, the Scots fumbled while trying to punt, and JD Stalvey pulled the ball out of the air and walked into the end zone for a score. Brandon Torres hit field goals of 45 and 31 yards to give his team a 23-21 lead, setting the stage for the Scots' comeback.\n\"We told the guys this morning, that the power of belief is undefeated,\" Maryville coach Shaun Hayes said. \"These guys on the sidelines completely believed in each other the whole game. There was not a moment that I thought we would lose that football game.\"\nMitch Worthington is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:37:20.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
