To do it here, at Madison Square Garden, it's a pleasure,” said Ehlers, who has a goal and three points in four games to start his NHL career. “(Drew) Stafford was in front of the net, taking the sight of Lundqvist away from him there. He couldn't see anything at all, so I tried to shoot far side.” \nEhlers,19, seems to be gaining confidence by the day and his offensive creativity has been on display through the first four games of the campaign. \nAfter putting up consecutive 100-plus point seasons with the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, Ehlers was expected to contribute offensively and he's looked right at home on the Jets second line with Mark Scheifele and Mathieu Perreault. \n“That kind of energizes your team, when you see a guy get his first career goal,” said Jets centre Bryan Little. “It was one of the nicer ones I've ever seen.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:57:10.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
