Although just because you don't have a replacement, doesn't mean you don't have a legitimate point, I will make it easier for y'all and suggest potential replacements if he were to get fired. (Listed in no particular order) \nTom Herman \nHe was the offensive coordinate at Ohio State when they won it all. Their offense seemed unstoppable at times last season. And he did one thing Mark can't do. He beat Bama. Ohio State had control of that game from start to end. It seemed as if the Crimson Tide defense didn't have an answer for Tom Herman's offense. Currently, Tom Herman is the Head Coach of the Houston Cougars. I have watched film of them and they seem pretty impressive. Oh yeah, and did I mention they are currently undefeated? They also have a good win against Louisville. I think he can coach well. If you look at Ohio State's offense before and after he left, it is a night and day comparison. \nTodd Monken \nHe is the head coach of Southern Miss. I watched them play against Mississippi State. He is something Mark Richt is not; he is aggressive. Mark Richt is way too conservative but if you saw Southern Miss that day, then that is the kind of aggressiveness you want when playing a game. He inherited a dumpster fire of a program from failed head coach Ellis Johnson that went 0-12 and now they look like a potential C-USA champion. \nSean Payton \nHe's the head coach of the Saints. He has won a Super Bowl, and remember that you must be pretty good to be one of the 32 coaches at the highest level of football. The Saints aren't doing so well right now so if he is let go, that would be a snag for Georgia. \nBob Stitt \nHe is an up and coming coach who currently works for the University of Montana. Previously, he has had major success at the Division II school, The Colorado School of Mines. A lot of coaches reference him as being a good coach. He even upset the 4 time in a row FCS National Champions, the North Dakota State Bison. \nKirby Smart \nThis guy has been the backbone of Nick Saban's defense for years. I think he is either waiting for a job opening at Alabama or Georgia. If we could get him and keep Pruitt as the DC, then that would be a steal. Unlike Richt, this guy has National Championships under his belt, and can win the big game. \nJeremy Pruitt \nThis guy has coached under Saban, and led a remarkable Florida State defense to a national title. He is currently our DC. as y'all know. I think he has the winner mentality. \nMike Leach \nHis offenses put up big numbers. He had major success at bottom dweller Texas Tech. He is now at Washington State and has been struggling a bit, but Wazzu always struggles. However, they did upset Oregon last night. I think this guy also has a winner mentality. Unlike Richt, he can motivate a team. He has a lot of positive energy and actually wants to win. \nChip Kelly \nHis experiment in the NFL has been a failure. When he (most likely) gets fired at the end of the year, we could welcome him back to the collegiate level. He is a good college coach and has a good system. He's been very successful at Oregon (and maybe we could get some snazzy uniforms). He led the ducks to a national championship appearance against Scam Newton [sic]. His offenses have been very prolific. \nKyle Whittingham \nKyle has done something Mark can't do. He beat Nick Saban's Crimson Tide. He has brought a consistency of success to Utah and right now they look like the best team in the country. If Utah was in a Power 5 conference some of those previous years, who knows, they might have won a national title. \nArt Briles \nHe brought success to the dumpster fire of a football program known as Baylor. Baylor has been an utter disaster until Art went down to Waco. My only criticism of him is that he seems to choke in bowl games, so beware. And for those of you who like Richt because \"He's a good Christian man\", Art Briles is also a good Christian man. \nWhat are you opinions on these potential replacements? Comment below and also vote on the poll. Poll Who do you think would make a good replacement to Coach Mark Richt?
