The contingent from Nepal which comprised artists representing both the traditional and modern art of that country was led by Nagendra Prasad Paudyal, an artist, whose paintings were on display at the exhibition. His paintings depict Lord Shiva in all its glory reigning over the Universe as Jagat Pati (See Photo). The Universe is a floating mass of red, blue and green plus yellow colours which respectively portray fire and power to peace and tranquility to health, fertility, courage and personal power. A mix of all this is cosmos and over it is superimposed Lord Shiva as the deity who has compelled order on the universe. The reverberating sound of Om is juxtaposed between the red and the blue; the power and the peace - a word can bring war and it can bring amity. Yellow showing health and fertility has a conch-shell that is blown during sweet and sorrowed times reminding humans that in happy hunting do not forget the all pervading Shiva because sad shadows always wait in the wings. A bell painted over the red colour on the bottom right represents a wake up or shake up call when one becomes lusty for power. Nagendra was positive towards the Nepal government's efforts in promoting the arts there. He said a Lalit Kala Academy was established at Kathmandu about nine years back and fine arts was being taught in almost all private schools though the government schools were lagging behind. He told me that four out of the 12 artists participating in the festival were teachers. Tribhuvan University at Kathmandu had started the Master in Fine Arts (MFA) course in 2010 and Nagendra, at the age of 48 years, was the oldest to get the MFA degree in the first batch. Nagendra's information acquainted me with the artistic world of Nepal. He told me that Nepal had quite a few internationally known artists. Shashikala Tiwari is one of them. Her works deal with Hindu and Buddhist mythologies, women's issues and the images of nature. She has been the victim of social disharmony of the contemporary society of Nepal and so her works depict her quest for a peaceful and harmonious living together. Madan Chitrakar is the best known name in the present day contemporary Nepal Art. Native cultural elements expressed in innovative style and form is his forte. Batsa Gopal Vaidya is pained to see the loss of heritage and his main concern is preservation of heritage in the rapidly changing urban society of Nepal. He, through his paintings, captures his immediate surroundings in which the culture and heritage dominate. I was highly impressed by the traditional art 'Paubha' of Nepal. Two artists who brought their works here were Ram Prakash Shreshtha and Bijai Ratna Bajracharya. Tara Devi built in Paubha style by Ram was exquisitely done piece. But here is Adhivasan Mandala by Bijai (See Photo). Paubha is a traditional religious painting made by the Newar people. It is said that these Newar artists took the Paubha art to Tibet from where the Tibetan thangka art evolved. Most Paubhas have Buddhist theme but a few are done on Hindu subject. Those who do Paubha belong to a particular Chitrakar caste known as Poon in Nepal. Adhivasan means to welcome the deity before a yajna and Mandal is Sanskrit term meaning circle. It is a cosmic disc or wheel manifested in art tradition as one of the central symbols of the oriental civilization. Etymologically the term Chakra is derived from root 'kra' which means to create and implies the idea of movement. Adhivasan Mandala means to bring the deity with total respect to the Mandala and then blow life into it. The artists told me that though it was a subject of research and in-depth study yet Paubha art form dated back to the 7th century. The oldest known survivor of the 13th century, however, was a figure of Ratna Sambhav with Los Angeles County Museum. Our oldest Pahari Painting is 'Devi Mahatamya' of 1575 CE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:14:59.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
