They will have a tough time trying to stop the Manhiem Township offense. \nThe Blue Streaks are on a four game winning streak and a huge part of their success is their quarterback, Erik Benjamin. He ranked one of the top passers in the Quad A with 16 touchdowns and only two interceptions. \nBenjamin has a lot of weapons to work with. The offense has been tough for most teams so far this season to stop.
