Amritsar Senior Superintendent of Police (rural) Jasdeep Singh Saini said police received a call from the priest of a gurdwara at Nijjarpura late last night that three persons forcibly entered the shrine and tore the pages of the holy book. \"The statement of priest appeared false following which he was interrogated by police in front of other people working in the shrine,\" he said. Jagdeep Singh, the 30-year-old 'granthi', confessed that he had committed the crime and had tried to mislead the police, Saini said. \"The perpetrator of crime, who himself is the granthi of gurdwara, has been arrested,\" the SSP said, adding the situation is under control. Punjab has recently witnessed protests over a series of incidents of sacrilege especially in Faridkot, Ferozepur, Ludhiana and Tarn Taran districts. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:08:05.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
