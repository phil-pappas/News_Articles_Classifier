Several hours after a punch by then-teammate IK Enemkpali fractured Geno Smith’s jaw on Aug. 11, Jets coach Todd Bowles was barraged with questions about how long Smith’s successor, Ryan Fitzpatrick, might hold onto his new job and if Bowles believed players can lose their starting positions due to injury. \nAnswering one of those many questions, Bowles said, \"If the other guy is playing well and the boat is going right and there are no waves and everything is going and we’re 4, 5, 6, 7-0? Yeah, you’re not coming back to start.\"\nWell, the first-year coach wasn’t quite clairvoyant. The Jets are 3-1 heading into Sunday’s game against Washington, but that record is more than good enough for Bowles to stick with the veteran Fitzpatrick.\nFitzpatrick’s raw numbers aren’t exactly eye-catching. He ranks 27th in the NFL in completion percentage with 60.7 percent accuracy, and his passer rating of 78.1 also places him 27th in the league.\nHe is tied for 12th in touchdown passes with seven, despite many of his NFL counterparts already having played one more game than Fitzpatrick and the Jets.\nHowever, he also has thrown six interceptions, tied for third-worst. But here’s an interesting oddity that has helped the Jets win three of their first four games: None of Fitzpatrick’s picks has led to a score by the opposition.\nIt also can be argued that of the six interceptions, three weren’t really his fault. In the Jets’ lone loss to Philadelphia, Fitzpatrick had one interception that occurred because the ball was tipped near the line of scrimmage. That happened because right guard Brian Winters allowed pressure from his defender, who deflected it.\nLater in that same game, Fitzpatrick was on target to Brandon Marshall, but the star wideout let the ball sift through his fingers and it was intercepted. However, give Marshall credit for erasing the potential effect of Fitzpatrick’s first pick of the season by stripping Cleveland’s Tashaun Gipson of the ball and recovering it to preserve a Jets scoring drive.\nAgainst Miami, Fitzpatrick had a deep pass picked off by Zack Bowman, but it appeared Bowman had shoved rookie receiver Devin Smith to the ground before making the play. No penalty was called despite the contact.\nPart of the reason Fitzpatrick’s picks haven’t proven to be costly is that most of them have been on deep passes. Still, the 11th-year pro needs to become more consistent on his long throws. Even his 58-yard completion to Marshall against Miami, the Jets’ longest play from scrimmage of 2015, was underthrown slightly. The one major advantage Smith has over Fitzpatrick is arm strength.\nQuarterbacks coach Kevin Patullo said Monday he isn’t worried about that aspect of Fitzpatrick’s game.\n\"Certain times we ask him to throw the ball deep\" because of the game plan, Patullo said. \"Other times we have go routes or something on the outside [secondary patterns] and he takes a chance because the coverage might dictate it or depending on the score. It’s all kind of relative and I understand sometimes it looks bad. … But it shouldn’t really be an issue; it’s really not right now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:17:38.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
