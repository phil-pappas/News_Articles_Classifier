Volunteers gave out hundreds of coats and less than a week later, the temperature dropped to 17 below zero. \n\"And the day of the giveaway, there were some children that came with just sweatshirts. That's all they had, and had we not been able to give them coats and hats and what they needed, they would have been out there with just a sweatshirt,\" Pastor Lou Whitmer said. \nDonors give adult coats as well. Still, volunteer Carol Fowler says she has a heart for the children who come. As a retired teacher, she has seen the need firsthand. \n\"Yes I have and that's why this year we're starting to do the snow pants as well,\" Fowler said. \nA grant through the Dakotas Conference of the United Methodist Church will provide new snow pants to kids this year. That's an addition to the annual coat drive. \nIn a given year, the church will receive somewhere around 1,000 coats. Up to 600 of those will go to families in the Aberdeen area. The rest go to an organization in Mission, South Dakota. \nThe involvement is community-wide with collection sites at multiple churches, banks and stores in Aberdeen. \n\"Every year we get more and more calls from people, 'Are you the church that does the coats?’ and, ‘I have coats,'\" Whitmer said. \n\"We have wonderful participation and the closer it gets to the giveaway, the more coats we have,\" Fowler said. \nThis year that giveaway takes place at the end of October, in time, organizers hope, to beat the subzero temperatures in northeast South Dakota again. \nThe coats serve a variety of community members. Whitmer says sometimes working families with multiple kids will come. Other times people who've moved to Aberdeen from warmer climates will walk through the doors, not prepared for the cold weather of northeast South Dakota. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
