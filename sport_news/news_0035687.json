You look to last year, when TCU went on the road to Kansas, and Kansas almost got them there. So it’s great to point out that it is a good football team that’s well-coached, and they had a tough run, but they’re getting better. They have young players. So we just need to continue to get better ourselves.” \nWhile Tech’s offense, which threw up a school-record 776 yards last week against Iowa State, is rolling, it’s the defense that has Kingsbury hammering home the importance of being focused from start to finish. Tech enters today giving up an average of 40 points per game. And even though KU (0-5) is averaging just 19 per contest, TTU defensive coordinator David Gibbs said true freshman QB Ryan Willis has what it takes to put up points in a hurry. \n“(Their) freshman quarterback looked pretty good to me,” Gibbs said. “Did not look intimidated by Baylor, so we’ve got our hands full again. ... They’re looking at our film and thinking they’re going to score 50 points, and I would too.” \nWillis Part Deux \nNow that KU freshman Willis has made his first start and played his first complete game at quarterback for the Jayhawks, offensive coordinator Rob Likens believes Willis will be even better during his second start. \nLikens also knows the defense Willis faces be different, as well. \n“They do a lot of things to try to confuse you,” said Likens of Texas Tech. “Baylor was a little different. Baylor just lines up and says, ‘This is what I’m doing, come get me.’” \nLikens said Tech’s smorgasbord of styles defensively made for a much more extensive week of preparation for Willis and him in the film room and on the practice field. \n“Oh yeah,” Likens said. “It’s not easy at all. They vary their fronts, guys standing up, in a three-point stance, sometimes the same guy. And they’ll give you more secondary looks than what Baylor did.” \nSeries history \nTexas Tech is 15-1 all-time against the Jayhawks, including 6-0 in games played in Lawrence. \nKansas’ lone victory in the series came in 2001, when the Jayhawks outlasted the Red Raiders, 34-31 in overtime in Lubbock, Texas. \nTech favored \nAnother week brings another huge point spread for a Kansas football game, as the Red Raiders enter today’s game favored by 32.5 points. \nThe line opened at Texas Tech -27 and, like last week when Baylor opened at -38 and settled at -46 by kickoff, the spread quickly shot up with most of the action coming in on Tech to cover the four-touchdown total.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:53:17.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
