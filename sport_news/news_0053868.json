You can choose to be an owner, a coach, or a player, and while each option is similar, each choice brings its own set of goals and choices. For now though, I want to focus purely on the single player’s career mode option. With the selection of this option, it allows the user to create an individual or pick an existing player, and play out a full 15 years of your career. While this mode should be full of opportunities to live the hectic and exciting life of an NFL player, it fails miserably in almost every way possible at doing so. I want to take a look at five different areas within the player career mode in which the Madden developers could add some much needed depth and realism, and give users a reason to actually explore this mode. Presentation In any career mode, it’s extremely important for the focus to be player-centric. In a player-centric environment, the game is based on the individual, and how that player impacts the franchise, and vice-versa. In Madden though, you are literally just placed on the field with a camera-lock on your player, and asked to play the game from that perspective. Once the game is done, it’s literally wash, rinse, and repeat, without any type of implicit focus on your player. No cut scenes, no dialogue, and no feedback really detract from any type of immersion. Simple cut scenes showing your player walking onto the field, with the announcers talking about your possible impact on the upcoming game would go a long way in drawing the user in. Post-game highlights of what you accomplished would also have a nice impact, along with being able to pick and choose practice options that would allow you to gain player XP. Feedback There is literally zero feedback in player-only mode. Whether I grab 10 balls, have 12 tackles with a sack, or sit in the end zone and count how many fans are eating hot dogs, it doesn’t matter. Your player obviously has goals per game and season, and the amount of XP they receive is based on your on-field accomplishments (or lack thereof), but other than that there are absolutely no ramifications for performing well or poorly. As a rookie, if I continue to have poor outing after poor outing, I want there to be massive pressure placed upon me to perform well – you know, much like the real NFL. I want to have to earn the playing time I receive, and continue to perform well, to keep that position. Combine The NFL combine offers the perfect opportunity for Madden developers to showcase all the unique physical and mental tests that take place, and to place your created player in the middle of all of this would be outstanding. This would be a mode that would harken back to the 8-bit days of games like Track and Field, and could offer up the 40 yard dash, bench-press, vertical leap, agility, and much more. Of course, if it’s not implemented correctly it would be a huge wasted opportunity, but the rewards far outweigh the risks, at least for me they do. Also, based off of your performances each day, show what teams are gaining interest, losing interest, and projected slot in the upcoming draft. Game Face While NBA Live 16 may be a retail failure, they have at least implemented the game-face app correctly, and allowed users to easily create their likenesses within the game. While the game of football is impacted less than others by the use of helmets when it comes to facial exposure, it’s still a great feature to have the ability to put a close likeness of yourself into the game, and do so with such ease. Offseason routines Much like the real NFL, the amount of unseen work that is put in by the large majority of players has an incredible impact on their performance in the upcoming season. Even if the off-season regimen is only one of a text-based nature, there needs to be a grind mentality to it. Force me to put the time and effort in in order to advance my skills and knowledge of the game. Some may hate this type of approach, and for them maybe a simulate action button should be included, but have a bit less of an impact if not done manually. If you have had the opportunity to play other career modes in games such as NBA 2K or Sony’s MLB: The Show , then you have a full understanding of what a deep and interactive career mode can look like, and the possibilities that exist. While neither of the two games I mentioned have a career mode that I would describe as perfect, they both have taken chances and each show what is possible with ample time and effort. Please don’t assume I am not thinking correctly as I fully understand that player mode in Madden 16 is not to be confused with Superstar mode, an option was taken out. With that said, if you are going to bring back a true career mode in the Madden franchise, please put some serious effort into the mode and make it worth the user’s time. What would you like to see included in Madden's Superstar mode?
