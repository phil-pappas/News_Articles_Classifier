The crazy part about it, though, is they could very easily snag the sixth and final post-season berth in this most wacky of seasons.\nWinnipeg will host Ottawa (9-6) in a rematch on Saturday afternoon at Investors Group Field, and sweeping back-to-backs isn’t an easy feat to accomplish.\n“I’m extremely aware of all the math,” starting quarterback Matt Nichols said. “We win this week and the other two lose their next two, the last week doesn’t even matter. We’re in the driver’s seat for this playoff spot, and we just need to handle our business.”\nThe “other two” would be the B.C. Lions and Montreal Alouettes, who are both half a game ahead of the Bombers at 5-10 but would lose the tiebreaker against the Blue and Gold. That’s why the Bombers are talking confidently despite their terrible record.\n“Today we talked about not necessarily focusing on where we’ve come from but what lies ahead for us,” head coach Mike O’Shea said. “We’ve still got a great opportunity. They’re gonna realize that. At game time they need to realize that. I’m confident they will, and as an entire organization we gotta believe that we’re gonna make the playoffs.”\nBAD TIME OF YEAR\nWinnipeg has missed the playoffs three straight years and five of the last six, so this is the time of year when they usually get eliminated from contention.\nThe Blue and Gold’s playoff hopes were dashed in their 16th game of the season in 2010 and 2013, and it happened in their 17th contest in 2012 and 2014. They made it all the way to the final game of the 2009 campaign before missing out.\nThe Bombers can’t be eliminated from contention this week, and the only way they’ll be out by the time they return from their bye week is if they lose on Saturday, and one of the Lions or Alouettes win both of their next two contests.\nGLASS HALF FULL\nO’Shea is choosing to accentuate the positive of his team’s failed comeback on Friday in the nation’s capital.\nThe Bombers scored two touchdowns in garbage time to make the game appear closer than it actually was, but the Bombers head coach believes points are points and it’s something his team can take into Saturday’s rematch.\n“It’s interesting because the typical response would be they’re playing very soft in coverage, but when you think about it, if they’re playing that soft in coverage the linebackers got extra depth, and it just adds more guys into the picture to cloud the picture,” O’Shea said. “No defence wants to give up points at the end of the game. We managed to score a couple, so we’re not going to take that away from our team and their coach isn’t saying, ‘Don’t worry about it.’”\nIT’S ON ME\nNichols managed only 34 passing yards in the first half of Friday’s game when the RedBlacks threw a zone defence at him instead of the expected man coverage. He knows he needs to get off to a better start on Saturday.\n“For me it’s going out and making some better decisions and some better reads and some better throws,” Nichols said. “Your offence goes as your quarterback goes, so I need to come out and be better to start the game. I’m doing everything I can this week to make sure that that happens.”\nPICARD STILL HURTING\nThe Blue and Gold were missing three key players on the first day of practice for Saturday’s game against the RedBlacks, but only one might be unavailable.\nCentre Dominic Picard, who missed Friday’s game in Ottawa with an undisclosed injury, didn’t participate in Tuesday’s workout, and head coach Mike O’Shea said his veteran’s status is “not good right now. But you never know. I don’t like to rule anyone out.”\nSecond year centre Matthias Goossen made his second start at centre on Friday night, and the Bombers offensive line didn’t suffer because of it. It allowed just one sack against the league’s top quarterback hunters, and although O’Shea was quick to point out sacks don’t reflect solely on the offensive line, he said, “That was a pretty good job.”\nEven though Goossen played well by all accounts, O’Shea wasn’t ready to entertain thoughts of playing him the rest of the season just because he’s the team’s future at the centre position.\n“I’m not in that mode of saying: What’s best for the future?” O’Shea said. “We’re looking at winning a game and getting in the playoffs.”\nLeft tackle Stanley Bryant was absent from the practice because he was out of town dealing with a family issue, while slotback Nick Moore was on the field but didn’t participate.\n“He just needed a day,” O’Shea said.\nCanadian linebacker Graig Newman left Friday’s game in the first half but was back on the practice field Tuesday looking no worse for wear.\nBLUE BOMBERS\nBombers in driver's seat?
