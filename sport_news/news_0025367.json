Garza led the entire race but was challenged at the very end by teammate Jonathan Herrera, who crossed behind Garza with a time of 16:12.93. \n“I almost got him at the end,” said Herrera. “We started out together and then he took the lead and I stayed behind him, but at the end I decided to charge hard and try to beat him. I came up just short, but that’s OK. We ran as a team today, and that was our goal.” \nRaul Casiano crossed the finish line in third with a time of 16:53.70, and Emmanuel Guerrero came in fourth with a mark of 16:58.95. \nWith the win, the Raiders will make the return trip to the regional meet, where the team took third last year. Herrera said the team’s main goal this season was to not only return to the regional meet and win it, but to perform better at state. \n“We didn’t do so well at state last year, and that’s something we’ve been working on,” Herrera said. \nFor more on this story,   District 32-6A meet At San Benito Boys Team results: 1.
