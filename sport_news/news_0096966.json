Apparently, it's now a problem.\n\"That's what I get mad at, when I don't get looked at,\" Watkins told The Buffalo News. \"I can look at film and his eyes go straight that way and I'm not getting looked at, at all. That's when I get frustrated. When I have one-on-one coverage, go to me. I don't care what's going on over there. I don't care if he's open. When I get one on one, just target me.\"\nThe second-year receiver has five games with double-digit targets in the 19 NFL games he's played in. Watkins compares that to players like Julio Jones in Atlanta and Odell Beckham Jr. in Atlanta and can't help but wonder what he would do with consistently higher target numbers.\n\"Everybody looks at you getting zero catches, zero yards but when you look on film 90 percent of the time you're open,\" Watkins told The News. \"I understand that these guys are young and they need some time to trust me. Once we get that trust, it'll be different. But for me, I need the ball at least 10 times — I need 10 targets — and I'll be fine with however many yards I get. And that's what I addressed in talking with my agent. We reached out to a couple people and tried to pull some strings like, 'Hey, I need my targets. You came up to draft me and I'm not getting targets — that's a problem. You're making me look bad and you're making yourself look bad. Why not make both of us look good?'\"\nWhile Watkins certainly has a point, he also has to get on the field. He's missed the last two weeks with a calf injury that has one again limited him in practice this week. Watkins insists he's going to fight through the injury , because he thinks the Bills' offense is \"basic\" without him in the lineup.\nWatkins hasn't been shy about voicing his opinions. If he's able to suit up Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals, he may actually get a chance to show", "external_links": ["http://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/10/15/sammy-watkins-speaks-up-when-i-get-one-on-one-just-target-me/"], "published": "2015-10-16T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:10:14.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
