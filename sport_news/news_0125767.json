The Cardinals wrap up the 2015 season Friday at home against Nevada. Newton is 0-8 going into the Class 3A District 6 contest while Nevada is 2-6, but neither team has a district win. By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nFriday is Senior Night for Newton High football as the Cardinals host Nevada’s Cubs in the season finale for both teams. The Cardinals (0-8) and Cubs (2-6) are both winless in Class 3A District action at 0-5 apiece. \nAlso Friday at H.A. Lynn Stadium will be NHS junior cheerleader night and the Core Power Football Frenzy. Core Power is a high protein milkshake. The game between Newton and Nevada is one on the Core Power tour of Iowa high school football programs this season. \nWith all that swirling around them, the Cardinal football players are focused in snapping the team’s losing streak this season. Sixteen seniors lead the Cardinals onto their home field for the final time this season for the 7:30 p.m. kickoff. \n“These kids have practiced well for us and given us effort every week this season. They’ve continued to do so this week,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said. “These guys are a real joy to coach. We’ve had good senior leadership through the difficult set of circumstances this year.” \nNewton has been plagued with injuries to starters from the start of the season, putting the Cardinals in situations to use less-experienced and younger players. Ergenbright said the good side to it all was a lot of kids not expected to play have had the opportunity to play varsity football. \n“Overall, our kids have responded very well and have gotten used to having the next guy up being in there. We’ve adjusted and moved forward,” Ergenbright said. \nNewton and Nevada are both looking to use Friday’s game as a boost to the offseason and next season. The Cubs won their first two games of the season, beating Interstate 35 and Saydel. As with the Cardinals, the Cubs struggled in district action. \nNevada has the third-best passing attack in 3A District 6, led by junior quarterback Macade Matuska, who is 63-of-132 for 1,065 yards with 11 touchdown passes and four interceptions. Brendan Sellberg and Petyon Sharp each have more than 300 yards in receiving. Andrew Strottman is their leading rusher with 558 yards on 98 carries. \nNewton owns the third-best rushing offense in the district with 1,920 yards on 391 carries. Seniors Joseph Banfield and Dalton Nevels are fourth and 10th on the district rushing list. Banfield, who is a game-time decision after an ankle injury in last Friday’s game, leads Newton with 892 yards on 174 carries. Nevels had 555 yards on 83 carries. \n“The key to winning is we have to play much better on defense. Defense has been our liability all year. Our defensive coaches continue to work really hard to shore things up on that side of the ball,” Ergenbright said. “We’ve proven we can move the ball on offense. \n“We need to play a complete game — defense, offense and solid special teams play — to get one in the win column. Our players recognize this. Our seniors have provided leadership and have been good examples of how to respond to adversity. This senior group was a big part of our playoff team a year ago.” \nErgenbright said Nevada has changed to a spread offense with Matuska at the helm. \nNevada and Newton both struggle defensively. Senior linebacker Duncan Lee leads the district in solo tackles with 56 and is third in overall tackles with 71. \nNewton will be without senior defensive and offensive lineman Andrew Weiland, who is sidelined with an ankle injury suffered last week. Senior receiver Jake Bennett is another game-time decision after a shoulder injury at Bondurant. Senior linebacker Austin James is good to go as is junior lineman Alex Miller. \nThe lone 0-9 season posted by a Newton football team was in 1959. The 1940 season was winless as well, but the Cardinals played fewer games that year. \nIn 2009, Newton lost its first six games, then pulled out a 32-27 win on the road over Sioux City North. The Cardinals finished 1-8 that season, which was Newton’s final year in Class 4A football play. \nThe Newton junior cheerleaders will perform between the 4:45 p.m. freshman game and the varsity game Friday night. \nSamples of Core Power high protein milkshakes will be given to fans who stop by the Core Power Booth Friday. There will be fun yard games, and chances to win prizes. There will a halftime contest, where three Newton students will compete against one-another in the #EverydayAwesome race, for chances to win Core Power merchandise. Students have to complete pushups, spin around a dizzy bat and show off their touchdown dance moves. \nIn addition to the game festivities, Core Power will provide Newton football players with a bottle of Core Power for recovery after practice Thursday. Both Newton and Nevada teams will receive a cold Core Power shake following Friday’s game. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:40:27.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
