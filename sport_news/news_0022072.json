(AP) â€” A second University of South Florida football player is now accused of firing a gun on campus. University police arrested junior cornerback Lamar Robbins on Thursday. He remained in the Hillsborough County Jail early Friday with an $8,000 bond. Police say they arrested Robbins after an investigation into the Oct. 11 arrest of freshman player Benjamin Knox . Arrest reports say Knox fired a gun at a dorm on the campus near Tampa. In a statement Friday, university police say they spoke with Robbins early in the investigation and he gave false information. Earlier this week, USF suspended Knox, a reserve offensive lineman, from team activities. There is no word on Robbins' status. Robbins is charged with discharging a weapon on campus, a second-degree felony, and giving false information to a law enforcement officer. A lawyer for Robbins isn't listed on jail records.
