(REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) Royals force decisive Game 5 with late rally against Astros \nWith the Houston Astros on the verge of advancing in the baseball playoffs on Monday, a tweet was sent out in the name of Texas Governor Greg Abbott congratulating the team on its victory. Oops. \nThe wheels soon came off for the Astros, who just six outs away from a berth in the American League Championship Series, suffered one of the worst breakdowns in postseason history. The team's fans were left wondering if the Astros were cursed by the leader of the Lone Star State. \nWith the Astros up 6-2 on the Kansas City Royals entering the eighth inning, the tweet from @GovAbbott went out that read: \"Congrats to the @astros on advancing to the ALCS!. Hoping for an all-Texas #ALCS. Looking at you @Rangers.\" If I were a superstitious @Astros fan, I'd blame this 8th inning tweet from Texas Governor. #Royals pic.twitter.com/a76EaJOT3z — Jason Kander (@JasonKander) October 12, 2015 \nAfter that, the Royals, who were on the verge of elimination, scored seven unanswered runs, taking the game and tying the best-of-five divisional series at two games each. RECAP: @TeamCJCorrea crushes 2 homers, but #Astros fall to KC in Game 4 of #ALDS . http://t.co/HFY6xvIKlY pic.twitter.com/ici3Gu2KNg — Houston Astros (@astros) October 12, 2015 \nA spokesman for Abbott said the tweet from the office of the governor was sent as a result of a staff error and was not from Abbott's personal account. The tweet has since been deleted. \nThe Texas Rangers game started about the time the tweet was sent and the state's other Major League Baseball team quickly fell behind the Toronto Blue Jays in their playoff game. \nReaction among Texas baseball fans on social media was harsh. \n\"Thanks for the jinx there @GregAbbott_TX.
