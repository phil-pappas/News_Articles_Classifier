(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \nNAPA, Calif. (AP) — Brendan Steele did just enough to keep the lead Saturday at the Frys.com Open, even though he missed a chance to do more. \nAs one player after another was piling up birdies on the closing three-hole stretch at Silverado, Steele managed three pars for a 3-under 69 and a one-shot lead over Andrew Loupe and Kevin Na. \nLoupe had five straight birdies early and four straight birdies late for a 63 and was one shot behind. Na played the closing stretch in 3 under for a 64. \nThe PGA Tour season opener is wide open going into the final round. Sixteen players were separated by only four shots. \nSteele was at 14-under 202 as he tries to go wire-to-wire. \nRory McIlroy never got anything going and was eight shots behind.
