Tanner Marsh, Montreal’s third quarterback of the day, drove the Als down to the Argos’ 18 before time ran out. Toronto defensive back A.J. Jefferson broke up one pass into the end zone to keep the victory secure.\nThe Argo win, however, couldn’t disguise problems with Toronto’s kicking game. Justin Palardy missed two field goals, from 42 and 41 yards, and punter Antony Alix got pulled after punting the ball out of bounds in the air twice for penalties.\nAlix gave way to Dave Stala, who then gave way to Palardy.\nThe Argos, who won their third game in a row, now finish the season at home, starting with the Calgary Stampeders next Saturday.\nThe Argos scored on their first possession — also for the third straight game — but they were tied 10-10 in the fourth quarter when they got hot again.\nThey drove from their own 35 to the Montreal 27, where Trevor Harris hit Tori Gurley with a go-ahead touchdown pass. It was Gurley’s league-leading ninth receiving touchdown of the season.\nBrandon Whitaker, returning to Montreal for the first time as an Argo, scampered in from five yards for the final scoring points.\nHarris struggled for most of the game, and threw another interception, his league-leading 14th of the season.\nFor Montreal, Rakeem Cato was 9-of-12 for 72 yards before he left with an upper-body injury after the first half. He gave way to Duke product Anthony Boone, who threw a key interception in the third quarter to Toronto’s Akwasi Owusu-Ansah. He eventually gave way to Marsh.\nOwusu-Ansah, the Argo rookie defensive back, returned the interception 63 yards to set up the go-ahead fied goal as the Argos surged ahead 10-9 at the end of the third quarter. It was his third pick of the season.\nThe Argos opened the scoring on their first drive. Dionate Spencer used his speed to create separation, and Harris hit him in the end zone for a 20-yard touchdown strike. It was Spencer’s third touchdown of the season and Harris’s league-leading 30th TD pass of the season.\nThe four-play drive covered 70 yards and took only 1:41. The play was set up by a 36-yard catch by Gurley.\nIt looked like Toronto was on its way to a rout, but Montreal’s defence adjusted quickly, and the Argos showed how much they miss injured kicker Swayze Waters.\nIn the third quarter, Stala took over the punting duties from Alix, who had been called twice on penalties for kicking the ball out of bounds in the air. In five punts, Alix averaged only 32.2 yards.\nStala’s first punt travelled 26 yards. That led the way for Palardy to take over the punting as well as the field-goal kicking.\nMore on thestar.com\nHarold Reynolds apologizes to Canada for ‘can’t catch’ comments\nAdrian Beltre back in Rangers’ lineup", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:53:23.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
