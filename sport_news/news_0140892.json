The T-birds then pooched the next kickoff, recovered it, and scored with 17 seconds left to lead Kingman (1-8, 0-6) at the half, 27-7.\"It was a total debacle,\" said KHS football coach Greg Tonjes. \"I am proud of how we played, but we're just not an explosive offensive team that can go out there in a heartbeat and score quick points if we're going to give up points like that.\"Mohave had 364 yards in total offense in the 48-7 win. The T-birds rushed for 246 and passed for 118.\"We did a good job of stopping the run in the first couple of quarters,\" Tonjes said. \"It was the most physical defense we've played all season.\"The Bulldogs had 159 yards in total offense, led by Isiah Perez's 85 yards on 12 carries. Junior quarterback Nate Sinclair completed 4-of-14 passes for 19 yards. Sophomore Miguel Salinas took over in the fourth quarter and threw for 66 yards, connecting on 4-of-10 passes. Damon Heidorf caught four passes for 52 yards.Defensively, Heidorf led the Bulldogs with 14 tackles, caused a fumble, and blocked a kick. Julian Nelson and Whataname each added 10 tackles.\"The good news is that the younger guys got some playing time,\" the coach said. \"They responded and played with intensity. Even when the game got out of hand, they continued to play.\"Kingman wraps up the season with its Homecoming game against Wickenburg (4-5, 3-3) Friday. The Wranglers are another run-first offense and racked up 441 yards in its 42-26 win over Lee Williams two nights ago.\"We'll need to stop the run again,\" Tonjes said. \"We need to play excellent defense to keep the game close. We haven't done that for a whole game yet.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:17:06.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
