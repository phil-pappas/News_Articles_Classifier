Pic/AFP \nPique has been targeted by sections of the Spanish support since he mocked Real Madrid during Barcelona's treble-winning celebrations at the end of last season.\nArsenal playmaker Santi Cazorla and Valencia striker Paco Alcacer scored a brace each. The result saw Spain win the group outright after rivals Slovakia, who had been breathing down their necks, went down 1-0 at home to Belarus and drop to third.\nVicente del Bosque's men are five points clear of Slovakia and Ukraine, who won 2-0 at Macedonia. Despite Spain coach Vicente del Bosque and his teammates' pleas for the unjust treatment to stop, the former Manchester United man was roundly whistled at the start of the match before some began to applaud him as the match developed.\n\"The tendency is changing. The whistles are heard more loudly than the applause but it is getting better,\" he said. \"In no moment will they find that I have said something negative about this national team or this country.\"\nNot a Catalan issue \nHowever, he has previously stated he doesn't believe the Catalan issue is a reason for his treatment by the Spanish support as a host of other Catalan players in the squad have not been treated the same way.\n\"This is my home and my family. I have been coming here since the first day I was called-up and I have always been received warmly and treated well. They can't doubt me. The national team is part of me. I hope that this passes and they speak about football.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:33:27.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
