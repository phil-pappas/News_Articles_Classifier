They play real well positionally. Tonight we wanted the game to be easier than it really was and they play fast and just chip pucks in and make you work. \n“For portions of the game I think they outworked us.” \nGoalie Collin Delia stopped 21 of 22 shots faced for Merrimack. \nChristie scored the game’s first goal two minutes, 53 seconds into the second period and Seney followed with the eventual deciding goal at 16:02 of the period. \nThe Saints drew within 2-1 on freshman Michael Ederer’s first collegiate goal 7:56 into the third period, with Drew Smolcynski and Nolan Gluchowski assisting. \nBut the Warriors would build another two-goal lead on Chris LeBlanc’s tally with 2:15 left in regulation. \n“It wasn’t until we were down 2-0 that we realized how hard we had to work,” Carvel said. “We came back and had some chances. We had a power play and didn’t score and then we hurt ourselves with a couple of untimely penalties. \n“I give them a lot of credit, they were easily the best team we have seen.” \nKyle Hayton made 23 saves on 26 shots faced for St. Lawrence. Both teams went scoreless on the power play, with the Saints faring 0-for-4 and Merrimack 0-for-5.
