Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant hasn’t played in a game since suffering a foot injury in a Sept. 13 game and it appears he has filled some of that down time by getting acquainted with his new and unique pet.\nAdChoices Bryant, on the shelf now for weeks since he underwent a procedure to repair a fractured fifth metatarsal that included a bone graft and a screw being inserted into his right foot, introduced the world on Wednesday to his new, little pal: A monkey he has named, appropriately, “Dallas Bryant.” A nice name to be sure, but “Little Tony Romo” or “Jungle Jerry Jones” would have been nice options, too.\nMy new best friend.... Dallas Bryant world #throwupthex\nA photo posted by Dez Bryant (@dezbryant) on Oct 21, 2015 at 3:40pm PDT\nBryant dubs the teeny primate “my new best friend” in the Instragram post , and it’s hard to blame the wide receiver for so quickly developing an affinity for the little guy.\nWhile Bryant has begun to increase the intensity of his workouts as he continues rehab, reports still vary between Bryant giving it a go Sunday against the New York Giants and sitting out one more week ( although it appears he won’t play ). Either way, one thing is certain: Let’s hope Bryant has a babysitter lined up to keep an eye on little Dallas Bryant.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000562281/article/dez-bryant-foot-does-not-practice-for-cowboys", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2015/10/08/dez-bryant-doing-light-running-as-rehab-from-surgery-continues/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://instagram.com/p/9HeNhgt5Mx/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:10:22.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
