That leaves the second- and third-place teams in each subregion to contend for the No. 3 and No. 4 playoff spots.So, finishing fourth overall in the subregion won’t do the Yellow Jackets any good, which is why getting out of their current position is important.“If you’re not in the top three, then there is a sense of urgency for sure,” Sprayberry coach Billy Shackelford said. “You want to be 2 or 3 for a playoff spot and 1 to go for the championship. It’s real and it’s in-your-face for all of us, but every team in the region feels that pressure. We just need to worry about Sprayberry High School.”Inconsistent play has been the Achilles’ heel for the Yellow Jackets, who must stop beating themselves in order to snap out of their two-game skid.“If we don’t go out and give our best effort and instead play sporadically, it can lead to inconsistent play,” Shackelford said. “It starts at practice. If we can keep it simple from start to finish, that will lead to consistent play and an effort we can be proud.”Sprayberry will need to utilize more consistent play against a physical Forsyth Central team.“They’re a blue-collar team,” Shackelford said. “They’re physical and fill blocks and run right at you. We have to match their physicality, and make sure we don’t fall asleep and fall victim to their play-action.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:11:08.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
