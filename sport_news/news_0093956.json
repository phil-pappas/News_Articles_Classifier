The players weren’t taking Prince Avenue Christian offensive tackle Robert Kraeling to a house party or a fraternity event. \nThey were on the way to the nearest donut shop. \n“We just talked,” Kraeling said of his junior-year visit to Duke, where he ultimately committed to play. “I didn't realize until after that I had a full-on discussion with these guys. We were friends automatically, and knowing that there's people like that at Duke, it's exciting.” \nHeading into tonight’s game against undefeated Athens Academy, Prince Avenue, also undefeated at 6-0, has won every game by a margin of at least 20 points. The 6-foot-8 Kraeling is a factor in that productivity. \n“Rob has a huge upside. He’s a tall, rangy and athletic kid. He’s going to only continue to get better,” said Prince Avenue’s head coach Jeff Herron. \nKraeling is one of five Georgia high schoolers to verbally \ncommit to Duke’s 2016 recruiting class. Archer’s Dylan Singleton, Cherokee’s Brittain Brown, Sandy Creek’s Javon Jackson and Woodward Academy’s Antone Williams are the other four. All five are three-star recruits or higher. \nThis flood of Georgia boys to Duke is creating what recruiters are beginning to call a “Georgia Pipeline.” The key to winning over Kraeling, it turns out, wasn’t flashy facilities or football legacy. \n“For Rob, he feels like those guys are genuinely his friends,” Kim Kraeling, Robert’s mother, said of the Duke players. “They ask him about his life (through phone calls and text messages). For a 17- or 18-year-old, being asked things like, ‘Hey! How was the prom? Did y’all have a great time?’ it means a lot to him.” \nAccording to ESPN RecruitingNation, Duke’s 2016 class has more top recruits than the Blue Devils’ previous nine classes combined. Since 2010, Duke’s football team is 31-33. However, the Blue Devils have seen a spike in performance since 2013. In each of the last two seasons, Duke has finished with at least nine wins and played in a bowl game. \nKraeling began playing football in the fourth grade and has been one of the largest on the field ever since. Kraeling also plays center on the Prince Avenue varsity basketball team. Throughout his recruitment, his mom said, basketball was a way that coaches could see that he was not only a large player, but an agile and explosive player, which in football is hidden by his helmet. \nThe recruiting process started for Kraeling in his sophomore year. Auburn coaches visited during spring practice and from there word spread. It was not real to Kraeling until his first offer from a large school rolled in that fall from North Carolina State. Kraeling received more than 20 offers, including offers from Alabama, Auburn, Baylor, Georgia and Ole Miss. He found that top-notch facilities and electric atmospheres were the norm among Football Bowl Subdivision powerhouses. From this observation, Kraeling reassessed the way that he evaluated the colleges he visited. \n“My parents pushed me toward seeing even the bad stuff. As great as the program may be, you're going to go through hard times, you have to know who you can go to,” Kraeling said. \nHis mother describes Kraeling as someone who values a strong sense of community. Being the youngest child of three and having a large extended family, Kraeling is used to being surrounded by a strong support system. \n“I think that his school community will be important to help him finish maturing and growing as a man,” his mother said. “It's not just the football program itself. He is so relationship-focused, so when we were looking, we looked at relationships with the coaches, support staff, faculty, current players and really anybody we could plug him into to see what this life is like there.” \nWhile social media is now a prominent channel in the recruiting process, Kraeling represents how, even in a digital world, a personal touch in recruiting is important. Duke’s head coach David Cutcliffe and assistant coach Jeffrey Farris traveled to Bogart to sit down with Kraeling and gauge his interest in the football program. Kraeling said he felt intimidated by Cutcliffe’s presence initially. But the question Cutcliffe challenged Kraeling with changed the remainder of his recruiting process. \n“The first thing he said to me was, ‘Do you know what you want?’ And it stuck with me through the whole recruiting process,” Kraeling said. “I went through all of my visits and asked myself, ‘What do I want? What do I want to get out of this? What can I contribute to these people?’ At the time it was overwhelming, but in the end it helped me mold my decision.” \nAfter his final visit to Duke, Kraeling, who is interested in a business-related major, found that the players, coaches and support staff emulated exactly what he wanted from a school: community, academics, and purpose. \n“All those coaches are at Duke for some reason and I really think that they want to be a part of what Coach Cutcliffe has, which is to build something,” Kraeling said. “They want to be a part of something big and after taking a deep look, I realized that I want the same thing.” \nAinslie is a student in the Sports Media Certificate program at the University of Georgia’s Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:19:21.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
