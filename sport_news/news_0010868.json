He joked about a few questions. \nThere was nearly a grin. \nHis Alabama team had just survived another intense three hours, 37 minutes on a warm Texas afternoon. It got tight a few times, momentum was fleeting. Still, it found a new formula with familiar ingredients to pass this latest test. \nAlabama 41, Texas A&M 23 reinforced statements from the 38-10 win at Georgia while reversing a few themes from the 43-37 loss to Ole Miss. Like in Athens, Derrick Henry set a personal rushing mark (32 carries, 236 yards) and the Tide secondary exposed quarterbacking mistakes. Alabama scored 24 points off Aggie turnovers, the same number Ole Miss hung on the Tide off mistakes Sept. 19. \nThe number the matters most, though? Four. Alabama's 4-for-4 since losing to the Rebels, making each Saturday a playoff knock-out round. It's now 6-1 and will creep further into the top 10 in Sunday's polls. \n\"We haven't always played pretty as a team,\" a relatively relaxed Saban said Saturday night. \"But we compete well in games. We play with a lot of toughness.\" \nFrom here, Alabama has four SEC games left â€• the next two in Bryant-Denny Stadium. That Nov. 7 visit from LSU is separated by Saturday's rivalry game with Tennessee and a bye. \nBoth are huge. \nNeither would've meant quite as much without success against previously unbeaten Texas A&M. Nick Saban post-game press conference (Texas A&M) Nick Saban spoke to the media after his team's 42-23 victory over Texas A&M about Derrick Henry, the status of his center, and what his halftime message was to the team. \nThis was significant for a few other reasons. It was Alabama's third straight win over the No. 9 Aggies since Johnny Manziel's 2012 upset in Tuscaloosa. Questions about the secondary's handling of spread out, fast offenses were answered with four interceptions returned for a school-record three touchdowns. \n\"Don't doubt 'Bama, man,\" left tackle Cam Robinson said. \"Honestly, we've done so well in the past that if we lose one game everybody says oh something's wrong, is the dynasty over? No, we just lost a game. We will come out next week, move forward and continue to play Alabama football.\" \nIt's been here before. Last year's team won eight straight after falling at Ole Miss, so there's a blueprint to this. Gritty road wins like this tend to please Saban more than anything. \nOvercoming adverse conditions is even better and 105,733 in Kyle Field with that. The rebuilt coliseum stacks hostile voices closer to the field than before. Sidelines are tight, made mostly of a dark green, hard rubber surface. It didn't exactly absorb the warm October sun Alabama's sideline faced. There were cramping issues. Center Ryan Kelly left before halftime with concussion-like symptoms. \nAnd it wasn't always easy even after building leads of 21-3 and 28-6. A&M had the ball deep in Alabama territory in a one-possession game after a third-quarter blocked punt. The Alabama offense didn't even score after halftime as two Adam Griffith field goals and Minkah Fitzpatrick's second interception return sealed it. \n\"You have to respect the competitive character of this team,\" Saban said. \"My hat's off them. They did a fantastic job today. The coaches did a great job too.\" \nSo, what next? \nTennessee's disappointing early season turned a corner last week in an emotional win over Georgia. It also got this week off to prepare for the 2:30 p.m. Saturday trip to Bryant-Denny Stadium. Of course the biggest test is No. 6 LSU and Leonard Fournette. Then, road trips to Mississippi State and Auburn. \nLSU's the only ranked team left on Alabama's schedule, though nothing's a gimme without a safety net. Win out, and it's hard to imagine the Tide will miss the playoff. \nThey won't all be like the 28-point demoralization of Georgia. This was somewhere between that and last week's strange 27-14 win over Arkansas. Quarterback Jake Coker's fine with that. \n\"If we win, I don't care if it's ugly,\" he said after a mistake-free, 19-for-25 afternoon. \"I'll take it.\" \nAnd almost enough for a Saban smile.
