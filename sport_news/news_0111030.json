It was his second goal in the competition this season. \nSao Tome striker Luis Leal was the hero for Portuguese side Belenenses as they came from behind to beat Swiss hosts Basel 1-2. Leal scored his side's first goal to level the score in the 27th minute, before adding the assist for the second goal just before the break. \nCongo DR striker Cedric Bakambu scored twice in the first half for Spanish hosts Villarreal in a 4-0 thumping of Belarusians Dinamo Minsk. Cote d'Ivoire defender Eric Bailly capped the win in the 70th minute. \nRising Egypt striker Ahmed 'Koka' Hassan scored the opening goal for Portuguese side Sporting Braga as they edged French visitors Olympique Marseille 3-2. All goals were scored in the second half. \nMore from the Ivory Coast \nMeanwhile in the Champions League, Cote d'Ivoire stars lit up games for their clubs on Wednesday. \nIn England, Yaya Toure , starting alongside compatriot Wilfried Bony , inspired Manchester City to a dramatic 2:1 victory over Sevilla. The visiting Spaniards grabbed the lead in the 30th minute, but City were level six minutes after a miscued attempt by Bony was deflected in. \nOn a day City were largely average, former Arsenal and Manchester City striker, now football pundit, Niall Quinn, attributed the win to the dominance of Yaya (above, pictured). \nManchester City, the rest of them struggled, it was a nervy night and the fans didn't get going at all. How they've (won) is beyond me,\" Quinn said on Sky Sports . \nManchester City find themselves in the Champions League at this time, Yaya Toure can hurt teams. \n\"When he plays as cover for the defence you lose so much of what can happen at the other end. \n\"It was like watching a big, strong kid in the playground, running through players. He can't be as effective playing 40 yards out playing the ball out to the right-back or the left-back.\" \nOn Tuesday, flying winger Gervinho posted another impressive display for Italian side Roma as they drew 4-4 with German hosts Bayer Leverkusen. The former Lille and Arsenal star set up Roma\\'s fourth goal to make it 2-4 on 73 minutes before the Germans found two late goals. \n- \nFollow Gary on Twitter: @garyalsmith.
