Two weeks before the season started, second-year head coach Curtis Perkins resigned to spend more time with his wife and infant daughter in Williams, a 100-plus mile drive from Stockton, and to focus on his attendance at the police academy in Yuba City. So the Eagles, with dreams of San Joaquin Athletic Association championships and a Sac-Joaquin Section playoff bid, appeared to be in disarray. Yet, with Terry Hampton taking the reins, it’s been quite the opposite. Hampton, 38, was born and raised in Stockton, played football at Lincoln High, Delta College, Utah State and Fresno State, and now, is head coach of a varsity program for the first time. And the Eagles have thrived, going 5-1 overall and 1-0 in the SJAA thus far, with a defense that’s improved markedly since 2014. McNair allowed 27 points in a win over Tokay on Sept. 25 at the Tigers’ homecoming at the Grape Bowl, and six in a victory over Franklin last week. Hampton, who’s been a probation officer since 2003, has used his knack for disciplinarian methods to tighten up a defense that had lacked in recent years. “Football, like I always say, is just a platform that allows me the ability to give back,” said Hampton, who’s worked out of Stagg, Bear Creek, Edison and Franklin high schools. “I treat them like my own kids. I give them the respect they earn.” Hampton was an assistant with his alma mater, Lincoln, under coach Brian Gray, when the defensive coordinator spot opened up at McNair. Gray, who Hampton calls a lifelong friend, encouraged him to advance his career. Hampton also salutes other Lincoln coaches throughout the last few decades, including Jim Rubiales and Tom Galvin. Said Hampton: “I like to give thanks to the old-time coaches,\" who taught him life lessons. \"You know, as simple as take your hat off when you go in the house or go in the classroom. Shake hands. Say, 'thank you' to people.” Last spring, Hampton was convinced McNair was the place for him. Besides the fact that two of his cornerbacks were shot near the school, Hampton felt his presence as a probation officer and leader of young men would fit perfectly. “It was just the whole culture. I had shock and awe. We had not only players, but coaches, not coming to practice, and there was no accountability whatsoever,” Hampton said. “Players coming in late. Players not going to class.” Being clear about what’s expected, Hampton said, has been pivotal. As a result, McNair is close to having all of its football players academically eligible, he said. \"I think he just treats us all like his kids,\" said McNair senior linebacker Noah Faatau, the defending SJAA Defensive MVP. \"He just wants to win. We all want to win.” — Contact reporter Thomas Lawrence at (209) 546-8272 or tlawrence@recordnet.com.
