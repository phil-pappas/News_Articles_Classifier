Senior Malcolm Lambert rushed for 132 of his 187 yards in the first half and scored touchdowns on runs of 32 and 87 yards before halftime as Jacksonville opened its Coastal 3-A Conference schedule Wednesday night with a 44-20 victory over West Carteret. The game was scheduled for Friday, but moved three times before finally being played five days later because of the recent band of heavy rains. The Cardinals hadn’t played since a 34-12 win at Topsail on Sept. 18 – they were open the following week. The victory moved Jacksonville to 3-2 overall, although another win could be in store for the Cardinals if, as expected, the NCHSAA rules Northside has to forfeit its four victories because it used an ineligible player. Nonetheless, the Cardinals don’t have much time to celebrate the win over the Patriots, who fell to 0-7, 0-2 but also awaits word from the NCHSAA since West Carteret lost to Northside to open the season. Jacksonville visits Richlands on Friday while the Patriots travel to White Oak. “We will try to get ready and prepared for Richlands but try to get as much rest as we can,” Jacksonville coach Beau Williams said. “Only the coaching staff (prepared for Richlands), but they kind of do a lot of the similar things so it makes it a little easier. But we will find out Friday.” Williams and his staff made it a point when they could to take starters out on both sides of the ball in the second half because the Cardinals have the unusual task of playing two games in three days. Lambert, for example, only carried the ball four times in the second half after he had 11 carries in the first half. “Not to take anything away from West Carteret, but the last touchdown was on the second group and we have to get better there,” Williams said. “Once we got a big lead, we wanted to get those guys out and have them stay healthy for Friday.” The Cardinals built a 27-0 lead late in the second quarter. After West Carteret’s Luis Perez returned the opening kickoff 64 yards to the JHS 21-yard line, the Cardinals got a stop when defensive back Sean Ryan recovered a fumble at the 32. Jacksonville then marched 68 yards on six plays, capping the drive on Lambert’s 32-yard run to give the Cardinals a 7-0 lead. Late in the second quarter, Lambert darted 87 yards for a touchdown to make it 27-0 with 1:23 left until halftime. Lambert had success running up the middle as well as receiving option pitches from quarterback Jaicari Boone. Page 2 of 3 - “The offensive line really blocked good, and coach always tells me to hit my landmarks and don’t tip-toe through the line,” Lambert said. “I don’t think West Carteret was confused (by the option), but they weren’t going as hard as we were, and our quarterback, Jaicari, was leading the reads.” Jacksonville’s offense, however, got stagnant after its first touchdown as the Cardinals punted on their next three possessions. Things got better for JHS, though, when junior defensive lineman Kyle Lee went straight up the middle and blocked a punt and then beat the punter to the ball in the end zone for a touchdown to make it 14-0. “When I lined up, I just saw they snapped the ball and I knew if I got off the ball quick enough I would be able to block it,” Lee said. “Once I blocked it, I turned around to see where it was and he tried to beat me. I went straight to the ball.” Williams said his team came alive after the key special teams play. “Anytime you score on defense or special teams it’s huge,” he said. “It gives you a little bit of momentum and helps you win more.” Rashaud Whittington added a 25-yard touchdown run in the second quarter for the Cardinals before Lambert scored on his 87-yard run on JHS’ next possession. Still, winless West Carteret didn’t back down. The Patriots scored with 13.9 seconds left in the second quarter on quarterback Rodney Mitchell’s 1-yard run to within 27-7. Jacksonville received the second-half kickoff, but fumbled two plays into its possession with the Patriots recovering at the Cardinals’ 27. On the next play, Mitchell threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Daniel Fischler to cut Jacksonville’s lead to 27-13. But the Cardinals answered when Boone threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Chris Coleman. Boone scored on a 40-yard touchdown run on the next Jacksonville possession to extend the Cardinals’ lead to 41-13 with 1:02 remaining in the third quarter. Jacksonville averaged 10.3 yards per rush to 2.3 by West Carteret, which failed to score on two drives inside Cardinals’ territory in the first quarter while another one in the third quarter ended with an interception by Alex Pullen. “We had six illegal procedure penalties,” Williams said. “Once we knocked that out, we were able to do things.” Now the Cardinals turn their attention to Richlands (1-5, 0-1) less than 48 hours after defeating West Carteret. A daunting task certainly to play so soon, but a challenge the Cardinals accept, Lee said. “Yeah, it’s going to be different, but I know the whole summer every guy who showed up for workouts is prepared for it,” he said. “Our coaches know we are physically and mentally prepared. You can throw three games at us.” Page 3 of 3 - Jacksonville 7 20 14 3 — 44 West Carteret 0 7 6 7 — 20 First Quarter J – Lambert 32 run (Harrington kick) 8:16 Second Quarter J – Lee recovered blocked punt in end zone (Harrington kick) 10:33 J – Whittington 25 run (kick failed) 4:41 J – Lambert 87 run (Harrington kick) 1:23 W – Mitchell 1 run (Brooks kick) 0:13.9 Third Quarter W – Fischler27 pass from Mitchell (run failed) 11:40 J – Coleman 21 pass from Boone (Harrington kick) 8:14 J – Boone 40 run (Harrington kick) 1:02 Fourth Quarter W – Mitchell 3 run (Brooks kick) 7:08 J – FG Harrington 32, 4:01 J W", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:15:57.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
