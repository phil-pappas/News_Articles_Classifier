There's not much more I can say to be honest. I'm a bit speechless,\" he said afterwards. \n\n\"I have never been put down in my life, head shot or body shot. But sweet on the chin and I was down, but it's a testament to my fitness, you know,\" he said. \n\nConan, cheered on by a large number of Irish fans in the packed Ali Bin Hamad Al Attiyah Arena in the Qatari capital, also became a father for the first time this year and said he was \"desperate\" to get home to see his baby daughter. \n\nHe prepared for the fight by watching the Sylvester Stallone boxing classic, \"Rocky II\" on Tuesday and joked afterwards that he identified with the film's star, who says in the movie that winning a boxing title was the best day of his life after his baby being born. \n\nAlso on Wednesday, a new star of Cuban boxing was born when the baby-faced Joahnys Argilagos took gold, aged just 18. \n\nThe stylish teenager danced, bobbed and weaved his way to the title in the light-flyweight division (46-49kg), and, like Conlan, even overcame being knocked down in the final round. \n\nArgilagos said afterwards that he had \"prepared well\" for the tournament and wanted more medals. \n\n\"Now I am the world champion, I want to win gold in Rio,\" he said about next year's Olympics. \n\nArgilagos, nicknamed the \"small giant\", did just enough in the first two rounds to take the title, the first gold medal of the tournament. \n\nHe outsmarted Russia's Vasili Egorov and was cruising to the title before near disaster struck in the third, when he was floored by a right and received a count of eight. \n\nBut the judges decided the title was still his. \n\nIt was one of two gold medals Cuba took on Wednesday night with Arlen Lopez winning in the Middleweight (75kg) division. \n\nBut Erislandy Savon missed out at heavyweight (91kg), losing somewhat surprisingly to Russia's Evgeny Tishchenko. \n\nRussia also won gold at light-welterweight (64kg) with Vitaly Dunaytsev beating Uzbekistan's Fazliddin Gaibnazarov. \n\nThe remaining five finals will be fought on Thursday. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:54:14.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
