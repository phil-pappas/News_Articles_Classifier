Her quick judgement and ability to properly asses her opponent's defensive lineup help keep her team on track during games. \n\"Without a good setter, you don't have a team. Your setter controls the game, she has to get to the pass. . . then she has to decide the best person to set to based on what's on the other side,\" coach Barbara McBrearty said. \"She makes the decisions of whose going to do the hitting.\" \nBevenour's aggression and fierce determination on the court have allowed her to achieve her goals and stand out as a player. \n\"Kyra sets her goal extremely high, she's very competitive, and she will do anything she can to get to the ball,\" McBrearty said. \"It's an honor for her and she deserves it.\" \nThe Minutemen have a record of 6-8 through Tuesday and hope to capture two more wins in order to qualify for the playoffs. \nRegardless of how their season plays out, Bevenour has no plans on stopping her aggression now that she's got 500 under her belt. \n\"I am trying to get 1,000 by my senior year,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:34:28.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
