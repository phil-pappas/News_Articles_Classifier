It was 42-0 at the break , and the Tigers scored three touchdowns in each of the first two quarters. \nThe Hurricanes entered Saturday’s game with a 4-2 record but facing continued fan impatience over its extended rebuild under Coach Al Golden , now in his fifth season. But now, down 6 TDs at halftime to a team in your conference in your own barn, Golden might want to update his LinkedIn page. \nOh yeah, and people are fighting in the stands. #Miami fans scuffling in the stands. Lots of people being ejected. #Clemson up 28-0. pic.twitter.com/vcj0SMuNp3 \n— Sefton Ipock (@SeftonIpock) October 24, 2015 OK, Clemson staying on the field at halftime and eating orange slices up 42-0 is the new low for Miami. My goodness. \n— Paul Myerberg (@PaulMyerberg) October 24, 2015 #6 Clemson is absolutely dominating Miami leading 42-0 at half. The Tigers out rushed the Canes 230 to 24. #CLEMvsMIA https://t.co/xj0uGQIWXd \n— ESPN CollegeFootball (@ESPNCFB) October 24, 2015 Clinton Yates is a D.C. native and an online columnist.
