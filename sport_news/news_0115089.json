They never quit. We went up 10, 14 and they just kept coming. It was a lot like playing against our defense. I just can't say enough of how hard they played and how hard they fought.\" \nAfter scoring on its first drive, Rice recovered an Army fumble on its first play of the game. This snapped a 174-snap streak with no turnovers created by the Owls defense. The fumble recovery is the first turnover for the Rice defense since recovering a fumble against Baylor. \nThe running attack for Rice was paced by Darik Dillard, who was one of six Owls to get carries, finishing with 10 carries for 89 yards and a score. \nWith his 34-yard touchdown run with 13:38 left in the first quarter Dillard marked his 21st of his career, adding that to his brother Jarett's 60, who was at Rice from 2005-2008, tied the NCAA record for touchdowns by siblings. The 81 career touchdowns tied the record set by Jacquizz and James Rodgers of Oregon State. \nIn the opening 2:23 of the game, Rice pounded the ball in twice, Dillard running it in, then after a fumble by Army on its own 23, the Owls' punched it in from a yard out by Samuel Stewart. \nAfter those scores, Rice was held scoreless for 24:04 until Luke Turner took the ball into the end zone from two yards out with 3:43 left in the half. \nIn the meantime Army, which ranks 12th in FBS in rushing averaging 258.7 yards per game, took to what they knew best. The Black Knights mounted a comeback in the game finishing racking up 378 yards by the end. \nBlack Knight's quarterback A.J. Schurr finishing with 23 carries for 117 yards and a touchdown, while Aaron Kemper had 14 carries for 129 yards. \nThis is the first time Army has had two players break the 100-yard rushing mark since Angel Santiago and Larry Dixon rushed for 120 and 107 yards, respectively against Morgan State on August 30, 2013. \nSchurr's 100-yard rushing day at quarterback marks the first time an Army quarterback has done that since Ahmad Bradshaw rushed for 129 yards against UConn earlier this season. Schurr came close against Bucknell on Oct. 17 rushing for 99 in that win. \nArmy will now prepare to face Air Force on Nov. 7 in the 50th all-time meeting between the two service academies. \n\"I hate to have to live with a loss for two weeks. It's agonizing,\" Monken said. \"The next game is such a big a game. We're in the hunt for the Commander & Chief Trophy and this is the first step toward that. We have a few guys injured, so having the extra time I hope is a benefit to us.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:40:00.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
