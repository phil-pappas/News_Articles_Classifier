I had to do a lot of machine work, about six hours a day. \n\"Sleeping in a leg brace isn't good. At night it's not comfortable, it's the first time I've slept on my back in years. \n\"It's good to finally be out of the brace now and walking. It feels like I'm getting that little bit closer to getting back out on the pitch.\" \nShould Welbeck be fit and available, the chances are he will be included in Roy Hodgson's England squad for France 2016 having scored six goals in the five qualification games he featured in. \nBut for now Welbeck is instead focusing on getting back to playing for Arsenal before he starts contemplating another major international competition. \n\"I am not looking ahead to the Euros at the moment,\" he added. \n\"I need to get back for Arsenal first, then see what happens. It is never good to get injured at any point. It is frustrating. \n\"I missed the back end of last season, then came back into pre-season training and you go through it all again with the rehab. It is frustrating. \n\"But it is something which is part and parcel of the game. It is something I have to deal with.\" \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
