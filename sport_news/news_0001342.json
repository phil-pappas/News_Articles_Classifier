Sure, her absence from the athletic arena was difficult and the rehabilitation challenging. Doyle, who turned 17 on Sept. 22, said she was upset being away but that she recovered quickly and that she tried not to get down about the injury. “It was tough,” she said, “but it wasn’t the toughest thing that has happened.” The toughest thing Doyle and her family have had to deal with over the years was the diagnosis that her mother, Meghan, had breast cancer and the treatment that followed that ultimately made her a survivor of the deadly disease. Meghan, 42, beat cancer about eight years ago following a double mastectomy, six rounds of chemotherapy, and a rash of fatigue that she said “lasted for years” and that would often make it difficult for her to attend Kerry’s sporting events. Given all this, Kerry, who sports a 5.04 grade point average, is appreciative of her opportunity to play sports. “I know not to take anything for granted and that you have to give it your all,” Kerry said. “I have bad games, but you have to give it your all at all times because you never know if it will be your last game.” Such a mature attitude comes from the reality that Kerry had to grow up quickly. It started with the news that her mom had breast cancer and continued with her not only having to take care of her herself but also her mother. “I came home and my husband and I sat her down and told her and what she said to me was, ‘I’m going to go to my room and cry for a while and when I’m done, I’m done,’” Meghan said. “She went upstairs, and she had a cry I had never heard, but when she was done, she was done. We agreed as a family that we weren’t getting down in the dumps about it.” And Kerry didn’t. There were plenty of times Kerry helped get things such a drink for her mom, who was too fatigued to get up. And then there were other times when Kerry spent nights with her mom watching movies, particularly “80’s movies and chick flicks,” Kerry said. “I feel like I’m an adult right now,” Kerry said with a chuckle. Page 2 of 3 - Well, not so fast, momma Doyle quickly added. “That’s incorrect,” she said with a laugh. “But Kerry definitely had to grow up fast. That was a difficult time for her.” Meghan was diagnosed with a “very aggressive” cancer Oct. 29, 2006, at the age of 33. She said it was a type of cancer that predominately affects African-American women and that if it’s too advanced before caught, it can be fatal. Meghan’s first thought was of Kerry, her only child who was 9 at the time. “My mother actually grew up without her mom. Her mom died of colon cancer when she was in her 40’s and I didn’t want my daughter to grow up without her mom,” Meghan said. “So that really was my primary concern.” Then came the treatment, first with surgery in November of that year. Then came the chemotherapy before another surgery in June 2007. But even then with the cancer removed, the struggles continued for Meghan, who now works as an assistant county manager for Onslow County following a tenure in the county school system as a teacher, principal and assistant superintendent. “Kerry was playing soccer at the time and I would go to every practice and every game. I’m a stalker mom, but during that time I could not do that,” Meghan said. “I didn’t miss a day of work. I was a principal at the time, but as soon as I got to the house after work, I was so tired. It was everything I could to get up to go to a soccer game or go anything to support her. This lasted years.” And while Kerry said she “didn’t realize the magnitude of how serious” her mom’s condition was back then, she wanted to help her mother. “My dad was upset about it. He wasn’t his normal corky self and my mom was tired all the time,” Kerry said. “So I tried to help as much as I could. We watched movies a lot together. I wanted to spend time with her. Mom and I really got closer that time and we are still close now. She’s my mom, but she is still one of my best friends.” Meghan started feeling better once she took up running in 2011, although she still sees the doctor periodically just to be safe. She not only continues running but is joined by Kerry along with friends. They find it a way to keep themselves healthy. “She wins all of the time,” Kerry said with a smile. “It’s fun to hang out and we all run together and push each other.” Page 3 of 3 - When Kerry isn’t running recreationally with her mother and friends, she’s running or playing soccer for White Oak. And there Meghan is watching it all happen. Kerry has played soccer since she was 4 and started doing track and cross country when she entered high school. Soccer, though, is No. 1. “I feel like when I’m playing defense in soccer that I’m in control and that I see the field very well,” Kerry said. “I like to talk when I’m back on defense.” And Meghan enjoys every minute of watching Kerry play in the Vikings’ backline as a defender. “Before I got sick, it (sports) was for her to participate in team sports and learn all the lessons and character building you get from that,” Meghan said. “It’s the same thing now, plus it’s wanting her to be fit, and not fit in you having a certain body type but because these things are cancer fighters. Kerry, unfortunately, has genes coming down from both sides of her family, specifically for breast cancer, so I want her to take care of herself and learn those habits early in life.” When her high schools days are done, Kerry wants to attend the University of North Carolina and major in biology and go into physical therapy. Meghan has high expectations of her daughter. “I want to see her finish strong,” Meghan said. “A lot of seniors in high school take early release and finish early and then take six months off, go to college and end up struggling as a result. I want her to finish strong and challenge herself this year because college isn’t going to be any easier. But I can’t say enough how proud I am of her. She’s really busted her tail.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:31:11.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
