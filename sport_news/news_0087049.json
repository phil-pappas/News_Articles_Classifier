Full-back Taijo Teniste went on a mazy 60-yard run and was inches away from playing in Ats Purje before captain Ragnar Klavan tried to test Joe Hart from 30 yards but his shot ballooned off target. \nBarkley's quickfire charges through midfield were a great source of forward momentum for the hosts and he had another long range effort deflected wide on 41 minutes. \nHe would find a killer ball five minutes later though as England opened the scoring. \nThe lively Walcott drifted in off his right wing and was found with a well-timed pass from Barkley inside the six yard box. The Arsenal striker is a man in form, having scored six goals in his last eight games, and he tucked the chance away with consummate ease from close range. \nOne striker that isn't quite in that goalscoring zone currently is Kane and he cut a frustrated figure in the lone striker role for most of the evening. Chances came his way early in the second half but he mistimed a volley from the right when well placed and then took one too many touches from close range after Lallana's shot was parried away. \nBarkley was the next England player to go close on 76 minutes but his quest for a second international goal bore no fruit as he was denied by a spectacular Aksalu save after some neat footwork on the edge of the area. \nThe second goal would eventually come with five minutes remaining. Substitute Jamie Vardy burst down the left flank and rolled the ball across the goal for Sterling to turn home from close range. \nHodgson's men now face a final group game on Tuesday night against Lithuania in a bid to make it a perfect 10 in qualification.
