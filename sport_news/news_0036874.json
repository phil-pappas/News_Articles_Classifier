Ten months after a hazing scandal in Sayreville, N.J. rocked a community and put its powerhouse football program in the crosshairs of a media firestorm, two of the teenagers involved in the case were found not guilty of the most serious charges, according to published reports.\nThe ruling was made last week by a Family Court judge in a closed proceeding, because all seven of the students charged in the case were juveniles.\n SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nThe high-profile case, brought by the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office, alleged that four freshmen players were groped and violated in ritualized locker-room rites, resulting in the cancellation of the balance of the 2014 season for the Sayreville War Memorial HS team, and the ouster of its longtime coach, George Najjar, who had built the program into a regional power.\nTwo of the seven students charged in the scandal were cleared of aggravated sexual contact and aggravated assault charges, said Richard P. Klein, an attorney for one of the youths, according to NJ.com.\n“This is a good kid, who never should have been treated like this,” Klein told the website. “It was an overzealous prosecutor, putting forward this case. As far as we’re concerned, the prosecutor’s office acted reprehensibly.”\nA spokesman for the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe story broke early last October, amid reports that seven varsity players had brutally hazed four younger boys in an unsupervised locker room, prompting Sayreville superintendent Richard Labbe to cancel the remainder of the season − an action that made him an anti-bullying hero to some, and an over-reacting grandstander to others, among them hundreds of former Sayreville players who stood staunchly behind Najjar.\nThe disposition of the case involving the other five students charged in the case was not clear.\nSean McIntosh, a senior on last year’s team who will be studying Criminal Justice and playing football for King’s College in Pennsylvania this fall, has maintained from the start that nothing remotely criminal occurred and that the superintendent and school board had acted recklessly in scrapping the season and robbing graduating players of their senior season.\n“I just feel like (those charged) were done wrong and handled completely wrong through the whole process,” McIntosh said Monday.\nRelated Stories Sayreville defendants won't be charged as adults Sayreville lets ex-football coach Najjar keep teaching job Sayreville students wear T-shirt to support fired Najjar Sayreville football will play in '15 after hazing scandal Tags: sayreville high school", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:01:58.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
