We both will amicably withdraw the case. We were friends. We fought, and continue to remain friends here after,\" she said. \nAmit Mishra \nMishra was in Bengaluru last month for India's pre-tour training camp when he had met the woman. \nThe police had asked Mishra to appear before them in a week's time. Mishra was booked under the Indian Penal Code sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 328 (causing hurt with intent to commit an offence). \nShe clarified that that she has not taken the step under pressure. \n\"There was no pressure from any quarters, including the BCCI. I am surprised how the media picked up the case, which I have decided to withdraw,\" she said.
