Southern Lehigh, which will be the No. 2 seed for the tournament, still will have to get past a good Pen Argyl team in the first round. The Green Knights locked up the third seed on Thursday with a 3-1 win over Saucon Valley. \nUnbeaten and top-ranked Moravian Academy will play No. 4 Bangor in the other league semifinal. \nSouthern Lehigh capped another outstanding regular season on Wednesday with a hard-fought 1-0 win over improved Catasauqua. \nRELATED : Southern Lehigh field hockey team finds enough resources to get the job done \nThe Spartans and Moravian Academy have had a number of epic battles in recent years with most of the games being decided by one goal. Moravian defeated Southern Lehigh for the 2014 Colonial League title before the Spartans got revenge by defeating the Lions in the District 11 Class AA title game. \nThere may be a tendency for some Southern Lehigh players to look past Pen Argyl with Moravian on the horizon. Moravian dealt the Spartans their only loss of the season, 3-1, on Sept. 18. \nHowever, Southern Lehigh coach Adrienne Searfoss is confident her team will have the right frame of mind. \nPen Argyl gave the Spartans a tough battle in the regular season meeting on Sept. 23. The game was scoreless at halftime before the Spartans took charge in the final 30 minutes to post a 3-0 win. \n“We have to take care of business,” Searfoss said. “Fran (Pen Argyl coach Fran Rowley) always does a nice job with the girls. It’s always a tough battle. Our girls know what needs to be done. We have to take one game at a time. It’s survive and advance.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:51:11.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
