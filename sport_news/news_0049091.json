Photo: Getty Images WTA CEO admits ‘fundamental changes’ needed in Tour calendar Published: 12:41 AM, October 27, 2015 Updated: 1:23 AM, October 27, 2015 (Page 1 of 2) - NEXT PAGE | SINGLE PAGE \nSINGAPORE — Too hard, too fast, too often. That is how tennis legend Martina Navratilova sums up the cause of the injury woes that have hit the women’s tour, and particularly the season-ending BNP Paribas WTA Finals Singapore, this season. \nAlready hit by the withdrawal of world No 1 and defending champion Serena Williams, the ongoing US$7 million (S$9.74 million) tournament has also seen a host of singles and doubles players afflicted by or recovering from various injuries and ailments. \nNavratilova, an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion, attributed the swelling injury list to the increasing physical demands of the sport, the competitiveness on the WTA Tour, and a packed 11-month season. Adding on exhibition matches like the International Premier Tennis League in the off-season also means players get less rest and recovery. \n“They’re playing with nylon and leather rackets now on hard courts that are much harder on the body and less forgiving,” the 59-year-old told TODAY. “The nylon strings also (make them) hit the ball harder, so it has so much more impact on the joints and muscles. So it is almost impossible to stay as healthy as we used to be. \n“The way the ranking works, it is really cumulative ... it is based on quality, but more of quantity. Players feel like, by not playing, they’re losing out. They end up playing slightly injured, or playing themselves into being hurt, because they play more tournaments than they should.” \nWilliams’ coach Patrick Mouratoglou concurred: “The tournament (season) is long, the bodies are tired, so there are a lot of troubles. The fact is, the surfaces are slower, so there are many more rallies, and the rallies are longer. You don’t have easy points, and now you have to work a point every time. So now, it is tougher on the body than it used to be.” \nWhile players like world No 6 Agnieszka Radwanska have called for a shorter season — the Tour consists of 55 events in 33 countries — the WTA had previously said that it would not be changed. However, newly appointed chief executive officer Steve Simon believes the organisation needs to “make some fundamental changes in the calendar and our approach to it”. \nThe crunch in schedule after September’s US Open, which includes four premier and five international WTA events in Asia and Europe, will also need to be addressed, said Simon. \n“We have to look at our structure and look at what we do to give the athlete the best chance to be as close to 100 per cent at the end of the year as they can,” he said in a press conference yesterday (Oct 26). “That’s our responsibility. If I can’t have them on the court, I don’t have the premium product that I am looking to deliver. It’s a fundamental challenge we have to work with.” \nThe new WTA chief also intends to get feedback from some of the Tour’s athletes. “The players are tired coming out of the US Open. Then you exacerbate it when you have a compelling race that’s forcing them to play even more to try and get here,” he added.
