Aghast at the report, Siril's parents took him to AIIMS, the country's premier hospital, on Tuesday. \n\nDr. Smriti Hari, additional professor of Department of Radiology at AIIMS, certified that Siril's age was estimated to be between 16-18 years. It is learnt that the doctors at AIIMS were surprised at the 'overage' report. \n\nLike others, Siril's parents too had cried foul before they took their son to AIIMS. They alleged that it was a conspiracy to prevent Siril from participating in the tournament. Siril was the top seed and favourite to win a medal at the Asian meet. \n\nSimilar were the cases of Kalpita Sawant and Bhavya Rishi. Statistical records suggest that their birth certificates are genuine as they showed the periods of their mothers' pregnancy and the dates of delivery. \n\nAccording to Nilesh Prabhu, a key member of the parents' body which exposed several age fraud incidents through RTI, Sawant's and Bhavya's age cannot be wrong as both have clear statistical records. \n\n\"When the dates of mother's pregnancy are recorded with a reputed hospital how can the age be wrong? There is a big scam here because the real cheats were cleared,\" said Prabhu.
