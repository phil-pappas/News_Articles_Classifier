After suffering a shambolic defeat against Olympiakos last month, Arsenal responded in emphatic style by claiming victories over Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Watford. Wenger's men can top the Premier League if they beat Everton tonight. Wenger said that Ozil was focused on his job and that he was a very collective player who sacrifices himself for the team, the Guardian reported. The manager also said that the German plays a vital link between the low midfield and the striker, and insisted that his side have become mature and defensively stable. Earlier in the week, Arsenal shrugged off signs of fallibility with a 2-0 win over Bayern, reviving their hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League .
