That's a subjective call, of course. But there is a way to measure this too. \nThe Mets rookie pitcher set a record of sorts when he completed his 2015 regular season Saturday. He will go down with the highest average fastball velocity of any starting pitcher, minimum 100 innings pitched, in any season since Fangraphs began tracking it in 2002. \nSyndergaard averaged 97.1 mph this season. Which is really just kind of astounding. According to Brooks Baseball, Syndergaard averaged 97.7 mph with his four-seam fastball Saturday while striking out 10 in seven innings against the Nationals in the Mets 3-1 loss. \nAgain, wow. RELATED: Projecting the Mets playoff roster vs. Los Angeles Dodgers: All 25 of them \nThis stat also happened to bring some glee to Mets fans, who thought it was evidence against Michael Kay, the YES and ESPN 1050 AM broadcaster, who said the Mets wouldn't benefit from the shadows in Los Angeles the same way the Dodgers would because they didn't have the power pitchers to match. \nWhich is kind of an odd thing to say on its face. Mainly because it makes very little logical sense. Or has any factual consistency. But whatever. \nThe way the Mets fans reacted to it, however, then forced Kay to break out into an angry rant. He said he hoped Mets would \"choke on their own bile.\" \nThat kind of took things to another, weirder place. \nThere's no normal way to respond to Kay's comments but at least there are facts to prove him wrong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T15:44:42.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
