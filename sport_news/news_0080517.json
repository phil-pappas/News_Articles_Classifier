As a freshman he played in every game and the following year he started them all. We caught up with the Sioux Falls native after his team's win at Minnesota. \nNate Gerry entered his junior year on the Preseason All-Big Ten list and was voted a team captain by his Nebraska teammates. Thus far he leads the Blackshirt defense in interceptions and is second on the team in tackles. However despite his individual success Nebraska is just 3-4 with their losses coming by a combined 11 points, but as any good leader he remains positive. \n\"That's one thing that I am really proud of this team. We have overcome a lot of things and no matter the number wins or losses; I think this team is going to be family no matter what. As a captain it makes me really proud of the family culture we have here,\" Gerry said. \nGerry was part of a family culture at Washington as well. In his four years the Warriors won three state titles propelling Gerry to be one of the most sought after athletes in the country. Three years later he still has a championship mindset. \n\"I want to win championships,\" Gerry exclaimed. \"That is one thing that I told Coach Pelini and his staff when I committed here. I told them that I wanted to come here to play football and win championships, because when I was at Sioux Falls Washington all we did was win championships. That is one thing I want to do at the collegiate level, win championships,\" he added. \nTitles or not, Gerry's personal success is gaining national attention. The 6-2 safety is on the Lott Impact Trophy watch list, an award that goes to the nation's top defensive player both on and off the field. Although he has one year left in Lincoln he says he wants to play at the next level and be a role model for future South Dakota athletes. \n\"I just want to be somebody people back home can look up to. To play in the NFL would be cool, but I have a couple years here left and I want to get my education to make my momma proud. One thing I'm really looking forward to when I leave here is the family culture Nebraska has provided for me,\" Gerry said. \nGerry and the Huskers will return home this weekend to host Northwestern. Kickoff is set for 11 a.m. in Lincoln.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:05:31.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
