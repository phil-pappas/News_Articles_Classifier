We played as well as we can today,” Japan coach Eddie Jones said. \n“It has been fantastic. The guys have all played above themselves and worked hard and with a real spirit and how rugby should be played.” \nFollowing the advent of five-team groups in 2003, no team had won three of their four pool stage encounters and not progressed to the next round. \nYet Japan’s failure to pick up bonus points in any of their matches and their tired defeat to Scotland four days after their Springbok shock proved to be their undoing and ensured there was nothing but pride to play for at the Kingsholm Stadium. \nThat and another opportunity to show off their well-honed technical skills and remind everyone how far they have progressed having won only one game in all their previous World Cup campaigns. \nAfter AJ MacGinty landed an early penalty for the US, Japan responded with their first foray into American territory, switching the ball from one flank to other with swift hands to leave Matsushima free to cross in the corner. \nThe US hit back with Ngwenya touching down, after a raking pass from Wyles, for his first World Cup try in eight years. \nThe Japanese again took swift retribution, however, as Yoshikazu Fujita sneaked through a heaving mass of bodies to score and an Ayumu Goromaru penalty gave the Japanese a comfortable 17-8 lead at the break. \nThe sides exchanged penalties at the start of the second half, but a yellow card for US prop Eric Fry proved a debilitating blow as Japan extended their advantage within a minute, with Mafi driving over the line from close range for a third try. \nThe US did not lie down and MacGinty launched a superb long pass out to the right flank for fullback Chris Wyles to touch down. \nMacGinty’s conversion briefly reduced the deficit to seven points before another Goromaru penalty rounded off the scoring. \nThe Gloucester fans gave Japan a rousing send-off and they can now build for their 2019 tournament with the sport on a high in their own country. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:57:43.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
