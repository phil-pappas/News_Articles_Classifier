Cole Beasley sucks.\n— Jason Rieker (@JRieker300) October 25, 2015 @Bease11 pack your bags get off the team\n— Mets/Cowboys Nation (@im__JC) October 25, 2015 @Bease11 Not one single Cowboys fans like you anymore\n— Mets/Cowboys Nation (@im__JC) October 25, 2015 There were also several vulgar tweets that were directed straight at Beasley.\nThose insults didn't sit well with Beasley's wife, Kyrstin, who jumped on Twitter to defend her husband.\nIn a series of tweets, Krystin lashed out at the fans, using f-bombs and several other words we can't use here. You can see the censored tweets below (via the Dallas Morning News ).\nBeasley's wife later apologized for the tweets and said that she was set off when someone sent a tweet attacking her son (apology via @Dhambrick63 on Twitter ).\nCowboys cornerback Tyler Patmon later weighed in with what was probably the most sensible take: Don't go after someone's family.\nIf you're a fan know your boundaries. No fan has the right to go after a mans family or wife! You wouldn't want some one disrespecting yours\n— Tyler Patmon (@Lion_hearted_26) October 26, 2015 As for Beasley, although he wasn't solely responsible for the loss, he did later apologize . \nI apologize to all the fans. I must be better. Thanks for all the support from the true fans. You know who you are. #cowboysnation \n— Cole Beasley (@Bease11) October 26, 2015 Besides the fumbled punt, Beasley didn't really get in on the action against New York. The Cowboys receiver had zero catches against the Giants and was only targeted twice by Cassel. \n\nSunday wasn't a great day for Cole Beasley.
