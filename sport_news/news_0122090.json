They will be provided by Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, Surgeon-in-Chief, and Dr. Nia Smyrniotis, Medical Director. The seminars will be held on Thursday, October 29, 2015, at 11:00 am at the Embassy Suites PGA Boulevard – Palm Beach Gardens, 4350 PGA Boulevard, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33401. Please RSVP at (561) 331-2999, this event is by reservation only.\nThe Miami Stem Cell Treatment Center (Boca Raton and Miami, Florida), along with sister affiliates, the Irvine Stem Cell Treatment Center (Irvine, California) and the Manhattan Regenerative Medicine Medical Group (Manhattan, New York), abide by approved investigational protocols using adult adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) which can be deployed to improve patients’ quality of life for a number of chronic, degenerative and inflammatory conditions and diseases. ADSCs are taken from the patient’s own adipose (fat) tissue (found within a cellular mixture called stromal vascular fraction (SVF)). ADSCs are exceptionally abundant in adipose tissue. The adipose tissue is obtained from the patient during a 15 minute mini-liposuction performed under local anesthesia in the doctor’s office. SVF is a protein-rich solution containing mononuclear cell lines (predominantly adult autologous mesenchymal stem cells), macrophage cells, endothelial cells, red blood cells, and important Growth Factors that facilitate the stem cell process and promote their activity.\nADSCs are the body’s natural healing cells - they are recruited by chemical signals emitted by damaged tissues to repair and regenerate the body’s injured cells. The Miami Stem Cell Treatment Center only uses Adult Autologous Stem Cells from a person’s own fat – No embryonic stem cells are used; and No bone marrow stem cells are used. Current areas of study include: Emphysema, COPD, Asthma, Heart Failure, Heart Attack, Parkinson’s Disease, Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Crohn’s Disease, Muscular Dystrophy, Inflammatory Myopathies, and degenerative orthopedic joint conditions (Knee, Shoulder, Hip, Spine). For more information, or if someone thinks they may be a candidate for one of the adult stem cell protocols offered by the Miami Stem Cell Treatment Center, they may contact Dr. Gionis or Dr. Smyrniotis directly at (561) 331-2999, or see a complete list of the Center’s study areas at: MiamiStemCellsUSA.com.\nAbout the Miami Stem Cell Treatment Center: The Miami Stem Cell Treatment Center has offices in Boca Raton and Miami, Florida. We provide care for people suffering from diseases that may be alleviated by access to adult stem cell based regenerative treatment. We utilize a fat transfer surgical technology to isolate and implant the patient’s own stem cells from a small quantity of fat harvested by a mini-liposuction on the same day. The investigational protocols utilized by the Miami Stem Cell Treatment Center have been reviewed and approved by an IRB (Institutional Review Board) which is registered with the U.S. Department of Health, Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP).
