It then presents that information visually and in real time on computer screens and a huge wall-sized dashboard so commanders can dispatch resources immediately.\nSPD announces Agile Policing strategy, unveils Real-Time Crime Center: http://t.co/vtNLMkNdyo\n— Seattle Police Dept. (@SeattlePD) October 7, 2015 The incidents are color-coded: red represents highest priority, green for priority two, and yellow for priority three.\nSPD analyst Brendan Bouier, who helped design the system, confirmed the simplicity of the color codes will help speed officer response times.\n\"At the end of the day, the point of any sort of analysis is to turn raw data into useful information,\" he said. \"The point of the dashboard is to allow a person at a glance and quickly be able to interpret and act on that information.\"\nThe Real Time Crime Center opened about a year after the department introduced SeaStat , a system that uses technology to gather and analyze crime data.\nMayor Ed Murray said since SeaStat's debut, overall crime citywide is down 13 percent.\nThe hope is that the Real Time Crime Center will keep crime trending downward.\n\"This will be the hub of our agile policing strategy,\" O'Toole said.\ncomment (5)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://t.co/vtNLMkNdyo", "https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/651827966515613696"], "published": "2015-10-07T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:15:06.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
