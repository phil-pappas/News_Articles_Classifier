TCU entered the night third nationally in scoring at 51.3 points per game. ISU didn’t score in the final 46 minutes, 49 seconds of the game and had just 199 yards of total offense in the final three quarters. \n“(TCU) had line movement that was different that started hitting us in some spots,” Rhoads said. “They started bringing more pressure, more pressure off the edge. Overall, not just five guys, but six guys against the run game and pass game vs. down and distance situations. \n“They are a well defensive coached football team and getting some people back and starting to come into their own as far as that is concerned.” \nISU quarterback Sam Richardson threw for 111 yards on 6 of 9 passing in that first frame, but went just 16 of 27 for 140 yards the rest of the way. The running game managed just 59 yards in the final 45 minutes after having 56 in the first 15. \n“They knew on first and second down, we were trying to establish the run game early,” Richardson said, “so they were blitzing those packages pretty quickly in the second half.” \nThe Cyclones didn’t do themselves any favors with two lost fumbles, one coming on the TCU 10-yard line in a 21-all game in the second quarter when Richardson’s pitch to Mike Warren went astray. \n“Very costly play,” Rhoads said. “You are down in your red zone. It was a good (audible by Richardson) based on what we had called and what they showed. \n“It was a good check to go to the option play, but you put the ball on the ground when you have an opportunity to get seven points. It’s crucial.” \nISU also went 3 of 12 on third down for the game, including 2 of 9 in the final three quarters. \n“We left a couple plays out on the field,” wide receiver Quenton Bundrage said. “It’s very frustrating because I personally felt like we could have won this game. We sort of kind of let it slip out of our hands. \n“They’re the No. 3 ranked team in the nation so they’re a great team. We just lost. Simple as that.” \nThe stall-out against the Frogs wasn’t an isolated case for ISU of an offense that putters to the finish line as the Cyclones have been hurt at times with an attack that isn’t sustained for four quarters. \n“We can definitely finish games a lot better than what we do, obviously,”Bundrage said. “If we finish games it would change the whole outlook of the season.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:55:22.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
