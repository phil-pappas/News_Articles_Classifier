He shot 2-over (73-70-75) for the tournament. The only player to not finish over par in the event was Memphis' Thomas Perrott, who won the event at even-par. \nHogge shot 73 and 70 during the first two rounds on Monday, and was +1 for the tournament, in sixth place. The course, which played extremely tough throughout the tournament, played even tougher during the final round on Tuesday. Despite shooting a 75 in the final round, Hogge moved up two spots into fourth place. \nHe has now finished in the top five in back-to-back tournaments. \nComing off of their first win since 2004, the team shot +57 (312-296-313), which was good for 10th place. Freshmen Nick Wilkins and Thomas DeMarco had strong second rounds, as Wilkins shot 74 and DeMarco shot 75, but overall they strugged with the tough conditions. DeMarco was the second best finisher for the Eagles at +20 (83-75-78), tied for 45th. Senior Will Branham finished one stroke back of DeMarco at +21 (77-81-79), tied for 49th. Wilkins finished tied for 52nd at +23 (84-74-81), while freshman Matt Cholod finished in 61st at +28 (79-77-88). \nThey wrap up fall play at the UD Invitational at the NCR Country Club in Dayton, Ohio on Oct. 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:15:27.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
