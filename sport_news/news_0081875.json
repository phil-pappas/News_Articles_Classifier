He met a friend for coffee, went to his writing class and his teacher was just going over assignments, when they heard yelling in the classroom next door.\nMintz said his teacher knocked on the door asked if everyone was alright and the next thing they heard were gunshots.\n“We all took off running down the breezeway,\" wrote Mintz \"A counselor kept screaming that someone needed to tell the people in the library, and I told her I’d do it. I ran in and told everyone they needed to leave and go to the other side of the campus, I ran through the book isles while yelling and pushed the emergency exits closest to registration open and ran through them and back down towards Snyder hall.”\nMintz wrote that he ran back to the classroom and then looked through the door.\n“I could only see one of the students through the door, she was screaming and yelling and covered in blood,” wrote Mintz. “I heard the sirens coming down and yelled to the guy in the parking lot ‘you need to go get the cops, tell them where we're at.’ He couldn’t hear me so I had to repeat it a few times. All of a sudden, the shooter opened the classroom door. He leaned half of his torso out and started shooting as I turned toward him.\"\nMintz wrote that the shots knocked him to the ground.\n“He shot me again while I was on the ground and hit my finger, and said, ‘that's what you get for calling the cops’ and I laid there, ‘I didn't call the cops man, they were already on the way.’” Wrote Mintz.\n“He leaned further out of the classroom and tried to shoot my phone, I yelled ‘It’s my kid’s birthday man.’ He pointed the gun right at my face and then he retreated back into the class. I’m still confused at why he didn’t shoot me again,\" said Mintz.\nOnce help arrived, Mintz said he recognized a paramedic.\n“An EMT I am friends with was one of the first responders on the scene. I looked up and saw him walk up to the classroom door and said ‘hey buddy’ he looked at me and responded ‘hey.’ When I saw him, I knew we were all going to be ok,’” wrote Mintz.\nMintz said he was shot 5 times, but is recovering well. He wants to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, along with staff at the hospital. Mintz said they are the real heroes.\nTo read his full post visit:\n10/15/2015 I want to first thank everyone who has stepped up to help... Copyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
