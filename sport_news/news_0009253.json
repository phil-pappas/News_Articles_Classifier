QUIET!” \nThat’s when I get the advice from the 3-year-old: “Pop Pop, let it go!” \nWhere did she come up with that sound bit of advice? A few minutes later, I knew. We were listening to the soundtrack from the Disney movie “Frozen” and here was Snow Queen Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) belting out the memorable tune “Let It Go.” As so frequently happens when I hear lyrics, I find the words convey a message that is appropriate for the sports world. \nMost readers of “Coach’s Corner” are aware of my disdain for sports analysts, particularly the ones who cover Washington area teams, both college and pro. The latest media tsunami has focused on the Washington Skins’ pathetic offense and their 2–4 record. Talking heads are laying the blame of Washington’s woes squarely on the shoulders of quarterback Kirk Cousins after he has struggled for the past several games. Pundits are already calling for the return of Robert Griffin III as the starter, even though he normally isn’t even on the active roster. To all the Cousins naysayers, I offer this advice: “Let it go. Let it go!” \nLocal sportswriters and fans need to step back and take a look at the big picture. If you expected the Skins to become a playoff contender right away after coach Jay Gruden named Cousins the starter for the 2015 season, you either don’t understand the word development or you weren’t given the patience gene at birth. Becoming an NFL quarterback doesn’t happen overnight. It usually takes several years for a young QB to learn all the nuances of an offense and develop confidence in his timing with receivers. There is as much of a mental challenge as there is a physical one. \nIf you look at the top quarterbacks in the NFL, you would see that many of them had early struggles in their careers. The speed and reaction of professional defensive backs is a far cry from what most college quarterbacks have to face. Interceptions are pretty common among first-year NFL signal-callers. There is a learning curve that calls for making quicker decisions and being more aware of the different coverages they face. Passes that may have been easy completions in college can become pick-sixes at the pro level. \nWhat coaches will tell you is that it takes time and patience. And you have to surround the young quarterback with enough quality players to take pressure off him. You have to have a solid running game so that you are not faced with a lot of third-and-long situations. You have to have receivers that can get separation from defensive backs so the QB doesn’t have to throw into such tight windows. And you have to have an offensive line that can give you the protection in the pocket to allow you to step into throws confidently. \nIf we look at what the Skins have had for a supporting cast in the past several losses, you would note they have been hampered severely by injuries to wide receiver DeSean Jackson, tight end Jordan Reed, all-pro left tackle Trent Williams, center Kory Lichtensteiger and running back Matt Jones. Without Jackson and Reed, Cousins only has one NFL caliber receiver to throw to: Pierre Garçon. Opposing defenses can effectively take away a one-receiver threat. The running game went from being one of the best in the league the first couple of weeks to recently the worst. Take it from the Old Coach, to win consistently you must have an offensive line that operates as a unit. If there are missing parts, it is difficult to mount any kind of rushing attack. Timing is everything. \nCousins has the physical tools to develop into a quality QB. He has enough arm strength to make all the throws, both intermediate range and deep. He has good pocket awareness and a quick release, all that portends a successful career once he learns his limitations. As Gruden said in his postgame press conference following last week’s loss, Cousins is not ready to carry the team by himself. He needs strong contributions from his receivers, running backs, line, defense and special teams. For the Skins to win, it will take a TEAM effort. Right now, they don’t have all the pieces in place to help the young QB. \nFor the naïve media who think a change in quarterback and a return to either RGIII or backup journeyman Colt McCoy now would change the results of what is likely to be a losing 2015 season, it is clear to me that you haven’t been around sports enough to have learned that sometimes you have to build a winner and not buy one. Rome wasn’t built in a day and the Skins are going to need a season or two or three before they will be able to put a team on the field that can be of championship caliber. \nIn the meantime, heed the advice of my wise and wonderful granddaughter: \n“Let it go, let it go.” ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:26:46.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
