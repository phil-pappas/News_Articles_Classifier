Looking out on the product they helped create, a beautiful, fall evening at Wrigley Field would be pretty special.”\nThe Cubs would not be where they’re at without them. And while the kids were alright, the additions of veterans like Fowler, Miguel Montero and David Ross were also instrumental in creating the proper clubhouse culture.\n“I love numbers,” manager Joe Maddon said. “God, I love numbers, though I was horrible in math. Algebra III. Second semester of Algebra II was my Waterloo, to be honest with you. Algebra III and Trig could have been Latin or Greek, it wouldn't matter to me. But I do love numbers.\n\"Beyond that I really like people and humans and what makes this guy tick? And I don't think that because you can't necessarily quantify it, it's not as popular of a way to acquire a player, but it really matters. It really matters right now in our clubhouse. But I guess my point is it's a combination of skillful young players that everybody saw coming along. But I don't believe we would be here without the appropriate seasoning among the veterans.”\nCaption Cubs fans celebrate Chicago Cubs fans celebrate in Wrigleyville after the Cubs defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates to advance to the National League Division Series.

(WGN-TV) Arrieta speaks during clubhouse celebration Oct. 7, 2015. (WGN-TV) Some of Epstein’s special assistants were on hand Wednesday, including former Cubs pitchers Kerry Wood and Ryan Dempster. Eddie Vedder was watching in a suite with Dempster when Dexter Fowler came up in the fifth. Dempster told Vedder that Fowler would homer, and Fowler promptly homered to make it 4-0.\n“Dempster called it,” Vedder said. “It was the craziest thing.”\nThe Cubs had a long road the last four years to get to that one playoff win, and getting past the Cardinals will be even more difficult.\nBut the wild clubhouse celebration was merited, and Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer could finally enjoy their first taste of October madness in Chicago.\nWas there ever any time when they thought this rebuild wasn’t working out the way they’d hope?\n“I don’t think there was ever a point of being totally frustrated,” Hoyer said. “I think the losses were really hard. There were a lot of frustrating nights, driving home together or walking home, it was tough. Losses are really hard, especially when you’re striving for an environment like Boston, where Theo was winning 90-95 games every year.”\nMaddon’s “30-minute rule” for celebrating wins was extended on Wednesday, but when the Cubs wake up today in St. Louis they’ll be back at work, looking to extend a magical season.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs Theo Epstein Ryan Dempster Wrigley Field Joe Maddon Jake Arrieta National League", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615ee54/turbine/ct-cubs-celebration-video-spt-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615eec8/turbine/ct-cubs-fans-celebrate-video-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56165abd/turbine/ct-theo-epstein-cubs-rewards-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615e76b/turbine/ct-arrieta-clubhouse-celebration-video-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:27:50.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
