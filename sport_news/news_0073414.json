There were three or four lead changes in the fourth quarter so that was quite exciting. I was really proud of the kids and their effort. They played loose and put it all on the line and it worked out in our favor.”“We take our hats off to coach Hamilton and his group,” South Paulding coach Ed Koester said. “They played well and made a play when they needed to. We wish them well and we just hope we can win out and get ourselves back in the playoff hunt. Realistically for us, the playoffs start this week.”Senior Dondre Ledford, who finished with four touchdowns, ran for the decisive score with less than two minutes to go.“He ran the ball effectively down near the goal line,” Hamilton said. “On the first touchdown, he just willed his way into the end zone by running over one of the linebackers. As a senior, he really played like we always thought he could. It was a great effort.”Sophomore Brantley Mauldin threw for 341 yards and a score. Antonio Gandy-Golden caught 12 passes for 151 yards and Caleb Sailors rushed for 104 yards on 24 carries.“Antonio forced South Paulding into some coverages they didn’t want to play,” Hamilton said. “He was a force to be reckoned with which allowed Brantley to throw it to some other guys. They bought in their best receiver to try to cover him. One time Antonio caught the ball with three guys covering him.”Gandy-Golden has 40 catches for 646 yards and Mauldin has the third-most passing yards in the state with 1,624 yards, according to Hamilton.Next, the Patriots battle New Manchester, which also wants to climb back up the region standings like the Spartans. After winning their first three games of the season, the Jaguars have lost three in a row, including a 42-27 setback to Allatoona at home last Friday.Tabashi Thomas had four touchdowns and Brian Herrien rushed for 173 yards but Russell Halimon finished with 243 yards and four TDs to keep the Bucs atop the region standings.“We’ve almost scored exactly the same amount of points so on paper we are about the same,” Hamilton said. “Their quarterback Thomas and tailback Herrien are definitely threats. Thomas is probably the best athlete in the region.”Last year, Paulding County remained winless against New Manchester, falling 34-20 on the road. Putting an end to this slump will increase the Patriots’ playoff chances.“If we win out, we are in no matter what but if we lose to somebody we will need help to get in,” Hamilton said. “We prefer to take it one game at a time and just focus on New Manchester this week.”As far as the Spartans, they visit a much-improved Chapel Hill team this Friday.“Coach [Justin] DeShon has done a great job,” Koester said. “They are very improved.”“Last year, we were everybody’s easy game,” DeShon said. “We’re not that team anymore. The region is very well balanced.”Last season, the Panthers lost all of their games, including a 47-0 decision to South Paulding.“They are going to spread us out and run the ball,” DeShon said. “If we don’t spread out, they are going to try to throw the ball over the top. They keep you on your toes defensively and they are very physical up front on both sides of the ball.”East Paulding, which is tied for second place with Alexander, defeated Chapel Hill 24-0 last week and visits winless Lithia Springs this Friday. Last year, the Raiders cruised 57-0. After losing to Alexander 43-17 last week, Hiram visits Allatoona this Friday.In Region 4- , North Paulding hosts McEachern.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:43:09.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
