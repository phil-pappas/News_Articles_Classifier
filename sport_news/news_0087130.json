I wanted to be with the best.’’ \nRossi, 24, is the first F1 driver from the United States since Scott Speed stopped racing in 2007. Sunday’s United States Grand Prix near Austin, Texas, will be his third race since he started driving the No. 53 car for the England-based Manor Marussia team. \nHe finished 14th in Singapore despite a crash in practice and despite losing radio communications with his crew midway through the race. He was 18th in Japan and will have two more chances — Mexico and Brazil — after the Texas race to earn his spurs with the small-budget team and prove he belongs on the Formula 1 grid. \n“I’m very proud to represent the U.S. not just this week but in Formula 1 in general,’’ he said. \nHe thinks his chances of landing a ride for next year are good since he has done well in Formula 1’s feeder series, GP2. He’s in second place in the standings and has won three of the last five races for the Racing Engineering team. \nHe and his father used to go to Laguna Seca to watch the Champ Car series, a precursor to IndyCar . He may turn his designs to IndyCar if his Formula 1 dream doesn’t pan out. \nIn fact, he was three days from signing an IndyCar deal in September when his fortunes changed. “The last four months were challenging,’’ he said. “My (Formula 1) prospects seemed nonexistent. But I got a call from Marussia. It wasn’t an opportunity I could pass up.’’ \nConsidered an up-and-comer on the Formula 1 scene for several years, Rossi thinks being an American has helped him land chances as a reserve and test driver. The circuit has long wanted to expand its competitive and marketing footprint in the U.S. \n“It has opened a lot of opportunities for me,’’ he said. “If I had been a British or German driver, I probably wouldn’t have had those opportunities.’’ \nIt’s been quite a ride for a man who graduated from Forest Lake High Christian High School in Auburn (Placer County) at age 16 in order to embark on an auto racing career. \nHe had already finished third in the Skip Barber National Championship and competed in the Formula BMW USA series. In 2008 he won the overall title in that series, winning 10 of 17 races. \nHe spent most of the next several years in the GP2 series. At one point, he had lined up a spot as a reserve driver on a planned U.S.-based Formula 1 team, but it folded just before the season. \n“It was disappointing not so much for me but that there wasn’t going to be an American team,’’ he said. \nLast year he was a test driver for Caterham until the British-based team changed owners amid financial troubles. Then Marussia announced he would replace regular driver Max Chilton because of a contract dispute. But the issue was resolved, Chilton retained his seat, and Rossi went back to being a reserve driver. \nAt last year’s race in Japan, Marussia’s other regular driver, Jules Bianchi , was severely injured in an accident. The team chose Rossi as his replacement for the next race, then decided to race only one car out of respect for Bianchi and his family. Bianchi never recovered and died earlier this year. \nRossi knows he has little chance to win Sunday against the powerful Mercedes, Ferrari and Williams teams. What he really needs to do his beat teammate Will Stevens to help secure a spot for 2016. \nIf not, his opportunities to stay in Formula 1 may be running out. \nTom FitzGerald is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
