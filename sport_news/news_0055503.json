(Photo: AP / LSJ) \nThe first college football rankings of any significance are still two weeks away. The only rankings of consequence won’t come until the first Sunday of December. \nBut seven weeks into the season — on the heels of the miracle in Ann Arbor — one can feel the dialogue begin to shift toward potential postseason scenarios. \nFrom the possibility of a three-way tie atop the Big Ten’s East Division, to how an undefeated Iowa might be treated by the College Football Playoff committee, Baylor, ‘Bama and even Memphis — we’re in a who’s-in, who’s-out world. And, for the first time in 10 months, it’s almost an appropriate conversation. \nSo, let’s have it here, beginning in East Lansing. \nMichigan State’s path to the playoff is as clear as any in college football. Not easy, but understood. Keep winning, be it by the skin of its teeth or four touchdowns, and MSU will be the Big Ten champion and a national semifinalist. \nSeventh-ranked MSU doesn’t have to somehow jump over No. 6 Clemson or No. 4 TCU or anyone else. Those are Associated Press rankings. They’re not real. Try to ignore them. They’ll only confuse you later. \nAll that matters is the opinion of the College Football Playoff selection committee, which begins its weekly rankings on Nov. 3 and plays God on Dec. 6. Couch: If CFB polls must exist, then MSU should be ranked higher \nThe committee isn’t likely to accept any loss from the Spartans from here on out. That includes at Ohio State on Nov. 21. A month ago, one theory for a backdoor MSU playoff berth centered around a lone, competitive loss to the Buckeyes. Ohio State, while remaining No. 1 in the eyes of the AP voters and coaches, hasn’t played with the zest of the top team in the country. The Buckeyes’ noticeable struggles, coupled with a large field of other playoff contenders, probably and rightly eliminates MSU’s chance at a reprieve. \nThat might have been different if the Spartans had lost at Michigan Saturday, and then won their remaining games, while explaining in detail their battered offensive line to national TV pundits (who control the conversation) and committee members, who supposedly take injury absences into account, if that player later returns. It worked for Oregon a year ago, a loss to Arizona forgiven. That’s a moot point for MSU now. \nMSU will get its fair shot at the Big Ten title and playoff — both go through Columbus. A loss there would also leave the Spartans needing a perfect set of circumstances to play for a Big Ten title. \nBecause if Michigan were to beat the Buckeyes a week later to create a three-team tie in the East Division, the tiebreaker would go to the playoff committee’s highest ranked team among the three. That could be MSU, but probably only if the Spartans narrowly lost to the Buckeyes, who then were thwacked in Ann Arbor — helping the committee to reconsider the order between MSU and Ohio State, while Michigan’s two losses on the season (including Saturday at home to MSU) kept the Wolverines lower in the rankings. \nThe Buckeyes and Hawkeyes, both 7-0 like MSU, face similar playoff synopses. Don’t let anyone tell you a 13-0 Iowa team wouldn’t be chosen among the top four. Any team unbeaten from a Power Five conference is getting in, especially from the Big Ten or SEC — where the eyeballs and cash are most prevalent. The first time that doesn’t happen is the last time the playoff doesn’t include eight teams. Couch: MSU's ranking explained, system's flaws exposed \nIowa, undefeated, would be more deserving than Baylor, for example. The Hawkeyes scheduled two Power Five opponents out of conference. The Bears played their customary slate against SMU, Lamar and Rice, after deciding a stretch against Albion, Alma and Adrian would look bad. \nUnbeaten non-Power Five programs Memphis, Temple, Toledo and Houston are also probably more deserving of top-four placement than Baylor — however unrealistic — given the choices they made when left to decide their competition (Memphis and Temple might actually have an outside chance). I don’t care if you’re scoring 70 points an outing, as Baylor nearly is. You make your bed when you purposely evade any possibility of adversity. Baylor’s program has been on the rise long enough to adjust its schedule accordingly. Couch: Baylor's scheduling goof - underestimating itself \nMost of this will play itself out cleanly, as it did a year ago. Last year, five teams had a legitimate argument for four spots. This year, either Stanford or maybe Utah will emerge from the Pac-12; Clemson, Florida State or nobody from the ACC; LSU or Alabama, but likely not both, out of the SEC; Baylor, sadly, or TCU from the Big-12; and possibly one of three from the Big Ten. \nThe curveball is Notre Dame, which is 6-1. If the Irish win out, that eliminates Stanford, which hosts Notre Dame to close the regular season. That could also oust the Pac-12. \nAt most, it’s six or seven teams for four spots, at least a couple of those with a loss. Probably more with a loss and fewer than seven with an argument. \nIt could get messy for some. It won’t be for the Spartans. Win and they’re in. Six more times. \nThink of Indiana Saturday as the opening round of the NCAA basketball tournament. \nContact Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.
