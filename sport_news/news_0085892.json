Milne Field on Saturday. Fran Ruchalski for the Times-Union \nJacksonville University could finally breathe a sigh of relief in the fourth quarter in its latest win, a 41-14 pasting of Stetson on Saturday night in the first night game played at D.B. Milne Field. \nThe contest was a rousing success with a record crowd of 6,324 on hand to watch JU win its 12th consecutive homecoming contest. JU broke loose for its highest scoring output of the season, allowed its fewest points this year and for the first time in five games, won by more than four points. \nJacksonville (5-0 overall, 3-0 PFL) had averaged over 450 yards a game in its first four games but had managed an uncharacteristic 21.8 points per game. A year ago, JU scored at least 30 points in eight of its 11 games. \n“For the most part I thought our offense performed at a high level,” JU coach Kerwin Bell said. “We’re getting better. Championship teams don’t settle for staying the same. You’ll see most good teams keep getting better right to the last game. I think this team has that attitude of wanting to get better every week.” \nHis son, Kade Bell, orchestrated six scoring drives, finishing five of them with scoring passes. His totals were not quite up to what he’s been doing all season, which is topping the 300-yard mark. The former Fleming Island standout finished 23-of-40 for 247 yards and the five scores. He did throw one interception and was sacked three times. \nBell got a lot of help from the Dolphins’ defense, which came up with four interceptions and a fumble recovery, two of which three of which led to JU scores. \n“My offensive line played really well and our defense played lights out,” said Bell, the four-year senior starter said. “We’re playing hard but I think we can get a lot better. \n“That’s my job as a leader to get us going [in the second half]. We’ve come out flat some in the second half and we’ve got to understand that we need to come out the second half and really play hard and finish games.” \nJU’s coach liked the excited college atmosphere on campus. The record turnout was over a thousand more than the previous biggest JU crowd, 5,263 for a Nov. 22, 2008, game against Dayton. \n“This was just a great atmosphere, all day the excitement from the alumni and our other fans,” Kerwin Bell said. “Stetson brought up a lot of fans. \nA pair of local products figured in Stetson’s only touchdown and prevented the Dolphins from adding a sixth score. Darius McGriff, who played at Mandarin, was on the receiving end of a 55-yard scoring play from Hatters quarterback Ryan Tentler in the third quarter. \nIn the second quarter, Chris Atkins (Potter’s House Christian) recovered a JU fumble in the end zone after Damien Strange fumbled at the 1-yard line following a pass reception.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:46:00.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
