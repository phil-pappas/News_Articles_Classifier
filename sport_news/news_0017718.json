(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) \nWASHINGTON — The Maryland Terrapins announced Sunday that head football coach Randy Edsall has been relieved of his duties. \n“We appreciate Randy’s tireless commitment to the University of Maryland,” athletic director Kevin Anderson said in a news release. “This was a difficult decision, but ultimately this is the best course of action for our football program moving forward.” Related Stories Maryland pushes No. 1 Ohio State before losing 49-28 Maryland The announcement comes after multiple reports surfaced last week that Edsall would be dismissed. Edsall was hired in 2011 to replace Ralph Friedgen and compiled an overall record of 22-34 in his four-plus seasons with the Terps.\nEdsall led Maryland to bowl appearances in each of the last two years (2013 Military Bowl; 2014 Foster Farms Bowl), and signed a three-year contract extension in the offseason. \nMaryland struggled this fall though, dropping their last three games by a combined 88 points. The Terrapins are 2-4 this season, including 0-2 in the Big-10. \nEdsall’s teams went 10-24 in conference play (ACC and Big-10 combined) during his tenure and 0-12 against ranked opponents. \nAfter falling to top-ranked Ohio State on Saturday, Edsall abruptly ended his postgame press conference when he grew irritated with a line of questions. \nOffensive coordinator Mike Locksley will take over as head coach for the remainder of the season. \nThe Terps are entering their bye week and next play on Oct. 24 against Penn State from M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP.
