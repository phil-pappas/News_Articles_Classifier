Michigan State football’s Watts-Jackson, a redshirt freshman, recovered a bizarre fumble on a last-second botched punt, taking it to the end zone for a game-winning touchdown Saturday at rival Michigan. Watching that unfold live was uncanny. It was almost in slow motion, barely believable. The “Big Blue” fans shown on ESPN looked as if they’d seen Jim Harbaugh brunching in downtown Ann Arbor with an Ohio State parka and khakis on. While we haven’t encountered anything as high-profile as Sparty’s miracle in Stockton, San Joaquin County and the Mother Lode, there have been unreal plays and games unfold in my short time as a reporter at The Record. Here are five of them, the first of which came a week ago in north Stockton: Stagg State’s stunner The bellows of joy percolated through the cool October air last Friday at Ronald E. McNair football stadium. As I sat in the Eagles’ press box typing my story for Saturday’s newspaper, Stagg was departing on the bus, shouting out “Stagg State!” in celebration for all to hear. Their ecstasy was appropriate, after the Delta Kings shocked the Eagles 56-50 in a game with more twists and turns than an M. Night Shyamalan flop. Stagg had a potential game-tying touchdown called back on a penalty before half, and even more painfully, McNair had one called back in the game’s final minute. Kevin Johnson, a senior, is — statistically speaking — the Delta Kings’ fourth option at wide receiver. Yet, he had two touchdowns in the game, including a cinematic, falling-backward, one-handed grab via quarterback Lavante Bushnell. A dearth of defense can make you roll your eyes, and this game had nary a punt, with 1,100 combined yards of offense. But the last 20 minutes or so were gridiron theater. The swagger of Sierra Smith Sierra Smith, who spent most of the last St. Mary’s girls basketball season as a 13-year-old sophomore, has an exceptional resumè for someone who can’t drive a car yet. Smith, who eventually did turn 14, has such confidence that she requested to guard Mater Dei’s Katie Lou Samuelson entering the California Interscholastic Federation Open Division championship. It makes you smile when you know that Samuelson is a 6-foot-3 basketball force, who was the CIF State Player of the Year, and now, a UConn Husky. While Smith didn’t defend Samuelson much, she sent an already thunderous crowd into hysteria at Cal's Haas Pavilion, stuffing a shot from Mater Dei’s Ally Rosenblum, a 6-3 center and UCLA commit, in the final minute. As always, the 5-6 Smith was unfazed. It was only appropriate given the Rams’ phenomenal second half, where they looked more like a Pac-12 team than a group of high school girls. Surreal to watch. Shrout’s sly stoppages Matt Shrout is one of the most honest coaches I’ve reported on. And when you’re the leader of Tracy High football, in a town with an immense gridiron tradition, you have to be. Shrout, unlike most sane humans — myself included —embraces the idea of locals and alumni stopping him in the grocery store to question his play-calling or talk shop. That supreme confidence translates to the field, too, and in my opinion, is part of the roster-wide intestinal fortitude that sent No. 7 Tracy to its first Sac-Joaquin Section finals appearance in 27 years. The week before the championship game, Tracy was at No. 3 Granite Bay in a Division I semifinal, a short field goal away from losing. Shrout had all three timeouts in his pocket. And he used them. Every. Single. One. The first two attempts to ice the Granite Bay kicker didn’t matter, as the field goal try was good. By the third time, the kid didn’t even kick the ball. He knew what Shrout was thinking. Turns out, fourth time’s a charm. The field goal try went wide. Overtime came. C.J. Hawkins ran in a touchdown to take the lead. Josh Clarke nabbed an interception to clinch a finals berth. Green and gold went wild. I wasn’t here to see that one, but it was nonetheless one of the great moments in recent high school sports lore in San Joaquin County. — Contact reporter Thomas Lawrence at (209) 546-8272 or tlawrence@recordnet.com.
