Well there should exist some sort of a rule but definitely we did not hit that rule in any way whatsoever.” \nWhen pressed about when play might be halted, Hsiung said: “If the sight of the balls, to the extent that you can't see the ball, obviously you can't play. But we are far from that level of pollution.” \nPollution is a chronic problem in Beijing. In 2010 Novak Djokovic said players should have oxygen tanks on court, and two years ago Sweden's Robert Lindstedt called it “the city that cuts off days from your life”. \nDizzy spells Fans in facemasks were again a common sight this year, and world number 42 Martin Klizan said the “extreme smog” made him “cough uncontrollably after every point and I had to vomit after the match”. \nJo-Wilfried Tsonga was one of three players to fall victim to dizzy spells in the first round, when the haze was high, although one of them, Eugenie Bouchard, was concussed in recent weeks, and Petra Kvitova blamed the glandular fever she suffered earlier this year. \n“I don’t know. You know, nothing in me can calculate if it's enough oxygen for me or not. I just play tennis,” said Tsonga, when asked if he thought it was the pollution that had made him feel faint. \nKlizan later deleted his comments, made on Facebook. Most competitors have politely played down concerns over air quality or say that, after several years visiting China, they are used to it. \nHsiung did not detail any special medical facilities for the players but said there were spaces indoors where they can go when the pollution is high. \n“We have a lot of indoor facilities which include (a new) gym, so players can really enjoy themselves and do stretching etc indoors, should the weather get so bad,” he said. \n“But honestly it’s not really a lot of pollution this year as compared to previous years.\" \nChina hosts a rising number of top sports events, especially tennis, with eight Women’s Tennis Assocation and three men's Association of Tennis Professionals tournaments this year. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:57:15.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
