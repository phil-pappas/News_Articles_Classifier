Image 29 of 29 Spurs dominant through three in loss at Miami 1 / 29 Back to Gallery The Spurs dominated the first three quarters before Miami stormed back in the fourth quarter to claim a 97-94 preseason victory Monday at American Airlines Arena.\nThe Heat outscored the Spurs 26-10 in the fourth as both teams went deep into their bench. Miami ripped off a 21-3 run at one point to erase what had been a 13-point deficit entering the final period. Ray McCallum's off-balance attempt at the game-tying 3-pointer was off as time expired.\nLaMarcus Aldridge bounced back from his shaky Spurs debut in the preseason opener with 17 points and eight rebounds, while Tim Duncan added 14 points on 7-for-7 shooting. Kawhi Leonard also scored 14, and Manu Ginobili had 10.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781497/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781483/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781534/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781650/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781533/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781650/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781526/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781528/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781490/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781519/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781652/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781523/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781522/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781526/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781649/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781531/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781520/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781517/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781653/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781521/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781649/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781520/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781518/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781517/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781496/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781648/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781651/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781531/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781524/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781527/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781527/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781530/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781523/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781518/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781522/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781483/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781492/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781528/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781519/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781651/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781497/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781490/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781530/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781492/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781534/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781482/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781521/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781533/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781525/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781648/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781653/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781524/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/73/8781525/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781496/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/72/8781482/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/75/8781652/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:08:45.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
