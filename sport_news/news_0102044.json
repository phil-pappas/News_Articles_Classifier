(AP Photo/Nick Wass) \nCLEVELAND (AP) — Browns quarterback Josh McCown is silencing those chants for Johnny Manziel. \nMcCown passed for a regular-season franchise record 457 yards, two touchdowns and ran for another score in Sunday’s 33-30 overtime win at Baltimore. The 36-year-old, who went just 1-10 as a starter for Tampa Bay last season, has quieted critics and some of the fans who were clamoring for Manziel to start after he led the Browns to a win over Tennessee when McCown was injured. \nMcCown is the first Cleveland quarterback to pass for more than 300 yards in three consecutive games. He has rewarded Browns coach Mike Pettine, who didn’t buckle to public pressure and kept him in the starting lineup despite the push for Manziel. \nIt’s personal redemption for McCown, who has bounced around the NFL and played for the Hartford Colonials in the United Football League five years ago. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:25:37.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
