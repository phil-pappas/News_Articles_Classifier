Like Nebraska, they’re a big red machine that’s suffering a down season due to regime change and injuries at the skill positions. Both red clad powerhouses were expected to contend for, if not win the Big Ten West, but now the undefeated Iowa Hawkeyes seem to have that locked down. The Wisconsin Badgers have two losses, to Iowa and Alabama, two very excellent teams. In the end, they could still end up a nine or even a ten win team. Wisconsin star tailback Corey Clement was cleared to play last week against Purdue, but did not. Hey it is Purdue, so it’s the closest thing you get to a bye week (other than Rutgers and Maryland) in the Big Ten. TV (2:30 pm // Memorial Stadium // BTN) SPREAD: Wisconsin Badgers -7 I appeared on WGN’s CLTV to talk some college football this week. Here is the segment from the program “Sports Feed,” hosted by Jarrett Payton. (Yes, Walter Payton’s son) We covered a whole host of teams, including Northwestern, Illinois and the Big Ten) Expect Clement to start this week, but even if he doesn’t, freshman Taiwan Deal can carry the mail. Deal won Big Ten Freshman of the week earlier this season, just like T.J. Edwards, another Wisconsin football player did this week. Edwards, an inside linebacker, garnered the awarded because he: • Registered a career-high 16 tackles and forced a fumble in Wisconsin’s defeat of Purdue • Recorded seven solo tackles and 1.5 tackles for loss • Part of a Wisconsin defense that held the Boilermakers to a season-low 191 total yards \nIllini football preview: \nAfter the bye week, Illini football is now 4-2, and that means they just need to go 2-4 down the stretch to go bowling again (no six win Big Ten team will ever be home for the holidays in this new era of bowl expansion, don’t be shocked if a five win team somehow goes as well). Illinois received five votes in the latest coaches poll. That’s one more than Northwestern actually. \nLikely wins: @Purdue Nov 7, @ Minnesota Nov 21st \nLikely losses: Ohio St. Nov 14, @Penn St Oct. 31 \nCould go either way: Wisconsin October 24th, Northwestern @ Solider Field Nov 28th \nBelow you’ll find the audio of my weekly segment from KOZN 1620 The Zone. We talk some Wisconsin Badgers versus the Illini and the Nebraska football contest versus Northwestern: \nConsider how depleted Illinois is at the skill positions right now, and yet how close they came to beating an undefeated Iowa squad last time out. That game, a morale victory, combined with the upset over Nebraska has Illinois looking much better than in preseason expectations. If the Illini win 7+ you got to think that Bill Cubit gets another chance to be the guy in 2016. Would a bowl bid be enough to make #Cubitism a permanent thing instead of interim? Who knows, Athletic Director Mike Thomas doesn’t have a secure job himself. And when Illini basketball season gets going, and people see how bad Illinois is going to be this year, the calls for Thomas’ head are going to coming out in full force again. Here’s the link to all the latest Illini bowl projections by the way .
