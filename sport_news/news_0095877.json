The Frys.com Open had been at CordeValle in San Martin before moving to Silverado last year. \nThe plan had been to hold the event at The Institute, a private course in San Martin. A clubhouse still has not been built while waiting for regulatory approval. \nThe Safeway Open is expected to be the opening event for the 2016-17 season. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:44:29.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
