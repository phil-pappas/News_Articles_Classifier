German football federation president Wolfgang Niersbach said last week that the financial deal was made by Beckenbauer and Blatter in a private meeting in January 2002. \nBlatter had denied any knowledge of the case and FIFA also has disputed Niersbach’s account. \nNiersbach said the organizing committee had obtained a grant of 250 million Swiss francs (about 230 million euros at current rates) from FIFA, in return to payment of what now amounts to €6.7 million ($7.38 million). \nThe money was loaned by the now late French businessman Robert Louis-Dreyfus and was repaid by the German federation in 2005. \nThe entire transaction and its dubious circumstances have come under close scrutiny and heavy criticism in Germany and led to the calls for the resignation of Niersbach, although he has received support from the federation board. \nBeckenbauer said he was questioned Monday by a law firm hired by DFB to investigate the affair and repeated that there was no vote buying ahead of the 2000 vote on the host of the 2006 World Cup. \nSpiegel said the 6.7 million euros had been in a slush fund used to secure the votes of four Asian members of FIFA’s executive committee. \n“There were no votes bought to win the bid for the 2006 World Cup,” Beckenbauer said. \nNiersbach’s predecessor as DFD, Theo Zwanziger, last week accused Niersbach of lying for denying the existence of the slush fund. \nZwanziger was also in charge of finances for the 2006 organizing committee and his role in the affair also has been questioned. Zwanziger signed off on the repayment of the loan to Louis-Dreyfus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:37.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
