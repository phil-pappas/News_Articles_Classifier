Kansas City got on the board in the fourth on a hit by Eric Hossmer and then put the game away in the fifth. Losing pitcher Collin McHugh hit Salvador Perez with a pitch to start the inning. Alex Gordon then hit a ground rule double to right and Alex Rios greeted reliever Mike Fiers with a double to score both runners. After a sacrifice, Ben Zobrist hit a sacrifice fly to cap off the inning. \nKendrys Morales put the exclamation point on the night with a three run homer off Dallas Keuchel in the eighth. \nMeanwhile, Cueto was mowing down the Astros, not allowing a baserunner after Valbuenaâ€™s homer. He struck out eight and did not walk a batter in a 91 pitch performance. Wade Davis pitched a perfect ninth inning. \nKansas City will host Toronto in game one of the American League Championship Series Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:54:31.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
