It gave her friends and supporters somewhere to send all those congratulatory texts. \n\"It's blowing up!\" said Jones' mom, Shannon, joking between the tears. \nHer daughter came from four strokes down at the start of Saturday's final round to shoot 74 and win the title in the Division II girls state golf tournament on Ohio State's Gray Course. Jones' two-day 152 total was one stroke better than Kaylie Neumeister of team champion Cortland Lakeview. Monroe's Sammi Blackburn, whose 74 led after Friday's first round came back with an 80, playing in the same threesome with Jones. \n\"It's better to win by one stroke,\" Jones said, \"than to lose by one stroke.\" \nShelby junior Alexis Jones putts on No. 2 during Saturday's round of the Division II state golf tournament.

Jones was the co-leader with a sizzling 68 in the first round but ended up losing by one stroke to two-time champ Haylee Harford of Leavittsburg LaBrae. Jones' 142 total was 10 strokes better (in better conditions, incidentally), but she wouldn't trade that scorecard for Saturday's milestone victory. \n\"Last year I didn't have the experience I do now,\" Jones said. \"It wasn't about not winning the title (in 2014), it's just the way I went about playing. Win, lose or draw, I wanted to play my best today. \n\"Your mindset is a lot different when you're in the lead and maintaining. This was kind of my year. I had a passion lit under me. This was something I'll remember the rest of her life.\" \nLike his wife, Ken Jones was misty-eyed as he watched the scores go up on the board and it became apparent that his daughter and protege was the champ. \n\"I told Brad (Ruminski, Shelby's coach) it only took 12 years of working on every facet of her game — physically, mentally and spiritually,\" he said. \"I'm very grateful and thankful. It came down to her last putt. \n\"It,\" he added facetiously, \"was easy.\" \nJones' drive on the 300-yard, par 4 No. 18 ended up on the lip of a storm drain in the fairway, but she was given a free drop. She hit a great second shot, but the greens weren't holding Saturday and the ball rolled past the hole to the edge of the rough. She left herself with a 10-foot downhill putt after hitting what her dad called a \"delicate\" chip shot. \nShe made par look easy. It definitely was not. \n\"If she doesn't make that putt it could have rolled off the green,\" Ken Jones said. \"It's make it or don't win.\" \nJones liked that she was in the same grouping with Friday's front-runner. \nShelby junior Alexis Jones poses with her title medal Saturday at the Division II state golf tournament on Ohio State's Gray Course.

But I stayed focused the whole time.\" \nAs the pro at Shelby Country Club, nobody knows better than Ruminski the sacrifices Jones made to become a state champion, even having the school bus drop her off at course every day. \n\"I can't say I was shocked,\" Ruminski said about Saturday's title performance. \"I expected it.\" \nNineteen family members and backers wore red \"Team Jones\" T-shirts during the tournament and joined in the celebration, including little sister Nicole (keep an eye on her, golf fans), youth minister John Risner and Ben Olewiler, one of the stars on Crestview's 2012 state championship team. \n\"Pin placements were difficult and putting was very delicate, so you had to have some great putts,\" Ken Jones said. \"That was the key today for Lexi. She made some putts. \n\"Her game was always there, but she took a step up mentally.\" \nShelby sophomore Claire Korbas lines up her putt on hole No. 2 during Saturday's round of the Division II state golf tournament.

The Shelby sophomore shot matching 88s, making it to Columbus after taking up the game just two years ago. \n\"My scores were the same, but I had more fun today and I wasn't as nervous,\" Korbas said. \"I was full of emotion; especially the first day. Today I was more calm.\" \nKorbas chalked up this weekend as a learning experience. \n\"As far as my swing goes, I'm well equipped,\" she said. \"What I'll take away from this is that I let my emotions get the best of me, especially the first day. I was very nervous and nerves aren't helpful. I should have been more confident because I have a swing that could take me far.\" \nTim Korbas, her father, was a member of Shelby's 1980 state title team, arguably the greatest high school team north central Ohio has ever seen. \n\"Claire came up to me two summers ago and said 'Dad, I want to learn golf,'\" he said as he waited for all of the scores to come in. \"I said, OK, let's go. You've got to get out there and hit a lot of balls and play 36 holes a day. I remember living out there at the country club.\" \nHis advice to her this weekend was simple. \n\"I told her to enjoy the moment,\" Tim Korbas said. \"Nothing is more important than the shot you're over today.\" \nKEHRES AT NORTH STAR: Shelby junior Brock Kehres shot an 87 on Saturday in the Division II boys state golf tournament at North Star Resort. Combined with his 86 on Friday his final total of 173 tied for 45th in the 72-man field. \n\"I definitely think the (weather) conditions made it tougher,\" Kehres said. \"I struggled with my driver all weekend. Then I just couldn't hit many putts. It seems like I'd hit a good drive; I just wouldn't hit a very good approach shot. It seems like I had a hard time putting everything together. It felt like I couldn't get into a good rhythm.\" Buy Photo \nShelby's Brock Kehres hits his tee shot on the ninth hole Saturday during the Division II state golf tournament at North Star Resort. (Photo: Sam Blackburn/Gannett Ohio) \nHighlights for Kehres this season were winning a sectional championship and winning a 3-hole playoff to claim district runner-up honors. \n\"I'm definitely proud of what I accomplished this season,\" he said. \"Next year, I'm just going to come back and try even harder to win it. It takes a lot of hard work and a lot of hours on the golf course to get here. You've got to want it and it's all about how bad you want it. Obviously, I have a lot of things to work on and I know what I need to do to come back next year and try and get the job done.\" \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:56:19.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
