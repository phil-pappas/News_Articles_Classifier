The Wildcats (14-8, 8-6) play again at Jimmy Allen Gymnasium against Thomas Worthington on Tuesday to begin Division I tournament play, but they obviously were motivated in their final regular-season home match. \n\"A win against our rivals is great,\" Newark senior Brooke Donaker said. \"Our seniors really run the offense, but we have good defensive players with (Eden Barrett, Madisen Queen and Jamie Unternaher).\" Buy Photo Lancaster's Rachel Leitnaker spikes the ball at Newark blocker Makala Cook.

Cook and Petrella shared team lead honors with 10 kills apiece. \n\"We have been working on being very aggressive no matter where you are at,\" Newark coach Holly Culver said. \"Have a purpose for everything you do. If it's a hit, hit (it hard). If it's a tip, place it.\" \nLancaster (8-11, 4-10) did not go quietly, taking momentary control of a back-and-forth second set. Sam Taylor and Emily Cordle each had a kill, sandwiching a tandem block. \nThe Gales led 23-21, but the Wildcats rallied with Takia Barrett and Josie Grashel combining on a block, Cook delivering a kill and Barrett dropping an ace just inside the back line to finish the set. \n\"I wish we had the answer. We have been saying it all year,\" said Lancaster coach Jeff Lewis, whose team, with just three seniors, has battled inconsistency. \"I am very disappointed in our season. Our talent is as good as it needs to be. It is just that one thing none of us can put our finger on.\" \nBack-to-back Rachel Leitnaker blocks gave the Gales a 9-7 lead in the third set, but the Wildcats took the lead shortly thereafter on a Barrett kill and following ace and never looked back. \nCook and Petrella each had 14 digs, and Cook and Donaker had four blocks apiece. Tana Barrett added five kills, five aces and seven blocks, and Grashel had 37 assists. \n\"They pick us out and try to defend us individually,\" Petrella said. \"We are scrappy as a team, so we do things they don't really see coming.\" \nThe Wildcats, seeded No. 18, would visit No. 15 New Albany in a second-round match Oct. 22 if they beat the Thomas Worthington on Tuesday. A match against No. 9 Olentangy likely would follow in a district semifinal. \nLeitnaker had eight kills and six blocks and Maddy Allen 19 digs for the Gales, who seeded at 24 will host Logan on Monday before what would be a trip to No. 3 Olentangy Liberty on Wednesday. \n\"A lot of it's mental toughness, I guess,\" Lewis said. \"It's something we will need to work on in the offseason. ... We hope that at some point, we get it together. With the tournament coming up, it's time to turn it on if we are going to.\" \nksnyder@newarkadvocate.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:54:10.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
