The two new patients were not previously identified contacts being tracked by health authorities, suggesting that officials are still unable to monitor everyone exposed to Ebola. WHO spokeswoman Dr. Margaret Harris said Friday the U.N. health agency had expected to see more cases despite the recent lull in the epidemic. She added the cases were in areas where scientists knew Ebola was spreading. In an update this week, WHO said there was a \"near-term risk of further cases among both registered and untraced contacts.\" To date, Ebola has killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa.
