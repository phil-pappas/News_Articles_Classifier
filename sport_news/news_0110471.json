After losing their first four games - most were told their season is over. There's still no clear explanation why the Foothills Flyers Peewee B-Green team, based in Littleton, was disbanded. 7NEWS contacted Foothills Youth Hockey Director, Scott Smith, but he did not get back to us. Parents paid $1,900 for their children to participate, so they don’t believe it’s a financial decision. In addition, there are still three 11-12 year old teams with the same program still playing. So, parents think it's all about image. The team wasn't winning, so it was dissolved.\"I know my son was having fun, regardless of wins and losses,\" said CJ Piper. Piper says the news came down last week, when Smith sent an e-mail calling the parents to an emergency meeting. At the meeting, Smith announced the team would be disbanded.\"The program director decided it would be in the best interest of the team to do away with it. To dismantle it,\" Piper said. That decision broke the hearts of some 11 and 12 year-old-boys, and their parents.\"He was very upset, and I reassured him that it had nothing to do with him,” said Piper. “And that I was proud of him.” Piper says the season was scheduled to continue for about 20 games, well into next year. 7NEWS went to the Edge Ice Arena to track down the director. We were told he was unavailable to talk. \"I honestly think it was an image thing,” Piper said. “I think they were tired of getting beat up by all these teams. And we were. We were getting killed.\" But the kids were progressing and improving, according to Piper.“Do what you need to do from a program level after the season,” he said. “Don't take away the kids games.\" The five best players on the team were moved up to the higher performing squads. The rest were told they could remain on the practice squad. Piper is still fighting for a full refund. Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
