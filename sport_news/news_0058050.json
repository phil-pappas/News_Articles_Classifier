That occurred from the spring of 1889 to the spring of 1890. He gathered in 25 cowboy songs.\nFamous cowboy balladeer Don Edwards explained how Thorp’s sabbatical came about.\n“He was cowboying on the Bar W Ranch in Lincoln County, New Mexico. He was out toward Roswell hunting these stray horses that wandered off the property when he came to a cow camp and heard music being played,” Edwards said in a phone interview.\nIf you go\nWHAT: Cowboy balladeer Don Edwards presents “The Legend of Jack Thorp”\nWHEN: 2 p.m. Oct. 18\nWHERE: New Mexico History Museum Auditorium, 113 Lincoln Ave., Santa Fe\nHOW MUCH: $25 in advance at the Museum Shop, by calling 505-982-9543 or by visiting newmexicocreates.org or at the door “He got curious and rode up toward the wagon and heard a guy playing the banjo and singing about a horse called Dodgin’ Joe.”\nThe singer was a cowboy from another ranch, Edwards related. Thorp, he said, had never heard that song, but the encounter motivated him to ride horseback through New Mexico and Texas – 1,500 miles – in search of cowboy songs.\n“He saw the validity that this was a piece of America and he probably said, ‘If I don’t do it, nobody would,'” Edwards said.\nOn Oct. 18 in the New Mexico History Museum auditorium, Edwards will present a program of cowboy songs and stories titled “The Legend of Jack Thorp.” It will include “Dodgin’ Joe” and some of the songs Thorp found years later in newspapers and magazines.\nIn the presentation Edwards will also sing his own tribute composition, “The Ballad of Jack Thorp.”\nEdwards said Thorp returned to being a cowboy after that year, though he learned to play a banjo-mandolin, an instrument that looks like a banjo but has eight strings.\n“He took it wherever he went in his life. He joined in at campfires or in saloons or in ‘camp yards,’ places to keep your horse that were the predecessor to motels. Or to anybody who would listen to him,” he said.\nNot only was Thorp’s cowboy song collection a first but so was the published version of it. Printed in 1908 on an Estancia, N.M., press, it is also believed to be the first published collection of any American folk music, according to a New Mexico History Museum news release.\nEdwards, called the “voice of the American cowboy,” is a respected historian of American folk music for being a longtime collector of cowboy songs and stories. The National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum has repeatedly honored him for his work.\nEdwards’ 2002 album “High Lonesome Cowboy” received a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Folk Music. He appeared as a cowhand in the movie “The Horse Whisperer” and he is heard singing the song “Coyotes” on the soundtrack of the documentary film “Grizzly Man.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life07_jd_11oct_cowboy-640x483.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:22:09.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
