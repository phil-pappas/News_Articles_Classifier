We still have six undefeated teams a month into the season, which is a lot. That’s four more than made it through Week 4 unbeaten last year, when Cincinnati and Arizona (both 3–0) were the final two undefeateds.\nBut it’s a haves and have-not league as Week 5 arrives. Though there are six perfect records, there were only eight teams with winning records entering Week 5, just 25% of the league. That’s a lot of losing being done by somebody. The other 75% of the teams were at .500 or worse, with 13 losing clubs and 11 that broke even at 2–2.\nNFL Video Blanket Coverage: Rodgers vs. Brady and an O-lineman’s toughest job by Greg A.
