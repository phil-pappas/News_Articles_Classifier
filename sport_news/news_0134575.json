(Michael Laughlin / Sun Sentinel) Flanagan and its Dirty Birds defense stomps Plantation, regains control of district \nAfter a duel for district supremacy, Flanagan is back on top. \nThe Falcons used a ferocious and swarming defense to rout Plantation 35-0 Friday night, regaining control of 12-8A in a display of total dominance. \n\"I'm really proud of them,\" second-year coach Devin Bush said. \"A big district game at home, and to come out and have this type of showing. Man, it just feels so good. We just want to make sure our levels don't drop and we just keep pushing forward.\" \nIn the process, Flanagan — who entered the season as a serious state championship contender — flexed its muscles and moved into a first-place tie with the Colonels. The Falcons also seemed to live up to expectations that were in doubt after an earlier loss to South Plantation. \n\"It woke us up. And we just banded together and said, 'If you want it, you can't play like that,' \" Bush said of the loss to the Paladins back in September. \"And to come out and work hard every day and put in these long hours, I mean, these kids are just doing a tremendous thing here and it's fun to be around.\" \nFlanagan keeps dominating with their home rout of the Colonels. \nFlanagan (5-1, 3-1) senior quarterback Kato Nelson threw for 173 yards and two touchdowns in his second start this season. Nelson returned last week after having been sidelined with an offseason knee injury. \nIt was Flanagan's defense, however, that controlled this game. Nicknamed the \"Dirty Birds\" for their ferocious style of play, the Falcons held Plantation to 227 yards and forced three turnovers. \n\"That bunch right there is special. They really fly around to the ball and they get after it. They play their hearts out,\" Bush said. \nTo be sure, the Colonels were a plucky bunch, led by sophomore running back Jordan Johnson, who carried the ball 19 times for 75 yards. Despite a lack of star power on their roster, they entered their bout against Flanagan with an undefeated district record.

The Falcons have five players rated as three-star prospects or better, including Nelson, senior linebacker Devin Bush Jr., senior Dredrick Snelson and safety tandem senior Josh Metellus and senior Devin Gil. \nFlanagan set the game's tone early and raced out to a 20-0 lead while holding Plantation to 103 yards in the first half. \nIn particular, the Falcons chased, swarmed and harassed Colonels quarterback Archie Banton all night. The senior finished with 100 yards passing and no touchdowns. \nWhile Banton struggled, his counterpart, Nelson, took center stage and thrived in the spotlight. \nOn the game's opening drive, he marched the Falcons down the field with ease before handing it off to senior running back Javhari Bordeau, who sprinted 29 yards into the end zone. They failed to make a two-point conversion. \nOn the ensuing drive, Banton fumbled the ball under center on Plantation's 20-yard line. Flanagan made easy work of the Colonels' mistake when senior wide receiver Dredrick Snelson (a Minnesota commit) leaped over the goal line to put the Falcons up 13-0 early in the second quarter.Later in the period, Nelson tossed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Bordeau. \nFlanagan led 20-0 at halftime and kept things rolling in the second stanza of the game. \nIn the third quarter, Gil returned a fumble 55 yards for a touchdown. Minutes later, Nelson zipped a pass to junior receiver Clevan Thomas, who sprinted 50 yards into the end zone. \nThe flurry of scores seemed to sap Flanagan's spirits and a running clock — which is used to speed up the pace of blowout games — was put into play. \nPrior to Friday's game — which was, believe it or not, the first meeting between these two schools separated by just 14 miles — Plantation coach Steve Davis played down his team's matchup against Flanagan. \"Every week in our district,\" he said, \"it's so hard.\" \nAnd on this night, the Falcons proved they might be the hardest challenge of all. \n\"To win this game and actually probably put ourselves back in the driving seat,\" Bush said, \"it feels pretty good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:27:26.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
