And I’m not speaking about football. (In) football I’m ready to accept any kind of criticism, even the stupid ones. \n“Private life and stupid things that you bring to light, I don’t like it. So we go to a different level of professional relationship.” \nIn separate videos, Mourinho was harangued by teenagers, whose complaints were published by media outlets. \nChelsea backed Mourinho saying he was being interrupted while on the phone and the teenagers’ actions go “beyond the grounds of reasonable behavior”. \nMourinho’s comments yesterday are a far cry from the affection for England he expressed before leaving Real Madrid two years ago and returning to Chelsea for a second spell in charge. “I know in England I am loved,” he said in May 2013. “I’m loved by the fans. I’m loved by the media that treats me in a fair way.” \nMeanwhile, Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany faces an anxious wait to see if he will be picked for tomorrow’s league derby at Old Trafford but manager Manuel Pellegrini has played down any rift with the Belgian defender. \nKompany has not started either of City’s last two games, since the international break, and could find himself on the bench again against Manchester United in the 170th derby. \n“I need to choose a starting 11 every week that I think best for that game. Other players must wait. It’s exactly the same for all the players,” Pellegrini told reporters. \nKompany injured his calf in September but returned to action this month for Belgium — a situation that reportedly upset Pellegrini who felt he was taking a risk. Since then Kompany was an unused substitute against Bournemouth and came on in the final minutes in the Champions League win over Sevilla on Wednesday. \n“I’m not punishing Vincent. I have no problems in my relations with Vincent,” Pellegrini, whose side has a two-point lead over United at the top, said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:56:17.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
