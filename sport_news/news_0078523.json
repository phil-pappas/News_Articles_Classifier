And because of it, the Eagles offense couldn’t get out of neutral all day.\nThe Eagles fell to 3-5 overall and 0-5 in the Atlantic Coast Conference and must win their final four games to become bowl eligible. BC hosts Virginia Tech (3-5, 1-3 ACC) on Saturday at Alumni Stadium.\n“It was very tough and it was on us the offensive line,” Eagles left guard Harris Williams, a sixth-year graduate student from Lynn, said. “We have to come back next week. We have to be better and it’s nobody else’s fault besides us. It’s hugely uncharacteristic of Boston College. You know it’s our pedigree and it is something we pride ourselves on. It is something that is really getting to us.”\nThe offensive output was dismal despite favorable field position provided by the Eagles defense, which forced four Louisville turnovers. BC gained just 79 yards of total offense on 52 snaps. Breaking it down, the results were minus-14 yards on 30 rush attempts and 93 yards through the air on 22 attempts (nine completions).\nSixty-four of BC’s passing yards came on two plays: a wheel route by tailback Myles Willis (36 yards) and Thadd Smith’s go route down the right sideline (28).\n“I’ve got to one step at a time address what happened with the young offensive line here and go back to work and fix it,” coach Steve Addazio said.\nWhen BC tried to attack through the air, Louisville defenders wreaked havoc on the quarterbacks. Starting QB Jeff Smith, who left the game in the third quarter after suffering a head injury, was sacked six times. Smith was replaced by redshirt freshman Troy Flutie, who met the ground twice.\nSmith was strip-sacked by Cardinals cornerback Trumaine Washington early in the second quarter and the fumble was returned 46 yards for a touchdown by defensive end Sheldon Rankins. The Cardinals’ final sack on Flutie was on a fourth-and-12 on the BC 45 with 1:17 to play.\n“Whether we were throwing play action on first and second down or whether we were throwing drop back, we couldn’t protect the quarterback,” Addazio said. “My mind just goes to eight sacks.”\nBC’s stable of tailbacks endured seven tackles for loss as the injuries piled up. Smith suffered what appears to be a concussion on an 8-yard touchdown run with 2:55 to play in the third. Addazio will update Smith’s status for Virginia Tech at this afternoon’s press briefing at Conte Forum.\nThe quarterbacks weren’t the only ones being attacked.\nTailbacks Tyler Rouse and Marcus Outlow had to leave the game with minor injuries after combining for no yards on three carries. Willis carried the ball 12 times for 22 yards with a sore shoulder. BC has been without featured back Jon Hilliman since he suffered a fractured left foot against Northern Illinois on Sept. 26.\n“I don’t think I have seen a season with so many running backs getting depleted like this,” Addazio said. “We are a run team and we kind of got taken out of that game because of personnel.”", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=BC%E2%80%99s+effort+really+crosses+the+line"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:03:07.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
