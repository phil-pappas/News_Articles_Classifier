Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 12:00 am Mullen's TD on final play gives Fenwick win over Austin Prep By Matt Jenkins Staff writer Salem News \nPEABODY — It takes the wisdom and experience of a man who has been a high school football head coach for 37 years to perfectly sum up what happened last night on Bishop Fenwick’s Donaldson Field. \n“They’re the champs,” Austin Prep’s legendary coach Bill Maradei said about the Crusaders. “You want to beat the champions, boy you better make a play with five seconds left.” \nAustin Prep, at the time clinging to a one-point lead, could only watch in horror as Fenwick senior wide receiver Cody Mullen stepped in front of a Cougar defensive back and snatched freshman quarterback Cory Bright’s pass out of the air just over the goal line to give the Crusaders a stunning 26-21 victory in the final seconds. \nMullen, a team captain, has been well entrenched as Fenwick’s play-maker since the beginning of the season, but now it seems he has some company in that category. \nWith the game on the line, Fenwick coach Dave Woods felt comfortable putting the game in the hands of a freshman signal caller who has been splitting snaps at the position through the first five games. As for who was going to be targeted on the final play, there wasn’t much sideline debate. \n“The last play we said, ‘We’re throwing it to Cody.’ We tried to split the defenders a little and send Cody down the seam,” Woods said. “As soon as we broke the line, I could see the play develop and said to myself, ‘This is going to be a touchdown.’ Cody got position on him and he went up and made the play.” \nIt was a play that seemed completely unlikely only 47 seconds before. \nAustin Prep’s Matt Liberacki scored on a 1-yard touchdown and Cougar quarterback Dan Monagle hit Luke Wyman for the two-point conversion, which put Fenwick behind 21-20 with only 47 seconds left. \nAfter a squibbed kickoff, Fenwick took over at its own 40 yard line. \nBright threaded a needled on first down, hitting Isaiah Cashwell-Doe for a 24-yard gain. Three straight incomplete passes left Fenwick with a 4th-and-10 from the Austin Prep 36-yard line, and only 13 seconds remaining. \nMullen snatched a first-down catch over the middle and Fenwick called timeout with five seconds left, setting up the game-winning score. \n“I just told (Cory) to throw the ball within five feet and I’d make the play,” Mullen said. “He threw it to the inside, I broke to the inside and I beat the kid to the ball. That’s about it; I just out-jumped him.” \nBright did everything he was supposed to do on the play. He stood tall in the pocket while facing a heavy rush from Austin Prep, and threw the ball where Mullen could make a play. \n“I’ve never seen a quarterback with that composure, especially a freshman,” Mullen said. “The fourth quarter, the game’s on the line, last play of the game, it’s unbelievable. Really, the kid’s a stud.” \nBright finished with 189 yards passing and four touchdowns, three to Mullen and one to Willie McGuiness for 28 yards that gave Fenwick a 20-13 lead in the fourth quarter. \nMullen, meanwhile, had a monster game with nine catches for 133 yards. He also led the Crusaders in rushing with 43 yards on three carries, which included a first-down pickup on a fake punt. Mullen completed that play by hurdling an Austin Prep defender to gain the extra yards. \nFenwick needed all the extra yards it could get against Austin Prep, which chewed up nearly all the first quarter while taking a 7-0 lead. The Cougars then scored quickly early in the fourth quarter, needing only three plays to go 73 yards to take a 13-12 lead. \nThe Crusaders have a young team, but they stayed focused and got the stops and made the plays when they had to. \n“You really can’t give up. They had the ball for almost the whole first quarter. You can’t let it get to you that they keep getting first downs. All it takes is one big stop,” Mullen said. “I was trying to keep them all composed. They were starting to get nasty with each other. You gotta calm down in situations like that. As we just saw, you never know what’s going to happen. You just gotta play your game no matter what the situation is, no matter how much time is left on the clock, no matter what the score is. You just gotta do what you’re supposed to and let things play out.” Sign Up / Sign In  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:48:41.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
