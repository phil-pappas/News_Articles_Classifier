How times have changed for Bosh.\nThis has been arguably the most critical preseason since he arrived in 2010 because of the new starting lineup. With Friday's game at New Orleans being the last exhibition, the Heat are still adjusting to their different parts.\n\"We haven't gotten the time that we've we wanted to on the court,\" Bosh said. \"I'd like to have a couple more [preseason] games. I've learned to be patient. We can always get caught up and want the season to be here. We're not ready for the season right now. Not yet. We need to use [Friday's] game wisely and really continue to work on what we need to work on.\"\nThe starters have had little time together on the court, mostly because of center Hassan Whiteside being sidelined due to a calf strain. Whiteside has played just two exhibition games. With guard Goran Dragic sidelined against the Pelicans because of illness, the Heat will play yet another game not at full strength.\n\"Just getting them on the floor,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of his biggest coaching obstacle. \"We're confident that group will be effective. They just need more time to work together.\"\nBosh and guard Dwyane Wade have been here before. They endued a similar process in 2010, the first year they teamed up with LeBron James in Miami. That team needed at least a month before hitting full stride.\n\"It's just the process of getting used to something new,\" Wade said. \"The biggest thing is going to be once we realize we need each other to be successful. We can't do it individually. We'll be fine. It's just going to take a little while â€¦ The good part is we got so much potential in our lineup. We'll figure it out.\"\nPreview: Miami Heat at New Orleans Pelicans, 8 p.m. Friday Ira Winderman When/Where: 8 p.m., Smoothie King Center, New Orleans.\nTV: Fox Sports Sun.

This is the only game the Pelicans will play on their home court this preseason, with their previous \"home\" exhibitions in Jacksonville...\n(Ira Winderman) The Heat have experienced the normal woes of a team adjusting to playing together. They are dealing with spacing issues while also getting used to a faster offensive pace. Bosh said the goal is to play at a higher tempo while avoiding taking quick shots.\n\"Everybody is pressing so hard to make plays that we're not always making plays for each other,\" Bosh said. \"We're trying to do it by ourselves now. That's one of the biggest challenges that you have to overcome when you have a lot of talent. You have to learn how to do it together. It's a huge challenge but we'll get there. We've done it before.\"\nDefense Green's priority\nOffense has never been a concern for guard Gerald Green . He's always had the ability to score.\nThe knock on him has always been defense, which is why Green made it a priority to improve on that end. Green has averaged 19 points the past five preseason games but is more concerned about fitting into the Heat's defensive system.\n\"I'm just trying to focus on the defensive end,\" Green said. \"That's where I'm really trying to get better at this year. I told myself when I joined this organization that I wanted to be the best defender I can be. I'm taking the right steps so I can help this team win.\"\nLast year Green, who played with the Phoenix Suns, was publicly criticized by coach Jeff Hornacek because of poor defense.\n\"You have to have a certain maturity to be able to take criticism,\" Bosh said of Green. \"It's not always what you want to hear sometimes but sometimes it's necessary even coming from bad sources. There's always a bit of truth in criticism, and you have to kind of put your ego to the side.\"\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n Miami Heat Chris Bosh Hassan Whiteside Dwyane Wade New Orleans Pelicans Erik Spoelstra Phoenix Suns", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5628585b/turbine/sfl-photos-washington-wizards-at-miami-heat-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56294db5/turbine/fl-miami-heat-main-1023-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626e8be/turbine/sfl-miami-heat-new-orleans-pelicans-preview-s102215"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:05:10.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
