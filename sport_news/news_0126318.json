Zetterberg, who scored his second goal of the season Tuesday, has seven points through Detroit's first three games. \nZetterberg had three assists in the Wings' season opener, and a goal and assist Saturday against the Hurricanes. In addition to Tuesday's goal, Zetterberg assisted on Gustav Nyquist's second-period goal. \nZetterberg's goal was set up beautifully by none other than rookie sensation Dylan Larkin . Larkin sent a nifty centering pass through a Tampa Bay Lightning defender's legs, and Zetterberg buried the puck in the back of the net. \n\"He's playing well and the nice thing with him is working hard,\" Zetterberg said of Larkin. \"He always works hard in practice and in games doing everything right.\" \nON THE SCOREBOARD \nNyquist and Kyle Quincey both scored their first goals of the season Tuesday. Nyquist, who drew a tripping penalty late in the second period, scored 12 seconds into the power play with a quick shot over Ben Bishop's left shoulder. \nQuincey scored an empty net goal with less than two minutes remaining in the game to ice the victory for the Red Wings. \nSEASON DEBUT \nTomas Jurco , who was a healthy scratch for Detroit's first two games, made his season debut Tuesday. Jurco skated on a line with Brad Richards and Tomas Tatar , recording one shot, four hits and one takeaway in 11:17 of ice time. \nPLAYOFF REMATCH \nTuesday's game marked the first rematch between the Red Wings and Lightning since the two teams met in the first round of the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs. Tampa Bay defeated Detroit in Game 7 of the series and eventually advanced to the Stanley Cup Championship, where the Lightning fell to the Blackhawks. \nUP NEXT \nThe Red Wings will host the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday, Oct. 16 (7 p.m. pregame, 7:30 face-off on FOX Sports Detroit).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:02:15.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
