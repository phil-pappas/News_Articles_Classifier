(Photo: File photo) 81 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWISCONSIN RAPIDS â€” Connor Dolan was the front runner on an upstart Assumption boys cross country team that qualified as a team for the WIAA state meet for the first time in school history last year. \nDolan and a young Royals squad travel to Nine Mile Recreation Area Friday for a Division 3 sectional race with the hopes of making their second straight trip to The Ridges. \n\"He's really dedicated himself to cross country this year,\" Assumption coach Gary Pritchard said. \"He ran over 500 miles this summer and came into the season in really good shape and has taken off from there. \n\"He needs to work on his finishing at the end of a race, but he's developed a knack for going out and staying in contention in a race.\" \nWere you satisfied with your runner-up finish at the Marawood Conference meet last Thursday? Yeah. I was expecting that considering who I was running against (Kevin Koski of Chequamegon). There was some tough competition and I beat everyone else. \nWhat did you learn about last year's state tournament experience that you've applied to your races this year? I've learned that it's important to stay focused during a race. If you don't, you'll slow down and get passed. You have to go try to catch the person ahead of you for the whole race. \nWhat is the most important aspect of your training for sectionals this week? Taking care of my body and eating right. It looks like we might have some nice days this week, but when it gets colder you have to stay warm so you don't get hurt. \nWhat is the toughest course you've run and why? The course at the Ripon Invite was hard. The competition wasn't that great, but the course was really tough. It was a hilly course and there was a big one in the last mile that killed me. \nWhat are some things you want to accomplish by the time you're 30?: Graduate med school and become a doctor and hopefully start a family of my own, but probably not as big as my family. I want to be a surgeon, but I'm not sure if I want to be an orthopedic surgeon or a general surgeon. \nSpeaking of your family, what are the pros and cons of being one of nine siblings? There's always someone to hang out with and be competitive with. I have my own room now, but there was a time that four of us were in a room. As far as a con, there are lots of arguments. \nWhat is your biggest fear? As a Catholic, my biggest fear is that I'm not going to make it to heaven. \nTell us something that people would be surprised to know about you: I pray the rosary before and after each race. \nWho is someone from history that you'd like to meet and talk with? Steve Prefontaine. I'd like to learn how he trained to be so fast. \nMark Massoglia can be reached at 715-423-7200, ext. 4736 or mark.massoglia@gannettwisconsin.com .
