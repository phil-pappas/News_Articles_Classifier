(Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \nPHILADELPHIA It's October, and there are head coach openings at major college football programs. \nSo of course rumors are circulating that Eagles coach Chip Kelly might be a candidate at schools like Southern California, South Carolina and Maryland. \nKelly has responded to similar rumors since he joined the Eagles in 2013. On Thursday, he seemed angrier when asked about the speculation. Kelly denied that USC or any other school has contacted him or his agent. He joked instead that North Texas has contacted him. \n\"Just keep asking questions like this in press conferences and it'll be over quicker,\" Kelly said. \"Let's talk about another college. You've got 10 minutes, so let's talk about North Texas. I know you have an obligation, and I understand that. It's going to happen. We're not successful, we're not winning, I came from college and I'm going to go back to college.\" \nThen Kelly referenced Giants coach Tom Coughlin when he said: \"I hope someday, it'll be like Coach Coughlin, win enough games where I can stay around long enough where that speculation ends.\" \nKelly was then asked if it's a distraction for him. \n\"It's an unfortunate part of the game because the other part of it is there are people who have lost their jobs,\" he said. \"A friend of mine in [former USC coach] Steve Sarkisian is dealing with a big issue right now. I wish him the best out of the whole thing and that's how I look at the whole thing.\" \nKelly was referring to Sarkisian, who is dealing with an alcohol problem. Sarkisian was put on indefinite leave of absence last weekend, then fired two days later. \nKelly was also asked if the rumors undermine his authority with the players. \n\"Our players couldn't care less about it,\" he said. \"Ask them, I guess. I don't think Jason Kelce is concerned that my name came up with a college. He's concerned with going against [Giants' defensive coordinator] Steve Spagnuolo's defense, which is first and foremost on our team right now.\" \nIn other news: \n>> Kelly said Sam Bradford is asserting himself more with his teammates, which is only natural after coming over in the spring and trying to establish himself. Kelly said Bradford was much quieter in April and May. As for Bradford's slow starts – the Eagles have just three points in the first quarter in five games – Kelly said that's true for the offense as a whole. \n>> WR Nelson Agholor (ankle), LB Mychal Kendricks (hamstring), LB Kiko Alonso (knee) and DE Brandon Bair (groin) didn't practice for a second straight game. ESPN is reporting that Giants CB Prince Amukamara could miss 3-4 weeks with a pectoral muscle injury. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com . Follow on Twitter @Mfranknfl.
