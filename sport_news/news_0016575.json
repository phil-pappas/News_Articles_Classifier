LOUIS — During his pregame interview Saturday at Busch Stadium, Cubs manager Joe Maddon provided a rare one-word answer when asked if he thought about keeping hot left-handed hitter Kyle Schwarber in the lineup even with lefty Jaime Garcia on the mound.\n\"No,'' Maddon said before the Cubs' 6-3 victory over the Cardinals.\nThere was an awkward pause.\nMaddon is the guy most likely to break the silence in an elevator, but he never elaborated. It implied Maddon was as certain as he was succinct heading into Game 2 of the National League Division Series, like he knew something the rest of us didn't. By the time right fielder Jorge Soler, Schwarber's replacement, homered and reached base four times and the Cubs scored twice on back-to-back safety-squeeze bunts, everybody understood the sly smile on Maddon's face.\n\"We needed to do something different,'' catcher Miguel Montero said.\nThe Cubs needed their Maddon scientist to concoct a winning chemistry and he did, inserting Soler and employing the same bunt strategy two straight batters — something he guessed happens once in \"a Harvest moon.''\nThey needed a big hit to break the tension and Soler delivered a 407-foot, two-run homer in the decisive second inning that perhaps changed the series by the time it landed. They needed to remind the Cardinals they weren't ready to concede a baseball coronation just yet.\nKyle Hendricks on his Game 2 start Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks talks about his performance in his Game Two start.\nCubs starter Kyle Hendricks talks about his performance in his Game Two start.\nSee more videos As a result, it feels as if the Cubs will return to Chicago for Monday's Game 3 leading the series 1-1. With Jake Arrieta pitching at Wrigley Field, where he hasn't lost since July 25, winning Game 2 felt like a two-for-one playoff special.\n\"Getting Jake pitching (Monday), it's kind of a good thought for us,'' Maddon acknowledged.\nHad the Cubs lost to go down 2-0 to the Cardinals, the fat lady at the Opera Theatre down the street would have started clearing her throat. Instead, momentum suddenly favors the Cubs, who won the type of white-knuckle game Maddon was hired to win, due partly to playing a brand of \"small ball\" he rarely endorses.\nServiceable starter Kyle Hendricks gave up only four hits in 41/3 innings — three were solo home runs — and relievers Travis Wood and Trevor Cahill did yeoman's work. Closer Hector Rondon notched the Cubs' first postseason save in 12 years. But this game wasn't won between the lines as much as it was between Maddon's ears.\n\"I love that word, by the way,'' Maddon said sarcastically when a reporter referenced small ball.\nMaddon might not be a big fan of the bunt, but it worked. While the Cardinals imploded, committing two errors, the Cubs improvised, using consecutive bunts from pitcher Hendricks and Addison Russell to manufacture their first two runs, Maddon-style. He compared the play to the Packers' sweep of the late 1960s.\n\"You had (Jerry) Kramer, you had (Paul) Hornung, you had (Jim) Taylor, you knew it is coming, but if you do it properly, you can't stop it,'' Maddon said.\nJust when Maddon's bunting magic took Twitter by storm in the second, Soler took Garcia deep to center in case anybody forgot how much the Cubs live off the long ball. The five-run outburst rattled Garcia, who left with a stomach virus after an inning that made Cardinals fans sick, and revitalized a Cubs team that sleepwalked through a Game 1 loss.\nDuring that loss Friday, it was the aggressive way Soler ran from first to third after entering the game that Maddon says persuaded him to make a change. Since returning from injury late last month, Soler has improved his plate discipline, which Maddon attributed to the advice of assistant hitting coach Manny Ramirez. Soler grinned recalling the prediction Montero shared with him in the clubhouse.\n\"I was talking to Miguel before the game and he came up to me and said, 'You could have a real good game, and he was right,' '' Soler said. \"I was very, very happy.''\nCardinals manager Mike Matheny, on the other hand, looked very, very mad. His team's display was utterly un-Cardinals like, a performance as sloppy as it was sharp 24 hours earlier. Things shifted so quickly that Matheny evaded a question postgame wondering whether he might start John Lackey in Game 4 on three days' rest if the Cardinals lose Monday.\n\"It is hard to watch a club that's played so well do things so uncharacteristic defensively,'' Matheney said.\nIn character postgame, Maddon brought up Bell Hop's Bar in Hazleton, Pa. He traded banter with a fan in the hallway who reminded him of the \"Back to the Future Part II\" World Series prediction. He made it sound like a good thing that the Cubs have won two of three playoff games this week without Anthony Rizzo or Kris Bryant getting a hit. He encouraged Chicago to have as much fun as he is watching a young Cubs team that only will become more dangerous the longer it stays alive.\n\"If you're a fan and don't enjoy this, you're not doing it properly,'' Maddon said.\nThe man was right again.\ndhaugh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Baseball Joe Maddon Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Jorge Soler Jaime Garcia", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619d13a/turbine/ct-kyle-hendricks-20151010", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619da7d/turbine/ct-cubs-haugh-spt-1011-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-11T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:08:28.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
