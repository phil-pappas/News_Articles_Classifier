Sources said multi-layer security rings will be set up within 15 km from the border areas in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim.\nOfficials said security infrastructure and intelligence network along the border would be enhanced in the next six months. The home ministry has been repeatedly getting inputs on anti-India activities like movement of Jehadi elements and smuggling of fake Indian currency notes and narcotics along the Nepal border.\nOf the 1,751 km long border, 263 km is in Uttarakhand, 560 km in Uttar Pradesh, 729 km in Bihar, 100 km in West Bengal and 99 km in Sikkim.\nThe supply of essential goods to Nepal have been squeezed following violent agitation in southern plains by Madhesi parties over the newly-promulgated Constitution. More than 40 people have died in clashes between police and protesters.\nThe Madhesis - Indian-origin inhabitants of the southern plains - and Tharu ethnic groups are protesting for more representation in the constitution.\nNepal has alleged that India has imposed an 'economic blockade' on the country following the announcement of its constitution. But India sees no merit in Nepal's complaints that it was being 'choked' and deprived of essential supplies.\nOne of the main transit points at Birgunj bordering the Indian city of Raxaul has been blocked for over two weeks. Other check-points at Bhairahawa-Sunauli and Biratnagar-Jogani, however, have been partially opened.\nIn the meeting, the home minister also reviewed the infrastructure development projects along the Indo-Nepal border.\nA detailed presentation was made by the Border Management Division of the ministry on administrative and environmental clearances for projects in the border areas.\nThe progress of border roads in Bihar, UP and Uttarakhand was discussed. The issue of connectivity and communication in the border states was also taken up at the meeting.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-16T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:54:45.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
