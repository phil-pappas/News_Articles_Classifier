Among starters with at least 150 innings, Noah Syndergaard was No. 1 overall at 97.1 mph, with Matt Harvey (95.9 mph, 4th) and Jacob deGrom (95.0 mph, 9th) close behind.\nThey’ve overpowered hitters in the postseason with Harvey’s .229 opponents batting average and 2.84 ERA the highest of the trio.\nWhile the Mets can bring the heat on the mound, the Royals are great at putting the ball in play.\nKansas City hitters had the highest contact rate in the majors this season at 81.9% as well as the lowest walk rate (6.3%). Meanwhile, Mets starters had the best strikeout-to-walk rate (4.18) in the majors during the regular season.\nThe dramatic contrast in styles will make it easy to see which team executes its game plan more effectively when the Royals are at bat.\nMets’ early birds vs. Royals’ comeback kids.\nThe Mets never trailed as they swept all four games from the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS.\nPart of that has to do with the dominance of their starting pitchers, but the Mets offense has also been up to the challenge. They’re averaging nearly five runs per game in the postseason – and that’s with six of their nine games coming against starters Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke, Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester.\nThe Royals, meanwhile, had to win the final two games of their AL division series against Houston to advance. Down 6-2 in Game 4, the Royals exploded for seven runs over the final two innings to pull even.\nIn Game 2 of the ALCS, Kansas City scored five runs in the seventh inning against Toronto Blue Jays ace David Price to grab a 2-0 lead. In Game 4, the Royals blew open a close one with nine runs over the final three innings. And in Game 6, they had to overcome a game-tying two-run home run from Jose Bautista, forging ahead with a rally of their own in the eighth inning to produce a 4-3 victory.\nAlthough the Royals finished 24th in home runs during the regular season, they ranked No. 7 in scoring. That’s because their high-contact approach has enabled them to string together hits that lead to big innings.\nDaniel Murphy vs. history.\nNo one’s ever had an October quite like the one Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy is currently enjoying. He’s hit a home run in a record six consecutive playoff games, racking up a .421 average, 1.026 slugging percentage, 11 runs scored and 11 RBI in the postseason.\nWhile players often talk about being “in the zone,” the one thing they want to do when they get there is keep playing. With the Mets sweeping the NLCS, Murphy and the Mets will have been idle for six days before taking the field for the World Series opener.\nThe law of averages says Murphy couldn’t possibly continue his home run streak. Then again, Murphy’s been defying those laws throughout the postseason.\nRoyals’ bullpen vs. Mets’ sluggers.\nAlthough the Toronto Blue Jays had 11- and 7-run outbursts in the ALCS, most of that damage came against ineffective starting pitchers. The power trio at the back of the Royals bullpen – Wade Davis, Kelvin Herrera and Luke Hochevar – have allowed a total of one earned run in 20 1/3 innings this postseason. That’s a 0.45 ERA.\nIncluding Murphy’s heroics, the Mets have a total of 14 home runs in nine playoff games. The addition of Yoenis Cespedes at the trade deadline ignited the Mets offense down the stretch and they finished third in the majors in scoring and fourth in OPS after the All-Star break. And Cespedes now has a .311 batting average and .500 slugging percentage in 78 career playoff appearances.\nIf the World Series games are close in the late innings, this will be a thrilling matchup to watch.\nRoyals manager Ned Yost vs. Mets manager Terry Collins.\nYost has demonstrated an ability to adapt – sometimes after a couple missteps – his thinking in the postseason. We saw him stay with starting pitchers Edinson Volquez and Yordano Ventura a little longer than perhaps he should have in the sixth inning of Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS.\nThe results were mixed with Volquez getting out of the inning unscathed, but Ventura giving up a pair of runs. But then in Game 4, Yost pulled starter Chris Young at the perfect time with two outs in the fifth.\nYost doesn’t platoon on offense and rarely pinch-hits for his starters, so his biggest decisions will be in how he handles his pitching staff.\nCollins’ one major change in managerial philosophy from the regular season to the postseason has been in turning the Mets loose on the basepaths. They stole just 51 bases in 162 regular season games (second-fewest in the majors), but they lead the postseason with nine steals in nine games. Right fielder Curtis Granderson has four steals, including a daring theft of third base in Game 2 of the NLCS against Cubs ace Jake Arrieta.\nThe only change Collins has made with his lineup is in left field, where he’s had rookie Michael Conforto start against right-handed pitchers and Juan Lagares or Michael Cuddyer in there against lefties.\nCollins has also not been shy about bringing in closer Jeurys Familia for more than one inning to nail down the victory. No one can blame him, considering the results. Familia is 5-for-5 in save opportunities and has yet to allow an earned run in 9 2/3 postseason innings.\n© Peter Aiken, USA TODAY Sports Peter Aiken, USA TODAY Sports Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmjoYh.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmo5Ua.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Estrada", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Top", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfDN06.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Marco", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmjywn.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Check"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:41:27.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
