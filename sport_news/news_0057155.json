Whether he draws Eichel or another centre such as Ryan O'Reilly, it's going to be another test for the young Leafs defenceman and his chaperone, Matt Hunwick. \nFIVE KEYS TO THE GAME \nBab Talk \nThis is the first official visit for Mike Babcock to Buffalo, the team he spurned for the Leafs last May. The good folks in Western New York don't take these decisions well and it will no doubt be another part of the revived Buffalo-Toronto rivalry with counterpart Dan Bylsma in the years to come. \nDull Knives \nBuffalo is hoping the Leafs' inconsistent goaltending will linger through Wednesday. Winning just once in five games, the Sabres have also managed just one goal in three of the four setbacks. You can say they're due. \"I think we've got to keep it a little simple,\" forward Tyler Ennis told the Buffalo News. \"We've got to support all over the ice. Make sure we get it in, get it back to the point, get traffic in front of the net. It's really simple things. We're getting a lot of shots. We're playing hard. I think maybe we're gripping it a little too tight but it will come.\" The Sabres had just 161 goals all of last season. \nCentre of attention \nThe injured Tyler Bozak will be missed on Wednesday, with 16 career points in 21 games against the Sabres lifetime, including five last season. But every Leaf seems to have his personal demons at First Niagara Center. \nMoulson Canadian \nToronto-area product Matt Moulson led the Sabres with seven points against Toronto last season, compared to getting 41 points overall. \nFace of success \nThe Leafs are maintaining a 54.6% positive record in the faceoff dots so far, second in the NHL. Buffalo is bottom 10 at well under 50%. \"That's the easiest 1-on-1 battle in the game,\" Babcock said. \"You might as well bear down on that and get wingers to help out. There are a number of ways to keep the puck as long as you can. When you have it, you don't have to defend, you don't have to go to the penalty box.\" \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nLEAFS -- PP 13.3% (23rd), PK 75.0% (24th) \nSABRES -- PP 23.8% (9th), PK 66.7% (28th) \nSICK BAY \nLEAFS -- D Stephane Robidas (knee), C Tyler Bozak (lower body) \nSABRES -- G Robin Lehner (ankle), D Zach Bogosian (lower body) Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:08:39.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
