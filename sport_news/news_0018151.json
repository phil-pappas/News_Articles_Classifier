Early detection is the key to survival. October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.Students, faculty, parents as well as the general public who wear pink to the Cyclones Dig Pink match tonight will gain admission for $1.The Lady Cyclones will wear special pink jerseys.The event raised $3,500 for breast cancer research last year. Junior varsity games will tipoff a 4:30 p.m. with the varsity immediately afterward.
