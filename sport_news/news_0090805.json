Watson completed 9 of 14 passes -- three to Maxwell for 109 yards -- while Mitchell rushed 24 times for 160 yards. \nDawson County needed every ounce of effort from the trio to outdo 321 yards passing from the Vikings (1-4, 1-1) -- 269 of that from Austin Parker, who also tossed two touchdown passes -- one each to Jacquen Hopkins (8 receptions, 154 yards) and Markese Jackson (7 receptions, 62 yards). Parker also ran for two scores and 48 yards. Jiel Vargas also added 79 yards rushing and a touchdown, while Jackson added 59 yards and a score on the ground. \nEast Hall's progress was hampered by four turnovers, though the Vikings never gave in, pulling within a touchdown with 1:39 remaining -- Jackson catching an eight yard scoring pass -- but Dawson County would not give the ball back, holding on for the win. \nThe Vikings jumped out to a 8-0 lead on an early safety and touchdown (a 26-yard run from Jackson) but watched Dawson County fire right back on a 51-yard bomb from Watson to Maxwell to knot the score at 8-8 on a two-point run conversion from Mitchell -- the game stayed a slugfest, as Dawson inched ahead 20-15 at the half. \nEast Hall will look to bounce back next week against West Hall.
