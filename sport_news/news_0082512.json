(Gary Wiepert | The Associated Press) Comments \nOrchard Park, N.Y. — Nigel Bradham didn't have a ton of answers for what went wrong in the Buffalo Bills' 34-21 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. Again, the defense had too many penalties, and again communication became an issue at times, but now six games into the season, Bradham isn't sure how to fix it. \nOne thing the Bills' linebacker does know, however, is that the team needs to be better at home, where it has lost each of the last three games. \n\"It's something about playing at home and getting penalties,\" Bradham said. \"I don't know if we get too fired up, or I don't know. Obviously, we've been getting a lot penalties at home, so we have to figure out what's going on with that and get that corrected. We have to win at home, man. That's our advantage. This town deserves it. We as a team deserve to win here. We should have way more wins here.\" \n» Observations | Recap \nAfter shutting down Andrew Luck in Week 1 and holding the Colts to 14 points, the Bills have allowed 98 points combined in their last three home games. \n\"That's crazy,\" Bradham said. \"Today we gave up 30-something. I didn't even look no more after they got to a point. We have to get it right, man. I don't know what's going on. We have to figure out something.\" \nOn Sunday, the Bengals were consistently starting drives near midfield. Despite keeping Bengals star receiver A.J. Green in check, the Bills still allowed Andy Dalton to toss three touchdowns and no interception. The Bengals also converted on seven of their 12 third-down attempts, while the Bills committed eight penalties for 93 yards. That brings the season total at home to 50. \n\"We're putting ourselves in bad situations,\" Bradham said. \"Bad situations. It's been in home games. We have to figure out what's going on, why we get so many penalties at home. On the road, we're fine. We have to figure it out. We have to figure something out, because you have to protect the house, you know?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:59:47.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
