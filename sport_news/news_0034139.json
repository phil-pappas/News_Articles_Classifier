The sequence began with Rick Nash harassing Blake Wheeler into an offensive zone turnover. Nash dumped it to Derick Brassard, who quickly found an uncovered Zuccarello. \nThe advantage lasted for all of 46 seconds. \nEhlers tied the game 1-1 with a power play strike from above the right faceoff circle. \nStuart's empty netter at 17:56 ended the scoring. \nNOTES: Winnipeg scratched defensemen Paul Postma and Ben Chiarot, and right wing Anthony Peluso. New York scratched right wings Jesper Fast and Emerson Etem, and defenseman Dan Boyle. The only Ranger not to play in the first four games of the season is Etem, who was acquired in a draft day trade from Anaheim. \"I would say we're going to look for an opportunity to put him in the lineup,\" New York coach Alain Vigneault said during his pregame press conference. \"I'm not exactly sure when that's going to be.\" ... Vigneault noted defenseman Kevin Klein would get to play on New York's man advantage units. \"(He's) got a good shot, a heavy shot,\" Vigneault said, before joking, \"I'm not the smartest guy in the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:53:52.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
