All three seasons will run for six weeks, ending on Nov. 28. The daily bag limits are two pheasant, three grouse and four quail. Possession limits are double the daily limit with the season limit being six pheasant, 15 grouse and 20 quail. While pheasant and grouse hunting is open statewide, quail hunting is open only in Zones 11–14. When choosing a proper load for your scattergun, consider that rooster pheasants are big and tough. They’re fast-flying birds that most often require high-velocity shells loaded with shot sizes Nos. 5 and 6. Quail are much smaller so light field loads in shot sizes No. 7 ½ or 8 that deliver a dense pattern work well. Grouse are in-between sized birds so Nos. 6 and 7 ½ will do fine. The choke you use will depend on the cover you’re hunting. Improved cylinder is an open choke that delivers its most effective pattern at close range therefore it’s best in thick cover. A full choke has a much greater constriction in the muzzle, therefore throwing much tighter patterns at longer ranges, and is best for long shots in open country. The modified choke, which is between full and improved cylinder is the standard all-around choke. For the average hunter, any shotgun in either 12, 16 or 20 gauge with the proper load and choke will drop upland birds quickly and cleanly. The smaller 28- and .410-gauge guns, while gaining popularity because of their slim lines and light weight, are disadvantaged because of the much smaller shot charge, so in my opinion are best left to the experts. The wearing of a hunter orange cap is required during the pheasant and quail season on public hunting areas or Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) where pheasant or quail are stocked. On open hunting lands, hunting is permitted from a half-hour before sunrise to a half-hour after sunset, but hunting is permitted only from sunrise to sunset on WMAs. Over the past 15 years MassWildlife has annually stocked an average of 40,000 pheasants statewide. Of those, 8,000 are stocked in our Southeast District, 4,000 in the Western District, 10,000 in the Connecticut Valley District, 13,000 in the Central District, 5,000 in the Northeast District. The appropriations are based on Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) and appropriate stocking habitat availability. All 40,000 pheasants stocked for recreational hunting in Massachusetts are paid for entirely by licensed sportsmen and women. Popular WMAs in the Southeast District that are stocked with pheasants include: Freetown State Forest, Freetown/Fall River; Noquochoke WMA, Dartmouth; Myles Standish State Forest - Carver/Plymouth; Erwin Wilder WMA, Norton/Taunton; Frances Crane WMA, Falmouth; and Marconi WMA (Cape Cod National Seashore), Welfleet. In addition to pheasants, quail are also stocked at Myles Standish and Crane. For a complete list of stocked areas on public hunting land, visit the hunting section at http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dfw/hunting-fishing-wildlife-watching/hunting/pheasant-stocking-southeast-dist.html Cottontail rabbit season also opened Saturday in Zones 1 – 12 and runs to Feb. 29 (Leap Year). In Zones 13 and 14, the season runs from Nov. 16 – Feb. 29. Snowshoe hare seasons are: Zones 1 – 4 from Oct. 17 – Feb. 29; Zones 5 – 12 from Oct. 17 – Feb. 5; and Zones 13 and 14 – Nov. 16 – Feb. 5. The daily bag is five cottontails and two hare. The standard shot size for cottontails is No. 6, while the larger and tougher hare often require Nos. 4 or 5. Coyote season opened Saturday and will close March 7 with no daily or seasonal bag limit. Fox season runs Nov. 1 to Feb. 29, also with no daily or seasonal bag limit. Hunting hours for fox and coyote end at midnight but the use of artificial lights is prohibited. Gray squirrels may be hunted from Sept. 14 to Jan. 2 in Zones 1-9 and from Oct. 17 to Jan. 2 in Zones 10-14. Rifles and handguns are legal to use on squirrels in Zones 1–9, but are prohibited in Zones 10–14. The daily bag is five. The fall season for wild turkey opens tomorrow (Oct. 19) and runs for two weeks in Zones 1–13, ending on Oct. 31. There is no turkey hunting in Zone 14. The bag limit is one turkey of either sex in the fall if you have harvested only one turkey in the spring. If you have harvested two turkeys in the spring, you may not take one in the fall. If you did not harvest a turkey in the spring, you still only may take one in the fall. Legal shot sizes are No. 4 through No. 7. The bow season for deer also opens tomorrow and runs for six weeks, closing on Nov. 28. Shotgun season for deer runs Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, followed by the muzzleloader season from Dec. 14–31. MassWildlife offers a few safety reminders to add to your enjoyment during a day in the field. Know your limits. Don't take off on a long hike, hunt, or bike ride if you're not physically ready. Tell someone where you're going and when you expect to return. Watch and respect the weather. New England weather is notorious for quick changes. Be ready with an extra layer of clothing, warm hat and gloves. Canoeists and kayakers are required to wear life jackets from September 15 to May 15, but all water enthusiasts, especially anglers who wade into larger rivers, would be wise to wear floatation devices now that water and air temperatures are cool. Expect the unexpected. No one expects problems while spending a day outdoors, but being ready with a few first aid items, matches, water, pocket knife, cell phone, map, compass, whistle, extra food, and flashlight can help prevent small problems from becoming big ones. Wear blaze orange for visibility. Whether you're a hunter, hiker, or dog walker in rural areas, it's a good idea to wear a highly visible blaze orange a cap or vest while you're enjoying the great outdoors. Respect other outdoor users. Mountain biking, horseback riding, wildlife watching, hunting, and hiking are not mutually exclusive activities. Know the hunting seasons and who is likely to be sharing the woods and waters with you. Keep dogs under control and respect outdoor users' rights to enjoy our open spaces. Sportsmen and women are reminded to take the basics of hunter safety to heart. Treat every firearm as it were loaded, keeping the muzzle pointed in a safe direction at all times. And positively identify your target and what lies beyond it. MassWildlife also reports that a new, more user-friendly interface now makes it easier to report a harvest online using a mobile device (smart phones, tablets, etc.). Reports may still be made online using a desktop computer. To report a harvest online using a computer or mobile device, visit MassFishHunt. Hunters also may continue to report a harvest in person at a traditional check station. In Southeastern Mass., check stations include the Freetown State Forest, Village Sports in Westport, Reedy’s Archery Shop in Middleboro and the MassWildlife Southeast District Office in Bourne. For check station operating hours and a complete map of statewide check station locations, visit http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dfw/hunting-fishing-wildlife-watching/hunting/checkstation-map.html Online checking/harvest reporting for deer is not available during the shotgun season (Nov. 30 – Dec. 12). Deer must be brought to a traditional check station during that time to allow MassWildlife staff to collect biological information to help determine deer management decisions. Bears and coyotes may still be reported online during the shotgun season, however those hunters who harvest bears are urged to check them at a check station so biological information can also be gathered from those animals. NOAA seeks public input on recreational fishing NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) reports that it’s taking an important step in the management of saltwater recreational fisheries with the development of a Greater Atlantic Region Recreational Fisheries Implementation Plan. And NOAA is looking for public input in developing a plan that addresses the issues of greatest concern to the recreational angler. This will involve the fullest range of recreational fishing interests throughout the Greater Atlantic Region. For example: what activities or services would you like to see expanded? What activities or services have you found to be unnecessary? Can you recommend approaches for improving our communication with the recreational fishing community? What else do you wish we would do to support sustainable recreational opportunities? While forming your comments, consider the national policy’s guiding principles: support ecosystem conservation and enhancement; promote public access to quality recreational fishing opportunities; coordinate with state and federal management entities; advance innovative solutions to evolving science, management, and environmental challenges; provide scientifically sound and trusted social, cultural, economic, and ecological information; and communicate and engage with the recreational fishing public. To submit comments, include the recreational fisheries in which you participate and send them to nmfs.gar.recreational.fishing @noaa.gov. The deadline is Oct. 26.
