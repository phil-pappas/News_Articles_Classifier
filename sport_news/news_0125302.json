Mane put Southampton 2-1 up in the 60th minute after turning John Terry and squeezing a shot past Asmir Begovic and then teed up Graziano Pelle for the visitors' third goal 12 minutes later.\nODION IGHALO (Watford)\nIghalo scored his fifth goal of the season to earn Watford a 1-1 draw at fellow promoted side Bournemouth. The Nigeria striker found the net on the stroke of half-time after a howler by Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc, who passed the ball straight to him. Ighalo coolly rounded the Poland international and rolled the ball into the empty net.\nYANNICK BOLASIE (Crystal Palace)\nDemocratic Republic of Congo winger Bolasie got on the score-sheet at Selhurst Park for the first time since New Year's Day 2013 to set Palace on their way to a 2-0 defeat of West Bromwich Albion. Bolasie made the breakthrough in the 68th minute, flying in at the back post to meet Yohan Cabaye's inviting left-wing cross with an emphatic close-range header.\nJEFF SCHLUPP (Leicester City)\nGhana international Schlupp was moved forward into a midfield role by Claudio Ranieri for Leicester's trip to Norwich City and rewarded his manager with what proved to be the decisive goal in a 2-1 win. Schlupp exchanged passes with N'Golo Kante before steadying himself and firing a low, left-foot shot past John Ruddy.\nANDRE AYEW (Swansea City)\nAyew scored his fourth Swansea goal in his side's 2-2 draw at home to Tottenham Hotspur. The tenacious midfielder, son of Ghana great Abedi Pele, opened the scoring in the 16th minute at the Liberty Stadium with a header from Jefferson Montero's left-wing cross.\nSPAIN\nFAYCAL FAJR (Deportivo la Coruna)\nMoroccan midfielder Fajr scored his second goal of the season as Deportivo moved up to sixth with a 1-1 draw at Granada.\nNABIL GHILAS (Levante)\nAlgerian international Ghilas provided the perfect cross for Deyverson to score the only goal of the game as Levante secured their first win of the season against leaders Villarreal.\nITALY\nMOHAMED SALAH (Roma)\nSalah's recent purple patch has been great for Roma and the Egyptian's threat in attack led to a Palermo counter-offensive to stop him, only for the Sicilians to concede a 4-2 defeat at home to the Giallorossi. Salah found less space and fewer opportunities than usual.\nGERVINHO (Roma)\nGervinho recently ended his quest for a first league goal since November 2014 and the Ivorian, who is playing like he has been given an ultimatum by club bosses, continued his purple patch with a brace that included a superb curling effort just before the half hour that saw him hold off his marker before beating Stefano Sorrentino at the keeper's top right corner. Gervinho made the result safe after Palermo had fought their way back to 3-2 at the death with his second goal.\nKWADWO ASAMOAH (Juventus)\nAsamoah's opportunities under Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri have been few and far between due to a combination of injury and falling down the pecking order following Antonio Conte’s departure at the end of the 2014 season. The Ghanaian made his long-awaited return as the champions defeated Bologna 3-1 to secure their first home win of the season, at the fourth attempt, to finally turn the corner. It was only a cameo appearance -- Asamoah replaced Sami Khedira for the final two minutes of the game -- but it suggested the Ghanaian may still feature in Allegri's plans.\nFRANCE\nZARGO TOURE (Lorient)\nLorient’s new signing from Ligue 2 outfit Le Havre opened his goal scoring account in fine fashion as he banged home a 79th-minute winner for the Brittany side in a 3-2 victory over Bordeaux. It was Toure’s first goal in over two years and broke his Ligue 1 duck.\nSOFIANE BOUFAL (Lille)\nParisian-born Moroccan midfielder Boufal opened the scoring for Lille, from the penalty spot, as the northerners went on to win their second match of the season 2-0 over struggling Montpellier. Former Zambia and Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard, who won the African championship with both nations, welcomed the home win as Lille moved up the Ligue 1 table to 12th despite scoring just four goals in nine matches.\nGERMANY\nSALOMON KALOU (Hertha Berlin)\nThe Ivory Coast striker gave Hertha the lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium when he struck his third goal of the season after 17 minutes as their 3-0 win over Hamburg left them fourth.\nSALIF SANE (Hanover 96)\nThe Senegal defensive midfielder helped Hanover climb off the bottom of the Bundesliga table as his second-half header sealed their 1-0 win at home to Werder Bremen.\nPIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG (Borussia Dortmund)\nThe Gabon winger continued his record run of having scored in each of this season's eight games as he netted in Dortmund's 5-1 trouncing at Bayern Munich in a top-of-the-table clash. Aubamenyang, who has 10 goals in eight league games, slotted home Gonzalo Castro's cross on 36 minutes to make it 2-1 to Bayern before the league leaders pulled away.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:22:35.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
