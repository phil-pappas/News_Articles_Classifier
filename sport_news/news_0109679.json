(AP) - A settlement from BP and a refund from Mississippi Power came at just the right time for the Coast Coliseum Commission to buy 8 acres of land, possibly for a hotel or other development.\nThe offer for the former Holiday Inn site on U.S. 90 was made before Tuesday's scheduled auction of the property.\nMatt McDonnell, executive director of the Coast Coliseum and Convention Center, told The Sun Herald Tuesday ( http://bit.ly/1ZWDy9V ) says the Coliseum Commission received about $400,000 from BP in an oil-spill settlement.\nHe says the commission expects to receive about the same amount in a refund Mississippi Power was directed to return to customers who were billed for construction of the Kemper County energy plant.\nInformation from: The Sun Herald, http://www.sunherald.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
