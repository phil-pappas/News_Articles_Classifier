Stepping onto the field with Neymar and swapping shirts with Robinho after the United States’ 4–1 loss to Brazil earlier this month was just the latest stop on his surreal ride since a first national team call-up in September 2014.\n“Playing on the same field as some of those guys was definitely a super cool experience,” he told SI.com over the phone on Tuesday. “It’s been a crazy last few months, but it’s been exciting. A lot of dreams coming true, so it’s been awesome.”\nAfter joining the senior team for the Brazil match on Sept. 8, Morris is in Kansas City, Kansas, this week with the U.S. Under-23 team for the start of CONCACAF Olympic qualifying. The Americans have failed to qualify for two of the last three quadrennial events and didn’t even make it out of the group stage four years ago after a loss to Canada and draw with El Salvador.\nThe pressure is on, but Morris said he and his teammates–rising stars like Gedion Zelalem, Emerson Hyndman, Wil Trapp among them–aren’t overly troubled by it.\n“Obviously, we’re a different team coming in than last cycle,” he said. “Those guys got a little unlucky, but I don’t think we’re trying to think too much about the pressure.”\nPlanet Futbol Morris, Zelalem, Hyndman headline USA's Olympic qualifying squad by Liviu Bird", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/liviubird", "http://twitter.com/liviubird"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:10:23.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
