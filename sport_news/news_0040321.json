The Gunners demolished United with some brilliant passing football, taking the lead when Alexis Sanchez scored with a clever near-post flick after six minutes. They doubled their lead a minute later when Mesut Ozil rifled in from 12 metres and completed the rout when Sanchez blasted in an unstoppable shot for his sixth goal in his last three games after 19 minutes. The victory was Arsenal’s biggest against United for 17 years and lifted them to 16 points, two behind leaders Manchester City, and ahead of United on goal difference. Everton and Liverpool drew 1-1 in one of the quieter Merseyside derbies of recent years. Liverpool, who have not lost to their neighbours for five years, went ahead in the 42nd minute when Danny Ings was left unmarked to head in a corner. But in added time at the end of the first half, Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku drove in the equaliser. Chelsea’s early season slump turned into a full-blown crisis on Saturday when they were beaten 3-1 by Southampton. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:25:05.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
