So, of course, it was his home run that helped send the Bombers back to the playoffs for the first time since 2012.\nBeltran’s second-inning solo shot paved the way for a 4-1 win over Boston at rainy Yankee Stadium. At 38, the Yankees’ grand old man showed again he’s still more grand than old — and his usual threat in October.\n“We want to win. When you play playoff games, it’s about winning,’’ Beltran said in a champagne-drenched clubhouse.\n“After everything we’ve gone through as a team, being able to [have] made it to the wild-card game is special. I know it’s one game, and everything could go either way, but we’re positive [about] our team. A lot of people counted us out early in the year, so to be in this position really means a lot to us.’’\nA lot to Beltran, too, who was counted out himself earlier this year as too old. Hitting .162 with no homers and just seven RBIs as Rodriguez and Teixeira carried the team through April, he has hit cleanup and carried the load as the duo have been ineffective and injured.\n“We signed him for a reason: because he can still play,’’ general manager Brian Cashman told The Post. “We gave him a three-year deal despite his age, because he’s really good. He’s certainly leading us here down the stretch.’’\nThat’s an understatement. Beltran is hot after an August adjustment to his stance shifted more weight to his back leg. Since the All-Star break, he’s second on the team in both homers (12) and RBIs (36), and padded those numbers Thursday.\nAgainst Boston starter Rich Hill, who came in with a 1.17 ERA, Beltran worked a full count and tagged a 91 mph fastball to right-center for his 19th home run. Nine of those have been go-ahead homers, and his last four have broken ties.\n“Baseball is a long season, man,” Beltran told The Post. “You cannot judge one season in one month. You’ve got to play the whole year, 162 games. I’ve always been a player that I’m very patient, I’m very calm, and I believe in what I’m capable of doing. If I’m healthy, I’m going to perform.’’\nThe back of Beltran’s baseball card says he’ll perform again in the playoffs, where he has hit .333 with 16 home runs in 51 games. He’s among the top six active players in postseason homers, hits and RBIs.\n“We’re talking about Carlos Beltran,’’ said Greg Bird, who put Beltran in the same age-defying class as Rodriguez. “When people count them out, I don’t know if it motivates them or gets them going, but they get the job done. … I’ll definitely take them on my side rather than on the other side.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under carlos beltran ,  joe girardi ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:35:19.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
