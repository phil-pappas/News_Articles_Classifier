Joseph DeJoice knotted the score at two when Carson Steiner assisted him with 18:26 left in regulation. \nThe score stayed tied through the rest of the second half and the first overtime period until Harrison Ewing recorded an unassisted goal with 2:59 remaining in the second OT. \n“At halftime we talked to the kids and said that even though we were down by two we were still the better team,” said BW coach Joe Rowan. “We said let’s get one goal in the first 15 minutes, another in the second 15 and then one at the end or the win. It pretty much played to script until OT when we had our chances, but were denied on some nice stops by Goretti’s goalie.” \nJames Searcy and Ewing spotted the Gaels to a 2-0 lead at halftime on assists from Reed Martz and Miles Roper. \nBishop Walsh, which finishes 10-7-2, led in shots 18-17 and corner kicks, 4-2. Spartans goalie Angelo Contaldi had 13 saves, and Jaelin Farrell made 12 for St. Maria Goretti. \n“It was a heartbreaking loss,” said Rowan. “To fall behind like we did, and then come back only to lose in overtime was very emotional. You feel for the kids because they played good enough to be state champs. It just didn’t happen.” \nThe 3-2 loss means that six of Bishop Walsh’s seven losses came in games decided by one goal. Eleven of the Spartans’ 19 games were decided by one goal, with BW going 5-6 in those 11. \nThe Spartans beat St. John’s earlier Sunday in the semifinals by a score of 2-1. Steiner scored both goals with the first going unassisted and the second being assisted by DeJoice. \nBishop Walsh led 23-14 in shot taken, and 4-2 in corner kicks. Contaldi had nine saves in the win. \nBryce Martin got an unassisted goal for St. John’s while Noah Austin had 14 saves.
