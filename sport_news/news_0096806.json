Beginning next season, the contract renewal is a seven-year agreement that allows Duke to play up to 36 exhibition and home games at the stadium each year. The agreement also calls for a limited number of Duke practices at the facility as well as a new permanent Duke locker room and clubhouse at the facility. Duke and the Durham Bulls began their partnership prior to the Blue Devils’ 2010 season. The 2016 campaign marks the seventh consecutive season in which Duke will play homes games at the stadium. Under the new agreement, the Blue Devils will play the vast majority of their home schedule at the minor-league venue. Duke plays other games on campus at Coombs Field.
