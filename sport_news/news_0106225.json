Pedro and Remy didn’t travel cause of injuries and Jose didn’t want to risk them. Eden Hazard came in place of Pedro. Nemanja Matic, who came on at half-time on Saturday, started in the middle and Gary Cahill was back in central defence, with Kurt Zouma moving out to right-back. Cesar Azpilicueta was back on the left. \nIt was the wingers Eden Hazard and Willian who came closest to breaking the deadlock and both had influential games. The team as a whole produced a coherent display and Asmir Begovic was only called upon to make a couple of difficult saves. \nPorto’s home win over Maccabi Tel Aviv places them top of the group with seven points at the halfway stage, with Dynamo Kiev on five points and Chelsea on four. \nFirst Half \nAn early slip from Dynamo Kiev centre-back Aleksandar Dragovic had more to do with pressing from the Chelsea attackers than it did the wet pitch(it rained in the UEFA Youth league earlier during the day where Chelsea U-19 beat Dynamo Kiev 0-2), and a cute Matic backheel under pressure to find Hazard in space were good early signs for the Blues. Hazard was then gifted the ball by Sergey Sydorchuk but could not find Diego Costa with his pass. \nDynamo boss Sergei Rebrov had made five changes following a home hammering by Shakhtar in their most recent outing, but the former Spurs and West Ham striker’s side had been second best in the opening 10 minutes. Vitaliy Buyalskily, one of the players brought back in, was the first to test Asmir Begovic but it was a comfortable save. \nWith just over quarter-of-an hour gone, Chelsea were denied a penalty after their best move of the game so far. It involved Hazard, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas and ended with Fabregas bundled over by two Dynamo players who did not make contact with the ball. Fabregas and Jose were certain that Chelsea should have been awarded a penalty but the referee denied them. \nOn 26 minutes came the home side’s best effort yet and Begovic’s best save, diving to get his hand to a thumping shot after Derlis Gonzalez surged inside and let fly. \nAt the other end, Chelsea kept the pressure on Kiev and the home side were fortunate when Willian’s corner(one of his trademark free-kicks at the moment) went all way across the goal without a touch by anyone. Chelsea were finding space easy to come by in the middle of the park and the next corner was looped over high by Fabregas. The keeper saved under the bar from Cahill’s header. \nAs the teams went down the tunnel at half-time, it was only a lack of a goal so far that prevented this from being a textbook Champions League away performance. \nDynamo Kiev 0-0 Chelsea (half-time): \nShots: 4-8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:15:57.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
