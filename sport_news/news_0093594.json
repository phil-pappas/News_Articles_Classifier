Zeke the Streak. Routgers.\nPregame buzz: News that J.T. Barrett would be making his first start of the season gave the Rutgers game an almost “season opener” feel to it. It’s not often a fresh start comes on the heels of a 7-0 start, but this was it.\nWorth the road trip? In the shadow of the Big Apple sits Piscataway, where the first college football game was played in 1869 (Rutgers defeated Princeton 6-4). So history-loving fans could dig their teeth into antiquity even as they were digging their chompers into New Yawk pizza and some of the best deli food in the world.\nOne-liner: College football was born at Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights nearly died there on Saturday night, too.\nJust wondering: Will college football ever be a big-enough deal in the Land of Lady Liberty, where pro football is king? The atmosphere in High Point Solutions Stadium was something you’d find on fall Friday nights in Ohio. No, wait, even high-school football in the Buckeye State is more energized than this. You would think being so close to New York would mean Rutgers would have can’t-miss fan support.\nThe view How the team sees it: Hear that smooth humming sound. It’s not your refrigerator. It’s us.\nHow the pollsters will see it: Buckeyes made the team from outside New York look like New Yuck. Impressive.\nHow Buckeye Nation will see it: You know it’s a good night when Rutgers’ best tacklers are Ohio State receivers.\nUrban dictionary What he said: “The most complete defensive performance.”\nWhat it means: “Even after letting Rutgers wriggle off the hook at the end.”\nIf this were an HBO mafia show The Sopran-osu’s . In this episode, the Don (played by Urban Meyer), tells his guys to eliminate Rutgers by “outfitting” them in cement cleats.\nThey said it Your turn/the channel: Viewers noted ABC’s A-team of Kirk Herbstreit and Chris Fowler were rolling along until the name game got away from them late, when Fowler kept saying “Bell” for OSU running back Warren Ball. Viewers also did not appreciate Fowler’s FBI investigation of Zeke Elliott’s first-down run that set up the Buckeyes’ first touchdown. Oh, and viewer Susan Fargus noted how “Herbie is getting a head start on no-shave November.”\nNumbers for dummies 28: consecutive Big Ten wins for the Buckeyes, one shy of the national record for consecutive conference wins (Florida State won 29 from 1992-95 in the Atlantic Coast Conference).\n150: Career wins for Meyer\n78: reporters who were sorely disappointed to learn that a report of pumpkin pie being available at halftime was in fact an evil lie.\nOn tap Bye-bye Buckeyes for the week. Next up: Minnesota on Nov. 7.\nTweethearts Best responses to @rollerCD on Twitter :\n@BuckeyeWalsh: Champs like us, baby we were born to run. Apologies to @springsteen.\n@BrewdoodCMH: let’s hope second half is less Jersey Snore\n@BuckMichigan: the good kind of calling for the backup QB — calling for it after a big lead to protect the starter... :)\n@DanHickey2020: Rutgers renames home Low Point Stadium.\n@TheCincyBuckeye: Is Rutgers wearing next year’s Buckeye alternate uni?\n@MattTwombly1: I think they call that last play the quarterback Snooki\n@BlessedByTwins: It’s nice to be able to breathe again when the #Buckeyes throw the ball!\n@Buckeyes1117: J.T. will get credit for how well the defense played, too. #LoyaltoCardale\n@sylvaniaperl: Good move Urban. Dark Night or Scarlet Knight, J.T. is right. Get ready for a November to Remember.\nHorseshoe haiku QB switcheroo \nBarrett bringing the thunder \nagainst Scarlet Nots \nroller@dispatch.com \n@rollerCD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:16:06.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
