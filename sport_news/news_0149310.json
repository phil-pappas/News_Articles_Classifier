He's not less mobile than Nick Foles but he's much less interested in running. That only makes sense, given his injury history, but I'm starting to think it matters a lot. He ran it one time the other game and that's not enough. \nDave: I think that's overrated. The other team knows where to go not to be blocked. \nRich: I think a lot of it is talent at this point. \nDave: Jason Peters has clearly been hurt the whole time. Lane Johnson hasn't been good. But historically bad? I looked at Jason Kelce in the locker room on Sunday and I felt bad for him. He's a guy who clearly wants to get this thing fixed, and it isn't, and he's taking the blame, and I was looking at him and thinking, \"I don't think it's your fault, my man.\" What is a coach there for if not to put people in a better position when they're confronted with this kind of situation. I'm more convinced than ever that this is a scheme thing. You're starting to hear people say it. Mark Schlereth . . . \nRich: Of course they're going to say it. They all hate him. But riddle me this, Bruce Arians: why can the quarterback go through stretches of games and look good and through other long stretches of games where he just looks scared to do anything? That's not scheme. I mean, what happened in the second half against Washington? \nDave: I don't know. I will say this: Sam Bradford did not make a heckuva lot of bad plays the other day. He played a very good game. \nRich: But why can't you acknowledge that if the quarterback had been more consistent this year, game to game, then things would be a lot better? \nDave: They would be. \nRich: That's not scheme, then. It's quarterback play. This guy descends to the depths for about 15 minutes a game, every game. \nDave: Of course he does. He's Sam Bradford. \nRich: So I'll say it again - that's not a scheme problem. \nDave: If they traded for him thinking he was going to win games by himself, that was a poor move. But here's what I'm saying: we can nitpick everything. But the beauty of having one guy in charge of coaching and personnel is that, whatever we nitpick, it's his fault. And to me, either he has the wrong players for the scheme or the scheme doesn't work anymore. If you can't line up and get two yards . . . \nRich: Dammit! \nDave: Yes, dammit! If you can't line up and put two back in the backfield, or two tight ends, and get two yards when you need it, what are you? You need to play that way sometimes for time of possession, you should excuse the expression. \nRich: To be fair, he has shown that he'll play that way at the end of games sometimes. \nDave: He didn't do it the other day. \nRich: He probably thought he needed more points. Turns out, he did. \nDave: Here's your assignment. You have NFL Rewind, right? \nRich: Doesn't everybody? \nDave: I highly recommend it. That and DraftKings. It's this new thing. You might have heard of it. \nRich: Promo code: IT'S THE SCHEME. \nDave: Look at a team like the Bills. Their offense is very simple, but it makes a lot of sense. They don't have the most talent so they keep it simple, slow, methodical. Chip won't do it. His problem is he always wants five guys out in the pattern, trying to get open. But I'm going off on digressions that I could write 1,000 words about each. \nRich: You never digress. \nDave: He figures, I have five guys going out and they have five guys covering them and that maximizes things. But if you have three guys going out, two blocking, and the quarterback has more time - that, to me, might be better. But you need guys who can get open. This offense was better when they had guys who could get open and a healthy offensive line and a running back (LeSean McCoy) who could make something out of nothing. They don't have any of that right now. So you have to adjust your game plan. But Chip is talking like a loser. He's talking like a coach who gets fired because he refuses to change. He sounds like Josh McDaniels right now. \nRich: First of all, he's not going to tell you what he's going to do. I mean, he's not going to tell you what day it is. But you need to fairly acknowledge what happened in that game. The offensive line was an injured mess and it affected things, and it was understandable. And if it continues in this state, there just isn't any way they'll be able to run the ball consistently, whatever the scheme. So this is about Bradford. \nDave: He needs more time because Nelson Agholor and Jordan Matthews need more time to get open. That's the adjustment. But Bradford - it looks like somebody came up to him at halftime and said, \"Dude, they're not going to get any more open than they're getting right now, so start throwing it.\" That's what it looked like to me. \nRich: Agholor showed up. That was different. I think he might be OK \nDave: I kind of like him, too. He could be good. But right now, he looks like a college kid going against NFL players. He's thin, he's wispy, he's great after the catch. But Jeremy Maclin was a guy who was a great route runner and big enough that he put himself between the defender and the ball. They miss that. \nRich: Here's something we can agree on: the NFL needs to be petitioned and this rule needs to be changed - other than requiring five guys to wear lineman's numbers, there should be no illegal formations. Why does that even exist? It's crazy that it cost them a touchdown. \nDave: It's so funny. We talk about all this crap, and they're a penalty and a couple of missed kicks way from being 3-1. It's a weird year in the NFL. Tons of penalties. Stuff happens. And the state of kicking in the NFL really is not good, even though it's so much better than it used to be. \nRich: But they're all stressing out so much on the long extra points that it's affecting their field goals. I still can't figure out what the NFL was trying to accomplish with all of this. Because all they've done is turn the kickers into basket cases. \nDave: Enough of the kickers. I used to hate Phillies fans. When things went bad, you'd start getting the \"Jimmy isn't hustling to first base\" stuff, and the \"Cole Hamels isn't a true ace\" stuff. That's where the Eagles are - you can nitpick anything at this point. That's what happens when things go bad. It's just distracts you from what's important . . . \nRich: Promo code: IT'S THE SCHEME. \nDave: Look, I respect the man and his mind. But I hate the offense. It's an abomination. It's terrible to watch. And it's not working now. I refuse to believe that all of these guys up front have gotten this bad. Thirty-five percent of their plays go for no yardage of backwards. That's not possible. But you could take five guys from our sports department and put them in front of one of these running backs and they would gain two yards. \nRich: Who do you think the Daily News' best blocker is? I think Domo. \nDave: Domo would kill it. He might play dirty but he would get it done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:11:23.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
