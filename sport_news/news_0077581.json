I don't think there is another word to describe the feeling right now. We're in a very, very dark place after that game. \n\"That's understandable because of how well we played. In my opinion we should have won and that's what makes it so disappointing. \n\"It was hard looking at the faces of some of the guys who have been in the team for a while. It means so much to them. \n\"You never want to think your work is done during a match but when Mark scored that was definitely the position we wanted to be in. \n\"A lot of people didn't give us a chance but we came so close to doing it.\" \nFoley's match-winning kick came in highly contentious circumstances. \nA botched Scottish line-out saw the ball knocked forward and it ended up in the hands of offside Scottish forward Jon Welsh - but replays indicated a touch in between from Australia's Nick Phipps, meaning a scrum rather than a penalty may have been sufficient. \nSouth Africa-born Strauss was in amongst the ruck of bodies challenging for the ball but insists he played no part in the drama. \n\"The ball never touched me but even if it had hit my shoulder, that's not a knock on,\" he stressed. \"I don't make those calls so I don't know what to say (about the referee). We were obviously disappointed out on the pitch. \n\"In my view it was a ball that went backwards but it's not my view that matters unfortunately. \n\"When we kicked off again we were just fighting to get the ball back. Unfortunately we couldn't do it.\" \nScotland's form during the tournament could hardly have been different to this year's RBS 6 Nations, where they finished last after a humiliating whitewash of defeats. \nBut now Strauss reckons Cotter's swashbuckling side have the talent to win the tournament when they resume action next year. \n\"It's important that we build on this,\" he said. \"It's been a disappointing time for Scottish rugby over the last couple of years if you look at results. \n\"But we can hold our heads high after this competition. We have proved what we are about as a team. \n\"It doesn't always go your way but the fight to stay in the match there proved our character and we have to build on it. \n\"There is great young talent coming through and hopefully that will snowball into the Six Nations. \n\"You want the belief you are going to win every competition you enter and that belief is there in this group. \n\"Winning is infectious and the better you play the more confidence you build. We have to keep that somehow.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:19:41.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
