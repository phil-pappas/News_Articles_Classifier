Show Caption Previous Next \nFarragut High School's volleyball team did enough to clinch a Region 2-AAA berth on Wednesday, edging rival Bearden 22-25, 26-24, 25-21, 25-16 in the District 4-AAA tournament. \nThe host Lady Admirals, who finished as Class AAA state runners-up in 2014, advance to Thursday's 6:30 p.m. championship match, and will take on the winner of a 5 p.m. elimination semifinal game between Bearden and Hardin Valley. \nThe Region 2-AAA tournament is set for Tuesday at Anderson County. \n\"Bearden came out really sharp,\" Farragut coach Susan Davidson said by phone on Wednesday. \"We were missing some of our cues, then we started putting ourself together. ... We started mixing our attacks better than we did in the first set.\" \nFarragut is chasing its first district tournament title since 2012. \nFarragut junior Alexis Parker helped give the Lady Admirals a chance to accomplish that with 24 kills, four blocks and seven digs. Freshman Sydney Cherney added eight kills, 14 assists and five aces and junior Madi Howell, a Clemson commitment, posted 12 digs, 10 kills, three blocks and three aces. Senior Tia Madden had 17 assists, 10 points and six digs. \nLogan Kael led Bearden with 40 digs, and Chesney McClellan posted 19 kills, six blocks and 12 digs. \nHardin Valley def. Heritage 16-25, 25-27, 25-23, 25-17, 15-10: Kailey Keeble posted 21 kills, 20 digs and 17 assists, Madison Wilkerson had 16 kills and 22 assists and Savannah Bradburn added 24 digs, but it wasn't enough for Heritage to fend off elimination. \nDistrict 2-AAA \nMorristown West def. Morristown East 25-21, 25-18, 25-22: A balanced effort helped Morristown West clinch a Region 1-AAA berth and advance to Thursday's championship match against either Seymour or Morristown East. \nJasmine Williams posted 10 kills and four blocks, Kaley Muncy had nine kills, four aces and 10 service points, Blayke Shultz had 18 digs and Claire McDonald chipped in 17 assists as the Lady Trojans won in straight sets. \nShould Morristown West lose on Thursday, a second championship match is scheduled for noon Saturday to determine a victor. \nSeymour edged Jefferson County 25-21, 25-17, 25-27, 20-25, 16-14 to advance.
