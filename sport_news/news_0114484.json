A swift counter-attack saw Hayes and McGinn exchange passes, before the former sent his angled drive high and wide.It was a warning not heeded by the visitors, and when Stephen Pearson gave away a soft free-kick after 42 minutes, the home side took the lead.Hayes and McGinn stood over the ball, and it was the latter who swung over a sweet cross. The defence and goalkeeper seemed to hesitate as the ball arced in - but Rooney was not hanging around.If the goal was at odds with the flow of the play for much of the first half, it would have been cruel had Ryan Jack's effort on the stroke of half time dipped under the crossbar rather than flown over.The Steelmen suffered another blow just eight minutes after the restart as Lasley was forced off with an ankle injury, to be replaced by Lionel Ainsworth.They could have found themselves further behind just moments later as McGinn worked an opening to cross for Rooney - but his header was just over the bar.And the visitors had another narrow escape just before the hour mark as Hayes and Rooney combined, the striker feeding McGinn whose miscue was almost turned in by Peter Pawlett, only for the ball to dribble wide of target.Aberdeen did have the ball in the net again when Mark Reynolds turned home a free kick from close range, but his effort was ruled out by an offside call from assistant referee Kylie McMullan.And the home side were dealt an injury blow of their own when Ash Taylor was forced off with a back injury he picked up in attempting a miscued clearance. Paul Quinn took his place.Motherwell would find themselves level with 73 minutes gone. Reynolds gave away a soft free-kick challenging for an aerial ball, and in what was almost a carbon copy of the first half Aberdeen goal, substitute Scott McDonald ghosted in at the back post to head home Ainsworth's cross.With five minutes remaining, Motherwell goalkeeper Connor Ripley had to be at his best to push a Logan header over after excellent work by fellow full-back Graeme Shinnie, while at the other end Ward performed similar heroics from Theo Robinson's effort.And deep into injury time, on-loan Liverpool keeper Ward made a hat-trick of excellent saves, two from Ainsworth, to keep the scoreline level.
