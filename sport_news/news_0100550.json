Pierzynski had an RBI single in the first inning one night after hitting two home runs, and Michael Bourn singled home the Braves' other run in the second. \nRookie Arodys Vizcaino earned his 10th save - and second in two nights - with a perfect ninth. This was the Braves' first shutout since beating the Mets 1-0 on June 21. Edwin Jackson and Peter Moylan pitched perfect innings out of the bullpen. \nJordan Zimmermann (13-10), a fixture in the Nationals' rotation since 2011, took the loss in what will likely be his final appearance for the team that drafted him in 2007. Zimmermann, a free agent at the end of the season, gave up two runs and six hits in six innings in his career-high 33rd start.
