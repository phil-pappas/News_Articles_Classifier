(AP) A person with knowledge of the situation says Florida quarterback Will Grier is ill and might not start against third-ranked Mississippi on Saturday. \nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Friday because the 25th-ranked Gators have not disclosed Grier's illness. \nFlorida had about a dozen players miss practice this week because of a virus, but coach Jim McElwain said Wednesday night that he thought the bug had ran its course. \nIf Grier doesn't start, sophomore Treon Harris would make his second start of the season. Harris started the opener and split series with Grier, who has started the last three games. \nGrier has thrown for 725 yards and six touchdowns this season. He also has two rushing scores and four turnovers, including three interceptions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:58:25.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
