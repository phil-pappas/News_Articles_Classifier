(AP Photo/Jay LaPrete) \nWASHINGTON — Soon after the Maryland Terrapins fell to top-ranked Ohio State 49-28 on Saturday, Terps head coach Randy Edsall grew agitated with a series of questions at his postgame press conference. \nWith multiple reports suggesting that he will soon be fired , Edsall was asked if he expects to still be coaching the team when they next play on Oct. 24. \n“I’m going to go on the bus and I’m going to watch the film,” he said. “Those are things I don’t control. All I’m going to do is get these kids to be the best they can be and develop them and keep getting them better…. I don’t make those decisions. Somebody else makes those decisions.” \nEdsall was then asked why he made a point to shake hands with each of his player’s on the field prior to Saturday’s kickoff. This was the question that put Edsall over the edge. You’ll want to see @RandyEdsall ‘s response to a reporter asking about shaking players’ hands before today’s game. http://t.co/fxBT5513wT \n— BIG 10.10 (@BigTenNetwork) October 10, 2015 \n“Have you been to any of the games since I’ve been the head coach here at the University of Maryland?” Edsall asked the reporter. “If you would notice, I do that every single game. Every single game out of the respect that I have for these kids and what they go through. Every single game.” \nEdsall then marched out of his press conference, while a handful of supporters in the back of the room applauded. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP.
