The two sides came into the match at the Emirates Stadium level on points and a win for either side would prove vital in thier bid to qualify for the knockout rounds. Sevilla in red were Europa League winners for the last two seasons and have not looked out of place in the elite competition as they go ahead on Yevhen Konoplyanka's strike in the 30th minute. 6 minutes later, Yaya Toure wiggles free from his defender and finds Raheem Sterling, whose close-range attempt is right at Sergio Rico who can't coral it and the rebound falls to Wilfried Bony and his shot deflects off Adil Rami and into the net for an own goal.It's not until the final moments of the match that a winner is finally found. With the play wide open, Kevin De Bruyne makes a run into the box and creates enough space fowire a low shot into far corner as City escape with a narrow 2-1 win. Manchester City 2 - Sevilla 1 \n\"When you win it's very important for the trust of the players, because it's always important to arrive at a game like the derby on Sunday winning and not losing with a lot of doubts. We need to continue improving what we are doing,\" said Manuel Pellegrini, Manchester City manager. Los Blancos remain on top of Group A with draw Now we've got Real Madrid at Paris St. Germain with both sides undefeated and yet to concede a goal in the competition after two rounds. Los Blancos would be playing without the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez. PSG were almost at full strength with their preferred midfield of Blaise Matuidi, Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti.The hosts impose their usual possession pattern on the game and have their first clear chance after 11 minutes when Matuidi's low shot is saved by Keylor Navas.The visitors have a great opportunity in the 25th minute, but Kevin Trapp makes a fine save foot on Jese after a brilliant through ball from Toni Kroos. The German keeper is at it again 10 minutes from the interval, tipping Cristiano Ronaldo's header over the bar as Real begin to take control. Casemiro forces Trapp into another save with a long-range shot. Real's best chance comes in the 39th minute, but neither Ronaldo or Casemiro can score.PSG are back in possession after the break and Edinson Cavani goes close when he latches on to a cross from Motta in the 49th.At the end of a sharp counter-attack, Ronaldo misses the target with a powerful angled shot. 0-0, is the final score. The result extends Real's undefeated record in group matches to 18 games to equal Barcelona's mark in 2012.Other matches saw Malmo beat Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0, PSV Eindhoven lost to Wolfsburg 2-0, CSKA Moscow drew with Manchester United 1-1, Galatasaray defeated Benfica 2-1, Atletico Madrid thrashed Astana 4-0 and Juventus drew Moenchengladbach 0-0.
