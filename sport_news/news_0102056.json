Videos Read the latest Jaguars coverage \nThe Jaguars are now down to Plan B with their receiving corps. \nBryan Walters and Tony Washington, who were both cut earlier this year, are now the team’s third and fourth receivers and Walters is the team’s slot receivers on passing downs. Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns remain the starters. \nWalters and Washington are getting a chance to make an impact because Marqise Lee hasn’t been able to overcome his hamstring injury and rookie Rashad Greene is on injured reserve list with a thumb injury and isn’t eligible to return to practice until Nov. 3. He’s eligible to play on Nov. 19 against Tennessee. \nLee is still on the active roster, but he hasn’t practiced since coming out at halftime of the New England game. He’s already been declared out for Sunday’s game at Tampa Bay, and there appears to be no timetable for his return. \nAnd that means more playing time for Walters and Washington. \n“They definitely have to step up and pick up some slack within that room,” quarterback Blake Bortles said. “They’ve done a really good job. They’re both smart guys and really good players.” \n“These guys will get opportunities,” offensive coordinator Greg Olson said. “They’re both intelligent players. Walters is a little bit more of a slot [receiver], where Tony is a bit more of an outside receiver. He gives us a little bit more of a deep ball threat. They’re both solid, dependable players.” \nWalters has taken a longer journey to get to what appears to be the best opportunity of his career as the Jaguars’ slot receiver on passing downs. \nOriginally signed as a rookie free agent by Seattle out of Cornell in 2010, he was waived early in camp on Aug. 5 that year and wasn’t signed to the practice squad until December. He’s been cut 10 times by three teams, once from the Seattle practice squad in 2013 before he was re-signed two days later. \nThe story of his career is that when a team needed a roster spot, he found himself on the waiver wire. “It’s been a crazy road,’’ he said. \nEven when he was Seattle’s punt returner last year, he was cut for three days in November. \nAnd when the Jaguars brought up Peyton Thompson from the practice squad on Sept. 19 because they needed an extra defensive back, Walters was cut. He was back three days later because Greene was injured. \nHe’s already qualified for the NFL pension plan even though he’s played in just 21 games, starting only one and catching only nine passes — six last year in Seattle — in his first five seasons. \nHe had 28 snaps in New England and 37 in Indianapolis, but was targeted only six times in the two games and caught four passes for 55 yards. He said he hopes to build trust with Bortles going forward. \n“I just want to be me,” he said. “That’s it. When it’s all said and done, that’s all I can do. Go out there and have some fun playing. I’m not going to make anything bigger than it is. It’s fun. It’s a fun game to play.” \nDescribing how he didn’t get this kind of opportunity in the past, he said, “I’ve always been with a team, but there’s always been something that keeps me, I guess, from being on the field, whether it’s a player or whatnot. I’ve always been ready.” \nHis calling card is that he catches everything thrown to him. \n“When that ball is in the air, I have tunnel vision,” he said. “All I see is that ball that’s mine for the taking.” \nHe also can return punts, although that skill wasn’t needed in New England because the Patriots didn’t punt. \nRookie Nick Marshall got the first shot in Indianapolis, but when he fumbled one running up to it, Walters got a chance and returned three for 17 yards. Marshall may get the first chance again Sunday, but Walters could be called on. \nWashington won’t play as much as Walters because he’s the fourth receiver and is making his biggest impact on special teams. He had 10 snaps on offense in Indianapolis and 19 on special teams. Washington wasn’t targeted in Indianapolis, but he had an end-around for eight yards. \nWashington wasn’t drafted out of Appalachian State a year ago, probably because he had wrist and knee surgery coming out of college. He signed with Indianapolis, but was cut at the end of camp. He said he didn’t do well enough on special teams. \nThe Jaguars signed him to the practice squad, and he spent last year there. \nHe was brought up from the practice squad for the New England game because Lee continued to have hamstring problems. He had eight snaps at receiver and 13 on special teams in New England, but he didn’t catch a pass. \nWashington said regardless of how many snaps he gets, it’s a dream come true to be on the active roster. \n“It’s a blessing and you want to do everything you can to make sure you are doing what you need to do to help the team,” Washington said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:44:47.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
