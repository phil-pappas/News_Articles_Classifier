Adding injury to insult was the devastating injury suffered by Victor Cruz. Big Blue are alone in first place for the first time since the 2012 season, but the Eagles are coming off their best offensive performance of the year in a thrashing of the Saints.\nIn the spotlight \nEagles DE Fletcher Cox. The versatile Cox recorded the first three-sack game of his career against the Saints, forcing Drew Brees to fumble twice in the process. Expect Cox to find himself battling against rookie LT Ereck Flowers and LG Justin Pugh, who is out to put last season's performance at the Linc during which he struggled at RT behind him.\nGame plan \nThe Giants took Buffalo's intimidating defensive front out of the game with quick passes from Eli Manning and precision routes. Expect more of the same against the Eagles, who manhandled the Giants' offensive line a year ago in prime time. RBs Shane Vereen and Rashad Jennings should play significant roles out of the backfield in the passing game. The status of WRs Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle is uncertain due to hamstring issues, but Tom Coughlin said Monday he is hopeful they will be available. The Giants' best chance defensively is continuing to shut down not just RBs DeMarco Murray and Ryan Matthews, but also Darren Sproles. Those three will be the top weapons in an offense that QB Sam Bradford still doesn't look comfortable in. The Giants could really use LB Devon Kennard and DE Robert Ayers, both of whom missed the last game with hamstring issues.\nâ€” Art Stapleton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:16:41.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
