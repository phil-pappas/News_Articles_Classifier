(Photo/Chris Knight) \nColumbia ended one losing streak and seeks to slam the brakes on another. \nNorthern Lebanon has a two-game slide it didn't realize it had. \nElco and Donegal need to win to stay in the section race; Pequea Valley must win to realize its dream. \nCertainly, Week 8 is shaping up to be a most interesting one for Section Three teams. \nHere's a look at this week's games: \nElco (3-1 Section Three, 3-4 overall) at Columbia (1-2 Section Three, 1-6 overall): The Crimson Tide ended a nine-game losing streak last week with a 44-13 victory at Ephrata. The win was the first in the L-L for new head coach Anthony Sottasante. \nNow Columbia looks to end another streak. The Tide hasn’t won at home since handling the Mounts in Week 7 last season. \nColumbia rushed for 477 yards on 44 hauls. Dyeqeech Miller did the most damage, running for 253 yards and three TDs on 17 carries. His scoring runs came on carries of 55, 90 and 38 yards. QB Meleik Crenshaw had 111 yards on only 8 carries. \nThe Raiders have one of the most deceiving overall records in the L-L. Last Friday Elco very nearly pulled off one of its biggest wins this season when it took the lead on Northern Lebanon in the fourth quarter and outscored the section champs 27-14 in the second half. \nJeff Martin had a hand in three TDs and Andrew Olsen two for the Raiders. \nAnnville-Cleona (1-2 Section Three, 5-2 overall) at Northern Lebanon (3-0 Section Three, 7-2 overall): The Vikings showed their resiliency last Friday, overcoming first the news of their forfeiture of two wins and an Elco rally in the second half to win 44-41. \nQB Isaac Wengert scored five touchdowns, three on log gainers of 55, 41 and 33 yards. He rushed for 202 of the Vikes’ 406 yards and helped Northern Lebanon extend its L-L win streak to 10 games. \nA-C’s Adam Fox, like Wengert a dual-threat QB, leads the Little Dutchmen. Fox accounted for three scores in a 33-8 nonleague romp over Kutztown and provided big plays of his own – TD runs of 64 and 61 yards and a 39-yard scoring strike to Griffin Hertz. \nBoth teams rank high in Section Three in offense and defense; Vikes’ strong run defense will be tested by Dutchmen’s equally strong ground game. Turnovers could be key and A-C has the advantage, being plus-6 to the Vikes’ plus-1. \nBecause of the forfeitures, the Vikings have fallen to 19 th in the district’s Class AAA 16-team field. The Vikings are also without productive running back Dylan Weaver, who left the team after four games. Weaver was averaging 9.6 yards per carry, had 8 rushing touchdowns and ranked among the league's leading scorers. \nEphrata (0-3 Section Three, 0-7 overall) at Pequea Valley (1-3 Section Three, 3-4 overall): The Braves need to win out to realize their goal of the first winning season in program history. \nQB Jordan Lapp pilots the Pequea Valley offense; Brendan Holbritter helps head the Mountaineers. The Braves rank among the top defensive teams in the section. Pequea Valley is also plus-1 in turnovers; the Mounts minus-1. \nDonegal (3-1 Section Three, 4-3 overall) at Schuylkill Valley (2-5): The Indians are 4-1 against the Panthers dating back to 2006. \nDonegal has won three of its last four, the Tribe powered by a ground game that last week totaled 316 yards and five TDs in a victory over Pequea Valley. \nAustin Dimeler is one of the prime movers in an offense that ranks No. 1 in Section Three. \nSchuylkill Valley has dropped two straight decisions and been outscored 167-95.
