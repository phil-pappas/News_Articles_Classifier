De Groote West Hawaii Today \nMike Reilly’s voice has become an anthem for finish line festivities at IRONMAN events around the globe. After 140.6 miles of swimming, biking and running, athletes know they have reached their goal when they hear Reilly exclaim his signature line, “You are an IRONMAN!” \nSince 1989, tens of thousands of IRONMAN finishers have heard Reilly’s voice as they cross the finishing tape, and the experienced announcer has seen just about everything in his storied career. \nOn most days when Reilly is pursuing his passion, he is engaging an audience for upwards of 17 hours — an IRONMANesque feat in its own right. In 2011, Reilly’s ability unrivaled ability to work a triathlon crowd and inspire athletes landed him IRONMAN Hall of Fame. \nReilly’s voice will be booming around Kailua-Kona and down Alii Drive until the wee hours of the night on Saturday, but the man who has been dubbed the “Voice of IRONMAN” took some time to discuss getting his start behind the mic, his favorite part of his job and everything in between. \nQ: How did you get into this job? \nI announced races in southern California in the late 70s, early 80s. I worked the first professional triathlon in San Diego. I liked calling my friends in. I was a runner and triathlete and if I didn’t race, I was usually asked to announce. It kept growing from there. In 1989 they asked me to come over here and — obviously — I said OK. \nI always wanted to do this race, and everyone has always asked me, ‘Have you ever done an IRONMAN?’ And I tell them, well, I’m out there longer than the athletes are. \nQ: It has grown and changed a lot since those early days though, right? \nPeople always asked me how it has changed. Yes, there is bigger money available for the pros, more sponsors, and more people doing the race. But at the end of the day, it’s still a swim, bike and run. When the cannon goes off it’s the same distance they did back in the day. \nEven though the sport has grown and expanded all over the world, at its core, it’s still all about the swim, bike and run on race day. Go out and get it done. \nQ: What’s the best part about what you do? \nI enjoy calling a race more than anything. I know what these people have gone through to get here. Some sacrifices are beyond what we can imagine. Many people have battled through big things — mental and physical — to get to this point. It is an honor to be able to say their name and be able to all them an IRONMAN. \nIt’s amazing. People are hurting when they come to the finish line, but once I call their name, I see them straighten up, get this look on their face and the crowd starts going wild. It’s never repetitive for me. For that person it’s always the first time. It’s just one after another. \nQ: When and where did the “You are an IRONMAN” line come to be? \nIt was here in Kona, but I worked the race in 1989 and ’90 and never said it. \nI had a buddy doing the race in 1991 and I saw him on the street and he told me he didn’t think he could get it done. I told him he was strong and he could do it. I was trying to encourage him. At the end, I told him he would be an IRONMAN, and walked away. \nOn race day, there he was, coming into the finish line. I see him and said, ‘You are an IRONMAN!” The crowd went wild and I though maybe I’d do it for the next person. Well, the next person was a woman, but I figured it was an IRONMAN race so said it again and the same reaction. I guess I would say I put an exclamation point on that part of their life that is monumental. \nQ: Is there a point for you where it became more than a job? \nYou know, people tell me they would love to have my job, but for me, it’s never been a job. It’s a passion. I feel saying it’s a job takes away from what I do. If I looked at it as a job, I don’t think I could give enough of myself. I’m passionate about it. \nQ: What’s the preparation like? \nI go through the bios of the athletes a ton. We have a column called “Tell us your story,” and a lot of them can make you cry. When the names come up on the computer on race day, I recognize them and their story. It comes back to me, and I try to have a one-on-one conversation with everyone as they come through. \nQ: How would you describe this race in one word? \nSpiritual. \nQ: Why? \nNo matter what you believe in, there is a piece of you that knows things happen in your life that you have no control over. When you come to Kona, it’s like the spirit of this island invades you. On race day, it’s going to beat you down, and give you challenges for all 140.6 miles. But all of a sudden, when you come on in, you will thank that spirit for beating you up all day. It’s a crazy thing. \nQ: What makes Kona special? \nI like everything about Kona. The water is the purest in the world — it’s ridiculous. \nI enjoy the people, everyone I meet. I’ll see a volunteer that has been working the race for 20 years and it feels like seeing your sister or brother. It feels like you never left. This place is my second home. \nQ: What’s race day like for you? \nThe most nervous part of my day is the swim start. I try to talk calmly to the athletes, not only to calm them, but to calm myself. There are a lot of logistics going on. I want to make sure the race starts on time and the cannon goes off. I’ve been at events when it doesn’t start right and it feels like the whole day backs up. You really want that good first impression. \nThen, I love bringing the athletes out of the water. For most athletes, it’s the hardest part of the race. Not everyone has a swimming background. \nBut for me it’s all about the finish line. From 3 p.m. when the winners come in, to the last second before midnight. It’s all fun. \nQ: What kind of experience is the finish line around midnight? \nThe people coming in around 16 hours usually draw a louder cheer than the pros. People know they have been out there for so long. And what is happening a lot now is that athletes are getting done with the race, getting something to eat, showering and coming back to bring in the other competitors. Even the pros come back out. Imagine finishing and Mirinda Carfrae or Sebastian Kienle are putting a medal around your neck. \nThose final two to three hours are magical. When it’s over, I feel like it can’t get any better, but it seems like we raise the level every year. \nQ: Any predictions on the pro race? \nI never do predictions — never have. I know that’s what everyone likes to do and say their favorites. But my favorites are the ones coming across the line. First, second, third, to the 2,500th. My job for me is about taking them across that line. \nQ: What’s the craziest moment you can recall? \nThere have been so many crazy moments, but I think when Sian Welch and Wendy Ingraham crawled across the finish line is towards the top. They looked like gummy bears coming in. I got so caught up in the moment and the crowd was so loud. I remember saying something like, “This is incredible!” Then I went back and watched the tape of it and I said incredible like six times in a row. I felt so stupid! But I was so caught up in it — it was just amazing. There have been so many moments, but that was just nuts. \nQ: Is there any end in sight for you? \nIt’s been 27 years in Kona and this will be my 148th IRONMAN and I don’t see it. I do 10-12 IRONMAN’s a year, so maybe I could see cutting that down. But it’s not about the race or the physical stress. It’s just about being away from home. I always have to promise my wife a week vacation after. \nI think I’ll know when it’s time. I don’t want to be hanging around if I can’t give it all I can give. \nQ: Any last thoughts? \nIRONMAN invades a lot of communities around the world. It’s a strain — 140 miles. I’m amazed how this community enamors itself with this event. I know there are people who may see it as a big imposition, but I think as a whole, the community embraces the event. I take my hat of to them. \nI’ll see the same volunteers year after year, especially at the finish line. For 17 years, they are doing one thing and that is to make sure the athletes are taken care of. There is no formula for that in the world. There is no other event in the world with that kind of synergy. I have been to Super Bowls and World Series games, but I get here and truly feel this is the best event in the world.
