But most places, it’s not very often. That includes Iowa, which is 6-0 for the first time since 2009. The last time before that was 1985. \nSo you have to enjoy these rides on comets while they last. It may be old hat for current unbeatens like Ohio State and Florida State. But not so much at Iowa or Utah. \nThere are 12 unbeatens in the Power 5 conferences. Who among them have the most-impressive win or wins? Let’s opine. \n1. Utah (5-0) \nHome wins over Michigan and California, who both have lost to no one else. The Utes’ blowout win at Oregon lost some shine when the Ducks got beat at home Saturday by Washington State, but Michigan State was pushed to the limit by Oregon, while the Utes crushed the Ducks in Eugene. \n2. TCU (6-0) \nRoad wins over Minnesota, Texas Tech and Kansas State. None are ranked, but none of those places are easy on visitors. \n3. Iowa (6-0) \nPittsburgh’s lone defeat was at Iowa, and Wisconsin has only lost at home just eight times since 2004. The Badgers followed up their loss to the Hawkeyes with a win at Nebraska. Pitt and Wisconsin could both be 10-win teams. \n4. Clemson (5-0) \nA home win over a very good Notre Dame team. The Tigers have also beaten Louisville on the road and Georgia Tech at home. \n5. Texas A&M (5-0) \nA neutral-site (sort of, it was in Texas) win over Arizona State, and a 30-17 home win over Mississippi State. \n6. Florida (6-0) \nThe Gators clobbered Ole Miss in Gainesville, beat Tennessee at home, won easily at Missouri Saturday. Although Mizzou ain’t what it used to be. \n7. Oklahoma State (6-0) \nRoad wins over Texas and West Virginia. Oklahoma couldn’t beat the (formerly?) wobbly Longhorns, and winning at West Virginia is hard. \n8. LSU (5-0) \nThe Tigers’ win at Mississippi State was a good one for sure, but its victories in Baton Rouge over Auburn and South Carolina don’t look as impressive as they might have seemed before this season began. \n9. Michigan State (6-0) \nYou would think the Spartans’ best win was at home over Oregon. At the time, it seemed like a great victory. Now, it looks like winning at Rutgers was just as impressive. \n10. Ohio State (6-0) \nThe Buckeyes’ best victories are at Virginia Tech and Indiana. \n11. Florida State (5-0) \nFSU just recorded its best win, a 29-24 home triumph over a Miami team not as feared as it often has been. \n12. Baylor (5-0) \nBest win: Texas Tech. The Bears’ real schedule doesn’t start until November, when it faces Kansas State, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and TCU in succession. \nThose are the 12 unbeatens from the Power 5s. There are four other unbeatens. They are Houston, Memphis, Temple and Toledo. Nice teams, all three. None would win at Wisconsin.
