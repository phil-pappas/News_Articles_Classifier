I’m fine with what I do. I’m fine with the opportunities that I have. You always wish for more, but I’m going to take advantage of everything I’m given.” \nBrooks has done that through the first five games of the Clemson season, rushing only 12 times but gaining 106 yards, an average of 8.8 yards per carry. \nHe had a 25-yard touchdown run against Wofford and added a 35-yarder against Georgia Tech. \n“I haven’t done anything special, just continue to be me and continue to work hard and continue to take advantage of every opportunity that I have,” Brooks said. “Opportunities don’t come every day. There’s not a lot of those, so when you get them, you’ve got to take advantage. And I felt like I’ve waited for my opportunities to take them when they come.” \nBrooks likely expected to have many more opportunities earlier in his career. He rushed for 119 yards in eight games as a freshman and had 246 yards and two touchdowns as a sophomore. \nIn the first game that season, he caught a 31-yard touchdown pass against Georgia to help the Tigers to a win over the fifth-ranked Bulldogs. \nBut last year, Brooks suffered a foot injury in the preseason and missed the entire season. He said he’s “as good as it’s going to get” with his health and is gaining his timing back on the field. \n“It’s just a game; you’ve got to get the feel of it,” Brooks said. “Playing running back and with the type of running game that we have, you’ve just got to get the feel of it and the timing and all that good stuff, so it took awhile just to get the feel of it. I didn’t get the meat of the physicalness because I had a lot of little stuff going on, so I kind of missed out on all the fast, fast motions of the game. So that would be the only thing is the reason why it took so long.” \nWith Brooks out last year, Gallman stepped into the starting role, and he has shined in that spotlight. Brooks said he’s happy to see Gallman’s growth as a player. \n“I’m real proud of him. I’ve watched him come in. I’ve watched him grow. I’ve watched him put in the work, and he deserves what he’s getting,” Brooks said. “I wish him more. I wish him the best. It’s always awesome to see a brother do good, somebody that you put in work with, somebody that you’ve seen earn it. And he’s earned what he’s got, and he’s done a great job.” \nNow a junior after the redshirt season, Brooks sees himself as a leader of the running back group, along with graduate C.J. Davidson C.J.
