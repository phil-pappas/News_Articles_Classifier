We were standing around too much in the first period, but then we got our feet moving.”\nMichael Mersch scored his third goal of the season with 5:32 remaining in the second period when he tapped his own rebound by the glove side of Ben Scrivens, the former Kings’ goalkeeper who played for the Edmonton Oilers most of the 2014-2015 season.\n“Michael Mersch is too good for this league,” Stothers said. “He is going to be playing in the National Hockey League soon and I hope it is for the Kings.”\nKris Newberry scored six seconds later, tapping Sean Backman’s missed shot in the net on the glove side.\nValentin Zykov tied the score at 15:24 of the second period, coming up with the third goal.\nKevin Gravel snapped the tie when he blasted a shot from inside the blue line below the crossbar with 2:50 remaining in the second period.\nZykov gave the Reign what proved to be a needed insurance goal at 6:57 of the third period.\n“We wanted to keep playing our game and generate some energy and positive things,” said Zykov, a 20-year-old forward from St. Petersburg, Russia who played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:15:33.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
