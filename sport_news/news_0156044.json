She has played in 809 of the 823 minutes this season and has also added a goal to her resum√©, when she scored the equalizer against Texas Tech in the 89th minute back on Sept. 11. \nThe Wildcats took a big jump in all three rankings this week. Arizona checks in at 17th in the NSCAA Coaches Poll, 13th in the TopDrawer rankings and 16th in the RPI. \nMidfielder Gabi Stoian in just two seasons has put herself on several UA all-time lists. The Sophomore is tied for fifth in goals scored (18), fourth in assists (12), fifth in points (48), tied for fifth in game-winning goals (6) and tied for seventh in shots (105). \nAs of late, goalkeepers Lainey Burdett and Rachel Estopare have been sharing the load in the cage. In the last four games, they have each started two of them. Burdett has played 535 minutes and Estopare has played 198 minutes. \nSo far this year, the defense has only allowed four goals in nine matches played, which equates to just under 823 minutes of action. Those four goals allowed are tied for the fewest of all time in the first nine matches of a season (2004). \n10 players have scored 18 goals for Arizona, which is already tied for the third most in school history. On that same note, Oregon State and UCLA have only scored 10 goals while Oregon has scored six. \nCopyright 2015 Arizona Athletics. All rights reserved.
