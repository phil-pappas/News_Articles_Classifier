(OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Last season, Willard was a pleasant surprise as a young Tigers squad won 28 games and a district championship. This season, with raised expectations, the pressure was increased but the result was still the same: another district title and a trip to the Class 4 state playoffs. Willard defended its home court by knocking off Waynesville 25-21, 25-15 in the Class 4, District 10 championship Tuesday night. \"I definitely felt more pressure this year, I tried really hard not to let the girls see it,\" said Willard coach Jamalee Hancock. \"Any time you're the 1-seed, you're the returning district champion and you're at home... it kind of adds a couple of extra layers (of pressure).” It’s the 15th district title in program history for Willard and the sixth under Hancock, who took the reins of the program in 2000. PHOTOS: WILLARD VS. WAYNESVILLE \"I've grown up here since I was little and I had two cousins grow up here,\" said Willard senior setter Kenzie Bouse. \"They played under Coach Hancock and it was just great to grow up and see them, and they're up on the state banner. Just to watch them, it was phenomenal, and now I'm glad to get my own opportunity here on our home court.” Tuesday’s meeting was a rematch of last season’s Class 4, District 10 finals – an epic 25-20, 35-33 outcome won by Willard on Waynesville’s home court. This year, Willard benefited from the support of a rowdy student section, one Hancock said was the biggest of the season. \"We didn't have to travel - we traveled the last three years pretty far. I think we had four fans in the student section last year,” she said. “Our student body was an awesome 7th person for us tonight. I didn't think I've seen quite this many kids from the school and community coming out as we had tonight. That was huge for us.\" Waynesville would jump out to a 14-8 lead in the first set, before Willard answered back with a 7-0 spurt to go in front. Willard closed out the first set, 25-21, then took a lead 12-7 lead in the second set. With much of their attention on the athletic Waynesville tandem of Ariel Okorie and Kallie Bildner, Willard would close out the victory in straight sets. \"We wanted to stop them at the net as much as we could,\" said Bouse, who had a game-high 20 assists. \"We pinned right on them every time to try to stop them at the net because we knew they were (Waynesville's) go-to, so we just stuck with them.\" Bildner led Waynesville with 10 kills in the match. She and Okorie combined for 19 kills as Waynesville took out Lebanon in three sets in an earlier semifinals match. Waynesville, which trailed Central 24-23 in the third set in Monday’s quarterfinal, finishes the season 24-9 overall. SEMIFINAL PHOTOS: WAYNESVILLE VS. LEBANON Timberlyn Barnett had 5 blocks for Willard. Kasey Brower finished with 10 digs and Kara Finkbiner led the team with 6 kills. Hancock said balance is her team’s biggest strength, with the Tigers not having to rely solely on just one player. \"This team has just played with such great composure,\" Hancock said. \"I'm just proud of them because they're a team. We don't have any weaknesses, they all work together really well and they do their job. They're so coachable.\" Willard will host a Class 4 sectional/quarterfinal pod this Saturday. The Tigers face Sedalia Smith-Cotton in the opener, with the winner advancing to the quarterfinals later that day against either Republic or the winner of the District 11 tournament. The District 11 champion will be determined Wednesday night at Kickapoo High School and features four teams with 20 or more wins in Nixa, Kickapoo, Ozark and Glendale.
