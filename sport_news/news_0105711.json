Related Links Manteno air show overpowers Coal City football \nNow 5-4, Coal City awaits Saturday's IHSA pairings day to find out for sure if it will make the 4A playoffs. The Coalers entered Week 9 projected as the 33rd team in 4A in the IHSA's playoff outlook – 32 teams will qualify – but their 37 opponents' wins were more than all but one of the seven teams that started the week 5-3. \n“I think we're good with points,” Coal City coach Lenny Onsen said. “A 5-4 team, you know your draw, what it's going to be. We put ourselves in this boat.”' \nThat the Coalers would get their fifth win remained in doubt early. Seneca's Logan Pifer followed up a 57-yard run with a 2-yard touchdown plunge to give the Fighting Irish the lead after a minute and a half. \nAn injury to the Coalers' usual workhorse, Joe Starkey, opened the door for senior Matt Norton to get eight carries on their opening series. He picked up three first downs before bursting into the end zone from 1 yard out. Norton, who is more typically used as a lead blocker, added a two-point conversion run for what would prove to be the winning points at the 6:47 mark of the first quarter. \n“I was expecting (the workload). Our first back went down last week,” Norton said. “The line did a good job of opening up holes wide-open. Just hit the hole hard and follow them.” \nDanny Kroeger's interception of the first Seneca pass attempt of the game early in the second quarter led to a Nick Micetich 4-yard touchdown run on a quarterback keeper. Seneca then fumbled on its first play of the next drive, with Coal City's Junior Arias recovering, and a Norton 7-yard touchdown run gave the Coalers a 22-7 halftime lead. The score remained unchanged until Nick Hayden added a late 7-yard touchdown run for the Coalers. \nSeneca, which had another lost fumble recovered by Coal City's Alec Leasure in the first quarter, rushed for 199 yards and had 11 first downs, but the early turnovers dashed its hopes for an upset. The Irish also had a pair of second-half drives extend deep into Coaler territory before stalling. \n“We knew coming in that we had to shrink the game up. We had to keep hold of the ball, and obviously not turn it over” Seneca coach Ted O'Boyle said. “We weren't good enough to be able to overcome stuff like that.” \nPifer led all players with 127 rushing yards and also had an interception which he returned 49 yards for the Irish, who finished 2-7 overall. \nCoal City has now won three straight and 11 of the last 12 in its series with the Irish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:04:08.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
