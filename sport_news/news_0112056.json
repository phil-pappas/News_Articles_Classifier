Here's what you will find on the campus of the Washington flagship in the Portland-based McMenamins chain of hotels, restaurants, bars and entertainment venues:\nMain Lodge: This red-brick building gives the complex its name, because it was built in 1931 as Bothell's junior high school. It has been converted into a 72-room hotel, each room uniquely decorated and having its own bathroom. The hotel front desk is in the Tavern on the Square building, a short walk from the north entrance to the hotel.\nPrincipal's Office: A small bar on third floor of the Main Lodge to dispense drinks conveniently to overnight guests, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.\nTavern on the Square: The complex's main restaurant and bar, the place to get breakfast; open 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and until 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. Also located here is the gift shop, open 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.\nWoodshop: A full-service bar and restaurant in a pub-style with pool tables, shuffleboard and games on TV; open 11 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. This houses the second largest McMenamins brewery in the back.\nNorth Shore Lagoon Bar: Located upstairs above the locker rooms for the swimming pool, this full-service bar and restaurant is decorated in a South Seas theme; open 11 a.m. to midnight.\nThe Shed: A small bar, the only new building on the complex, with cozy indoor fireside seating but mainly serving drinks for lots of outdoor seating, covered and heated by fireplaces in winter; open 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.\nHaynes' Hall: The old school gymnasium is the main events venue, with capacity of 700 and served by a small bar that can be supplemented by covered outdoor hospitality space just outside in Haynes' Square.\nMovie theater: The 140-seat theater next to Haynes' Hall shows first-run movies at 3, 6 and 9 p.m. Staff can deliver food and drinks to your seat in the theater. A meeting room of Washington Sen. Patty Murray, who attended Anderson School, shares restrooms with the theater.\nNorth Shore Lagoon Pool: This is a renovation of the old school district swimming pool, still Olympic-size in length but much shallower and now with three huge open skylights in the ceiling and two in a wall. The pool is saltwater and all the plants around it are living. Attended by lifeguards 6 a.m. to midnight.\nAnd more: Ample parking, thoughtful landscaping, three more smaller rooms for private functions and walking distance to downtown Bothell (though there is not much there, yet) and to the school district's football stadium.\nMcMenamins Anderson School is at 18603 Bothell Way N.E., Bothell; 425-398-0122; mcmenamins.com .\nEarlier reports about the opening of Anderson School entertainment complex:\nMcMenamins opens Anderson School with huge Bothell party\nMcMenamins North Shore Lagoon blends tiki bar , swimming pool\nAnderson School features Tavern on the Square, Woodshop restaurants\nAnderson School features Patty Murray Room, movie theater\nMcMenamins Anderson School's Main Lodge features 72 guest rooms\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:17:04.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
