Unfancied Guam is placed third with seven points from four outings, while Turkmenistan is fourth with one point. India is yet to open its account. \nAl Nasr Club's Juma al Jami is the only new face in the team that will be missing its regular members in the squad - forwards Abdulaziz al Miqbali, Sami al Hasani and Said al Ruzaiqi along with defender Azaan al Balushi. \nWhile Jamahi, an attacking midfielder, has been drafted into the team as a back-up for Miqbali, defender Bassim al Rajaibi of Dhofar and Al Musannah striker Mohammed al Ghassani have made a comeback. \nSpeaking to Muscat Daily, Mohammed al Alawi, the national team manager, said, “We knew that Miqbali and Balushi will be away, representing Oman at the World Military Games in South Korea. As for strikers Ruzaiqi and Hasani, both have failed to recover from recent injuries.” \nHe added, “This has forced Le Guen to call up Jami and Ghassani to bolster the attack, while Rajaibi will fill in for Balushi at the back.” \nLe Guen had named 26 players on September 26 for the back-to-back matches against Iran and India, on October 8 and October 13, respectively. \nAlawi said that the 23-member contingent is for the Iran match, with changes expected for the India game following return of Miqbali and Balushi. Both the matches will be played at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex. \nOman captain Ali al Habsi will join the team camp on Monday after having played for his English Championship side Reading in its 2-0 win against Middlesbrough on Saturday. \nThe Red Warriors are currently going through a domestic camp and played a training match against Syria on Friday. Oman beat Syria 2-1, with strikers Qasim Said and midfielder Ahmed Mubarak 'Kanu' on target. \nTeam: Ali al Habsi, Faiz al Rusheidi, Mazin al Kasbi, Saad Suhail, Ali al Nahar, Mohammed Sheeba al Balushi, Jaber al Owaisi, Abdulsalam al Amour, Mohammed al Mussallami, Ali al Busaidy, Bassim al Rajaibi, Ahmed Mubarak ‘Kanu’, Ali al Jabri, Mohsin Jowhar, Raeed Ibrahim, Eid al Farsi, Mohammed al Mashari, Juma al Jamahi, Qasim Said, Imad al Hosni, Mohammed al Siyabi, Saud al Farsi and Mohammed al Ghassani.
