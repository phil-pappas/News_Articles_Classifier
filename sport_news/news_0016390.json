They looked more like the ball club that dominated baseball in the final two months in two Texas days than they did in either game at the Rogers Centre.\nELLIOTT: Jays confident ahead of Hamels rematch\nRUTSEY: Jays give towel boy Holland payback\nBUFFERY: Stroman gets biggest spotlight yet\nAnd in doing it his way, the unintentionally controversial Gibbons shook a few trees, rattled some cages and left many wondering whether he’d lost his mind in the blistering Texas heat.\nBut what he did — more than anything — was babysit the Blue Jays to victory. He worried them to the win. He started the knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, held his breath slightly, and unconventionally pulled him with a 7-1 lead and one batter to go in the fifth inning, thus depriving Dickey of the win. He part-jokingly, part-not, said the decision was “probably not a relationship-building move.”\nThen he did something that maybe no manager has ever done before.\nHe pulled Dickey for Game 1 starter David Price. He went from one Cy Young Award winner to another. Dickey didn’t really understand why he was pulled so quickly, with one runner on base and two men out.\n“So am I disappointed?” asked Dickey. “Sure, I think any competitor should be. But at the end of the day, I’ve said this before and I mean it, it’s amazing what you can accomplish when you don’t care who gets the credit, and we don’t today, so we’re going back to Toronto with a chance.”\nDickey wanted to stay in the game. If truth be told, Price wanted to start the clinching Game 5 in Toronto on Wednesday. He wanted to make up for his first-game disaster.\nBut on the way to a Toronto win, neither got their way. Price was sent to the bullpen before the game started, was told to be ready, was playing catch in the second inning in the centre-field bullpen when he caught Kevin Pillar’s home run. It wasn’t where he envisioned himself when he came to Toronto: Pitching in relief.\nBut Gibbons is setting his team up with the best possible chance to win and, after watching a lot of the Kansas City comeback against Houston, he didn’t want to leave any cards on the table. He wasn’t about to let this game get away from them.\nAnd the sometimes hard-to-understand Gibbons managed with a certain ruthlessness, pulling his starter early, going to his ace starter in the bullpen, pitching without a real left-handed reliever with Brett Cecil hurt and Aaron Loup unavailable, and this was as cutthroat as Gibbons has been.\nOnly a few days ago, he was emotionally turning the ball back to Mark Buehrle for a shot at an individual record, playing a minor-league lineup twice, taking his foot off the gas pedal. On Monday, he drove the Jays like he was speeding through a school zone, fast and slightly reckless: But he wasn’t letting up. There was no time for that.\nNow four games have been played in this American League Division Series, which seems as much a winding novel as four baseball games. The Blue Jays didn’t look much like the Blue Jays at home, came way back to life here in the heat of Arlington. They mashed the No. 3 and 4 Texas starters — the decision to start Derek Holland was more controversial in Dallas than anything Gibbons has attempted in the series — and now it’s down to one game to determine everything.\nGibbons wisely chose Marcus Stroman over Price to start Game 5, the way Jeff Banister chose Cole Hamels over Yovani Gallardo. It couldn’t have been easy, telling your star pitcher he was being bypassed in the most important game of the season for a kid who has yet to spend a full year in the big leagues. That’s what managing can be like at the highest level.\nNot that long ago, he wouldn’t take Jose Reyes out of a game for defensive reasons because of all that would happen because of it: Now personal implications be damned. Gibbons made the right calls Monday. Difficult calls. He has his pitcher of choice ready to go for the clinching game Wednesday night.\nHe didn’t get caught up in the ongoing incongruity of baseball, that delicate imbalance between personal statistics and team success. He did what he thought was right, when he thought it was right. To hell with what you think or I might think. This is the best John Gibbons the Blue Jays have ever seen.\nsteve.simmons@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/simmonssteve\nMLB PLAYOFFS\nSimmons: The best Gibbons the Jays have seen\nBy Steve Simmons , Toronto Sun First posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 09:14 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 12, 2015 11:02 PM EDT\nAll they had to do was win.\nThat’s really all that mattered.
