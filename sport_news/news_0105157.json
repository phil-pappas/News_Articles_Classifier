''But I think we realized after Germany we had to be more solid in order to compete at this level.'' \nTheir program was highlighted by remarkable lifts. \nWe've put a lot of focus on improving our lifts,'' said SÃ©guin. ''We've worked at making them more challenging and original as well.'' \nPiper Gilles and Paul Poirier also reached the podium for Canada, finishing third in ice dance with a score of 157.58. The U.S. team of Madison Chock and Evan Bates (173.22) took gold and Viktoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov of Russia (162.21) finished third. \n'Our goal this year is to make the Grand Prix Final so that result will make it more difficult for us,'' said Gilles. ''Still we were very happy with the performance and we felt it was a step-up from Slovakia.'' \nMeanwhile, Russian world junior champion Evgenia Medvedeva won the women's program, edging U.S. Olympian Gracie Gold in her first Grand Prix Series event. \nThe 15-year-old Medvedeva had a fall on a double Axel combination, but she rallied, adding double toe loops to the end of two jump elements. She finished with 206.01 points. \n\"You always have to think of what you have to do in case something goes wrong,\" Medvedeva said. \"You have to think a step ahead. My coaches and I, we discuss this in case something doesn't work. I know what to do and I do it.\" \nGold doubled an intended triple Salchow late, but that was the only blemish in an otherwise brilliant performance by the 20-year-old, who finished with 202.80 points. \nWorld silver medallist Satoko Miyahara of Japan was third with 188.07 points, while Canada's Alaine Chartrand finished 12th in the field with 148.20 points. \nIn the men's event, Max Aaron of the U.S. finished first (258.95), Shoma Uno of Japan placed second (257.43), while American Jason Brown was third with 238.47 points.
