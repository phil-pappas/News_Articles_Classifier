Join the Conversation Cody Futrell, cfutrell@thenewsstar.com 4:02 p.m. CDT September 30, 2015 ASH quarterback Matthew Beck is the top passer in the Alexandria area and will face one of the top NELA passers in OCS’s Grant Fitzhugh on Friday at 7 p.m. (Photo: THE TOWN TALK) CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe last time Ouachita Christian coach Steven Fitzhugh came face-to-face with Alexandria Senior High quarterback Matthew Beck was on Don Shows Field at Rebel Stadium in West Monroe this past summer when Beck stepped back and fired a perfect spiral 40-yards down the field against the Eagles in the West Monroe 7-on-7 Tournament. \nFitzhugh will get another look at Beck and the Trojans offense this Friday evening with a lot more on the line. \nAlexandria Senior High will be the site of a battle between two of the state’s top passing quarterbacks on Friday when Ouachita Christian, ranked No. 3 in Class 2A, visits the Alexandria Trojans. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. \nBeck has consistently been one of the most prolific passers in Class 5A over his four-year career and he has kept that pace so far this season completing 70-of-103 for 921 yards and 15 touchdowns with no interceptions through four games. The Trojans (3-1) are averaging a staggering 55 points per game this season. \n“He is an outstanding quarterback with a strong arm and they have some talented wide receivers,” OCS coach Steven Fitzhugh said. “We got to see him in 7-on-7 this summer and hopefully our defense will be ready. It is why you do those 7-on-7 tournaments – to get that experience. We have yet to play a pure spread teams we have played. Our guys are working hard and it will be a good challenge for us.” \nOCS (4-0) is led by junior quarterback Grant Fitzhugh who is the reigning Cooper Buick GMC Player of the Week after completing 12-of-13 passes for 157 yards and three touchdowns last week in a 44-0 win over Lakeside. \nGrant Fitzhugh has been accurate and able to make the Eagles offense efficient so far completing 36-of-49 for 662 yards and 11 touchdowns with one interception. \nFitzhugh has been incredibly accurate (73.4 percent) through four games and combined with the fact senior running back Josh Pennebaker leads the Northeast Louisiana area in rushing yards – 688 yards and eight touchdowns on 62 carries – has made the Eagles quite the offensive juggernaut. \nThe power point boost from stepping up three classes plus a win would pay off huge for OCS if the 2A Eagles could beat the 5A Trojans. While the power rankings determine playoff seeding and that boost would be a nice bonus, the Eagles are looking at the big picture. \n“It is good to be playing our toughest test so far here in Week 5, I feel like we are better prepared than if we had played this came a few weeks ago,” Steven Fitzhugh said.” \nGrant Fitzhugh will get a good look at Beck as he will also start at defensive back for OCS. \n“(Beck) is really good,” Grant Fitzhugh said. “He puts it on the money. We just have to do our job and play our responsibilities.” \nConnect with Cody on Twitter @cfutrellTNS or via e-mail cfutrell@thenewsstar.com \n2A No. 3 Ouachita Christian (4-0) at Alexandria (3-1) \nKickoff : 7 p.m. \nRadio: KHLL 100.9 FM (OCS) \nWho/What To Watch: OCS QB Grant Fitzhugh has passed 662 yards and 11 touchdowns to only one innterception.
