(AP) - David McGrath has been named executive vice president and general manager at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway. \nThe 51-year-old McGrath succeeds Jerry Gappens, who resigned. \nMcGrath joined the speedway in November 2011 as the director of advertising and promotions. He was promoted to vice president of marketing and promotions in January 2013 and then to vice president of corporate sales in January 2014. \nGappens, who had been executive vice president and general manager since 2008, pleaded guilty earlier this year to a misdemeanor lewdness charge and agreed to a $500 fine and counseling as part of a plea deal. He said Monday there was no connection between the charge and his resignation. \nThe speedway in Loudon is a stop for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in July and the Sylvania 300 in September. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:16:00.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
