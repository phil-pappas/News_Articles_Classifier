He finds ways to win,\" said Desjardins. \"He's not super flashy. He's not a guy that you rave about offensively, but he's a guy you can win games with.\"\nBo Horvat should have an increased role in his second year, likely centring the third line and getting time on the power play. Vancouver could also to keep one or both of its 2014 first-round picks, Jake Virtanen and Jared McCann, for at least nine-game auditions before having to decide whether or not to send them back to junior.\nBrendan Gaunce, a 2012 first rounder, made a strong case to be a part of Desjardins' plans when the season starts Oct. 7 in Calgary before being assigned to the AHL on Friday, while Sven Baertschi looks to be locked into a spot up front.\n\"When you hear people talking about us getting younger and looking at that as a negative, I think it's a positive for us,\" said Henrik Sedin. \"(There's) a lot of excitement. A lot of players have upside.\"\nRyan Miller is back as the Canucks' No. 1 goalie after missing most of the second half of last season with a knee injury. Jacob Markstrom will serve as the backup following a strong campaign in the AHL that convinced the Canucks they could afford to part with Lack.\nMeanwhile on defence, Matt Bartkowski was signed in free agency to add some speed to a unit that still includes Dan Hamhuis, Alexander Edler, Christopher Tanev, Luca Sbisa and Yannick Weber.\nAnd while Benning said he believes he's improved his roster, the same can be said for many of Vancouver's closest rivals.\nCalgary added forward Michael Frolik and defenceman Dougie Hamilton, the Los Angeles Kings acquired forward Milan Lucic and will be rested and restless after missing the playoffs last season, while the Edmonton Oilers grabbed generational talent Connor McDavid with the first pick in the draft.\n\"I think our team is better now than it was last year,\" said Benning. \"But we're dealing with all the other teams in our division getting better, too.\"\n---\nFollow @JClipperton_CP on Twitter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:05:45.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
