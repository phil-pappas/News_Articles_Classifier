TCU (5-0) 125 (6) 1 2. Baylor (4-0) 125 (4) 2 3. Texas A&M (5-0) 113 (1) 3 4. Texas Tech (3-2) 95 4 5. Houston (4-0) 92 5 6. Texas (1-4) 76 6 7. Rice (2-3) 60 7 8. SMU (1-4) 46 9 9. UTEP (2-3) 45 8 10. UTSA (1-4) 31 11 11. Texas State (1-3 26 10 12. North Texas (0-4) 11 12\n(How the poll works: A first-place vote is worth 12 points, second-place is worth 11 and so on. First-place votes are placed in parentheses next to a school's point total.)\n(Poll voters: Chuck Carlton, Nick Castillo, Mike DuPont, Shehan Jeyarajah, Kate Hairopoulos, E.J. Holland, Bill Nichols, Jose Rodriguez, Kevin Sherrington, Brett Vito, Brandon Wheeland.)\nCLICK HERE TO SEE THE INDIVIDUAL BALLOTS\nBiggest margin: Texas A&M and Texas Tech; UTSA and Texas State. A pair of 18-point gaps throw disparity into an otherwise tight ranking this week. The Red Raiders, having suffered back-to-back losses to TCU and Baylor, are clearly a level below the state's top teams. Texas State, coming off a bye week, is the victim of a tight race between UTEP, SMU and UTSA.\nSmallest margin: Baylor and TCU. Both teams survived their first true Big 12 test: Texas Tech. The road to a Nov. 27 showdown for the state's top spot -- and perhaps a spot in the College Football Playoff -- got a little clearer, though there are still plenty of traps along the way. It will be tough to earn the top spot outright this weekend (TCU plays at Kansas State and Baylor visits Kansas), though a hiccup could cost either team.\nTeam everybody agrees on: North Texas and Texas. It's unanimous for the first time this season: UNT is the worst FBS team in the state, occupying SMU's spot from a year ago. The winless Mean Green were the only unanimous selection, though Texas earned 10 of 11 votes for sixth place.\nTeam nobody agrees on: SMU. The Mustangs remain a mystery. They are clearly better than last year's cellar-dwelling squad, but another poor defensive performance -- 49-23 loss to ECU -- means the wins simply aren't coming, despite an impressive offense. The Ponies ranged from sixth in the poll to 11th.\nBiggest riser: UTSA. The Roadrunners picked up their first win in dominating fashion over UTEP, never allowing the Miners to get comfortable in a 25-6 win. UTSA is better than its 1-4 record shows, playing Arizona and Colorado State competitively in early non-conference battles. There are few reasons to believe UTSA can't make a run and finish at .500 -- or better.\nBiggest faller: UTEP. The Miners only dropped seven points and one spot, but they continue to struggle offensively after the loss of star running back Aaron Jones. UTEP had just 59 yards rushing in Saturday's loss to UTSA, and quarterback Ryan Metz was 23 of 49 passing for 216 yards and one score -- oh, and four interceptions.\nPrevious polls Sept. 28: Bears breathing down Frogs' neck for top spot\nSept. 21: SMU gets fewer votes after close game against TCU\nSept. 14: Despite win, Texas continues slide in poll\nSept. 7: TCU maintains top spot; Longhorns drop in rankings after blowout loss\nPreseason: TCU gets nod as state's best over Baylor to start 2015\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/27/best-texas-breakdown-928-bears-breathing-frogs-neck-top-spot", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-105-baylor-tcu-fight-top-spot-houston-gains-ground-texas-tech", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X9d-Y6H5t2mpqxLSRPd5YPffLnbdbwWyz-hecYSaKjw/edit?usp=sharing", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/20/best-texas-921-smu-gets-fewer-votes-close-game-tcu-texas-tech-closer-3-spot", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/13/best-texas-914-despite-win-texas-continues-slide-poll"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T15:22:17.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
