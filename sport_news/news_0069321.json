(AP Photo/Patric Schneider, File) HOUSTON (AP) Houston Texans outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney is out for Sunday's game against Jacksonville with an ankle injury.\nAdChoices Clowney injured his right ankle before halftime in Houston's loss to the Colts on Oct. 8, but returned after missing only a couple of plays. The Texans hoped he would be ready for this game, but ruled him out on Friday after he missed practice all week.\nThe top overall draft pick last year has appeared in each game for the Texans this season with four starts. He has 12 tackles, three passes defensed and has forced a fumble, but has yet to get his first NFL sack.\nHe played just four games as a rookie because of various injuries before having season-ending microfracture surgery on his right knee in December.\n---\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:06:45.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
