He promises that these picks will make you rich beyond your wildest dreams. \nLast week was the worst week we had in a while, going 3-3 overall, with the three losses being both the Games of the Week and the Hail Mary. We did still nail the Lock, Underdog and Over/Under picks, though, which is encouraging. \nBut I have to be honest with you. If you've looked at the schedule for this weekend, you've probably felt something less than enthused about the slate of games that awaits you. Well, I feel the same exact way about picking these games. \nIt's ugly out there this week, people. We're hoping Kyle Allen can cut down on the pick sixes this week. (USATSI) \nGames of the Week \nNo. 15 Texas A&M (+6) at No. 24 Ole Miss : There is nothing about this game that I'm truly confident about, but since it's the only game this week featuring two ranked teams, here we are. Thanks, schedule makers. Thank you for making me choose between the team that tends to fall on its face down the stretch, and the team that just lost to Memphis and seems to think the season ended after beating Alabama. \nWhy am I taking Texas A&M? Well, the Aggies have been 6-2 against the spread on the road since last season, while Ole Miss is currently 1-3 ATS against SEC teams this season, and has failed to cover the spread in three of four games since the Alabama win. I also have some concerns about Robert Nkemdiche's status after he suffered a concussion last week. Ole Miss 30, Texas A&M 27 \nCheck out the SportsLine pick and prediction for Aggies-Rebels \nTennessee (+15.5) at No. 8 Alabama : Why is this a Game of the Week? Well, because there aren't a lot of options, and this game is on CBS. I'm a good employee if nothing else. \nAs for why I'm taking Tennessee to cover against the Tide this week, well, there's a rather simple formula when it comes to Alabama games. If the Tide are playing on the road, pick them to cover the spread. If they're at home, pick against them. Alabama is 0-4 ATS at home this season. There was the straight up loss to Ole Miss, but the Tide also failed to cover against Middle Tennessee, Louisiana-Monroe and Arkansas. So while I don't expect Tennessee to ever really threaten Alabama in this game, I do expect it to cover. Alabama 31, Tennessee 17 \nCheck out the SportsLine pick and prediction for Volunteers-Crimson Tide \nLock of the Week \nSyracuse (+6.5) vs. No. 25 Pitt : So it's come to this: taking Syracuse as my Lock of the Week. I really do believe in this pick, though! More than I do the others, anyway! You see, Pitt may be 5-1 this year, but it's done much better as an underdog ATS than it has the favorite. Syracuse, meanwhile, is 3-1 ATS at home this year, and 2-0 as a dog. \nBut there's more to this story. It's not just about football, it's about revenge. \nIn the early 1990s, Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi and Syracuse' Scott Shafer worked together at Rhode Island. Long story short, Shafer told Narduzzi he was allergic to kiwi fruit. Narduzzi didn't believe him. So Narduzzi decided to wipe the skin of a kiwi all over Shafer's desk and phone , and was surprised to return to the office and discover that Shafer's eyes were swollen shut . \nOn Saturday, Scott gets his revenge. Assuming Narduzzi doesn't cover Shafer's headset in kiwi before the game. Syracuse 24, Pitt 21 \nCheck out the SportsLine pick and prediction for the Orange-Panthers \nUnderdog of the Week \nBoston College (+7.5) at Louisville : Listen, the Over/Under in this game is set at 37 for a reason. Neither of these teams feature prolific offenses, and both have solid defenses. I wasn't comfortable enough to make this the Over/Under of the Week because the number is set so low, but I am confident enough that in such a low-scoring game, getting over a touchdown will work to my benefit.
