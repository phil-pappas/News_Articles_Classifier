The honor was the third all-conference nod of each player’s collegiate career. Overall, Thunder golfers combined for a 334 to place fourth in the final round and lock up a fourth-place finish in the conference. Trine has earned a chance to compete in the MIAA National Qualifier in the spring. The team will have a chance to earn an automatic-qualifying berth in the national championships. \nWorthington fired an 83 in the final round to finish seventh in the conference standings. The senior finished with an 82 average in MIAA rounds. Worthington earned All-MIAA First Team honors the last two seasons and will wrap up her MIAA career with three all-league performances. US holds on to win Presidents Cup \nINCHEON, South Korea (AP) — The United States held off an inspired rally Sunday to win the Presidents Cup for the sixth straight time, this one decided by the final match. \nThe Americans got the winning point from Bill Haas, the son of U.S. captain Bill Haas, who won 2-up over an emotionally distraught Bae Sang-moon. Bae needed to win the final hole for the International team to share the cup, but he stubbed a chip. \nThe Americans won 15 1/2-14 1/2, the closest competition in 10 years. \nThe tense final session was just what this competition needed, though it didn't feel that way to the International team. It looked like the International team had control until Chris Kirk holed a 15-foot putt on the 18th, and Anirban Lahiri lost the hole by missing a 4-foot putt.
