We're going to try to get the program back to where it was.\" \nThe Thorobreds went 9-18 last season and 7-12 in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. \nIn 2013-14, the team posted a 15-14 overall record and made a deep run in the SIAC Championship Tournament. Kentucky State won its first two conference games before being outsted by eventual champion Tuskegee. \nWilliams helped lead the Thorobreds to a 15-12 record (11-6 SIAC) in 2012-13. \n\"I'm very optimistic,\" Williams said of the upcoming season . \"We've got a young team, and we're a little undersized. We're going to have to work hard, but I think we're going to be the better conditioned team. My goal is for this to be not only one of the most well-conditioned teams, but one of the most disciplined teams, both offensively and defensively.\" \nWilliams came to KSU after coaching for the Cincinnati Public School System since 2003. During his time there, Williams held several head and assistant basketball coaching positions, his most recent being assistant basketball coach at Withrow High School. He also was the head basketball coach of the AAU 17 and under Queen City Prophets, which won a state title in 2010. \nWilliams played shooting guard and small forward at Xavier University from 1995-99.

He is a member of Xavier's 1,000 Point Club and was selected as an honorable mention All-American in 1997-1998. \nAfter receiving his Bachelor of Communication Arts from Xavier in 2000, Williams was given the opportunity to try out for the Sacramento Kings. He also played in the CBL/IBL league, and, in continuation of his professional career, Williams played in several leagues overseas including Turkey, Austria, France and Venezuela. \nIn Venezuela, he won a championship with Marinos de Oriente and was named Rookie of the Year and to the All-Defensive Team in 2003-2005. \nWilliams received his master's degree in sports management from Columbia Southern University in 2009. \nHe and his wife Brigitte reside in Frankfort with their daughter Dorien, son Cameron, and grandson Cameron Jr.  //cin.ci/1RrDedJ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:42:54.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
