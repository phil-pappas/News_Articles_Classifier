Williams will lead South Sumter into today’s highly anticipated game against Orlando Bishop Moore in Orlando. Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 6:00 am \nSouth Sumter at Orlando Bishop Moore. \nIt's a game that many area football fans circled when the schedules were released earlier this year. \nTwo of the winningest programs over the past decade will square off at 7:30 p.m. today at Harry Nelson Field at Memorial Stadium in Orlando in a game that will be televised on Bright House Networks. Both will enter the game ranked No. 3 in their state classifications — South Sumter in Class 4A and Orlando Bishop Moore in Class 5A. \nBoth teams head into the clash on a roll. \nSouth Sumter (6-0) has won 39 straight regular season games. The last time the Raiders lost in October was on Oct. 14, 2011, when Leesburg upset them 13-6 in Bushnell. \nIt's the longest streak ever for a team from Lake or Sumter counties. The state record is 60 wins, set by Lakeland from 1995-2001. \nThe Hornets, on the other hand, are 5-0 and have been dominant against every opponent this season. Orlando Bishop Moore has given up no more than seven points in a game and has extended its regular season winning streak to 18 games. \nAnd then there are the coaches. \nInman Sherman is in his 32nd season at South Sumter and takes a 259-106 career record into today's game. Sherman is the winningest coach in Lake and Sumter County history and has helped turn Friday nights in the fall in Bushnell into a happening. \n\"This should be a really good high school football game,\" Sherman said. \"We scheduled Bishop Moore because we wanted to play a playoff-caliber opponent and we certainly got that with these guys. They are very, very good. They're big and strong and they have no weaknesses that we could find on tape. \n\"And we spent a lot of time looking.\" \nSherman believes Bishop Moore coach Matt Hedrick is a big reason for the Hornets' success. \nIn his 14th season at the helm, Hedrick has compiled a 107-43 record with the Hornets. He has led Orlando Bishop Moore into the postseason 10 times, including last season when the Hornets reached the Class 5A state semifinals. \n\"We're going to find out real quick how good we are,\" Hedrick said. \"We haven't been pushed for four quarters yet this season. That's probably going to change (today). This game should be a real good test for us.\" \nThe Raiders and Hornets have met twice in the past 10 years, with Orlando Bishop Moore picking up victories on both occasions. \nIn 2009, when the Raiders finished 3-7, the Hornets won 31-14 at Raider Field. The following season, a 2-9 campaign for South Sumter, Orlando Bishop Moore picked up a 26-10 win in Orlando. \n\"They don't give you stuff,\" Sherman said. \"They don't turn the ball over. That's going to be a challenge for us. We have to score when we have opportunities and we have find a way to force them into a couple of mistakes. \n\"We're just going to do what we do and we should know by the end of the first quarter how good our game plan is.\" \nSouth Sumter will have a number of weapons at its disposal against the Hornets. \nThe Raiders have six players with at least 189 yards rushing, led by J.T. Taylor, who has 333 yards and seven touchdowns. Taylor is averaging 11.9 yards per carry. \nBokeyon Rice has also surpassed the 300-yard mark and is averaging 8.4 yards per carry. Wyatt Shaw, Isial Flowers, Deon Williams and quarterback Bryce Williams also have made major contributions to the Raiders' running attack. \nThe Raiders are averaging 283 yards on the ground per game but are so balanced that no player is running for more than 55 yards per game. A total of 20 different players have toted the football this season. \nBut South Sumter is hardly a one-dimensional team. \nWilliams has progressed as the season has moved along and has forced opposing defenses to respect his ability to throw the ball. Williams has completed 32 of 54 passes (59.3 percent) for 544 yards and 10 touchdowns. He has yet to throw an interception. \nThe Hornets, likewise, present a balanced attack. Against South Lake last week, quarterback Collin Hartmann and running back C.J. McNeal scored on short blasts and placekicker Jake McIntyre booted a pair of field goals, including a 47 yarder. \nIn addition, Rayshad Lewis found the end zone on a 92-yard punt return and the defense chipped in with a pick-6 that covered 46 yards. \nSouth Sumter's defense also is a force to be reckoned with. \nThe Raiders are giving up an average of 13.3 points per game. South Sumter is giving up 217.7 yards per game and holding opponents to a 25.3 percent conversion rate on third down. \n\"We better bring our 'A' game, on both sides of the football,\" Sherman said. \"Our kids are excited to be playing Bishop Moore. There was a buzz at practice this week, particularly on Monday when we began putting the game plan together. \n\"This is going to be the toughest game we've had all season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:18:17.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
