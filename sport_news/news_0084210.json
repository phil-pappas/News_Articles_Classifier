(AP) - Scientists say the number of dead dolphins washing shore is declining five years after the Deepwater Horizon Spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\nAccording to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the number of dolphins and whales killed by exposure to the oil was 1,433. About 87 percent were bottlenose dolphins. Some washed ashore dead, other were stillborn or born prematurely.\nScientists say some had a bacterial infection caused by the oil suppressing the dolphins' immune system.\nBP declined to comment on the dolphin die-off.\nScientists and other experts will next decide whether to officially declare that die-off stretch over, but no decision has been made yet.\nJenny Litz, a research biologist, told the Tampa Bay Times ( http://tinyurl.com/nqpw3bh ) the 2010 Deepwater incident die-off will go down in history as \"the largest, and longest, dolphin mortality event ever in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\nInformation from: Tampa Bay Times (St. Petersburg, Fla.), http://www.tampabay.com .\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
