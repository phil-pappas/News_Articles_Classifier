That means Republicans must choose a new person to yell at while they noisily fail to govern.\nAgreeing on a qualified leader may sound easy, but remember, this is Congress, not a sophisticated governing body like an elementary school student council or a troop of lightly concussed chimpanzees.\nPredictably, there is chaos among the ranks.\nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California seemed the most likely person to take Boehner's place, but he accidentally suggested that the main purpose of a House committee investigating the terrorist attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi was to damage Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Fellow Republicans responded by saying, \"You weren't supposed to say that out loud, dummy! No speaker job for you.\"\nThe chairman of that Benghazi committee, South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, also was considered a contender but didn't want the job, telling NBC News: \"I think the House is bordering on ungovernable right now.\"\nOregon shooting v. Planned Parenthood and the debate over life Rex W. Huppke Here are a few facts:\n• Yesterday, a little more than a month after the nation watched two journalists get shot to death on live television, a little more than three months after a man killed two people and wounded nine others in a Louisiana movie theater, a 26-year-old gunman killed nine people...\nHere are a few facts:\n• Yesterday, a little more than a month after the nation watched two journalists get shot to death on live television, a little more than three months after a man killed two people and wounded nine others in a Louisiana movie theater, a 26-year-old gunman killed nine people...\n(Rex W. Huppke) Ouch.\nThat leaves the following possible candidates:\n•Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan\n•A frowny face emoticon\n•John Boehner tied to a chair\n•Zombie Ronald Reagan\nThe emoticon would not meet the constitutional definition of \"a person\" — sad to see such bigotry still exists these days — and Zombie Reagan, while timely for Halloween, remains supernaturally implausible.\nBoehner tied to a chair would likely fail. The speaker said that before leaving he will try to pass some important legislation, like funding the government. That enraged some of the GOP's more zealous House members — who believe the primary roll of governing is to not — and they threatened to vote Boehner out before he even has a chance to step down.\nRyan, a former vice presidential candidate, is believed by many to be the only person GOP lawmakers can rally behind. Those not in the \"many\" are the roughly 40 conservative representatives who adorably call themselves the Freedom Caucus.\nIt's a collection of tea party patriots who think government is dumb and compromise is an evil behavior indulged in only by godless liberals. They advocate economy-wrecking government shutdowns over legislatively impossible goals — like repealing Obamacare or defunding Planned Parenthood — that are only embraced by the most conservative of voters.\nNorman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and co-author of the book \"The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track,\" told Bloomberg recently: \"The House Republicans are in full implosion mode, a reflection of the deep and unresolved, and maybe unresolvable, schism in the party between radicals who want more confrontation on the debt ceiling and the budget, and bedrock conservatives who want to find ways to show that they can govern while holding both houses of Congress. Right now, it is clear that the radicals have the upper hand.\"\nAnd those radicals say Ryan isn't conservative enough, which is a bit like saying the knife that just cut my finger off wasn't sharp enough.\nRep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a leader of the Freedom Caucus, told the Associated Press: \"Everybody's interested in a new type of leadership.\"\nLet me translate that from faux-patriot fetishist to English. \"Everybody\" means \"the people in the Freedom Caucus,\" \"interested in\" means \"will hold their breath until they get,\" and \"a new type of leadership\" means \"someone who agrees with everything they say, no matter how staggeringly unrealistic it may be.\"\nRyan may decide to run for House speaker, but a lack of absolutism may be his downfall. Nuanced opinions, common sense and an understanding of how government functions are disqualifying attributes.\nAnd that's why I have found the only candidate who can lift House Republicans out of this management morass: a large rock with the word \"NO\" painted on it.\nConsider the qualifications of large-rock-with-the-word-\"NO\"- painted-on-it:\n•Resolute in its opposition to everything.\n•Immovable due to its fierce patriotism (and because it is a large rock).\n•Incorruptible and inanimate.\n•100-percent American because I found it in my backyard.\nLarge rock with the word \"NO\" painted on it (nickname: Denial Rock) might be in the pocket of Big Geology, and there is some debate over whether it's igneous or sedimentary. (Denial Rock says it experimented with being igneous in college but is now born-again sedimentary.)\nBut those are minor flaws. Denial Rock is clearly the most qualified aggregation of minerals for the job, and I expect it to win the House Speaker position in a landslide. (Sorry.)\nDenial Rock will give members of the Freedom Caucus a leader who is their ideological and intellectual equal.\nAnd it will give the members of Congress who actually want to get something done a nice, firm object to bang their heads on.\nrhuppke@tribpub.com\n U.S. House of Representatives Republican Party U.S. Congress John Boehner Paul Ryan U.S. Debt Ceiling Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560eab72/turbine/ct-oregon-shooting-huppke-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56252a5c/turbine/ct-house-speaker-huppke-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:41:35.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
