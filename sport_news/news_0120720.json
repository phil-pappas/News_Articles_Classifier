The Badgers (6-0) scored on every possession they had the ball in the first half. Quarterback Gavin Deaton was a perfect 6-of-6 passing for 269 yards and four touchdowns in the first two quarters. “It absolutely was a dominate performance,” Arkadelphia freshman head football coach Trent Smith said. “We didn’t run very many plays. We took what they were giving us with their alignment. We knew we could some big plays early and Gavin connected on his passes. They were daring us to throw the ball and he connected on some passes and we were able to run it to the end zone and put up some quick points.” Deaton passed to Zion Hatley for a 71-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage for the Badgers in the game. Gabe Goodman added the extra point for a 7-0 lead with 7:40 to go in the first quarter. Fountain Lake took its first possession to the Arkadelphia 30 and was stopped on tackles for losses by Arkadelphia’s Carl Brim and Jalen Adams. Two plays later, Deaton found Hatley open for a 59-yard catch and run for a touchdown. Goodman’s kick made it a 14-0 lead with 2:31 to play in the first quarter. Fountain Lake moved the ball down to the Badgers 15 and turned it over on downs on an incompletion on fourth down. Deaton ran for 16 yards for Arkadelphia and then passed to Alec Ruble for a 66-yard touchdown. Goodman’s kick made it a 21-0 game with 6:14 left in the first half.

Goodman’s kick was blocked to make it 41-0. “The defense did a good job of holding them out and pitched a shutout,” Smith said. “It was phenomenal. We had a great week of practice. The whole week was really relaxed. They executed offensively and defensively. They watched a lot of film and understood what we were going to try to do and what Fountain Lake was going to do. They just came in an executed real well. We have to get ready and do it again next week against Mena.” Page 2 of 2 - The Badgers amassed 399 yards and had only four first downs in the game. Turner led the rushing attack for Arkadelphia with 71 yards on four carries. Fountain Lake made six first downs and had a total of 146 yards, all of which came from its ground game, and it’s only two pass attempts were caught by Badgers. “The offensive line did a great job of blocking,” Smith said. “For the most part, we had plenty of time to throw and Gavin was on the money. Hatley made two great catches for touchdowns. We had holes to run through. It was just clicking and we looked really good tonight. We have to continue to get better. We can’t be satisfied where we are at. We have to stay hungry and get better every single day.” The Badgers will return home next Thursday to take on Mena. 8th grade Badgers win, too The eighth grade Arkadelphia Badgers defeated Fountain Lake 28-0 on Thursday night.
