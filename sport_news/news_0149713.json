BAD FALL: Injured jockey Davin Green is taken away from Cannon Park by emergency crews after his horrifying tumble at the Cairns Amateurs last month. PICTURE: ANNA ROGERS Source: News Corp Australia \nDAVIN Green is having more luck with the phone in the right than the cigarette in the left. \n“I have things in my hands and the next thing I know they’re not there,” the Ipswich jockey says. \nIndeed, Green’s tenuous grip makes our conversation a stunted one. \nA flagging voice box, collateral damage bracketed with many spinal injuries, doesn’t help either. \n“It’s still very awkward to swallow,” Green says. \n“My voice is always changing now because they had to cut my throat and move my wind pipe out of the way to operate. \n“You don’t realise how much your spinal cord controls, things like your nerves and bladder. \n“There are all these little things you take for granted every day.” \nPerspective rarely hits like this. \nIt’s now a month since Green fell while riding Road Warrior, the sorry bystander from the snapped leg that ended the life of racing rival Mr Wrecker. \nFor more than 10 minutes the jockey lay motionless on a Cannon Park surface that, in one horror moment, changed from being centre of pre-Amateurs attention to mere byproduct of the drama. \nSuddenly a soggy track didn’t seem so important. \nNow, in front of thousands of shaken punters, a life was on the line. An eerie calmness, rather than crippling terror, flowed through Green in a moment that will never leave him. \n“I broke my neck before I hit the ground,” he says. \n“I flipped and landed on the horse’s rump and I just heard this crack. \n“I remember thinking ‘I’m going under here’, which is a shame because if I wasn’t going to win I was going to go close. \n“I didn’t feel anything after that. \n“I can tell you it’s a terrible feeling when you look down and your arms are just flopped over. \n“When they ran over to me I said ‘my neck is broken guys’. \n“After a while I started to get feeling back in my legs. But I never panicked and I don’t know why.” \nGreen has since seen more hospital beds, more operating rooms and more doctors than anyone would ever like. \nAfter initially being taken to Cairns Hospital, doctors then transferred the 48-year-old father-of-two to Brisbane. \nAn operation on a fractured C3 and C4 vertebrae, the “best” sort of broken neck, then followed. \nBut it was to get worse. \nA pinched blood vessel ­behind Green’s neck cut his blood flow and induced a mini-stroke that would leave his grip on things – cigarettes, phones – an endless struggle. \nThere are still dizzy spells while lying in bed. \nDriving remains a no-go. \nAnd Green has a permanent companion of pins and needles. \n“I have had bad falls but I couldn’t walk away from this one,” he says. \n“I’m lucky because there are people in that spinal unit who will never get out of a bed or wheelchair. \n“Maybe I’ll ride again and maybe I won’t. I would love to be able to because I was really enjoying it at the time. \n“But I can’t thank the ­ambulance crew who came over enough. \n“And I hope (jockey) Sonja (Wiseman) doesn’t feel bad about anything – that’s just racing.” \nGreen’s optimism, clearly, has not been hurt like his body. He is now living with daughter Josie, 19, and gets regular visits from son Jayden, 16. \nThe lawn-mowing business he started two-and-a-half years ago continues, albeit without the owner behind the wheel. \n“I have wasted away but at least I have always been strong and solid – that saved me,” he says. \n“You can’t keep me still. \n“I had a frame in hospital so I was up and walking. \n“Every day I wake up I have a bit more feeling. \n“The doctors don’t know and they can’t tell you anything, but I’m very strong-willed and my body is willing. \n“It’s a hard road but I’ll get through,” he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:49:59.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
