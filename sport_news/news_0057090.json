Seattle started the year with expectations of contenting in the AL West and reaching the postseason, but instead finished in fourth place in the division. \nDipoto was hired to replace Jack Zduriencik the final week of the regular season and said he would take his time evaluating whether McClendon would return. McClendon was under contract for the 2016 season.
