Ryan didn't go into specifics, but noted the quarterback will be monitored through the week as Buffalo (3-2) prepares to host Cincinnati (5-0) on Sunday. \nTaylor missed one play against Tennessee after turning his left ankle while being tackled after a 24-yard run. Taylor's backup is former starter EJ Manuel. \nJohnson was signed a day after being released by Indianapolis. In seven seasons, he has 1,042 yards passing, five touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 29 games, including five starts. \nThe Bills also cut kicker Billy Cundiff. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:06:03.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
