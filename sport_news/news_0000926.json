It is the first online course approved by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources as a way for snowmobilers to obtain the state’s snowmobile certification.\nMinnesota requires snowmobile certification by law for anyone born after December 31, 1976. Before the launch of SNOWMOBILEcourse.com, snowmobilers needed to take a classroom course or a mix of classroom and home study by CD-ROM. Now the required training is available to anyone with an Internet connection, including mobile devices.\n“The launch of our first online snowmobile safety course builds on our existing classroom course study options and helps make snowmobile education more accessible to the many snowmobilers in Minnesota,\" said Jon Paurus of the Minnesota DNR.\nBuilt and supported by Fresh Air Educators, the providers of Minnesota’s online hunter education course, SNOWMOBILEcourse.com uses illustrations, video and narration to create an engaging experience for the student. Students can study at their own pace, stopping and returning to where they left off whenever they like.\n“The launch of SNOWMOBILEcourse.com allows Minnesotans to get the snowmobile safety training they need, when and where it works best for them,” said Kerry Moher, VP at Fresh Air Educators. “That’s going to mean more snowmobilers taking the course, which will mean safer trails for all riders.”\nSnowmobile operators aged 16 and over are now able to receive their entire certification online at SNOWMOBILEcourse.com. Operators aged 11-15 can take part of their course online at SNOWMOBILEcourse.com and then complete their certification with an instructor.\nFind out more, and register today, by visiting SNOWMOBILEcourse.com.\nFresh Air Educators is North America’s leading provider of online outdoor education.
