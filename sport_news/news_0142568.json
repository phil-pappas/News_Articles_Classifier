From youth to varsity, Herrick was instrumental in the success of any program he has been involved with. \nOn Sept. 25, Herrick was an honored guest at the Vestal boys’ soccer game, with a celebration of 50 years of the varsity team occurring at halftime. \n“It was fantastic, the honor that they gave me, and I really enjoyed walking down the line and shaking all the players’ hands,” Herrick said. \n“They were all very polite and smiled and thanked me for coming and for what I did to help them get to where they were. It was unexpected, but it was an honor.” \nHerrick and his wife, Linda, moved to Vestal in the fall of 1963 and he began teaching science at Vestal High School in the fall. There was no soccer in Vestal at the time, so Herrick helped to get a modified team started in 1965. He worked his way up from being a varsity assistant in 1966-67 and became a head coach in ’68. \nWith a desire to get kids participating in soccer at a younger age, Herrick and about half a dozen others met behind Vestal High School at what was then St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church to establish Vestal Little League Soccer in the 1968-69 school year (the name was later changed to Vestal Youth Soccer to avoid any confusion with baseball). \n“At that time, football was big in Vestal and we wanted to develop a similar program in soccer,” Herrick said. “I was the varsity coach at the high school, and we wanted to develop something for the kids, but also something that could function as a feeder program for the varsity team.” \nHerrick let others coach the youth teams, but advised the coaches and also helped recruit kids for the program, sometimes taking an active role in spreading the word. \n“I was in a neighborhood that had 12 to 15 kids, and George came riding down the hill with another guy and asked us if we wanted to play soccer,” said Kevin Hughes, who played in the first season of youth soccer, and went on to play for Herrick on the undefeated 1975 Vestal varsity squad. “They had the first practice at the baseball field that night. There were about 3 or 4 teams and we played games up at Arnold Park.” \nGeorge and Linda ran several camps throughout the northeast, starting with Camp Husky in Montrose, Pa., in 1969. The Herricks also led camps at Colgate, Syracuse, Mohawk Valley Community College and SUNY Cortland (his and Linda’s alma mater). \n“It’s just another way to get the kids involved in soccer and have a ball at their feet early on,” Hughes said of the camps. “That was unheard of at the time.” \nYouth soccer players watch the action during the Vestal boys soccer team's Sept. 25 game against Horseheads. The children were part of an Olympic soccer-style lineup and also played a game on the field during halftime.

He coached and was later the Director of Coaching for the New York State West program, was the coach and later state coordinator for the men’s soccer team at the Empire State Games, and has been a volunteer coach for former Vestal player Mike Doherty at Colgate. \nThe list of Herrick’s soccer accomplishments would make for a pretty long book. In 29 seasons as a coach at Vestal, he amassed a 469-88-38 record and led the Golden Bears to state titles in 1982 and ’85 (co-champs). He was voted into the Section IV Hall of Fame in 1998 and to the New York State Coaches Hall of Fame the following year. \nOne of his fondest memories was being named the National High School Soccer Coach of the Year in 1990, an award given to only one boys coach and one girls coach throughout the U.S. \n“The experience was super,” Herrick said. “They had us come to the Nashville Convention Center. We were there for a week, and I had to teach two soccer classes to other coaches though no one knew who the winners were yet.” \nIn honor of the 50th anniversary of the Vestal varsity soccer team, players from the Vestal Youth Soccer program got to accompany players onto the field before the Sept. 25 game against Horseheads.

Many of the current coaches and youth officials played for him at some point, and Herrick Field, which hosts varsity practices and junior varsity games, is named in his honor. \n“I played for him from 1994 to ’96. He’s kind of a living legend around here,” said Rich Warren, president of the Vestal Youth Soccer Association, an offshoot of the program Herrick started, which includes a travel program. “He’s been retired for 20 years, but he still has a pretty good influence over soccer in this area.” \nAlthough Vestal came out on the short end of a 3-2 score in that Sept. 25 game against Horseheads, the night was still memorable for those in attendance. Youth soccer players walked onto the field with their varsity counterparts and got to meet Herrick before the game. The young players also played during halftime. \n“I saw him that night shaking hands with the kids,” said Vestal varsity coach Dave Barr, who Herrick hired to be the modified coach 25 years ago. “Just from all his accomplishments, you can tell he’s dedicated to the sport of soccer, and it’s good to see that all the work he did is continuing here.” \nHome Games focus runs on Mondays.
