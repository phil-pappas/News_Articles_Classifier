I'm proud of him. \n\" The experiences that he's had this last year have been awesome for him. I don't think he'd change that now. For him to play in a World Cup as a dual international, I don't think he'd regret that.\" \nAll four siblings - oldest brother Luke and twin George are still playing in the NRL - are known to be close but Tom insists he was not hurt by the stinging criticism of Sam in the media. \n\"At the end of the day, it's their jobs to report about it,\" he said. \"Everyone's got their opinions and takes on things. \n\"I don't get annoyed with it, it's just a talking point. I don't think it's personal. They've got to make a story and it's fair enough. It's what sells papers, isn't it? \n\"He knows how to handle it now. He's pretty well drilled with the media and he's got pretty thick skin.\" \nDespite having two years left on his contract with Bath, Burgess has been linked with both a return to Souths and a move to newly-crowned Super League champions Leeds and Tom admits the speculation is rife in Sydney. \n\"I get asked about a hundred times a day in Australia, especially from South Sydney fans,\" he said. \"It is a bit of a talk of the town at the moment about whether Sam's going to come back to league or not but at the moment it's just speculation. \n\"It's what everyone wants in league but a t the end of the day it's his decision and he'll make the decision based on how he's feeling. He's signed up for two more years at Bath so that's it.\" \nWhile Tom went to watch the Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford on Saturday evening, Sam rejoined Stuart Lancaster's squad at the Etihad but will almost certainly link up with his old league team-mates during England's three-match Test series against New Zealand. \n\"He'll most likely get to the London game,\" Tom said. \"I think he'll try to get to all of them if he can. He'll even try to come into camp. He presented the jerseys last year and that was good. He pumps the boys up a little bit.\" \nMeanwhile, Tom insists he has no plans to switch codes as he gears up for England's one-off international against France at Leigh on Saturday week. \nTom, who has been training on his own in Australia since Souths were knocked out of the play-offs, admits it is a strange feeling being the only Burgess brother in the England camp. \n\"It is a bit funny,\" he said. \"I've always had either Sam or George here but it's good in a way. \n\"I'm never going to get called George and it's an opportunity to try and be a bit more of a leader in this squad. I've been involved for two or three years now and hopefully I can step up a bit more.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:05:12.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
