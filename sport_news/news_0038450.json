And it lies with the example set by the BC defense, now perhaps the best in the nation but a few years ago young, inexperienced, and overmatched. Comment By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff   By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 9:45 PM By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 9:45 PM CHESTNUT HILL — Three years ago, one a true freshman and the other a redshirt freshman, Steven Daniels and Connor Wujciak were forced into duty before their time. The Boston College defense was inexperienced to start the season, and then injuries hit hard and forced players not close to ready for prime time into significant roles. The results weren’t pretty. The Eagles ranked 102nd nationally in total defense and 113th in rushing defense, and a 2-10 season was the ultimate result. A year later, with the defense marginally better with young players still needing to gain experience, Justin Simmons, a sophomore, was called upon to play at key times when BC traveled to Syracuse. And according to coach Steve Addazio, then in his first season at the time, Simmons didn’t handle the moment well. Even last year, as the Eagles rose to become one of the better defenses in the nation, after Bryce Jones was dismissed from the team and there were injuries to others in the secondary, John Johnson, a sophomore reserve, was thrust into a starting role and struggled with consistency. Now, after going through growing pains, all are key players on a deep, talented, experienced defense that statistically ranks as by far the best in the nation. The offense, however, is where the defense was three years ago, inexperienced, decimated by injuries, and struggling. And because of it — with a trip to Clemson looming on Saturday night — BC is just 3-3 overall, 1-3 against FBS teams, and 0-3 in the ACC. Yet there’s hope for the young offense, and it lies in the progression the defense made toward brilliance. “I can certainly relate to being a young guy on the field — you’re looking all over the place,” said Wujciak. “It can be a little overwhelming. ... I’ve tried to tell some of the young guys.” Inexperience was going to be an issue for the BC offense coming into the season given that starting quarterback Darius Wade was a sophomore and hadn’t played any meaningful snaps the season before, and that four of the five offensive linemen were first-year starters. And then injuries hit. Since the start of the season, Wade has been lost for the year with a broken ankle, center Frank Taylor has been out the last three games, tight ends Mike Giacone and Louie Addazio have missed time — Giacone for the year — lead running back Jon Hilliman has been lost for the season with a broken bone in his foot, Hilliman’s lead backup Myles Willis has missed the last three games with a shoulder issue, and even reserve running back Marcus Outlow has been slowed by injury. Page 2 of 3 - Addazio, who said he’s finally decided on a single quarterback to replace Wade but won’t announce it until later this week, turned the position over to a competition between redshirt freshman Troy Flutie and true freshman Jeff Smith with neither mature enough to perform well enough to claim the job. Meanwhile, there’s been no production out of the tight ends, and the running game, while playing well enough to rank 25th nationally, hasn’t been able to gain any consistency behind a beleaguered front and without its own top personnel. Compounding matters, senior kicker Alex Howell suffered a quadriceps injury forcing freshman Colton Lichtenberg into duty. And Lichtenberg missed makeable field goals that might have led to wins over Duke and Wake Forest. “We break down a lot, and we break down a lot because of unbelievable inexperience, so we need to try to create more explosives because it’s hard to sustain these long drives,” said Addazio. “We’re not doing it. ... And then, of course, make field goals when you have a chance to make field goals because that’s scoring in the red zone and that stimulates energy. “We’re a couple of field goals away from being 5-1, and that’s hard.” Because how much youth is playing important parts in the BC offense, and because of how much failure is a part of growth, Addazio finds himself being a psychologist as much as a strategist. He wanted, for example, to use freshman running back Jordan Gowins late in last Saturday’s loss to Wake Forest, but Gowins’ fumble earlier in the game had led to the Demon Deacons’ only points and Addazio didn’t want to put a player already in a fragile state into a spot where he could be broken by further failure. “It’s all about how you handle the team, how you handle young players,” said Addazio. “You have to push them enough to drive them — we want to be a tough football team — but you can’t shatter them. It’s all about that right now.” Yet there’s reason for optimism. And it lies with the example of the defense. There’s just how good it is, so immovable that even though BC has scored just seven points in three games against ACC teams the Eagles could easily be 2-1 in conference play. And there’s also just how bad the BC defense was a few years ago before it grew up. “Coach always tells the younger guys that some of the older guys have been through a lot,” said Daniels, “and some of those (young) guys take heed of it and they’re starting to pick it up.” Page 3 of 3 - BC can’t get back the games it gave away to Duke and Wake Forest. And facing Clemson in Death Valley is a daunting task. But the margin between victory and loss has been razor thin. Maybe, just maybe, even the most moderate improvement by the offense can recover a season that seems on the verge of spinning out of control.
