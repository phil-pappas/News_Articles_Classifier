We were in front and we made mistakes for the penalty and the goal,” said Benitez. \n“We lacked precision on the counter-attack. We had eight chances to counter but weren't accurate with the final or penultimate pass.” \nHowever, Atletico boss Diego Simeone believed his side would have been deserving winners. \n“In the second-half we had a lot more chances. We equalised and then their keeper made a great save at the end,” said the Argentine. \n“The feeling is that we have lost two points and that we were very close to winning a game that on chances we deserved to win.” \nGareth Bale was left on the bench by Benitez as he made his return from a calf injury. \nHowever, Real started the brighter and Jan Oblak had to scurry from his line to smother an effort from Benzema after just seven minutes. \nThere was nothing the Slovenian could do, though, to prevent the Frenchman moving out on his own as La Liga's top scorer with six goals as he powered home a header from Dani Carvajal's inch-perfect cross from the right. \nChopped down \nAngel Correa was the one bright spark for Atletico in the first 45 minutes and he nearly pulled the hosts level with an angled drive that flew just wide after a neat one-two with Oliver Torres. \nSimeone's men had a great chance to level on 21 minutes when Madrid captain Sergio Ramos chopped down Tiago inside the area. \nRamos was lucky to escape with just a yellow card but Navas pulled off his second penalty save of the season from Griezmann with a brilliant low stop to his left to maintain Madrid's lead. \nSimeone threw on Vietto, Martinez and Yannick Ferreira Carrasco in the search for an equaliser after the break as Atletico went on to dominate the second period. \nFernando Torres had the first opening of the half, but dragged his shot horribly wide from Correa's fine through ball. \nBale was also introduced for the final 25 minutes but made little impact as Real sat back in the hope of holding onto their lead. \nHowever, Benitez's men were undone when Martinez got to the by-line and, despite Navas's best efforts from Griezmann's initial effort, the ball fell kindly for Vietto to prod home. \nMartinez then had the chance to seal a famous comeback, but his fiercely struck effort from the edge of the area was brilliantly turned behind by Navas. \nEarlier, Villarreal missed the chance to extend their lead at the top of the table as they were beaten 1-0 at Levante. \nVillarreal were reduced to 10 men on 35 minutes when Bojan Jokic saw a straight red card for a high challenge on Ivan Lopez. \nThe visitors held out until seven minutes from time when Brazilian striker Deyverson converted Nabil El Ghilas's cross to take Levante off the foot of the table. \nThe pressure on Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo was increased as his side blew a 1-0 lead to lose 3-1 at Athletic Bilbao. \nAnd Real Betis moved up to eighth as goals in either half from Heiko Westermann and Ruben Castro handed them a 2-0 win at Rayo Vallecano. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:28:57.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
