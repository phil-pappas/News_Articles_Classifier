The prize awarded on Tuesday, promotes the finest in fiction by rewarding the very best book of the year, The Man Booker Prize foundation said. “This is the riskiest novel I have ever written. Not just in subject matter but in form also,” James said. Inspired by murder attempt on Reggae king Bob Marley, Marlon James’ ‘A Brief History of Seven Killings’ takes the form of an imagined oral biography, told by ghosts, witnesses, killers, members of Parliament, drug dealers, conmen, beauty queens, FBI and CIA agents, reporters, journalists, and even Keith Richards’ drug dealer. Bob Marley was to perform at the Smile Jamaica concert to ease political tensions ahead of the country's general elections in 1976, when seven men from West Kingston stormed his house with machine guns on December 3 that year. He survived and went on to perform at the free concert. But he left the country the next day and didn't return for two years. The story traverses strange landscapes and shady characters, as motivations are examined — and questions asked. Since his death on May 11, 1981, Marley’s legend looms larger than ever, as evidenced by an ever-lengthening list of accomplishments attributable to his music, which identified oppressors and agitated for social change while allowing listeners to forget their troubles and dance. Last night, James becomes the first ever Jamaican to win the Man Booker Prize for Fiction for his ‘A Brief History of Seven Killings’, published by Oneworld Publishing and distributed by Pan Macmillan India. Set in Kingston, where James was born, ‘A Brief History of Seven Killings’ is a 704-page book with over 75 characters and voices. The 44-year-old James, now a resident of Minneapolis, also credits Charles Dickens as one of his formative influences, saying, “I still consider myself a Dickensian inasmuch as there are aspects of storytelling I still believe in — plot, surprise, cliffhangers.” James was announced as the 2015 winner by Michael Wood, Chair of Judges, at London's Guildhall last night. He was presented with a trophy from The Duchess of Cornwall and a £50,000 cheque from Emmanuel Roman, Chief Executive of Man Group. In his comments, Wood said, “This book is startling in its range of voices and registers, running from the patois of the street posse to The Book of Revelation. It is a representation of political times and places, from the CIA intervention in Jamaica to the early years of crack gangs in New York and Miami. It is a crime novel that moves beyond the world of crime and takes us deep into a recent history we know far too little about. It moves at a terrific pace and will come to be seen as a classic of our times.\" Congratulating James, Rajdeep Mukherjee, senior vice-president of Pan Macmillan India, said Pan Macmillan India is proud to represent the outstanding Oneworld list and bring literature of the finest range from across the globe to readers in South Asia. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:57:31.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
