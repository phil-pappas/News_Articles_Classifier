But that challenge went from daunting to insurmountable in the blink of an eye — or, more accurately, the kick of a football. “It didn’t help that they returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown,” Bulldogs coach Justin Kogler said following a 42-16 loss. “Anytime that happens, it’s a bad start.” The Falcons put up 14 points in each of the first two quarters while blanking the Bulldogs for the entire first half. ORR rebounded in the final two frames, scoring eight in each. They scored in the third on a 1-yard touchdown run from Corey Dias, with Grant Reuter catching the 2-point conversion from Cam Hamilton. The quarterback and receiver hooked up again in the fourth, with Reuter hauling in a 15-yard score. Darien Dumond ran in the 2-point conversion to account for the final score. “Corey Dias ran the ball really hard. He and Grant Reuter really gave us a spark,” Kogler said. “We played well defensively at times, but we were just letting up too many long runs. That’s really the big difference now — we’re not making teams earn it with long drives, and instead they’re popping off big runs.” Old Rochester (0-5) visits Wareham Friday night at 7 p.m. By Tim Weisberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:18:07.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
