In the group final, a 55-44 loss to Linden, Mahoney scored 16 points and pulled down six rebounds. \n“It’s a great fit for him academically and athletically,” Ridge coach Brian Feath said. “I’m real happy for him.” \nWith his college decision made, Mahoney can now focus on his senior year and getting back to business with his teammates. \n“It’s definitely a weight off my shoulders, it’s been such a long process, especially over the summer and getting it over with I definitely feel I made the right decision and it’s great,” he said. “Now I can just focus on the high school season.” \nMahoney will be a strong addition to a Boston University team that finished 24-11 last season, 15-3 in the Patriot League, advanced to the Patriot League Tournament final and fell in the first round of the NIT to Illinois. \n“They were so welcoming and how they treated me once I was on campus I felt they were commited to me,” Mahoney said of the Terriers’ staff. “They came to the high school three times to see me play ... that meant a lot to me.” \nStaff Writer Lauren Knego: lknego@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1FFPeap TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:02:30.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
