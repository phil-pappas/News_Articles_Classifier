We lost our focus and after 10 minutes changed the game completely. \n\"This was our problem and we need to learn. We are young but if you are the best team on the pitch after 10 minutes and you believe you can win the game you need to win the game. We lost our focus.\" \nPochettino, normally mild mannered, expressed his dissatisfaction with his players' inability to put them in a prime position to qualify for the knock-out stages. \n\"I am angry, frustrated, disappointed. I don't know which word to describe me. \n\"We need to be focused for 90 min, 95 min. Football is like this. We are under pressure now. We have to win but I am happy about that. We need to feel the pressure. Because if not, after 10 minutes it seemed like it was an easy game and we have lost.\" \nAnderlecht coach Besnik Hasi was pleased to see his side pick up their first win in this season's competition and believes they did a great job of recovering from the early setback of Eriksen's goal. \n\"It's nice to win against such a team,\" he said. \n\"Especially after the poor start against Monaco and Qarabag - we knew it was our last chance today. In the second half we put higher pressure on them and played with much more courage. \n\"After the break we dared more with a 4-3-3 formation so we got more space and opportunities. Tottenham clearly came to win and gave the necessary space away for us to exploit.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:14:04.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
