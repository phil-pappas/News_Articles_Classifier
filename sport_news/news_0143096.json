The late-season addition of Mike Napoli helped the club finish 35-31 after a slow start.\n\"We're very left-handed,\" Daniels said. \"So that's something that we'll talk about. I don't think it's a coincidence we faced the most left-handed starters of any team in the big leagues this year. Teams adjusted accordingly.\"\nBringing back Napoli, a free agent, might be the easiest, most cost-effective way of better balancing the middle of the lineup.\nIt also might cost the Rangers Mitch Moreland.\nMoreland, who made $2.95 million in 2015, is heading into his last season of arbitration and is likely to see his salary nearly double after a career-best year. There will be plenty of demand for a guy capable of hitting 25 to 30 homers who will make $6 million or less in 2016, particularly from National League teams, which face lefties much less frequently.\nIf the Rangers traded Moreland, it would open up some extra cash to dedicate toward Napoli, who would slide in as a right-handed-hitting first baseman. Daniels acknowledged Friday that there has been \"very casual\" conversation with Napoli in which both the club and player expressed a desire to extend the reunion.\n\"We were much better against [left-handers] the last two months,\" Daniels said. \"Internally, guys made improvements, and [Napoli] being in there helped a lot.\"\nIf clubs engage the Rangers on Moreland, it could also create a more legitimate spot for Joey Gallo on the big league roster if he's ready. He could play first base against some right-handers, spell Adrian Beltre a bit at third, perhaps spell Prince Fielder occasionally at DH and even play some left for Josh Hamilton.\nRangers eliminated from postseason\nRangers loss reviewed Rangers offseason issue No. 2: Improving team balance could cost this key contributor\nRangers could have another major pitching free agent to deal with\nRangers offseason issue No. 1: Is there enough starting pitching?
