Don't tell Neil Young. The rocker, in the midst of a crusading \"The Monsanto Years\" tour, may not have had Morrissey-esque powers of problematic food removal at the Portland venue, but there was no mistaking the sound of his message.\nThe otherwise visually modest set was shaped by two bits of theater: a duo in farmers' clothes, throwing out seeds before Young opened the set with a solo performance, and corporate villains in haz-mat suits spraying down the stage with pesticides—er, stage fog. The crowd booed them, and someone shouted \"No more GMOs!\" at the farmers.\n\"The Monsanto Years\" takes aim at the controversial agriculture company with some extra ammo for Starbucks, alongside corporations \"too big to fail/too rich for jail\" and the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. Young's devotion to these subjects and others—high-resolution audio, hybrid cars, defending farmers and so on—has seemed single-minded at moments in his public life, but he was a careful preacher on Wednesday, sparing the crowd a stump speech and weaving the new songs in among familiar favorites. He played \"A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop\" after \"Alabama,\" and followed the anti-corporate \"Big Box\" with 1970's scathing \"Southern Man,\" as if to say, I'm still fighting. I've always been fighting.\nWherever one stands on his issues, it's a mark of his conviction that Young's never tired of activism. On Wednesday, it didn't seem that he tired at all, playing through hour after hour without a bathroom break. I don't think I've ever seen a band of 20-somethings play with such endurance, much less a man about to turn 70.\nHe did have a few youngsters with him: Promise of the Real, whose current incarnation includes Willie Nelson's sons Lukas and Micah. Young and the elder Nelson are regulars together on the charity/protest concert circuit these days, but Young's appreciation for his colleague goes way back: there's a story in \"Shakey,\" the Young biography, about the musician chasing Nelson's country sound, and borrowing his former bassist, during one of Young's many sonic detours.\nThe outlaw influence emerged as Young eased onward from solo guitar, harmonica and piano songs—among them, \"After the Gold Rush,\" \"Heart of Gold,\" Comes a Time,\" and \"Old Man, which he paused after realizing, \"I forgot to say hello.\" The band joined him for suitably country-styled \"Hold Back the Tears,\" \"Human Highway\" and a moving \"Out on the Weekend,\" the original Canadian sad-boy anthem: it was the \"Know Yourself\" of 1972. Lukas Nelson took lead vocals on \"September Song,\" a track Willie sang beautifully on \"Stardust\": it was a thrill to hear the son's similarity to his dad, but better to watch Young do his best Nelson-style guitar solo.\nAnd in a three-hour-ish set, there were solos. The show's volume gradually turned from 1 to 11: by the time the band reached \"Southern Man,\" the mind-meld between Young, Lukas and bassist Corey McCormick had reached a transcendent connection. But there was meandering, too, as set closer \"Love and Only Love\" offered volcanic, art-noise explosions that dissipated into false endings and patience-testing ambience as the hour crept toward 11. Can't sleep in on Thursday? There's probably a place you can go to get coffee. Just don't tell Neil.\n-- David Greenwald\ndgreenwald@oregonian.com\n503-294-7625; @davidegreenwald", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/davidegreenwald"], "published": "2015-10-08T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:57:07.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
