Fiorentina coach Paulo Sousa was in perfect position to answer that question after losing by the same score to Napoli and Roma in consecutive weekends. \n\"Napoli created more difficulty for us defensively, so I think they're better balanced between the two areas,\" Sousa said. \nNapoli and Roma meet for the first time this season on Dec. 13. \nIn Wednesday's midweek round, Roma hosts Udinese while Napoli welcomes Palermo. \nAlso this week, it's: Bologna vs. Inter; Milan vs. Chievo Verona; Atalanta vs. Lazio; Frosinone vs. Carpi; Sassuolo vs. Juventus; Torino vs. Genoa; Hellas Verona vs. Fiorentina; and Sampdoria vs. Empoli. \nHere are some things to know entering this week's matches: \nLAZY HIGUAIN: \nWith seven goals in nine matches, Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain shares the league scoring lead with Sampdoria's Eder and is on pace to drastically improve his output of 17 and 18 goals over the last two seasons, respectively. \nNapoli's first-year coach Maurizio Sarri was singing Higuain's praises after the Argentina international scored a second-half goal in a 1-0 win at Chievo on Sunday. \n\"At the beginning of the season I told him that I thought he could become the best striker in the world but that he had to work for it because on certain plays he was too lazy,\" Sarri said. \"He applied himself and now he's showing that he's an extraordinary player.\" \nFLORENZI'S FORM \nDefense, midfield or attack, it makes no difference where Alessandro Florenzi plays. \nRoma's utility man tends to stand out wherever he lines up — with a flair for the spectacular. \nPlaying fullback, an alert Florenzi set up Gervinho for Roma's second goal in Sunday's 2-1 win when he caught Fiorentina's defense out of position. \nThe goal was reminiscent of how Florenzi scored from near the halfway line against Barcelona last month. \nFlorenzi is also turning into a midfield fixture in the lineup of Italy coach Antonio Conte. He scored one goal and set up another when Italy overturned a 1-0 deficit for a 2-1 victory over Norway earlier this month to win its European Championship qualifying group. \nRoma coach Rudi Garcia was asked if Florenzi could become one of the best wingers in Europe. \n\"I've thought so for a while,\" Garcia responded. \"He can play in every position on the right flank and maybe he ought to be paid the worth of three players.\" \nJUVENTUS RECOVERING \nAfter losing three of its opening six matches, Juventus is unbeaten in three games. \nPaulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic scored in a convincing 2-0 win over Atalanta on Sunday. \nMassimiliano Allegri's squad appears on the rise after a rough start shaped by the departures of Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Carlos Tevez. \n\"There's room for improvement,\" Allegri said. \"Now we need continuity.\" \nAndrew Dampf can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/asdampf \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:13:50.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
