The Storm improved to 6-0, while Eldorado slipped to 5-1.\n“Eldorado’s a tough, tough team,” Storm quarterback Gabe Ortega said. “We expected a game like this, and I think we’ll see them again in the playoffs. This was a great win for us.”\nOrtega had a monster night, hitting 25 of 38 passes for 349 yards and three touchdowns, with one interception. He also rushed for 101 yards, keeping numerous drives alive with his scrambling ability.\nEldorado quarterback Jayce Jackson nearly matched Ortega, tossing four touchdown passes – three of them to David Inman – and making a number of drive-sustaining plays with his arm and his feet.\nBut the game ultimately came down to a late Cleveland drive that was aided by a pair of key flags. With the score tied at 34, Eldorado forced the Storm to punt from its own 24 with 4:05 remaining. But as the ball was kicked, the Eagles were called for an illegal substitution. Head coach Charlie Dotson came onto the field to argue and picked up a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct flag.\nSeven plays later, Nieto scored the winning TD.\n“In a game like this you need big plays and you need to get lucky,” Cleveland coach Heath Ridenour said. “We got some of both tonight. Gabe Ortega made so many big plays. He’s just special.”\nThings did not start well at all for Cleveland, which fumbled on its first play from scrimmage. It set up a 24-yard touchdown pass from Jackson to Inman that gave Eldorado a 7-0 lead just 38 seconds into the game.\nCleveland was forced to punt on its next series, and once again the Eagles’ offense capitalized. Jackson completed four passes on an 80-yard drive, including a 22-yard scoring strike to Inman for a 14-0 lead.\nThe Storm offense then shook off its sluggish start. Ortega engineered two long scoring drives to tie the score by halftime. He hit Justice Jackson with a 5-yard scoring pass to finish the first drive, and Landry Hayes scored from a yard out on the second.\nCleveland grabbed its first lead on another short Hayes rushing TD in the third quarter, but the teams would go back and forth for most of the final two quarters.\nThe Eagles had a golden opportunity when Inman picked off an Ortega pass at the Cleveland 34 with 7 minutes remaining in a tied game. But Hayes recovered an Eldorado fumble two plays later to start the final Cleveland scoring drive.\n“The defense bailed me out on that one,” Ortega said. “It takes a team to win a game like this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:53:08.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
