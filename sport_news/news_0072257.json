North Stanly junior Antonio Williams, a 4-star running back, has de-committed from the University of Wisconsin. \nRunning back Antonio Williams, the highest-rated prospect in the University of Wisconsin’s 2016 recruiting class, decommitted from the Badgers on Wednesday afternoon. \n“After talking to the staff and through thorough thinking and praying for understanding, I have decided to re-open my recruitment and decommit from the University of Wisconsin,” Williams said via Twitter. “This is being done out of pure respect for the staff and I would not feel like an honest individual if I did not do this and took a visit to another school. I hope that all will respect my decision as I do what is best for me and my family.” \nPer multiple reports, Williams plans on taking an unofficial visit to Ohio State this weekend. \nWilliams, a four-star prospect, became the first member of the 2016 class when he committed to UW in December and has played a major role in recruiting other players to join him in Madison. \nThe Badgers now have 20 prospects in their 2016 class.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:42:11.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
