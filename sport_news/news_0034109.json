(AP) — The Chicopee Police Department has filed a criminal complaint against a former city mayor following an altercation he had with an officer at a polling location.\nPolice say Michael Bissonnette got into an argument with Lt. John Pronovost on Sept. 8 at Edward J. Bellamy School. The Republican reports Pronovost told Bissonnette to remove a campaign sticker or button because campaign materials are forbidden near polling places.\n Bissonnette tells WWLP-TV he left the building, but that Pronovost taunted him and said unkind words about his wife. Bissonnette says he told Pronovost that he ‘‘disgraced his uniform’’ and walked away. He was not arrested.\nPronovost applied for a criminal complaint and now Bissonnette is expected to be arraigned on Nov. 5 on charges including assault and battery on a police officer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:03:14.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
