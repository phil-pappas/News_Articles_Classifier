We are devastated for the fans, for the result and feel very, very harshly done to.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:12:29.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
