Deputies who knocked on the door were initially denied entry by party host Payton Smith, 19, police said, but were later allowed in.\nThe party had been posted on Facebook, police said, and \"grew to an unruly size.\" A fight broke out, and shots were fired at the house from outside. At least one shot struck the house, but no one was injured.\nIt's not clear who fired the shots, police said, but five people in a car stopped nearby were arrested.\nDeputies arrested a 15-year-old boy on suspicion of theft after he told them he had taken a gun that matched casings found near the house. A 16-year-old boy was found with brass knuckles, police said, and arrested on suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon.\nJorge Perez, 23, of Portland, and a 15-year-old boy were arrested on probation violation warrants.\nAnd Diamond T. Wilson, 20, of Portland, was arrested on suspicion of harassment in connection with the fight at the party.\nSmith, the party host, was also arrested on suspicion of furnishing alcohol to minors.\n-- Elliot Njus\nenjus@oregonian.com\n503-294-5034\n@ enjus", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/enjus", "http://media.nj.com/monmouth_impact/photo/19040751-small.jpg", "http://media.nj.com/monmouth_impact/photo/police-lights2jpg-2b89993ebd4156cb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:02:38.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
