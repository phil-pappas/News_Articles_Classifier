Having sorted out the grey areas that existed last year, particularly in the midfield and defence, Chennaiyin FC have roped in some strong players from Brazil and Italy for this season. Chennayin has also retained the core of the squad that enabled them to top the league stage last year. The home team’s star midfielder and golden boot winner last year with nine goals, Elano Blumer of Brazil, would play a significant role in determining Chennaiyin’s fortunes this year as well. Besides replacing players like Mikael Silvestre and Eric Djemba-Djemba with Italian midfielders Manuele Blasi and defender Allessandro Potenza, Chennayin have also recruited Brazilian midfielder Raphael Augusto and defenders Eder Monteiro and Mailson Alves. The icing on the cake for Chennaiyin is the signings of Ethiopian striker Fikru and Cameroon goalkeeper Apoula Edima Edel Bete, both migrating from Atletico de Kolkata . And come this year, the southern outfit would look to the duo to dish out game changing performances that they produced in the inaugural season of the tournament. Chennaiyin’s manager-cum-player Marco Materazzi has made sure that in his team at least two players are fighting for each position, which will give enough depth and balance to the side. On the other hand, Atletico de Kolkata have signed Japanese-born Indian midfielder Arata Izumi and defender Rino Anto. Besides, the title holders have also roped in four domestic stars — Lalchhawnkima, Augustine Fernandes, Amrinder Singh and Kunzang Bhutia. Atletico de Kolkata have made significant changes to their team this year. The team management’s decision to release players like Fikru, Luis Garcia and Jofre Mateu, who played a key role in their title-winning run, has definitely raised a few eyebrows. But despite the layoffs, Atletico de Kolkata sport the look of a champion side. In Helder Postiga, the youngest marquee player of the tournament, the Kolkata outfit has roped in a world-class striker and the side has a lot of expectations from the Portuguese World Cupper. Another newcomer in the Kolkata side is last season’s best player award winner, Iain Hume of Canada, who migrated from Kerala Blasters. — PTI Live on Star Sports, 7pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:17:19.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
