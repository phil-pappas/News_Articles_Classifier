Sooner in the Hills, with an average date of September 29 in Lead. \nOther first measurable snow in South Dakota usually waits until the last couple of days of October into the first week of November. They include October 30 for Aberdeen and Mobridge, November 1 in Huron, and November 3 in Sioux Falls. It's a little later in Yankton with an average first snow date on November 11. \nWhile temperatures will cool this week, we're keeping snow out of the forecast. But, with a stronger blast of cold air around midweek next week, we'll see if we can generate some in the Hills of western South Dakota. There are some models hinting at that. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
