In the 38-17 win over Ohio Dominican, Vander Laan broke the record with a 53-yard TD run in the second quarter. He finished the game with 161 yards on the ground and two touchdowns to go with 151 yards through the air.\n\"This was literally the last thing I would have told you (would have happened) when I was a freshman,\" Vander Laan said Saturday in an interview on SportsCenter.\nVander Laan is 38-2 in his career at Ferris State. Last year, he won the Harlon Hill Trophy as the best player in Division II as a junior. It's the same award Lions running back Joique Bell won at Wayne State.\nWofford's Shawn Graves had the previous record of 5,128, set in 1992. The 6-0 Bulldogs have four games left on the schedule so who knows where Vander Laan's total will be at season's end.\nU-M can't win pity\nUSA TODAY's Dan Wolken puts out a Misery Index to rank the 10 most agonized fan bases of the week.\nAs you may imagine, Michigan ranks very high on this list this week. But they're somehow only No. 2.\nHow can that be, considering how U-M lost to rival MSU on Saturday?\nWolken: \"There is one thing preventing Michigan from being No. 1 on this list. The Misery Index, see, is about more than just one week or one play. And though the ending to Saturday's 27-23 loss to Michigan State was one of the all-time gut punches and will forever be part of this rivalry, it is undeniable that the Wolverines are ahead of schedule under Jim Harbaugh.\"\nThe top spot went to Ole Miss, which lost at unbeaten Memphis. Three other Big Ten schools were mentioned: Indiana, Penn State and Purdue.\nCompiled from staff reports by Kirkland Crawford: kcrawford @freepress.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:54:58.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
