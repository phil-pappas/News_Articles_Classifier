But the offense remains banged-up and out of synch and may be without quarterback Jay Cutler for a second straight week. The Oakland Raiders come to town this weekend, as road favorites nonetheless, looking to score their third straight victory. In the lead up to Sunday’s contest, here are a handful of eye-catching facts and figures.\n200: Rushing yardage by Bears running back Matt Forte in the first halves of the team’s three games this season. Forte has had 42 of his 59 carries before halftime. And the Bears have won the time of possession in the first half this season 53:49-36:11. In the second halves of games, Forte has rushed for 76 yards.\n13: Points scored by the Bears after halftime in three games this season. On 15 second-half possessions, they have punted eight times, committed two turnovers and turned the ball over on downs three times.\n0: Second-half possessions the Bears have had this season with a lead. The Bears’ lone lead after halftime this season was a 13-10 advantage over the Packers in Week 1. But the Packers put together a 59-yard touchdown drive on the opening possession of the second half and never looked back.\n20: Catches so far this season by Raiders rookie Amari Cooper. That ranks 15th in the NFL through three games. Cooper, who was selected No. 4 overall in this spring’s draft, has turned those 20 grabs into 290 yards and a touchdown.\n23: Catches so far this season by the entire corps of Bears wide receivers, adding up to 297 yards without a TD. Eddie Royal leads the way with 11 catches for 66 yards. Tight end Martellus Bennett is the team’s leading pass catcher with 13 grabs for 118 yards and a TD.\n7: Phil Emery draft picks who are no longer with the Bears. Emery made 20 selections in his three drafts from 2012-14 but few have lived up to their initial billing. Linebacker Jon Bostic (second round, 2013) and safety Brock Vereen (fourth round, 2014) were the latest to be sent packing, each let go earlier this week. Bostic was traded to the Patriots for a sixth-round draft pick. Vereen was waived. Other Emery picks previously let go from the Bears include: Khaseem Greene (fourth round, 2013), Jordan Mills (fifth round, 2013), Brandon Hardin (third round, 2012), Evan Rodriguez (fourth round, 2012), Isaiah Frey (sixth round, 2012) and Greg McCoy (seventh round, 2012).\n6: Emery draft picks who are current Bears starters. The list comprises right tackle Kyle Long (first round, 2013), receiver Alshon Jeffery (second round, 2012), linebacker Shea McClellin (first round, 2012), cornerback Kyle Fuller (first round, 2014), defensive tackle Ego Ferguson (second round, 2014) and receiver Marquess Wilson (seventh round, 2013).\n8: Bears starters on offense and defense who are homegrown – either drafted by the organization or signed as undrafted rookies. The four-time defending NFC North champion Packers, meanwhile, had 20 homegrown starters in their 38-28 Monday night win over the Chiefs. That included 17 draft picks and three players who joined the team as undrafted free agents.\n7: Combined playoff appearances by the Bears and Raiders since the start of the 2000 season. The Bears reached the postseason in 2001, 2005, 2006 and 2010. The Raiders were in the playoffs in 2000, 2001 and 2002 but have not been back since losing Super Bowl XXXVII to the Buccaneers.\n618: Combined field goals made by Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski (369) and Bears kicker Robbie Gould (249). Janikowski entered the league in 2000 as a first-round pick and is now second amongst active kickers in field goals made. Adam Vinatieri (478) is the active leader. Gould ranks seventh amongst active kickers in that category.\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Oakland Raiders Matt Forte Amari Cooper Robbie Gould Tampa Bay Buccaneers New England Patriots", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d9e1e/turbine/ct-go-figure-bears-raiders-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:59:15.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
