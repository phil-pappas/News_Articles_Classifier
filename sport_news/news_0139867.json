The junior running back bounced quickly to the outside and accelerated up the home sideline to put the visitors in front. \nThree minutes later, Roberto Bravo Jr. tied the contest by capping a seven-play Wyandotte drive with a 1-yard TD plunge. A three-and-out punt that ended the second Huskie series and the Bears needed less than two minutes to travel 65 yards for a go-ahead score on a 49-yard screen pass to Carson Loncarich. Nathan Richardson of Pawhuska picked off a conversion pass attempt to keep it at 12-6. \nA second-period punting exchange ended with Richardson intercepting another Wyandotte pass deep in Huskie territory, but a high Pawhuska snap four plays later gave the Bears an 8-point advantage on a safety. The home team then launched a 76-yard drive to a TD pass from quarterback Braxton Douthit to Loncarich with less than three minutes to play before halftime. Wyandotte managed to tack on one more TD before the break — to go up 28-6 — and were driving for another before an interception by Pawhuska’s J.R. Young. \nThe second half was all Bears until the Huskies marched 84 yards in 12 plays for the game’s final score. No time was left on the clock when Graves ran 17 yards for his second TD and Caleb Bruce kicked the extra point. Wyandotte sophomore Bravo rushed for three TDs and returned one of his two interceptions for a fourth. Loncarich, a junior, caught eight Douthit passes good for two TDs and 199 yards. \nWyandotte 48, Pawhuska 13 \nPawhuska Huskies: 6 - 0 - 0 - 7 —13 \nWy’nd’te Bears: 12 - 16 - 20 - 0 — 48 \n1st quarter \nP — Warren Graves 87-yd run (kick fail), 9:43 \nW — Roberto Bravo 1-yd run (kick fail), 7:00 \nW — Carson Loncarich 49-yd pass from Braxton Douthit (pass fail), 3:36 \n2nd quarter \nW — Safety, snap out of end zone, 6:44 \nW — Loncarich 16-yd pass from Douthit (kick fail), 2:43 \nW — Bravo 4-yd run (Bravo run), 1:20 \n3rd quarter \nW — Bravo 16-yd interception return (Douthit kick), 6:45 \nW — Bravo 11-yd run (Douthit kick), 1:23 \nW — Douthit 2-yd run (kick blocked), :21 \n4th quarter \nP — Graves 17-yd run (Caleb Bruce kick), 0:00 \nGAME STATISTICS \n1st downs: Pawhuska 8, Wyandotte 19 \nRushes-yards: P 32-191, W 40-129 \nPassing yards: P 11, W 205 \nPass comp-att-int: P 6-20-2, W 9-19-2 \nReturn yards: P 119, W 103 \nPunts-avg.: P 8-31, W 4-36 \nPenalties-yds: P 11-102, W 7-58 \nRushing \nPawhuska — Warren Graves 9 carries for 139 yards (2 TDs), Brian Jeffers 12-37, Caleb Bruce 8-19, Colton Hindman 2-0, Nathan Richardson 1-1. \nWyandotte — Roberto Bravo 21 carries for 82 yards (3 TDs), Braxton Douthit 13-36-1 TD, Zach Garrett 3-0, Caleb Hurst 2-4, Denton Ward 1-8. \nPassing \nPawhuska — Colton Hindman 4 completions from 13 attempts for 13 yds, Caleb Bruce 2-7-minus 2 yds-2 intercepted \nWyandotte — Braxton Douthit 9 of 19 for 205 yds with 2 TD and 2 intercepted. \nReceiving \nPawhuska — William Merrill 2 catches for 9 yds, Gage Dagenais 2-7, Brian Jeffers 2-0. \nWyandotte — Carson Loncarich 8 catches for 199 yds (2 TDs), Caleb Hurst 1-6.
