The young Panamanian had entered this warm evening as a playoff shortstop, fielding with aplomb and recording the finest at-bats of his not invariably stellar career. Now his throbbing and fractured right leg was encased in a black walking boot. As reporters watched, he put a silver-gray crutch under his arm and took half hops out the door. A few seconds later, Mets Manager Terry Collins walked in and shoved two laundry carts to the side. He loosened a curse for good measure. The reporters all wanted to ask Collins about the slide by Chase Utley – a rolling tackle, really – that had upended Tejada and threatened to do the same to his team’s playoff chances. Was it a dirty move? Collins peered out from under his visor. “Broke my shortstop’s leg, that’s all I know.” Was he surprised that Utley stood at the center of this? The manager’s eyes narrowed; his jaw was piano-wire tight. “We know that he plays with great passion and great aggression.” Which is to say no. Collins was not surprised nor was anyone else. For the past decade, Chase Utley was a name that Mets-loving New Yorkers invoked to frighten little children into silence. That owed to Utley’s undeniable talent as an All-Star second baseman with the Philadelphia Phillies , his soul-crushing home runs and his run-scoring singles. It also owed to those instances that he seemed to play to the edge of violence. Five years ago, he upended Tejada for the first time, a rolling block so hard that the usually placid Carlos Beltran, then still a Met, was moved to say that Utley had “crossed a line — not only on that play.” “Once you try to hurt somebody, that’s no fun,” Beltran added. Utley is on the back end of his career now, a bench player with the Los Angeles Dodgers . His once considerable skills have not entirely deserted him; in the pivotal moments of Game 2 on Saturday night he was inserted as a pinch-hitter, shortened his swing and singled against that rocket-thrower Noah Syndergaard. On the next play, Utley ran at Tejada like a cornerback taking aim at a receiver. \nAdvertisement OCT. 10, 2015 Some press commentators mumbled that Utley’s slide was just “good old-fashioned baseball”; we retreat into cliché to avoid thought. The facts are these: In the bottom of the seventh, with the Mets hanging on to a one-run lead, Utley’s single put Dodger runners at first and third with one out. Second baseman Daniel Murphy then fielded a grounder and made an awkward flip to Tejada. When Tejada grabbed the baseball, he had his back to Utley and to first base. He had precisely no chance of turning a double play that would keep the Mets ahead. And Utley began his slide late, unless he thought second base was sitting on the lip of the outfield grass. He appeared to have one goal: to take out Tejada any way he could. And that is against the rules of baseball.

But the sport’s ethos has never been to rattle brain pans and cause rib cages to collapse. It is not football, and thank God for that. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Utley took a long shower after the game. Then he talked to the news media. “I feel terrible he was injured,” he said of Tejada, before adding: “Any time you have an opportunity to try to break up a double play you should do your best to do that.” Joe Torre, Major League Baseball’s chief baseball officer and a former All-Star himself, seemed to wrinkle his nose at that old-school guff. “It certainly was late,” Torre said of Utley’s slide. “That concerns me. ... I’m looking at it to see if anything should be done.” Even Dodgers Manager Don Mattingly had a hard time with a full-throated defense of his player. Was the slide dirty? “I don’t think we can … I don’t really … I just think we go play, be ready to play, and just deal with whatever.” This is a baseball man giving a hummina-hummina filibuster . Mets third baseman David Wright stared hard at Utley after that play. “He has injured people,” Wright said. “This isn’t something new.” Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week. Here’s the shame: This has been a tautly played playoff series. The second game began with another fine pitching matchup, Zack Greinke, a harder-throwing version of that pitching artist Tom Glavine, against Syndergaard, the blond wunderkind still in his rookie year. Syndergaard had struck out 166 batters this season and walked just 31. Sometimes, after big games, he confesses that his pulse races and his breathing quickens. His very own silent Edvard Munch scream. On the mound, though, his affect is all about implacability. He holds his glove at stomach level and stares in for a sign. Then he rears back and hurls heavy, thudding fastballs. Corey Seager, a fine-looking rookie shortstop for the Dodgers, stepped into the box in the first inning. Syndergaard’s first pitch arrived at 99 miles per hour. The last clocked in at 100 miles. How ya doing? In the second inning, Yoenis Cespedes hit an off-balance home run and Michael Conforto yanked a rocket off the right-field foul pole, the ball exiting the field so quickly it did not have time to curl foul. The impossible seemed possible. The Mets might take two wins in Los Angeles and return east with their pockets filled to overflowing with house coin. Then Greinke righted himself, moving the ball around the strike zone with a surgeon’s precision. And Utley crashed into Tejada and the Mets unraveled, with the umpires even ruling that Tejada never touched second and that Utley was safe. By the time the bottom of the seventh ended, Adrian Gonzalez had doubled to put the Dodgers ahead by two runs and Justin Turner, the red-bearded former Met, had followed with another double to make it 5-2, Dodgers. Which held up as the final score. So this series careens back to New York City, a place that on a good day comes awfully close to outlawing serenity. As Collins said of New Yorkers, which is to say us: “They are pretty excitable.” Guilty as charged, skipper. Collins also predicted his players would return a touch attitudinal. “We’ll control it, but, yeah, they’re angry,” he said. “You lose in a playoff series to that serious of an injury, yeah, they’re not very happy about it.” You hope that Matt Harvey, the next of the Mets’ strong young arms scheduled to step forward, realizes that he is of more use snapping Lord Charles curves and 98 m.p.h. fastballs in Game 3 than tossing at the cranium of some Dodger player. You also hope an old Met antagonist has not hijacked a series and taken it to a dark place.
