This is the place I want to be, here, right now.” \nLedesma said he enjoys working with Cheika, who initially brought him across to work with the Waratahs, and hoped that would continue. \nThe pair share an old-school mentality and work on a rolling basis – with no long-term contracts signed as the two trust each other’s word. \nWhen Ledesma was initially brought in to work with the Waratahs he jokes that it was as an intern on a tourist visa. \nWhen things started going well, Cheika suggested he sign a short-term deal – which led to another visa, and then a third before he was asked about fixing the Wallabies’ scrum woes before the World Cup. \n“And I’ve been going from there, every time,” he said. \nThe fruits of his labour are there for all to see, with the Australian scrum banishing their Twickenham demons on Saturday night. \nAfter years of heartache and humiliation, the Wallabies tight five turned the tables and handed out some lessons of their own – winning six scrum penalties against England’s famed pack. \nCertainly it is welcome news to Wallabies captain and hooker Stephen Moore. \n“He’s been tremendous for us as a scrum coach,” he said. \n“You pick up, when talking to him, the passion that he has for that part of the game, the knowledge he’s carried throughout his long career playing international rugby and now as a coach he’s really brought a positive contribution to the way we’re scrummaging.” \nLedesma, meanwhile, backed England loosehead prop Joe Marler to bounce back from his Twickenham horror show – where he was hooked with half an hour to go following a terse exchange with French referee Romain Poite. \nIt followed Marler conceding a fourth penalty for boring in at an angle, and highlighted a flaw in the 25-year-old’s technique – but it can be fixed, according to Ledesma. \n“He’s a very, very strong prop. He’ll be more than fine, no problem,” Ledesma said.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:24:13.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
