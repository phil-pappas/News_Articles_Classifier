Both Andy and Don Bramlett lettered for the Tigers in the mid-1980s. Also in attendance will be representatives of the University, the athletic department, the Mighty Sound of the South Marching Band and spirit squads. \nThe unveiling ceremony will be held at the corner of Early Maxwell Boulevard and Tiger Lane, adjacent to the northeast corner of the Pipkin Center. \nBull Bramlett was one of the greatest defensive players in Memphis Football history. He was a two-sport athlete, who in addition to playing linebacker, also had a stellar career at catcher for the Tigers’ baseball team. \nA speedy and intense player, Bramlett made the Memphis Football varsity squad immediately as a freshman in 1959 and became a starter midway through the year. \nDuring the 1960 campaign, Bramlett helped the Tigers improve to 8-2 and the 1961 team posted an 8-2 record as well. As a senior, Bramlett registered two pass interceptions which were returned for a total of 55 yards. The Tigers improved to 8-1 and in an important milestone, Bramlett led the defense in allowing Mississippi State to score just seven points, as Memphis State won its first game against an SEC opponent, 28-7 against the Bulldogs in Starkville, Miss. \nBramlett was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals and stayed in professional baseball for three years before signing a contract with the Denver Broncos in 1965. He was the runner-up for Rookie of the Year honors in the NFL behind quarterback Joe Namath. He played seven season for four teams in the NFL. \nFollowing his playing career, Bramlett became a lay evangelist in 1973. He spoke to hundreds of churches, schools, prisons, conventions as well as NFL and MLB chapel services prior to passing away in October of last year. \nBramlett had his jersey retired on Sept. 7, 2013 during a ceremony at the Tigers’ season opener against Duke.
