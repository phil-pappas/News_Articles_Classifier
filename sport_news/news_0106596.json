These are the moments you live for as a player,” De Bruyne said. \n“There will be a lot of atmosphere. Great games and derbies are the most important games for the fans. \n“Hopefully we can do good on Sunday.” \nMemorable contribution \nCity have won on three of their last four visits to Old Trafford, but they lost 4-2 there last season, a result United surprisingly achieved without a goal from Wayne Rooney. \nWith 11 career goals in the Manchester derby, Rooney has been a constant menace to City and the United captain, whose brilliant overhead kick to win the derby in 2011, would dearly love to mark his 30 th birthday today with another memorable contribution. \nA Rooney-inspired triumph would be especially timely as Louis van Gaal’s team will leapfrog City to the top of the table if they win and Arsenal drop points against Everton. \nAfter a dismal start to their title defence, Chelsea can only look on enviously as their rivals step up their bids to take the trophy from Stamford Bridge. \nThe Blues are languishing 10 points behind City in 12 th place after a campaign scarred by lacklustre displays, rumours of dressing room rifts and outbursts from the increasingly tetchy Jose Mourinho. \nYet Chelsea captain John Terry has seen encouraging signs in the last week following a 2-0 win over Aston Villa and a gritty goalless draw against Dynamo Kiev. \n“We are a great side and we will get there with the hunger and the ambition that is in the squad,” Terry said. \nOn Sunday, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will take charge of his first home Premier League match when Southampton visit Anfield. \nSam Allardyce is looking for his first win as Sunderland manager when arch rivals Newcastle make the short trip to the Stadium on Light. \nThe Black Cats were beaten at West Bromwich Albion in Allardyce’s first game last weekend, but they haven’t lost against Newcastle since 2011. \nFixtures (1400GMT unless stated)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:54:36.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
