(AP) - Zack Drayer threw three touchdown passes - all to Frank Failace - and St. Francis (Pa) ran away from Wagner 43-14 on Saturday. \nDrayer was 16 of 28 for 292 yards. Khairi Dickson had 161 yards rushing and a touchdown, Marcus Bagley added 126 yards and a score, and Terell Smith had six catches for 130 yards. Failace’s three touchdown receptions covered just 23 yards. \nThe Red Flash (3-2, 1-0 Northeast) scored 27 points in the second half after leading 16-7 at intermission. \nIt was a two-score game at the end of the third after Wagner’s Najee Harris blocked a punt and returned it 13 yards for a touchdown. But St. Francis scored the next 17 points, including Drayer’s 8-yard scoring pass to Failace and Bagley’s 5-yard touchdown run. \nAlex Thomson was 12 of 25 for 111 yards and a 15-yard touchdown pass to Lloyd Smith for Wagner (0-6, 0-2). \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:25:31.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
