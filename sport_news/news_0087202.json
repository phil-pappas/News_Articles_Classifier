The inside and outside walls are now completely covered at the 2.66-mile track.\nThe track initially added three sections of SAFER barrier before its May race. The barriers cost between $500-600 per foot.\nAll NASCAR tracks underwent a safety review after Kyle Busch broke his right leg and left foot in a Feb. 21 crash into a concrete wall at Daytona. All have either added SAFER barriers or said the material would be added this year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:30:11.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
