(Ronald Martinez / Getty Images) Associated Press \nTroy Tulowitzki drove in four runs, including a three-run home run for his first hit this postseason, and the Toronto Blue Jays avoided elimination in an American League division series with a 5-1 victory over the Texas Rangers in Game 3 on Sunday night. \nThe Rangers lead the best-of-five matchup, 2-1. Game 4 is Monday in Texas and Game 5, if necessary, is Wednesday in Toronto. \nMarco Estrada limited the Rangers to one run and five hits over 6 1-3 innings, with four strikeouts and no walks. \nTulowitzki's drive to left field with two outs in the sixth inning put the Blue Jays ahead, 5-0. \n\"It was definitely huge and in the moment I was definitely pumped up. Got back to the dugout and everybody's obviously excited to put us up by five,\" Tulowitzki said. \"A little breathing room, I think that's the goal down 2-0.\" \nThe home run came two innings after he drew a bases-loaded walk. Tulowitzki sat out most of the final three weeks of the regular season because of a cracked shoulder blade and bruised muscles in his upper back. \n\"Tulo needed that, he really did,\" Manager John Gibbons said. \"He had that long layoff after the injury and then it's been kind of a battle for him. Maybe that sets him off. â€¦ If he catches fire, we're real dangerous.\" \nLeft-hander Martin Perez pitched into the sixth inning and gave up four runs and six hits. \nThe Blue Jays had their leadoff hitter at second base to start each the third through fifth innings, a span that included three double plays ignited by second baseman Rougned Odor. \nToronto started the sixth with consecutive singles to chase Perez, and Edwin Encarnacion drew a 10-pitch walk from rookie reliever Chi Chi Gonzalez to load the bases before the Rangers' fourth double play in an as many innings. \nFirst baseman Mitch Moreland fielded Chris Colabello's hard-hit hopper, threw home for the first out and got back to the bag to take the return throw. \nTulowitzki, then 0 for 11 in the series, followed with his home run on a full-count pitch. \n\"He had not found the barrel until that point,\" Manager Jeff Banister said. \"Non-executed pitch.\" \nIt was only the second postseason home run in 69 postseason at-bats for Tulowitzki. The first 57 came in 15 playoff games in 2007 and 2009 for the Colorado Rockies, who traded him to Toronto on July 27. \nTulowitzki had a .179 all-time postseason batting average before the home run. He later singled. \nDioner Navarro got Toronto's first hit, a double leading off the third inning when center fielder Delino DeShields got a late break and the ball was just behind the reach of his outstretched glove. \nNavarro scored when Odor initially bobbled a grounder by Ryan Goins before reaching back with his right foot to touch the base and throwing to first base to complete the first double play. \nJosh Donaldson led off the fourth inning with a double and scored when Tulowitzki was the third consecutive batter walked by Perez. \nThe bases were still loaded in the fourth when Navarro had an inning-ending double play a pitch after a hard foul down the third base line. \nOdor made a backhanded catch with his glove just off the ground on Ben Revere's broken-bat soft liner, then doubled off Kevin Pillar, who had broken home, to end the fifth inning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:18:50.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
