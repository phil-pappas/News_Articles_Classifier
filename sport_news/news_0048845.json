But he isn't scheduled to start the National League wild-card playoff game Wednesday between the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates.\nNeither are Derek VerHagen, Zach Sawyer, Kyle Humphreys or Tony Giangiulio. All joined Thomas on the All-District 9-5A team as pitchers. You won't see them Wednesday in Pittsburgh, either. Nor will you see Tyler Engebretson, Jordan Green, Ryan Zea or Chris Smith. They were the second-team pitching selections that spring in District 9-5A.\nBut you will see the 10th-best pitcher of the district in 2004 in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.\nJake Arrieta was an honorable mention all-district 9-5A team that spring as a pitcher and third baseman at Plano East. He produced more home runs at the plate that season (3) than victories on the mound (two). That same Jake Arrieta is now a National League Cy Young favorite and the starting pitcher for the Cubs in their first playoff appearance since 2008.\nSo how does a guy go from compiling two wins pitching against the likes of Lake Highlands, McKinney, Richardson Berkner, Rockwall and the Plano schools to a major-league-leading 22 victories with a microscopic 1.77 earned run average in 2015?\n\"That's a good question,\" said Plano East baseball coach Travis Collins.\nLabel Arrieta a late bloomer.\n\"We had a kid (Aaron Pribanic) here who had an 82-83 mile-an-hour fastball,\" Collins said. \"He went to a junior college in Kansas and two years later he's throwing 91. Nebraska winds up signing him. Then he goes to Nebraska for a year, throws 93 and gets drafted by the Mariners in the third round.\n\"I looked at my assistant coach and asked, Did we miss on this kid? Was there something there that we didn't see?' He said, 'I don't think so.' You just never know how those kids are going to blossom when they leave. It's the same story with Jake -- his work ethic was solid and he just figured it out.\"\nArrieta didn't pitch much for Plano East as a junior. The Panthers had three senior pitchers who threw in the 90s on a team that reached the regional finals.\n\"Jake had an extremely rare work ethic for a high-school kid,\" Collins said. \"As a junior, he had kind of a soft body and pitched some for us. But he had some arm issues, some general soreness. But the time he spent between his junior and senior year he came back a totally different person. His body type had changed. He added a lot more lean muscle and lost some baby fat. He came back 6-4, 200 pounds. It was a nice surprise when he showed up in the fall in the shape he was in.\"\nBut Plano East was decimated by graduation. Arrieta was one of the few holdovers, and the Panthers struggled that 2004 season, finishing 11-16 overall and 5-9 in district play. Hence, the district snub in the voting by the coaches.\n\"We didn't make the playoffs that year, so to the victor go the spoils,\" Collins said. \"The more games you win, the more kids you get on the all-district team. But it is a little strange that he didn't wind up on there at all. He was our best pitcher and gave us our best chance to win. You could definitely see his talent.\"\nThe Cincinnati Reds did. They selected Arrieta in the 31st round of the 2004 draft. But he elected to continue his baseball career at Weatherford Junior College. After he won six games with a 3.58 earned run average there, the Milwaukee Brewers selected him in the 26th round of the 2005 draft. But he again passed on the pros and transferred to TCU, where he led the NCAA with 14 victories as a sophomore.\nThe Baltimore Orioles became the third team to draft Arrieta in 2007, selecting him in the fifth round, and this time he did sign. By 2012, at the age of 26, Arrieta was the opening-day starter for the Orioles. He was traded to the Cubs in 2013 and became the franchise's first pitcher in 14 years to win 20 games in 2015. He also no-hit the Dodgers, and his 0.75 ERA since the all-star break was the best in baseball history.\n\"You knew he had the tools,\" Collins said. \"He had the arm and body type, so you knew he had a chance. But a lot of times kids don't realize the work you have to put in on your own once you get out of high school. On campus here we're going to see him every day, we're going to work with him every day, make them do their weights.\n\"But to be successful from that point on, you really have to put the time in yourself and be self-driven. Jake has always been that way. It wasn't a big leap for him.\"\nMaybe not. But an October pitching mound is a very long leap from a mound at Plano East.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges, and follow @RickGosselinDMN on Twitter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RickGosselinDMN"], "published": "2015-10-06T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:31:20.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
