The freshman standout, just a year removed from Haines Middle School, shot a 69 and is bound for this weekend's Class AA state tournament in downstate Forsyth. Here's an edited transcript of Chronicle sports editor Kevin Druley's chat with Furtney: \nI heard some chatter about the pin placements at Cog Hill. What made them so tough? \nThey really placed them on slopes, so it was really hard to try to get the ball to stick close to the pin. So I learned very quickly that you needed to keep it below the pin (Monday). It was really important. \nMiddle schools don't offer competitive golf. How much does that put a premium on summer tournaments for you growing up? \nJust being able to compete in the summer, I find it so fun. And then to be able to have the opportunity to come out more competitive golf with the team over the fall, I thought it was really awesome. \nWhere is a favorite practice spot of yours? \nOh, Cantigny [in Wheaton]. ... Obviously, the course is great, and just the practice facility they have is so above and beyond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:54:20.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
