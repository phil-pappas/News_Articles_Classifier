That's the last division to be clinched. In terms of seeding, the Blue Jays and Royals are knotted at 92-67 for the top AL record while the Mets and Dodgers are tied at 89-70 with the two clubs set to square off in the NLDS round. The Cubs trail the Pirates by two games for the right to host the NL wild-card game.\nAll of that stuff is of minor interest, however, compared to the AL wild-card race. The Astros currently hold the second wild-card spot with the Angels and Twins both just one game out. The Angels are in Texas to face the Rangers, the Twins are hosting the Royals and the Astros are in Arizona.\nIt's possible the AL West champ and the two wild cards end up with the same record.\nFirst, we know if there's a tie between two teams for a spot, they play Monday for all the marbles. That's easy.\nWhat about three-way ties, though? Chaos.\nIf the Yankees and Rangers lose out while the Astros win out, all three will be 87-75. The Astros would play at Texas on Monday to determine the AL West champ. The wild-card game would then be either Yankees at Astros or Yankees at Rangers, based upon tiebreakers for home-field advantage.\nFurther, there are several scenarios that end with three teams tied for the final wild-card spot, too. Look:\nAstros: 2-1 (Final 86-76); Angels: 3-0 (Final 86-76); Twins: 3-0 (Final 86-76)\nAstros: 1-2 (Final 85-77); Angels: 2-1 (Final 85-77); Twins: 2-1 (Final 85-77)\nAstros: 0-3 (Final 84-78); Angels: 1-2 (Final 84-78); Twins: 1-2 (Final 84-78)\nIf this happens, there would be a Game 1 between teams A and B, with the winner getting team C in Game 2. The winner of Game 2 would then face the Yankees in the actual wild-card game.\nBased on the tiebreakers, the Angels would have the choice of either playing at home in Game 1 (and then Game 2 if they win) or just skipping to Game 2 but playing on the road. Presumably, they would choose to skip to Game 2, which means Game 1 would be Twins at Astros (again, based on home-field tiebreaker, which is head-to-head record among the three) with the winner hosting the Angels for the right to win the second wild card.\nIf this happens, the AL wild-card game would need to be moved. Game 1 in the above scenario would be Monday with Game 2 on Tuesday. The AL wild-card game is scheduled for Tuesday with the ALDS beginning Thursday.\nWould MLB push back the ALDS? Doubtful.\nThat would mean the wild-card game would have to be played Wednesday and the winner would have no travel day before facing the top seed Thursday.\nAnd how would they schedule the game with the NL wild-card game scheduled for Wednesday night? They wouldn't want the games to be played at the same time, but they also wouldn't want a late game.\nMy guess is they would do the NL wild-card game at something like 5 p.m. ET and the AL game (remember, Yankees equal New York ratings) at 8 p.m. ET.\nSo we would get Jake Arrieta vs. Gerrit Cole before many fans are home from work? Terrible.\nOverall, though, chaos is pretty fun. We might be headed that way. Stay tuned. Will the Astros be celebrating this weekend?
