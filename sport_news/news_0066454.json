Sending out a broken game. We should get some kind of compensation. I'm talking about at least 50k of vc for everyone. # 12 HozAndMoose @ 10/07/15 06:25 PM Quote: Originally Posted by barond57 This is unbelievable. Sending out a broken game.

Yeah & then we should all get free tickets to an NBA game of our choosing. & Ronnie should pay our rent this month. # 14 MontanaMan @ 10/07/15 06:35 PM Quote: First party certification, i.e., Microsoft and Sony. Oh ok. So we'll have a working Pro Am by Halloween maybe. # 15 rudeworld @ 10/07/15 06:39 PM Quote: Everything outside of Pro am works perfect for me. So its not that broken. Something that's \"NOT THAT BROKEN\" is still broken.... But anyway great game. # 16 WISports @ 10/07/15 07:08 PM Only things I wanna see. *Jabari's fro in the game. (can use Okafor's). Also, MCW's. *Giannis skin tone needs to be lighter (to match Jabari's). Middleton's should be darker. *Bucks road unis should be darker than what's in the game. *Bucks' court should be much lighter than it is in the game. *Fix the issue where we can't rotate the player when editing sig shots. *Tone down the thickness of some guys' legs. (Giannis, Henson, etc) # 17 BluFu @ 10/07/15 07:20 PM Quote: Only things I wanna see. *Jabari's fro in the game. (can use Okafor's).

Video games are hard to make and not everything is going to be 100% perfect. Next year, just don't buy the game at launch. It'll save you some anger. # 19 Agame @ 10/07/15 08:11 PM Any information a GAMEPLAY Patch? Will it be included with the Pro Am patch? Rebounding, Fouls, Stamina, Swing Play- where the player runs underneath the basket...waits for double screen, then cuts back for a three pointer ( He always ends up Slowing down in animation and looks like he lost his balance, EVERY play). JUST ASKING....great game though. I am sure 2k is aware of the aforementioned issues and many more that can/will be addressed.(I'm hoping). Any chance that the Classic Teams will get ReRated for each player? Several issues that if they take a look they will see instantly what needs addressed. Thanks for the update. # 20 Factzzz @ 10/07/15 08:32 PM Quote: You'd rather see skin tone changes and fro's over gameplay fixes?? Maybe he doesn't have a problem with gameplay? I know i don't, i just want to see the ability to choose sock length in MyCareer patch. As well as other accessory limitations in MyCareer, but mainly socks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:08:11.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
