The Good Big Win On The Road -And another 40 spot. I've been a fan of this team since 1975 and the most 40+ point games we've ever had in any given season is 2. And that's the entire season. We're 5 games in and we've already rung up 40 burger's(kudos to whoever used this term in the game day thread). This means this is the most prolific offense this franchise has ever had, so far. Carson Palmer -He only threw for 161 yards but he only missed with 3 passes and had 3 TD passes. Chris Johnson -Another 100 yard game for the old timer. David Johnson -2 TD's for the young timer. Andre Ellington -Nothing says welcome back like a 63 yard nail in the coffin run. Rushing Offense -191 rushing yards. Been a long time since we've seen this kind of rushing production. Defense -6 turnovers and kept Megatron in check. Can't ask for more than that. Also, Detroit had 70 passing attempts setting an NFL record and only managed 17 points, 10 of those in garbage time. The Bad Injuries -Looked like Demens, Clemons, and Okefor went off with injuries and judging by the injury thread, all 3 might be season ending. That would be a big blow to an already depleted and weak LB corp. I saw Bucannon go off with appeared to be a shoulder stinger but I think I saw him come back into the game. Drew Butler -Can he go 1 game without a punting snafu? Well, could be worse. We could have Brandon Fields. Oy, this guy makes Butler look like Ray Guy. Pass Rush -This is the only thing that scares me about this defense. This has been an issue for a few seasons now. We need a pass rush plain and simple. Thank God Stafford thought he was a Cardinal today or this game could have turned another direction. The Ugly No real ugly's about this game. However, I was at the Philly/New Orleans game and man are the Saints horrible. That's it for now. \"Begin with the end in mind and die empty.\" -A-Dub #35", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:53:30.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
