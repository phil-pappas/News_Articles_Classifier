Rick Bamman - hbamman@shawmedia.com Bears Eddie Royal tries to elude the grasp of Arizona's Rashad Johnson in the first half on Sunday, September 20, 2015 at Soldier Field in Chicago. — H. Rick Bamman \nLAKE FOREST — The Bears seemed to get some good news across the board at wide receiver at Thursday's practice, starting with their top receiver. \n“I feel a lot better than last week,” Alshon Jeffery said. \nJeffery was limited for the second day in a row and is still taking his recovery from a hamstring injury one day at a time. He is not worried about being a different player when he does return. \n“I’m still the same player. I’m not going to change,” he said. “Injuries are a part of the game, but when you get back you are still the same player.” \nAdam Gase has been pleased with what he’s seen from the offense the past few weeks without its top receiver, but looks forward to what it could be with Jeffery on the field. \n“I think we’re going to be able to open things up a bit,” he said. “We haven’t really been able to attack down the field. … I know Alshon is a special cat. The way that he goes up and gets the ball, it’s rare to see. I know there’s a few guys that can do it, but it seems like a contested throw, he wins a lot. \n“Like [wide receivers coach Mike] Groh always would say, ‘He’s an above-the-rim player,’ and there’s not a lot of those guys around the league.” \nJay Cutler knows that Jeffery's return, whether this week or after the bye, should take some pressure off a group of young receivers that has stepped up late in the past two games. \n\"The last four or five weeks with these other guys kind of floating in and out of the lineup and getting a lot of reps at practice, we’ve got a lot of confidence in a lot of guys, all the way down the line,\" he said. \"When Alshon does get back, it will take a load off of some of those guys. But we’ll also be able to stay fresh and rotate guys in like you said.” \nEddie Royal (ankle) practiced Thursday for the first time since suffering the injury in Week Four. He was limited. \n“Eddie is a guy that some of our coaching staff has had experience with, including myself,” Fox said. “He’s proven to be an accomplished All-Pro wide receiver. We brought him to be a slot and we’ve had a couple of injuries, which have been fairly well documented. I know we’re better with him than without him.” \nThe other big-name receiver on the Bears was spotted at practice, too, on Thursday. Kevin White was present on the field in the portion open to the media for the first time since he underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in August. White is eligible to begin practicing next week, but still is not expected to return any time soon. \n“They are continuing to rehab,” Fox said. “The training staff, they’ve been doing a lot of indoor work. Now he’s progressing to where he can get on the grass a little bit. He’s not been activated. He’s still reserve PUP.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:58:28.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
