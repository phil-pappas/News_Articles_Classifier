The SunDevils led 14-0 after one quarter, and 28-7 late in the first half, thanks to two touchdown runs each from Malik Butts and Davonte Williams.\nThen, as a heavy fog fell over the field, Kellam (2-5) stormed back. A 10-yard run from Tyree Thorpe made it 28-14 at the half.\nKody Elmer - who finished with 222 rushing yards - scored from 22 yards out less than a minute into the third quarter. A Danny Antonelli field goal minutes later cut Salem's lead to 28-24.\nSalem answered, as Butts scored from 10 yards for a 34-24 edge. But Kellam responded early in the fourth quarter on a 7-yard run from Elmer.\nKellam had two late chances to score again. With 3:22 left, Salem stuffed Elmer on a fourth-and-2 run from the Salem 22.\nAfter the SunDevils punted with just over a minute left, Kellam took over at its own 37. Three completions by Justin Glasier moved the Knights to the Salem 11.\nAfter a timeout, Glasier faced heavy pressure and threw high and through the end zone on the final play.\nJackson said he gave his defense simple instructions during the last timeout. He reminded the players Kellam had to go to the end zone.\n\"Just play, and don't give up anything,\" he added.\nJackson credited Kellam with exposing holes in his defense. The Knights piled up more than 400 total yards.\nKellam coach Chris DeWitt felt his team played well enough to win.\n\"I'm proud as heck of our kids,\" he said.\nAfterward, Jackson took photos with his team on the field, celebrating his victory. Balloons in the background made up the number 100.\nBut Jackson said that milestone simply means he has had good coaches and players along the way.\n\"I take no credit for that,\" he said.\nMike Connors, 757-222-5217, michael.connors@pilotonline.com\nRobert Jackson shared credit for his 100th win with his assistants and players.
