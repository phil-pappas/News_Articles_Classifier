It's early days, not late May. Our target is to play good football, to be solid, defend and attack with numbers and keep the ball, score more goals and get more points. Where we will finish, I don't know! But it should be good.\" \nDefeat was harsh on Palace but manager Alan Pardew tried to look on the bright side. \n\"The resilience we showed in the second half, down to 10 men, was a good sign,\" he said. \"At some point it will happen to us - a team will go down to 10 men and we will have to exploit it like West Ham did to us.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:22:47.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
