It was batting practice for boxing’s potential next big thing.\n“Today, he went to school,” Golovkin said of Lemieux. “Boxing school. Different class.”\nThere was little doubt about that from the night-long drilling Golovkin gave Lemieux with his jab right up to the moment referee Steve Willis stopped the assault at 1:32 of the eighth round with Lemieux cowering on the ropes, his gloves pinned to his ears far too late to protect his bloody and bruised face from a painful night at the Golovkin Academy of Assault and Battery.\nKnown for carrying a powerful punch into the ring with him, Lemieux (34-3, 31 KO) was the perfect foil for the undefeated Golovkin (34-0, 31 KO), whose 92 percent knockout ratio and 21 straight stoppages were warnings to the public of what was to come. In front of him was a one-dimensional fighter who couldn’t throw a straight punch if his life depended on it.\nAgainst such looping assaults, the well-schooled former Olympic gold medalist showed all his many gifts as well as the value of a good education in the art of bruising. With over 300 amateur fights and 33 professional ones, Golovkin long ago learned his trade while Lemieux proved to be an apprentice about to experience a harsh graduate course in the dark art of boxing.\nExpecting a toe-to-toe brawl, Lemieux ate jab after jab, 170 of them in all. They blunted his efforts to engage, altering his appearance by the end with a bloody nose and mouth and plum-colored bruises around his right eye. They also snapped his head back time and again, the thin strands of hair that run down the middle of his head repeatedly flying into the air before a crowd of 20,548.\n“He got me with that jab,” Lemieux admitted. “He was very effective tonight. I feel like I waited too long to take some shots tonight, and that really hurt me.”\nIf Lemieux meant he waited too long to take some chances he was correct, but he was taking shots from the opening bell until Willis jumped in after having stopped the fight earlier to have a ringside physician check on the soon-to-become former IBF champion’s face and wellbeing.\n“Against a guy (Golovkin) like that he was going to get really hurt and I’m here to protect the fighters’ health,” said Willis. “That’s my top priority. I couldn’t let him continue to receive punishment. I gave him every chance I could and I still hesitated too much. It was over.”\nWillis was right in his assessment, both of the situation and his decision, putting the lie to Lemieux’s later claim that the fight was stopped too soon. Too soon? It should have been stopped the day the match was made.\n“David presented a target Gennady could use the jab on,” Golovkin’s trainer, Abel Sanchez, said. “It was easy for him. That’s the best I’ve seen it in a real fight but I see it in the gym all the time.\n“Gennady needed someone he thought was a mental threat to him. Not so much a physical threat but a perceived threat.”\nThat is exactly what Lemieux proved to be. The event was well promoted by Golovkin’s promoter, Tom Loeffler, who convinced both the public and much of the boxing media that Lemieux was a big puncher who was a danger to Golovkin. The truth was, as it always is in boxing, that it doesn’t matter how many knockouts you have. The issue is who are you knocking out?\nLemieux had lost to the two best fighters he’d faced, one of whom Golovkin destroyed in two rounds. Competitive match? Please.\nThe win leaves Golovkin with the winner of the Miguel Cotto-Canelo Alvarez WBC title fight in November directly in his crosshairs. The winner has 15 days to agree to face Golovkin in another unification fight or be stripped of the title and have it awarded to Golovkin.\nWhat the winner chooses to do is up to him. Either would be a far bigger test than David Lemieux posed, but as Lemieux learned Saturday night, if you’re going to pursue Golovkin you best proceed with caution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:54:02.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
