But don’t tell either club that. \nBoth squads were supposed to be one year away from seriously competing for a title, but both are now playing with house money as both squads are one win away from playing in their respective division championship series. \nThe Astros’ run sort of feels like the Royals’ march to the World Series last year. Not much was expected of the Royals last year when they pulled off a miraculous win in the wild card game. \nBut Kansas City became a team everyone was rooting for, and it took advantage of the moment by playing loose and stress free. \nThe Astros are playing that way this year. They have an ace who is fearless and two of the better prospects in the game in George Springer and Carlos Correa. It always takes a few unsung heroes to make a serious run, and Colby Rasmus has been that guy so far for Houston. He is tearing the cover off the ball. \nSpeaking of aces, there hasn’t been anyone better in the second half of the season than Chicago star Jake Arrieta. And the moment doesn’t appear to be too high for rookies Kris Bryant, Addison Russell, Jorge Soler and Kyle Schwarber. \nThrow in Anthony Rizzo and the resurgence of Dexter Fowler and the Cubs might just have enough talent to dethrone the mighty Cardinals. \nI grew up a Reds fan so nothing makes me more happy than seeing the Cardinals and Cubs struggle. \nHowever, when the two go head-to-head, I’d rather see the Cubs come out on top. \nI thought the ALCS would feature Toronto and Kansas City, and the Blue Jays were my World Series pick. \nBoth squads will be in a winner-take-all Game 5 though after staving off elimination on Monday. \nIn the NL, I had the Dodgers facing the Cardinals in the NLCS. The Mets and Cubs stole home field advantage though. \nNow it’s up to the favorites to get back an advantage with a road win of their own. \nI didn’t think Major League Baseball handled the Chase Utley situation very well. \nI don’t agree with the suspension. \nTo me, he is a making a baseball play trying to break up the double play. \nIt was a vicious hit, but Utley isn’t the first player to cause an injury during a slide into second base. \nThere is no precedence for the act, and I thought it was the wrong decision to suspend him. \nI don’t think Utley intended to break Ruben Tejada’s leg. I think he most definitely meant to go in hard and break up a double play. The situation was magnified because of the injury and because New York Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson ridiculed MLB for not taking a bigger stand. \nUtley is appealing the suspension, and I imagine MLB will reduce it to one game. It barely matters. Utley is a hitting .202 this year and is way beyond his prime. But no other player has been suspended for injuring someone while sliding into second base. \nChris Coghlan wasn’t when his slide into second base, to also break up a double play, resulted in a broken leg for Pittsburgh’s Jung Ho Kang. \nI think Utley should have been called out for not touching the base. The umps are more at fault in this particular instance. Utley did what everyone was taught to do at a young age. It’s the umpire’s job to make the right call. \nI expect Utley to get a ball to the ribs if and when he plays next against the Mets. That’s just what baseball is. Players police themselves. And that’s fine. Utley probably knows it’s coming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:49:03.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
