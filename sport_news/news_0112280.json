Detroit found little room on ice to work with against the young group scoring a lone goal to lose 3-1 at Rexall Place Wednesday night. The defeat became their third in a row while the Oilers gained their third straight victory.\nDetroit’s two game skid needed to come to an end as they moved west to face the Edmonton Oilers and new first round draft pick Connor McDavid . McDavid has been helping his team in great ways lately scoring three goals over six games. With him and the other four first round picks, Edmonton would try to increase their winning streak to three games.\nIt becomes a pinnacle point for another rising star in the NHL as Dylan Larkin has contributed to Detroit’s four victories scoring two goals and four assists. Though the team finds themselves in the hole, Detroit hopes that they can get back in right direction and make the battle of the rookies one to remember.\nThe Oilers blasted out at the Detroit net trying to gain the edge early in the first period. Edmonton record four shots in the first five minutes getting close to putting one in the net. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins nearly got one behind goaltender Petr Mrazek but was denied by the glove.\nThe Red Wings allowed Edmonton to fire six shots including a power play that they killed off with strong special teams. Once their time came to be on the advantage, Detroit started getting shots at Cam Talbot in net for the Oilers. A scoring chance nearly put them on the board, but at the end of the penalty they managed just two shots on net.\nDetroit put the Oilers back on the power play where they wasted no time making the two-minute advantage count. A great play between Nail Yakupov and Mark Letestu worked out as the centerman shot on the pass to score his first of the season. The lead for Edmonton didn’t yet light a fire under the Red Wings as they generated three shots since the end of their first power play. The Oilers eased their way playing on the penalty kill for a second time shutting down Detroit. They ended the first period outshooting the Red Wings 11-5 while holding the lead over their heads.\nDetroit opened the second with a chance on the power play, but much like the first pair, it failed to make dividends for them. The Oilers were then rewarded their chance to be successful on the power play. They were stopped by the Red Wings who showed improvement on special teams holding their ground. After a brief 4 on 4, the Oilers turned on the jets stealing the puck in the neutral zone.\nEdmonton skated hard into the Red Wings zone where Benoit Pouliot had McDavid alongside setting him up to score his fourth goal moving the puck around Mrazek. Another turnover by the Red Wings gave Teddy Purcell a shot on net that went off the pad of Mrazek before Anton Lander scored on the rebound to make it 3-0. The wheels were clearing coming off Detroit’s overall gameplay as they were being ousted in the second period with barely anything to show for it.\nThe period came to an end after the final 13 minutes went into the books as the Red Wings took 11 shots on net looking desperate to get on the board. With just twenty more minutes to make something from very little. Detroit required a serious overhaul to come back from three goals down.\nThe Red Wings came into the third still looking sluggish in their quest to fight back against the young Oilers team. After six minutes, positive signs were showing for Detroit as they started to move the game into the Edmonton zone. Gustav Nyquist was the Red Wings hottest shooter of the night, using his power to fire shots to the net. His second recorded shot went off the pads of Talbot only to arrive near the stick of Tomas Tatar who backhanded a shot to score his first of the season ending the shutout.\nIt was the only goal they would score on the night despite having six chances on the power play. They kept Mrazek out of the net for the remaining three minutes of regulation that clearly made no difference to the overall outcome. Though Detroit outshot the Oilers in the end, the two-goal deficit was too much for them to come back from as they accepted their third loss in a row while the Oilers won their third. Talbot was the hero of the night stopping 28 shots by Detroit with a .955 save percentage.\nMrazek faced his second loss this season as he was left to deal with some serious heat by Edmonton who came out like a storm. With Thursday left to travel into Calgary, the Red Wings will try to make a difference to their woes before starting a back to back going into the weekend.", "external_links": ["http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8478402", "http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/boxscore?id=2015020090"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:08:46.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
