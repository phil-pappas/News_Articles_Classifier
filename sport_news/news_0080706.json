Mike Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation.\nNugent was good again from 42 yards with 3:36 left in overtime, the ball deflecting off the left upright before going through. It matched the second-biggest comeback in Cincinnati's history when trailing in the fourth quarter.\nThe Bengals are 5-0 for the first time since 1988, the last time they went to the Super Bowl.\nSeattle (2-3) punted twice in overtime, giving the Bengals a chance to pull it out.\n___\nOnline: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
