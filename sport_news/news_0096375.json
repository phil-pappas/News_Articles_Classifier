Going into league winning three in a row, the kids are all excited. And they’re believing.” \nSince opening the season with back-to-back losses, the Seahawks have reeled off three straight wins and take a 3-2 clip into their Golden West League opener against Westminster (4-0) next week. \nOcean View lost to the Lions last season and have not forgotten about the result. \n“There’s no way we’re not ready for next week,” Nunez added. “(Westminster) is our rival. Beating them has been one of our team goals all year, and it’s here again. So a little redemption from last year, that’s what’s been driving us all summer.” \nThe Seahawks reclaimed a 14-7 lead with 5:46 to go in the fourth when quarterback Blake Meyer capped a 13-play, 74-yard drive with a 2-yard sneak for his second rushing score of the night. \nEstancia (1-4) responded with its own 10-play drive that covered 72 yards. Like he did in the first half, Brown connected with his brother, Trevor , for the 12-yard touchdown strike. \n“I wanted to go for the win,” Bargas said of his decision. “Take the gamble and see if we’re ready to rally.” \nContact the writer: kconnolly@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:09:29.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
