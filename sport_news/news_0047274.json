The superstar has received a lot of publicity for cheating and being reprimanded; not for scoring goals and dominating matches. Chelsea is off to their worst start in 37 years, a season in which they experienced relegation. \nDiego Costa is somewhat taking ownership for his role in Chelsea’s failures, by admitting he’s overweight and out of shape. \n“I’m going to be very honest: Maybe a few weeks ago, five or six weeks ago, I was not on top of my game. At least physically,” Costa is quoted in the Daily Mail. \n“I got injured at the end of the season and then I went on holiday. Maybe I got out of my diet and when I came back I was not the way I was supposed to be. I was a little bit overweight, and that affected my game.” \n“I’m responsible 100 percent, and so are the other guys. So all we can do now is train very hard and work very hard to try to get back to that level where we were the season before,” Diego Costa, a man who normally doesn’t like to do interviews, told the media. \nChelsea are currently in 16th place, just ahead of the drop zone, and there’s been speculation about the job security of Manager Jose Mourinho. \nPaul M.
