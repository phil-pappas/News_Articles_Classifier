She is a Wal-Mart heiress who, according to Forbes, is worth an estimated $4.6 billion.\nThe Nuggets and the Avalanche will be run by the Kroenkes' son, Josh.\nUnder league rules, an owner cannot own an NFL team in one city and another pro sports franchise in another NFL city (or potential NFL city, such as Los Angeles). The reason is, the league doesn't want NFL owners competing with each other for sports/entertainment dollars in the same city.\nFor those reading tea leaves on the L.A. situation, the fact that Kroenke got the thumbs-up is noteworthy because his cross-ownership situation had been viewed as an irritant among some owners. With that behind him, it removes one of the hurdles in his path to a potential relocation to L.A.\nNFL team owners Kroenke and Dean Spanos discussed potential Southern California stadium locations -- including the site of the Hollywood Park racetrack in Inglewood -- over dinner in 2013, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting.\nThe report of the exchange, which the source described as \"very amicable,\" sheds new light on the long-running competition to return the NFL to Los Angeles, as league owners discuss possible relocation of one or more teams during their fall meetings here at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.\nNo votes are expected at this meeting or during a scheduled owners gathering in December, as they continue to discuss how to resolve a complex situation that includes two stadium plans for L.A. and three home markets hoping to retain their franchises.\nKroenke, who owns the St. Louis Rams, and Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, back competing proposals that offer starkly different visions to end the league's two-decade absence from Los Angeles.\nKroenke's proposal includes a domed stadium and an artificial playing surface in Inglewood. Spanos, who has teamed with the Oakland Raiders, has put forward an open-air, natural-grass facility adjacent to the 405 Freeway in Carson.\nThe idea of Kroenke and Spanos teaming up in Inglewood has been suggested as a solution to the conundrum, but nothing has come of previous discussions involving the site.\nThe Chargers, for example, had no interest in purchasing a 60-acre parcel of land owned by Wal-Mart on the periphery of the Hollywood Park site.\nKroenke bought the parcel, which isn't large enough to be the site of a stadium on its own -- in January 2014 and partnered with Stockbridge Capital, which controls the site's remaining 238 acres, to propose a facility.\nThe Chargers and Stockbridge Capital had multiple phone conversations about the Hollywood Park site before the company's deal with Kroenke, as part of the team's wide-ranging effort to find a stadium solution after years of fruitless negotiations in San Diego. The conversations never developed into something more.\nNational Car Rental secured the naming rights to the proposed riverfront stadium in St. Louis on Wednesday, pledging $158 million over 20 years. The agreement hinges on an NFL team -- the city is fighting to keep the Rams -- playing in the venue.\nThe move wasn't well-received by some in the NFL, however. They were puzzled that the deal was announced while league owners were meeting and didn't view the $7.9 million per year accord as particularly lucrative.\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones jabbed the deal in a conversation with the Sports Business Journal, saying the amount \"would buy a lobby\" in an L.A. stadium.\nThe last time naming rights were sold for a proposed NFL stadium, Farmers Insurance pledged $700 million over 20 years for AEG's project in downtown L.A.\nAEG abandoned the project -- known as Farmers Field -- earlier this year.\nNeither of the current proposed stadiums in L.A. has sold naming rights.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1734160&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1734160", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1734160&h=NFL+approves+cross+ownership+plan+of+Rams+owner+Stan+Kroenke"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:15:14.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
