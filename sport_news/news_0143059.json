I think I was just using the conditions a little bit better today, and maybe that's why the score was like that,\" she said of her victory. \n\"Coming to Asia I didn't really think I had any chance to go to Singapore and it's actually been a very good couple of weeks for me. \n\"Winning Tokyo gave me some chances to go there and then every match started to matter after that, and I knew if I won here I would make it there. \n\"But the pressure didn't feel too big. I could really play my best tennis in Tianjin this week.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:22:00.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
