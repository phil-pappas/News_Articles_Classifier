Rebilas/USA TODAY Sports) 26 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFormer Ball State receiver Willie Snead appears to have found his stride in the NFL. \nHe led the Saints with 141 receiving yards on six receptions this week when they played the Eagles. Snead leads the team in receiving yards with 381 on the season. \nTo put that in perspective, Drew Brees has thrown for 1,304 yards this season. Which means Snead has been on the receiving end of nearly 30 percent of those yards. He’s been targeted 33 times, second on the team to Brandin Cooks, which is why he’s making headlines in the fantasy football world. \nHe’s been featured as a go-to waiver wire pickup by ESPN, NFL.com and Bleacher Report. We're live: the Week 6 @ESPNFantasy waiver wire column is up.
