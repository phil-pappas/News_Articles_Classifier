Not yet. If the Golden Eagles could somehow win their next three region games, a 3-3 record in region play would probably secure the final playoff spot. That’s a big if, however with Cullman, Florence and Austin standing in their way. A loss would mathematically eliminate Athens from playoff contention. \nPreview: Despite back-to-back shutouts, the Athens offense has the potential to move the ball. It just hasn’t translated to points this season. It won’t get any easier Friday against a Cullman team giving up just 16 points per game. However, most of the points were surrendered in the Bearcats’ two-region contests. \nPlayers to watch: John Bachus, quarterback, Athens. Bachus can throw a pretty deep ball and is among the state’s leaders in passing yards. Bachus and Athens need success early to keep the crowd in the game. \nSeries history: Athens leads 30-22, with one tie. \nLast meeting: Cullman won 28-7. \nNews Courier prediction: Cullman 30, Athens 13 \nRogers (4-1, 2-1) at West Limestone (2-3, 1-2) \nJames Kennemer Stadium, Lester \nPreview: It’s a new season for West Limestone, or at least that’s what the Wildcats hope after starting with a 2-3 record. They welcome a much-improved Rogers team riding a three-game winning streak. West Limestone beat Rogers 23-10 last season to snap a five-game winning streak. A win would put the Wildcats back in the 4A playoff race. A loss would force West to win all its remaining region games to make the postseason. West Limestone is going for its third straight win in the series. Rogers won six straight before that. \nSeries history: Rogers lead 17-7 with one tie. \nLast meeting: West Limestone won 23-10. \nNews Courier prediction: West Limestone 22, Rogers 14 \nEast Limestone (4-1, 3-0) at Russellville (4-1, 3-0) \nTigers Stadium, Russellville \nPreview: East Limestone travels to Russellville where the Indians will try to leave with their first victory at Tigers Stadium. East hung on to beat Russellville last season in a game that decided the region championship. The region title could very well turn out to be the difference again with both teams tied for first in 5A Region 8. Russellville’s offense has scored at least 29 points in every game this season. The Tigers suffered their first loss in a 39-36 defeat at Sparkman last week. \nSeries history: Russellville leads 5-2. \nLast meeting: East Limestone won 21-14. \nNews Courier prediction: Russellville 25, East Limestone 20 \nSt. John Paul II Catholic (0-5, 0-3) at Ardmore (2-3, 0-3) \nCooper Field, Ardmore \nPreview: Ardmore dominated Clements in all three phases last week in a 29-6 victory and will hope to do the same when the Tigers return to region play this week against St. John Paul II Catholic. Catholic has surrendered at last 40 points in every game this season while Ardmore has averaged 31 points in two victories. The Ardmore ground game should be too much for the Falcons to overcome. \nSeries history: Ardmore leads 3-0. \nLast meeting: Ardmore won 41-35. \nNews Courier prediction: Ardmore 42, Catholic 14 \nClements (0-5, 0-3) at Colbert County (2-3, 1-2) \nC.T. Manley Stadium, Leighton \nPreview: The road gets no easier for Clements this week as the Colts travel to Colbert County for a 3A Region 8 contest. Colbert County has played the who’s who of small school football so far in 2015. The Indians have faced 2A No. 2 Tanner, 3A No. 1 Madison Academy and a pair of ranked 3A teams in Deshler and Lauderdale County. Clements is still searching for its first win of the season after coming up short at Ardmore last week. \nSeries history: Colbert County leads 6-1. \nLast meeting: Colbert County won 63-6. \nNews Courier prediction: Colbert County 48, Clements 13 \nTanner (6-0, 3-0) at Tarrant (1-4, 1-1) \nWildcats Field, Fultondale \nPreview: These teams combined for 100 points last season and while there might not be that many points this time around, it’s only because Tanner will pull its starters in the third quarter. The Rattlers have been able to name their score in region play so far in 2015 and this one should be no different. Tarrant lost to a Sumiton Christian team that Tanner beat 55-7 two weeks ago. Tanner is averaging 57 points against 2A teams this season. \nSeries history: Tanner leads 1-0. \nLast meeting: Tanner won 77-33. \nNews Courier prediction: Tanner 51, Tarrant 12 \nJames Clemens (4-1, 2-1) at Grissom (0-5, 0-3) \nMilton Frank Stadium, Huntsville \nPreview: No. 3 James Clemens has staked a claim as the top team in the state of Alabama, despite a 27-24 loss to No. 2 Bob Jones last month. The Jets are a complete team that should have no problem against a Grissom team that’s been outscored 126-14 in region play this season. \nSeries history: James Clemens leads 1-0. \nLast meeting: James Clemens won 56-18. \nNews Courier prediction: James Clemens 49, Grissom 0 \nCentral (2-3, 1-2) at Elkmont (0-5, 0-3) \nBoss Hill Stadium, Elkmont \nPreview: These two teams met in Florence last season with first place in 4A Region 8 on the line. It’s been a different story for both in 2015. Central has dropped three straight after two convincing wins to start the season. The Wildcats still have playoff aspirations and could play West Limestone on Oct. 16 for the final region playoff slot. \nSeries history: Central leads 4-1. \nLast meeting: Elkmont won 31-7. \nNews Courier prediction: Central 33, Elkmont 20 Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:33.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
