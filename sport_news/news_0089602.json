Pittsburgh kicker Josh Scobee had two chances to give the Steelers some cushion late in the fourth quarter but pulled both kicks wide left. The second miss gave the Ravens (1-3) enough time to put Scobee well within range to send the game to an extra period. Pittsburgh (2-2) then twice went for it on fourth down in Baltimore territory in overtime rather than send Scobee out for a long attempt into the wind at the open end of Heinz Field. Michael Vick, starting in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger, was stopped on fourth-and-2 at the 39 and later overthrew Antonio Brown on fourth-and-1 from the 33. Neither Vick nor Scobee would get a third shot. Joe Flacco led the Ravens to the 35, and Tucker’s winner was never in doubt. Justin Forsett ran for 150 yards for the Ravens. Flacco threw a touchdown pass and did just enough late to help Baltimore end the worst start in franchise history. Vick threw for 124 yards and a score, and Le’Veon Bell ran for 129 yards and a touchdown for the Steelers. JETS LEAVE TWO HOME Guard Willie Colon, who has a sprained knee, and tight end Jeff Cumberland, who is following the N.F.L. protocol for a concussion, did not accompany the Jets on Thursday when the team flew to London for Sunday’s game against the Miami Dolphins. Receiver Eric Decker’s status is uncertain after he missed last Sunday’s loss to the Philadelphia Eagles with a knee injury. He practiced on limited basis.
