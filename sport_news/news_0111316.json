Lines which later developed into great tangle of letters, realistic scenes, caricatures or freestyle. “Back in 99, I was really interested in all things interesting. I was fascinated by calligraphy and dabbled in live paintings,” he recalls, while in city, on an invitation by Alliance Francaise de Chandigarh, to undertake a workshop of light painting and co-creation of a mural with local graffiti artists. Initially influenced by American styles, the French graffiti and light paint artist quickly forged his own identity with the discovery of Arabic calligraphy. And with the calligraffisme, emerged the abstract style which mixes calligraphy, urbanity and spontaneity. “It was only after my initial interests that I graduated to live graffiti. Once the response from people was phenomenal.” Since graffiti was a means of expression, he mastered all the possible techniques. Today graffiti and his other artistic expressions find reference to the times when the hip hop movement emerged and anchored rapidly on the outskirts of major cities. That was the era of the walls of cities, vague spaces, railway tracks where he places his paintings, sprays and delivers slices of life in the suburb he occupied at the time. As for light painting, he shares, “I don’t practice all that much but I make it spontaneous, working on people who are up for light painting and actually borrowing from the unique parts of their personality. Whatever it be, the dress, the accessories, the background.” Finding spaces\nThe early 2000s marked yet another turning point, as he adapts a photographic process for capturing the movements of light. “This is the light painting,” he gets started as he explains and exhibits the unique process of painting live spaces, borrowing from people, elements and live spaces. Finding space in the world’s top street art and graffiti artists hasn’t been easy. It’s time much of the street art found its due in art galleries. Meanwhile, it’s his third time in India. “I have been here before in 2009, followed by 2010 and now. After this I move to Delhi and then to Kolkata.” The world is a platform now, as he shuttles among artistic residences, collaborations, wall interventions, video light painting, workshop facilitations... all along sowing his unique aesthetic and illuminating sensitivity around the world. The co-creation of mural with local graffiti artists to happen on October 26 at 9am at Alliance Francaise—36, Chandigarh. manpriya@tribunemail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:09:10.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
