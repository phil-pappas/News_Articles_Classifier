He missed nearly two years and needed four operations after tearing cruciate ligaments in 2012 and again in 2013 before returning for the 2014-15 season. He then tore a tendon in his thigh and was sidelined for another five months before making his comeback in Bayern's 8-0 rout of Hamburger SV on Feb. 14. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:58:07.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
