The Bruins had to take a road trip this week, whether they were booed as they left the ice after Monday's 6-3 loss to the Lightning at TD Garden or not. It's still a pretty opportune time to get out of town, though. At 0-3-0 with the worst-in-the-NHL 16 goals-against after a season-opening homestand, the Bruins were, in fact, somewhat eager to depart on Tuesday afternoon for games at Colorado (10:05 p.m. on Wednesday) and Arizona (10:05 on Saturday), although not necessarily to escape the criticism that has accompanied their poor start. \"I think it's going to be big for our team,\"said winger Jimmy Hayes, who is seeking his first point (and second shot on goal) as a Bruin. \"We'll be around each other more, get to know each other more and more. \"It's early in the season, but we want to get results. So it's a big road trip for us as a team for getting wins, and getting more comfortable with one another.\" Recent Bruins teams haven't been so dependent on the bonding aspect of the road, with roster turnover relatively low from year to year. The group that departed on Tuesday, on the other hand, included eight players in their first full year in the organization. Six — forwards Hayes, Matt Beleskey, Joonas Kemmpainen, and Zac Rinaldo, defenseman Colin Miller and goalie Jonas Gustavsson — played for other teams for all of 2014-15, while two others (Brett Connolly, Max Talbot) were acquired in trades late last year. \"I think it is a good time to spend a lot of time together,\"said winger Brad Marchand, who will travel with the team as he recovers from a concussion. \"It could be a great time for us to get away and be by ourselves for a bit, just have some bonding opportunity. \"Throughout (training) camp, being at home all the time, it's different. Some guys have families, different things going on.\" The Bruins' 2015 camp, in fact, offered fewer get-to-know-you opportunities than others. The approximately 60 players on hand were broken into three groups until cuts started coming, so many players didn't see or skate with each other often. None of the three preseason road games (Detroit, New York Rangers, Washington) even involved an overnight stay. This trip, with two days in between games, offers personal and practice opportunities. Coach Claude Julien welcomes both, and likes the idea that \"a lot of times, a good portion of your focus is on winning hockey games. We're hoping our team takes advantage of that.\" As much as a new lineup, injuries to key veteran defensemen Zdeno Chara (since returned) and Dennis Seidenberg, No. 1 goalie Tuukka Rask's slow start (4.72 goals-against average, .846 saves percentage) and other personnel-related factors have contributed to the Bruins' worst start since 1999-2000. In-game focus has also been an issue. The B's have given up goals in the worst possible ways, at the worst possible times — in bunches, as soon as they've scored one of their or own, very early or late in periods. \"This is where we've got to get better,\"Julien said. \"That's an area that's a mental thing. We've just got to overcome that.\" They weren't able to do that in three games at the Garden, so the hope is that they'll learn to do it on the road. \"I think for us to get on the road, and kind of bond as a team — kind of start fresh — is going to be good,\" said center Ryan Spooner. \"It's not really going to help to look back at the past three games and dwell on that. It's better to focus on what's ahead of us.\" AROUND THE BOARDS: Marchand, concussed late in Saturday's 4-2 loss to the Canadiens, skated and shot before Tuesday's practice, during which he participated in a green, no-contact jersey. \"I felt great,\"Marchand said. \"I'm just practicing with the team, no contact, and we'll take it from there. Whatever the doctors tell me to do, I'm going to do.\"… Defenseman Joe Morrow, whom Julien said was \"battling the flu,\" was placed on Injured Reserve on Tuesday. The B's recalled Tommy Cross, a fourth-year pro who hasn’t played an NHL game yet, from Providence in the AHL.
