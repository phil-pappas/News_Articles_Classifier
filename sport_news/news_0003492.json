The 5-foot-9, 190-pound senior, who doubles at cornerback and returns kicks, has carried 15 times for 104 yards. \nIn last Saturday's 27-24 nonleague loss to Archbishop Wood, Rinella helped spark a third-quarter rally with a 25-yard scoring grab. His 18-yard run set up quarterback Chris Ferguson's TD keeper. \nRinella, who been laser-timed at 4.6 seconds in the 40-yard dash, has drawn interest from Bucknell, Dayton, Duquesne, Holy Cross, Lehigh, Marist, and Stetson.
