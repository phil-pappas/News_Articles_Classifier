Montpelier's back line of Anisa Venner-Johnston, Amber Pagani, Grace Carlomagno and Jordan Allen-Brandon was under attack from start to finish and had to be exhausted from all of the penalty corner sprints. \n\"My front line is relentless, but we need to work on getting it in the net. To some extent, they like to pass too much,\" noted coach Coursen. \nLeia Robinson and Reagan Baldasaro each excited the crowd with long rallies, while Abbe Cravinho and Molly Kelly made a beautiful dishes early in the first half. Molly Kelly threatened often, but was denied from point-blank range and later on a couple of breakaways. \nAly Bashaw, Averie Lowe and Emily Stoddard all did a nice job of keeping the ball in the Montpelier zone. On BF's seventh corner of the game, Madison Streeter passed the ball up top to Stoddard, whose blast was kicked away by Bashara before Cravinho was able to bury her rebound attempt with 1:14 left before the break. Advertisement \nBellows Falls goalie Brigid Hodsden was never tested. She had a good view of forwards Cravinho, Baldasaro, Robinson and Hannah Kelly passing and pressuring the Solons for the entire second half. \nHannah Kelly made it 2-0 with 18:17 remaining, when she took a nice entry pass from Cravinho and beat Basharo one-on-one. And Robinson capped the scoring six minutes later, when she cleaned up on a Hannah Kelly laser that was deflected by the Montpelier goalie. \nBellows Falls, which improved to 11-2-2, will face No. 4 Missisquoi Valley (5-7-3) in Wednesday's semifinal in Manchester at 3:45 p.m. Second-seeded Stowe and No. 3 Lyndon will square off on the other side of the bracket.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:50:37.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
