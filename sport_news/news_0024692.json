Ehlinger completed 21 of 25 pass attempts for 369 yards and had 55 yards on 10 carries on the ground with 7 total touchdowns.\nThe Chaparrals have struggled getting started in the first quarter most of the season, but show no signs of a sluggish start at Bob Shelton Stadium.\nPaul Brick Kylen Granson scores a touchdown on a reception during Westlake’s win over the Rebels at Bob Shelton Stadium in Buda on Oct. 16,2015. Ehlinger found Cokley for a 26-yard score on the Chaps’ first possession. He then had a 33-yard touchdown pass to Kylen Granson and a 14-yard toss to Reed Klubnick as the Chaps built a 20-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.\nHays’ punter Travis Selby converted his first of two fake punts late in the first quarter as part of a long drive that carried over into the second quarter. The Rebels (4-4, 3-3) capitalized and got the ball down to the Westlake 14-yard-line. Facing fourth and 1, a false start penalty on the Rebels forced Hays to settle for a 36-yard field goal by Jax Kell.\nThat would be the only points the Rebels would get as the Chaps built a 34-3lead at halftime.\nWestlake opened the second half with pretty much the same momentum, but the Chaps had a 59-yard touchdown reception by Cokley called back due to a holding penalty. Eight plays later, however, Ehlinger found Andrew Boykin for one of two touchdown tosses to the junior.\nWestlake had two penalties negate touchdowns. In the first quarter, Elias Garcia had a pick-6 called back for a roughing the passer penalty.\nAfter a 68-yard score by Boykin from Ehlinger on Westlake’s next drive, Mack Kelley returned an interception 30 yards for a touchdown three plays later with 1:51 left in the third quarter.\nWestlake 55, Hays 3\nWestlake (7-0, 5-0) 20 14 21 0 - 55\nHays (4-4, 3-3) 0 3 0 0 - 3\nScoring summary\nFirst quarter\nW – Chase Cokley 26 pass from Sam Ehlinger (Carson Scott kick) – 8:08\nW – Kylen Granson 33 pass from Ehlinger (Scott kick) – 5:24\nW – Reed Klubnik 14 pass from Ehlinger (kick failed) – 4:00\nSecond quarter\nH – Jax Kell 36 field goal – 9:31\nW – Cokley 54 pass from Ehlinger (Scott kick) – 2:47\nW – Ehlinger 3 run (Scott kick) – 0:35\nThird quarter\nW – Andrew Boykin 24 pass from Ehlinger (Scott kick) – 6:56\nW – Boykin 68 pass from Ehlinger (Scott kick) – 3:11\nW – Mack Kelley 30 interception return (Scott kick) – 1:51\nTeam stats H WL\nFirst downs 8 18\nRushes-yards 36-111 27-94\nPassing yards 103 377\nC-A-I 8-25-3 22-27-0\nFumbles-lost 0-0 1-1\nPenalties-yards 3-25 3-35\nPunts-Avg. 5-26.4 2-20.5\nIndividual stats\nRushing: W – Sam Ehlinger 10-55, Izaiah Faz 4-20, Canaan Clark-Bateman 4-7, Kylen Granson 2-7, Noah HOdes 5-5.
