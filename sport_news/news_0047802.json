Manager Terry Collins said Wednesday the back issue was lingering. \nMatz is 4-0 with a 2.27 ERA and 34 strikeouts in six starts. He didn't pitch for the Mets between July 5 and Sept. 6 because a partial muscle tear in his left side. The current injury is on the opposite side of his back. \nThe NL East champion Mets open the playoffs on Oct. 9 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Matz was in line to be their No. 4 starter. \n\"We have to make a determination if he's going to fit or not,\" Collins said. \nCollins said he could use Matz in a relief role this weekend to determine the pitcher's fitness. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:11:07.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
