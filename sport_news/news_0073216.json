Related Stories A Savannah original: Critz Jr. brings home car from 1911 open-wheel race When Dale Critz Jr. drives the pace car Saturday during opening ceremonies for the Savannah Speed Classic, he will be driving a piece of Savannah history that not many people know about — and certainly don’t remember.\nCritz will be behind the wheel of a 1911 E-M-F No. 33 car that competed in the final year of the Great Savannah Races — the American Grand Prix open-wheel automobile races that sped along city streets more than 100 years ago.\nMany don’t know that Savannah was the first city outside Europe to coin its races a Grand Prix, the French title for Grand Prize.\nThe first of those Grand Prix races took place in 1908. It was run by the Savannah Automobile Club, which set up a 17-mile course laid out on city streets south of the historic downtown district framed by Montgomery Crossroad and White Bluff roads, Waters Avenue and what is now Victory Drive.\nAccording to the Great Savannah Races History museum, more than 250,000 showed up to watch the 1908 cars race for 402 miles over 16 laps. A large spectator stand spanned two blocks of Estill Avenue, which is now Victory Drive.\nAlthough a footnote in racing car history, Savannah has revived its claim to racing lore in recent years with the Savannah Speed Classic. Among the sponsors has been the Critz Auto Group, itself part of Savannah’s motoring history since it opened in 1939.\nCritz shelled out $220,000 for the 1911 E-M-F No. 33 that he will be driving. The car finished third in 1912, the final year of the Savannah Grand Prix.\nThe No. 33 race car was discovered in the 1980s in a New York barn by auto collector Gordon Matson of New Hampshire. He brought it “home” to Savannah in 2008 for the Hilton Head/Savannah Historics.\nDale Critz Jr. is a car guy, too. His grandfather opened the first Critz dealership in January 1939, and his father followed in the family business. He didn’t consider himself a serious car collector, although he owns an eclectic mix with a 1949 GMC pickup truck, a 2002 BMW Z8 roadster and a 1958 Isetta microcar (or “bubble car”).\n“I’ve got a few old cars, nothing else like this,” Critz said.\nCollecting got more serious as he pursued the No. 33 race car with Savannah in its origin story. Critz said he doesn’t know of other cars still existing from Savannah’s turn-of-the-century races except for one in an Indianapolis museum and another he heard about in Sweden.\nInterestingly, the E-M-F cars (which stands for company founders Barney Everitt, William Metzger and Walter Flanders) never really caught on. That may be because serious motorheads derogatorily referred to the E-M-F vehicles as “Every Morning Fix-it” and “Every Mechanical Fault.” But that contributes to the car’s rarity and its historic value and the significance of snagging one for the home crowd.\n“If there was going to be a car in Savannah that raced in Savannah, this was our best chance,” he said last week. “So that’s why I bought it.”\nCritz’s sense of community is not new. Critz Auto Group has long-sponsored events in Chatham County, including the annual Tybee Run Fest.\nSaturday, however, will be a chance for Critz to take the stage at an event his company has sponsored for years.\nHe will don goggles, a helmet, driving gloves and will have a passenger in the left-side seat where a mechanic sat out of necessity during those early 20th century races. His passenger will be the race commander, Mayor Edna Jackson, who’s also nearing the finish line in a much different kind of race.\nCritz paid a lot of money for this antique racing car, but it’s Savannah that owes him a debt of gratitude for driving home a part of the city’s little-known history.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14809935", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14809935", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:11:12.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
