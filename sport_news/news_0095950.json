There's no time off. He doesn't sit there for 10 minutes and play around on his phone. He goes in, he gets to work.\" \nGabriel will get to show off his game to UK fans sooner than originally expected. \nWilbraham & Monson has been scheduled to play in the Thoroughbred Classic — a new showcase that will be played at Paul Laurence Dunbar on Dec. 12-13. \nThe event was organized by the same people behind the Marshall County Hoop Fest, and the four-game lineup features top national prospects such as Thon Maker, Rawle Alkins, DeAndre Ayton, Jarred Vanderbilt and Marvin Bagley — all players that UK has recruited at one time or another. \nWilbraham & Monson is set to play against Maker's team at 8 p.m., on Dec. 12 (ticket information will be announced soon), and Mannix said Gabriel can't wait for the opportunity. \n\"When we talked about it a week or so ago, his face just lit up,\" he said. \nGabriel is currently UK's top-rated commitment for next year's class. \nJohn Calipari recruited him to Lexington to play on the perimeter, and much of his work this fall has been centered on preparing for that role. \nMannix said that — in addition to putting more weight on his 195-pound frame — Gabriel has focused on developing a more consistent jump shot and tightening up his ball handling while maintaining already-solid post skills that should help him exploit mismatches at the next level. \nRanked by Scout.com as the No. 10 player in the loaded class of 2016, Gabriel has as much upside as anyone in the country. And he fully understands what he's getting into. \n\"He didn't choose Kentucky — and to play for Coach Cal — just because of the success on the court and the chance to maximize his own potential,\" Mannix said. \"He knows that Kentucky and Big Blue Nation are really special things. And he understands the history. He understands how important Kentucky basketball is in the whole state of Kentucky, and not just the city of Lexington.\" \n\"He's really looking forward to being a part of something as special as Kentucky basketball.\" Ben Roberts: (859) 231-3216.
