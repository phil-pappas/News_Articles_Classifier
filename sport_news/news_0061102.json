He didn’t provide any update on McNichols’ status for Friday’s key Mountain Division game at Utah State. \nMcNichols was wearing sweats when the game ended at Colorado State. \n“Not coming (back) in, that’s a problem,” Harsin said Saturday night. \nMcNichols leads the nation with 14 touchdowns in six games. He has scored at least two touchdowns in every game. \nHe has more than twice as many carries (100) and rushing yards (485) as any other player on the team. He also ranks third on the team with 20 receptions and fourth with 196 receiving yards. \nThe Broncos (5-1 overall, 2-0 Mountain West) face one of their biggest tests of the season at Utah State (3-2, 2-0), the preseason pick to challenge them for the division title. \nThe Broncos returned to Boise after midnight Sunday morning. They’ll leave Thursday by bus for Logan. In between, several players will need to have ailments tended to. Cornerback Donte Deayon and left tackle Rees Odhiambo also left the Colorado State game but both returned. \n“I’m concerned about quite a few guys,” Harsin said. \nOther notes: \n— The Broncos’ players of the game: wide receiver Thomas Sperbeck and McNichols (offense), cornerback Jonathan Moxey (defense), Deayon (special teams), right guard Steven Baggett (O-line) and tackle Justin Taimatuia (D-line). \n— The Broncos will practice Monday-Wednesday this week, pushing the entire schedule up a day. \n— Nickel Chanceller James was entertaining Sunday during his turn at the press conference. “We don’t let offenses get into a rhythm,” he said. “If we let offenses get into a rhythm, it’s like a song — it just keeps going. It’s terrible.” \n(I’ll post my full rundown of the press conference on Monday morning. The videos are still uploading.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:16:18.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
