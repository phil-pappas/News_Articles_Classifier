Florida receiver Antonio Callaway, who had a 72-yard punt return for a score, also had his hands on a long pass to the end zone from Treon Harris in the middle of the fourth quarter, but LSU's Dwyane Thomas punched it out to prevent a tying touchdown.\nHarris, starting for the suspended Will Grier, passed for 271 yards and two touchdowns for Florida (6-1, 4-1 SEC), with both scoring passes to tight end Jake McGee.\nBrandon Harris threw for 202 yards and two scores for LSU, which will host Western Kentucky next week.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:24:16.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
