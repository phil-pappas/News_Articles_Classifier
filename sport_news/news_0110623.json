The Rangers placed fourth-line winger Tanner Glass on waivers Tuesday at noon to relieve salary cap pressure, seemingly confident in their existing depth.\nGlass, 31, is in the second season of a three-year contract with a $1.45 million annual cap hit. Another NHL team can claim him prior to noon Wednesday and take on his full charge. If Glass clears waivers, the Rangers will assign him to their AHL franchise, the Hartford Wolf Pack, and only a fraction ($500,000) of his total salary will remain on their NHL team cap charge, which the league calculates daily.\nThe Rangers have been operating with only about $150,000 of space under the NHL’s $71.4 million salary cap ceiling, carrying 14 forwards. If Glass clears waivers, the Blueshirts will have about $1.5 million of operating space.\nGlass had one goal, six points and 98 penalty minutes in 66 regular season games last season, and one assist in 19 games in the postseason, when he played his most effective hockey. He has a good relationship with coach Alain Vigneault from their days together in Vancouver and was also brought in due his professionalism off-ice.\nBut he played in just two of the Rangers’ first seven games this season, and encouraging recent performances on the fourth line from Viktor Stalberg (Monday at the Garden) and Emerson Etem (Thursday in Montreal) clearly made the decision for Vigneault and GM Jeff Gorton.\nEtem, 23, had a woeful preseason, keeping Glass around, but the front office doesn’t want to lose the lone NHL player they acquired in Carl Hagelin’s trade to Anaheim this summer. And given a second chance in his season debut in Montreal, Etem showed promise on the forecheck.\nThe presence of offseason signing Jarret Stoll, a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Los Angeles Kings, alongside Dominic Moore also contributed to pushing Glass out of the picture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:50:15.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
