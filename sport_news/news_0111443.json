That’s why we lost. In all aspects, I wasn’t able to prepare against Letran,” said Jarin in the post-match press conference.\nWith Ayo’s so-called “House of Chaos” in full effect once more, the five-time champions turned the ball over 29 times allowing Letran to score 25 points off those miscues.\n“We had too many turnovers. We had our chances and we weren’t able to execute and I take the blame for that. I failed to coach the right way,” he added.\nWhile they were busy turning the ball over, the Knights’ veteran quartet immediately went to work as Kevin Racal exploded for a season best 28 points.\nRey Nambatac added 18, Mark Cruz finished with 17 while McJour Luib added 16 to add to the Lions’ woes.\nAll four of these players were part of the Knights squad which lost in three games against San Beda in 2013. Cruz and Racal were even part of the 2012 Letran team which succumbed to the Red Lions in humiliating fashion, losing 67-39 in Game Three of the finals.\nBut all’s not lost for Jarin as he believes that they can still turn things around assuming they match the Knights effort and make the right decisions.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:30:54.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
