Craig Cathcart had put the visitors ahead in the 31st. \nGreece finally ended its miserable run when substitute Panagiotis Kone headed in the winner in the 86th minute. \nHungary led twice in the second half, only for Greece to equalize twice within three minutes. \nHungary finished third in the group and will have another chance to reach the finals through a playoff game. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:50:31.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
