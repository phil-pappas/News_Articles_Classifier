This is a new look team from the one that began last season 5-23 and revamped its roster on the fly.\nMarcus Morris, Stanley Johnson and Steve Blake are among the new faces. Center Andre Drummond has a new game that he continues to perfect and Reggie Jackson begins his new role as the lead guy. The Pistons are viewed as a wild card by many NBN observers. They can surprise just as easily as they can crash and burn.\nThe problem with this team isn’t talent. It is familiarity. The result is likely to be some nights where they look like the Golden State\nWarriors but too many nights where they look like the woeful Sacramento Kings.\n“We are hungry man,” Morris said. “We are just trying to get better. We are building, trying to get good habits. Our ultimate goal is to make the playoffs. We can’t look that far so you keep trying to get better.”\nThe solution is both simple yet complicated. If the Pistons play good defense, which is a chore for this team, and move the ball then they should be fine. There are nights where the ball movement causes coach Stan Van Gundy to dance for joy and there are nights where he stomps his foot in anger. He often does not know which Piston team will show up.\nHe wants to see ball movement and it is a reason fans might see more of journeyman Steve Blake than expected. During the Pistons 115-87 victory over the Hawks he was a passing whiz. Blake finished with 12 assists in just 23 minutes. And once he started passing teammates got into the moment and began to pass also.\n“We’ve had moments in every game,” Van Gundy said. “Tonight was really good. It really stood out with Steve. We had back cuts and guys will start to cut and move without the ball better if they know they are going to get the ball. I thought it was a great model for our team.”\nIt would not be surprising for Van Gundy to pull Jackson for Blake if he does not like what he sees. Blake is a savvy veteran that has bounces around the league. He is not a big scorer and knows it. So he plays within the team and tries to make others better.\n“For us to be successful that is the way it has to be,” Blake said. “We have a few players that can go one on one, but overall the ball has to be moving and we have to shoot the ball well.”\nToil pays off \nHard work and hunger earned Reggie Bullock a roster spot on the Pistons. The Pistons are expected to release injured forward Danny Granger, paving the way for Bullock to make the roster. Van Gundy said he’s been the Pistons best player during training camp.\nIf he sticks then he is likely to make more money. He will make $1.25 million this season and if the Pistons keep him for next season, he will get a $1 million raise. Now you see where the hunger comes in.\n\"It means more to me just being on an NBA roster,\" Bullock said. \"Getting paid is another thing, but just being on a roster when I know that I belong in this league is the only thing I'm worried about.”\nBullock earned a spot on this team, something Van Gundy was reluctant to say. But he all but assured that Bullock has a spot this weekend.\n“When you look at the whole thing and consistency game in and game out he was our best player in the preseason,” Van Gundy said. “Certainly our most consistent guy. It would be really hard to find any fault with what he did in the preseason. He’s certainly gained our confidence.”\nBullock said his main job is to be ready and work hard on the defensive end when called on.\n“My mindset when I come into games is straight defense,” Bullock said. “When I get open shots I try to knock them down. My mindset is to defend team’s best players, make things tough for them and lock people down. If you do that there is always a place for you to play basketball.”\nBlake's role \n\nBlake said he is completely healthy after sitting out most of the preseason with a concussion. He took a nasty spill during a practice and did not play until Friday when produced with 12 assists and five rebounds.\nHe will likely back up Jackson.\n“I have never been through this before, so I didn’t know what to expect,” Blake said. “It took longer than I expected. I tried to come back and ride the bike but had a setback, had migraines. I was not expecting that but that is the way it goes. You go through it and it is time to move on.”\ntfoster@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/terryfoster971", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:08:35.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
