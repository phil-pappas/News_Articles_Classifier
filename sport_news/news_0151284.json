Former NFL player and North Dakota native Phil Hansen will visit the youth program in Milbank Saturday and share a safety message. \nYouth football, which gives elementary kids the opportunity to play the sport, has been in Milbank for a decade. The last three years it's been involved in a safety program through USA Football called Heads Up Football. \n\"It's not for show. This is the real deal. We're doing it because we want these kids to be safe,\" coach Dan Snaza said. \nCoaches want kids to demonstrate safe practices. Among other things, those practices are designed more than before to protect players’ heads. Snaza attends training every year and passes the lessons he learns on to others. \nOther programs in the state and country use the same safety program. Coach and father Brian Sandvig is thankful for the shift he's seen in football training. \n\"I played when I was a kid. I want my kids to play. I'd love for my grandkids to play, but they're still your children, and it's all about knowing that you're putting them into a safe environment,\" Sandvig said. \nOf course coaches want to see kids remain safe when they're involved in youth football, but that's just the beginning. Those kids move on to junior high football and eventually board the bus for varsity games. \nCoaches want the safest known practices on the field to become habits by the time they reach those levels. Coaches hope to see the following results from there. \n\"They've been safe. They've been relatively injury free and have had a good experience, win or lose I think we've done our job. And that's our goal, to keep them safe and hopefully they have fun with the program, with football,\" Snaza said. \nThe program is designed to educate both kids and parents. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
