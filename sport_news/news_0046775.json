Whether you are at a kids' soccer game or running to the grocery store there's a good chance you'll see petitioners who are looking to get issues on the November 2016 ballot. \nIf it seems like there are more of them than usual, there's a reason for that. \nIt's easy to find petitioners, unless you're driving a news car. \nA KELOLAND News Crew stopped by the downtown Post Office this afternoon and when they noticed us, they stopped what they were doing got in their car and drove away. \nIt was a similar scene outside the county administration building when circulators left their posts when our crew showed up. \n\"I think from all the stuff in the news and just hearing about everyone coming from out-of-state some people don't even want to approach us and that's just disheartening because they don't even know what I have. They don't know I'm actually from South Dakota. I'm a resident I'm trying to help people of South Dakota,\" Olson said. \nBut not every petitioner is camera shy. Sarah Olson is a South Dakota resident who wants to put the issue of capping Pay Day Loan interest rates on the ballot in 2016, and she's not alone. \nAccording to the Secretary of State's Office , as many as 15 measures could make it on the ballot. That would be the largest number ever. The deadline for the signatures is November 9th. \nLori Stacey is collecting signatures to get the Constitution Party ballot access in 2016. She says she needs to collect nearly 7,000 valid signatures before March, but she wants to be done before then. \n\"It doesn't make sense for parties to wait too long or otherwise you're not going to run candidates for 2016, but this petition allows the party four-years of ballot access in South Dakota,\" Stacey said. \nOlson says no matter the issue you're trying to get on the ballot, she thinks collecting signatures is a good way to do it. \n\"I think it's a really good process we have here in South Dakota. It's a lot of these issues that that the people really care about. It's just a matter of getting people to stop and talk with us and be willing to help us with these issues,\" Olson said. \nOlson and Stacey say even with so many petitioners out collecting signatures, most of them have good intentions. \nHere is the history on the number of ballot measures on ballots in South Dakota in past years according to the Secratary of State's Office: \n1910 â€“ 11 ballot measures", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:52:15.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
