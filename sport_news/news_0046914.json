No. That’s the piece that goes along with it. The guys we have right now are what we have for the next seven ballgames. We have to make sure they play it better.” \nLike other losses this season, the offense, defense, and special teams all struggled at times. Changes won’t be coming to the defensive scheme or to the offensive’s starting playcaller in Sam Richardson. But, Rhoads said that a kicking competition is most likely open. \nHere’s how the Cyclones did in key areas of the game. \nPass offense: Richardson struggles, still the starter \nEven Rhoads couldn’t hide the struggles of Richardson, who completed just 10 of 21 passes for 131 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions — the first coming on Iowa State’s first offensive play of the game. Richardson’s struggles left many calling for more of backup quarterback Joel Lanning. \nLanning, who has taken some snaps mostly in running situations, was inserted for good in the fourth quarter. But, that won’t become a permanent move. \n“Sam was not having one of his better days and we got Joel snaps,” Rhoads said. “He hasn’t really had a chance to go out there, play quarterback and run the offense. We wanted to get him some snaps.\" Peterson: Save for Warren, nothing works for Cyclones \nLanning completed 5 of 9 passes for 41 yards. He also ran for 22 yards on six carries, including a 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. \n“I thought he performed well,” Rhoads said. “Thought he threw accurate balls, very catchable balls. Probably should have had a couple more completions when it was all said and done. Showed poise in the pocket.” \nWide receiver Quenton Bundrage finished with three catches for 75 yards and one touchdown which came on a big third-and-3. He also helped Iowa State convert on fourth-and-4 on the Texas Tech 37-yard line with a 36-yard catch. One play later, Joshua Thomas ran it in for a 1-yard touchdown. \nIowa State finished with 495 yards of total offense, with 315 of that coming on the ground. \n“I think we just struggled offensively, today,” said Iowa State wide receiver Allen Lazard. “We couldn’t get anything really going so I think it actually put more stress on the defense.” \nLazard had a highlight-reel play where he broke free of the Texas Tech defense trying to tackle him and nearly bulldozed his way into the end zone. Inconsistency put too much stress on the Cyclones defense \nRush offense: Warren follows up historic performance with another historic performance \nRunning back Mike Warren, who broke into the record books during Iowa State’s last game, added his name again against Texas Tech. Warren rushed for 245 yards, the eight-best single-game mark in school history. The 245 was also the most by a freshman in the FBS this season. \nWarren also broke his own school freshman record for single-game rushing yards. Even more impressive: Just five games into the season, Warren has already broken Iowa State’s single-season freshman rushing record of 471 set by Stevie Hicks in 2003. \nWarren embraced the idea that expectations could be getting higher for him by fans. \n“If they set the bar high, then it’s up to me to reach that,” Warren said. “And I feel like this game truly showed that we, as an offense, we can run the ball.” \nIowa State finished with a season-high 315 rushing yards. It’s the first time with three consecutive games with over 200 yards on the ground since they did it five straight times in 2009. Joshua Thomas added two 1-yard rushing touchdowns. ISU takeaways: Cyclones set records, both good and bad \nPass defense: Secondary struggles to stop Mahomes \nTexas Tech quarterback Pat Mahomes had his way with the Iowa State defense, passing for 428 yards and five touchdowns. His big day helped pave the way for a school-record 776 yards of total offense. The biggest blow came after Iowa State pulled to within 10-7 in the first quarter and Mahomes responded with a 1-play touchdown drive — a 75-yard pass to Jakeem Grant who ran to the end zone. \n“We have to play better perimeter run and pass defense,” Rhoads said. “That’s our outside linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties. Those are the guys on alert when those plays occur.” \nSecond-ranked Texas Christian and third-ranked Baylor will showcase just as dangerous, if not even more lethal offenses in the coming weeks. \n“The speed and pace isn’t going to slow down the next two weeks,” Rhoads said. “On paper, the next two offenses are better than this one.” \nIowa State did record one sack, it's 15th of the season, matching the total from 2014. \nRush defense: Texas Tech run game shines \nTexas Tech’s rushing attack caused just as many problems as its passing game. The Red Raiders finished with 261 yards on the ground, including a team-high 101 yards from Justin Stockton. \n“We have to leverage them faster,” Rhoads said of his defense. “We have to get off blocks better and we have to tackle with urgency and immediately. There’s angles involved with that.” \nRhoads said defending the perimeter was an issue. \n“My biggest concern is that we should be able to play the perimeter run and we should be able to play the perimeter pass with equal speed and equal success,” Rhoads said. “We did not do that very well. We have to get that cleaned up.” Iowa State can't keep up with Texas Tech in loss \nSpecial teams: Netten and Francis to battle for job \nKicker Cole Netten missed another field goal, which was enough to convince Rhoads to open a kicking competition. Netten, who missed a 40-yard attempt, later made an attempt from 20 yards. But, the kicker has struggled with his consistency and redshirt freshman Chris Francis was the one to boot the extra point on a fourth-quarter touchdown. \n“It was an awful kick, by the way,” Rhoads said. \nFrancis may get another shot. \n“We’ll probably kick all week to see who’s that guy,” Rhoads said.
