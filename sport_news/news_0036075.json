(Getty Images) By Karim Zidan \nOver the last few decades, boxing has been dominated by belligerence, arrogance, denigrations and wealth. From Muhammad Ali to Mike Tyson to Floyd Mayweather, boxing has been as much about brand as it is about talent. Few fighters can resonate with the American audience without the strategic use of catchphrases or flashy personas. \nDespite the half-century trajectory of dramatic flare and bombastic personas, HBO is set to test the waters with its latest potential star -- a fighter who has yet to master the English language and who hails from Kazakhstan. His name is Gennady Gennadyevich Golovkin -- you can call him GGG -- and he is about to become boxing's next big thing. \nGolovkin is a middleweight fighter (160 pounds) with an undefeated 33-0 record. He was a decorated amateur fighter, a scholarship holder with the Olympic Solidarity program in 2002, and even won a silver medal at the 2004 Olympic games in Athens before moving to the pro ranks with a 345-5 amateur record. Since then, he has accumulated the majority of the sport's middleweight titles, including the World Boxing Organization (WBO), the World Boxing Association (WBA) Regular, the International Boxing Federation and the International Boxing Organization (IBO) middleweight titles. His sheer dominance in this weight class makes him undoubtedly the best middleweight fighter on the planet. \nHowever, while Golovkin's championship accomplishments are plenty, it was the way he earned each of those victories that separated him from the pack. Of Golovkin's 33 professional wins, 30 were T/KOs. He's currently on a streak of 20 consecutive knockout wins, and his powerful punches and vicious finishes have earned him the label of one of the most exciting fighters in boxing. \nThat sentiment only grew stronger as Golovkin neared his U.S. debut in 2012. His ferocious style resonated with the casual audience, and his sense of urgency and love for violent finishes struck a chord with the hardcore fans who had clamored for changes in boxing's mainstream appeal. Golovkin arrived in the United States with a legion of Russian and Kazakhstan boxing fans and dazzled audiences at the sold-out StubHub Center and Madison Square Garden to expand his fan base to the prosperous North American market. \nThe violent Kazakh with a boyish smile and charming personality was about to become a star. \nPerfectly aware of the potential gold mine on their hands, HBO placed Golovkin in an anticipated showdown with French Canadian David Lemieux, a fellow knockout artist and fan favorite, for a fight on Saturday. They pulled out all the stops --- countdown shows and media tours filled the two fighters' schedules to promote the Golovkin's first appearance on pay-per-view. It is the long-awaited test to determine whether GGG is ready to embrace the spotlight. \nAll signs point to a lucrative evening. \nThe ex-Soviet Union block has developed a slew of top-ranked boxers, all of whom have been unleashed on the unassuming West. Boxers such as heavyweight champ Wladimir Klitschko (Ukraine), Sergey Kovalev (Russia), Ruslan Provodnikov (Russia) and Vasyl Lomachenko (Ukraine) have either won championships or are in positions to do so in the near future. What separates them from Golovkin, though, is the general absence of a Western fan base outside of hardcore boxing connoisseurs. Eastern European and Eurasian fighters do not historically earn the support of American fans, especially given boxing's longstanding tradition of capitalizing on patriotism and racial tensions to drum up attention for a fight. \nThat no longer appears to be the case, at least in this particular event. HBO has taken the risk of placing a Kazakhstan native in his first PPV main event against a French Canadian in front of a sellout American crowd at Madison Square Garden. \nNow that the trend of American fans supporting American fighters appears to have wavered, few doubt Golovkin's name recognition. GGG's main event against Matthew Macklin in 2013 drew 1.1 million viewers, while his most recent fight against Willie Monroe Jr. in May peaked at 1.474 million. \n\"People understand that I bring a new story,\" Golovkin told Bad Left Hook. \"I always thought it would be possible to [sell out Madison Square Garden], and it is very interesting because -- and I will not apologize for this -- the stars are not American. They are international stars from Nicaragua [Roman Gonzalez in the co-main event] and Kazakhstan. Great champions are coming.\" \nGolovkin's first PPV may not necessarily be the exaggerated success that many hope it will be. The fight Saturday comes just a few short weeks after Mayweather's supposed retirement fight against Andre Berto. A modest PPV buy rate would be considered a win for HBO. Nevertheless, Golovkin's ascension as a PPV boxer emphasizes the evolution of boxing stardom and the gradual globalization of the sport as a whole. \n\"This is my first PPV fight and I want it to be the first day of my new story,\" Golovkin said. \nWe'll be watching. \n* * * Karim Zidan was born and raised in Cairo, Egypt.
