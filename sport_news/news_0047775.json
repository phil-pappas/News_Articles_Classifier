(and she) did drive through a plate glass window, so that was a fail on the test,\" Tyler added.\nThe damage to the building is mainly cosmetic. The window will have to be replaced, but there is no structural damage. There also is some damage to the car.\nTyler said he believes the student will get another change to take the driving test.\n\"Hopefully she can get more instruction and a chance to retest,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:52:28.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
