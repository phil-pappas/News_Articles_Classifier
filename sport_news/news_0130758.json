However, the CBA allows up to two weeks for hearing to be held, and MLB honchos agreed they didn't want to rush things.\nUtley released the following statement on Monday:\n\"The Players Association and my agent are handling the appeals process. I have nothing more to say other than to reiterate that I feel terrible about Ruben's injury. Now my teammates and I are focused on Game 3 and doing everything we can to win this series.\" Utley, who was given a two-game suspension by MLB for what was deemed a slide outside the rules of the game, should receive quite a negative reception from Mets fans for Game 3 Monday night and Game 4 Tuesday. The Mets also weren't too pleased with Utley's side, so emotions will be riding high.\nPeople connected to the union suggest there is confidence on that side that the case is winnable based on a lack of precedent to punch aggressive baserunners. Even so, it isn;t unreasonable that they want time to compile the facts and prepare the case.\nUtley's agent Joel Wolfe called he two-game ban given to Utley by MLB \"outrageous\" and \"completely unacceptable.\" They intend to vigorously defend their client, and 24 or even 48 hours isn't seen as sufficent preparation time.\nUtley received the two-game ban from MLB on-field operations head Joe Torre for his slide in Game 2 which Utley said was intended to take out Tejada for the double play. Tejada wound up breaking his leg on the play (it was learned he won't need surgery, but only six-to-eight weeks in a cast). Chase Utley's appeal will likely keep him around in the series.
