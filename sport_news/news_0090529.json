(Photo: Juan Villa and Joanna Coune) 56 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWho’s the best running back in the Central Section? \nIs it Romello Harris? \nThe Tulare Union senior star running back is on his way to becoming the Central Section’s all-time leading rusher, and is the frontrunner to being named the Times-Delta/Advance-Register Bob Mathias Award winner for a second straight season. \nOr is it Isaiah Jones? \nThe one player in the section that has matched Harris’ exploits over the last two weeks is the Porterville senior star running back, who was named the Cal-Hi Sports Northern California offensive player of the week on Tuesday. \nNo better way to settle the argument than having the two players square off against one another on the same field. \nWhich is going to happen Friday night with the Tulare Union Redskins (7-0, 2-0) taking on the Porterville Panthers (2-5, 1-1) at Jacob Rankin Stadium on the Granite Hills campus. Friday’s game time is listed at 7 p.m. \nHarris’ accomplishments have been well-chronicled, and are worth mentioning again. Harris ranks second in the state with 1,839 yards rushing, and he’s averaging over 300 yards rushing per game. He is 823 yards away from becoming the Central Section’s career rushing leader. \nCollege coaches and recruiting beatniks are enamored with Harris as well. The Big Picture: High School Football \nHe ranks as the state’s No. 69 overall player according to the composite rankings of 247sports.com , and the nation’s No. 42 running back. The consensus three-star recruit has an impressive list of scholarship offers that include Washington, Duke and Washington State. \nJones, who earned 2014 all-state honors from Cal-Hi Sports last season (2,103 yards rushing, 25 touchdowns), was named the Cal-Hi Sports Northern California offensive player of the week after rushing for a school-record 426 yards and five touchdowns in Porterville’s 45-42 loss to Tulare Western on Friday. Of Jones’ five touchdowns, four of them were for 52 yards or more. \nIn two East Yosemite League games, Jones has rushed for 728 yards and 11 touchdowns — those numbers would be outstanding over the course of the season for the vast majority of running backs in the area. \nAnd when it comes to Tulare Union-Porterville games, fasten your seat belts: \n•In 2012, the Redskins and Panthers set a CIF state record for most combined points in a game (165) with Porterville winning, 86-79 (no overtime). \n•In 2014, Tulare Union toppled Porterville 55-34. Harris and Jones combined for 747 yards (402 for Harris, 345 for Jones) and nine touchdown (five for Harris, four for Jones). \nCould be a very special night Friday in Porterville. Western’s Wild Win: Mustangs edge Porterville \nHere’s a look at some of the other top story lines in Tulare County high school football this week: \nSid Hosking Trophy Watch: Redwood (1-6, 1-2) can take a major step forward in its quest to recpature the Sid Hosking Trophy (the Visalia city championship between the city’s four West Yosemite League schools) if it can knock off El Diamante (3-4, 1-2) Friday night at Giant Chevrolet Cadillac Mineral King Bowl (game time is 7:30 p.m.). Redwood knocked off defending Sid Hosking Trophy winner Golden West (17-8 score) for its lone win. Ranger defense has been the primary strength in their last two games (limiting Golden West to eight points, and forcing six turnovers in a 28-26 loss to Hanford). Michael Bean was the featured back for the Rangers against Hanford (Justin Williams was sidelined with an injury). Miners need two more wins to qualify for the Central Section Division II playoffs. They snapped a three-game skid with a 35-13 win over Hanford West. Top two offensive threats for the Miners are running backs Keylan Liles (438 yards, 6 TDs) and Kymonte Williams (7.1 yards-per-carry average, 3 TDs). In the win over Hanford West, Liles and Williams combined for 240 yards rushing and three touchdowns. Calpreps.com is predicting a 21-20 El Diamante win. \nMustang Magic or Hawk Resilience? Friday’s all-Tulare affair between Tulare Western (4-3, 2-0) and three-time defending EYL champion Mission Oak (3-4, 1-1) is a crucial game for both teams in many ways. For the Mustangs, a second straight win over Mission Oak would set them up for a Bell Game showdown against Tulare Union on Nov. 6, a game that should have EYL title implications for both teams. For the Hawks, they obviously need a win Friday night to keep its dream alive of a fourth straight league title. And Mission Oak needs to win two out of its final three games to advance to the Central Section Division III playoffs, and it hosts Tulare Union next week. Playing a key role in Tulare Western’s surge to begin EYL play is junior quarterback Andre Aguilar, a transfer from Mission Oak. Mustangs have scored 83 points over Aguilar’s two starts. Aguilar, a dual-threat QB, has accounted for five touchdowns in two games. Mission Oak has played very well offensively to begin EYL action (70 points over two games). Hawk senior QB Trey McJunkin has thrown for 503 yards and seven TDs in the two league games. Michael Villa is among Central Section receiving leaders with 30 catches for 539 yards. Calpreps.com is projecting a 28-27 Tulare Western win. \nEYL Time Warning: The official kickoff time for EYL games is at 7 p.m., a practice that started last season. But in 2014, most of the league games began at 7:30 p.m. or later. That trend has changed this season. The last two Tulare Western games have started around 7:15 p.m., as did Mission Oak’s game against Monache. Officially, the varsity game begins 30 minutes after the completion of the junior varsity game. \nBack on Track for the Trailblazers? Golden West (2-5, 0-3) has endured some rough sledding to begin WYL action. Golden West nearly pulled a major upset last week against Hanford (8-0, 4-0), as the Trailblazers erased an early Bullpup lead to forge a 21-21 tie late in the third quarter. But the Bullpups prevailed with a 28-21 win, and now Golden West must win its final three games to qualify for postseason play. The Trailblazers will host Hanford West (1-7, 0-4) on Friday (game time is 7:30 p.m.). Last year, Golden West defeated Hanford West 56-21. Calpreps.com is projecting a 35-14 Golden West win. The Big Picture: High School Football \nPioneers on the rebound: If Mt. Whitney (4-3, 2-1) is going to have a shot at winning a share of the WYL championship it needs to win Friday night against Hanford (8-0, 4-0) at Hanford’s Neighbor Bowl (game time is 7:30 p.m.). Key for Mt. Whitney is controlling the game with an effective run game. Pioneers are averaging 141 yards rushing per game. If they can top the 200-yard mark, they’ve got a reasonable chance to pull off the upset. Isaac Campos is the leading rusher with 639 yards rushing (5.5 yards-per-carry average) to go with seven rushing touchdowns. Junior QB Isaiah Salazar has a 53.8 completion rate to go with 943 yards passing, seven TDs, 10 INTs. Hanford has one of the better QB-RB combos in the Tulare-Kings Counties area with junior QB Ryan Johnson (averaging 187 yards passing per game, 63.2 completion rate) and senior running back Joseph McDaniel (1,1,63 yards rushing, 15 TDs, 7.6 yards-per-carry average). Despite their recent struggles against Redwood and Golden West, the Bullpups are favored to win this game by Calpreps.com — Hanford 44, Mt. Whitney 19. \nCavalier Charge: CVC (5-2, 1-1) wraps up Central Sequoia League play with back-to-back pivotal homes against Kingsburg (Friday) and Selma (Oct. 30). Kingsburg and Selma are both 1-0 in league. If the Cavaliers win both games, they’ll win at least a share of the CSL crown. Fueling CVC’s offense is a ground attack that is averaging 239 yards rushing per game. Senior Kolin Stock is among section leaders with 1,172 yards rushing and 15 TDs. Cavalier defense is averaging 6.5 tackles for loss per game, led by senior Bradley Taylor, who has recorded 11 tackles for loss. Kingsburg has one of the more balanced offenses in the Central Section with junior quarterback Anthony Sierra (58.1 completion rate, averaging 205.6 yards passing per game, 10 TDs, 2 INTs) and senior running back Seth Brooks (735 yards rushing, 7.1 yards-per-carry average). \nEmperors fighting to keep the CSL crown: While CVC takes on Kingsburg, defending CSL champion Dinuba (4-4, 1-1) is looking to get back on track by stopping this year’s juggernaut known as the Selma Bears (6-1) on the road. Dinuba dropped a 40-35 decision to Kingsburg last week. Top offensive stalwarts for Dinuba are senior running back Elijah Benham (645 yards, 4.7 yards-per-carry, 10 TDs), senior receiver Jacob Paradine (25 receptions, 428 yards, 7 TDs) and senior quarterback Isaac Leppke (58.7 completion rate, 871 yards passing, 9 TDs, 5 INTs). Selma has dominated on both sides of the ball. The Bears are averaging a Central Section-leading 43.9 points per game. They haven’t allowed more than 16 points at any point during their current six-game winning streak. \nESL Showdown: Leo Robinson Field in Woodlake on Friday night will be the site for the East Sequoia League game of the year with Woodlake (5-2, 2-0) hosting Lindsay (3-4, 2-0). Game time is 7:15 p.m. The offensive standout for Woodlake in beginning the league campaign 2-0 is freshman quarterback Robby Stevenson, the grandson of the late Leo Robinson, Woodlake’s legendary coach. Tigers have scored 75 points over their first two league games. Lindsay earned its 2-0 league record by winning a couple of nail-biters — a 21-20 victory over Sierra Pacific and a 20-17 decision over Granite Hills. \nBye Week: Exeter (5-3). 56 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1LNBoU6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:33:21.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
