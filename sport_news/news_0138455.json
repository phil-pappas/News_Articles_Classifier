It's believed the two men lunched together that fateful day in 1912.\nSalomon also took away a printed ticket from the Titanic's opulent Turkish baths, which recorded a person's weight when seated in a specially designed upholstered lounge chair. The ticket bears the names of three of the five other first-class passengers with him on Lifeboat 1. One of four weighing chair tickets known to exist, it sold for $11,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:05:49.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
