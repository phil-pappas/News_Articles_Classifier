He also led the team in 3-pointers (102), assists (89) and steals (44) during the 2014-15 season. \nWith an interesting mix of returning players, five freshmen and a transfer from Georgia, McDevitt has a lot of choices and decisions to make about playing time as the Bulldogs try to improve on last year's 15-16 mark, their first losing record in five seasons. \nAsheville was 10-8 in the Big South Conference, the eighth straight year of double-digit league wins, the longest current streak in the BSC. \nRowsey's departure is not the only loss — five others from the top 11 in minutes played last year, five players who started seven games or more or averaged 10 or more minutes are gone, leaving a lot of playing time available. \n\"One of the fun things in coaching is to watch players develop, from the time they get here to the time they leave,\" said McDevitt, who is a 32-31 in his two seasons as coach. \n\"And part of that development is to see how they react when their roles change. All of our players - the guys coming back who are going to have to step up and play bigger roles, and the new guys looking for playing time - are going to go through these changes this year.\" \nThe Bulldogs' core is expected to be four players who started more than half the games last season - junior guard David Robertson (10.7 ppg), junior center Giacomo Zilli (5.4 ppg), senior forward Sam Hughes (6.1 ppg) and sophomore swing player Kevin Vannatta (7.6 ppg). \nJunior forward Will Weeks and sophomore swing player Ahmad Thomas also return after logging more than 15 minutes per game last season as reserves, and McDevitt likes what he has seen so far from both. \n\"Will has lost about 25 pounds, and he looks like a different player,\" said McDevitt of the former Christ School standout who started as a freshman but lost more than a year of playing time after knee surgery. \n\"And Ahmad has really looked good in practice, good enough to where he could be in the starting lineup or the first player off the bench.\" \nPost help could come from John Cannon, a 6-10 fifth-year senior from Mountain Heritage High who transferred from Georgia. \nGuard David Robertson (13), is Asheville's top returning scorer at 10.7 points per game. (Photo: William Woody / wwoody@citizen-t, William Woody / wwoody@citizen-t) \nMcDevitt believes as many as three of his five freshmen can make an immediate impact — guards Trae Bryant, Dwayne Sutton and Dylan Smith. \nSmith (6-5, from Mobile, Alabama) and Bryant (6-1 from Wilmington) are candidates to play point guard, while Sutton is an athletic 6-5 wing from Louisville. \nAs usual, the Bulldogs' non-conference road schedule includes heavyweights like Tennessee (season opener Nov. 13), Texas A&M and Georgetown, along with three games in the Great Alaskan Shootout. \nThe home opener at Kimmel Arena is Nov. 18 against Mars Hill. \n\"Right now, we are looking at a lot of different lineups and getting guys used to playing with each other,\" said McDevitt. \n\"We have some players taking on new leadership roles and some new guys trying to do what they can to get in the rotation, so that's been a lot of fun getting ready for the season.\" 37 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1RFkZ4I TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:09:53.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
