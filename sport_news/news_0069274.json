Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY Sports The Miami Marlins are wasting no time this offseason, getting permission to interview Philadelphia Phillies bench coach Larry Bowa, according to reports. Dan Jennings, who left his GM post to assume the manager role midseason, is expected to return to the front office, but his prospective role remains unclear.\nThe Marlins, who have already interviewed Bo Porter and Manny Acta for the manager job, are expected to meet with Bowa on Monday, according to CSN Philly . Bowa was offered a contract for 2016 with the Phillies but has yet to agree to it.\nBowa, 69, has previously managed the Padres (two years) and Phillies (four years), amassing a 418-435 record. In Philadelphia, he never won fewer than 80 games in a season.\nJennings was reportedly told in September the team would hire a new manager in the offseason, but he seems unsure where he would fit in the new front office.\n\"From a standpoint of if I'm asked to go back upstairs, then there's conversations that are going to have to take place because I want to understand where things are -- because I've been removed for 4 1/2 months. There's catch-up that I have to be involved in and conversations that need to take place so that I'm up to speed as to how things have evolved in the front office,\" Jennings said over the weekend, according to the Sun-Sentinel .\nThough the early thinking was the Jennings would return to his GM position, Yahoo's Jeff Passan said that doesn't appear to be the case.\nSources: Significant changes expected in Marlins front office. Plan for Mike Berger to assume GM-type role. Dan Jennings' status is unclear.\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) October 3, 2015 Marlins have accumulated strong base of front-office talent in Jeff McAvoy, David Keller, Marc DelPiano, Brian Chattin. More may be coming.\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) October 3, 2015 Sources outside Marlins organization see changes as positive. Ever since Dan Jennings started managing, there's been significant upheaval.\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) October 3, 2015 But, hey, say what you will about Jennings tenure as manager .... he'll always be the guy who gave us Ichiro on the mound .\nAdChoices Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-marlins/fl-miami-marlins-news-1004-20151003-story.html", "http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/ichiro-rivera-star-outfielder-pitches-inning-in-relief-for-marlins-100415", "https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/650329430028627968", "http://www.csnphilly.com/baseball-philadelphia-phillies/marlins-express-interest-larry-bowa-phillies-make-coaching-changes", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/650326461270781952", "https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/650329016751292417"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:15:00.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
