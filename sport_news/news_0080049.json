The Eagles defeated Santa Fe 25-7 to improve to 3-2 overall, 2-0 in district. Advertisement Willowridge, Ridge Point join Texas City atop 23-5A By Jack Marrion Houston   \nThe Willowridge football team has already tripled last year’s victory total, and the season is only half over. The Eagles stuffed Santa Fe 25-7 for their third win, Oct. 3 at Hall Stadium. \nWillowridge improved to 3-2 overall, 2-0 in District 23-5A. It is the Eagles’ third 2-0 start to district play in four years. They won a 31-29 thriller against Bush the previous week. \nThe Eagles are tied with defending champion Ridge Point and Texas City for first place. The Panthers dropped Bush 55-21 and Texas City edged Marshall 28-21. Elkins defeated Ball 21-13 to improve to 1-1. \nDown 7-0 early, Willowridge shut out Santa Fe for the remaining 44 minutes. Chad Zeno’s first of two touchdown runs brought Willowridge within 7-6, and Jeremiah Sanders’ touchdown produced a 12-7 halftime lead. \nThe Willowridge defense forced six turnovers and took over the game in the second half, with Donald Mitchell and Lakedrick Allen both intercepting two passes. The Eagles added a fumble recovery. \nZeno gave Willowridge an 18-7 lead with 4:29 remaining. Willie Rhodes kept the drives going with multiple long runs, gaining 102 yards on 13 carries. J’Andre Tassain and Rondell Mars combined for seven catches and 116 yards. \nThe Eagles put the game away when Allen picked his second pass deep in Santa Fe territory and returned it for the game’s final touchdown. \nAn improved Willowridge team has five games to clinch its first playoff berth since 2009. Up next is a test against Elkins, Oct. 9 at Hall Stadium. \nRidge Point (3-2 overall) had little trouble with Bush (1-4, 0-2), leading 27-0 after the first quarter. Terry Petry caught a 22-yard touchdown from Shane Gosson, B.J. Rainford ran for two touchdowns and Ar’mani Johnson returned an interception for a score, all in the first 10 minutes. \nRainford had another big game, amassing 174 yards and four touchdowns on 25 carries. Cameron Edmonson was equally successful on nine carries, racking up 83 yards and a score. Gosson threw two touchdown passes, the second to Mustapha Muhammad. \nRidge Point looks to extend its winning streak to four Oct. 9 at Santa Fe. \nCourtland Neal caught a touchdown pass from Wade Freeman and ran for another to lead Bush, which has a key game against Marshall, Oct. 8 at Mercer Stadium. \nElkins football team rebounded from an unexpected loss to open District 23-5A play. The Knights’ defense dominated previously-undefeated Ball in a 21-13 victory Oct. 2 at Courville Stadium in Galveston. \nElkins (4-1, 1-1) clung to a one-point lead with four minutes remaining when Romanon Skinner broke free for a 28-yard touchdown. The Knights had allowed a fourth-quarter field goal as Ball pulled within 14-13, but a fourth-down pass breakup in the end zone was key to maintaining the lead. \nElkins took almost a half to score but took a 7-3 lead into the break on Romellus Skinner’s touchdown run. Shemick Watts added a four-yard run in the third quarter and the Knights held on despite Ball (4-1, 1-1) scoring 10 unanswered points. \nTexas City (3-2) overcame a rally from its second consecutive Fort Bend ISD opponent to defeat Marshall (2-3, 0-2). \nThe Buffalos tied the game with 7:15 remaining on Henry Thomas’ touchdown and conversion receptions, both from Jeremy Smith. But the Stingarees won on a 59-yard touchdown run with 1:43 left. \nSmith had arguably his best game of the season under center, leading the Buffalos with 112 rushing yards and 167 passing yards. He threw two touchdown passes to Thomas and another two Jakobe Sheffield.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:43:32.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
