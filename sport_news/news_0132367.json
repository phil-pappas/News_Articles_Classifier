Right now, the Bills' reputation is that of an undisciplined, overly emotional team that will beat itself with penalties.\nIn a 24-10 loss to the Giants on Sunday, the Bills committed 17 penalties for 135 yards. In two losses this season, Buffalo has combined for 31 penalties for 275 yards as opposed to 16 penalties for 153 yards in their two wins.\nWhile Ryan said he is proud to have a team that will fight for 60 minutes \"right, wrong or indifferent,\" it's clear the Bills have to find a way to limit the penalties. Here's what Bills players were saying about the infractions that are piling up through four games.\nCornerback Corey Graham I mean, it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing to go out there and get all those penalties. I mean, it is one after another. Dumb penalties, situations you just have to shut up sometimes. So it's one of those situations we can't afford to do it, and we can't spot teams all those yards, and we just have to be more disciplined. It's very disappointing.\nHonestly, it is one thing causing something. It's one of those situations where somebody said something or somebody doing something, pushing you or this and that, and then you react, and then you get called for it. And when when you're a team that's known to push the edge, you tend to get a lot more of those penalties, so referees are a lot faster to throw the flag on us because they know us. We're going to play tough, we're going to play physical. I mean, when you do it, it's a chance you're going to get more penalties.\n(The Bills' reputation) does (come into play). I mean, let's not sit here and act like it doesn't factor in. I mean, if it's close, they're going to throw the flag on us. But we have to know that. As players, you have to know that you can't be borderline. If you're borderline, then you're going to get the penalty, and as players we have to be smarter.\nDefensive end Jerry Hughes We'll look at the film and see where the penalties were. Can't really comment on the penalties until we see the film and see what they look like.\nDefensive tackle Kyle Williams I would say that New England was definitely the low point. Because there are a lot of things going on out there today from a lot of different perspectives, you know a lot of things you get in trouble talking about. So we will just leave it at that. Obviously we have to be better, but a lot of people have to be better.\nWe have to play smarter and be better to take ourselves out of situations that we got into today. You know, like I said, there was some things that were provoked today that weren't provoked in New England.\nLinebacker Nigel Bradham Some of the personal fouls, some of them obviously, were a little questionable, but it happens. I mean, that's one of those things we got to do. We got to be able to eliminate those, keep continuing to play on the edge, but there's that fine line between the two.\nCenter Eric Wood We need to play more disciplined and that will handle itself. Just learn from it. We've done that twice where we've really put ourselves in some bad positions with penalties this year. It's got to stop now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:16:06.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
