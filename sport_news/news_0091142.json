But the forfeiture of five Clarksville wins gave the Hawks an extra victory and now Ex-Clarksville High player's family wants answers \nRossview finds itself that fourth team in the region standings and currently in the playoff picture. \nRossview must find a way to maintain that status as the final two games arrive. The first test will be a large one as Rossview plays host to Centennial at 7 p.m. Friday. \nThe Cougars are 5-0 in region play and 7-1 overall. They haven't lost since Week 2 when Class 6A power Independence ran over Centennial 49-6. The Cougars have scored more than 40 points in each game in the past month while holding their opponents to under double-digit points during that time span. \nRossview has won four of its last five games if you include the game against CHS and destroyed West Creek two weeks ago before enjoying a bye week last Friday.

(Photo: George Robinson/The Leaf-Chronicle) \nBut while the Hawks (6-2, 3-2) look to stay on postseason track, Montgomery Central and Northwest are equally determined to get to the playoffs. The two teams play each other at 7 p.m. at Northwest High School Friday. \nCentral also had a much-needed bye week to reassess its season. The Indians were riding high, starting the season on a four-game win streak. But Central has since lost four straight games leaving it hanging on by a thread to that fourth and final playoff spot in the Region 6-4A standings. \nNorthwest is tied in the standings with Central at 1-2 and a win against the Indians Friday would flip the two teams' positions in the standings, meaning it would vault the Vikings into the fourth spot while dropping the Indians down. That would set up all kinds of issues for both teams in the final week of the season next Friday. Montgomery Central faces third-place Hillwood next week while Northwest takes on last-place Creek Wood. \nEvery coach will say that he's only interested in controlling what his team can control and not looking beyond the game this week. But it's hard not to sneak a peek into the future. \nReach Prep writer George Robinson at 931-245-0747 and on Twitter @Cville_Sports. \nFRIDAY'S PREP FOOTBALL GAMES \nTime: 7 p.m. \nRecords: Northeast (3-5, 1-4 in Reg. 7-5A), West Creek (1-7, 1-4 in Reg. 7-5A) \nNotes: The ineligibilty issue swirling around Clarksville High has put this game in a much more important light for Northeast while giving West Creek its only win of the season. The Coyotes won't be going to playoffs but it has to be comforting knowing the season has at least one win on the schedule. For the Eagles, they need to win out (including beating Rossview next week) to have a shot at the postseason. \nClarksville Academy vs. Perry County \nWhere: Linden, Tenn. \nTime: 7 p.m. \nRecords: Clarksville Academy (4-4, 3-2 in Reg. 6-A), Perry County (0-8, 0-5 in Reg. 6-A) \nNotes: The Cougars were hammered by Huntingdon last week but get a chance to take out that frustration on winless Perry County. It's a win the Cougars need and should get. They are currently in the fourth-place spot in the region standings, tied with Houston County and Bruceton. Bruceton plays Houston County Friday, and the Cougars face the Fighting Irish next week in a huge game. If both the Cougars and Irish win Friday, they will have secured a playoff spot and next week's showdown will be moot. \nHouston County vs. Hollow Rock-Bruceton \nWhere: Bruceton, Tenn. \nTime: 7 p.m. \nRecords: Houston County (6-2, 3-2 in Reg. 6-A), Hollow Rock-Bruceton (5-3, 3-2 in Reg. 6-A). \nNotes: This is a huge game for the Fighting Irish, who come off a thumping of Perry County last week. The Irish need to basically win this game to secure a spot in the Class A playoffs for the first time since 2009. They also need a springboard into next week's rivalry game against Clarksville Academy. \nCreek Wood vs. Kenwood \nTime: 7 p.m. \nRecords: Creek Wood (3-5, 0-3 in Reg 6-4A), Kenwood (5-3, 2-1 in Reg. 6-4A) \nNotes : Kenwood is in second place in the region standings and looks secure in the knowledge that it will be going to the playoffs for the fourth straight year. But there isn't much separating the Knights from teams stacked in the middle of the 6-4A standings like Hillwood, Montgomery Central and Northwest. \nDickson County vs. Clarksville High \nWhere: Hilda J. Richardson Field \nTime: 7 p.m. \nRecords: Dickson County (2-6, 0-5 in Reg. 7-5A), Clarksville High (1-7, 1-4 in Reg. 7-5A). \nNotes: Clarksville's use of an ineligible player cost the Wildcats five wins, dropping their record to only 1-7 and basically eliminating the team from a playoff appearance it had wrapped up with its win against Northeast two weeks ago. Now CHS plays for pride despite a difficult week of practice for the team. \nSycamore vs. Stewart County \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nRecords: Stewart County (3-5, 1-3 in Reg. 6-3A), Sycamore (5-4, 3-2 in Reg. 6-3A) \nNotes: As of Friday morning, Stewart County is on the outside, looking in at the playoff race. The Rebels sit in fifth place, one spot from that coveted top four position. To get to the postseason coach Cody Finley's team would need to win out, then get some help, which would be Harpeth losing its final two games. 7 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://leafne.ws/1RZUyHg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:02:06.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
