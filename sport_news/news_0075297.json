It was obvious what the game plan was from the start for the defending 3A state champions. Against county rival Kings Mountain, the Chargers liked the matchups it recognized for its talented array of pass receivers against the coverage. With the Mountaineers cutting off the rushing lanes on the interior for Tre Harbison, Crest put its fate in the capable hands of senior quarterback Willie Green II. Green, who missed last week’s game with an injury, stepped up and delivered a school-record seven touchdown passes for the evening in Crest’s 48-14 romp in the South Mountain Athletic Conference contest. The win pushed Crest to 4-0 in the league, 7-0 overall, and marked its 18th consecutive triumph against Kings Mountain (3-2 SMAC, 6-2 overall). Green, who wound up the contest with more than 450 yards in the air, distributed the football among a number of quick wideouts. He found Tyshun Odom open for three scores, covering distances of 48, 39 and 4 yards. Wesley Bullard was on the receiving end of touchdown tosses of 45 and 23 yards for the Chargers. Also getting in on the pass-catching act were Devonte Huskey, who hauled in a 60-yard touchdown throw, and Harbison who caught a short toss to the sideline and broke it for a 47-yard scoring play. While this was going on, the Crest pass rush led by Justin Foster, Chris Willis and C.J. White made throwing difficult for the Mountaineers. With Shrine Bowl linebacker selection Aaron Ramseur cleaning up most of the activity inside, Kings Mountain was unable to sustain long drives to allow the Mountaineer defenders off the field. Kings Mountain put together its best drive of the night late in the quarter. Already down 14-0, a 21-yard pass from Darren Burns to Jake Merchant set up Ja’ir McCluney’s 3-yard scoring run to cut the deficit down to seven with 10:50 left. But Crest responded with a march leading to Odom’s 4-yard scoring catch, then Odom broke free down the middle to haul in Green’s throw on the 48-yard connection for the 28-14 halftime margin. A 20-point third quarter for Crest broke it open, interrupted only by Merchant’s 3-yard touchdown run for the Mountaineers after they recovered a fumble at the Charger’s 3-yardline. It was a contest marred by nearly 200 yards in penalties between the two teams, which helped turn the game into a nearly 3-hour marathon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:44:17.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
