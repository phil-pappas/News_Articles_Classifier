They have beaten a Pac-12 team in Washington State, and it wasn't a fluke. They outplayed them.\"\nThe question now is if UNT can find the form and drive that McCarney expects and win its first game. The Mean Green haven't really been close in any of their four losses while being outscored by an average of 45-17.\n\"We have to get more guys involved and show the talent that we have on offense,\" UNT wide receiver Carlos Harris said.\nHarris has 27 of UNT's 66 receptions. The Mean Green have shown better balance in the running game with Antoinnne Jimmerson and Jeffrey Wilson carrying most of the load.\nJimmerson has 215 rushing yards in four games, while Wilson has quickly racked up 211 in two games since returning from a broken hand.\nUNT has to hope that pair can help the Mean Green improve their time of possession from a dismal 25:07 a game and help the defense in the process.\n\"We have to make the plays we can make,\" UNT linebacker Calvin Minor said. \"We are capable.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:15:48.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
