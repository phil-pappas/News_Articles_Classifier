They're generally the biggest athletes on the team and get the least amount of love in the public's eye. \nThe offensive line, though, is just as passionate about their job on the team as any other group. \nWhile it's not the allure of catching touchdown passes or being showy with a football that is attractive to them, it's simply performing their most basic tasks — protecting the quarterback and opening up holes for the run game to develop — that drives them. \n\"I love it, it's in my blood,\" junior right tackle J.J. Dielman says about his position. \"When I feel (Devontae Booker) run right off my shoulder, it gives you a good feeling because you're like, I just did that. And he's running hard and trucks some dude, it gets your blood flowing.\" \n\"I feel like you've just got to embrace it. If you've really bought in you'll be happy that your brothers are out there shining,\" senior center Siaosi Aiono said. \"Even though you're not, it's for the team. I think the 10 or 11 o-linemen that we have, we all bought into that, so we don't mind our brothers having that spotlight on them, because we know that they're there to back us up.\" \nIt's an unforgiving job and one of the most repetitive in the game: Use all your strength to contain defenders intent on attacking the backfield over and over again. It's like continually lifting weights, if only those weights were fixed on destroying your actual existence at the same time. Miss one block or lose contain and the entire play is spoiled and the health of the \"skills players\" is in jeopardy with each hit. \nA porous line can negate even the best quarterbacks or running backs in the country, and keep offenses from being consistent or effective. If you don't hear about an offensive lineman during a game, it's because they're generally doing their job and keeping the offense going. And for Utah, the offensive line has been this season's unspoken heroes — the guys in front of Utah's offensive success. \n\"The o-line is playing well, and a lot of that credit goes to Siaosi at center,\" Dielman said. \"He's been a wizard out there. He's been flipping protections and pointing people out, pointing blitzes out. That dude is smart and you've got to give a lot of credit to him because he's the brains of the organization. We just do what we're told when it comes to him.\" \n\"Siaosi is a great leader, not only for the offensive line, but for the whole team,\" senior quarterback Travis Wilson said. \"A lot of people respect him and listen to him. He's a very smart player as well and he picks up on a lot of things. He picks up on a lot of the defensive schemes and is a great leader as well.\" Siaosi Aiono centers the ball during a University of Utah Football scrimmage in Salt Lake City, Friday, April 4, 2014. (Photo: Ravell Call/Deseret News) \nAiono, though, is modest about his role on the offensive line and says all the credit goes to his teammates who make his job easier on the line. \n\"I wouldn't say this is my team, but I'll do whatever I can to help the team. I think they give me too much credit because Travis helps me out, and the tackles help me out, too. They can see the secondary more than I do, so they relay the message down to me,\" Aiono said. \"Ultimately I make whatever call I feel like will help out, and Travis trumps me. But whatever I can do to helps us, whether it's flipping the protection or helping our o-line get to the right spots so we can block the protection.\" \nUtah's offensive line has handled opposing defenses well this season and have only given up seven sacks on the year. Five of those sacks came against the never-ending blitzing defense of Arizona State last week — a relatively decent stat considering the barrage of attacks. \nThe effectiveness of protecting Wilson lands Utah as the best team in the Pac-12 and 13th in the nation in protecting its quarterback. Although the offensive line has been successful this season, seven sacks allowed is seven too many for Utah's line. \n\"I can't even explain how irritating and frustrating it is (to give up a sack),\" Aiono said. \"But we can't let that affect the next play. If it happens, we try to mess up going at full speed. We know that we're not going to be perfect, so we've just got to flesh it and go onto the next play. But obviously we want to be perfect.\" \n\"All of them have a great sense of their goals and what they want to achieve,\" Wilson said. \"I appreciate everything they do for me. They've been protecting me really well.\" \nIn fact, as a sign of appreciation, Wilson takes the offensive line out to breakfast on a consistent basis in a token of solidarity for their protection in the game. \n\"Travis takes us out to breakfast, so I don't care whatever spotlight he wants he can have it,\" Aiono said. \n\"We have a great relationship,\" Wilson said. \"I always try to treat them to breakfast or whatever to show my appreciation for them. And I always try to kind of give back because I know they sacrifice a lot for me.\" \nWilson said the relationship with his offensive line is respectful, with everyone speaking his mind in an effort to improve the overall offense. \n\"They're always giving me feedback and I'm always giving them feedback,\" he said. \"I never take it as them being rude or anything like that, and they don't take it like that from me as well. We all just have great respect for each other and we all just want to get better together.\" \n\"People are like, 'Don't you have a boring job? You block all game,' \" Dielman said. \"It's like no, it's the game inside the game. It's so much more calculated than what people see. I guarantee if people took a longer look at some of the stuff we do, they'd pretty pretty excited, kinda like I am right now.\" Josh Furlong", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:58:21.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
