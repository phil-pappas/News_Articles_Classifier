(AP) â€” New Hampshire Fish and Game officials say they believe the body of a woman found in a river in the White Mountains is that of a missing Massachusetts hiker.\nAuthorities have been searching since Wednesday for 64-year-old Clairemarie Cocuzzo of Westwood, Massachusetts.\n They say a tip came in Friday that someone matching her description was staying at the Gale Head Hut atop Garfield Ridge the night of Sept. 29. That was a week earlier than officials thought she'd arrived in the state to go hiking, and at a time when heavy rains drenched the state.\nAuthorities say the body was found in the Gale River in Bethlehem on Friday. They believe the woman had been swept away while crossing the swollen river.\nPositive identification will be made by the medical examiner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:08:30.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
