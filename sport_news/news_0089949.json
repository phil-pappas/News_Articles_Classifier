In order to solve this problem, an inventor from East Elmhurst, N.Y., designed a special exercise device.\nThe easy-to-use PERFECT SIT UP provides a more comfortable way to do situps. It avoids pain in the buttocks and lumbar region of the back, which allows for more effective exercise. Overall, it promotes fitness, weight loss and abdominal strength. The idea is patent pending.\nThe original design was submitted to the Long Island office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
