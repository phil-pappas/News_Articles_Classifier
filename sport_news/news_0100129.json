(AP) - An electrical surge appears to be the cause of fire that destroyed several hundred bales of cotton and heavily damaged a gin in the Mississippi Delta town of Money.\nLeflore County Fire Coordinator Bobby Norwood tells the Greenwood Commonwealth ( http://bit.ly/1KgzcyP ) that the fire was accidental.\nThe gin was open when the fire started before dawn Thursday. No employees or firefighters were hurt.\nWildwood Gin is owned by the TJ Beall Co., and chief financial officers Tommy Gary says the company will rebuild it.\nNorwood says cotton lint is \"a lot like gasoline,\" and the fire spread quickly. The gin was equipped with a fire protection system, but the fire shorted out the system before it could be used.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
