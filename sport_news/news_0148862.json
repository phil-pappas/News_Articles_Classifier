Could Darius Hamilton’s future be tied to Kyle Flood’s?\nPossibly. The injured Rutgers defensive tackle has been upfront with his support of his suspended coach, and if Flood is fired Hamilton could use his anticipated NCAA redshirt to play his final season elsewhere.\n2. Is the NFL an option for Hamilton if the NCAA redshirts him?\nPossible, but not probable. After playing only 15 snaps against Penn State, the former Don Bosco star doesn’t have a body of work for the scouts to judge. He should be playing for Rutgers or another school in 2016.\n3. How did Brandon Wimbush fare in his debut for Notre Dame?\nPretty well. The freshman from Teaneck, who played at St. Peter’s Prep, completed 3 of 5 passes for 17 yards and ran four times for 92 yards and a touchdown in Notre Dame’s rout of UMass. He’s the Irish’s backup quarterback.\n4. Why are Anthony Zettel’s Penn State teammates rallying around him?\nBecause the senior defensive tackle not only played against San Diego State on Saturday, the day after his father, Terry, lost his long battle with cancer, he had a career-high seven tackles and a fumble recovery.\n5. What will the future hold for Beaver Stadium, Penn State’s home?\nUniversity officials are seeking options to renovate or replace the stadium, the third largest in college football with 106,572 seats, in the next 10 years. They want a newer stadium, which could host more than just football games.\n6. Who did Army use as a motivational speaker for today’s game?\nPhil Jackson. With the Knicks practicing at West Point this week, the multi-championship-winning coach implored the highly underdog Cadets to give a special effort when they challenge Penn State at Beaver Stadium.\n7. What player’s season ended prematurely with less than desired results?\nCornerback Kendall Fuller of Virginia Tech. Projected as a first-round pick, the junior did not play well against Ohio State in the season opener and has now undergone season-ending knee surgery.\n8. What coaches are under fire in a season that hasn’t hit the halfway mark?\nThe heat is back on Al Golden after Miami’s loss to Cincinnati on Thursday night. And Butch Jones of Tennessee is being criticized roundly for his conservative play-calling after the Vols blew double-digit leads in losses to Oklahoma and Florida.\n9. What’s behind Oregon falling out of the Top 25 for the first time since 2009?\nSince Chip Kelly left for the NFL, the Ducks have had very good, but not great, recruiting classes. Plus they failed to come up with a replacement for Marcus Mariota. And, of course, they still play Swiss cheese defense.\n10. What NFL head coach is reveling in Temple’s surprising undefeated start?\nTodd Bowles. The Jets’ rookie coach played at Temple and although he was undrafted, he logged eight seasons as a safety in the NFL. He said recently that he keeps up with his alma mater as much as possible and is rooting for the Owls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:41:32.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
