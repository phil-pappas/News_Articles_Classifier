Norm Wood Contact Reporter #UVA coach Mike London says Williams is the kind of player his team has to try to harass all game long \nThere's never been a time North Carolina quarterback Marquise Williams hasn't been a giant headache for college defenses. Virginia was one of the first teams to experience the full brunt of his impact. \nThe last time U.Va. traveled to Chapel Hill, Williams wasn't quite the quarterback he'd eventually end up being. It was his first game as UNC's full-time starter. \nWearing a No. 2 jersey instead of his regular No. 12 in honor of teammate Bryn Renner, who suffered a college career-ending injury while playing quarterback a week earlier against N.C. State, Williams offered a preview of things to come. \nHe completed 15 of 28 passes for 185 yards and two touchdowns and ran 16 times for 46 yards and a touchdown. A pretty decent day for a young starter, but he added a little extra flash of brilliance not often seen from guys in his position when he caught a 29-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver Quinshad Davis in UNC's 45-14 win against U.Va. \nTwo years later, as U.Va. prepares for its latest trip Saturday to UNC (5-1, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), the 6-foot-2, 225-pound Williams has become the total package when it comes to multi-purpose quarterbacks. He's evolved into the conference's most dangerous all-around threat in his senior season. \nThe 2015 Virginia football season in pictures. \n\"He's a huge weapon,\" U.Va. defensive tackle David Dean said. \"He's smart, he's athletic and runs the system effectively. He's definitely a point of emphasis for us this week.\" \nU.Va. (2-4, 1-1) remains in the hunt in the ACC's Coastal Division, but it's unlikely hopes of staying in the picture would be bolstered by a win in Kenan Stadium, where UNC has won all four games this season by an average of 34 points per game. But two of those wins came against Football Championship Subdivision opponents North Carolina A&T and Delaware. \nThough U.Va. is coming off a 44-38 triple-overtime victory against Syracuse in which the Cavaliers had to face mobile freshman quarterback Eric Dungey, Williams brings experience in a far more furiously paced offense, not to mention a greater assortment of weapons around him to utilize. Virginia coach Mike London on Gene Chizik's impact at North Carolina \nChizik coordinates UNC's much-improved defense and coached against the Cavaliers as Auburn's big whistle in the 2011 Chick-fil-A Bowl. \nChizik coordinates UNC's much-improved defense and coached against the Cavaliers as Auburn's big whistle in the 2011 Chick-fil-A Bowl. See more videos \nIt took until the fourth quarter and the overtimes before U.Va. finally slowed down Dungey, who was 16-of-22 passing for 150 yards and two touchdowns to go along with 85 yards rushing and a touchdown. \nLike Dungey did at times, Williams will keep the ball on some option plays, but he'll also try to get it to teammates such as running back Elijah Hood (545 rushing yards, 6.9 yards per carry) and Davis (team-high 24 catches for 288 yards and a touchdown). \nUNC leads the ACC and is 13th in the nation with 41 plays of 20-plus yards. While Williams has 17 passes of 20-plus yards, that's actually fewer than U.Va. quarterback Matt Johns (20) has had this season. \nIt's the efficiency of UNC's possessions under Coach Larry Fedora and coordinators Gunter Brewer and Chris Kapilovic that has been the biggest killer to opposing defenses. \nUNC is last in the ACC in time of possession (averaging 24 minutes, 48 seconds per game) — a product of its quick-striking ways. In last weekend's 50-14 win against Wake Forest, UNC had five touchdown drives of 65 yards or more, four of which took the Tar Heels five or fewer plays to find the end zone. \n\"He's got five rushing TDs, he's a guy that will run the option, he'll pull the ball on the read play, and he does present a threat that you have to be aware and alerted for,\" U.Va. coach Mike London said of Williams, who helped lead the Tar Heels on a game-winning touchdown drive last season after a crushing U.Va. turnover in UNC's 28-27 win in Charlottesville. \"He's a very dynamic player for them, and we'll have to know where he's at at all times, because everything starts from him.\" \nWilliams, who was recruited by U.Va. out of Mallard Creek High in Charlotte, N.C., has completed 84 of 131 passes (64.1 percent) for 1,127 yards, nine touchdowns and six interceptions this season. He's ninth in the ACC — and 10th in the nation among quarterbacks — with 405 rushing yards (7.2 yards per carry). \nHe's helped choreograph an offense that's first in the ACC and 10th in the nation in scoring (40.5 points per game). UNC also leads the ACC and is 21st in the nation in total offense (482.2). \nIt's the only team in the conference averaging more than 200 yards per game rushing (218.5) and 250 yards passing (263.7). UNC is atop the ACC and fourth in the nation in third-down conversion percentage (50.8). \nLast season, U.Va. strong safety Kelvin Rainey never got on the field when Williams was in the game. Rainey was strictly a special-teams contributor. This season, Rainey will be responsible for helping make some of the defensive calls in the secondary at UNC. \nA concern for U.Va.'s defense is giving up the middle of the field to Williams. U.Va. could designate a player like middle linebacker Micah Kiser, who leads the ACC with 61 tackles and who is tied for the conference lead with five sacks, to spy Williams and follow his every move. \n\"We'll have to make some adjustments to make sure we don't vacate the middle and leave an open lane for him to run through,\" said Rainey, who is part of a unit that's last in the ACC and 82nd in the nation in total defense (413 yards per game). \"Other than that, our defense is going to stay our defense. We're going to have great rush up front, which is going to bring a lot of pressure … so we won't have to worry about him running up the middle.\" \nThere's no guarantee U.Va., which is eighth in the ACC in sacks (14), will be able to generate that sort of heat on Williams. \nHe plays behind an ultra-experienced line, with three players who have at least 29 career starts each, that has contributed to UNC giving up just eight sacks this season. Senior Landon Turner is considered an All-American candidate at right guard. \nWilliams is creeping up on some significant milestones. He's responsible for 76 touchdowns (46 passing, 27 rushing, three receiving) in his career, which puts him three behind the school record set by Darian Durant (2001-04). Williams needs 85 more rushing yards to become only the fifth quarterback in ACC history with 2,000 in his career. \nKeeping him from joining that 2,000-yard list for one more weekend will be one of U.Va.'s primary objectives. \n\"We have to try to keep him in the pocket, make him make decisions in the pocket and take away the quarterback running game early,\" Dean said. \"It's tough to do with him because they can do so much with him, and they have other weapons as well. It'll definitely be a challenge for us.\" \nWood can be reached by phone at 757-247-4642.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:06:24.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
