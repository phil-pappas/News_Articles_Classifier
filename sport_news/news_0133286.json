I simply believe that now is the time to bring the Hurricane Family together and rally behind our young men.\" \nThe news comes a day after the school's biggest loss of all time, 58-0 against Clemson. \nFans this season have been calling for Golden's dismissal. Planes were hired to fly banners over games telling the university to fire the coach. \nFormer Hurricanes players, including defensive tackle Warren Sapp, regularly spoke out about their disapproval with the coach. \nAnother Hurricane player, former running back Clinton Portis, tweeted his disapproval with the decision, however, saying, \"thankful to @GoldenAl for accepting and enduring a punishment that he had nothing to do with. He saw us through tough times.\" \nCopyright   Sunday, October 25, 2015 at 9:18PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:30:33.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
