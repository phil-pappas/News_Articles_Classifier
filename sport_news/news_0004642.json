Sharma Oli was elected as the new Prime Minister defeating incumbent Sushil Koirala in a contest which became necessary after parties failed to forge a consensus amid violent protests over the country’s new Constitution.\nGharti was elected unanimously to the post after the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party withdrew the candidacy of its lawmaker Anuradha Thapa Magar.\nWith the victory, Gharti became the first woman to lead the legislative body in Nepal’s parliamentary history. Earlier she had served as Deputy Speaker in Parliament.\nGharti was backed by the ruling coalition, consisting of CPN-UML, UCPN-Maoist, Rastriya Prajatantra Party-Nepal, Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic and some fringe parties.\nThe main opposition Nepali Congress had also extended support to her candidacy.\nSimilarly, Ganga Prasad Yadav has also been elected Deputy Speaker of the Parliament unanimously. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:40:10.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
