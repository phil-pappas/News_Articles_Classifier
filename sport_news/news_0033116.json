Pacific’s volleyball team hasn’t been productive enough on the right side to prevent opposing defenses from focusing on the Tigers’ outside hitters and middle blockers. San Diego (11-6, 5-1   followed the blue print to perfection in a 25-19, 25-23, 25-23 victory, handing Pacific (12-6, 3-4) its third consecutive loss in front of 600 on Saturday at Spanos Center. “Our goal was to have the right sides beat us, so we put more attention on the middles and outsides,” Toreros sophomore middle blocker Jayden Kennedy said. “So, if they were to beat us, beat us through the right sides. It was like focus on the outsides, then the middles, then the right sides.” Opposite hitter Alexandra Holt didn’t start and played sparingly only in Game 2 and finished with zero kills and two errors on three swings. Janie Feldsher started at opposite hitter and had a career-high nine kills with one error on 15 attacks (.533 hitting percentage). But their threat wasn’t enough to keep San Diego from ganging up on outside hitter Lexi Elman, who had a team-high 10 kills, which for her was a season low, and middle blocker Alicja Wilk, who had nine kills and hit .074. “We’ve got to find ways to keep working with our opposites,” Tigers coach Greg Gibbons said. “It’s just, right now, nobody is respecting the back side. We’ve got to be able to open up that back side because right now, everybody is kicking out on our pins and just staying on the middle with (Wilk).” The Toreros went on an 8-2 run to end Game 1, scored four in a row to take control of Game 2, then came back from a 13-7 deficit with an 8-0 run in Game 3. Pacific had a 23-22 lead after a Feldsher kill on a quick-middle set, but the Toreros scored the next three points on a kill and a block by Canace Finley and Lisa Kramer’s match-high 18th kill. Middle blocker Holland Crenshaw did not play for the second match in a row and has not played in five of the Tigers’ last nine with an injured foot. What started as a promising season has hit a rough patch with WCC foe Saint Mary's up next on Oct. 17 at Spanos Center. “We just have to work through it,” Elman said. “We’re in the process, so things will just look up from here.” — Contact reporter Bob Highfill at (209) 546-8282 or bhighfill@recordnet.com.
