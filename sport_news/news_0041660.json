To him, the conference without the Nittany Lions must seem like ancient history.\nFor Penn State, though, Ohio State is as big a rivalry as it has. Its rivalry with instate Pittsburgh has been on hiatus, though it will resume next year. Despite the fact Temple defeated the Nittany Lions for the first time in 74 years in this year’s season opener, nary a Penn State fan would deign to regard the Owls as a serious rival.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \nThe Big Ten has tried to promote a Penn State-Michigan State rivalry by having them play in the regular-season finale, but it hasn’t really taken off. Like Ohio State, Maryland and Rutgers are from neighboring states, but the Terrapins and Scarlet Knights haven’t had the success that would warrant true rivalry status.\nOhio State has. Penn State has traditionally poached players from Ohio — Westerville’s Ki-Jana Carter and North Canton’s Todd Blackledge might be Exhibit A — though its current roster has only one current Ohioan.\n“If you look back historically at Penn State,” Nittany Lions coach James Franklin said, “we’ve had some great players from the state of Ohio, so that’s something that we’re obviously looking at and want to do a better job there. It’s an area we consider in our footprint.”\nOhio State has had several notable Pennsylvanians, including quarterback Terrelle Pryor. Freshman safety Malik Hooker and walk-on quarterback Justin Cook are the only players from the Keystone State on the Buckeyes’ roster.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nThe Ohio State person most associated with Penn State is second-year Buckeyes defensive-line coach Larry Johnson, who spent 18 years with the Nittany Lions. Johnson, who wasn’t made available to the media this week, always has been appreciative of his time in State College but is equally clear that he has turned the page.\n“He just doesn’t want it to be a revenge game,” Hubbard said. “He just wants to go out and showcase that we’re the best unit in the country. It’s not a revenge thing. It obviously means a lot to him, I’m sure. But he doesn’t want it to be about him.”\nJohnson’s return to Happy Valley was an emotional one for him, so much so that he decided it would be too difficult for him to make small talk with his former colleagues and players and stayed in the locker room until shortly before the game started.\nA year ago, the Buckeyes were heavy favorites against Penn State. But buoyed by a deafening white-out crowd, the Nittany Lions erased a 17-0 halftime deficit to take an overtime lead before the Buckeyes rallied to win in double overtime.\nA second loss would have ended Ohio State’s national championship hopes, and the Buckeyes’ escape is regarded as a key turning point.\nOhio State hoped that its “Dark Night” crowd, with the wearing of black alternate uniforms, will have given the Buckeyes the same type of lift that Penn State benefited from last year.\nLike in 2014, Ohio State entered the game as a solid favorite. But Penn State has the 10th-ranked defense nationally and has a talented, if underachieving, quarterback in Christian Hackenberg. After the Temple loss, the Nittany Lions have won five straight.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \n“They’re always going to come to play, especially in a prime-time game against the Buckeyes,” Ohio State receiver Jalin Marshall said. “Their defense has always been great, and I think they’re going to step it up another notch to play us.\n“We have to be prepared for everything they’re going to throw at us, which is a lot.”\nbrabinowitz@dispatch.com \n@brdispatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:36:09.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
