And a 3-2 loss at BATE Borisov on Tuesday extended Roma's winless streak in the Champions League to seven matches, stretching back to last season. \nAfter the loss in Belarus, Garcia acknowledged he used the wrong lineup, influenced by several injuries. \n\"I made a mistake because we were off kilter,\" Garcia said. \nA day later, Garcia's girlfriend and host on Roma's official TV station Francesca Brienza acknowledged, \"Ancelotti's name is being mentioned but I'm not sure he would want to take over this ship.\" \nAncelotti, who was fired by Real Madrid at the end of last season, was a player on the Roma squad that won the 1983 Serie A title and has often talked of returning to the club. \nFour points behind surprise leader Fiorentina, Roma visits 12th-place Palermo on Sunday. \nAlso this weekend, it's: Carpi vs. Torino; Chievo Verona vs. Hellas Verona; Empoli vs. Sassuolo; Sampdoria vs. Inter Milan; Udinese vs. Genoa; Juventus vs. Bologna; Lazio vs. Frosinone; AC Milan vs. Napoli; and Fiorentina vs. Atalanta. \nHere are a few things to know about Serie A entering this weekend's matches: \nJUVENTUS'S TWO FACES: \nWith only one win in its opening six matches, Juventus is already 10 points behind the leaders in Serie A. \nIn the Champions League, the competition the Bianconeri finished runner-up in last season, it's a different story. \nJuventus' 2-0 win over Sevilla on Wednesday kept the Bianconeri on top of their group, following up an opening win at Manchester City. \nJuventus coach Massimiliano Allegri called the Sevilla win \"a first step for a squad that still needs to realize and understand how to play at the highest level.\" \nAfter the departures of Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Carlo Tevez, a big group of new players are still finding their way within the squad. \n\"This Juventus, considering the player's ages, could have a good future, but it's going to have some performances that are not so great,\" Allegri said. \nSALE DELAY \nThe sale of a 48 percent stake in AC Milan to a Thai investor has been delayed. \nThe deal with Bee Taechaubol that could be worth nearly 500 million euros (more than $500 million) was slated to be closed by the end of September. \nBut Taechaubol asked for a delay during a meeting with Milan president Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday. \n\"Work is ongoing and I think it will be formalized soon,\" Berlusconi said. \nMeanwhile, Milan is struggling in 11th place, six points back. \nNAPOLI'S 'DUMP' \nNapoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis labeled the San Paolo stadium \"a dump\" on Wednesday and declared that he is prepared to take the club elsewhere unless the city promises an immediate refurbishment. \nThe San Paolo is run by the city and Napoli wants to eventually build a new stadium. \nMeanwhile, Florence's mayor discussed the possibility of beginning construction on a new stadium for Fiorentina next year. \nAndrew Dampf can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/asdampf \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:02:08.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
