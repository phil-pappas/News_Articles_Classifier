In the worst-case scenario, were Hightower or Collins to suffer an injury or miss any significant amount of playing time, sooner could mean next week.\nAsked about the possible adjustment phase, Bostic responded not unlike how Bill Belichick answers a question that he feels has been asked a thousand times already.\n“Everybody knows what (the Patriots) do here,” Bostic said. “They go over every scenario that we expect to see in a game and as long as everybody knows their stuff, we feel comfortable about what (the coaches are) doing.”\nIn other words, “Tell us what to do , Coach. We’ll do it and we’ll win.”\nSounds easy enough.\nCarryover helps\nLast year, another in-season linebacker addition, Jonathan Casillas, came to the Patriots from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers without the benefit of going through organized team activities or training camp.\nLooking back, even though Casillas had been in the league since 2009 and won a Super Bowl with the New Orleans Saints, he said joining the Patriots in October was by no means something easily picked up on the fly.\n“The thing I had to adapt to was the terminology because at the end of the day, there’s a lot of carryover from different systems and the terminology was all new,” said Casillas, now with the Giants. “I was speaking in English and now I’m speaking in Spanish once I get there.”\nCasillas said it was like another language when defensive coordinator Matt Patricia was speaking to him because he didn’t instantly grasp the terminology.\nWith Bostic, that might not be as tough. Although he played in a different system in Chicago, there are parallels to what he learned at the University of Florida, first under Urban Meyer, who now coaches Ohio State, and then under his successor, Will Muschamp, now the defensive coordinator at Auburn.\n“Definitely a lot of carryover with Muschamp and the way we did everything at Florida,” said Bostic, who with the Pats has been reunited with a former Florida teammate, defensive lineman Dominique Easley. “There’s a lot of carryover that came, even with some of the terminology and whatnot. A lot of the stuff is the exact same.”\nStill, while Bostic may have a bit of a head start in some respects, Casillas said joining a team midseason still takes some getting used to.\n“I compare it to in college when you either forget or didn’t know you had a final that day,” Casillas said. “There is no chance of you postponing this final, so you have to take the final. Your graduation or final grade depends heavily on this exam.\n“So what do you have to do? You have to cram and study your ass off for this test so you, number one, don’t look (stupid), and number two, so you can pass the class. That’s what it was like, just finding out that your final got moved up.”\nStaying power\nDrafted in the second round by the Bears in 2013, Bostic had a lot of characteristics the Patriots seek in prospects. At 6-foot-1, 245 pounds, his 4.61 40-yard dash time was good, but his 3-cone drill time of 6.99 seconds may have meant a little more to Patriots scouts.\nBut those are just a bunch of combine numbers. Whether he could use them effectively on the field is all that mattered.\n“Each of us learns differently,” Belichick said. “Some things we pick up quicker than others, so it is really very individualized between that player and whichever staff members and his position coach are a part of that, getting him up to speed, covering what he needs to know for that game, but also getting him acclimated into all the other aspects of our program, too — not just the plays, but there are a lot of other things they need to learn or fall in line with.”\nBostic’s father, John Bostic, a defensive back for the Lions from 1985-87, preached a lot of the latter intangibles.\n“Professionalism first,” Bostic said. “That’s something that (my father) takes pride on: doing the right thing; being where you’re supposed to be when you’re supposed to be there. All those things play a factor.”\nBostic flashed production in Chicago with 103 tackles in 29 games, but seemed almost disappointed that the cover-2 scheme he played there was more basic. That doesn’t seem to be a problem now.\n“(I have) a lot of respect for the coaches on this staff,” he said of the Patriots. “Even when you’re in other organizations, other coaches talk about these coaches.”\nSaid Casillas: “I don’t even know if I even conceptualized the whole entire (Patriots) defense in the three or four months when I was there last year.”\nBostic knows he isn’t there yet, either, but as he readied for today’s game with the Cowboys, he was already following the Patriot Way.\n“My thing is,” he said, “just to come in, work and get better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:34:55.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
