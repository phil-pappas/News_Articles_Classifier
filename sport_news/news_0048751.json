There Is a football renaissance happening in Harlem.\nThat’s how officials at Frederick Douglas Academy describe it, being that the school’s inaugural football team is the first independent team – comprised only of students from its own school – in the neighborhood in more than 10 years. The now defunct Harlem Hellfighters were a program where players from schools that didn’t have a team could compete in the PSAL.\nThe FDA junior varsity team, led by head coach James Bramble, is off to a 3-0 start, and beginning next season the school will field a varsity football team for the first time.\n“It’s good to see the kids get an opportunity to play football,” FDA athletic director Patrick Mangan said.\nThe Lions, who play their home games at Alfred E. Smith HS in the Bronx, have gotten a good student turnout with 40 players on the roster. Mangan said Bramble and principal Joseph Gates were the driving forces behind the program’s inception.\n“The response has been great,” Mangan said. “Our parents have been excellent. The whole school has pretty much rallied behind it. Credit to Mr. Gates and Mr. Bramble. They worked really hard over the summer.\nIt’s been a whole school-based and community-based effort.”\nFINGERS CROSSED: St. Anthony’s may be running a new spread offense, but not much else has changed for the CHSFL powerhouse out in South Huntington. The Friars, as usual, continue to excel.\nTom Pugh knows. The longtime Holy Cross coach has had many battles with Rich Reichert’s squad during its two decades of dominance. During that stretch his Knights and the rest of the league have looked up at the Friars. Regardless of the offense, which Pugh says makes St. Anthony’s less predictable, he knows Holy Cross is in for a fight Saturday when it hosts St. Anthony’s at Bayside Field at 1:30 p.m.\nThe Knights (4-1, 3-1 CHSFL) are coming off their first loss, a 22-19 defeat at St. Joseph by-the-Sea that was defined by special teams play: an early onside kick from Sea in the first quarter that it recovered and turned into a two-touchdown lead, not letting Cross get its grasp on the football until a couple minutes into the second quarter. Cross had two extra points blocked.\nIf Pugh’s team has any chance at rebounding against St. Anthony’s (4-1, 4-0) Saturday, it likely won’t come down to special teams, but rather how much the speedy Knights defense, led by senior linebacker Jordan Francklin, can contain Friars dynamo running back Jordan Gowins. The junior has rushed 94 times for 922 yards and 11 touchdowns in just five games.\nIt will take a near-perfect performance for the Knights to come out victorious.\n“If you make a mistake against a team that has a lot of players that don’t make a lot of mistakes, that can hurt you,” Pugh said. “You’ve got to play almost error-free football to have a chance to beat them. You make a mistake against another team, you can maybe overcome it. Not against St. Anthony’s.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:11:02.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
