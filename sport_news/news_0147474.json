While it made it a more dangerous fight for Cormier, it was certainly more entertaining as the two put on one of the best UFC main events of 2015 surpassing expectations for the ultimate show.\nAfterward, Cormier said “I just wanted to prove that I’m not one dimensional, I can stand with the best strikers in the world,” and he did just that with his first successful defense of the vacant title he won against Anthony Johnson in May.\nIt was a back and forth war with Cormier’s effective uppercuts and dirty boxing in the clinch juxtaposed by Alexander’s sharp knees to the head and body and sharpshooting from the outside. It was however, Cormier’s relentless forward pressure and sheer volume of strikes that ultimately won Cormier the split decision in a raucous and bloody battle of will and technique leaving both men physically spent.\nThe 36-year-old Cormier represents Monster Energy’s commitment to the MMA category and continued support of the world’s best in class athletes. With eight knock out wins, the former Strikeforce Heavyweight Grand Prix Champion and Fox Sports host has been a dominant force in MMA since his UFC debut in 2009.\nCormier is one of the newest additions to Monster Energy’s elite MMA team joining UFC’s biggest superstar women’s bantamweight champion “Rowdy” Ronda Rousey as well as Featherweight Champion Conor McGregor, Anthony “Showtime” Pettis, Johny “Bigg Rigg’ Hendricks, Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone, Quinton “Rampage” Jackson, Rory MacDonald, Cain Velasquez, and Dominick Cruz.\nFor more on Cormier visit http://www.monsterenergy.com .\n###\nAbout Monster Energy\nBased in Corona, California, Monster Energy is the leading marketer and distributor of energy drinks and alternative beverages.
