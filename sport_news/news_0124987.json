Cabrini Church in Scituate are trespassing on property owned by the Archdiocese of Boston.\n The archdiocese shuttered the church in 2004 as part of a reorganization effort, and the parishioners have occupied it since. In March, the archdiocese sued to evict them.\nIn its ruling, the Appeals Court acknowledged the parishioners’ ‘‘heartfelt beliefs’’ that they are entitled to remain in the church ‘‘as an exercise of their freedom of religion.’’\nBut the court agreed with the lower court judge’s conclusion that they are trespassing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:05:45.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
