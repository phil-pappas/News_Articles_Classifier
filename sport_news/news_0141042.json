Beating a team that is in a rebuilding year by 2 points isn’t very convincing. \nUnless you just landed in Indiana you also know that Colts franchise quarterback Andrew Luck injured his shoulder in the game. In case you were wondering if this was something that happened earlier in the year as Luck hasn’t really looked like himself all year, “It happened in the Tennessee game,” Luck stated on Monday. \nLuck ended the day with 260 passing yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions completing 60 percent of his passes. Frank Gore had a great redemption game from last week’s fumble with 86 yards and two touchdowns on 14 carries — that’s an average of just over 6 yards a carry. That is the Frank Gore the Colts signed from the 49ers. \nAndre Johnson on the other hand is playing like an Old Andre Johnson and not like the old Andre Johnson they have hoped for. Johnson has only had seven catches all year. Donte Moncrief, a second-year player, has 17 catches for over 200 yards and 3 TDs on the year so far. Hello McFly?! \nThe Colts defense has parts that are doing well but had its backs against the wall at the beginning of the season losing two corners in the preseason. The Colts had three sacks with one coming from Robert Mathis, who refers himself to the “Silent Assassin.” \n“It felt awesome. To come out with a win and to get a sack after a year of not getting to quarterbacks, it felt great,” Mathis stated. \nColts’ new addition to the safety position, Dwight Lowery, also had a great game with two interceptions. Lowery was brought in from Atlanta and is known for his big hits and his interceptions. So far this year he has not disappointed. \nThe one thing the Colts do need to work on is the penalties. The Colts had 11 of them for 71 yards but for the year they are 27 for 204 yards. The Colts are currently fifth in the NFL in penalties; it’s very hard to overcome give your opponent free yards. This will need cleaned up for sure. \nIf the Colts didn’t have enough good news the Colts are also on the part of the schedule that they play the entire AFC South schedule in 11 days. That’s three games against your division rivals in less than 2 weeks; not what the training staff, coach Chuck Pagano, the owner or us fans are excited about. \nThe Colts host the Jacksonville Jaguars this Sunday. Kickoff is at 1 p.m. and the game can be watched on CBS if you are not going to the game. The Jags are coming off an embarrassing 51-17 loss to the Patriots. The Jags always play the Colts tough as they see each other twice a year being in the same division. The Colts do hold a 20-8 advantage against the Jags with a five-game win streak. \nThe big question is will Andrew Luck play? My guess is no, due to the signing of veteran quarterback Josh Johnson added to the active roster. Johnson was originally selected by the Buccaneers in the fifth round (160th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft and has moved around to almost every NFL team. If I can I’d like to give a special note to Ryan Grigson: “Please fix this O-line!”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:33:28.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
