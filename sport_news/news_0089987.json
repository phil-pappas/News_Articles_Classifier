The New York Jets ... more > By BARRY WILNER - Associated Press - Thursday, October 22, 2015 \nThe bluster is gone, now residing in Western New York with Rex Ryan and the Bills. \nIn his stead as coach of the Jets is Todd Bowles, who has them off to a 4-1 start in his tenure. New York is the league’s dominant defensive team, has a penchant for takeaways, and will blitz you from the time the team leaves the hotel until the final seconds tick off the clock. \nNow comes the big test, and a chance to make a huge statement. The Jets travel to Foxborough, and a win Sunday over the 5-0 Patriots would establish New York’s credentials as a contender. But don’t expect any outlandish statements from Bowles or his players. \n“I don’t discourage anybody,” he says of holding back what his players say. “I just try to make sure we act professionally and we do the things that we need to do to win. It’s not about talking or discouraging or monitoring guys’ conversations or anything like that. \n“It’s about being mature as a football team and understanding where we are and what we need to do.” \nWhat the Jets need to do is try to slow down Tom Brady. New England barely has been tested so far, and the 38-year-old Brady - who said this week he would like to play another 10 years - needs 43 yards passing to become the fifth quarterback in NFL history to reach 55,000. Brady is 21-6 vs. the Jets, and few quarterbacks can handle the blitz the way he can. \n“They bring everybody,” he said. “So it looks like everybody gets a turn, and they’re just very aggressive with the blitz. They blitz a lot. You’ve got to be prepared for it at all times. They have big guys that blitz, outside linebackers. They’ve got the inside linebackers that blitz. They’ve got, you know, secondary players who are involved, so they come from everywhere.” \nThis week’s action began Thursday night with Seattle’s 20-3 victory at San Francisco. Russell Wilson threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Lockett late in the first half, and Marshawn Lynch jumped the pile for a 1-yard score for Seattle (3-4). San Francisco dropped to 2-5. \nOff this week are three 6-0 teams: Green Bay, Denver and Cincinnati. Chicago (2-4) has a bye, too. \nPhiladelphia (3-3) at Carolina (5-0) \nEach team comes off a big win attained in diametrically opposite ways. \nThe Panthers staged a sizzling comeback at Seattle, making all kinds of clutch plays in the fourth quarter. It could be a defining win for this bunch - provided Carolina gets past Philly. \nIf the Eagles are as sloppy Sunday night as they were in prime time in their win over the Giants, the Panthers, who have nine straight regular-season matches going back to last season, should remain perfect. \nRunning back DeMarco Murray, the Offensive Player of the Year with Dallas in 2014, had 109 yards rushing and a touchdown vs. the Giants and could be ready to break out. \nBaltimore (1-5) at Arizona (4-2), Monday night", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:39:04.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
