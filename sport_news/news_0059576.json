He increased that margin by hitting five birdies for a flawless 5-under 66 to finish with a total of 23-under 261. \nIt was the 28-year-old Sullivan’s third European Tour win after victories at the South African Open and the Joburg Open earlier this year. \nFellow countryman Chris Wood finished second, followed one more stroke back by a three-way tie for third of Anthony Wall, Trevor Fisher Jr. and Eduardo de la Riva.
