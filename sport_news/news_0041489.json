Stewart and freshman cornerback Mike Hughes have been suspended indefinitely from football team-related activities for a violation of team rules, the school announced Thursday night. Based on a release from the school, the suspensions stem from an incident that occurred Oct. 4 in Chapel Hill. Neither Stewart nor Hughes will play in Saturday night’s game against Wake Forest. “We have been aware of this situation since the night of the altercation and have been working closely with the University and Chapel Hill Police to gather relevant information,” coach Larry Fedora said in a statement. “We hold our players to a high standard and M.J. and Mike will face the consequences for their involvement.” By Times-News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:54:07.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
