Romine said the official who ejected Bates told him it was because Bates \"launched himself\" at Brinkoetter. \nRomine didn't agree. \n\"I was told he was ejected because he launched himself upward, but the reality of it is the video shows both of his feet were on the ground on contact,\" Romine said. \"I've sent the video to a number of officials and talked to them and some of them said they would throw a flag for helmet-to-helmet. \n\"My response was, 'OK, but Bates carried the ball 13 times and you could call helmet-to-helmet on every single one.' They said I was probably right. \n\"That's frustrating. I don't think there's a clear understanding on the part of the officials, but I don't think that's the officials' fault. But for something with such a gray area, I feel like they should be absolutely positive on that call.\" \nRomine said he sent an email to St. Teresa coach Tim Brilley and was pleased to hear Brinkoetter didn't suffer a concussion. He said Tuscola wouldn't try to appeal -- \"there's nothing we can do to get it overturned.\" \nTargeting was defined and outlawed by the IHSA in 2014, but Romine said enforcement has been inconsistent and players like Bates make it difficult on officials. \n\"He plays so hard, but he plays the right way,\" Romine said. \"He has a body that allows him to be physical and he plays exactly how I want every kid to play. \n\"I don't know that that group of officials has seen a hit like that, and I think they thought they had to do something.\" \njconn@herald-review.com|(217) 421-7971", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:25:56.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
