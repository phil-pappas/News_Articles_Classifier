Trailing Mumbai by 171 runs and commencing the final day at 244/4, Punjab’s resistance ended in the second session at 403 in 127.2 overs to hand the hosts a much-needed outright win with a bonus point to boot. Mandeep, needing 18 more runs at the start of the day to compile his 10th first class hundred in his 50th match, duly reached the landmark before he was dismissed for 116, made off 208 balls with 13 boundaries, by part-time spinner Akhil Herwadkar. Herwadkar emerged as the surprise package with an innings haul of 6/52, five of which he claimed today. Gitansh Khera kept Punjab afloat with a breezy 86 off 117 balls, studded with nine fours and three sixes, before he was out to off-spinner Herwadkar. Punjab batted much better in the second innings — they were shot out for a meagre 154 in the first innings — but the huge 415-run lead conceded in the first innings sealed their fate. Mumbai, who conceded the first innings lead to Andhra Pradesh at Vizianagaram in their lung opener, bagged seven points to take their tally to eight. Mumbai will take on Tamil Nadu next at the BKC ground while Punjab will clash with Gujarat in Mohali in their next match. Himachal beat J&K by 10 wickets, grab 7 points Dharamsala: Riding on a superb bowling performance, Himachal Pradesh today notched up a 10-wicket win over Jammu & Kashmir to bag seven points from the contest here today. Bipul Sharma (3/50) and Akash Vasisht (4/71) shared seven wickets between them as Himachal Pradesh shot out Jammu & Kashmir for 276 in their second innings, leaving the hosts with just 16 to get for an outright win. Ankush Bains (3) and Paras Dogra (4) then came out to complete the formalities at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium. Ishant bowls Delhi to win New Delhi:Ishant Sharma’s hostile spell in the morning session of the fourth and final day saw Delhi crush Vidarbha by 10 wickets. Ishant finished with a match haul of 9/47 including 3/11 in the second innings to skittle Vidarbha out for 98. Needing 95 to win, Delhi knocked off the runs in 14.1 overs with Unmukt Chand hitting 51 and skipper Gautam Gambhir making 44. Brief scores: Vidarbha 298 & 98; Delhi 302 & 96/0 (Unmukt Chand 51 no, Gautam Gambhir 45 no).
