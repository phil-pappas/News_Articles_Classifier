Jones had allowed just two goals in the Sharks season-opening winning streak and came in leading the NHL in goals-against average (0.49), save percentage (.982) and shutouts (2).\nAlain Vigneault opted to keep the same forward lines and defense pairings that could only score once in the Rangers’ 2-1 overtime loss to the New Jersey Devils on Sunday.\nVigneault’s gambit paid immediate dividends as Staal scored his first of the season 10:36 into the game. Staal’s point shot appeared to ricochet off of Joel Ward.\nNew York continued to attack in what was the Rangers’ most complete performance of the season.\nWhile Raanta did not have to work especially hard, his toughest stop occurred early in the second period as New York was killing a 5-on-3 Sharks power play. San Jose center Joe Thornton attempted a quick shot from along the goal line as Patrick Marleau drove the net, but Raanta kicked the puck away.\nThe save was significant when Zuccarello scored his fourth of the season later in the period. With Rick Nash screening Jones, Zuccarello whipped a shot from the right side into the net.\nFast had a breakaway goal 3:47 into the third period.\nRaanta made a left pad save on Thomas Hertl as the Sharks came in on a 2-on-1.\nStalberg’s goal with 3:16 left ended the scoring.\nNOTES: This was the second of New York’s 17 back-to-backs this season. … Prior to the game, San Jose announced C Logan Couture had been placed on the injured reserve with a fractured right fibula. Couture suffered the injury during the Sharks’ practice in New Jersey last Thursday. He is expected to miss 4-6 weeks. … San Jose D Paul Martin missed his second straight game with a lower body injury. The Sharks also scratched RW Ben Smith and RW Joonas Donskoi. … New York scratched D Dylan McIlrath, RW Emerson Etem and LW Tanner Glass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:27:40.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
