But at the same time, the quarterback is working to ensure he doesn’t feel the pressure, or hear his critics. Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins on the sidelines during the fourth quarter of Sunday’s loss to the Jets (Toni L. Sandys/ The Washington Post) \nCousins last Sunday against the Jets had his fourth multiple-interception game as Washington’s offense faltered, and the Redskins fell to 2-4. Following the loss, Gruden stressed the need for a rebound this week against Tampa Bay. \nCousins agreed, but said he and his teammates need to strike a balance. \n“It’s important, and they’re all important,” the quarterback said. “We don’t feel like – I don’t think it’s going to help us [to] hit the panic button. I don’t think it’s going to help us relax. In the middle lies virtue. You’ve got to have a balance. We do take it very seriously and we know it’s very important. But if we act like we’re going to hit the panic button, we’re all going to tighten up and we’re all going to struggle. We’re always trying to find that perfect balance of the right mind-set. We as professionals understand what it takes, and I do think we have a good group of guys in the locker room that do have that kind of focus.” \nImmediately after the Jets defeat, questions arose about whether Cousins’s poor performance would prompt Gruden to make a change at quarterback. But Gruden said it was his “intent” to stick with Cousins for the remainder of the season. Meanwhile, critics, analysts and fans called for a turn to backup Colt McCoy. Some fans even started beating the drum for a return to Robert Griffin III. \n[ Gruden says he’s not making excuses or babying Cousins ] \nCousins maintains his focus by blocking out such noise. Given the 24-hour news cycle of this day, it would seem hard to do so, but Cousins explained that he has figured out how to do so. \n“The way that I don’t listen to what they’re saying is, I don’t listen to what they’re saying,” he said. “I turn on NPR instead of 106.7 or 980 sometimes. I turn on, you know, HGTV instead of ESPN. I think there are times when you can intentionally block it out, if you’re asking how to do that. I don’t have a lot of social media on my phone so it’s not quite as accessible to me as maybe it is to some other guys. There are ways you can not hear it and it doesn’t do me any good to hear that. \n“I know what’s at stake. I know how important it is to me and the people around me and this fan base and I want nothing more than to help this team get to a lot of wins and a playoff berth and all of that. I’m heart-attack serious about making this happen, and it takes time and it’s going to take some work, but we’ll see how it goes down the stretch here.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:08:58.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
