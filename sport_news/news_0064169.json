He is a Western Michigan commit who is a possible pick in the 2016 National Hockey League draft. \nThe 17-year-old from Troy, Mich., had three goals and nine assists in 55 games last season for the RoughRiders. He had one assist in five games this season. \nIt is important to note Daschke is a senior in high school. Per USHL rules, players in high school cannot be traded without the consent of their parents, meaning this trade was likely initiated by Daschke. \nThe RoughRiders host Sioux Falls on Saturday night at approximately 7:15.
