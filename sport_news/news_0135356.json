Instead of digging by hand and listening for survivors, crews planned to use mostly backhoes and bulldozers to speed up the search for bodies.\n\"The people who could have been alive have drowned,\" said services coordinator Sergio Cabanas, explaining that rescue personnel on foot would be sent out mainly when a backhoe turns up a corpse. \"Ninety percent of it we will do with heavy machinery.\"\nAdvertisement Authorities said about 300 people may still be missing. But they left open the possibility that many of them had simply fled and taken refuge with relatives without contacting authorities, or that they were not in the 125 buried homes when the mudslide struck.\nIt was discouraging news for those who still held out hope of finding relatives buried by Thursday night's disaster, which inundated much of the Cambray neighborhood in Santa Catarina Pinula, a middle-class community of government workers, salesmen, taxi drivers and cooks.\nRescuers carry bodies recovered from the site of a mudslide in Cambray, a neighborhood in the suburb of Santa Catarina Pinula, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015.

At least 16 coffins had been interred by Sunday, and the names of the deceased were etched into the fresh cement used to seal the crypts.\nBut lines of families with coffins, some holding the remains of children, crowded the narrow pathways that lead through the graveyard to the wall of crypts.\nWorkers prepare graves for the victims of a mudslide, at the Santa Catarina Pinula cemetery on the outskirts of Guatemala City, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015.

The drum major was crying so hard he couldn't speak.\nIn all, at least six members of Sandoval's extended family were buried in a long procession of caskets.\nMiriam Cifuentes was at the Santa Catarina Pinula cemetery to bury her older son, Jonathan. She was upstairs in her house in Cambray with her husband and Alex and was just about to go to bed on Thursday night when the mudslide hit. Her older son Jonathan, 16, was downstairs taking out the garbage.\nSuddenly she heard a noise like a rushing river, then like a stream of cars coming at full speed. She opened the window to see what was going on and saw a dust cloud coming toward them.\nA member of a Mexican rescue team and his dog searche victims at the site of a mudslide in Cambray, a neighborhood in the suburb of Santa Catarina Pinula, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015.

Her brother and father came and dug out her son Alex. Firefighters dug out husband, Felix Torres.\nBoth Alex and Jonathan were born in San Jose, California. The family returned to Guatemala 10 years ago to resolve their immigration status with the hope of returning.\nOn Sunday, covered with bruises and scrapes, the family buried Jonathan, the only one they could not rescue. Alex was inconsolable at the thought of burying his big brother.\n\"He was a noble person. Everyone loved him,\" Cifuentes said of Jonathan.\nRelatives place their hands on the coffin of Amilcar Estrada, who died in a mudslide, during his burial at the Santa Catarina Pinula cemetery on the outskirts of Guatemala City, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015.
