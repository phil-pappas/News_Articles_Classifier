The Capitals won 3-2. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP) \nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Alex Ovechkin broke a tie with 4:55 left and the Washington Capitals beat the Vancouver Canucks 3-2 on Thursday night for their fourth straight victory. \nJay Beagle pulled Washington even at 5:42 of the third, and Ovechkin won it with his fifth goal of the season. \nJason Chimera scored in the first for the Capitals, but Radim Vrbata and Henrik Sedin each had a goal and an assist in the second for Vancouver. \nWashington’s Braden Holtby made 23 saves. He stopped Daniel Sedin on a 2-on-1 midway through the third and made a save against Bo Horvat with less than 7 minutes left. \nWashington is 5-1-0 and has beaten Chicago, Carolina and Calgary on its streak. \nVancouver lost its third straight, including a 2-1 overtime loss to Edmonton last time out, to fall to 3-2-2. \nRyan Miller stopped 32 shots for Vancouver. \nOvechkin scored the winner on a fluttering one-timer off the crossbar following a 2-on-1. It was his fifth goal in his five games — he sat out Washington’s lone loss against San Jose after he overslept and missed a practice. \nThe Capitals tied it when Vrbata gave the puck away behind his own net, with Beagle eventually tipping John Carlson’s point shot past Miller. \nVrbata was pointless through six games but skated alongside the superstar Sedin twins for the first time this season. He was rewarded for going to the net at 4:14 of the second when Henrik Sedin’s centering pass went in off Vrbata’s skate. \nVrbata had 31 goals and 32 assists while playing with the Sedins for most of 2014-15, but had struggled to find chemistry on the second line with Horvat early this season. \nThe Canucks grabbed the lead with 5:59 left in the period on the man advantage when Henrik Sedin took a pass from his brother at the side of the net and squeezed a shot between Holtby and the near post for his second of the season. Vancouver’s power play had been 1 for 22 this season, and the goal was the first for the top unit. \nOvechkin nearly made it 2-0 in the first, but was robbed by Miller on a 2-on-1. The goal judge at Rogers Arena was fooled initially, but it was ruled a save. \nNotes: Washington visits the Edmonton Oilers on Friday. … Vancouver hosts the Detroit Red Wings on Saturday.
