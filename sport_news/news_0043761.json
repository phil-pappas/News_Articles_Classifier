We want to get Jay as close [to being healthy] as we can. We need Jay, and that's the conversation I had with him.\"\nRodriguez made his debut last week after missing the first four games because of suspension for violating team rules. He accounted for 57 total yards and a touchdown against Rice.\n\"He's been on scout team for four weeks,\" Partridge said. \"We feel comfortable with him executing.\"\nPartridge said he was most impressed with Rodriguez's ability to avoid tackles. He will likely serve as the backup to starter Buddy Howell against Marshall.\n\"He's able to deny people from getting clean tackles on him,\" Rodriguez said. \"He gets a guy out of positon and he has the power to run through arm tackles â€¦ He's got good hands. He's catches the ball well out of the backfield.\"\nQB also recovering\nAdd quarterback Jaquez Johnson to list of players battling nagging injuries.
