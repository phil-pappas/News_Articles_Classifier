The Jaguars’ Deandre Wytaske scored both of those touchdowns on a 4 yard run and a 56 yard punt return on the last play of the half. Wytaskey was a one man show in the first half as he started the game with a 98 yard touchdown after picking up a fumbled snap to give LBJ the early 7-0 lead.\nCedar Creek would get on the board early in the 2nd quarter on an Erick Vicensio 22 yard FG. Cedar Creek would dominate the time of possession in the first half but the big play ability of Wytaske proved to be too much. The LBJ quarterback would account for 210 all purpose yards in the half.\nThe Jaguars didn’t take their foot off of the accelerator in the 3rd quarter by scoring 3 times on touchdown runs from Wytaske, Isaiah Feaster, and Tyrone Meredith to take a demanding 41-3 lead into the 4th quarter.\nMike Valiksa Cedar Creek’s Peyton Tuggle makes a catch on the road in Bryan. Mike Valiska for Bastrop Advertiser The Eagles would show some resolve in the final quarter by finishing the scoring by capping off a 69 yard drive with a Rey Hernandez 3 yard touchdown to end the night’s scoring.\nCedar Creek appeared to have changed their usual offensive game plan by pounding the ball up the middle against the speedy LBJ squad but couldn’t maintain any long drives that would result in points. Tristan Hendrix would lead the Eagles with 63 rushing yards followed by T.J. McDonald’s 62 yards rushing.\nWytaske led everyone with 142 yards rushing, 71 yards passing and 4 total touchdowns.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/17/4f/b5/CCHS-Football-vs-Rudder-9_11_2015-056.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:39:09.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
