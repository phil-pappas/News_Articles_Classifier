The right-hander's strikeouts tied the franchise playoff record set by Tom Seaver in Game 1 of the 1973 NL Championship Series.\n\"Before the game, I was pretty nervous,\" deGrom said. \"But once I got out there warming up, I kind of settled down. It really went away after the first pitch I threw.\"\nKershaw (0-1) endured his fifth straight postseason loss after giving up the seventh playoff homer of his career. Last season's NL MVP allowed three runs and four hits in 6 ⅔ innings, struck out 11 and walked four.\n\"I got outpitched, plain and simple,\" Kershaw said.\nThree of Kershaw's walks came in the seventh, before Mets captain David Wright had a two-run single off Pedro Baez that put New York up 3-0.\n\"It's been nine years since I felt this,\" Wright said. \"That's about as sweet as I thought it was going to be.\"\nWith a game-time temperature of 92 degrees, both pitchers came out throwing heat. Kershaw, the major league strikeout leader with 301 in the regular season, retired six of his first nine batters. DeGrom, last year's NL rookie of the year, struck out two batters in each of his first four innings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:28:31.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
