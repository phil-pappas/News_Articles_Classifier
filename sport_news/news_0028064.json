In the video, a glossy-eyed-Whitney Beall said that she thinks she's blown a tire and that she's driving very slowly.\nAssuming a tone halfway between bemusement and a realization that what she is doing is wrong, she said, \"I'm f drunk and this is horrible.\"\n\"All the way home people, I'm going to be drunk,\" she said. \"I'm super drunk right now, in a place I really don't want to be in.\"\nAt one point, the 23-year-old woman said she turned right when she meant to go left.\n\"I'm so drunk,\" declared a woman on a Periscope livestream, shortly before she was arrested for DUI Parked at a red light, she told her followers to send her any messages and expressed surprise when she saw 57 people were following her. She said one follower told her to keep her eyes on the road.\n\"I can't even believe I'm Periscoping right now,\" she said. \"I'm not even paying attention to the driving. ... Please supervise me right now because I'm driving super drunk right now.\"\nOther Periscope users urged her to stop driving. Some called the police.\n\"Let's see if I can make it all the way home, people, without a ticket,\" she said at one point.\nShe would not be so lucky. An officer logged onto Periscope and located Beall's car.\nOfficers said Beall failed a field sobriety test and refused to take a breath test. She was released on $500 bail.\nNo one answered a phone number Tuesday listed under her name.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://www.periscope.tv/", "https://www.lakelandgov.net/lpd/"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:03:33.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
