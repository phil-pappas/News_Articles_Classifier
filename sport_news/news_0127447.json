Serving rustic, soulful seafood dishes to stylish city dwellers.\nAT GABRIELA CÁMARA’S flagship restaurant, Contramar, in Mexico City, the dishes draw on a broad palette of cultural influences , but they’re always approachable. “I only serve food that looks like you can make it at home,” she said, “even if, in some cases, it is just an illusion.”\nSimple, nuanced and full of flavor, this recipe, the chef’s second Slow Food Fast contribution, is doable for any home cook.\nThink of it as a sort of Mexican risotto. “In Mexico,” Ms. Cámara said, “to make green rice you blend poblano peppers and parsley or cilantro with broth and then cook the rice.” This version skips the herbs and amps up the poblanos with a good char over an open flame. Ms. Cámara uses Bomba rice, a Spanish variety used in paellas that releases starch as it cooks, binding the dish and giving it a silky texture. You can also use Arborio, an Italian variety typically used in risottos. Pieces of mild, tender sand dab complete the comforting meal.\n“This recipe is as Mexican as it is Italian or Spanish,” Ms. Cámara said. “It is one we made up years ago that works. Cooking is all about experimenting.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS332_SFFILL_1000V_20151012110002.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BI101_SFF_FR_20151020101218.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS332_SFFILL_750V_20151012110002.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:31:23.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
