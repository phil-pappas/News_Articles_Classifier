Sport a Potty and Dung Fu Warrior placed first and second in the world championship, held in Virginia City, Nevada, and all six of the rotary’s entries placed among the 28 entries. The Twain Harte Rotary organized the Royal Flush Crapper Derby in June 2014 to boost revenue for Twain Harte and the surrounding communities. “After the Rim Fire, government shutdown and lack of snow things got really tough. We were trying to find ways the Twain Harte Rotary could help bring more tourists into the area,” said Mike Laurance, 70, a Twain Harte Rotary board member who lives in Mi-Wuk Village. “We all thought it would be so different and unique to do something like an outhouse race. Outhouses are a part of our history because they went hand in hand with gold mining,” Laurance said. A couple members had been in Virginia City a couple years prior to see the outhouse races and thought it could work here too, Laurance said. The rotary’s board of directors reached out to the people organizing the outhouse races in Virginia City to see what it would take to make it happen here, too. The first local derby was hosted at Eproson Park in Twain Harte and saw 12 people register. This year, 25 people registered. An outhouse has to be at least six feet tall, nine square feet and weigh at least 200 pounds, Laurance said. “There can be as many as six people on a team,” he said. “We spent a lot of afternoons and nights working on the outhouses, maybe 20 or 40 hours total,” he said. Many local businesses also entered their own outhouses. “After having so much fun with the local derbies, we decided to go to the World Championship in Nevada City the first weekend of October,” Laurance said. The Twain Harte Rotary entered six outhouses into the 200-foot race. Besides first and second place, the rotary captured seventh with Dry Hole, eighth with Crap Patrol, ninth with Pop and Go and 14th with Card Shart. “We definitely are going back, and a lot of people we competed with plan to come to our race in June,” Laurance said. “We won a great gallon-sized flask,” he said. A parade was held before the derby to showcase all outhouses. There were two people’s choice awards held on Saturday and Sunday for audience members to vote for their favorite outhouse. On Saturday Sport a Potty won, and on Sunday Dung Fu Warrior won. Sport a Potty raced the 200 feet in 11.07 seconds, leading Dung Fu Warrior by two tenths of a second. “We had a great time,” Laurance said. Twain Harte’s Royal Flush Crapper Derby for 2016 will be June 4.
