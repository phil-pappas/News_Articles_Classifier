Everyone had a job to do.” \nFitzgerald went down the lineup, event by event, and assigned each swimmer an opponent to beat and the time they’d need to beat them. When the girls hit the pool on Thursday, they had a clear blueprint for success, but even Fitzgerald couldn’t have imagined her team would execute the plan to such perfection. \nAndover came flying out of the gate and never looked back, starting the meet off by taking first and second in the 200-yard medley relay and extending its lead from there. By the time it was over, Andover had placed first in nine of the 12 events to pick up the convincing 108.5-75.5 win. \n“It was so special,” said senior quad-captain Lizzy Troiano. “We really wanted this, so to all work together and get this, something we all really wanted, it was just so exciting.” \nActon-Boxboro has been something of a white whale for Andover over the past few years. Since the current crop of seniors were freshmen, Andover has only lost two dual meets in the regular season, and both came against the Colonials. \nThe first came in 2013, when Acton-Boxboro beat Andover 95-91 in a meet that came down to the final event. That loss also snapped a 55-meet win streak that dated back to the 2008 regular season finale. \nThen last year, the Colonials beat Andover again 98-88, a loss the Warrior swimmers vowed to learn from. \n“The mindset coming out was what can we do to make ourselves better,” Rudis said. “What can we do to make our team better, what can we do as people to get ourselves up, pick ourselves up and come back guns blazing.” \nAndover went on to win that year’s state championship, edging out Acton-Boxboro along the way, and this week when the girls had a chance to face their rivals head on, they pulled out all the stops. \nAfter Wednesday’s team meeting was over, the girls gathered for their traditional pre-meet pasta dinner. Then, on Thursday morning, they all came to school dressed in army gear, which they then wore to the pool, making sure the Colonial girls could see. \n“We always do Army Day against them,” said senior Nicole Carzo. “We dress up like we’re going to war.” \nFinally, right before the meet began, the girls gathered in a circle at the end of the pool for their pre-swim ritual, a haka-like chant that starts with “We Will Rock You” before evolving into an incomprehensible wall of noise echoing through the building. \nWith that, the Warriors got to work, and from the seniors to the freshmen, everyone did their job. \n“This year I feel like the bar has been raised higher,” Fitzgerald said. “Hearing the noise level, seeing the way this team comes together, they’ve bought into this, they’ve totally bought in to what happens on the team.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:52:14.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
