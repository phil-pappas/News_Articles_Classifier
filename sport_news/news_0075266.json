Bill Wagner Contact Reporter bwagner@capgaznews.com \nOne notable goal has eluded Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds during a record-setting career: a victory over Notre Dame. \n\"I'm a competitor and I want to win. So of course I want to beat these guys,\" Reynolds said. \"At the same time, I understand it's a difficult task and will probably take a perfect game by us. We also have to get a few breaks. That's just the way it is.\" \nAs a plebe, Reynolds saw action at garbage time of a 50-10 blowout loss to Notre Dame in Dublin, Ireland. \nReynolds started as a sophomore in front of 80,000 at Notre Dame Stadium and had a superb performance in almost leading Navy to a major upset. The Midshipmen amassed 419 total yards and moved the ball at will in the second half in a 38-34 loss to the Fighting Irish. \nReynolds led Navy into enemy territory late in the fourth quarter, but an errant pitch led to a big loss on second down and the visitors just missed converting on fourth down at the 31-yard line as Notre Dame escaped. Read the story \nLast season's meeting turned into a shootout with Navy, bowing 49-39 at FedEx Field in Landover. Reynolds directed a triple-option attack that put up 454 yards and the Mids took a 31-28 lead into the fourth quarter, but were outscored 21-8 the rest of the way. \n\"I have a lot of nice memories of playing Notre Dame,\" Reynolds said. \"This is the last time I'll be able to play in Notre Dame Stadium so I'm excited. The atmosphere is unmatched and I definitely remember it fondly from the last time we were there.\" \nNavy will likely need Reynolds and the offense to surpass 30 points for the third straight time in the series in order to upset Notre Dame, which is a two-touchdown favorite. Quarterback DeShone Kizer, tailback C.J. Prosise and wide receiver Will Fuller lead a Fighting Irish offense that is averaging 512 total yards and 37 points. Midshipmen concerned about the overall team speed of Fighting Irish (Bill Wagner) \n\"I know Keenan is a competitor and wants to play well. We need him to play well. If he doesn't, we're going to lose,\" Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \nNavy's triple-option offense has been humming at a high rate, ranking third nationally with an average of 339.8 rushing yards and 22nd in scoring offense with 38.5 points per game. Reynolds has already run for 488 yards and nine touchdowns while fullback Chris Swain has rumbled for 361 yards and four touchdowns. \n\"We know we have our hands full to stop a very potent offensive attack,\" Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. \"We all know about Keenan Reynolds and what he has accomplished in NCAA football. This quarterback has played against us for four years. We're very aware of him and have a great deal of respect for him.\" \nMuch of the pregame talk during the week focused on the fact Notre Dame shut down Georgia Tech's triple-option offense during a 30-22 win on Sept. 19. The Yellow Jackets had their worst rushing performance in two seasons, gaining just 216 yards on 47 carries. \nKelly thinks his defense will benefit from experience against the option. He also agreed with Niumatalolo's assessment that it helps the Midshipmen as well. \n\"There are advantages on both sides,\" Kelly said. \"Certainly, they're going to look at the plan we had and dissect that and look at things they can do to attack it. On the other hand, our guys were able to lock out (on Monday) and line up in our defense and know their keys and know what to do relative to the option. \n\"There are certainly some things that we're going to have to tweak a little bit, but I can tell you that I'd much rather have already played Georgia Tech and played an option offense than not,\" Kelly added. \nGeorgia Tech, under the direction of former Navy head coach Paul Johnson, runs the same basic option package. However, the Midshipmen employ far more formations than the Yellow Jackets. \n\"Ken is incredible in terms of the formations. A myriad of formations. I mean too many to count,\" Kelly said. \nNavy has flashed many of those looks this season, bringing the wide receivers close to the line in a the tight formation, putting both tackles on one side to create an unbalanced front, lining up in positon formation or having three fullbacks surrounding Reynolds. \n\"Their base is triple option. They're going to operate out of their base and there will be counter option and there will be lead toss, and they're going to throw the football and there's going to be some gadget plays,\" Kelly said. \"But it's formationing you in so many different ways that you have to look at all of those things and get into the right defensive looks because it becomes a numbers game if you're not in the right alignments.\" \nImportant matchups will take place in the trenches where center Blaze Ryder, left guard E.J. Binns and the rest of the Navy offensive line must get movement against a big front four. Notre Dame's Daniel Cage weighs 315 pounds while fellow defensive tackle Sheldon Day (6-2, 285) has been described as a run stuffer and is considered a potential first-round NFL draft pick. \nNotre Dame linebackers Jaylon Smith and Joe Schmidt, who have recorded 38 and 29 tackles, respectively. Schmidt led the Irish in tackles through eight games a year ago before suffering a season-ending injury while Smith finished as the team's top tackler with 112. \n\"It's going to be a tough challenge. They're big and they're fast,\" Reynolds said. \"Jaylon Smith can shut down a whole side of the field. You have to run away from him.\" \nNavy has won the time of possession battle in each of the last two meetings, holding the ball for 37:36 two years ago in South Bend and for 33:07 last season in Landover. The Midshipmen did not commit a penalty or turnover in 2013. \nTurnovers were a problem for the Mids last season, but they have just one so far this season. \n\"It's a priority each and every week, but especially this week. We can't give them extra turns or put our defense in a bind with short fields,\" Reynolds said. \nNAVY @ NOTRE DAME", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:04:29.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
