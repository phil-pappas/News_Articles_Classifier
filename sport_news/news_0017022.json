Nevada memo: DraftKings described self as gambling Associated Press | 0 comments \nLAS VEGAS (AP) â€” Nevada says daily fantasy sports sites like DraftKings and FanDuel are gambling and are using the company's own words as evidence. \nNevada's office of the attorney general cited a three-year-old online \"Ask Me Anything\" interview on Reddit.com where it said DraftKings CEO Jason Robins compared his site to a casino and described the concept as a mashup between poker and fantasy sports. \nThe agency notes the remarks in a 16-page legal opinion memo issued Friday supporting the state's decision the day before ordering daily fantasy sites to get a gambling license or get out. \nA transcript of the interview transcript that remains online doesn't identify Robins by name. \nDraftKings and other fantasy sports sites have insisted they aren't gambling and instead skill-based games exempt under a 2006 federal law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:29:11.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
