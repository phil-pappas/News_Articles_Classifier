Some pitchers are still getting acclimated to the mound and their stuff that day, too. \nSuch concerns, however, didn’t apply to Chicago Cubs ace Jake Arrieta, whose preparation is legendary. The right-hander yielded only six runs in that frame all season, tied for his fewest among the first six innings he nearly always completed. \nThe Mets, meanwhile, were the atypical lineup that peaked in the mid-to-late innings; their 74 first-inning runs ranked 25th in baseball. \nThose were regular-season statistics and thus don’t include Daniel Murphy’s metamorphosis into “the best hitter on the planet,” as Cubs catcher Miguel Montero quipped. Murphy’s two-run homer capped a three-up, three-in start to the game as New York took a 3-0 lead en route to a 4-1 victory in NLCS Game 2. \n“I put us in a pretty big hole there in the first,” Arrieta said. “It was one that was just a little too hard to overcome.” \n• BOX SCORE : Mets 4, Cubs 1 \nTake Arrieta’s last nine regular season outings, plus his NL wild card start, and he allowed only two total earned runs in 76 innings. He even threw a no-hitter. He hadn’t given up three in the first inning since July 30, 2010 — back when he was a struggling rookie pitcher for the Orioles. He lasted only five innings and gave up four earned runs, both of which matched seasons worsts. \nWhile the Mets’ enviable rotation goes four-deep with top-flight pitchers — All-Star Jacob deGrom pitches Game 3 and highly-regarded prospect Steven Matz takes the ball in Game 4 — Chicago now turns to Kyle Hendricks and Jason Hammel for their next two games while trailing 2-0 in the series in games started by their two elite pitchers, Arrieta and Jon Lester. \nHendricks, a former eighth-round pick out of Dartmouth, had a 3.95 ERA in 32 starts. His 3.9 strikeout-to-walk ratio ranked 13th among NL starters, but his ERA+ — which is adjusted for league and ballpark — suggested he was only a league-average pitcher. \n“He really dissects everything, so he knows exactly what he wants to do and it's up to execution,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. “What he does, (what) he really creates when he's right, it's a good angle to the plate and the ball really moves off that angle and has a lot of sink to it. . . . He elicits a lot of weak contact, and when the other pitches are on, that's when the strikeouts show up.” \nChicago Cubs starting pitcher Jake Arrieta (49) talks with catcher Miguel Montero in the third inning against the New York Mets in game two of the NLCS at Citi Field (Photo: Anthony Gruppuso-USA TODAY Sports) \nHendricks and Hammel lasted only 4 2/3 and 3 innings, respectively, in their NLDS starts against the St. Louis Cardinals, and Maddon will again have the luxury of several starters-turned-relievers to bridge the middle innings with left-handers Travis Wood and Clayton Richard and right-hander Trevor Cahill. \nShould the Cubs push the series to a sixth game, they’ll have to wonder which Arrieta will show up — the one who went 17-1 with a 0.81 ERA and five complete games in 21 starts from the summer solstice through the NL wild card game? Or the one who failed to complete the sixth inning in two playoff starts since, allowing four runs in back-to-back outings for the first time since early May? \nThe truth is, Arrieta pitched well against the Mets if not for the remarkable Murphy homer on a practically shoestring curveball, which was the third-lowest pitch knocked out of the yard all season. \n“It wasn’t that bad of a pitch,” Arrieta said. “He’s just swinging the bat tremendously right now.” \nAfterwards, Arrieta allowed just one run in five innings with eight strikeouts. His average velocity was down about one mph on his fastball, but his top speed was down two, from 98 to 96. \n“Physically I felt fine,” he said. “I knew the high-end velo wasn’t necessarily there tonight. I threw quite a few change ups to kind of offset that.” \nArrieta threw twice as many change ups as usual, beginning later in that inning. Game 2 was a rare night when he wasn’t economical with his pitches, needing 19 per inning compared to the 15 he required for every three outs in the regular season, which ranked eighth in the NL for efficiency. \n“The thing about Jake that I take a lot of stock in is the fact if you've ever seen the guy work out, I mean, this guy really his workout regimen is different,” Maddon said. “He's as in-shape as anybody that's ever played this game. “ \nArrieta spoke with resolve that, with the series returning home to Wrigley Field, he would get a chance to start another time in a Game 6 back at Citi Field. \n“The ball will be in my hand again,” he said.
