All-Canadian goalie Lindsay Post (20-6-1 with a 1.18 goals against average and .940 save percentage last season) and leading point-scorer Hannah Olenyk (10 goals, 15 assists in 28 games) are among the returnees, six of whom are seniors, from the lineup that swept Manitoba 2-0 in the Canada West championship before losing in the CIS championship quarterfinal round. \n“We’ve got a very strong mix of veteran players, we’ve got a very strong core of girls that are in their last years, so they’re going to bring that extra motivation to chase something great in their final season (along with) all the leadership and experience that they bring,” said Draper. \n“And then we’ve got a young core of girls that really have contributed to the energy on our team and the speed and the intelligence. We lost some very strong players from last year’s squad but I think with this new crew we’ve got a little bit extra hockey intelligence and it’s showing up.” \nIn their season-opening games at Manitoba last weekend, the Pandas lost 2-1 before winning 4-0 as rookie goaltender Dayna Owen made 16 saves for the shutout and third-year blueliner Morgan Kelly had two assists and was plus-four. \n“I really like how we responded and our second game was very strong,” Draper said. “It felt like our work ethic was a lot higher and players kept things more simple, which I think is often a factor of a higher degree of confidence. \n“Our team play was very strong and our goaltending was strong, it seemed like all the pieces came together. So it’s a very exciting start and we’re looking forward to diving into the rest of the season and seeing how this team develops.” \nAs part of the home-opening festivities, the Pandas are participating in IIHF World Girls Ice Hockey Weekend. Kids will receive free admission to Saturday’s game, and on Sunday the team will host a free Fun Day event, allowing females aged 4 to 94 who have never played hockey to give the game a try. Among the participants signed up are students from Australia, Saudi Arabia and Syria. \n“I think it’s part of our responsibility to try and help grow hockey,” said Draper. “Over the years we’ve done our best to try and do it locally, but this is a chance to spread it across the globe in our own little way and share what we think is an outstanding game that can help individuals learn how to be good teammates and good citizens as well as learn some new skills and become more fit and better conditioned as a result.” \n@SunBrianSwane U of A TEAMS THIS WEEKEND \nPandas hockey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:41:56.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
