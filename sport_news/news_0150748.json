In the dugout, though, things should look pretty much the same with manager Robin Ventura expected to return for a fifth season.\nAlthough general manager Rick Hahn has deferred questions about the Sox future until after the season (he’s expected to address media before the season finale Sunday), leaving Ventura’s job status open to mild speculation, all signs point to his return after managing the team to three consecutive losing seasons. Ventura would be the first Sox manager to survive such a streak.\nVentura has a year remaining on his contract, is liked and respected by loyal chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and isn’t being blamed by upper management for poor player performance. What’s more, he has been involved in talks with Hahn and vice president Ken Williams about next season and has managed and carried himself around the team and media as one who expects to be back.\nIf a staff change is made, it likely would be among Ventura’s coaches, most of whom are signed through next season. Bench coach Mark Parent’s contract is up after this season, though, and speculation points to Parent, a friend who remains on good terms with Ventura, being replaced, perhaps by a Latin American coach – which the Sox do not have.\n“You have somewhat of a say, but you don’t have full say,’’ Ventura said when asked this week about his staff’s future.\nVentura’s future has at times been a heated talking point in media circles, among talk-show hosts and callers, on social media and among fans calling for change at the top after seeing him lead the Sox to a 295-349 career record, including 74-84 this year, with four games left in the season. Fans were OK after he replaced Ozzie Guillen despite having no managerial experience, guided the Sox to a second place finish in the AL Central in 2012 and finished third in AL manager of the year voting, but increasingly less tolerant with fifth-, fourth-, and possible fifth place in his next three years.\nFan backlash doesn’t appear to be a factor for Reinsdorf, beloved within the organization but, some say, loyal at times to a fault.\nHahn did say before this season that the team he spruced up during a spectacular feel-good winter was playoff material and that Ventura would be held to a higher standard with an improved roster. While Hahn and vice president Ken Williams – the GM when Ventura was hired to replace Ozzie Guillen – both supported Ventura after the team got off to a bad start, Hahn publicly hasn’t let anyone off the hook.\n“We’re all accountable for where we sit right now,’’ Hahn said after the team’s 8-14 start. “That starts with the players, it goes to the coaches and Robin and myself and the front office.\n“To make one individual the focal point? I don’t think that’s fair.’’\nThat said, Hahn also seems to be putting the onus on the players he has given Ventura to work with.\n“Ultimately, it is the players between the lines who bear the responsibility for their own performance,’’ he said during one of the Sox rough stretches this season.\nIt appears as though Ventura will get another chance to get more out of them, although next year he’ll likely get it with less margin for error.\nNOTE: Second baseman Micah Johnson had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Thursday. Scar tissue was removed and the knee was revealed to be structurally sound, the Sox said, and a full recovery with no restrictions at the start of spring training is expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:15:05.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
