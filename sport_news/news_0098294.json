Sweet Pea is expected to deliver first.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nShark bridge opens at Newport Aquarium\n“This is an exciting next step in realizing the goals of our shark ray breeding program,” said Eric Rose, executive director at Newport Aquarium. “Still, pregnancy is not without risk, so we are cautiously optimistic that both Sweet Pea and Sunshine will give birth to healthy shark ray pups.\"\nShark rays, a vulnerable species, are one level from endangered. Threats to shark rays include habitat destruction, pollution, overfishing and the use of their fins for products, including shark fin soup.\nThe public can still see Sweet Pea and Sunshine in the shark exhibit, but they may be taken off exhibit closer to their due dates. They will be moved to Newport Aquarium’s offsite animal health facility in Northern Kentucky.\nNewport Aquarium established the world’s first shark ray breeding program in 2007, when a male shark ray named Scooter was introduced to the 385,000-gallon shark exhibit. In 2013, a second male shark ray named Spike was introduced to the aquarium’s signature exhibit.\nSweet Pea became the first shark ray to give birth while under professional animal care on Jan. 24, 2014.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nRare shark ray at Newport Aquarium is reportedly pregnant\nNewport Aquarium is open to the public 365 days a year and located across the Ohio River from downtown Cincinnati.\nFor information, visit www.newportaquarium.com", "external_links": ["http://www.newportaquarium.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/343b18050fec6ab72d06ae301c6c3f6452ff76f9/r=300/http/assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/839fa56955016338e43e90e5e6ad53fa17ea0753/c=134-0-666-532/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/01/20/naqsweetpeapregnacyb01-17-14.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd487c7e7aa51824ec7f22459ee2d446b200c7bf/c=504-0-2504-2000/local/-/media/2015/04/29/Louisville/B9317166978Z.1_20150429165350_000_GGSAL61LL.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:05:46.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
