On Oct. 15, the Bucs will visit Bloomfield, at 4 p.m. and on Oct. 16, Columbia comes to Belleville for a 4 p.m. start, in what will be the team's Senior Day. On Oct. 19, the Bucs visit University and on Oct. 20, Cedar Grove comes to town. Both of those matches also start at 4 p.m. \nAfter an 8-0 start, Belleville hit a rough patch, splitting its next eight games. Most recently, the Bucs have won two of their last three, defeating Newark Academy and North 13th Street Tech, in straight sets, while losing in three sets to Montclair. \n\"I really think we've gotten past that and are starting to play better,\" said Spina. \"We've made some adjustments to our lineup after losing Kiara Collazo to an ankle injury. Last Saturday, we went to a tournament in Harrison and that was a good setting for our kids to play some solid teams, in pool-play setting and settle down a little. Pool play has no effect on our won-loss record, so it's a good chance for our kids to work on their respective games and get back on track.\" \nVersus Newark Academy, the Bucs won by scores of 25-15, 25-15. Andrea Nguyen had 17 assists and Breana Nieves finished with nine service points, six kills, three aces and two digs. Kristan Lombardi finished with four kills, three digs, and a pair of aces and service points. Gianna Benacquista was also effective, as she had seven service points, six kills and four aces. \n\"I was happy with the way we played against Newark Academy after we had lost to Cedar Grove a day earlier,\" said Spina. \nThe match with Montclair went three sets, 21-25, 25-15, 21-25. The Bucs were without the services of Benacquista, but played well overall. Kara Sica had nine service points, Nieves closed with 11 kills, seven digs and six service points and Giselle Luna finished with 15 digs, six service points and four aces. With some adjustments needed in the lineup, Clarisse Abanilla played well, with three kills. \nIn the win over North 13th Street Tech, the Bucs won, 25-16, 25-16, with Nguyen providing 18 assists and Benacquista, who was back in the lineup, contributing 10 service points, four digs and two aces. Also playing well were Nieves (eight kills, five service points and four digs), Lombardi (eight kills, five digs and five service points) and Luna (six digs, six service points). \nAt the Harrison Tournament, the Bucs won six straight matches in pool play and earned the top seed for the playoff round. \n\"I thought we did good,\" said Spina. \"Our varsity players got a lot of playing time and some of our younger kids also got the chance to play, in a non-pressure situation, and did well.\" \nSpina noted the play of Natasha Sanchez, Cherylann Nicosia and Justine Areola, all talented JV players, who contributed well last Saturday. Abanilla, a junior, was also effective as an outside hitter. \n\"I also saw some good performances from Sica, who served very well,\" said Spina. \"And I liked the way Benacquista and Victoria Bruno played in the middle. We moved Luna to libero and Lombardi was more in a hitting role and she was very good.\" \nSpina is hopeful that Collazo will be back soon. \n\"We're hoping to have her back in the lineup once the ankle gets better,\" said Spina. \"If there's anything good about an injury, it's that we've given some other kids a chance to play and that helps to establish depth. It can only help us as the season continues.\" \nNotes: Seeding for the Essex County Tournament was scheduled for earlier this week. Spina thinks his team could be anywhere from the eighth to 11th seed. \nEmail: Mike051893@aol.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:30:00.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
