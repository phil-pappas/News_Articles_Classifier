There'll be no excess, but we are not going to compromise the essentials.\" \nThe organizing committee's budget remains at 7.4 billion reals ($2 billion), which is for putting on the games themselves. It does not include building venues, subway lines and highways to help stage the games. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:45:59.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
