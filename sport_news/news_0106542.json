He was a three-time MVP.\nThe catcher led the Yankees to five consecutive world championships between 1949 and 1953. He played alongside Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio, leading DiMaggio in runs batted in (RBI's) for seven consecutive seasons (1949-1955).\nNational icon: Yogi Berra. Photo: AP\nHe was an 18-time All-Star, a member of a record 14 American League pennant winners, and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. His number (eight) was permanently retired by the Yankees in that same year.\nAdvertisement He managed the Yankees and the New York Mets each to World Series in 1964 and 1973 respectively. He is one of just six men to have managed teams to pennants in both leagues.\nBerra is known as much for his wisdom as his baseball ability. Famous Quote: s such as \"It's never over til it's over\", \"When you come to a fork in the road, take it\" and \"If the world were perfect, it wouldn't be\", have been attributed to him.\nThe cartoon, Yogi Bear, was also named after him.\nBerra had been in failing health for some time. His death was announced by the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Centre in Little Falls, New Jersey, where he devoted his time and energies in his final years.\nHe is survived by three sons â€” Larry, Tim, a former NFL player with the Baltimore Colts, and Dale, who had an 11-year major league career, including two seasons with the Yankees, 11 grandchildren and one great grandchild.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/vnmykFf9-7w?rel=0"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:51:18.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
