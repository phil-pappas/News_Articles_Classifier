Comfortable living spaces is one of the key issues in this regard and more so in countries like India. The sad fact is that most of the houses in modern urban landscape seem to be built by people who presume that they will never grow old. Missing ramps, high stairs, absence of railings near stairs, lack of sitting spaces in common areas, poor lighting in staircases, signboards in smaller fonts - all of these common features of housing societies just reflect the scant regard for the aged living there. All of these examples only highlight the need to design buildings wherein senior citizens can live comfortably. With a lot being said about \"smart\" cities and homes, it becomes all the more imperative to make these more \"smart\" for the elderly. While a successful aging-in-place home should feature remote sensing and communications tools, interactive testing and medical diagnostic devices, and online access to community support and social activities, in India even the basic things are missing. Murthal based architect Prof. Ajay Monga, says, \"Realty firms must take care of the interests of senior citizens at the time of building their projects. It is really sad that still not many real estate firms are sensitive to their needs. For instance, there are not many building where one can find lifts in which a wheelchair can enter. Height-adjusted cabinets are not provided in bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchens.\" Experts say that apart from lifts, ramp and other necessary things, the new buildings must have bathroom doors wide enough to allow entry of a wheelchair. Though ground reality is very different, several developers claim to be concerned about the needs of the elderly in their projects. \"We see to it that in all our projects, we provide all the possible facilities so that a senior citizen can live peacefully. While designing the housing projects, we keep in mind the interests of people of all age groups. For youngsters, we provide gym, swimming pools inside the complex. And for senior citizens, we provide facilities like reading rooms, round-the-clock security, water softening plants, uninterrupted power supply and maintenance services,\" says Alimuddin Rafi Ahmad, Managing Director of Gurgaon based realty firm ILD group. \"If any customer told us that there would be a senior citizen in his/her home, we make that house senior citizen friendly one,\" informs Nikhil Jain, CEO of Ramprastha developers, adding, \"The rooms where they stay should be well ventilated. Wheelchair-bound seniors must be able to get through the door and have an unobstructed path to the toilet.\" \"All the established realty firms are making enough provisions in lifts so that the wheelchair can easily go there. They make ramps and friendly stairs. That is the least they can do for senior citizens,\" says Sanjay Khanna, director of Kailashnath Projects Pvt.Ltd. Whether these are tall claims or reality is a contentious issue, but here the need to create awareness about their needs is more important. Senior living projects â€” how effective The concept of senior living is also making inroads in India and over the past decade a number of such projects have come up in different parts of the country. Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, Kochi and Goa are the preferred choices for retirement housing properties. Hill stations and pilgrimage centres like Haridwar, Rishikesh and Vrindavan are also popular. Developers who have forayed into projects for senior citizens include Ashiana Housing, Paranjape Schemes and Brigade Group. \"These dedicated retirement housing properties are designed and maintained with focus on the needs of senior citizens. With growing age, they need care and assistance. In senior citizen homes, they are provided with anti-skid tiles, passage ways for wheelchairs, among other features, which make life easier for the elderly,\" says Sanjay Khanna. Ashiana Housing has projects in Bhiwadi, near Delhi, Jaipur and Lavasa in Maharashtra. Paranjape Schemes has Athashri residential housing properties in Pune and Bangalore. The residents of retirement homes don't have to worry about paying bills, security issues and timely medical treatment. There are arrangements for prompt response to medical emergencies by way of doctors, ambulances and tie-ups with nearby hospitals. Some projects also offer continuing care units for their ailing residents. Such homes are available from Rs 30 lakh to Rs one crore according to location and size of the flat. There is also an opinion that retirement residential properties can be a good investment option for the young. The valuations of these properties have over the years grown in tandem with the broader real estate market, in some cases even more. Last but not the least, while there is lot of clamour for affordable housing, one expects that government provide land for apartments for senior citizens, too, in all the major towns and cities on cheap rates. There only senior citizens can buy homes. At least, they spend their twilight years peacefully. While the time for senior citizens is only shrinking as their children are caught up in fulfilling professional or other commitments, there is no denying the fact that we can always provide them comfortable living in the twilight years of their lives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:21:39.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
