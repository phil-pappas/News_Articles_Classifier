Comment Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 3:00 PM Updated Oct 15, 2015 at 3:44 PM By Chris Steele Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 3:00 PM Updated Oct 15, 2015 at 3:44 PM When football teams talk about playing until the final whistle, they are usually referring to finishing the game strong. Playing hard from the opening whistle matters just as much. Despite a furious comeback in the second half, the Green Machine’s slow start was too much to overcome. Geneseo was toppled by rival Sterling 17-14 victory at Chevrolet Field in Sterling. The Green Machine’s offense had been rolling through six games this season, but on the first series of the game Geneseo (6-1, 2-1 NIB 12) looked like a different team. “We were on our heels and they took advantage of the situations and were ready to play,” Geneseo coach Larry Johnsen said. The Green Machine had two-negative plays including a sack on third down before a three-and-out series. Sterling (6-1, 3-0 NIB 12) took possession on the 35-yard line and punched in a score on a two-yard touchdown run from Golden Warriors’ quarterback Sterling Thornton. On the second series, Geneseo had a manageable situation with third down and three but were stopped for a four-yard loss. In the second quarter, Sterling started another possession on the Geneseo 35-yard line. Thornton threw a fade to the end zone for a 34-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Asbury, and the Golden Warriors would take a 14-0 lead into halftime. Geneseo’s put together a drive into Sterling’s territory but the drive ended with a fumble. “We just came out real flat,” Geneseo’s Jake Yarger said. “They have a really great team, but we tried to flip the switch at halftime. We did a better job, than we did in the first half, but it wasn’t enough.” Geneseo played with more desperation in the second half, and the Green Machine seemed to get their feet under them on offense. Sterling won the turnover battle forcing a turnover on downs at the four-yard line, a fumble recovery and an interception. Geneseo put the ball on the turf multiple times, but were able to recover three on the same drive. However, the Geneseo defense was outstanding in the second half giving the Green Machine offense chance after chance to get things going. Quinn Singbush punched in a touchdown from a yard out in the fourth quarter for Geneseo, but Sterling answered with a 37-yard field goal with 5:25 remaining. Down two scores, Geneseo’s Devin Haxby found the end zone with just 12.8 seconds remaining. Forced to onside kick, Geneseo’s Jordan Jackson came up with the ball on the 48-yard line giving Geneseo life with 10.1 second remaining. Daniels passed to Haxby who reached the 20-yard line before being brought down as time expired. Page 2 of 2 - On the game, Geneseo’s rushing attack was held to just 87 yards. Daniels did a lot of the heavy lifting for the offense finishing 10-of-13 for 134 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Geneseo’s only loss last season ended their year. However, this season Geneseo wants to make the Sterling game a watershed moment moving forward with two games to play in the regular season. “I think we just keep remembering the score on that scoreboard,” said Geneseo senior linebacker Justin Scott following the game. “I think we keep that in the back of our minds. It was an eye opener for us.” By Chris Steele", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:52:28.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
