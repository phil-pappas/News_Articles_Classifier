She’s a senior, and now I get to do it with her.”\nThe Kompas, who beat Jung and Reynolds in a district semifinal and Delaney and Steer for the district title, opened their state tournament with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Avon’s Maddie Nakon and Ana Lopez. They then beat Mason’s Isabel Cepeda and Sneha Kadi 6-0, 6-2 in a quarterfinal.\nJung and Reynolds opened by beating North Canton Hoover’s Lynn Daugherty and Sydney Bergman 6-2, 6-3, but they had more trouble in their quarterfinal, rallying to win 2-6, 6-2, 6-0 to set up the matchup among teammates.\n“I think it’s kind of weird,” Jung said of preparing to play the Kompas. “Hopefully we can beat them this time.”\nThe Liberty doubles team opened by beating Cuyahoga Falls Walsh Jesuit’s Skye Harwood and Megan Hissong 6-1, 6-1, then edged Canfield’s Hannah Cianciola and Ashley Kaleel 6-4, 7-5 in a quarterfinal.\n“It’s amazing, since I’ve never even qualified for state before,” said Delaney, a senior. “I’m just so happy. We both just started hitting more balls in.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:24:43.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
