He has articulated, with familiar competence and perspicuity, the government’s stand against the Supreme Court verdict in the National Judicial Appointments Commission case. The gravamen of Jaitley’s charge is that the Bench has allowed itself to be guided by a distrust of the politicians, especially the elected parliamentarians and legislators. Jaitley’s fulminations miss the point completely. At stake is the vitality of an independent judiciary as a robust institutional check against any rampant government, which according to Jaitley, “represents the will of the sovereign.” Let it be recalled that soon after the Constitution was promulgated, Sardar Patel found himself having to offer this advice to Jawaharlal Nehru: “We are now faced with a Constitution…that means for every executive action there must be legal sanction and judicial justification.” Now, Nehru was no autocrat; he was merely impatient to get a thing or two done. His Deputy Prime Minister rather thought that a fundamental point was at work-and, needed to be flagged. Patel’s caution was against an unrestrained exercise of executive power. The need for such caution has been felt keenly and repeatedly over the years, as the executive power seems to have passed on, from time to time, to a group of political leaders whose instincts and behaviour invite definite democratic disquiet. How the politicians in power exercise “the sovereign will” would invariably attract scrutiny, and, course correction, if necessary, from the judiciary. And, politicians-irrespective of their affiliation or ideology — naturally chafe at any suggestion of accountability. Admittedly, there is, on the other hand, a danger of “the Ayatollahs in black robes” over-reaching themselves. Since the Second Judges Case (1993), the judiciary has appropriated for itself a proactive mandate to interpret and intervene in matters executive; often the courts have chosen to invent a maximalist interpretation of their business. But frictions and factions in the political class have prevented any concerted counter-pressure. During the UPA regime, too, the politician was itching to retrieve some space from a self-appointing, self-perpetuating and self-assured judiciary. Post May 2014, it was concluded that a historic opportunity had arisen to “restore” some balance in the judiciary-executive relationship. The itch was-is-to put the judges in their place. And, that can be accomplished only if the power to appoint judges be pried loose from the judiciary. Such a restoration could indeed be desirable, but is possible only from a high moral ground, not from the arrogance of a parliamentary majority. Though it is extremely hazardous to make a guess as to what prompts a certain verdict, it is possible to suggest that perhaps the apex court would have been inclined to go along with the government had there been no “Dadri”. And, more importantly, had there been no disagreeable justifications of that killing. The judges probably could not help noticing that members of the Union Cabinet remain unflinchingly provocative. Arun Jaitely’s respected “politician” would not inspire much confidence as an ideal custodian of the “sovereign will.” It is no coincidence that the shift in the institutional balance that began with the Second Judges Case, too, came about in the context of the horrible leadership failure and despicable political calculations that contributed to “December 6, 1992”. On that day the entire political class — the Narasimha Rao government, the UP government, and the BJP-VHP-RSS combine — had advertised its unfitness to be the guardian of constitutional values and arrangements. The judiciary stepped in and wrested the power to appoint judges. The judiciary had in fact armed itself with the power to ensure its autonomy and independence by denying the politician any say in the selection and transfer of judges. The crux of the proposed NJAC arrangement was not just the intention to rectify the obvious infirmities in the collegium system; there is near unanimity that that the collegium system needs to be fixed. Rather the bottom of the NJAC law is to control the judiciary. Indeed in his powerful dissenting judgment, Justice Chelameswar, had put his finger on the real issue. Justice Chelameswar noted that Fali Nariman, Senior Counsel, who was appearing for one of the petitioners, emphatically submitted that he is not against change of the mechanism provided under Articles 124 and 217. He submitted that this aspect of the matter fell for consideration of the Justice MN Venkatachaliah Commission, which also recommended the creation of a National Judicial Appointments Commission but with a slightly different composition. If Parliament really wanted to change the mechanism for the selection of the members of the superior judiciary, the model recommended by the Justice MN Venkatachaliah Commission could well have been adopted. According to Mr Nariman, the model identified by the Venkatachaliah Commission is more suitable for the preservation of independence of the judiciary than the model adopted in the Amendment. Mr Nariman further argued that no reasons are given by the Union of India explaining why recommendations of the Justice MN Venkatachaliah Commission were not accepted (emphasis added). The Attorney-General, Mukul Rohtagi, was dismissive of the Venkatachaliah suggestion. He asserted that what model would best secure independence of the judiciary was a matter of “value judgment” which could be exercised only by Parliament in exercise of its constituent powers. The A-G did not give any reason why the Venkatachaliah recommendations were not acceptable. It has been pointed out that the Venkatachaliah Commission was appointed by the same but a previous NDA government and that the Vajpayee government had indeed introduced a Constitution amendment on the same lines (viz. 98th Constitution Amendment Bill, 2003) the Amendment Bill could not be passed only because the Lok Sabha was prematurely dissolved. It need be recalled that the Venkatachaliah Commission as well as the 98th Constitution Amendment Bill, 2003, introduced by the previous NDA government had provided for a Judicial Commission of five members with three being the first three judges of the Supreme Court of India, including the Chief Justice of India. Whereas in the offending 99th Constitution Amendment Act, 2014, the Commission has six members (three judges, the Law Minister and two ‘eminent persons’) with a provision that any two of the members could veto a recommendation, even a recommendation unanimously made by the three senior-most judges of the Supreme Court of India. The judiciary was sought to be fixed and it was resisted. There is, no doubt, an acknowledged need to enhance the public’s confidence in the judiciary’s ability to fulfil its obligations to be a true custodian of the Constitution. Yet the fact that the 99th Amendment was passed unanimously by Parliament in no way makes it a wise or judicious proposition. The idea of a Judicial Commission can still be married to that of the collegium system provided — and that is the rub — that the government has no desire to control judges. Only an arrangement which ensures a majority voice for the top judges of the Supreme Court can be seen as a guarantee of independence of the judiciary. But the government wants to control the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. That is indeed the difficulty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:20:29.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
