(AP) — Supporters of legalized sports betting in New Jersey have won a victory in court. \nThe 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia voted Wednesday to reconsider an earlier ruling that banned New Jersey’s attempt to offer sports betting at casinos and racetracks. \nThat means the 2-1 ruling in August is vacated, and the full 3rd Circuit will rule on the case. \nNew Jersey passed a law to allow sports betting but was sued in 2012 by the four major sports leagues and the NCAA. \nCourts have sided with the leagues so far. But the state claims two separate rulings by the 3rd Circuit offer opposing interpretations, making the issue unresolved.
