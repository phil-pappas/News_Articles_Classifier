In Class A Central, defending divisional champion, St. John Vianney (3-0, 2-0) will host two-time defending NJSIAA sectional champion Rumson-Fair Haven (2-0, 2-0). Right now, that game is scheduled for Friday night and is the Asbury Park Press Red Zone Game of the Week. Video highlights of that game will be available at APP.com/redzone Saturday morning. Brick (3-0, 3-0), the defending Class A South champion, will host defending NJSIAA Central Group IV champion Jackson Memorial (3-0, 2-0) Friday night. Lakewood (3-0, 3-0), seeking its first divisional championship since 2000, will play at Jackson Liberty (2-1, 2-0) Friday night in a key game in Class B South. This week the Road Show stops at the home of the Lancers to preview the big game between Rumson Fair Haven and St. John Vianney. \nWith so much up in the air — including game times — here are four things to look for Week 4: \n1. Has the predicted weather already changed the schedule? \nYes. Six games originally scheduled for Friday night were moved to another day.The time of a game already scheduled for Saturday was changed and the time of a game scheduled for Friday night has been moved up. . \nDonovan Catholic (1-2, 1-1) will play at Barnegat (1-2, 1-2) at 4 p.m. today. That game was originally scheduled for Friday night. \nNeptune (0-3, 0-3) will play at Red Bank (3-0, 3-0) at 5 p.m. today. That game was originally scheduled for Friday night. \nThe Manchester at Point Boro game will be played at 5 p.m. today. It was originally scheduled for Friday night. The Middlesex at Asbury Park game will be played Saturday at 4 p.m. The game was originally scheduled for Friday night. Football: Red Bank's Outterbridge earns Game Ball of Week 3 \nAll three games involving the Toms River Regional Schools teams in Toms River will be played on Saturday afternoon. Lacey at Toms River South will be at 3:30 p.m., Brick Memorial at Toms River East will be at 4 p.m., and Marlboro at Toms River North will also be at 4 p.m. The South and East games were both originally scheduled for Friday night. The North game was originally scheduled for 6 p.m. \nToms River South is playing a half-hour earlier than its two sister schools because the school has a Homecoming dance Saturday night. It is the first time in recent memory that there is no football game in Toms River on a Friday night when at least one of the three Toms River Regional schools has been scheduled to play at home. Central's home game against Pinelands has been moved up to 4 p.m. Friday.
