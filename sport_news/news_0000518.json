She is just so smart on the court. It was difficult to play against her,\" Bencic said.\nThe young Swiss, who will also rise from her current ranking of 15, had also beaten former US Open champion Sam Stosur and current number eight Garbine Muguruza on her run to the final.\n\"For me this tournament was a very good step forward,\" Bencic said. \"I think it showed I really belonged to play against top players.\"\nBencic now heads to the Wuhan Open in China where 18 of the world's top 20 will compete beginning Monday, and still harbours ambition to break into the top eight and reach the tour finals.\n\"I think everyone's goal is to go to Singapore,\" she said. © AFP Photo Belinda Bencic of Switzerland returns the ball to Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, during the women's singles final of the Pan Pacific Open, in Tokyo, on September 27, 2015\n\"For sure, I am trying to get in there.
