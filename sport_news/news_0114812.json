Foster’s film, “Be Here Now” (The Andy Whitfield Story), was featured at the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival, winning the prestigious Los Angeles Film Festival Jury Award for best documentary in 2015. \n“Be Here Now” is a feature documentary and love story that follows actor Andy Whitfield who, just like the inspiring and legendary warrior he played in “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” fought a heroic battle against all odds in his own life. The documentary is also about Vashti Whitfield, Andy’s charismatic wife, who supports him throughout his journey that takes place in Australia, New Zealand and, because Andy also explored eastern healing, India. \nLilibet Foster is a multi-talented director, producer and writer for such broadcasters as Discovery, ESPN, Oxygen, A&E and PBS. She has directed “PSAs for Witness,” “Acumen Fund” and “TechnoServe,” and branded content for Apple, Shell, Nike, Mars and Sony. Additionally, her many non-fiction films have won numerous awards. Vapor Valley Questers meets monthly from September through May, with membership in Hot Springs and Hot Springs Village. They enjoy a variety of interesting monthly programs covering many topics.
