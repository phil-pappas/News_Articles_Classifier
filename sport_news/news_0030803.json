The pastor of a megachurch in Singapore has been found guilty of spending $37million on his wife’s pop star career.\nPastor Kong Hee, who founded the City Harvest Church, was convicted this week of lavishing millions of dollars of church funds to boost the career of wife Ho Yeow Sun.\nFive other church leaders were also found guilty in the case which has shocked the country.\nHo, a co-founder of the church who also performed under the stage name of ‘Geisha’, was not criminally charged in the case.\nShe is considered one of the top pop stars in the Asian island, and had previously recruited Wyclef Jean to collaborate on tracks .\nAfter her husband was found guilty, Ho asked church members for their continuing support.\n“Thank you for your unwavering faithfulness in loving God and loving one another. More than ever before, let’s have a unity that is unbreakable,” Ho wrote on the church website .\nFamous for its slick image and wealthy brand of Christianity, the City Harvest Church is estimated to have approximately 30,000 members in Singapore and elsewhere.\nAuthorities began investigating the church in 2010 after complaints of financial impropriety, and quickly uncovered a complicated money trail that showed church funds were being used to support Ho's ailing career.\nChurch leaders had said Ho’s music was a way to reach out to non-believers, but the court found Kong had deceived church members, reported AJC.com .\nPrevious reports also revealed that Ho’s luxury lifestyle also included a $20,000-a-month Los Angeles mansion.\nKong will be sentenced at a later date, but faces life in prison under strict Singaporean law.\nThe judge noted there was no evidence of \"wrongful gain\" by the defendants, but found them guilty of varying counts of criminal breach of trust and falsification of accounts. They are facing lengthy jail terms.\nlhanna@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://newstome.blog.ajc.com/2015/10/21/megachurch-pastor-spends-37-million-to-boost-wifes-singing-career/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twxf2LraoEE"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:48:51.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
