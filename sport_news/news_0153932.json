This year’s race was canceled because of the weather. (Jim Thompson/Albuquerque Journal)\n“Under event rules, we would have to have the balloons in the air by midnight tonight (Wednesday), and the weather all week has just not cooperated and allowed us to launch,” he said.\nPart of the problem was “instability” in the air over and around Albuquerque, some of which can be attributed to the residual effects of Hurricane Joaquin that recently battered the East Coast. “It would not have been safe to fly through that,” Petrehn said.\nThe good news, however, is that the bad weather “is on its way out of here and we should have conditions for spectacular hot-air ballooning for the rest of the week and the weekend,” he said.\nEstablished in 1995, the race is won by the balloon that travels the farthest as measured from launch site to landing site. The balloons are filled with 34,000 to 35,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas, making them much smaller than a typical two-person hot-air balloon, which can hold from 77,000 cubic feet of air to 90,000 cubic feet.\nThe race has only been canceled one other time, in 2009. “The balloon inflated, but the winds picked up and it was not safe to launch,” said America’s Challenge veteran pilot Barbara Fricke of Albuquerque.\n“Of course, we are disappointed,” she said of Wednesday’s cancellation. “It takes a lot of mental and physical preparation to get ready for the race. We’re flying 60 to 70 hours, three nights and three days. I am physically and mentally prepared, but the weather has not been conducive from Saturday until now.”\nFricke, who was to team with fellow Albuquerque pilot Peter Cuneo aboard the balloon “Foxtrot Charlie,” said thunderstorms in the area and downwind made flying dangerous, particularly at night. “You can’t see anything, except the lightning – and you do not want to see lightning.”\nFricke and Cuneo previously won the America’s Challenge Gas Balloon Race in 2001, 2010 and 2013 and have competed in 16 of the races, some of which have taken them across Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.\nThis year’s cancellation affects seven two-person teams with pilots from the U.S., Poland, France, Spain and Germany.\nThe defending champions, Anulfo Gonzalez and Angel Aguirre of Spain, won last year’s race with a 53-hour, 1,189-mile flight to Campbellsville, Ky.\nAnother of the pilots, Andy Cayton of Georgia, is remembered for his first America’s Challenge win in 2006 and a daring flight that took him across the Gulf of Mexico to Florida.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_08oct_norace-283x400.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:05:32.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
