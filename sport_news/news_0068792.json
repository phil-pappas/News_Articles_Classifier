According to a medical update posted by the Red Sox on the team’s official Twitter account, Manager John Farrell’s cancer is in remission. #RedSox Medical Update on Manager John Farrell: pic.twitter.com/kVKBI5nvcQ \n— Boston Red Sox (@RedSox) October 22, 2015 \nFarrell stepped down in August after being diagnosed with stage 1 Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma . Farrell learned of the cancer after undergoing hernia surgery earlier that week. \nFarrell appointed bench coach Torey Lovullo to take over in his place. Both Farrell and Lovullo are slated to return to their respective roles next season. \n“I am extremely thankful for the outpouring of support I have received from the Red Sox, my family, friends and fans throughout this process,” Farrell said in a team statement. “I am also especially thankful for the talented doctors who cared for me in Detroit and here at MGH (Massachusetts General Hospital). I look forward to getting back to work and bringing another championship back to Boston.” Marissa Payne writes for The Early Lead, a fast-breaking sports blog, where she focuses on what she calls the “cultural anthropological” side of sports, aka “mostly the fun stuff.” She is also an avid WWE fan. sports Success!
