Report as abuse Steven Cousler Oct 21, 5:21 p.m. \nUNC was 26-0 in the 1924 season, so yes it is a legit title. Even a roofing company could have made that call, but somehow a tough concept for ABCers. Report as abuse Dustin Baker Oct 21, 5:11 p.m. \nAnd a Helms Title is not recognized by the NCAA either. So yes the article is wrong. They have five NCAA titles. Report as abuse Dustin Baker Oct 21, 5:01 p.m. \nAh yes. The infamously 1924 Helms title that was awarded to UNC 12 years after that undefeated season in which they played in no tournament. Even though Butler actually won a tournament that year. Funny that UNC didn't start claiming that title until Duke started catching up. No one claims Helms titles except fans. Kentucky don't even recognize theirs. Keep claiming a title handed out by a bread company. We'll keep laughing.
