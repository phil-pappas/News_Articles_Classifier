They will focus on doing the same at home against Belle Plaine in the regular-season finale. \n“We had to win and we wanted to win by 13 points to help with the point differential in district play. We accomplished that,” Hawk head coach Mike Parkinson said. “We have to come back next week and play a complete game without the turnovers and penalties we had against North Mahaska. Belle Plaine is a good team.” \nLynnville-Sully hosts Belle Plaine Friday at Sully with a postseason spot up for grabs. \nThe Hawks are 4-2 in district play as is Montezuma while Belle Plaine is 3-3. Those three are battling for the final two district playoff spots. The top four advance with BGM as the No. 1 seed and Colfax-Mingo as the No. 2 seed. \n“We played really well defensively. Our defensive line had a great night. Those guys up front are counted on to eat up blockers so our linebackers can make tackles,” Parkinson said. “Trevor Squires, Jayson Hardin and Kyle Van Dyke do a tremendous job up front for our defense.” \nLynnville-Sully held the Warhawks to 48 yards on the ground and 99 yards through the air. The Hawks’ defense allowed one touchdown, a 33-yard pass from Brandt Fleener to Cole Rozendaal, midway through the fourth quarter. Lynnville-Sully had built a 36-0 lead by then. \nEvan Squires got the scoring going for Lynnville-Sully with a first-quarter touchdown scamper of 21 yards. Noah Engle kicked the extra point. \nEngle hauled in a 9-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Van Zante with 10:21 left in the second quarter to touch off a 22-point scoring outburst by the Hawks. \nSage Ehresman scored two of his three rushing touchdowns of the night in the second period on runs of 1 yard and 2 yards. Engle kicked two extra points and caught a two-point conversion pass from Van Zante. \nEhresman, who finished with 116 yards on 12 carries, broke loose for a 55-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, Engle kicked the extra point. After North Mahaska scored its touchdown in the fourth period, Engle kicked a 43-yard field goal. \n“It would have been good from 50 yards,” Parkinson said. “Noah really put a charge in the ball on that kick. Tyler had another good game throwing the football. Offensively, we played alright, but had a couple of turnovers and penalties which put us off track a bit.” \nVan Zante was 7-of-12 passing for 111 yards. Ehresman caught three passes for 45 yards while Evan Squires rushed for 27 yards on eight carries and made a 37-yard reception. Tyson Vander Linden made one catch for 38 yards. \nCorey McCoy led the Lynnville-Sully defense with eight tackles and Caden Dunsbergen racked up seven stops. Trevor Squires and Carson Dunsbergen each had five tackles. Dylan Roozeboom and Trevor Squires had a quarterback sack apiece. \nJakob Bortell rushed for 70 yards on 30 carries for the Warhawks. Fleener was 4-of-12 passing for 99 yards. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:16:43.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
