After starting 0-2, the Giants have now won three of four. Let's see how these two teams match-up: \nDallas offense vs. New York defense \nSo much has changed for this offense within the last week much less since Week 1 against the Giants. Out is Brandon Weeden and Ron Leary while former Aggie Christine Michael is now going to see more action in the running game. \nWhat do we expect from Matt Cassel? Look for Cassel to be a more polished quarterback than Weeden. When the Cowboys gave up a draft pick to get Cassel you know it was just a matter of time before he saw the field. Weeden was Mr. Check Down and that was definitely evident in the New England game as he threw for only 187 yards on 39 attempts. Cassel is a veteran that has some success in this league which is something Weeden can't say. \nThe running game wasn't terrible against the Patriots, but there is no question that it needs a shot in the arm and that will happen with La'el Collins in for Leary on the line and Michael in the backfield. Michael didn't see a lot of action in Seattle the last two seasons, but he did average 4.8 yards per carry. \nThe Giants defense picked off Sam Bradford three times and recovered a fumble, but allowed 158 rushing yards and 27 points to the Eagles. Overall, this defense ranks 28th in total defense and 30th against the pass. \nDespite giving up a lot of yards to DeMarco Murray and Co., the rushing defense for New York ranks seventh in the NFL as they only allow 93.5 yards per game. Their led by Linebacker Uani' Unga who has 42 tackles and two interceptions on the season. The absence of Jason Pierre-Paul is felt on this defensive line as they only have eight sacks on the season which is tied for 28th in the league. \nA lot of question marks on the Cowboys offense which will make this battle closer than it should be. \nEdge: PUSH \nDallas defense vs. New York offense \nThe Cowboys defense did limit the Patriots to their second-lowest output of the season and are now fully healthy on the defensive line for the first time on the year as they welcome rookie Randy Gregory back to the fold. All-Pro Defensive End Greg Hardy made his presence felt in his debut game as he had two sacks and five hits on Tom Brady. \nOverall, this Cowboys defense ranks 12th in total defense. They rank 17th against the pass and 10th against the run. Four players are tied for the team lead in sacks with two including Hardy. The Cowboys only have two interceptions on the season which is tied for 30th in the NFL. \nEli Manning has limited his turnovers this season as he has four interceptions to 11 touchdowns. His 94 QB rating ranks 13th and he is top 10 in yards and touchdowns so far in 2015. Manning is coming off his worst performance of the season as he threw two picks and was sacked three times by the Eagles. \nThe Giants running game has been terrible this season as they average 3.6 yards per carry as a unit and only have two touchdowns. Odell Beckham Jr. is always dangerous as the primary receiver, but he was limited to five catches for 44 yards in the Week 1 match-up. \nEdge: DALLAS \nKey match-up \nEli Manning vs. Cowboys defensive line: Manning has been only sacked seven times this season, but three of those game in last week's loss to the Eagles. He was only sacked once in the first match-up with Dallas, but the Cowboys didn't have Hardy playing and Gregory was in his first game as a rookie. Look for the Boys to pressure Manning all afternoon. \nEdge: DALLAS \nSpecial teams \nKicker Dan Bailey is perfect on all eight attempts this season. Kick Returner Lucky Whitehead returned a kick against the Patriots for 21 yards and had minus two yards on his one punt return. \nGiants Kicker Josh Brown is 13-13 so far this season including six from 40+ yards. Former Cowboy Dwayne Harris has provided a boost to their return game as he averaged 27.8 yards per kickoff and 7.4 yards per punt return. \nEdge: NEW YORK \nIntangibles \nBoth teams are coming off blowout losses, but Dallas has had an extra week to prepare for this game. There is a big difference between 3-3 and 2-4 for this Dallas team that still has Super Bowl aspirations as Tony Romo alluded to last week when meeting Tom Brady after the game. \nEdge: DALLAS \nThe Cowboys have won eight straight against NFC East foes. \nPrediction : Dallas 24, New York 21 \nEddie Middlebrook can be reached on Twitter @emiddlebrook .
