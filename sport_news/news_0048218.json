And the Minnesota defense is none too shabby as well.\nSunday, Minnesota travels to Denver to take on the unbeaten Broncos, a contest that will be a great barometer to measure whether the Vikes are a legitimate playoff contender.\nMinnesota is getting 61⁄2 points and with its offense going at full throttle figure to be in this game to the final gun.\nTake the points.\nIn other games:\nSUNDAY\nMiami (+1 1 ⁄ 2 ) over New York Jets at London — The Jets came back to earth last week against Philly, and now get to play in London. These are desperate days for the Fish, who are in danger of losing contact with the Pats in the AFC East.\nJacksonville (+9 ) over INDIANAPOLIS — The Jags were turned every which way but loose by the Patriots, but a touchdown-plus head start seems a bit generous against a Colts defense that has yielded 80 points in its three games.\nATLANTA (-6 1 ⁄ 2 ) over Houston — The Texans coughed and wheezed their way to an ugly win over Tampa Bay, but they must pick their game up several notches to challenge Matt Ryan and the Falcons in the Georgia Dome.\nCarolina (-3 ) over TAMPA BAY — Life with a rookie quarterback can be a struggle; just ask Jameis Winston and the Bucs. The 16 points per game they’re scoring won’t be enough to get past the 3-0 Panthers.\nN.Y. Giants (+5 1 ⁄ 2 ) over BUFFALO — Teams that play Thursday nights are tough to beat the following week, so take the points with the Giants.\nCHICAGO (+3) over Oakland — They may have lost 26-0 in Seattle, but the Bears showed signs of life. They’ll be a dangerous home underdog against the Raiders, who historically struggle on the road.\nWASHINGTON (+3 ) over Philadelphia — The Eagles finally broke into the win column against the Jets, but they needed four turnovers to get the job done. With a few extra days to rest and prepare, take the points with the hosts.\nCINCINNATI (-4 ) over Kansas City — Tough spot for KC, traveling off a Monday night road game. Andy Dalton to A.J. Green has been money for the Bengals, connecting for 227 yards and two TDs last week in Baltimore.\nCleveland (+7 1 ⁄ 2 ) over SAN DIEGO — The Bolts offensive line is a mess with center Chris Watt, left guard Orlando Franklin and left tackle King Dunlap all knocked out of last week’s game in Minnesota. Take the Browns and the points.\nGreen Bay (-8 ) over SAN FRANCISCO — There’s something amiss in San Fran, where the 49ers are coming off back-to-back losses to Pittsburgh and Arizona by a combined score of 90-25. Chances are things won’t improve with the Packers in town.\nARIZONA (-7 ) over St. Louis — Carson Palmer is on a roll: He’s won nine in a row as a starter and 15 of his last 17. The Cards will roll over a Rams team that has scored just 16 points in its last two games.\nNEW ORLEANS (+4 1 ⁄ 2 ) over Dallas — With both starting quarterbacks out of action, go with the Saints’ Luke McCown (31-38 for 310 yards vs. Carolina) over the Pokes’ Brandon Weeden (22-26 for 232 yards vs. Atlanta).\nMONDAY\nSEATTLE (-10 ) over Detroit — The winless Lions are having a tough time protecting Matthew Stafford, and the beleaguered QB is in for another run-for-your-life night in Seattle. The return of holdout safety Kam Chancellor puts the boom back in the Seahawks defense.\nLast week: 7-9-0.\nSeason: 24-23-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:24:47.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
