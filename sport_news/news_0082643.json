(Gus Chan, The Plain Dealer) Comments \nCLEVELAND, Ohio â€“ Someone had to depart a winner for the first time this preseason Tuesday night. But for another meaningless night, it wasn't the Cavaliers. \nAs entertaining-less as it might have been for many, the depleted home team remained winless after losing 110-101 to the Milwaukee Bucks at The Q. \nMilwaukee (1-2) overcame a 15-point third-quarter deficit and went on to obliterate the Cavaliers in the fourth quarter, outscoring them 35-23. \nCleveland (0-4) shot an abysmal 35 percent from the field. It wasn't Milwaukee's defense. They just couldn't buy a bucket. \nMo Williams was the team's high scorer with 18 points on 4-of-15 from the field to go with six rebounds and four assists. Richard Jefferson continues to play steadily, adding 16 points and three boards. Matthew Dellavedova contributed 13 points. \nLeBron James, J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov were given the night off. Those electric players in street clothes along with the absences of Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Iman Shumpert and Tristan Thompson made the presence of highlights few and far between. \nThe Cavaliers got off to a quick 9-0 start, but then the game took a turn to the ugly. It was a complete snoozer. A running clock was desperately needed. \nIt's the second time this exhibition season that James and Mozgov were sidelined for rest and maintenance purposes. Smith sat out his third consecutive contest with a sore left hamstring. \nHead coach David Blatt assured everyone that Smith's status is merely precautionary, and it was evident by the shooting guard's rigorous pregame workout he went through with assistant coach Phil Handy. He wasn't favoring his hammy at all. \nJames arrived at the arena to support his team, but later felt ill. After speaking with the team and medical staff, they sent him home before tipoff. \nThe lack of excitement was due to players being out of commission, but Blatt would like to do away with a couple of preseason games permanently. \nHis premise is fewer games should equate to more meaningful games. \n\"I've expressed myself to the people that make those decisions on more than one occasion. My voice is only one, but it's clearly my opinion that we should play four, maximum five preseason games and create a situation where we can have fewer back-to-backs,\" Blatt said. \n\"Players will have a little bit more time to rest and a little bit less wear and tear during the preseason. I think that would be good for the game. I know it would be good for the players and I also think it would be good for the fans.\" \nTuesday wasn't particularly good for anyone. It was painful to watch. \nHead coach Jason Kidd rested his most versatile player in Giannis Antetokounmpo and his best scorer in Jabari Parker. Rookie Rashad Vaughn and Greg Monroe each had 19 points. Monroe all gathered 13 rebounds. John Henson had 16 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks. \nCleveland tries again on Thursday when they host the Indiana Pacers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:05:46.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
