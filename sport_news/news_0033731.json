The latter, who retained his Dutch Open title last week and also reached the finals of the Korea Open Superseries last month, failed to put up a fight against the China Open champion. This victory against an inform shuttler like Jayaram will bolster the confidence of Srikanth, who is struggling to cross the first few rounds in the last three months. \n\nHowever, top Indian women's doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa were ousted in the first round. The unseeded Indians lost to seventh seeds Reika Kakiiwa and Miyuki Maeda of Japan 19-21, 18-21. \n\nFinalists at the Dutch Open, Manu Attri and Sumeeth Reddy made short work of Denmark's Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge 23-21, 21-13. The duo will face eighth seeds Lee Sheng Mu and Tsai Chia Hsin of Chinese Taipei in the second round. \n\nEarlier, Saina struggled to get into rhythm in the first game as was forced to save three game points - two at 18-20 and one at 20-21 - before managing to win at 23-21. Saina, however, slumped in the second and failed to put up a fight after 9-9 as Busanan extended the lead to 13-9. Thereafter, the Thai had it easy as she clinched the second game at 21-14. Saina made quick amends in the third and was cruising ahead at 20-14 before Busanan hit back. Needing just one point to win, the 25-year-old surprisingly let her opponent notch up four points but secured the all important winner at the crucial juncture. \n\nSaina will face another tricky test against Minastu Mitani of Japan in the second round on Thursday. The Indian ace, who needs to at least reach the quarters to retain her No.1 ranking, suffered a surprise loss against Mitani in the second round of the Japan Open last month. Parupalli Kashyap and HS Prannoy will take court later on Wednesday. \n\nResults (Rd I): Men's singles: Kidambi Srikanth bt Ajay Jayaram 21-10, 21-14; Doubles: Manu AttriSumeeth Reddy bt Marcus EllisChris Langridge (Den) 23-21, 21-13; Women's singles: Saina Nehwal bt Busanan Ongbumrungphan (Tha) 23-21, 14-21, 21-18; Doubles: Reika KakiiwaMiyuki Maeda (Jpn) bt Jwala GuttaAshwini Ponnappa 21-19, 21-18. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:53:49.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
