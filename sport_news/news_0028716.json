Yes, the defending champs are solid favorites to claim the division, but last season’s 11-game runaway probably won’t repeat itself.\nThis rivalry continues to be the league’s best, and not just because of its endless drip of skirmishes and zingers. The Warriors and Clippers had the league’s top two offenses and two best point guards, MVP Stephen Curry and Chris Paul , last season. Draymond Green versus Blake Griffin is about as intriguing as a positional matchup can get. Andrew Bogut and DeAndre Jordan are both reigning All-Defensive selections in the middle. Former All-Stars Andre Iguodala and Paul Pierce should thrive in complementary roles as they look to add to their legacies. Steve Kerr and Doc Rivers go about their business in different ways, but both have championships under their belts and both are creative thinkers when it comes to getting the most of their cornerstone players.\n• MORE DIVISION PREVIEWS: Atlantic | Southeast | Central | Northwest\nMost importantly, these two teams bring back virtually their entire casts: Golden State’s biggest loss is David Lee , L.A.’s is Matt Barnes , and yet both teams immediately fashioned plans to compensate for those departures. The combination of talent, depth and continuity sets the Warriors and Clippers apart from the rest of the division. As those two cruise along, the forgettable Suns keep playing the slot machines hoping to find a winning core group, the aspirational Kings do their best to hold things together around DeMarcus Cousins , and the rebuilding Lakers ever so slowly begin to distance themselves from their Kobe Bryant -centric approach to life. 1. Golden State Warriors\n2014-15 results: 67-15 | Won NBA Finals\nOutlook: Golden State’s road to back-to-back titles doesn’t feature any roster turnover-related potholes. In fact, the Warriors will return their top nine players by minutes played last season, including all five starters and key sixth man Andre Iguodala. Matching some of the ridiculous feats last year’s team assembled won’t be easy, but Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson , Draymond Green and company will have every opportunity to recapture the magic.\nNBA 2015–16 NBA entertainment rankings by Ben Golliver", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/bengolliver"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:37:37.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
