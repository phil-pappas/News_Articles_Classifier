When the Lady Bulldogs were part of the Bergen County Scholastic League American Division, it was Tenafly. And when it went to the North Jersey Interscholastic Conference Colonial Division, it was at first Pascack Hills and then Glen Rock. Rutherford was either second or third. \nBut Rutherford might have finally broken out of its bridesmaid status after defeating Glen Rock, 4-1, last week for the first time that Lady Bulldogs head coach David Padilla can recall since both teams were placed in the same NJIC Colonial Division. \nPadilla has been coaching the Rutherford program since 1999 when it was coming in second to Tenafly. \nThe victory avenged a 3-2 loss at home on Sept. 21. Both Glen Rock and Rutherford have one loss in the division and are tied for first. \nWhile excited about the chances for at least a share of a division title, Padilla is being cautiously optimistic. \n\"It will be amazing, but we are not counting our chickens before they're hatched,\" said Padilla after defeating Glen Rock last week. \"All we are looking at is facing Garfield (Tuesday, after press deadline).\" \nIn the first go-around between the two schools, Rutherford was inched out as the Lady Bulldogs lost in the first singles, third singles and first doubles. \nBut in this go-around the third singles and first doubles turned it around and took home victories to go along with second singles and second doubles. \nOne of the biggest wins on Thursday came at first doubles as seniors Emma Knight and Vivian Louie came from behind to take the three-set match, 2-6, 6-1 and 6-4. \n\"I told the girls lets get going,\" said Padilla about his doubles teams after being down in the match after losing the first time around against Glen Rock. \"They decided that it was not going to happen again.\" \nIn addition Knight and Louie came from behind in the third set when they were down 4-3 to win three straight games. \nOne of the biggest contributors this season is junior Danielle Hur at third singles who is 11-2 in 2015. Hur was a substitute last season as she joined the team late in September 2014. \"I knew that she had potential last season,\" said Padilla. \nIn addition to first doubles and second singles, Rutherford won third singles as Alis Vibulbhan defeated Celia Hans, 6-1 and 6-4 along with second doubles as seniors Joanne Na and Apeksha Tripathi defeated Glen Rock's Emma Mangino and Kate Gifford, 6-3 and 6-1. \nWhile its regular season and quest for a division title continues, the state tournament ended for Rutherford as it lost 5-0 at Verona in the second round of the Group 1 North 2 state sectional. \"Verona is a tough team, but I thought we could have taken a couple of matches,\" said Padilla. \"It's something to work up to against teams like this.\" \nDespite losing in both matches, the top tennis player on the team is senior Seo Hyun Chang who is 9-3 on the season. Padilla has seen plenty of improvement this season in Chang who was an All NJIC Colonial Division first team player last season. \"She's been more consistent in her serves,\" said the Rutherford head coach. \nIn addition to Chang and Hur at singles, there was Vibulbhan at third singles. \"She was very consistent today,\" said Padilla about her junior third singls. \"She has worked hard all year.\" \nRutherford had three division matches left starting with Garfield on Tuesday (after press deadline) along with traveling to Eastern Christian Thursday and at home against Hawthorne on Tuesday, both at 4 p.m. Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:41:16.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
