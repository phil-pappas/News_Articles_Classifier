He was all set to assume the leadership of the paramilitary force in the next few months before being called to take up the coveted post of the DGP at a crucial time. Arora and outgoing DGP Sumedh Saini are same batch officers. A mild-mannered, Arora is known as a thorough professional who likes to remain legally sound in his investigation and paper work. Arora, as DGP Vigilance, had introduced bio-metric attendance at the headquarters and district offices, a feat which was yet to be followed at the Punjab Police headquarters and the Civil Secretariat. He has been in the forefront in fight during terrorism and had remained in the thick of action in Amritsar for which he received a gallantry award also. A post-graduate in law from London, Arora is an alumnus of Panjab University, Chandigarh, from where he attained a law degree after graduating from Guru Gobind Singh Khalsa College, Chandigarh. He belongs to Patiala, but had his education in the city beautiful. Arora’s working style is quite in contrast with the outgoing DGP Saini who was flamboyant and hard taskmaster. Arora’s approach in his 33 years of service is to avoid controversies. He also enjoys a clean image due to which the Election Commission of India chose him to head the Punjab Police during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from a panel of three officers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:13:55.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
