The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Taylor is one of South Jersey's top recruits in the Class of 2017. He's mulling scholarship offers from programs such as Temple, Rutgers, Army, Albany, and Harvard.\nHarvard's interest underscores Taylor's academic standing. He's a top student who is enrolled in the International Baccalaureate program at Salem, an advanced track with a focus on independent thinking in a challenging curriculum. \nIB students at Salem also need to choose between participation in the band or choir. \nTaylor chose the choir. \n\"I think he got extra credit for singing today,\" Salem coach Montrey Wright after Taylor ran for 165 yards and a touchdown in leading Salem (5-0) to a 40-13 victory over previously undefeated Pennsville in a West Jersey Football League Classic Division game. \nTaylor has 848 rushing yards and eight touchdowns on 106 carries this season. Beyond the numbers, his tenacious running style sets the tone for the Rams. \n\"He runs with attitude,\" Wright said. \"He's like a man among boys.\" \nPennsville coach Ryan Wood raves about Taylor's physical approach. \n\"He runs hard,\" Wood said. \"He doesn't go down. You better get a lot of hats on him.\" \nOff the field, Taylor is a top student with a strong interest in science - \"I love learning about the stars,\" he says - as well as music. \nTaylor said he's been focused on academics since grade school. \n\"My parents taught me never to settle for anything less than my best,\" Taylor said. \"I know how important the academic side is.\" \nTaylor said his favorite subject this semester is chemistry. He said he embraces the challenges of the IB curriculum. \n\"You learn so many different things from an international perspective,\" Taylor said. \nTaylor said he spends some of his time \"researching colleges\" as he prepares to make a decision on his future. Although he's intrigued by offers from major programs such as Rutgers and Temple, Taylor knows that Harvard representing an interesting opportunity. \n\"I visited [Harvard] in the summer and they were so warm and welcoming,\" Taylor said. \"I know that going there would go a long way for my future after football. \n\"To graduate from Harvard, that would mean a lot for my career.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:26:18.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
