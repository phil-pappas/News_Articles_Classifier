He won his first start 5-2 over Bemidji State last weekend \n\"I'm so proud of him,\" UND coach Brad Berry said. \"Today in the morning skate he had a confidence. We want to see him keep that going. To get a shutout is a great accolade for him.\" \nJohnny Simonson's second-period goal was the only one Hrynkiw needed. Simonson jumped on a rebound and stuck it past Vermont goalie Mike Santaguida at 12:25 of the second period. \nSantaguida, who made 39 saves in all, had 33 in the first two periods to keep it a 1-0 game. \n\"We brought up after the second period that there's a common theme going on with playing simple and scoring,\" Berry said. \"You play simple you get a goal.\" \nNorth Dakota got an insurance goal on a power play early in the third period. Bryn Chyzyk took a feed from Nick Schmaltz and beat Santaguida at 5:25 of the third. \nBerry credited Schmaltz with making the play. \"That's high end, that's elite,\" he said. \"That's the puck poise and patience guys like that have.\" \nUnbeaten North Dakota (3-0-2) is ranked No. 1 in Berry's first season as head coach. It held onto the ranking after tying 4-4 with Bemidji State - Hrynkiw came on to start the third period of that game - then beating the Beavers 5-2. \nNorth Dakota outshot Vermont 41-27. \nThe Catamounts (1-3-0) have lost three straight games. They haven't beat a No. 1-ranked team since downing Denver 6-4 on Oct. 10, 2009. \nMario Puskarich's three-game scoring streak ended. \nThe teams play the second game of the series Saturday. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:11:08.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
