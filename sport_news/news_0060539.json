CHICAGO – The joy of this Mets’ postseason run is personified in their young baseball stars, by the exuberance and enthusiasm of players like Jacob deGrom.\nThe 27-year-old Major League sophomore was supposed to be nervous as he took the mound Tuesday night in Chicago, wasn’t he? Wasn’t he meant to be battling a sleepless night and stomach-churning butterflies in advance of Game 3 of the National League Championship Series at famed Wrigley Field?\nBut there was deGrom Monday, taking fellow young teammate Steven Matz on a personal tour of the Cubs’ iconic ballpark, using part of the team’s off-day to climb the stands all the way to the top of Wrigley’s old wooden centerfield scoreboard.\nSo what if he was about to put the Mets on the brink of their first World Series appearance since 1990, to keep their dream alive of winning their first title since 1986, to push the Mets’ to a nervy, tension-filled 5-2 win over the Cubs. So what if it’s now Matz’ turn to take the ball, if these two men with less than three years combined Major League experience can deliver a stunning series sweep?\nThere was fun to be had, and they weren’t going to miss it.\n “Yeah, we got up to the scoreboard, looked around, checked out all the scenery and stuff, so it was pretty cool,” Matz said. “I just think on how old it is. I just think it’s really cool. So we just wanted to check it out and soak it in as much as we can. We had some free time.”\nOne more win tonight, and the Mets will earn a few more days of free time, not resuming play until Game 1 of the World Series next Tuesday in either Kansas City or Toronto. One more win tonight, and the Mets push the Cubs into a long off-season of disappointment, extending the longest championship drought of any major North American professional sports team to 108 years.\nOne more win tonight and the Mets underscore what has defined this postseason ride, what moments like that off-day stadium hike to the scoreboard tell us about their mindset: No matter the stakes, they refuse to forget they are playing a game. Yes, it’s their livelihood. And yes, they carry the hopes and dreams of a long-starved fan base with them. But baseball is as much their passion as it is their job, and that is the daily ethos they bring to the park.\nEven the visiting ones.\nAnd what a visiting one this is, where the Mets hadn’t won in more than two years - since May 19, 2013 - where the building itself is as much a player in the game as the nine men suited up for each team. As much as there is appreciation for all that is quaint and cuddly about the Major League’s second-oldest ballpark, there is more than nostalgia to this neighborhood building erected in 1914.\nThose ivy-covered walls that line the outfield, the lush green carpets of foliage that are perhaps the park’s most identifying characteristic? Well, they’re more than just decorative, as evidenced by the bizarre ground rule that went into effect in the sixth inning, when that same ivy swallowed Michael Conforto’s scorching hit to right field.\nWhat would have been at least a run-scoring double (and perhaps a triple) was reduced to a grounds-rule double (stranding lead runner Wilmer Flores at third base) the moment Cubs’ centerfielder Dexter Fowler threw up his hands in surrender, unable to make a play on the ball, leaving what could have been a 4-2 Mets’ lead at a single run at the time. A home crowd desperate for a slice of good news and an otherwise sad story of Mets’ dominance exploded with delight, and the wall of sound they created played to a distinctly Wrigley-fied soundtrack.\nBy pure mathematics, the crowds at Wrigley Field are no bigger or badder than the ones at Citi Field. And yet, when the 40,000-plus people push Wrigley to its capacity like they did Tuesday, when they rise and groan with the weight of every pitch, when they cram themselves between steel beams coated with decades and decades of paint, there is a decidedly different feel than what you get at today’s newly-constructed, amenity filled ballparks.\nThere are no groups of people divided into sections by price points, no disappearing swaths of fans heading for behind-the-scenes restaurants and club seats, no seat-side wait staff taking orders from those setting in the most expensive seats, no suites to beckon the fans away from folding plastic seat with their number on it – heck, no concourse wide enough to accommodate large groups even if they tried.\nAnd so these fans stay where they are, flagging down hot dog and beer vendors with regularity, remaining in this intimidating block of humanity hovering perilously close to the field of play, watching only feet from the bullpens dropped along the first and third base lines, hanging over the outfield walls that leave little or no foul territory.\nThere’s a reason the land bordered by Clark and Addison Streets on two sides and Waveland and Sheffield Avenues on the other has been dubbed the friendly confines, has spawned a neighborhood of bars and restaurants known as Wrigleyville, has accommodated willing extras by erecting rooftop bleachers atop every surrounding building. It’s part of the neighborhood, as much as any of the homes nearby or residents walking the streets.\nAnd yet the old building was no match for the Mets’ youthful exuberance, not on this night, when deGrom earned his third victory of the playoffs, when Daniel Murphy hit a home run in a fifth consecutive postseason game, when veteran David Wright tasted his own fountain of youth with three hits. That’s who these Mets are, no matter where they are playing.\nEmail: sullivan@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:32:57.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
