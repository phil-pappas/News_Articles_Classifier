He’s comfort for us and for me as a coach. Losing him will be a big deal.” \nMilanovich also announced that all-purpose H-back Alexandre Dupuis hurt his foot late in Ottawa. \n“We’re trying to find the proper orthotics,’’ said Milanovich. “We’re hopeful (Dupuis can line up on Monday in his native Montreal). He’s not talked about much, but he’s had a big impact for us.” \nDupuis is a true blocking back, but he’s got decent hands and has been used as a receiving option. \nHe can also block and is used on the Argos’ jumbo packages. \nWHITAKER PUMPED TO FACE FORMER TEAM \nThere’s no sense of sentimentality or nostalgia for Brandon Whitaker, the one-time Alouettes running back who returns to Montreal for the first time since his former club released him. \nFor Whitaker, it’s all business, maintaining a business as usual approach as Monday’s big kickoff draws closer. \n“It’s a business trip,” said Whitaker. “It’s football. It’s part of the business. You might be on one team for a long time and you end up somewhere else. \n“Of course it’s going to be fun to be playing my guys, the guys I’ve played with, but we’ve got to get a win.” \nGiven his time in Montreal, Whitaker is well aware of the Als’ defensive packages and blitzes. \n“They have a very good defence,’’ said Whitaker. “They’ve always had a very good defence. I know first hand of their blitzes and in that regard I do have a little bit of a jump. For us, we have to execute and do what we do.” \nBACK TO THE HAMMER \nThe Argos made public the worst-kept secret in football on Thursday, a move to Hamilton to play home games given the return of post-season baseball to Toronto. \nIt has been known for months that the nomadic franchise would be getting the boot from Rogers Centre, the only surprise being why nothing has been done to keep the Argos in town in some makeshift venue to provide a true homefield advantage. \nWhen David Braley gets involved, money rules the day and logic and doing what’s right for the football team goes by the wayside. \nIt’s why Tuesday’s “home’’ game was moved to Ottawa. \nIt’s why the Oct. 17 home game against Calgary will now shift to Tim Hortons Field and why the Oct. 23 game against Montreal will also be played in the Hammer. \nAll told, that’s four home games not being staged in Toronto, beginning with the season opener played in Fort McMurray, where the game drew flies. \nIt was supposed to be a time for the Argos to take aim on the playoffs, the team surviving a difficult road stretch to begin the season, but knowing the schedule was going to be home friendly with five of six, including the final four, at home. \nIf anything, players and coaches have become numb to the stupidity. \nAt least players receive a per diem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:52:33.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
