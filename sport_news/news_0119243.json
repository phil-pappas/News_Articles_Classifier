This is a huge win for us, and it is preparing us for the playoffs, preparing us to make a run.” \nIndeed, the victory was important for Becton (5-1), which not only knocked off a Falcons team with whom it is competing for a postseason berth, but allowed it to keep pace with Verona, Cresskill and New Milford — all of whom are floating around the final few playoff spots. \nBut it almost didn’t happen, as the Wildcats lost a seven-point halftime lead, surrendering three touchdowns to Saddle Brook in just over a 10-minute span in the late third and early fourth quarters. When Saddle Brook senior quarterback R.J. Lazzaro cashed in from the 2-yard line at the 10:04 mark in the final period, it looked as if momentum had swung in the Falcons’ favor. Becton’s offense got rolling on its next possession though, with Bolwell (15-of-25, 238 yards, 3 TDs, 1 rushing TD) finding junior receiver Dustin Durado for a 65-yard touchdown on the Wildcats’ first play from scrimmage. \nSaddle Brook senior running back Joe Ferri scored a 2-yard touchdown with just over six minutes left in the game, and Lazzaro — from his safety position — picked Bolwell at the goal line on Becton’s ensuing drive. But a Falcons’ fumble gave the ball back to Becton, and Bolwell hooked up with senior Gianni Failla for an 18-yard touchdown and two-point play moments later. \n“I’ve been saying all year that we are waiting for the offense to explode,” said Becton head coach Jack Maher. “Saddle Brook is tough all over the place, but we started moving the ball, and our quarterback was making good reads and putting the ball where it needed to be.” \nDown just one score, the Becton defense came up with another big stop, and Bolwell proceed to hit pay dirt on a 4-yard sneak with 1:34 on the clock. That set up the game-winning conversion, which saw Strong reverse directions on his pre-snap motion and take a short pass into the flat over the goal line. \n“In our league, the top four or five teams are around one loss away from each other, so we never take anyone for granted,” Maher said in discussing the significance of the victory. “We definitely put ourselves in a good position in the playoff race, but it’s early and we still have games we need to win.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:11:05.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
