The crowd was estimated to be around 1,000.\nThe end came for Pazos at 32 seconds of the sixth round. Sosa, who hurt him in the previous round as his right hand started to find home, crumple Pazos in heap with a barrage of punches. Pazos rose to one knee but stayed down as referee Hurley McCall counted him out.\nThe win improves Sosa's record to (18-1-3, 14 KOs). Sosa has now gone 16 straight fights without a loss and hasn't been defeated in the last five years. However, he admitted that he tried to go for the knockout too on Friday rather than be patient.\n\"I fell in love with my power,\" said Sosa, adding that he felt he had Pazos (14-9-1, 8 KO) in trouble in the first round. \"I had to come back and settle down. I was rushing things because I knew he was hurt.\"\nSosa's trainer, Raul \"Chino\" Rivas, pointed out to Sosa at the end of the first round that he wanted him to slow it down.\n\"That's what he told me,\" Sosa said. \"I have to learn to be patient. I think I did a good job of it the rest of the way.\"\nSosa dominated the clearly overmatched Pazos, who has now lost six straight fights and seven of his last eight.\nAt 27, Sosa, from Camden, is on the upswing. He came into Friday night's fight riding the momentum of a first-round knockout this summer over Jerry Belmontes in August. He doesn't know when he will fight again, but he said he want to remain active and continue to improve.\n\"I'm going to get back in the gym and stay at it,\" Sosa said. \"I can get better.\"\nUndercard: Super Bantamweight Edgar Cortes (2-1, 1 K0) won a unanimous decision over Antonio Conigliaro (1-2). Lightweight Avery Sparrow saw his record fall to 4-1, 2 KOs after being disqualified for hitting low against Jerome Rodriguez (7-3-3, 2 KOs). Ismael Garcia remained undefeated (9-0-1, 4 KO) with unanimous decision over middleweight Fred Jenkins, Jr. (9-3, 3 KO). In a rematch of a fight that ended in a draw, junior welterweight David Gonzales (6-0-2, 1 KO) earned a unanimous decision over Ryan Belasco (18-5-4, 9 KO), and lightweight Tyrell Samuel (16-6-1, 6 KO) scored a knockout at 1:29 of the fourth over Victor Vasquez (19-10-1, 9 KOs).\njmitchell@philly.com\n@JmitchInquirer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:09:03.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
