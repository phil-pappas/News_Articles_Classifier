(AP) - One of upstate New York's signature auto racing events is getting a new home.\nSuper DIRT Week will move next year to the planned Central New York Raceway Park north of Syracuse.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo says the state will invest $5 million to help develop the racetrack in addition to $2.75 million previously committed. Cuomo says the state also will pay for some marketing and promotion of the new facility.\nThe New York State Fairgrounds has hosted the five-day DIRT racing event for decades. But the state fair grandstand and racetrack will be demolished this year as part of a massive makeover of the fairgrounds.\nThe new raceway park is being built in Oswego County by Glenn Donnelly, who started Super DIRT Week more than three decades ago.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
