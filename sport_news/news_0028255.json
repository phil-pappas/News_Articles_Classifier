When the time came for Volquez to execute in Game 1 of the ALCS, he flipped the original plan on its head at the suggestion of catcher Salvador Perez . \n\"We come from the bullpen, and I talk to Salvy about how we're going to pitch these guys,\" Volquez said. And we changed the whole plan, the game plan. It was like, okay -- we know they've got a lot of power hitters over there. And he told me, like, 'How do you feel pitching down and away?' \n\"And I said, 'I feel sexy tonight.' \" \nAroused with confidence and extra energy, he said, from the crowd at Kauffman Stadium chanting his name, Volquez reversed his personal postseason fortunes, seducing and dominating the highest-scoring team in Major League Baseball over six innings in a 5-0 Royals victory. \nVolquez struck out five and walked four, needing 111 pitches, but he allowed just two hits -- a pair of singles -- in what easily was the most success he's ever had in a playoff game. Volquez came in with an 8.76 ERA in three postseason starts, worse than all but eight others out of 366 in history who've made at least that many starts in the playoffs. \n\"I was able to command my fastball down and away,\" Volquez said. \nVolquez's velocity, which averages about 95 mph on his fastball, had 2-3 mph extra on it at some moments. \n\"Edd-ie, Edd-ie,\" chanted the Kauffman crowd. \n\"Hearing that from the fans, it gives you a lot of energy,\" Volquez said. Alcides Escobar had two hits to help move Kansas City's offense, which had five different players drive in a run, including Perez, who hit a solo home run. \nThe best chance Toronto had to score came in the sixth, Volquez's last, when he threw 37 pitches and walked Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista to lead off the inning. With his pitch count rising, Volquez quieted the threat, as Edwin Encarnacion struck out looking, Chris Colabello lined out to left field and Troy Tulowitzki struck out looking to end Toronto's best scoring opportunity to that point. \nRoyals manager Ned Yost said Volquez had to dig deep there. \n\"He did,\" Yost said. \"He had to, and it is challenging to get through the lineup for the third time.\" \nToronto's reward for getting Volquez out of the game? Kansas City's bullpen, which had the second-lowest ERA in the league during the regular season. The Jays did bring the tying run to the plate with one out in the eighth against Ryan Madson , but stranded two runners, plus another in the ninth. The Jays left nine on base for the game. \nThe first six innings belonged to Volquez, who posted a 3.55 ERA in 33 regular-season starts, the third-best season of his career. At 32 years old, he seems to be aging well, and even in the playoffs, where his results started out poorly with the Reds in 2010, and a year ago with the Pirates. Volquez's previous start, in the ALDS against the Rangers , had been his best: Three earned runs and eight strikeouts over 5 2/3 innings in a Game 3 loss. \nThis time was sexier. \n\"He had some good stuff for us, but he also made some mistakes inside to me,\" Donaldson said. \"I just managed to foul them off.\" \nSaid Tulowitzki: \"We had a lot of 3-2 counts, and he made pitches when he had to.\" \nEspecially in the sixth. \n\"It was long inning,\" Volquez said. \"But I was happy to stay under control and make a lot of good pitches to get out of that inning. And the key for that inning, I think, is don't panic. Stay under control and make a lot of good pitches. I've been in that situation before, so I don't have to -- I know how I've got to get out of that inning.\" \nNo, YOU the man, Edinson Volquez.
