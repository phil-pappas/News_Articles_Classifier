I know the Tiger faithful want to see LSU keep its unbeaten season alive, and I know every LSU fan wants to see Leonard Fournette rush for 200 yards again this weekend. \nThose wishes are valid. \nBut if there is ever a time to show a Southeastern Conference foe some love, this is it. \nIn the official release announcing the game had be moved to Baton Rouge, South Carolina President Harris Pastides put things in perspective. \n“In the spirit of supporting our South Carolina community that is so supportive of Gamecock Nation, we have decided to move the game to Baton Rouge,” Pastides said. “The stress on law enforcement and first responders is too great. Moreover, we’ve had many in the Carolina family directly impacted by the flooding.” \nRemember that this is South Carolina’s home game. The reason this game is in Death Valley is because law enforcement and first responders are stretched thin, and a community is hurting. \nIt’s important we don’t forget those facts, and in response, make the Gamecocks feel at home. \nLSU is doing its part to make South Carolina feel welcome. \nLSU Director of Athletics Joe Alleva confirmed The Golden Band from Tigerland is learning South Carolina’s fight song and alma mater, and LSU will play South Carolina’s hype song, “Sandstorm” by Darude. \nIn addition, LSU President F. King Alexander said in a broadcast email that LSU will host a tailgate for Tiger and Gamecock fans to enojoy free food and non-alcholic beverages on the LSU Parade Ground from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m on Saturday. I encourage you to stop by — I know I will. \nIt might not seem like much, but the little things add up. Tiger Stadium might be a more imposing environment than the Gamecocks are accustomed to for a home game, but a small sense of normalcy will be nice. \nWhen it comes to LSU fans, I don’t expect to see anyone clad in garnet and black, although that would be absolutely awesome. If there’s a way to make that happen, I’m on board. \nI’m not asking LSU fans to cheer if the Gamecocks score. But when the designated home team enters Tiger Stadium wearing unfamiliar colors, rise to your feet and cheer. Make Death Valley feel like Williams-Brice Stadium for a few seconds. \nIf that’s too much to ask, please don’t boo. \nBefore the game, welcome South Carolina fans into your tailgate with open arms. Give them food and offer a helping hand if you can. Oh, and maybe pass on “Tiger Baiting” them for just this once. \nAlso, when you walk through the gates on Saturday, consider making a donation to the American Red Cross for relief efforts in South Carolina. A few dollars from thousands of people can go a long way, and there are a lot of people in South Carolina who could use it. \nRemember, actions speak louder than words, so prove LSU’s fanbase is the best in the country this weekend. \nJack Woods is a 22-year-old mass communication senior from Ruston, Louisiana.
