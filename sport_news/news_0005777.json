More often than not, three meals were shared together. And the intense training and patriotic-filled competition stretched over two months.\nYes, Pau Gasol and Nikola Mirotic grew closer this summer, the two-top scorers on the Spanish national team that won gold at the EuroBasket tournament.\nIt's a bond new Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg witnessed first-hand when he traveled to Spain to become acquainted with the big men. It's also a pairing Hoiberg looks increasingly poised to place in the Bulls' starting lineup.\n\"We went through ups and downs. We won a championship that was very difficult to win, so obviously that brings people together,\" Gasol said. \"Comfort level? I would say big.\"\nAdded Mirotic, who played with the Spanish national team for the first time after two stints with the junior national team: \"Playing with Pau was huge for me to keep learning and improving.\"\nHoiberg's offense places a premium on shooting. At 37.8 percent from beyond the arc this preseason, Mirotic still isn't connecting at a clip fitting for a player sold as a stretch-four power forward. But Mirotic has looked more decisive and aggressive as the preseason has progressed.\n\"He's a player who spreads the floor, knows how to play the game, is a threat from outside,\" Gasol said. \"It allows me to have room to operate from the post and we understand each other well. We have good chemistry and connection and play well off each other.\"\nHoiberg said that extends to their shared Spanish language that Mirotic, a native of Montenegro, speaks fluently. More often than not, Gasol communicates to Mirotic in Spanish.\nHoiberg noted Mirotic's recent decisiveness as well. That included four 3-pointers in Tuesday's victory over the Pacers.\n\"I loved it. He was firing it up. He had a really good rhythm,\" Hoiberg said. \"You could see it in his shot. He had great balance. His legs were good. I was really happy with the way he played.\"\nThis is a huge opportunity for Mirotic, who led the entire NBA in fourth-quarter scoring last March but endured too many bouts with inconsistency during his rookie season. He's confident his second season will be smoother.\n\"I know how to play now. I know the players,\" Mirotic said. \"And I like the new system. Playing fast, running the floor, trying to score easy baskets. I think we need that. We need to play with space. I don't think it's just me. I think everyone likes it.\"\nMirotic downplayed his likely starting role.\n\"I don't care about this really. My only worry is how I can put the energy into my team,\" he said. \"I just have to play a simple game and be good defensively. Whether I start or not is not my preoccupation. The coach has to think about that. But I'm really feeling great right now and I just want to enjoy this season.\"\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Nikola Mirotic Fred Hoiberg Pau Gasol Chicago Bulls NBA", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627f94f/turbine/ct-bulls-gasol-mirotic-spt-1022-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:22:53.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
