Clay tried to ensure that his players wouldn’t look ahead to next week’s big rivalry game at Trinity Christian, which could also have bigger connotations that include home field for the first round of the GISA Class AAA state playoffs as well as a possible share of this year’s region title. \nHe did it by making the only word beginning with ‘T’ that was discussed this week began with either ‘wing’ or ended with ‘ouchdown.’ \n“I told the kids I didn’t want to hear the word ‘Trinity’ come out of their mouths,” Clay said heading into tonight’s trip to Dominion Christian. “Most teams that look ahead wind up losing ahead. I wanted to make sure they kept their focus on just Dominion.” \nIt should be. Despite struggling with numbers and carrying a roster under 20 players, the Knights still maintain the same potential to put up big points like they have in recent years under longtime head coach Javier Jenkins. \nThree annual meetings between the schools have been shootouts, with the home team winning each time. \n“Javier Jenkins does a fantastic job with that program. They’ve lost half their team with transfers going out, but with the guys they have, they still put a good 11 [players] out on the field,” Clay said of Dominion. “They’re going to still try and spread us out. They pass the ball about 90-percent of the time.” \nNewcomer Brandon Mummy led three scoring drives recently against Trinity Christian’s first-team defense in what turned into a 64-38 shootout on the Lions homecoming night. \nThe Knights have shown four and five receiver sets on nearly every play. \nOn top of a defensive challenge, Marietta has never been kind to Heritage, which nearly rallied back from a 19-point halftime deficit two years ago only to fall short in a 33-26 loss. The game featured a blocked extra point by then-sophomore Cole Jones, this year’s leading tackler for the Hawks. Jones will remain on the sidelines, however, while recovering from a separated shoulder. \nHeritage, though, welcomed back offensive lineman Cody Chastain last week on homecoming night while defeating Holy Spirit 30-17 after teams went to halftime tied at 10. The Hawks’ defense gave up an 82-yard touchdown run to open the game, but clamped down from there. \nClay, meanwhile, understands how important ball control and time-of-possession could be tonight, both in keeping Dominion’s offense off the field and with equal hopes of tiring the Knights. \n“We have to try and stretch the field with guys like Matt Burns and Peyton Henson and then pound it up the middle with our quarterback [Jacob Bryant] and Hamp Smith,” Clay said. “They’ve had some games where you could see them getting tired.” \nSmith enters tonight with a team-high 657 yards rushing and 11 touchdowns. Bryant has combined for over 1,000 total yards on 246 rushing with four scores and 751 passing.
