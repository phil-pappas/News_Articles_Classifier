Back and forth Irving went for 10 hours.\nThat night, Irving told himself heâd never settle for such a job, vowing to do whatever it took to get back into football.\nToday, 10 months since that night in a warehouse, Irving is a member of the Dallas Cowboys, and one step from realizing the goal he envisioned for himself â\" becoming a starting defensive lineman in the National Football League.\nâHonestly, our (football) practices were hard but that one shift at Home Depot was probably the hardest thing Iâve ever done,â said Irving, who promptly got sick from the constant in and out, from hot to cold, then quit after two days in bed. âIt opened my eyes and showed me I have opportunities that not everyone else has.â\nThat night motivated Irving to call on an old friend and mentor to help him change the unfortunate, self-inflected circumstance of his life and lead him toward an opportunity to play in the National Football League.\nIrving was determined to right the wrongs of his last year at Iowa State, where he was briefly suspended for a domestic disturbance, then was thrown out of school for a public disturbance in which he was involved.\nBut, the two incidents were too much for Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads to ignore. Irving was dismissed from Iowa State in April 2014.\nThat same day, Irving made the nearly 1,800-mile drive back to San Jacinto to live with his girlfriend, Angela Sanchez, and their daughter, Zoe, at Sanchezâs parentsâ house.\nAwaiting him at San Jacinto High School was longtime coach Bill Powell, who coached Irving during his time in the Tigersâ program.\nLuckily for Irving, Powell, who helped him get a scholarship to Iowa State through personal contacts, was still in Irvingâs corner, ready to help him get back on track with his life and football career.\nâHe accepted accountability for his mistakes,â said Powell, who remained in close contact with Irving during his time in Ames. âI think that was the reality check he might have needed to kind of get him a little more focused on what he needed to do.â\nMISSTEPS IN AMES\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:35:20.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
