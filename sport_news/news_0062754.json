The Crusaders haven't won a regional since 2005, but with six seniors, Carlson hopes to see the Crusaders make school history. A key, three-set win against Rock Falls on Thursday earned Lutheran the conference championship, but now the team is looking forward. \"Winning conference was a goal, but not an overriding goal,\" Carlson said. \"It's great, but that's not all they want to do.\" New this year, the Illinois High School Athletic Association divided the Class 1A, 2A and 3A sectionals into sub-sectionals, changing the look of this year's regional matchups. The move is an effort to evenly spread team with more competitive records throughout the sectional, theoretically preventing a No. 1 and No. 2 sectional seed from meeting before the sectional finals. Lutheran is seeded No. 1 in the Fulton sub-sectional B, ahead of Keith Country Day (No. 2) and conference opponents Oregon (No. 3) and Byron (No. 4). Other Big Northern Conference teams like Winnebago (No. 9) and Rockford Christian (No. 11) are also in the sectional. On the other side of the Fulton sectional, strong NUIC contenders Lena-Winslow and Dakota take the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds, respectively. Lutheran opens the playoffs on Tuesday, facing the winner of Monday's semifinal between Aurora Christian and host-school Somonauk. Neither team is familiar, but at this point in the season, Carlson puts little emphasis on record or seeding. \"It doesn't mean anything at this point in the year,\" she added. \"Every match is going to be tough. You're going to get every team's best effort.\" Also in the Somonauk Regional, Byron plays Elgin St. Edward on Tuesday, while Oregon and Winnebago join Keith, Pecatonica, South Beloit and Rockford Christian in a regional full of familiar faces. Big Northern teams Stillman Valley, Dixon, Rock Falls, Mendota, Harvard and Marengo will battle to advance against NIC-10 teams Boylan, Belvidere and Freeport in the Sycamore Sectional. Class 4A Unlike the other three classes, the state's 4A schools did not divide into sub-sectionals. NIC-10 Conference champion Hononegah is the highest-rank local team (No. 7) in the 21-team Hampshire sectional, facing a familiar opponent in the first round: No. 10 Belvidere North. Jefferson (No. 19) and Guilford (No. 11) head to the DeKalb Regional, while East (No. 12) and Auburn (No. 20) will play in Dundee-Crown. However, Harlem (No. 16) may have the toughest playoff road: Should the Huskies win Monday's quarterfinal against Elgin, they will face No. 1 seed Cary-Grove in Tuesday's regional semifinal. No. 8 Huntley and No. 9 Algonguin Jacobs make up the other half of the regional.
