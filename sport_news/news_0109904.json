Chestnut St. after a 911 call reported possible gunfire, which sparked a campus-wide lockdown.\nNo gunman was found after nearly an hour of searching, but fears of a shooter at the school prompted eight law enforcement agencies to race to the scene. The local response came on the heels of two fatal campus shootings earlier Friday in Texas and Arizona.\nSo when the anonymous call came in around 3:30 p.m., police responded quickly.\nDespite a recent string of unfounded threats against Louisville and Southern Indiana schools, police did not treat the incident lightly.\n\"We take every type of situation as seriously as we can,\" said Dwight Mitchell, spokesman for the Louisville Metro Police Department. \"Our ultimate goal is to provide safety. Obviously, yes, we do use a lot of resources, but we’d rather error on the side of caution rather than be caught being unprepared.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nArne Duncan to visit 2 JCPS schools, JCTC\nA search of JCTC's Building A revealed nothing to support a report of what the school called a \"violent incident,\" Mitchell said.\nJCTC students received an electronic alert at 3:39 p.m. telling them to use caution, evacuate safely and seek cover in locked rooms if possible. Minutes later, JCTC sent out an email alert telling students there was a report of an \"active shooter\" on the campus and police were responding.\nPolice spoke with the caller to determine if it was a hoax. Mitchell said no charges are expected to be filed at this time.\n“If you see something, say something, and that’s what it seemed happened here today,” Mitchell said.\nThe building was secured around 4:15 p.m., and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System declared the \"campus emergency\" over at 4:23 p.m. on its Twitter account.\n\"I know that the nation has experienced this across our country, and we're glad to report here in Louisville that this did not turn into anything tragic,\" Mitchell said.\nThere have been several deadly shootings on campuses recently, including two Friday. A Northern Arizona University student was killed and three more were wounded Friday morning. Hours later, in Houston, one student was killed and another person was wounded in an apartment parking lot on the edge of Texas Southern University campus.\nOn Oct. 1, a gunman at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., killed nine people and wounded nine others before killing himself.\nSince mid-September, at least six alleged threats in the Louisville area prompted heightened security or lockdowns at schools and at least one downtown Louisville office tower.\nOn Sept. 14, New Albany-Floyd County Consolidated School Corp. increased police presence at its schools following a Facebook threat. Police determined that threat was posted on a hacked account of a former student.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nAnti-violence leader steps down, takes DC job\nOn Sept. 18, Western High School in Louisville was locked down for more than an hour and a half after police received a call about a possible live shooter. Twelve days later, both Western and Valley high schools went on heightened alert after a caller dialed 911 to report threats to those buildings. Police determined both were hoaxes.\nA Western High student has since been arrested for placing the hoax calls.\nOn Sept. 25, JCPS’ Stuart Middle went on heightened alert following a social media threat to the building, according to JCPS. Police later said the threat was made against a person who might have attended the school. That same day, the PNC Tower and other downtown locations were the subject of threats, though several searches came up with nothing.\nFour days later, Greater Clark County Schools posted a Facebook update late in the evening saying that a social media threat made against Jeffersonville High was not credible.\nReporter Allison Ross contributed to this report. Reporter Matthew Glowicki can be reached at (502) 582-4989.\nSays he heard a commotion in the hallway, and police ordered everyone to evacuate.
