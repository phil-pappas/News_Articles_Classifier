Nobody will say it,\" Cherry said before specifically pointing out the fact that Roger Centre's retractable roof remained closed for Game 1 despite fair Toronto weather and making note of home plate umpire Vic Carapazza's controversial strike zone during Game 2.\nCherry also had an issue with a replay review that was upheld in the 14th inning of Game that eventually led to Texas' winning run in a 6-4 Blue Jays loss.\nReplays showed that Toronto shortstop Troy Tulowitzki had applied a tag to Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor as Odor slid back in to second base. But Odor's foot appeared to bounce off the bag as Tulowitzki tried to get his glove down. Whether or not Odor got his foot back on the bag fast enough or if Tulowitzki tagged him in time was debatable.\nCherry didn't think so, however.\n\"The guy off second base, he's off that far,\" Cherry said, motioning a couple inches with his fingers. \"They go and look at it and they say it's all right.\n\"We're getting stiffed. You know why we're getting stiffed? Because they do not want a Canadian team in the final. That's my opinion.\"\nThe Blue Jays, in the post-season for the first time since 1993 when they beat the Philadelphia Phillies to complete back-to-back World Series championships, are facing elimination in the ALDS with Game 3 to be played in Texas on Sunday night.\nCherry doesn't think a comeback is likely.\n\"They'll win one or two games. I can't see them winning three,\" he said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:09:26.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
