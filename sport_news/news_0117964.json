FOXBORO, Mass. — For three quarters, the Jets held Tom Brady in check, albeit with help from his often-butterfingered receivers.\nBut in the fourth quarter, Brady broke their hearts, much like he has done many times.\nBrady led two touchdown drives in the fourth period to erase a four-point lead and New England held on for a 30-23 victory. Including post-season, Brady is 22-6 against the Jets as a starting quarterback.\nNick Folk kicked a 55-yard field goal with 18 seconds left to cut the Jets’ deficit to seven. Brandon Marshall recovered the onsides kick to give the Jets one final chance, but two plays later, he was called for a false start with one second left, resulting in a 10-second runoff. That ended the game.\nAfter Folk’s 30-yard field goal had given the Jets a 20-16 lead, New England marched 80 yards in 10 plays, scoring on Brady’s 8-yard third-down pass to Danny Amendola. He took a hard hit at the goal line but held on for the catch.\nThe Jets managed one first down on their next possession, then punted. This time, Brady and the Pats took 10 plays to go 68 yards. Brady caught the Jets in a full blitz and threw 15 yards to tight end Rob Gronkowski for the touchdown, giving the Pats a 30-20 lead with 1:13 to go.\nThe Jets’ offense started terribly. After running back Chris Ivory was nailed for a 4-yard loss, Ryan Fitzpatrick was sacked by Chandler Jones and fumbled. Dont’a Hightower recovered and the Patriots had the ball at the Jets’ 19-yard-line. But the defense held, with Muhammad Wilkerson sacking Tom Brady on third down. Steve Gostkowski then connected on a 38-yard field goal to give New England a 3-0 lead.\nThe Jets answered with a 20-yard field goal by Folk, capping a 15-play, 78-yard drive. However, safety Patrick Chung dislodged a potential scoring pass from the hands of tight end Jeff Cumberland in the end zone on third-and-goal from the 2, forcing Folk’s kick. Cumberland had a 16-yard catch on the first play of the drive.\nOn their third possession, the Jets had a play, 83-yard scoring drive, and this one resulted in a touchdown. Fitzpatrick hit seldom-used wide receiver Jeremy Kerley, who beat rookie cornerback Justin Coleman on the play, for a 5-yard score and a 10-3 lead with 12:30 left in the first half. The Jets converted three third downs on the drive.\nNew England tied the score at 10 on Brady’s 1-year sneak on fourth and goal with 6:24 left in the second quarter. A 31-yard punt by Steve Weatherford gave the Patriots great field position at the Jets’ 47 and it took New England 11 plays to cash in. Weatherford, who punted for the Jets from 2009-10, was re-signed by the team Saturday because regular punter Ryan Quigley was unable to play because of a leg injury.\nNew England went ahead 13-10 on Gostkowski’s 46-yard field goal with two minutes left in the half. On the previous play, the Patriots faced a third-and-1 at the 20, but an unblocked Calvin Pace sacked Brady for an 8-yard loss, making the Pats settle for three points.\nNew England also was held to a field goal after driving 65 yards with the second-half kickoff. The Patriots had first-and-goal at the 6 but three straight Brady passes went incomplete, including a drop of a sure touchdown pass by Julian Edelman on third down.\nThe Jets took advantage with an 80-yard drive on 13 plays. Fitzpatrick capped it with a 9-yard pass to Ivory in the left flat, putting the Jets ahead 17-16. The Jets later went ahead 20-16 on Folk’s 30-yard field goal 2:10 into the fourth quarter, one play after Marshall dropped a potential touchdown pass. It would have been a difficult catch, but it was the kind the superstar wideout often makes.\nE-mail: pelzman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:44:05.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
