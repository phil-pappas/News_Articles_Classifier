The weekend games begin at 7:30 p.m. \n\"I sure think that our team is ready to get busier,\" McCrimmon said. \"The midweek game this week is, I think, going to be real good for us and then of course Friday and Saturday on the weekend so it will be the first week that we haven’t had Monday to Friday with practice.\" \nThe Wheat Kings, who went 0-for-20 on the power play to start the Western Hockey League season, exploded for four goals with the man advantage on Saturday and one more that came two seconds after a power play ended. \nHawryluk opened the scoring after an early Brandon power play had ended when he knocked in a rebound. Before the period ended, he had banged in two more rebounds on the power play for the natural hat trick. \nJohn Quenneville wired a shot in early in the second on another power play and Hawryluk added his fourth goal of the game, again with the man advantage, just over a minute later. \nReid Duke made it 6-0 late in the second with a nice shot from the slot that he created off the rush. \nJordan Papirny, making his fourth straight start of the young season, stopped 16 shots for his seventh career shutout. He had five last season. \nQuenneville ended up with a goal and two assists and Nolan Patrick had three assists. \n\"I think we passed up some shots through three games so we did put more pucks on goal tonight,\" McCrimmon said. \"I’m pleased with how little we gave up as well with only 16 shots against. That certainly goes a long way towards helping you be successful on the road.\" \nICINGS: Wheat King F Rihards Bukarts has been suspended by the WHL for a dangerous hit from behind on Friday against the Calgary Hitmen that earned him a major and game misconduct. The length of the suspension hasn’t been determined … Brandon’s scratches were Bukarts, F Tim McGauley, F/D Quintin Lisoway, F Garrett Armour and D Dominic Thom as Brandon dressed just two overagers … Quenneville, Patrick and Tyler Coulter skated on a line together on Saturday … Former Wheat King F Taylor Cooper was among the scratches for the Pats. He continues to recover from off-season shoulder surgery. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:40:34.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
