Bottom line tonight here was we had 90 percent of our lineup playing their first pro game and that's not an excuse. They did too.\" \nKnoxville plays an exhibition game Sunday at 3:30 p.m. against Mississippi in Southaven, Miss. The Ice Bears were scheduled to leave at 7 a.m. Sunday. \n\"We'll jump on the bus and see what they do on the road (Sunday) on the bigger ice,\" Craigen said. \nSaturday's game started 50 minutes late because Fayetteville's bus broke down outside of Asheville, N.C., and Knoxville's bus was sent to pick up the FireAntz. \nIce Bears captain Jason Price and goalie Bryan Hince were on the bench coaching the team, with Craigen and assistant coach Jamie Ronayne viewing from the stands. \nKnoxville started five rookies along with second-year goalie Braely Torris, who played for the Ice Bears last season and spent time with Greenville (S.C.) of the East Coast Hockey League. \nRookie Jackson Brewer of Trinity College gave Knoxville a 1-0 lead at 1 minute, 31 seconds of the first period with a goal from the right wing past Parker Van Buskirk. \nJake Baird tied it 1-1 with a power-play goal with 5:21 left in the period. \nThe Ice Bears went ahead 2-1 at 5:11 of the second on a goal by rookie Doug Reid of Alabama-Huntsville. \nJosh McQuade's goal at 6:49 tied it 2-2. \nKnoxville changed goalies with 7:37 left in the second as Torris went to the bench and was replaced by Garrett Sheehan, a rookie out of University of Toronto. \nFayetteville scored three times in the last 6:07 of the second as McQuade, Jason Trott, and Brendan Bulka posted goals for a 5-2 lead. \n\"The first three shots (Sheehan) got were a two-on-one, a backdoor tap-in and a give-away by the d-zone, so I don't think you can put much of that on the goaltender,\" Craigen said. \"I thought he played fine.\" \nThe Ice Bears won a post-game exhibition shootout 1-0 with Sheehan in goal. Trever Hertz scored the only goal of the shootout. \n\"We got a good evaluation and got the kinks out,\" Craigen said. \"I just think it's an opportunity for some of these young guys to get some prime minutes on a pretty good hockey team in a pretty good situation here in Knoxville.\" Dave Link is a freelance contributor.
