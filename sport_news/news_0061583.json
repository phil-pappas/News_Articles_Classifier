The Australians crossed for tries in the second, 10th, and 32nd minutes until the game plans and momentum changed.\n\"I've been brought up with tries — that's it. Attacking footy,\" Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said. \"It can leave you open on the counter-punch sometimes ... (but) I think that's how Australians want us to play.\"\nCheika took over a Wallabies team in disarray a year ago, and immediately lost three of the four tests on a European tour. Since then, they've only lost one test — to New Zealand. But that was a week after clinching the Rugby Championship title with a win over the All Blacks in Sydney.\n\"The guys are playing for each other. They want to play for Australia, they're committed,\" Cheika said. \"It hasn't always been perfect, but in rugby that's the basis.\"\nThe Pumas tried early to play with the same endeavour and panache that earned them a 43-20 win over Six Nations champion Ireland in the quarterfinals last week, but it backfired to start with.\nLock Rob Simmons intercepted a Sanchez inside ball and sprinted 30 metres to score near the posts after 68 seconds, the fastest try of the tournament. The Pumas persisted with the attacking strategy, but simple turnovers cost them repeatedly as David Pocock and Michael Hooper poached turnover ball.\nStung after last week's last-minute 35-34 win over Scotland, the Wallabies were more controlled but still expansive in attack when they could be, leading to 113-test winger Ashley-Cooper's diving tries into the left corner in the 10th minute and the right in the 32nd — both from sprinting onto long, floating cut-out passes from flyhalf Bernard Foley and centre Matt Giteau.\nYet the Australians led only 19-9 at halftime, still under pressure at the scrum, as expected, and from Sanchez. The Argentines narrowly missed a try that could have swung momentum in first-half injury time, when Sanchez made a line break and unloaded to Hernandez. But the back-of-the-hand flick pass from Hernandez went to ground in the right corner.\nThe Pumas twice reduced the margin to seven points as the kickers traded goals, making it 22-15 with eight minutes remaining when Ashley-Cooper crossed for his third, and moved to joint fifth on the all-time World Cup list with 11.\nArgentina had some serious setbacks in the first half. Flying winger Juan Imhoff staggered off the field after a head knock, lock Tomas Lavanini was sin-binned for a no-arms shoulder charge on Israel Folau, and skipper Agustin Creevy succumbing to the leg injury that threatened to keep him out of the semifinal.\nThe Pumas reverted to the tighter play they're famous for, with judicious kicking, and banking points from the powerful scrum earning penalties.\nStill, even with Diego Maradona in the 80,025-strong crowd, which heavily backed the Pumas with football-style chants of \"Ole, ole, ole, ole, Pu-mas, Pu-mas,\" Argentina was unable to break through to reach its first Rugby World Cup final. The Pumas will play South Africa in the third-place match, with a chance to equal their finish in the 2007.\nArgentina coach Daniel Hourcade, who was in tears after the match, said the Pumas had no regrets after doing their country proud.\n\"If we played again, we'd follow the same plan,\" Hourcade said. \"I hope the legacy we leave is the way we played the game.\"\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:22:30.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
