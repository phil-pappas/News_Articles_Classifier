(Photo: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY Sports)\nStory Highlights Game 2: Fever at Lynx, 8 p.m. Tuesday, ESPN2 482 CONNECT 16 TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE MINNEAPOLIS – While others in the Target Center were losing their heads, Briann January kept hers.\nThe 11,023 fans, most waving towels, grew loudest in the third quarter when the Minnesota Lynx trimmed a seven-point deficit to four. January responded with one jump shot, then another, to extend the Indiana Fever’s lead to eight as the arena grew silent.\nIn the fourth quarter, as the clock neared the two-minute mark, January split the defense for a lay-in. Soon thereafter, she added yet another jumper to push the Fever ahead by five.\nThe Fever secured a 75-69 victory Sunday, giving them a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five WNBA Finals. It was a showcase for January, a perennial all-defensive team selection who scored a season-high 19 points.\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nHow the Fever were built, player by player\n“She’s the key to that team,” Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said. “I know everybody is talking about (Tamika) Catchings, and that’s true. But when you have a point guard that’s getting things done at that level – she scored 19 and had us twisted – that says a lot about her.”\nThe Lynx are 18-2 under Reeves in the playoffs, and both losses were to the Fever in Game 1s of WNBA Finals. The Lynx will try to even the series Tuesday (ESPN2, 8 p.m.).\nGame 3 will be Friday and Game 4 (if necessary) next Sunday, both at Indianapolis.\nJanuary started 0-of-5 from the field but finished 6-of-14. She was 6-of-6 on free throws and added four rebounds and six assists.\nOne moment in which she lost her cool was when she fouled out with 1:12 left. She was restrained by teammates but assessed a technical. January said Maya Moore “jumped out of bounds” like pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, inducing the call from official Sue Blauch. January pointed to a bleeding cut on her face that she said came from the collision.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Gallery | Fever vs. Lynx, Game 1 of WNBA Finals Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Shavonte Zellous drove to the rim for a layup to make it 72-67 with 53 seconds left, and Catchings scored the final three points on free throws.\nCatchings said she challenged January to lead the Fever on both ends of the floor.\n“When she plays the way that she knows how to defensively, she gets under people’s skin so bad,” Catchings said. “It’s fun to watch as a teammate. Even offensively, down the stretch, it’s the best I have seen her play, to be able to finish out games, I think, ever.\n“The confidence she played with tonight, we need her to play with that for the rest of the series.”\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\n5 things to watch in WNBA Finals\nMoore scored 27 points and 6-6 center Sylvia Fowles 21, but no other Lynx player had more than nine. January’s primary defensive assignment was Seimone Augustus, one of Minnesota’s five Olympic gold medalists. Augustus shot 3-of-11 for nine points in 35 minutes.\nReeve was vexed afterward because the Lynx led the Fever in shooting percentage (42 to 36 percent), rebounds (34-32) and free throw attempts (23-16).\n“How do you lose that game?” she said, then answered her own question. “We just didn’t do the little things at key times, and they did. This is Indiana. This is what they do.”\nThe Fever were 16-of-16 on free throws and outscored the Lynx 22-12 in second-chance points.\nThe Lynx missed an opportunity to seize control early. The Fever shot 1-of-9 with three turnovers midway through the first quarter.\nThe score was tied at 10 after one quarter -- the lowest-scoring quarter in finals history -- and the Fever closed out the second quarter on a 16-5 run, forging a 35-29 lead. The Lynx led just once in the second half, 62-61, before Marissa Coleman’s 3-pointer returned the advantage to the Fever.\nColeman scored 16 points, Catchings 12, and Zellous and Shenise Johnson 10 each.\nThe collective nature of the Fever was epitomized on the final play of the half. Catchings stole the ball and passed to Coleman, who in turn passed to Johnson. Erlana Larkins scored at the buzzer off Johnson’s assist.\nThe Fever coach, Stephanie White, is new, as are most of the players. But so far, the Fever are following the same old formula from their 2012 championship: Fall behind 1-0 in each of the first two best-of-three series, then win Game 1 of the finals.\n“I think our team, we just believe in one another,” White said. “We trust one another. We understand that no matter what happens in the course of the game, if we come together, we’re going to put ourselves in position to win.”\nCall Star reporter David Woods at (317) 444-6195.
