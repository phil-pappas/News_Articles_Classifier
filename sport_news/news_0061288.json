He threw three interceptions, misfired on passes to open receivers, and the Eagles seemed to win despite the way Bradford played - not because of him.\nDon't expect a quarterback change or anything other than public support from coach Chip Kelly. Kelly disagreed with the notion that the Eagles are simply waiting for Bradford to turn the corner. He made it seem like Plan B is not even a consideration.\n\"Sam is our quarterback,\" Kelly said. \"We have full confidence in Sam.\"\nMore coverage POLL: Is Sam Bradford a Super Bowl-caliber QB?

Yes No View results The question would not have been asked after the previous two games, which were Bradford's best of the season. He had a quarterback ratings of 122.6 in Week 4 and 88.5 in Week 5. Those were his highest marks yet. In Week 6, that rating slipped to 61.3 - his worst of the season. When asked if his latest performance was a step back, Bradford did not dispute the premise.\n\"If that's the way you want to look at it, then yeah, it wasn't as good as the last two games,\" Bradford said after the game. \"There's no doubt about it. But I think everything that went wrong tonight is correctable.\"\nBradford's inconsistencies have become a pattern. He has nine interceptions this season - tied for the second-highest total in the league. He continues to underthrow his targets. There are times when Bradford looks sharp and makes Kelly's offseason gamble look prescient, but the problem with Bradford is there's too much variance on a pass-to-pass basis.\nIt brings up the question: Why is he so inconsistent?\n\"That's a great question,\" Kelly said. \"There's not one thing. I think, at times, it's the rush will break down, so now he has to move his feet. We did have some inconsistency and some wrong routes run the other night, so that kind of puts him in a situation [in which] he's expecting the receiver to be here and he's not there anymore.\n\"So we had a couple communication issues. . . . But that's not an excuse, that is just those are things we need to continue to work on as a group to get everybody on the same page.\"\nKelly said one of the reasons the Eagles liked Bradford was because he didn't have a tendency to turn the ball over, which makes this season's mistakes even more confounding.\nThe Eagles can work with Bradford on drills in practice, but Kelly conceded that anything in practice is a controlled environment. There's no live pass rush. Kelly can't simulate what Bradford sees in games.\n\"There's a reason everybody in the NFL has [quarterbacks] in red jerseys,\" Kelly said. \"We've got to do a little bit better of a job in terms of simulating the experience of what goes on in a game.\"\nThe communication issues have not been solved even with more experience by Bradford in the offense. On his second interception Monday, he threw a deep pass to Riley Cooper. But Cooper broke off the route to run a curl pattern - he had the option depending on the depth of the coverage - and the quarterback and receiver were not on the same page.\n\"Riley was a little late in his decision part of it and Sam thought he was going to run though,\" Kelly said. \"Then Riley decided to stop. You could see both sides of it.\"\nBradford admitted the first interception was just a \"terrible throw\" in which he missed an open target. He credited the defender for making a play on the ball on the third interception.\nBradford admitted he was not happy with his performance despite the result, and he knows he must improve if the Eagles will become contenders this season.\n\"It's not even a question,\" Bradford said. \"It was just inconsistent, missing throws. There was some good, there was some bad. But I know for us to be where we want to be, I have to play much better.\"\nExtra points Linebacker DeMeco Ryans left the game with a hamstring injury. He said he could have returned to action but would not have been 100 percent. When asked if he would be ready for this Sunday's game against the Carolina Panthers, Ryans said he would \"see how it goes.\" Linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) is closer to returning after missing the last two games. The Eagles return to practice on Wednesday.\nzberman@phillynews.com\n@ZBerm", "external_links": ["http://polls.clickability.com/polls", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:37:04.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
