Law 12 \nForan 52, New London 28 WILLIMANTIC — The most plays Windham ran in a series was six and the Whippets produced only 164 yards of offense against the Killingly Redmen on Friday. It was a defensive coordinator’s dream. “It was pretty close to perfect,” Killingly veteran assistant coach Gary Brine said with a smile. “The kids paid attention, they learned, they’re veterans. It makes it a little easier, but they did play great.” As a result, the Redmen pulled out their second big win in a row, a hard-earned 15-7 win over a previously undefeated Windham team. “We’re talking to the kids, telling them take it week by week, we’re afraid of a letdown. We didn’t have the best week of practice, but I think they learned from it. Nothing will be easy for us. We have to keep improving and New London (on Friday) will be a hungry team,” said Killingly head coach Chad Neal. Stopping Seiji The Redmen (4-1, 3-1 ECC Small) set out to take away Windham’s big back, Seiji Arzuaga. The Whippets knew they had to limit the yards gained by Killingly’s Austin Caffrey. Both defenses were successful in their pursuits in the first half and that meant others were going to have to step up. For the Whippets, it was Cullan Contos. Killingly did an excellent job of stuffing the middle and limited the effectiveness of Arzuaga (7 carries, 24 yards). “It’s hard to tell from the sidelines, but I don’t think we blocked very well on the interior,” Windham coach Brian Crudden said. But a more shifty runner such as Contos (13 carries, 128 yards) can create his own holes or exploit the one that may exist. That’s what happened on the final play of the first quarter as the senior swept left, saw a little opening and cut back right and scored from 48 yards out. Caffrey became the first local running back to clear 1,000 yards this season (he has 1,004 after gaining 131 yards) but in his first 10 carries, he was able to gain only 14 yards. Still, the Redmen were able to answer the Contos touchdown with one of their own on the first drive of the second quarter. After converting on a fourth-and-1 from their own 29-yard line on a quarterback sneak by Kyle Derosier and again on third-and-10 from their own 46, Killingly was able to get the ball to the Windham 29. Derosier (6-for-11 passing, 84 yards) took the snap and looked downfield where Vasileios Politis had broken free from Contos. “There was no way I was going to drop that, not in my lifetime,” Politis said. “(Derosier) was dead on and we’ve been practicing that all week.” Page 2 of 2 - The 29-yard touchdown pass gave Killingly an 8-7 lead. Standout player Politis also shined on the defensive side of the ball. He intercepted two passes from Windham quarterback Brody Labbe, who was frustrated by both pressure from the Killingly defensive line and the Politis-led secondary. Labbe completed only 2 of 10 passes for 6 yards and, in addition to the two interceptions, had three other passes broken up. “They’re playing great,” Neal said of the secondary. “We’re playing a lot of guys. We played a lot of guys this week who didn’t play defense last week because of the sub package. Last week, we saw a spread team, (Friday) we saw a wing-T team. Fortunately, we have the depth to match up with teams.” It was up to Caffrey to once again put the finishing touches on the win. After getting just 19 yards in his first 13 carries, Caffrey left the Windham sideline in awe when he broke several tackles and rumbled 39 yards for the score with 5 minutes, 20 seconds left in the third quarter. He carried the ball another 18 times for 73 more yards —15 of those carries in the final quarter when Windham (5-1, 4-1) had the ball for all of 1 minute, 13 seconds, enough to run four plays. “He only broke the one big one, but he pounds,” Crudden said. “They give him a lot of carries late in the game and making those first downs. We played tough for three downs and he’s going to get that first down on the fourth down. He’s a tough kid and brings a lot of pressure on the defense.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:16:26.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
