Then his victory celebration made some of his rivals wonder if the reigning Sprint Cup champion had something to hide. Many believe Harvick backed his car into the wall during his celebratory burnout, creating damage to his Chevrolet. Harvick on Tuesday denied any knowledge of hitting the wall, but some wondered if the action was done to limit NASCAR’s ability to inspect the car after the race. Brad Keselowski said Tuesday it was “absolutely” common for drivers to intentionally damage their cars after a race, and Denny Hamlin called on NASCAR to figure out a way to keep cars intact for the technical inspection. Cycling Notorious doping physician aims to stop a film ROME – Lance Armstrong and Tom Danielson’s former physician has reportedly filed a lawsuit aiming to halt distribution in Italy of a movie about the disgraced cyclist. The ANSA news agency reports that lawyers for Dr. Michele Ferrari have requested that the “The Program”– due to be released in Italy on Thursday – be sequestered from distributor Videa and are seeking damages. Lawyers say Ferrari never administered EPO to Armstrong. Ferrari is played by French actor Guillaume Canet in the film, which is directed by Stephen Frears. Ferrari was banned for life for helping athletes use performance enhancing drugs by both the Italian Cycling Federation and the U.S. Anti-Doping Association. Armstrong has acknowledged that Ferrari was his trainer until 2004. NBA Knicks coach has altercation with a former teammate NEW YORK – New York Knicks head coach Derek Fisher was involved in an altercation with Memphis Grizzlies forward and former teammate Matt Barnes on Saturday. The New York Post, citing an anonymous source, reported Wednesday that the altercation was because Fisher is dating Barnes’ estranged wife. Fisher filed for divorce from his wife, Candace, in March. The person says Fisher traveled to Los Angeles after practice Saturday to see his children and the altercation happened that night while Fisher was attending a gathering at the home of Gloria Govan, Barnes’ estranged wife. Fisher, speaking before the Knicks’ exhibition game, wouldn’t comment about his personal life but says he is “completely focused and committed to the team.” NHL Rangers get small revenge in the opening game CHICAGO – Oscar Lindberg, Kevin Klein and Derek Stepan scored in the first period, and the New York Rangers ruined Chicago’s Stanley Cup party with a 3-2 victory over the Blackhawks on Wednesday on the first night of the NHL season. J.T. Miller had two assists and Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves for New York. Cheered on by a sellout crowd of 22,104, with many dressed in their usual red jerseys, the Blackhawks raised the banner for the franchise’s sixth NHL title during a colorful pregame ceremony. Fluorescent balls bounced around the seats and LED wristbands for the fans provided a synchronized lightshow during player introductions and highlight presentations. All-Star winger Patrick Kane, the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York, heard loud cheers when he skated onto the ice for the Cup celebration. Kane has not been charged.
