He chose a livelier place – the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. \n“I’ll have the roasted Falcon,” he said in a commercial two years ago in happier times. \nAs he said, “Check, please” Thursday, the menu read, New Orleans Saints 31, Atlanta Falcons 21. The Saints are just 2-4, and the Falcons, still soaring at 5-1, maintain a filling lead over them nonetheless, but that didn’t matter at least for one night. \nPayton basically hugged the Falcons as if he was Rhett Butler and they were Scarlett O’Hara – you know when he still gave a damn about her. \nThe Falcons came through again when the Saints really needed them. On Sept. 25, 2006, New Orleans really needed Atlanta in the Saints’ first home game back in the dome post-Katrina. \nFinal Score: Saints 23, Falcons 3. \nThat one started with a roof shredding blocked punt by the Saints’ Steve Gleason that Curtis Deloatch recovered and scored for a 7-0 lead. \nGleason, a backup defensive back who retired in 2008 and has been battling Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease) for several years, was at the game Thursday night and watched as a very similar play unfurled before him. \nThis time backup linebacker Michael Mauti blocked the punt and recovered it at the Atlanta 4-yard line and rumbled on in for a 14-0 lead late in the first quarter. And the place never stopped cooking dirty birds, which goes well with dirty rice. \nMauti’s father is Rich Mauti, who was a wide receiver for some of the Saints’ best pre-Jim Mora teams in the late 1970s. The Mautis became the first father-son duo in franchise history to each score touchdowns, unless you count Archie Manning’s 125 touchdown passes from 1971-81 and son Peyton Manning’s interception that was returned 74 yards for a touchdown by cornerback Tracy Porter to seal the Saints’ 31-17 victory over Indianapolis in Super Bowl XLIV in Miami. \nIt was that kind of night again in the dome. Fleeting most likely, but, hey, it was the Falcons. And they’re not undefeated anymore. And thousands of their fans in the dome planned to party for three nights before heading back home. \nHope to see ya. \n“We’re going to have a good time tonight. Let’s celebrate,” Kool & the Gang blared on the dome sound system. “It’s all right.” \nThere are likely not to be too many more victories for the Saints this season, so it’s OK. Party like it’s 2009.
