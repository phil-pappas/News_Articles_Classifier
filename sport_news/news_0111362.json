They were nervous. Their hearts raced. But they were focused. \nImmaculate Heart’s Shannon Burns, Erin Spillane, Molly Younghans, Julianna Shrekgast and Sophia Gulati huddled together Sunday in the admittedly stressful atmosphere just prior to a penalty kick shootout against Ramapo that would determine who moves on to the Bergen County tournament final — and who goes home. \n\"It’s stressful. It’s exciting. It’s anxiety-filled,\" Gulati said after the teams played to a 1-1 draw after 100 minutes of hard-fought, back-and-forth play. \"We prayed before we started it.\" \nThe Blue Eagles’ prayers were answered shortly after, as second-seeded IHA prevailed in penalty kicks, 3-2, behind successful strikes from Burns, Younghans and Shrekgast and two key saves from goalie Kimberly Mains, including a momentum-shifting, diving stop to her right when the Blue Eagles trailed in the shootout, 2-1. \n\"The message to them before they went out for the kicks was, ‘No matter what happens, I love you and I’m proud of you,’ ’’ IHA coach Brandon Silva said. \"I wanted them to enjoy the moment because it’s a great moment for any high school kid. And they came through.\" \nAs third-seeded Ramapo’s final shootout attempt sailed high over the crossbar, the celebration was on. It took a gritty and resilient effort, but the two-time reigning county champions made the necessary plays to secure their spot in their fourth straight tournament final. \n\"This feels amazing,\" said Shrekgast, who gave IHA the initial lead in regulation in the 67th minute after capitalizing on a long-range, rainbow lead pass from Burns down the center of the field. \"We really pulled through and we deserved this. We believed we did. It showed us how we can’t panic and have to remain calm in these situations. And we have to go into the final with that kind of attitude. We can’t panic and we have to stay composed.\" \nIHA showed championship fortitude and poise following Ramapo’s Sommer Cochran’s game-tying score with just 7:31 left. The Raiders, fueled by a cohesive and dominant defense, represented a great challenge for the Blue Eagles, but IHA answered the call to move to 14-3 this season — including a perfect 14-0 against Garden State foes. \n\"We say that pressure is a privilege,\" Silva said. \"Other teams wish they felt the pressure that we face. We have to embrace it, relax and show some of that grit. Reaching a county final isn’t just going to fall into our laps. Ramapo was organized and disruptive. But we needed that grit and we’re starting to find it.\" \nAfter weeks of questions surrounding IHA during a more up-and-down season than it experienced one year ago when it went 22-0, Sunday’s win was all the more satisfying to somewhat silence any critics. \nAnd as the BCT final against national No. 1 Northern Highlands approaches, Burns said the Blue Eagles like being in the underdog role. \n\"We’ve heard how we’re not as powerful as we were last year,\" Shrekgast said. \"But we can’t think like that. We have to think we’re better than we were last year. We’re an amazing team and we can’t doubt ourselves.\" \n\"I’ve got to be honest, I’m not really worried about that stuff,\" said Silva, whose team won the mythical national title last season. \"Less is more for us. If everyone wants to talk more about other teams, that’s fine. We love our little field in the back of our school and we enjoy the moments we have together. That’s what matters most. We like it the way it is. There’s less pressure. We’ve had enough of that from last year.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:45:06.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
