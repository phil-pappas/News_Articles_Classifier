MARIE – The Sault Blue Devils started the “win or go home” portion of their season a week earlier than most teams, needing a win over the Manton Rangers on Friday night to qualify for the postseason. The Devils didn’t leave the outcome in doubt for very long, punching their playoff ticket with a 55-14 win over the Rangers. “You're in,” coach Scott Menard said to the team in the post-game huddle. “We'll deal with who and where on Sunday night after we find out.” Getting to game number 10 was no sure thing early on as it was Manton that got on the board first, hitting on a 55-yard touchdown pass to go up 6-0 after a failed two-point try. The Sault answered the touchdown in its next possession as Justin Fountain scored on a five-yard run with 1:09 left in the first quarter. The run capped a 10-play drive that ate just over five minutes of clock and saw the Devils convert a 4th-and-11 play. The extra point gave the Devils a 7-6 lead. On Manton’s next possession, the Sault forced a three-and-out, but a bad snap on the punt attempt turned into six points for the Blue Devils as Bramdon Petts scooped up the miscue and rumbled 14 yards for the score and a 14-6 lead. Manton’s last score of the contest came on a bit of trickery as the Rangers utilized a fake-punt that went for a 59-yard TD that tied the game at 14-14 “The big play is something we have struggled with all year defensively,” Menard said From that point on, the Sault put the hammer down and dominated. Fountain scored his second touchdown of the night from three yards out with 6:17 left in the first half. Fountain scored three TDs on the night and ran for 162 yards on 20 carries. The next Sault score came from quarterback Nick LaCross on a two-yard run with 1:25 left after a 17-yard pass to Dalton Payton set the Devils up with a first-and-goal. After the keeper, the Sault led 28-14. Any doubt as to how the game might turn out ended in the following 1:30. The Sault kicked off and held Manton on three plays, forcing a 4th-and-13 from Manton’s 14-yard line. Instead of lining up for a punt, the Rangers elected to go for it and were stopped cold, turning the ball back over to the Sault with 12 seconds left. The Devils needed just one play for LaCross to find Peyton for a 14-yard touchdown pass, putting the home team up 35-14. “The only thing that I can think of is that he thought it was third down,” Menard said. “That was a really fortunate break for us and we were able to make a play and take advantage of it.” Page 2 of 2 - Peyton got into the end zone on the Sault’s opening possession of the second half, this time, hauling in a 40-yard strike from LaCross for a 41-14 lead. The two connected five times for 88 yards and the two scores. LaCross was 5-of-7 passing. Peyton caught one pass from backup QB Riley Alaspa for 50 yards to bring his receiving total to 138 yard on six catches. In the fourth quarter, Fountain scored his third touchdown of the night on a 40-yard run, while Hunter Krause found the end zone with 39 seconds left to cap the scoring. The Sault, 6-3, will be making its third trip to the playoffs in four years.
