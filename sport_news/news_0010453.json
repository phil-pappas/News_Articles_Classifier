The team, in turn, made light of his low standing in the polls. \nThe exchange happened Friday after the Ohio governor spotted the Sixers at his hotel. \nAppearing at a town hall in Manchester, New Hampshire, the Ohio governor talked about the importance of having job skills. The Philadelphia Inquirer (http://bit.ly/1Xp4PQi ) reports he then made fun of the Sixers’ basketball skills, saying of the team, “The reason why some of them make a lot of money is because they have skills. Not too many Sixers have had that many skills lately, but they do.” \nThe Sixers immediately fired back on Twitter: “At least we win more than 2% of the time.” The tweet was later deleted. \nThe Sixers are coming off an 18-64 season. \nKasich didn’t seem to mind the gibe, tweeting a video that showed him draining a jump shot. The tweet said “just getting warmed up.” \n___ \nInformation from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:30:17.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
