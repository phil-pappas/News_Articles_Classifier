In addition to losing pit selection, Stewart will serve a 15-minute practice deduction at Kansas. \nOther teams issued warnings stemming from Charlotte include those of Chase driver Jeff Gordon (failing pre-qualifying inspection too many times) and Chase drivers Kevin Harvick and Dale Earnhardt Jr . (both for failing pre-race inspection too many times). \nThe team of non-Chase driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr . was warned for failing pre-race inspection too many times, while the team of non-Chaser Clint Bowyer received two warnings -- one for failing pre-race inspection too many times, and one for failing pre-race inspection templates too many times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:40:11.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
