Consistency has been the key to the 7-footer’s game since the Celtics acquired him from the Cleveland Cavaliers a year ago. His statistics don’t jump off the page, but his presence has been a constant in the Boston starting lineup since early last season. That steadiness appears to have him ticketed to be back there alongside newly acquired David Lee for the Oct. 28 season opener after he got the nod in the first two preseason games in Europe. “He was very good the first week of practice,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “He scored at a really high, high rate. He’s a guy who can add a good roller (to the basket), and is also a capable 16- to 17-foot shooter on offense, and a guy who is capable defensively.” On a crowded roster of big men who flash 3-point range, huge rebounding potential or large personalities, the Indiana native often exhibits a stone-faced expression on the court, a soft-spoken demeanor straight out of America’s heartland in the locker room, and a game that stresses reliability over fantasy league fodder. Only that wasn’t always the case. The same player who let out a lonely single fist pump upon hitting the dramatic, buzzer-beating game-winner against the Utah Jazz at TD Garden late last season said prior to Monday’s practice that the emotions buried deep within him most nights used to tear apart his play. “When I was a little kid, I was all over the place,” he said. “It was something I needed to work on. It was something I try to take pride in now that when coach puts me in he knows what he’s going to get. “Obviously, you will have some nights that are better than others. But I try to put my best foot forward. That’s helped me in my career.” Zeller said it was his father, Steve, who pulled him aside one day when he was in high school and warned him he had to do a better job of keeping it together on the court. “My dad told me: ‘You can’t wear your emotions on your sleeve so much,’” he said. “I was like, ‘Alright,’ so I just started working on it a little bit. “I would get really flustered. I would just get very upset. My whole game would fall apart. I would be terrible. The coach would have to take me out because I wasn’t doing anything right.” These days it’s usually the exact opposite with the 25-year-old third-year pro. On the game-winner against the Jazz, Zeller had the calmness to catch a long inbounds pass from Marcus Smart over the outstretched arms of Utah leaper Rudy Gobert with 1.7 seconds on the clock, spin in the lane, and put in a reverse layup for a pivotal victory in Boston’s surprise playoff surge. He then reacted as if he’d just hit the first of two free throws in the second quarter of an exhibition game. “Two things (about that),” he explained. “You hit a game-winner, but it was my team that got me to the point where I was able to make that play. I didn’t want it to be about me. I wanted it to be about my team. “The second thing was I wanted to make sure I got it off in time. I was trying to look up at the screen and see the replay. I didn’t want to be one of those guys where I do anything crazy, then, ‘Oh yeah, it’s not even good.’” Zeller started 59 of 82 games in the regular season last year after starting only nine for the lowly Cavaliers in his second season. He averaged career-highs of 10.2 points and 5.7 rebounds a game, while shooting 54.9 percent, in 21.2 minutes a night. The competition for minutes in Boston will increase considerably this year with the additions of Lee and free-agent signee Amir Johnson. But Zeller, who added he is still “hopeful” for a contract extension in Boston before the Oct. 31 deadline that would otherwise have him facing restricted free agency at season’s end, said he spent the summer adding some more muscle and building off his familiarity with the Stevens system. “It’s kind of my first year back (with a team in my career) where I’ve known the defensive schemes, the offense, had a feel for everything,” he said “I was able to work on that, gain a few more pounds, do a lot of things in the offseason. “I was able to hold my own (early in camp). But I can’t have a drop off right now.” By Scott Souza", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:51:11.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
