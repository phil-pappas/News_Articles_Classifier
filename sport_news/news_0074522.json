Shareece Wright's embarrassing outing sure helped out his former San Francisco 49ers on a day Baltimore missed chances in every phase. \nColin Kaepernick completed a 76-yard touchdown pass to Smith, Joe Flacco threw two interceptions and the Niners beat Baltimore 25-20 on Sunday to snap a four-game losing streak. \nLISTEN: Full Game Recap: \nPhil Dawson kicked four field goals, including a 53-yarder, in the first win since Week 1 for San Francisco (2-4). Boldin - a Super Bowl star for the Ravens against San Francisco - had a late 51-yard catch that set up Quinton Patton's 21-yard reception for the first touchdown of his career. \nLISTEN: John Harbaugh Post Game Thoughts: \nFlacco's desperation pass to the end zone on the final play went incomplete to Steve Smith, and the quarterback wound up 33 of 53 for 343 yards. Smith dropped two balls in the end zone before catching one. \nKaepernick went 16 of 27 for 340 yards, and Boldin made five catches for 102 yards. \nThe rematch of the Super Bowl three seasons ago featured a pair of last-place teams trying to turn around their seasons, and it showed in some sloppy play. \nBaltimore's previous four losses featured second-half collapses. This time, the collapse all but began from the opening kickoff. \nBaltimore appeared a step behind all day. The Ravens' problems came in pairs, too: Steve Smith's two end-zone drops, two drops by the defense on would-be interceptions and Flacco's two picks. \nEarly in the third with no intended receiver in sight, Flacco threw right to 49ers cornerback Kenneth Acker, who returned the interception 45 yards. \nBaltimore, making its second Bay Area trip in less than a month after a loss at Oakland on Sept. 20, had won four straight against San Francisco, including that 34-31 Super Bowl victory at the Superdome. \nKaepernick had first-and-goal from the 5 and threw three straight incomplete passes intended for Michael Crabtree, and left tackle Joe Staley acknowledged this week the offense prematurely spoke in the huddle of having a championship victory parade. \nRavens safety Kendrick Lewis left with 9:41 remaining in the third because of a knee injury.
