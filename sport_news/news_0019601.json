Caroline Scrafford is the other.\nBoth were sophomores in 2013 when Lake Travis completed comeback to defeat Westalekd 3-2 at Cavalier Gym on Sept. 20, 2013.\nThat was two years ago and since, Westlake is 6-0 against Mulkey and the Cavaliers. Westlake is 9-1 all-time against Lake Travis since the two teams first met in 2012.\n“I was younger (in 2013) and everything was exciting to me then,” Mulkey said.\nOn Friday, Mulkey and Scrafford get their final chance at Westlake (36-6, 15-0 District 14-6A), barring a rare postseason run-in. The two teams will meet at Chaparral Gym at Westlake High School at 6:30 p.m.\nIt won’t be for the district championship. Westlake wrapped that up on Oct. 20 with a 3-0 win over Austin High. It was the Chaparrals’ 15th district championship in volleyball in the last 16 years.\nLake Travis (23-13, 12-2), however, does have something to play for and can avoid a playoff with Bowie for second place with a win over Westlake.\n“If we get third, it puts you head-to-head with the Woodlands,” said head coach Brandace Boren said. “We want to stay away from that.”\nThe last time these two teams met back on Sept. 22, it was Westlake that got the upper hand, but Lake Travis was close in three of the four sets in the 3-1 loss.\nThis time around, Lake Travis comes in with momentum and rest. The Cavaliers last played this past Friday night at home against Austin in a high-contested match that saw Lake Travis came out with a 3-0 win.\n“They want to go into their house and definitely compete to the end,” Boren said.\nAs for this game and likely her final time taking the court in the rivalry, Mulkey said beating Westlake “would be so much fun.”\n“They’ve beaten us so many times in the past and it would just be fun to finally give it back to them,” Mulkey said.\nFRIDAY’S GAME\nLake Travis vs. Westlake, 6:30 p.m. at Chaparral Gymnasium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:21:52.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
