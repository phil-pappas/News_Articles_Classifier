Sarkisian said at the time that although he did not believe he had a drinking problem, he would seek treatment through the USC athletic department.\nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton has been installed as interim coach, Haden said. The Trojans, who began the season ranked No. 8 nationally, are 3-2 after losing 17-12 to Washington — Sarkisian's former team — on Thursday night.\nSarkisian, a former Trojans offensive coordinator, took over as head coach prior to the 2014 season after spending five seasons at Washington.
