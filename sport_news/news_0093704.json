We got three points and that's fantastic.\"\nNeither side was able to dominate the early moments of the match, which came at the same venue where the home side won the Copa America in July.\nBut Chile took over as the match went on to record their first win over Brazil in the South American World Cup qualifiers since 2000.\nBrazil, who were without suspended Barcelona striker Neymar and lacked direction, will aim to get back on the winning track at home to Venezuela on Tuesday, while Chile will travel to Lima to face Peru.\n(Reporting by Felipe Iturrieta, writing by Andrew Downie; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:47:12.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
