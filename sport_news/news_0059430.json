But I said nothing about a paycheck or anything close to that. I know everyone in this building works hard every single day. So I respect that and I would never take a shot like that.\nRelated: How the Dolphins went from marquee name to the NFL’s sunniest garbage heap\n“Am I happy about everything I said? No. [Am I happy] the things went down the way they did? No. I hold myself to a higher standard than to take a shot at something like that.”\nThe Miami Herald reported on Monday that Tannehill got angry when linebacker Chris McCain went in more aggressively than usual for a Saturday practice. Tannehill reportedly said something to the effect that he would prepare a scout team trophy for him.\nTannehill admitted he made negative comments about “a scout team or trophy” after the defense was giving him trouble in practice.\nThe quarterback said: “I was heated, I’m very passionate about this game. I put a lot into it, put a lot into my preparation, how I go about my business every day. And I feel like it’s the day before the game and it’s crucial to our preparation and how we go into a game. I did get upset and said those things, but I talked to those guys and cleared the air with them and we’re moving forward.”\nTannehill had his worst game of the season against the Jets at Wembley. He threw for a season-low 198 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions in the Dolphins’ 27-14 loss. The Dolphins have had a miserable start to the new NFL season, and coach Joe Philbin was fired on Monday with the team 1-3.\nAccording to Tannehill, he spoke to his team-mates afterwards to clear the air, and maintained there were no hard feelings. But on Wednesday he described as “sickening” what he considered to be inaccurate reporting.\n“To put words into my mouth that I didn’t say, to degrade my reputation and what I stand for – honestly it’s sickening to me,” Tannehill said. “On top of that, just the fact that something inside the locker room gets out obviously upsets me as well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:38:58.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
