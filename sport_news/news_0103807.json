Comment Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 2:21 AM By Mike MendezSports Editor Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 2:21 AM BUHLER — Going into the rivalry game against Buhler in Week 8, the stakes were very clear. McPherson had to beat the No. 2 team in the state on its own turf, or miss out on the playoffs. And for the second straight week, big plays cost the Bullpups, losing to the Crusaders 44-28. In spite of the loss, McPherson put together one of its best games of the season when the Bullpups needed it most. “Our guys fought like crazy,” head coach Jace Pavlovich said. “I love this team. We just didn’t quite get it done when we needed to get it done. Buhler is a great team. We haven’t gotten any favors as it relates to our schedule, but our guys, they just play hard to the final whistle and again, I just can’t say how proud I am of them.” Big plays in special teams, with a kick return from Tyson Stites setting up an 18-yard touchdown run from Klayton Goering, and a Jack Reifscheider kick return for a touchdown provided quick strike points for McPherson and kept the Bullpups in the game trailing 16-13 at the half. McPherson got the ball to start the second half and tied the game at 16-16 on the opening drive of the third quarter on a Stites field goal. Then, the turning point in the game happened after a 66-yard Jace Williams touchdown for Buhler gave the Crusaders a 23-16 lead. The Bullpups came right back with a big play of their own on a bubble screen to Jeff Reed that went for 70 yards. Reed was tripped up at the 2, setting up a first and goal from the 2-yard line. The Buhler defense buckled down and kept the Bullpups out of the end zone on four straight plays, three up the middle, and a sweep on fourth down. “That hurt,” Pavlovich said. “That really did. That hurt. We had a chance to get to the perimeter on them on that fourth down, and they made a great play. Their kids play incredibly tough. It would have been nice to get that in. That changes the whole outlook of the game.” After the fourth down play came up short, Buhler took the ball inside the 1, and took it 99 and a half yard on a drive that was capped off with a Williams touchdown pass to Andre Tipton to make it 30-16 Crusaders, and create the separation McPherson couldn’t come back from. But although the Bullpup offense has prided itself on its power running identity, with the season on the line, quarterback Casen Hoover went to work finding receivers in the passing game, and looked like one of the best spread offenses in the state, keeping it a game until the bitter end. Page 2 of 2 - “Our O-line protected well,” Pavlovich said. “Buhler stacks the box. They stack the box on everybody. They have done that for years, and you have to be able to throw against them. We were able to get that done tonight.” In the second half, Hoover, along with receivers Jeff Reed and Reifscheider started carving up the Buhler defense. A 30-yard touchdown pass from Hoover to Reifschneider made it 30-22 with less than eight minutes left in the game. Buhler punched it in on its next play from scrimmage with a long run up the middle for Jack Goertzen. But the McPherson offense was nearly unstoppable throwing the ball. On a 4th and 13 play, Hoover hit Reifschneider again, this time for a 52-yard touchdown pass to cut the lead to 37-28. The Bullpups were in business after a Buhler fumble gave McPherson the ball back. But an interception killed the drive. Buhler running back Dillon Engelland scored on a 76-yard touchdown run to put the game out of reach at 44-28. The Bullpups will finish out the season in Hays next week. And while there won’t be a 10th game for McPherson, there won’t be any lack of fire going out west. “There is a big difference between 5-4, and 4-5,” Pavlovich said. “And I never question the motivation of our guys. They are going to be in it until the end.” Contact Mike Mendez at mmendez@mcphersonsentinel.com and follow him on Twitter @MendezSentinel.
