He remained in the Hillsborough County Jail early Friday with an $8,000 bond. \nPolice say they arrested Robbins after an investigation into the Oct. 11 arrest of freshman player Benjamin Knox. Arrest reports say Knox fired a gun at a dorm on the campus near Tampa. \nIn a statement Friday, university police say they spoke with Robbins early in the investigation and he gave false information. \nEarlier this week, USF suspended Knox, a reserve offensive lineman, from team activities. There is no word on Robbins' status. \nRobbins is charged with discharging a weapon on campus, a second-degree felony, and giving false information to a law enforcement officer. \nA lawyer for Robbins isn't listed on jail records. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:21:19.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
