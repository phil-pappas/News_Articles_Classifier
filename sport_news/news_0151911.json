It's a big honor for me.\" \nAbreu hit .317 with 36 homers and 107 RBIs last season, winning AL Rookie of the Year honors. He has a .292 average and 30 homers to go along with his 101 RBIs. \n\"It's a big accomplishment for him,\" White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. \"All the guys are proud of him.\" \nJonny Gomes drove in three runs to help the Royals move into a tie with Toronto for the AL's best record. Kris Medlen (6-2) pitched six innings of two-run ball, and Ryan Madson tossed a perfect ninth for his third save. \nKansas City played without outfielders Lorenzo Cain and Alex Rios on a windy, cold night, and designated hitter Kendrys Morales (left quad tightness) and catcher Salvador Perez (swelling in right thumb) each departed during the game. Cain was sidelined by a sore right knee, and Rios was scratched because of a stiff back. \nYost used Madson in the ninth because he said closer Wade Davis had a bit of a stiff back. But he said none of the injuries were serious. \n\"They're very trivial, day to day, probably overly cautious concerns,\" he said. \"I mean just trying to do the smart thing.\" \nJohn Danks dropped his third consecutive start as Chicago lost for the seventh time in nine games. The White Sox (74-85) went 7-12 against the Royals in 2015 and have lost the season series to Kansas City in each of the last five years. \nDanks (7-15) was tagged for six runs and 11 hits — matching a season high — in five innings. The left-hander dropped to 10-3 with a 2.87 ERA in 22 career starts against the Royals. \n\"Command wasn't where it needs to be, but I certainly felt like I threw the ball better than the line shows,\" Danks said. \nThe White Sox almost pulled within one in the eighth, but Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera made a nifty tag between his legs to get Alexei Ramirez at the plate for the final out. Ramirez tried to score after a pitch got away from catcher Drew Butera. \nABOUT NEXT YEAR \nU.S. Cellular Field will have three new videoboards next season, according to the White Sox. The main scoreboard in center and the auxiliary screens in left and right field will be replaced. The changes will be paid for by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which owns the stadium. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nRoyals: Cain fouled a pitch off his knee in the seventh inning of Wednesday night's 5-3 victory over the White Sox. \nWhite Sox: Rookie 2B Micah Johnson had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Thursday morning. Scar tissue was removed, and the team said the knee was structurally sound. He is expected to be ready for spring training. ... C Tyler Flowers was shaken up after a foul ball got him in the sixth, but he stayed in the game. \nUP NEXT \nRoyals: Plenty at stake in Kansas City's closing series at Minnesota. The Twins are fighting for the second AL wild card. \nWhite Sox: LHP Chris Sale (12-11, 3.48 ERA) needs three strikeouts to break Ed Walsh's season franchise record of 269 set in 1908. Sale faces Detroit RHP Alfredo Simon (13-11, 5.18 ERA) on Friday night. \nJay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:16:24.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
