(AP) - Prosecutors in Northern California say Oakland Raiders linebacker Aldon Smith has pleaded not guilty to hit and run, drunken driving and vandalism.\nSanta Clara County District Attorney spokeswoman Cynthia Sumida said Wednesday that Smith's attorney entered the not guilty pleas on his client's behalf Sept. 29.\nThe 25-year-old Smith was arrested in August in Santa Clara on drunken driving charges. The San Francisco 49ers then released him. The Raiders signed him five weeks later.\nIn a separate incident, Smith was arrested April 13, 2014, at Los Angeles International Airport. Police said Smith was randomly selected for a secondary screening and became uncooperative with the process, telling a TSA agent that he had a bomb. No charges were filed.\nDuring the 2014 season, he received a nine-game suspension for what the league called violations of its policies on substance abuse and personal conduct.\n__\nThis story has been corrected that Smith now plays for the Oakland Raiders.\n All rights reserved.
