Tough weekend for the Harbaugh brothers after Baltimore coach John Harbaugh's brother Jim's Michigan team lost Saturday to Michigan State on a botched punt. \nOnline:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:42:22.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
