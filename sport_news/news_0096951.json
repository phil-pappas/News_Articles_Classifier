And the other side to that is if you’re too slow in your set then they’ll just beat you upfield. You have to find a happy medium with your sets. The timing is the biggest thing and then the body type of the guy you’re playing against. \n“Inside guys are typically bigger, outside guys are typically more athletic, leaner and they just present different issues.” \nVan Roten has played each position along the line during his career, but he’s quick to point out one difference he’s experienced as an Argo. \n“Never in one season,’’ he quipped. “It’s definitely a challenge to switch from position to position. It’s been an experience, but I’m trying to do my best.” \nWhether Van Roten is the best, only coaches and opponents truly know. \nWhat’s known is that Van Roten has emerged as a very nice piece for the Argos, versatile and intelligent to attack whatever is thrown his way, whether it’s on the fly in game or having the benefit of practice time. \nIn Week 3 when the Argos played in Calgary, Van Roten started at centre. \nThis Saturday, he’ll line up at right tackle. \n“Schematically, they’re all over the place,’’ Van Roten said of the Stamps defence, which is led by co-ordinator Rich Stubler. “Some weeks they’re vanilla, some weeks they’re coming from everywhere. We got to be prepared for everything. \n“It’s the CFL and every week it’s a different animal.” \nELLIOTT NOT AVAILABLE \nIf anything, the Argos have shown that no obstacle is big enough to overcome, no amount of adversity onerous to tackle. \nAnyone who has remotely followed the Argos this season is well aware of the schedule and the unavailability of Rogers Centre with post-season baseball back in town. \nThe Argos will have a home game in Hamilton this Saturday and likely add next Friday’s visit by Montreal to the growing list. \nIt’s not an ideal way of doing business in the cut-throat business of football, but when a starter becomes unavailable, the next-man-up philosophy gets embraced. \nKevin Elliott, one of the many new faces who have made an impact this season, wasn’t at practice Thursday and he won’t be playing against the Stamps for personal reasons. \nOnly once this season has Elliott missed a game, but when the Argos visited Winnipeg in August the receiver didn’t make the trip after he suffered a rib injury. \nElliott has eight receiving touchdowns, one of the primary go-to targets for Trevor Harris in the red zone. \nTori Gurley, another of Toronto’s new faces, leads the team with nine receiving majors. \nKICKING AROUND OPTIONS \nGiven the game of musical chairs the Argos have played this season with their punting game, nothing should ever be considered as a done deal. \nJust when the Argos thought they had signed Billy Pavlopoulos, the Canadian failed to pass his physical. \nEnter Brett Lauther, who was at practice yesterday, the same day injured punter/kicker Swayze Waters ran on the adjoining track for the second day in a row. \nWaters is getting closer and when healthy he gives the Argos their best option, an all-star who can handle all three kicking facets. \nUnless something crazy happens between now and Saturday afternoon’s 4 p.m. kickoff against Calgary as the Argos play a home game in Hamilton, it appears Justin Palardy will serve on all the team’s kicking duties. \nPalardy had a rough game Thanksgiving Monday, missing two field goals, but he was perfect as Toronto won both of its games in Ottawa, the first visit featuring American Michael Palardy along with the Canadian Palardy. \nThe Argos can always bring in an American, but Waters is close and it makes no sense if it means adjusting the ratio. \nfrank.zicarelli@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:07:09.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
