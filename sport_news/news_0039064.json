Adding to the intrigue is the anticipated presence of two-time champion Beholder, the 5-year-old mare who could become the first horse ever to win three different Breeders' Cup events, having taken the 2012 Juvenile Fillies and 2013 Distaff.\nBeholder, who also was pre-entered in the Distaff and whose status is being closely watched after she spiked a fever after shipping from California, missed last year's Distaff after a temperature and illness. Beholder also was pre-entered in the Distaff, a field that will include 2014 winner Untapable.\nThe Classic also attracted Travers winner Keen Ice, the only horse to beat American Pharoah in a year; leading New York older horse Honor Code and Pennsylvania Derby winner Frosted.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nKeeneland Breeders' Cup pre-entries, post times\nThere are 32 overseas horses pre-entered, headed by English Derby winner Golden Horn, who in the $3 million Turf will attempt to be the first Arc de Triomphe winner to capture a Breeders' Cup race. The Turf includes Postponed, winner of England's biggest turf race for older horses, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The American contingent is headed by Big Blue Kitten (winner of Belmont's Joe Hirsch Turf Classic) and The Pizza Man (who beat Big Blue Kitten in the Arlington Million).\nOther defending champions in the Breeders' Cup are Bobby's Kitten (Turf Sprint) and Karakontie (Mile on turf).\nFinal entries will be taken next Monday, at which time horses who are pre-entered in two races must be committed to one. Ten of the 13 events have more than the capacity number that can start, which is 14 for every race but the Dirt Mile and Filly & Mare Turf, restricted to 12 because of the short run into the first turn. There can be up to two also-eligibles in a race, those horses able to draw into the field if there are any defections before scratch time for both days, which is 8 a.m. Oct. 30.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/15649f89223235b673fe512a4c37b66e4a37e523/c=175-78-626-529/local/-/media/2015/01/08/Louisville/Louisville/635563195018830139-2015BreedersCup-Keeneland-logo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:52:13.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
