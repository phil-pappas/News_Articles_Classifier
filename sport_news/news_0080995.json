If you prefer small fish, the Little Lehigh received two stockings of trout, the last of which was on Wednesday, Oct. 14. If you want bigger fish, the Salmon River in New York State has turned on. In fact they even had some snow up there.\nby Tom Marchetto Friend and avid angler, Tom Marchetto, from Northampton County, sent a fishing report from his weeklong visit there last week. Marchetto reports as follows. “Last weeks fishing was a bit slow at best. The first half of the week was spent in the lower half of the river “hunting” for action. We had some success at the “Staircase” hole with hook-ups but very few landings. There were more people (it seemed) fishing there than fish. Weather (then) was warm, in the 70s, and the water temp was in upper 50s (that has changed since then). Some heavy rain Thursday evening and a cooler, off and on rainy Friday, produced the best fishing of the week. Hook-ups were plentiful but landings were again difficult due to the number of anglers on the river. On Saturday, we checked both the north and south Sandy Rivers, which earlier in the week were very low. The rain brought the levels up but not enough to run those rivers. We spent the remainder of Saturday at the “Ballpark” on the Salmon River, which is downstream. We had minimal success due to (once again) more fishermen than fish. Altogether the four of us landed seven kings, one Coho and one very nice steelhead (11-pounds, 28 inches).” Since then conditions and success have improved as per web reports.\nFor even larger fish, the Jersey offshore tuna bite is still going strong says Capt. Howard Bogan of the Jamaica based in Brielle. NJ. They’ve been bringing yellowfins up to 100 pounds over the rails and a few longfins. And the striper bite is beginning to heat up with cooling water temperatures.\nPHEASANT STOCKINGS\nIn the last small game season report, pheasant stocking numbers were not readily available, but the PGC has furnished the following schedule. However, the PGC reminds upland hunters that stocking dates are tentative, but usually occur in a one to four day window within the counties. Note, cockbirds will be noted as C and hens as H.\nLehigh County: Jr. Hunt Oct. 10; 210-C, 450-H; Pre-season (Oct. 24): 270-C, 550-H; In-season (Oct. 27-30): 270-C, 550-H; Nov. 4-6, 180-C, 190-H; Nov. 12-13; 80-C, 110-H; Nov. 19-20; 90-C, 100-H; Dec. 18; 170-H, for a county total of 1,110-C, 2,370-H.\nBerks County: Jr. Hunt; 210-C, 450-H; Oct. 24; 1,770-C, 120-H; Oct. 27-30; 1,770-C, 170-H; Nov. 4-6; 1190-C, 120-H; Nov. 12-14; 580-C, 70-H; Nov. 19-20; 580-C, 40-H; for a county total of 6,300-C, 800-H.\nNorthampton County: No birds were stocked. Upon asking Cheryl Trewella, Southeast Region Information Officer, why, she wrote, “By policy, we are required to have at least 50 acres of suitable habitat to release birds. When you subtract unsuitable habitat, safety zones and areas that are closed to hunting, there are no stocking locations left in Northampton County that meets policy.”\nLooking at the aforementioned stocking numbers, it’s evident Berks County is the best bet for pheasant hunting. There is a lot more suitable farms lands there, with a sizable portion of which, is owned by Mennonite farmers.\nStatewide, the PGC stocked 111,190 cockbirds and 88,810 hens. Here in the Southeast, those numbers are 26,910 cockbirds, 8,490 hens. If it weren’t for the agency’s stocking program, there wouldn’t be any pheasants to hunt. Truly wild, native pheasants of yesteryear are sadly gone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:26:57.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
