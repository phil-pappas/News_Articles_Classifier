Who is Dayton Leroy Rogers?\nDayton Leroy Rogers A. The lawnmower repairman from Canby lived in obscurity until he was accused of killing Jennifer Lisa Smith in 1987. He nearly beheaded the 25-year-old. Witnesses chased Rogers when he fled the scene, a restaurant parking lot in Oak Grove. They provided information that identified him as the killer. Rogers was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1988.\nWhile awaiting trial in the Smith murder, police discovered the nude bodies of seven women in a forested area near Molalla. The women had been stabbed several times and their bodies showed signs of torture and mutilation.\nIn 1989, Rogers was convicted of killing six of the women and sentenced to death. No one has been charged in the death of the seventh woman, who was only recently identified. Rogers is a suspect in that case.\nQ. How did we get here?\nA . The Oregon Supreme Court first overturned Rogers' death sentence in 1992 to comply with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that invalidated Oregon's death penalty statute.\nA jury returned a death penalty verdict again in 1994, but the high court reversed the decision in 2000, ruling the judge should have let the jury consider sentencing Rogers to life without the possibility of parole, an option that didn't exist in his first trial.\nOnce again, in 2006, a jury sentenced Rogers to death. But the Oregon Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that erroneous \"juror anonymity\" procedures prevented Rogers and his attorneys from learning the identities of potential jurors, undercutting their ability to help pick an impartial jury in the 2006 trial.\nThe high court said the trial court judge also erred when he allowed testimony about a homosexual relationship Rogers had as a teenager. Prosecutors failed to introduce evidence demonstrating a link between that experience and the potential of future violence.\nQ. What's changed since the 2006 trial?\nA. More than a dozen witnesses have died, including several of 11 women who testified about their bizarre encounters with Rogers. Stand-ins will read transcripts of the dead witnesses' testimony.\nAmong the deceased is Dr. George Suckow, a psychiatrist who testified that Rogers would always pose a violent threat to others.\nVictims' family members, for the first time, will be allowed to testify thanks to a recent change in the law.\nQ. What will prosecutors tell the jury?\nThey're expected to argue what they have in the three previous trials: that a death sentence is the only appropriate punishment for Rogers, given the enormity of his crimes and his deep-seated sadistic tendencies. Rogers hog-tied, tortured and stabbed many of his victims, cutting the feet off some.\nProsecutors will review Rogers' criminal history before his murder spree. In 1972, at age 18, Rogers stabbed a 15-year-old Eugene girl after taking her to a wooded area to have sex. A year later, he attacked two girls and was sent to the Oregon State Mental Hospital for a year. In 1976, he was convicted in a Marion County case of coercion after hog-tying two teenage hitchhikers in the back of his car.\nIf he gets a true life sentence, Rogers would go into the general population. There's no guarantee that he wouldn't attack another inmate to satisfy his perverse needs, prosecutors have said.\nQ. What will Roger's attorneys tell the jury?\nA. At 62, Rogers is no longer a threat. He's been a model prisoner, an argument they have raised at prior trials.\nJurors will hear about Rogers' dysfunctional upbringing, how he was shaped by his offbeat religious training, harsh discipline and confusion about sexuality and violence.\nRogers was tormented by his father, who showed little affection and killed family pets by gassing them or running over them with a car, according to testimony at his 2006 sentencing.\nFamily members of some victims may ask that Rogers receive a life sentence so they can escape the seemingly endless cycle of legal maneuvering that requires them to periodically relive a nightmare.\nThe defense also is expected to argue that it's less expensive for taxpayers if Rogers gets a life sentence versus paying for years of appeals if he goes back on death row.\nQ. How will the jury determine the sentence?\nA. Jurors have three choices: death, true life and life with the possibility of parole.\nOregon law requires juries in death penalty cases to unanimously agree on four questions. If just one juror votes \"no\" on one question, Rodgers cannot be sentenced to death.\nThe questions: Did Rogers commit his crimes deliberately and knowing they would likely result in death? Is Rogers likely to commit future criminal acts of violence? Was Rogers' conduct in killing his victims unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased? Should Rogers receive the death penalty?\nQ. If Rogers is sentenced to death, what is the likelihood he would be executed?\nIt's possible but unlikely to happen for years, if ever.His case automatically will be appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court -- the first step in a 10-step process that could take a decade or more to complete. So far, the case hasn't made it past the state's high court. Gov. Kate Brown is continuing a moratorium on executions while she studies the issue .\n-- Steve Mayes\nsmayes@oregonian.com\n503-294-5916; @ocmayes", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ocmayes", "http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.150"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:18:47.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
