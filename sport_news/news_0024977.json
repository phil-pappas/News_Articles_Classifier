Having lost their crop to whitefly attack, the farmers are now losing their relief to paddy growers. Sounds strange, but it is true that while paddy growers are getting compensation for damaged cotton, those who suffered actual loss are not in list of eligible persons. In Bakshiwala village, Gurtej Singh had sown paddy on his three acres of land, but got a cheque of Rs5,200 as compensation for cotton crop loss. Kewal Singh of same village got Rs8,000 whereas Basant Singh who uprooted his cotton on one acre and Jagtar Singh whose cotton crop was destroyed on 1.5 acres did not get a single penny. Gurtej Singh said: “I had not suffered any loss, but I accepted the cheque of Rs5,200. I don’t know how the cheque got issued in my name, but I am ready to give the money in the name of our village gurdwara.” Magghar Singh Patwari (revenue official) claimed there was some problem in girdawari report, but cheques were not distributed to people wrongly named. In Harnam Singh Wala and Phulo Mithi villages too cheques were given to paddy farmers. In Reond Khurd village in Mansa district, Jalaur Singh who had sown paddy in his fields got compensation for cotton. In Reond Khurd, cheques in the name of dead people were issued. Himmat Singh is another paddy growere who got compensation for cotton. Bhupinder Singh Rai, Deputy Commissioner, Mansa, said: “We had marked a probe into the faulty girdawari report. We will take action against the patwari concerned, if he is found guilty. In many other villages, there is not such problem.” Beera Singh of Harnam Singh village said: “We sowed cotton on 2 acres of land, but failed to get any yield due to whitefly attack. We are in dire straits, but we got no compensation so far.” Basant Garg, Deputy Commissioner, Bathinda, said: “We will look into the matter and conduct an inquiry.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:19:03.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
