To have that door opened and to see what is on the other side was very gratifying.\" \nThe shot — as well as his reaction — was heartbreaking and brought national and international audiences to their knees. \nBut now he's ready for another season which he said, \"Begins in two weeks.\" \n\"It was heartbreaking, for sure, and there were a few teary-eyed moments,\" Summerhays said. \"But that Sunday afternoon, I laid on my bed for about 10 minutes, let the disappointment set in, and then I got up, clapped my hands and I was ready to go again.\" \nSummerhays' relationship with two other native Utahns also grew during the tour season. Rookies Tony Finau and fellow BYU alum Zac Blair joined him at most major events during the year, and the trio advanced to the same round of the playoffs before failing to make a top-30 finish. Finau, especially, stood out as he made 23 of 34 cuts and finished in the top 10 five times as a rookie. \n\"We had three golfers on tour, three native-born Utahns and they were top 70 in the nation at the BMW Championship. From state to state, I'd say that's a very high ratio,\" Summerhays said. \n\"It's pretty neat to have some other Utah guys out there.\" \nFinau hopes the shot of so many Utah natives making it on tour helps grow the game in the Beehive State. And his Tony Finau Foundation also hopes to use the game to help disadvantaged and inner-city children learn to love golf and earn an education. \n\"I feel like I've been really blessed to be in the position that I am, to start giving back already,\" Finau said. \"And that's what the Tony Finau Foundation is all about.\" Daniel Summerhays finished the BMW Championship at Conway Farms Golf Course tied for 41st with a 5-under-par 279 in the third tournament of the FedEx Cup playoffs, and dropped to 31st in the overall standings — one spot away from qualifying for the final stop of the FedEx Cup, the Tour Championship. Lehi's Tony Finau finished 43rd in the standings, and BYU alum Zac Blair was 59th. \n\"I was happy with a lot of my play, and I know a lot of places I need to work on,\" said Finau, who finished tied for seventh or better at 31 events in 2015, including top 15 finishes at the U.S. Open and PGA Championship. \"I played in a lot of golf tournaments and I was extremely tired toward the end. I'm going to play a little less, and hopefully have a little bit more energy at the end to make a run. \n\"I learned a lot about myself and hopefully I can compete with the best in the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:22:31.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
