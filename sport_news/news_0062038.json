We gotta have the same mentality as we did when we dropped the first one back home. We need to try and even this one out and get back to The K and see what happens after that,\" first baseman Eric Hosmer said.\n \"We gotta stay confident. We'll see what happens tomorrow. We're gonna come ready to go and give it our all and see what happens,\" outfielder Lorenzo Cain stated.\n\"None of us are ready to go home, So we'll go back out there and play to our strengths, pitch to our strengths and go get it because nobody is gonna give it to us,\" pitcher Danny Duffy said.\n\"We've come too far as a team, and we realize we're one loss away from our season being over. But, we can't think like that. We gotta go out here tomorrow and just play the game and do what we can\" Hosmer exclaimed.\nThere's even more on the line for Royals left fielder Alex Gordon. If the Royals don't win Monday, that could be Gordon's last game as a Royal.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
