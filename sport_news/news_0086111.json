It was a leaping catch last week that required concentration, the ball from quarterback Connor Christiansen dropping out of the rainy sky just beyond the fingertips of a fully extended Towson cornerback and into McCray’s raised hands. “I really wasn’t focused on the defender because I was focused on the ball,” he said. “Connor threw it to the back shoulder, so I kind of turned around, just reached my hands up.” There was no time to celebrate for the true freshman receiver from Williams High School. Elon was beginning to climb out of a 13-0 hole, McCray’s catch helping propel the Phoenix toward putting together a comeback that produced its first-ever victory in the Colonial Athletic Association. Plus, tight end Zach Duprey and a stream of teammates arrived soon after he scored with congratulations. And in that moment, McCray wasn’t exactly bursting with creative end zone ideas, either. “In practice you always say, ‘This is what I’m going to do. This is my celebration move,’” he said. “But nothing even came to mind. My teammates were running up to me. Felt like the entire team came up to me and said, ‘Good job.’” For good reason. As Elon’s mostly veteran defense has turned in sturdy and swarming performances recently, its young offense has struggled for points and starved for momentum-generating plays. While McCray’s 35-yard touchdown reception covered a modest distance compared to some over-the-top bombs, it created the type of big impact and burst the Phoenix has needed. All from a quick glance and simple gesture. “It’s one of those things where you look over and he knows, ‘The ball’s coming, so I need to bust it,’” Christiansen said. “It was just man coverage, no safety help and Tereak’s fast, very explosive off the line. I knew he was going to win it. “Little nod, just tried to make eye contact. And he knew we were about to make a play.” McCray’s three catches for 65 yards in the 17-13 defeat of Towson marked the top yardage game for an Elon receiver this season. Early in the second half, he went low to haul in a 21-yard pass from Christiansen that set up a first-and-goal from the 5-yard line. Elon scored on the next play to go ahead to stay. Page 2 of 3 - That had Christiansen issuing thanks and apologies. Under pressure in the wet weather, he wasn’t able to zip the throw. McCray, open and on the run, possibly could’ve scored again if not for having to adjust to the ball. “Right when I threw it, I kind of held my breath a little bit,” Christiansen said. “I got up and got my eyes to the sideline for the next play and I just heard Connor on the side of my ear,” McCray said. “He was like, ‘I’m sorry, man.’ “It was a good throw to me because he got it to me. I didn’t even think about him needing to apologize.” Both Elon coach Rich Skrosky and Christiansen are quick to mention dedication and work ethic when McCray, who’s 18 years old, becomes the subject of conversation. “He wants to get better every day,” Skrosky said. “You can tell in just the way he practices. He’s got great drive and he knows he’s not close to being the player he’s going to be. That’s maybe the thing that excites me most about him. “He’ll be in early. He’ll stay late. And that goes back to when he got here in the summer.” McCray left Tuesday’s practice hobbled with a thigh bruise and clearly frustrated with not being able to finish the session. During training camp in August, a hamstring injury sidelined him for several practices and two scrimmages, slowing his preseason development. Months earlier, he was on campus and diving into Elon’s summer training program two days after his high school graduation. “Got right to work,” he said. “Really didn’t have a summer.” The 5-foot-9 McCray played a multitude of positions at Williams, including quarterback, running back, receiver, defensive back and punter. Former high school quarterbacks have shined at slot receiver in Skrosky’s offense. Lance Camp and one-time Cummings standout Bo Williamson are two prime examples, both elusive dual-threat quarterbacks on the prep level who converted to standouts in the slot at Elon when Skrosky was an assistant under Pete Lembo from 2006-10. “I always feel like those guys, they understand football, now they’ve got to understand how to play receiver,” Skrosky said. “I think each week Tereak gets more and more comfortable, not only with the offense, but with the game plans, the hand signals, the checks and splits and all those things. “As a young player, taking in all the information you’re given, not only schematically but technically, and not letting it affect your athleticism, that’s hard.” Page 3 of 3 - McCray ranks third in catches (11) and second in receiving yards (107) for the Phoenix on the season. He and teammate Corey Joyner, another true freshman slot receiver, appear to have the potential to form a playmaking duo for years to come at Elon. Christiansen said he sensed McCray would be bent on progress before he joined Elon’s team. In the spring, when Christiansen went for haircuts in Burlington, he’d stop in at Body Unlimited, the gym next door. “I would see Tereak in there all the time,” Christiansen said, “shirt off, sweating and working hard. Stuff like that, you know this guy wants to be good. He’s the kind of player that you want, putting in the individual effort behind the scenes.” Kickoff Who: Elon (2-2, 1-0) at No. 20 New Hampshire (2-2, 0-1) When: 3:30 p.m. Saturday Where: Cowell Stadium, Durham, N.H.
