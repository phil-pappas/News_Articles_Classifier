Linebacker Tank Carder wore a red caution jersey.\nThe Browns also had a few additions to the injury report this week coming off the Broncos game: tight end Gary Barnidge (ankle), nosetackle Danny Shelton (ankle), linebacker Nate Orchard (groin) and defensive tackle John Hughes (knee). They will likely be listed as limited.\nOn the other hand, running back Duke Johnson, who was checked for a concussion during the Broncos game and suffered a shoulder injury, is not on the injury report and will face the Rams. Also, quarterback Josh McCown, who was limited with an ankle injury all last week, is no longer listed.\nPettine said more help is on the way too. Rookie cornerback Charles Gaines (hamstring), who's been on short-term injured reserve with a pulled hamstring, began practicing Wednesday and can be activated after Week 8.\nRunning back Glenn Winston, who's on the reserve/non-football injury list with a knee injury, also returned to practice Wednesday.\n\"We'll work them in slowly,'' said Pettine.\nIn other quick-hitters from Pettine:\n• He said the top four receivers \"are entrenched'' and indicated it will be tough for Dwayne Bowe to get on the field anytime soon. He said after the top four, the ability to play special teams is imperative.\n• He said the 32nd-ranked run defense is \"a source of frustration and probably the biggest issue we deal with here.''\n• He said he's very eager to see what Gaines can do, especially after a promising performance in training camp.\n• He said rookie tight end E.J. Bibbs \"is in the conversation'' to be active this week with Housler struggling with the hamstring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:10:03.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
