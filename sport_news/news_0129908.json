Comment   By Cole Sherman Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 4:47 PM By Cole Sherman Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 4:47 PM DEWITT — Dewitt came close to a program altering victory Friday night as they hosted Pine Bluff Dollarway at Dragon Stadium. Using a big first quarter, the Dragons led for most of the ball game, before eventually falling 22-19 to the perennial conference favorites. As it is, the loss drops the Dragons to below .500 overall, and 0-2 in 8-4A play. The Dragon faithful, as always, was out in force Friday night, hoping for a win to push their team into contention for a playoff spot. The Dragons would be hard pressed to find a more unlikely victim, as Dollarway holds a 7-0 mark in the series dating back to 2001. It looked for most of the game however, that this season would be different. The Dragons cashed in on two early Dollarway turnovers, and found itself holding a 19-0 lead at the end of the first period. Dewitt’s running game was as strong as ever, and the Dragons scored on each of their three, first quarter possessions. Unfortunately, with the end of the period, came the end of the scoring for Dewitt. By the time that the halftime horn sounded, the Cardinals had closed the margin to 19-6, but still Dewitt looked to be in control of the contest. The Dragon’s offense consumed yardage on the ground during the first half, with Dollarway finding no answer. With both teams heading to the locker room, Dewitt was a short time away from their biggest win in over two decades. In the second half, while the offense could find no points, the Dewitt defense forced Dollarway to earn every yard. At the close of the third quarter, the Cardinals had closed the scoring gap to 19-14, but the Dragons still held firmly to the lead. That is, until Dollarway’s Markell Scott found daylight on a 74 yard scoring run to put the Cardinals ahead 20-19. The two point conversion made the score 22-19. The touchdown did not come without controversy however. It looked on film as though Scott’s knee might have been down early in the run, but nevertheless, the score stood, and Dewitt found itself without the lead that it had nursed for the entire game. Dewitt would have two more opportunities to take back the lead, but the Dragon offense found no traction, and the clock ran out as the Dragons lost a heartbreaker. Dragon Coach Mark Courtney was very pleased with most aspects of the game, but one area stood out as troubling for the first year Dewitt coach. “ I think we outplayed Dollarway in every phase of the game. It is unfortunate for the kids, but there were nine different game changing calls that affected the outcome of this game,” Courtney said. Page 2 of 2 - While the way the game was officiated did not please Courtney, he was pleased with his player’s performance. “ Our guys never gave up, and they did not let the officiating affect their effort or focus. It is very unfortunate for the kids, but I am sure they will show up and go directly back to work for Crossett,” he said. There are several positives to be gleaned from last week’s effort. For starters, the Dragon rushing attack chewed up the Dollarway defense for most of the game. Dewitt rushed 51 times Friday night for 320 yards, good for a 6.3 yard per carry average. Jamerious Bradford led the Dragons by carrying the ball 27 times for 150 yards and a score. Malik Brasfield contributed 63 yards on 11 carries, including two scores. According to Courtney however, the offensive line is where most of the credit should go. “ The Offensive line was great, we averaged 6.3 yards per carry, so all of them need to be commended. Nick Wright, Taveon Bell, Banks Philipp, Luke Mitchell, Samm Golden, they were very good Friday night,” he said. In addition to the rushing attack, the Dragon defense played well for most of the night. Jamari Gamble and McCoy Sollars led Dewitt with five tackles each. Tru Hobbs added 4.5 tackles of his own, as well as a forced fumble. Combined, the Dewitt defense held Dollarway to their second lowest point output of the season. Up next for the Dragons is the biggest game of the year, when they host Crossett. It would seem unlikely that the Dragons are able to make the postseason without finding a way to win this week. The Dragons have a ton to build on however, and with a little help from the passing game, and maybe a little less help from the officials, Dewitt could be on their way to a postseason berth.
