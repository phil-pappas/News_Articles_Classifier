(DAVE MUNCH/STAFF PHOTO / Carroll County Times) Pat Stoetzer Contact Reporter Carroll County Times North Carroll won its first outright county title sine 2002 \nEmma Sobolewski's name might not be the first one mentioned in a conversation about North Carroll's field hockey team, and she's just fine with that. \nSobolewski seems quite comfortable in her clean-up role around the opposing team's cage, as her assist-less season can attest. But again, no problem for the Panthers' junior forward. \nShe knows what is asked of her, and this season she has done the job. Sobolewski did it again Thursday, with time running out in the inaugural county championship game against Westminster. \nAt South Carroll High School, in front of perhaps the biggest non-playoff crowd to watch a Carroll field hockey game, Sobolewski got her stick on a loose ball just enough to knock it in and give North Carroll a 1-0 win. \nSobolewski scored with 1 minute, 35 seconds remaining, a few moments after Westminster received a yellow card and had to play with one less player for the final 2:16. The Panthers (12-3) drew a penalty corner, and junior Zoe Rosner inserted the ball toward the top of the circle. Meghan Harmon, another junior, sent the ball toward Owls goalie Kerri Virtz. Before it got there, senior Jensyn Koontz got her stick on a pass. \nWith a host of legs and sticks creating chaos in front of Virtz, Sobolewski said she was overcome with a moment of clarity. \n\"I'm standing there and it's like, it stops. The whole world stops,\" Sobolewski said. \"When Meghan hit the ball in there, it's like, if I miss this, this is our whole season. ... When the goal went in, I just looked at Jensyn, and I looked at my whole team. I put my hands on my head and I started crying. I was like, 'This is so crazy.'\" \nAfter collecting her 14th goal of the season, Sobolewski and her teammates had 95 seconds to stave off a charge from Westminster (9-6) before they could officially celebrate claiming the Panthers' first outright county title since 2002. \nCarroll County Athletic League rules allow for division winners to meet at season's end to determine the county champions. North Carroll, which won the Cowan Division with a 6-1 county record, had to face the Hersh Division champion Owls (also 6-1) for a second time this season. \nThe Panthers won the regular-season meeting 2-0, but Westminster had lost only once since its Sept. 24 setback in Hampstead before Thursday. And the Owls controlled the ball for most of the first half, with four penalty-corner tries to NC's three. \nA few scoring chances came from close range, but Westminster had little to show for its offensive attack through 30 minutes. A shift in defense helped North Carroll zero in on Owls freshman forwards Veronica Maring and Haleigh Moore in the second half, said NC coach Denean Koontz. \nLed by juniors Theresa Effingham and Caroline McManus, Westminster was denied any serious scoring threats in the second half. \nVirtz sparkled in goal with 14 saves — she stopped Panthers junior Mackenzie Poist on a breakaway with 12:20 to play in the first half — and Westminster's defense, led by senior Mia Moshang and junior Lauren Rogalski, kept things close, but North Carroll did enough to earn the victory. \n\"That's what you want a county championship game to be,\" Koontz said. \"Both teams played hard, both teams played well. We capitalized on the opportunity in the end, and take nothing away from [Virtz], she had a heck of a game.\" \nMany of the Owls were visibly upset following the game, but coach Katie Corson said she tried to tell them there's more season to be played. The regional playoffs begin Tuesday, and like North Carroll, Westminster has a state championship to defend. \n\"This is the start to our postseason,\" Corson said. \"I said, 'Keep your heads high. Thursday is our first playoff game, and that's what matters.' This was just the county title. Yeah, it would be great to say that we're county champs, but North Carroll's a good team so they also deserve it.\" \nGoals: NC-Emma Sobolewski. \nSaves: NC-2 (Lily McConnell); W-14 (Kerri Virtz). \nHalftime: Tied, 0-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:11:01.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
