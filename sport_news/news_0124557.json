The Academy Tigers play at Lake Havasu City tonight. (JC AMBERLYN/Miner) Shawn Byrne   After taking down the Kingman High Bulldogs 49-14 last week for their first win of the year, the Kingman Academy Tigers have been feeling pretty good about themselves. For their reward, the Tigers play at No. 4 Lake Havasu in a Division IV, Section III game at 7 tonight.\"Our kids are feeling some momentum now that we got that win,\" said KAHS football coach Dan Stroup. \"Lake Havasu has a lot of kids and its backups are as good as its starters. We're a small school going up against a giant.\"Lake Havasu reported a student population of 1,864 pupils, and the Academy disclosed 386.\"We did well last week and finally opened the can on offense,\" Stroup said. \"If we can control the ball and keep them off the field that will limit their offensive plays.\"Havasu (8-0, 5-0) is averaging 343 yards per game of offense. Jacob Kalogonis leads the Knights with 823 yards rushing in eight games and 17 touchdowns. Louie Gonzales and Austin Scubule have combined for 12 additional scores, and quarterback Jack Warner has completed 67 percent of his passes for 1,016 yards and seven TDs with no interceptions.When the Academy (1-7, 1-4) has the ball, the Tigers will rely on running backs Clayton Holloway and Jordan McDowell-Seybert. Holloway has 491 yards and three TDs in six games, and McDowell-Seybert has 697 yards and seven scores in eight games.The problem lies with Havasu's defense. The Knights have surrendered just 14 points while scoring 346 on the season.\"If we can score, that'll be amazing,\" Stroup said. \"We'll see how much we've improved this week. By no means are we mailing it in.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:26:37.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
