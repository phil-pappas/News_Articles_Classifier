Indiana ranks 127th, Nebraska 128th. \n4 — Four Big Ten players have 200-yard rushing yards this season. One is Ohio State’s Ezekiel Elliott (274 yards at Indiana). The others are Iowa’s Jordan Canzeri (256 vs. Illinois) and Akrum Wadley (204 at Northwestern), and Indiana’s Jordan Howard (203 vs. Western Kentucky). \n5 — Wisconsin held its fifth opponent to 10 points or less in its 24-7 win over Purdue. \n16 — Purdue was held under 300 yards for the 16th time in Darrell Hazell’s 31 games as the Boilermakers’ coach. \n25 — Rutgers was behind by 25 points with three minutes left in the third quarter, then rallied for a 55-52 win at Indiana. \n59 — Nebraska has a 3-4 record, but has outscored its opponents by a total of 59 points. \n178 — Iowa has outrushed its three Big Ten foes by an average of 178 yards, 239-61. \n194 — True freshman Saquon Barkley rushed for 194 yards in Penn State’s 38-10 loss at Ohio State, and had a 44-yard touchdown run called back because of a holding penalty. \n212 — Michigan had its shutout streak stopped at 212 minutes (and 11 seconds). \n301 — Mitch Leidner passed for a career-high 301 yards for Minnesota. Predictably, that was a bad sign for the run-favoring Gophers, who lost 48-25 to Nebraska. \n597 — Northwestern has been outgained by 597 yards (975-378) in the last two games, in losses to Michigan and Iowa. \n627 — Indiana gained 627 yards and still lost to Rutgers. Which was a reversal of its first game of the season, when it allowed 659 yards to Southern Illinois but managed a 48-47 victory. \n3,028 — Ohio State junior Elliott topped the 3,000-yard career rushing mark with 153 against Penn State. He is the ninth Buckeye to hit 3,000. Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:12:31.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
