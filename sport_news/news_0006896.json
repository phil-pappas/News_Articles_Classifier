To get you ready for the 7:30 p.m. kickoff on the SEC Network here is a roundup of all The Courier-Journal’s coverage leading up to the game \nCats hope youth prevails at Mississippi State : “It's going to be a tough environment (against) a very mature, good football team that's got an unbelievable guy back there behind center taking snaps,” Stoops said. “A great coaching staff and a group that's used to winning a bunch of games, so it's going to be a real challenge for us.” \nUK-Mississippi State | 3 keys and a prediction : “Two consecutive years of close losses against Mississippi State should give Kentucky plenty of confidence heading into the trip to Starkville, but that confidence will not make the task of stopping Dak Prescott any easier. The guess here is the game plays out much closer than the point spread would suggest, but Kentucky falls just short again.” \nFive Questions | Breaking down Mississippi State : “Kentucky will look to bounce back from its second loss of the season in a road trip to Mississippi State Saturday. What’s the mood in the Bulldogs’ camp? Michael Bonner, the Mississippi State beat writer for The Clairon-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., stopped by to answer five questions about the Bulldogs.” \nUK players brace for Starkville cowbells : “My cousin married a graduate of Mississippi State and they played cowbells at their wedding,” UK quarterback Patrick Towles said. “It was horrible. It was loud and annoying, but it’s their thing, you know? It’s kind of cool. They all have it and it’s a tradition, which I appreciate. But I don’t anticipate it bothering us at all.” \nFive-star Elam’s time arrives for UK football : “I think it will make him grow up a little faster,” UK defensive line coach Jimmy Brumbaugh said. “Sometimes when you have another person in front of you, you kind of coast a little bit. But now he’s the man, so he has to perform, because everyone’s on his back.” \nLewis injury leaves emotional impact at UK : “Because Melvin’s worked his tail off,” UK head coach Mark Stoops said. “He’s overcome a bunch of adversity. He cares so much. He’s a great leader. He’s playing good football. I mean, he’s a big part of the heart and soul of our defense. And to see him and what that means to him, it’s very difficult.” \nAuburn play latest highlight for Conrad : \"If someone thinks of a tight end, the (Rob) Gronkowskis and stuff of the world, that’s what they want from him,\" freshman tight end C.J. Conrad said. \"If you picture it, that’s what they do. So if you see someone do that for a team who hasn’t had a tight end doing that a lot that excites people.\" \nStamps preps for return to Mississippi : “Being against my home state, going back home, that lights fuel to the fire or whatever, but I’m just going to go out there and stick to the game plan and hopefully I can come down with one,” senior safety A.J. Stamps said. \nReport Card | UK football through six games : “At the halfway point of the 2015 season, Kentucky actually has one fewer win than the same point a year ago, but there is little doubt UK is an improved team. How improved? Here’s a look at the midseason UK report card.” \nWR Thaddeus Snodgrass to transfer : “Redshirt freshman wide receiver Thaddeus Snodgrass, who had yet to catch a pass this season, opened the season as the backup to sophomore wide receiver Dorian Baker but disappeared from the depth chart before Kentucky’s Oct. 15 game against Auburn.” \nUK commitment Wood eager to compete at QB : “They’ve given me the opportunity to go in and compete at the quarterback spot,” Lafayette High School junior Walker Wood said. “That’s my goal, and I’m going to work my butt off to go and do that.” \nUK releases pre-Mississippi State depth chart : “As expected, sophomore defensive lineman Matt Elam took over the No. 1 spot at nose guard for the injury Melvin Lewis on the new UK depth chart released Monday in advance of the trip to Mississippi State.” \nVideo | UK football-Mississippi State week : Player and coach interviews from Kentucky’s pre-Mississippi State practices. \nPractice Reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:46:34.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
