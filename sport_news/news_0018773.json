By CHRIS CASEY ccasey @shawmedia.com \nAURORA – Aside from Tuesday’s match at Marmion providing a good nonconference opponent for St. Charles East, the Saints were going into a place where the Cadets boys soccer team hasn’t lost in over three years. \nMitch Dorsey scored less than a minute into the game for his first of two goals to give East a lead it did not relinquish as the Saints defeated Marmion, 5-1, in the nonconference matchup. \nFor the Cadets, it was the first time they have been defeated at home since Oct. 10, 2012, a 2-1 loss to Wheaton Academy. \n“It’s tough for that kind of streak to end in a game like this,” Marmion coach Ricky Del Toro said. “They had much more effort than we did and with their 1v1 ability, that’s really an area in which we struggle. [East] is a good team and were much better than us tonight.” \nDorsey and fellow senior forward Jasminko Dizdarevic scored two goals each, while Justin Stepien added a goal late for the Saints’ fifth goal. \nEast (12-5-4) is now unbeaten in its last nine matches and, after a slow start to the season, really seems to be hitting its stride at the perfect time. \n“We came into this season with a lot of guys who had never been on varsity before, including myself,” junior defender Jack Kempff said. “I think it took us a couple weeks playing together to figure out everyone’s strengths. Once we figured that out, we were able to string some wins together and really took off.” \nDorsey’s opening goal came 41 seconds into the match on what seemed like a misplayed ball by Marmion goalkeeper Matt Fletcher. The Cadets (9-6-3) didn’t waste time striking back, when Sean Miller’s shot from outside the box found the upper left corner to tie the game. \nDorsey struck back in the 33rd minute to give the Saints a 2-1 halftime lead. \nEast started both halves strong as Dizdarevic scored just over a minute into the second half, which seemed to be a back-breaker for Marmion. \n“It’s great that we have a number of guys that can put the ball in the net,” Dizdarevic said. “Our guys have confidence to get the job done. We have great depth on this team, and we’re confident that someone is going to come out and score, no matter who it is.” \nEast coach Paul Jennison knew there were things that \nhis team could have done better Tuesday night, but a four-goal win is certainly never going to be something that upsets him. \nThe Saints came in not knowing a whole lot about the Cadets, which is similar to the feel many teams will have with the postseason just around the corner. \n“I told the lads at halftime today that this was playoff soccer,” Jennison said. “I think Marmion is an extremely physical group and have some great athletes and they can punish you if don’t react to some things they do.” \n“We know we’re not going to be able to play the way we want to every time we take the field,” Jennison added. “After recognizing that in the first half, that plan B was essential. Again, with that Conant (regional) game in mind next week, we were able to put some of that game planning into effect today and got a positive result.” \nAside from the fact that East has a good amount of players on the roster that have tallied goals this year, it has been the defensive effort that has impressed most. The Saints have registered four shutouts in their last nine games and have limited teams’ scoring chances as the year has gone on. \nKempff is someone that Jennison said ‘always works hard and doesn’t get some of the credit he deserves,’ but along with seniors Brandon DiOrio and Tyler Champine in the back line, East’s defense has been as strong as any around over the past few weeks. \n“The defense has just been playing very compact lately,” Kempff said. “We’re able to just stick with our guy and have great communication. It doesn’t hurt that we have some height on the back line as well.” \nSteve Owens (5 saves) and Kevin Cook (2) each played a half in goal for the Saints in the win. Fletcher made five saves in goal, taking the loss for Marmion. \nEach team has one game remaining in the regular season, both Thursday, as the Cadets host Wheaton Academy and East will host Elgin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:54:50.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
