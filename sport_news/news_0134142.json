Hiring in July and August was revised lower by 59,000.\nThe unemployment rate remained 5.1 percent, but only because more Americans stopped looking for work. The proportion of Americans working or searching for jobs fell to a new 38-year low.\nAverage hourly wages also slipped by a penny and have risen a tepid 2.2 percent in the past year.\nU.S. consumers are spending at a healthy pace, boosting job gains in sectors like retail and hotels and restaurants. But lackluster growth overseas has sharply reduced exports of factory goods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:44:26.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
