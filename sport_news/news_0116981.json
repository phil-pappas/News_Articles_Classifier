The person spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday because the team has not announced his departure. Mattingly, who had managed the team for five years, agreed with the Dodgers to mutually part ways, the person said. Front office officials are expected to address his departure at a news conference later Thursday. Los Angeles was 446-363 under Mattingly, finishing with a winning record in every season and winning the last three NL West titles. But the Dodgers have not reached the World Series since winning the title in 1988. The 54-year-old former Yankees star ranks sixth in wins among Dodgers managers.
