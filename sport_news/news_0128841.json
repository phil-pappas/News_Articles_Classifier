Kyle Keller went 11-27 in the air for 172 yards and a touchdown. Terrell Crawford caught five passes for 98 yards while Chad Nolan had three catches for 66 yards and a score.\nNSU (2-5, 2-5 MIAA) picked up a game on the defensive side as Darian Morris had nine tackles, two fumble recoveries, including a return for a 97-yard score, as well as an interception and three pass break ups.\nThe Southern defense forced three-and-outs on the first two NSU offensive drives, but huge punts from the RiverHawks put the Lions inside their own ten-yard line each time and Southern would punt on each possession.\nNSU got on the board first when Zac King took a 37-yard pass from Kevin Pantastico to the end zone and the RiverHawks led 7-0 after the first quarter.\nThe Lions got on the board midway through the second half when Michael Nelson started things with a 33-yard punt return to put Southern on the NSU 38-yard line. Gregory then put in runs of 21, six and 11, the finale being for a score as Southern tied the score at seven with 8:48 left to go in the half.\nPantastico had passes of 33, 25 and 40 yards to lead the RiverHawks to a score with 49 seconds left to put NSU up 14-7.\nThe Lions, however, drove the field and set up a 45-yard field goal attempt from Brock Renken but the kick was off the left upright and NSU led 14-7 at the break.\nSouthern opened up the second half and drove down to the NSU one-yard line, but Keller fumbled on a fourth-and-goal situation and the RiverHawks picked up the loose ball and returned it 97-yards for a touchdown. NSU added another score with 4:23 left in the third quarter to go up 28-14.\nA Lions' turnover late in the third quarter led to NSU moving deep into Southern territory as the game moved to the fourth quarter and the RiverHawks converted a 20-yard field goal to go up 31-14.\nTJ Fleeton completed a late scoring drive with a 25-yard passing touchdown to Nolan to cut the lead to ten at 31-21. The Lions would then attempt a brilliant onside kickoff attempt, but would be called for kick interference after NSU had signaled for a fair catch. That would be how the game ended.\nDefensively, Kyjuan Tate led the Lions with ten tackles and a sack. David Smith had a sack, as well, as the Lions had five tackles for a loss in the game.\nSouthern will be back in action next Saturday as the Lions will play host to Lindenwood for Homecoming 2015. Kickoff from Fred G. Hughes Stadium inside the Robert W. Plaster Sports Complex is slated for 2:30 pm. The game will be televised as part of the MIAA TV Package.", "external_links": ["http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=801", "http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=2287", "http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=2349", "http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=760", "http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=2253", "http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=783", "http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=2248", "http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=794", "http://mssulions.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=786"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:24:08.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
