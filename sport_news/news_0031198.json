What was the point? \nBut for the Rochester Institute of Technology men’s hockey team, Saturday’s 2-2 tie with Bowling Green was perhaps a bit more tolerable. \nBowling Green came into night ranked 10th in the country. The Tigers, meanwhile, were trying to find something to feel good about after a pair of distressing losses last weekend. In that regard, it was mission accomplished. \n“Now we have some more belief in ourselves,” RIT coach Wayne Wilson said. “We can say, ‘That’s what a 10th-ranked team looks like.’” \nThey also will say they should have won Saturday’s game. The Tigers led for 50 minutes and 44 seconds, as Todd Skirving scored a pair of early first-period goals just 25 seconds apart. They also outshot the Falcons 16-8 in the third period.

Both goalies — Mike Rotolo for RIT and Chris Nell for Bowling Green — made sure it stayed 2-2 through the five-minute overtime. \nAnd, instead of a downtown hockey celebration for 10,566 fans at sold-out Blue Cross Arena at the Rochester Community War Memorial, RIT’s Brick City Homecoming game ended without a winner. \n“It’s frustrating; you never want a tie game,” said Skirving, a junior forward who scored just four goals in 39 games last season. “You always want to win. If you don’t want to win, I don’t know why you’re playing. \n“But we can take a lot of positives from that game.” Buy Photo \nRIT's Danny Smith eyes the puck on his stick as he looks to control it on Oct. 17, 2015.

That’s the worst two-game goal differential since RIT became an NCAA Division I program in 2005-06. \nSo after a week of high-energy practices, the Tigers responded. They generated plenty of offensive-zone riding time. They held the Falcons to 29 shots. Rotolo played very well in goal, with little to no chance to stop either shot that beat him. \n“I thought we actually outplayed them,” Rotolo said. \nThe annual Brick City game has not been kind to RIT. Fans always flock to the one off-campus home game of the regular season; this was the sixth consecutive sellout for the homecoming game. But the Tigers are just 2-5-2, and winless in the past four (0-3-1). \n“I’ve never won a (Brick City) game here,” senior defenseman Alexander Kuqali said. “But if we keep doing what we did tonight, I’m not going to be worried.” \nKEVINO@gannett.com Buy Photo \nRIT's Todd Skirving, right, celebrates his second goal of the first period at the Blue Cross Arena at the Community War Memorial on Oct. 17, 2015.
