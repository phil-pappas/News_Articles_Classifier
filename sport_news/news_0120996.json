And twice, the sophomore outside hitter out of Modesto-Gregori High answered with a kill to fend off match point in Game 5 of Pacific’s West Coast Conference volleyball match against USF on Tuesday at Spanos Center. LaBass had a career-high 18 kills in the Tigers’ 25-19, 23-25, 25-20, 26-28, 19-17 win in their home opener over the Dons. Her contribution in pressure situations late in the match was a testament to her growing confidence and the confidence her teammates have in her. The 6-footer with a powerful right arm will look to continue her strong play when Pacific (11-3, 2-1 WCC) plays at 7 p.m. Thursday at Loyola Marymount (9-5, 0-2) and at 1 p.m. Saturday at Pepperdine (10-5, 1-1). “I just love when she plays like this,” said junior outside hitter Lexi Elman, who had a career-high 29 kills against USF. “It’s great. I love knowing when I’m not up there (in the front row), she’s going to get the kill anyway. It’s just great having confidence in her all the time.” LaBass has helped fill the void of departed outside Kat Schultz and opposites Anne-Sophie Bauer and Katy Tagart. LaBass has emerged as a formidable weapon opposite Elman, who as of Tuesday was second in the nation with 5.15 kills per set. Last season, LaBass had 24 kills and 20 digs and played in 24 of Pacific’s 31 matches. This season, she has played in all 14 matches and is second on the team behind Elman with 130 kills and 2.55 kills per set. LaBass also has 116 digs, third on the team behind Katrin Gotterba and Elman. “Just being on the court in a match is definitely confidence building,” LaBass said. “I have a team that builds me up every time I get a kill. They’re always letting me know ‘good job.’ Just being on the court with the team is a confidence building experience.” Pacific coach Greg Gibbons said LaBass embodies the gritty attitude that has been the team’s trademark quality this season. “She’s finding a rhythm,” Gibbons said prior to Pacific’s match on Sept. 18 at Stanford. “She’s a fighter. She’s a bull. She’s had (volunteer assistant) Jim (Polster) and I riding her a little bit and she’s taken the challenge. Her passing has gone up significantly and she’s getting in a great rhythm with (setter) Kimmy (Whitson).” The Tigers have a hungry opponent on their hands. Loyola Marymount lost in four games Tuesday at BYU and in five games last Saturday at Pepperdine. LMU had won its previous six matches after splitting its first six. The Lions are led by senior setter Hannah Tedrow and 6-foot-2 junior outside hitter Jamie Lea, who had 19 kills Tuesday against the Cougars. — Contact sports editor Bob Highfill at (209) 546-8282 or bhighfill@recordnet.com.
