He does accrue much of his yardage purely on natural ability. \nHowever, his offensive line is a big reason as to his success in the early goings of this season.

SEC Offensive Line Player of the Week: VADAL ALEXANDER. #SECHonors (need we say more?) pic.twitter.com/MNofjhWQxf â€” SEC Sports (@SEC) October 19, 2015 \nLSU's senior leader was recognized as the SEC offensive line Player of the Week.

Alexander in particular was punishing, as he utilized his long arms and considerable bulk to make life miserable for Florida defensive linemen. \nAlexander's prowess along the offensive line directly correlates with LSU's ability to run the ball effectively. It also helps to account for LSU's perfect 6-0 record thus far in 2015. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
