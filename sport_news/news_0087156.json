Instead of charging blindly upfield into waiting defenders, he waited for his blocks to develop … with that textbook stutter-step. \n73 yards later, after showing off his speed, he was in the end zone for the fifth consecutive unanswered TD by the Green Knights, thanks to that stutter-step that froze the defense and allowed the holes to open up. \nIt’s not a maneuver seen much in football any more, and to see it done so well warms the hearts of old-time gridiron fans -- but it still works. \n“Logan’s a really patient runner,” Pen Argyl coach Paul Reduzzi said. “He was great power and that burst of speed when he needs it.” \nSterner said the running emphasis was the game plan all along. \n“All we worked on all week was our running game,” Sterner said. “We knew we needed to have a great game running this week and we wanted to run the ball right at Wilson. We really wanted this game, and we went out and played the way we wanted to.” \nSterner has more than speed and that stutter-step. He sees the field well, has almost an empathic relationship with his blockers, and has the shifty kind of hips that drive defenders bonkers. And once he slips by a tackler, then comes that burst. \nAnd he can throw the ball, too, as his 61-yard TD pass to James Klinger on an option toss showed. \nSterner delighted the Homecoming crowd, to be sure. \nAnd he delighted somebody very special, too. After the players had left the Pen Argyl locker room all smiling, Reduzzi explained why he felt so good for Sterner. \n“Logan’s mom has been having some health problems, and it’s been tough for his family,” the Pen Argyl coach said. “But she was able to be here today and see him do what he did today. It was important that she was here and Logan responded to it.” \nHard to imagine a better response – or a better stutter-step – from Logan Sterner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:16:31.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
