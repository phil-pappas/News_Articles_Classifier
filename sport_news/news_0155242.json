Mariota led all rookies with 833 yards passing, eight touchdowns and a passer rating of 109.2 He tied Mark Rypien for the most TDs by any player in his first three NFL games. \nHe also was the first rookie in NFL history to post a perfect passer rating on the opening weekend in a 42-14 win at Tampa Bay. \nDarby, a second-round pick out of Florida State, is tied for the NFL lead with two interceptions. He also led all players with eight passes defensed. Buffalo won both games where Darby intercepted a pass, and his first came in the first quarter of his NFL debut. He started all three games in September and became the first Bills defensive back with at least two interceptions in a season since Jairus Byrd (nine) and Cary Harris (two) in 2009. \nThe rookie joins Leodis McKelvin as the only Bills cornerbacks to be named defensive rookie of the month. McKelvin earned the honor in November 2008. \nThis is the third straight season a Bills rookie has been named rookie of the month. Wide receiver Sammy Watkins won the offensive rookie award in October 2014 and linebacker Kiko Alonso was the defensive rookie in September 2013. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
