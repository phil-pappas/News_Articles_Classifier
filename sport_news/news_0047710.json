As the teams warmed up before the game, the Ludlowe players didn’t give the Cup a second look as they ran on and off the field. But the Warde players … they stared at it, long and hard, as they came off. \nThe trophy, first awarded by the Swedish Athletic Club in 1961, has been in the hands of the Falcons for the last decade. And based on the fact that Ludlowe, the defending FCIAC champion, had a ton of players back this season, the Cup was expected to stay with the Falcons. And it did, barely. \nThe up-and-coming Mustangs gave the experienced-laden Falcons everything they wanted, and more, over the course of 80 adrenaline-filled minutes, as the two teams battled to a 0-0 tie at Tetreau-Davis Field . \n“This game was back and forth. We had momentum, they had momentum. They’re a good team,” Ludlowe head coach Kevin O’Hara said of Warde. “Warde’s had a great season. They’re a young team and honestly, I thought next year would be their year, but obviously the record that they have, the teams that they’ve beaten, I see why they have the record they do.” \nThe tie left the Mustangs at 7-2-4 and allowed them to maintain their first place standing in the FCIAC East, one point ahead of the Falcons (7-2-3). \n“I thought we left everything on the pitch,” Mustangs head coach Justin Ottavio said. “It could have gone both ways. We both had opportunities. I think that speaks volumes for both defenses. Both sides were well-organized, disciplined and assertive. I thought it ended fairly. Unfortunately, I would have liked it to end another way but, in the end, it probably was the fairest way for it to end.” \nBoth sides had opportunities to score throughout the game but both sides were victimized by their over-aggressiveness and offensive plays were quickly countered by defensive reversals. \n“For an atmosphere like this, to play in front of this type of crowd, it was a great environment and they were jacked up,” O’Hara said. “A lot of times emotions take over instead of settling in and playing. You saw that from both teams.” \n“It’s the big inter-town rivalry and everyone wants to do whatever they can to win,” Ottavio added. “I thought we were pretty dangerous but I have to give a lot of credit to their defense. They stopped our attack multiple times and I have to give credit to our offense, we were very persistent going forward. It was an entertaining game.” \nWith just over three minutes to play, Ludlowe’s Tulio Almedia pounded a shot from 25 yards out on the right side of the field that seemed destined to find the upper left-hand corner of the net. But Mustangs goalkeeper Matt Skelton dove headlong and caught it, preserving the shutout. \n“He’s got a lot of ability and can read the game well,” Ottavio said. “I’m glad he was there to save it.” \n“The goalie made a great save,” said O’Hara. “If he doesn’t get that one, it’s dipping in under the crossbar for sure.” \nThis marks the 11th straight year that the Falcons will maintain possession of the Swedish Cup. \n“The tie gets to keep it,” O’Hara said. “I’m sure the boys will enjoy getting to hold onto it another year. I know this senior class didn’t want to be the one that lost it. To retain it for another year is great.” \nLUDLOWE 0, WARDE 0 \nLUDLOWE 0 0—0 \nWARDE 0 0—0 \nRecords: Warde 7-2-4, Ludlowe 7-2-3.
