Denver coach Gary Kubiak isn't one of those people.\n\"No,\" Kubiak told reporters Tuesday. \"Peyton is doing just fine.\"\nManning has thrown seven interceptions and six touchdown passes, one of handful of starting quarterbacks who have thrown more interceptions than touchdown passes. His quarterback rating of 77.3, 38th in the league and worse than Jameis Winston, Nick Foles and Kirk Cousins. The Broncos total offense is ranked 28th in the league.\nThe Broncos are unbeaten after five games, but it's been the defense, not the 39-year-old quarterback, that has carried the team to a 5-0 record.\nBroncos defense and kicker have accounted for 65 of team's 113 points this season, highest pct in NFL: DEN 57.5% SEA 49.5 KC 47.0 BAL 46.3\nâ€” Gil Brandt (@Gil_Brandt) October 13, 2015\nThe Broncos are unbeaten, but they know the defense isn't going to continue to score points at the current rate. Manning and the offense must increase its production for the Broncos to make a deep playoff run.\nManning would be more productive if the Broncos possessed a semblance of a running game. They are rushing for an average of 71.6 yards a game, 30th in the league. Defenses don't see the Broncos running game as a threat and they know Manning struggles throwing the deep ball. That's going to make it more difficult for Manning and the offense to score touchdowns.\nIf Manning continues to struggle, the calls for Osweiler will grow louder, regardless of whether the Broncos continue winning or not.\n-- Geoffrey C.
