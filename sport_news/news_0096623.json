The Huskies (5-3, 3-1) remain tied for third in the MAC West. \nOffense \nA. The Huskies piled up 591 offensive yards and went 5-for-5 in red-zone scoring chances as Joel Bouagnon scored his 14th rushing touchdown. Wide receiver Tommylee Lewis had seven catches for 80 yards and a touchdown. \nDefense \nB+. NIU shut out Eastern Michigan in the first half, then gave up 21 points in a sloppier second. Cornerback Shawun Lurry saw his interception streak (five straight games) come to an end. \nSpecial teams \nA. Christian Hagan averaged 59.7 yards on eight kickoffs and was 7-for-7 on extra points. \nCoaching \nB+. Coach Rod Carey had the Huskies ready to roll with five unanswered first-half touchdowns and just one punt the first six times they had the ball. The second half turned sloppy, to Carey's chagrin. \"We (needed to) come out with better attention to detail,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:42:23.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
