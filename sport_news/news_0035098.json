Annoyance turned into astonishment.\nBurns eventually connected with Coach K, the five-time NCAA champion and Olympic gold medal-winning coach, and almost immediately Burns heard four words that will stick with him forever.\nI'm proud of you.\nKrzyzewski's call came after the coach was interviewed by USA TODAY Sports for the exclusive story in which Burns came out as the first openly gay coach in Division I men's basketball. Bryant faces defending national champion Duke in next month's season opener.\n\"It takes a lot of courage to do what he's doing and I surely applaud him for it,\" Krzyzewski told USA TODAY Sports. \"My message to him is, first off, congratulations, I'm very proud of you. Next, please know you'll be accepted by your brothers in the sport of men's basketball. You're included now in a very strong way. I think this will be something coaches in our sport will love.\"\nOne of Burns' biggest worries about coming out has been how it could affect his chances of becoming a Division I head coach. Krzyzewski was quick to quell that concern.\n\"I don't think it will hinder him from advancing in this sport,\" Krzyzewski said. \"In fact, I think (coming out) will help. Because I think to advance, you need to be yourself and be who you are. That's just being honest. People — players and coaches — they embrace honesty. He's an amazing example for others to be honest with themselves. He'll be much more successful because he'll be himself and not trying to impersonate anyone else.\"\nKrzyzewski said he'd support a gay player on his team or a gay coach on his staff. \"This is a part of life that should be celebrated,\" he said. \"I'm glad this is happening. This is part of the solution.\n\"Sports have been helpful in so many ways in our society. In basketball, one of the best things our sport does is bring different races together. We play in shorts, people see their faces and they can see the intimacy and love for one another. With this, the sport of basketball forges another opportunity for a part of life to be embraced by everyone. It's been difficult to show that with this issue. It hasn't been as comfortable for people to be who they truly are.\"\nKrzyzewski said he expects a ripple effect in which closeted coaches will feel they can go public as well. \"For him to be the first one to make that step, it's pretty amazing,\" Krzyzewski said. \"In some respects, you wonder why this is the first.\"\nKrzyzewski drew criticism in April when he remained silent on Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act at the Final Four in Indianapolis. Krzyzewski said then that he wanted to focus on his team's quest for a title rather than on social issues. He is loud and clear on Burns.\n\"This is about being a good human being,\" Krzyzewski said. \"We should embrace this. It's a positive part of our society.\"\nAnd he offered this benediction to closeted coaches around the nation, in all sports.\n\"We don't just accept you,\" he said. \"We embrace you and we love you.\"\n***\nFollow college basketball reporter/digital editor Scott Gleeson on Twitter @ScottMGleeson .
