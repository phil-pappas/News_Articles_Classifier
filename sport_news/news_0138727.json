First, Konoplyanka's clever free kick from a crossing position hit Joe Hart's left post, before the England goalkeeper was forced into a fine save from Grzegorz Krychowiak's low effort down to his left. \nYaya Toure's deflected effort landed fortuitously on top of Sergio Rico's net as City came close to an opener, but Sevilla were ahead shortly after. \nSome poor defending from the hosts allowed Victor Vitolo to get beyond Eliaquim Mangala on the right, before his centre was turned home by the waiting Konoplyanka. \nToure burst to life six minutes later to bring City level, easing his way past Timothee Kolodziejczak at the right byline to cross for Raheem Sterling, whose effort was saved before Bony reacted first to turn the ball onto Rami's shin and into the net. \nSevilla nearly went in at half-time ahead when Vitolo's cross found striker Kevin Gameiro, but his header went over the bar with just Hart to beat. \nAfter the break, Gameiro again had a fine opportunity to hand Sevilla their second, but once more headed over the bar unmarked from six yards. \nSubstitute Michael Krohn-Dehli slammed an effort into the side-netting with 15 minutes remaining as Sevilla kept pushing, but it was the hosts who grabbed the win in stoppage time. \nBreaking after a Sevilla attack, Toure fed De Bruyne on the right wing, before the Belgian edged into the right side of the box unchallenged and hit an unstoppable drive into the bottom left corner past Rico. \nCity are now in a good position to qualify from Group D, sitting three points above Sevilla, but they face their beaten opponents next up in Spain.
