For the second straight year, the Wildcats had a practice, which doubled as an on-campus combine for pro scouts, televised live.\nIn front of a national audience and representatives of all 30 NBA teams – about 85 total scouts told UK they planned to attend – the 2015-16 Cats went through agility testing and shooting drills, then 3-on-3, 4-on-4 and 5-on-5 scrimmaging Sunday night.\n\"They are working harder and jumping higher and running faster than they do at practice,\" coach John Calipari said on the broadcast. \"Maybe I should have pro scouts at more practices.\"\nA scout for the Dallas Mavericks told ESPN's Andy Katz that the combine is \"very beneficial\" for NBA franchises \"because we like to see them in this environment and how they adapt to all the pressure. Does the pressure bother them? Is there a fear factor?\" The scout added that \"Kentucky did a great job here.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK's Willis, aiming for bigger role, hurts finger\nThere is, of course, the added benefit of unprecedented exposure for Calipari and the Cats. The broadcast included plenty of praise for the coach and his program and Kentucky's success putting players into the pros.\nESPN's Jay Williams said he heard a lot from UK \"haters\" on social media about why the network would only do a broadcast such as this for the Wildcats.\n\"Well, let me tell you,\" he said, before reeling off the program's recent run of Final Fours and draft picks – and the fact that famous rapper Drake included Kentucky his song lyrics. \"One of the top two most-relevant programs in the country,\" he said, with his alma mater, Duke, presumably being the other.\nAs for the action and analysis – former coach Seth Greenberg and NBA analyst Doris Burke were also on the call – here are some highlights from Sunday night's session:\n» Tyler Ulis is the man: The sophomore point guard was the smoothest player on the floor. In 3-on-3, he was in total control, scored by driving and by draining jump shots, and already showed a chemistry with freshman big man Skal Labissiere. According to UK (ESPNU did not show it), Ulis hit a team-best 70 3-pointers in a five-minute drill. Williams watched Saturday's practice, too, and said Ulis was \"destroying people.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nThese Cats will go as far as Ulis takes them\nSo who'll lead this team? \"It will be Tyler Ulis,\" Greenberg said. \"He's got a hardness and a toughness about him. He's got a likability about him, so others will follow him.\" Burke said that Ulis never backs down \"gives you some credibility with teammates, because you don't blink in tough moments.\"\n» Alex Poythress making progress: He did not participate in the NBA drills for scouts, as he's not all the way back from ACL surgery last December. But he participated in all the drills and scrimmaging. The senior forward ran well, blocked a Marcus Lee shot, hit some mid-range jumpers and threw down a few dunks. He doesn't have back all of his explosiveness yet, but he looks to be on track.\nThere was a lot of talk about lateral movement, although he did OK defending the speedy Ulis on one play. Williams said he's \"still questioning whether Alex Poythress truly trusts in that left leg.\"\n» Skal Labissiere flashes potential: First things first: Katz reported that UK confirmed to him Labissiere not yet being cleared by the NCAA is \"not an academic issue; it's an amateurism issue,\" but said the delay is not abnormal, and the Cats are at this point not overly concerned. A team spokesman, however, said the school is not confirming what Katz reported, pointing to its previous statement that no student-athlete's eligibility will be commented on until the first game.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nBroken hand sidelines UK's Hawkins a month\nOn the floor, the 6-foot-11 freshman ran and jumped like an elite player – at least until he cramped up. He also showed impressive shooting range for a big man. \"He shoots it like a guard,\" Greenberg said. \"It's not where he is now. It's where he's going, because of his size, his skill, his athleticism.\" Burke noted that on Saturday, Labissiere \"made some eye-popping plays.\"\n» Jamal Murray can play: The five-star freshman guard \"can dance with the basketball,\" Williams said. \"He was dissecting people with the pick-and-roll\" in his breakout performance at the Pan-Am games this summer. \"This kid's got a chance to be a special player.\" Added Greenberg: \"He's got an old-man's game.\" Murray looked very smooth in early shooting drills Sunday.\n» Isaiah Briscoe shows good and bad: Greenberg repeatedly referred to the freshman guard's \"city game,\" his ability to create shots and make plays for himself. He did that more than once Sunday, finishing some difficult drives. He also turned it over a few times, which prompted a fair amount of discussion about his decision-making. Calipari said this summer he trusts Ulis and Murray more to freestyle at this point.\nWilliams said he noticed Briscoe had the ball coming off his pinky and ring fingers while shooting Saturday (it should come off the index finger last), but he adjusted and the shot improved. \"He's a rhythm shooter,\" Williams said. Added Greenberg: \"if he can shoot the basketball, he's an elite college guard.\" And Burke: \"He'd be an impossible check.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nWho's Kentucky basketball's class clown?\n» \"Don't forget about Marcus Lee\": That was Greenberg, talking about the springy, 6-9 junior forward. After two years as a deep reserve, \"it's going to be interesting to see how Marcus will handle the bright lights,\" Williams said. \"If he stays within himself, he can be a very special player. He doesn't need to score 20 points a night.\"\nWilliams noted that Lee simply needs to buy into running the floor hard, rebounding aggressively and protecting the rim. He did that on one lob during scrimmage action, intercepting it at the rim. He also got rejected by Poythress on a post-up move on the other end.\n» Isaac Humphries can help: The 7-foot freshman from Australia was impressive offensively. He swished several deep jumpers, including one on a nice pick-and-pop with Briscoe. Soon after, he drained a baseline jumper during scrimmage action.\nWilliams might've gone overboard saying \"he could be a No. 1 pick in a couple years,\" but Humphries is a really skilled big man. Calipari told the broadcast crew that \"Isaac needs to be on the floor some.\"\n» Other notables: Freshman wing Charles Matthews looked aggressive on defense and very explosive as a finisher. He nearly threw down a crazy dunk on Humphries. Burke said Matthews and Murray were most active in Saturday's practice. \"You need guys like that on the floor,\" Greenberg said.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nReloaded UK basketball aims to finish job\nJunior-college transfer Mychal Mulder didn't get much screen time or draw much chatter, but Williams noted that almost all of UK's 3-point shooters from last year are gone and that's what he is known for. \"Dead-eye shooter,\" Williams said. \"He'll need to do that.\"\n» The bottom line: ESPNU signed off with some big-picture analysis of the Cats, who have six new players and lost seven from last season's 38-1 team. Williams believes there's Final Four – but maybe not national title – potential for UK. \"They have a chance to really grow into something special,\" adding that Ulis and Murray are most important and Poythress and Lee are the X-factors. \"It looks like a team that has new pieces,\" Greenberg said. \"It looks like a team that only has had six practices. But this team has unbelievable potential, because … the game starts with guards,\" and UK has great ones.\nKyle Tucker can be reached at (502) 582-4361.
