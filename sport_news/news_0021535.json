The MIAA released its playoff brackets on Sunday and five local squads – Nantucket, Falmouth, Mashpee, Dennis-Yarmouth and St. John Paul II – will begin gearing up for a march to Gillette Stadium in pursuit of a state championship. The Nantucket Whalers (7-0, 6-0), Mayflower Athletic Conference Small champions, highlight the Cape and Islands field, earning the second seed in the Div. 6 South Sectional and a home game. Nantucket begins postseason play with a Mayflower League crossover game against No. 7 Blue Hills (5-2) at 5 p.m. on Friday. Joining Nantucket in the Div. 6 South bracket is Mashpee (5-2) and St. John Paul II (4-3), with the No. 6 and 8 seeds, respectively. By finishing second in the South Shore League Small, the Falcons claimed the league’s second automatic qualifying bid and will open the playoffs on the road at No. 3 Bishop Connolly (7-0) of the Mayflower Large. Bishop Connolly hosts Mashpee on Friday at 7 p.m. in Fall River. St. John Paul II went into the final weekend on the outside looking in, but the Lions played their way into the postseason with Saturday night’s win over league foe Matignon/St. Joseph’s. St. John Paul II (4-1 CC) finished in a three-way tie atop the Catholic Central Small, but via a tiebreak secured the league’s automatic qualifying bid and the No. 8 seed in the Div. 6 South. The Lions have a tall task ahead in top-seeded Cohasset, which hosts the Lions at 7 p.m. Friday. The Skippers, the reigning Div. 6 champs, defeated the Lions 24-0 on Oct. 9. With this past weekend’s victory over Falmouth to claim Atlantic Coast League runner-up, Dennis Yarmouth (4-2, 3-1) wrapped up its third consecutive appearance in the Div. 4 South, where the Dolphins sneak in as the No. 7 seed. The Dolphins won a game from the seven-spot last season and will look to continue their good fortunes against second-seeded Foxboro, a team they lost to last season in a late-round consolation game. They play Friday at Foxboro-Ahern Middle School at 7 p.m. Falmouth let a chance to clinch the top-seed in the Div. 3 Southeast slips through its grasp with the loss to D-Y. As a result, the Clippers (5-2, 2-2 ACL) fall to the No. 4 seed. However, they earn an all-important first-round home game as Falmouth opens with with No. 5 Somerset Berkley of the Eastern Athletic Conference on Friday at 7 p.m. Two teams – Sandwich and Upper Cape Tech – held playoff positions entering the final weekend, but were bumped. Despite finishing the season with a higher “power score” than St. John Paul in the Div. 6 South, the Lions advanced over the Rams because of the automatic qualifying bid. Sandwich is on the outside looking in after Sharon’s upset victory over Canton to steal the last spot in Div. 3 Southeast. The eight local non-playoff teams will be paired up against other non-playoff teams from their respective divisions for the final three weeks of the season, beginning this weekend as well.
