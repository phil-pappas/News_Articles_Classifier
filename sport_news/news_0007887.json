Neither side was troubled, and neither 'keeper had a save to make. \nThe best chances of the half fell to Yaya Toure, whose looping header from a corner went just wide, and who spooned a shot inside the box after a great pass from Kevin De Bruyne. In the second half, United should have had a penalty when Raheem Sterling tripped Ander Herrera, and from the corner awarded Chris Smalling headed just wide. \nThere were similarly few chances in the second half, and Anthony Martial almost set up the winner when Jesse Lingard forced Joe Hart into tipping a shot onto the bar, and Chris Smalling almost squeezed in a shot at the near post. \nCity appeared to come for the draw, and that saw them return to the top of the table. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
