Pic/ PTI \n\"The talks have not been called off. Mr Manohar and Mr Khan will speak to each other in evening today and tomorrow they are coming to Delhi for another round of talks,\" IPL Chairman and senior Board functionary Rajiv Shukla told PTI. \n\"In no way, the dialogue will be stopped. BCCI has never compromised with national interests,\" he said. \nIn tomorrow's meeting, Shukla and BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur will also be present. The PCB chairman is also expected to meet top government officials. Manohar had invited Khan for talks on the much-awaited series scheduled in December. \nKhan and PCB's executive committee head Najam Sethi are in the city for the meeting after discussing the planned series with BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur earlier on the sidelines of the ICC meeting in Dubai. \nThakur had assured him a final decision could be taken later this month and conveyed Manohar's invitation to visit India. \nThere is speculation that the two neighbours could play either a bilateral series in the UAE or agree to a possible triangular series in December also involving Bangladesh.
