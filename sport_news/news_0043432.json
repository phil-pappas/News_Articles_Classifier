The Panthers will be back in action on Saturday at the MPCHS home tournament. \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nThe Mt. Pleasant volleyball team played their last game before this weekend’s home tournament on Tuesday night. The Panthers had their hands full with 10th-ranked Fairfield. The Trojans played above the net all night and were able to pick up the road sweep over the Panthers, 25-11, 25-18 and 25-14. \nThe Trojans worked the ball to junior hitter Shelby Heston all night. She had 16 of the team’s 40 kills on 31 attack attempts, and setter Kelsey Roberts was able to find her early in the match. \nMt. Pleasant hung with Fairfield early in the first set, even taking a 4-1 lead early, but a big run midway through the set put the Trojans in the lead, 20-10. Behind a solid hitting game, the Trojans were able to go on a 5-1 run to finish off the first set, 25-11. \nIn the second set, Fairfield exploded behind a big serve streak by Mackenzie Flattery. Flattery ran the score up to 10-0 in the second before the streak was ended by a Julie Lasswell kill for Mt. Pleasant. \n“I thought we served particularly well,” said Trojan head coach Nancy Diers about the game. “We had some misses but we were serving really aggressively and ended up with eight aces.” \nThe Panthers outscored the Trojans for the rest of the second set, but they had a big mountain to climb. Still, setter Ashlee Menke was able to put her hitters in good positions. Lasswell and Danielle Coffin got things rolling from the outside hitter position, and Abbie Liechty had a big serve streak late in the game, but the Trojans were able to get by with a 25-18 win. \n“Our best defense is running an offense,” said Mt. Pleasant coach Dave Streeter after the game. “When we’re not able to run an offense, it makes it tough for us.” \nMt. Pleasant got off to a good start in the third set. Once again, it was Lasswell who sparked the Panthers with a kill to open up the game. The two teams went back and forth for most of the set, and Fairfield held a slim 13-8 lead midway through the game. The Trojans, however, went on a 12-6 run to finish off the game to win their eighth game in a row and stay unbeaten in the conference. \nAfter the game, Streeter said he saw some improvements from the last time the two teams met, but said the power hitters up front for Fairfield were just too much. \n“We made adjustments on the block, but with the hitters they have they were able to go around us and move the ball around and we just weren’t able to keep up with them.” \nThe Panthers fell to 8-17 overall and 3-3 in conference. After the home tournament this weekend, Mt. Pleasant will host Ft. Madison (Oct. 13) and travel to Keokuk (Oct. 22) to close out the season. In the regional tournament, Mt. Pleasant will compete in Class 4A Region 8 where they will host Keokuk in the first round, on Oct. 26, for the chance to play at Ft. Madison on Oct. 29, in the semi-finals. \nFairfield moved to 23-2 overall and 5-0 in SEC play. The Trojans have three conference games left. They’ll host Washington on Oct. 13, travel to Keokuk on Oct. 20, and close out the season with Ft. Madison at home on Oct. 22. The Trojans will receive a bye into the Class 4A Region 4 semi-finals where they will host the winner of the Oskaloosa vs. Knoxville game on Oct. 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:57:21.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
