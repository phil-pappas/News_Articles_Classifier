Left tackle Gokhan Ozkan and guard Winston Hill, who combine to form the Falcons' 645-pound package of blocking bliss, always seem to know what the other is thinking.\n\"I could say, 'Winston,' and he'll say, 'yeah,'\" and we won't have to say anything else because we already know what each other is thinking,\" Ozkan said about his chemistry with Hill. \"On the field, in the lunchroom, all the time cracking jokes ... we're always on point.\"\nAdded Hill, \"We're like brothers.\"\nHill and Ozkan stand side by side as teammates on the O-line, and off the field as best friends. The solidarity has paved the way for more than 1,600 yards rushing by Bishop Ford running backs Willis Dendy and Timmy Robinson, and that will be a vital component if the Falcons are going to do what they failed to last season: play for the CHSFL 'A' championship.\nThe Falcons suffered their second straight loss last Saturday, falling 29-12 to St. Peter's on Staten Island. Before looking ahead to the playoffs, Ford (3-4; 3-3 league) will meet Nazareth in the season finale on Saturday at Midwood.\nAn experiment by Bishop Ford coach Jim Esposito to start Dendy at quarterback resulted in a 31-0 loss to Kellenberg in the season opener; after that, the bruising rusher returned to the backfield. There, he and Robinson helped the Falcons to win three of their next six games, running through the Grand Canyon-size holes that Hill and Ozkan have been excavating.\nThe dominating linemen say they've learned to tailor their blocking tactics to each back. Dendy is a move-the-pile punisher; Robinson is an elusive speedster.\n\"Willis doesn't stop, so neither can we,\" said Ozkan, who stands 6-7 and weighs 295 pounds.\n\"For Dendy, he's powerful, so we have to know to push him far,\" added the 6-4, 350-pound Hill. \"For Timmy, we have to get him in an area that he can stretch (the field). Our blocks have to be on, so when he stretches no one touches him.\"\nWhile Dendy and Robinson receive accolades for all their yardage and touchdowns, Hill and Ozkan quietly go about their business, which is typical of offensive linemen.\n\"You'll find that the O-line doesn't get the credit they deserve sometimes and are overlooked,\" said Esposito, who played OT for Albany State and still shows his old game tapes to his anchors. \"These guys are doing great for us this year.\"\nOzkan, in particular, seems to relish watching Esposito in action.\n\"Coach was more of the finesse guy that knew how to move people and he was powerful, too,\" Ozkan said of Esposito's style as a lineman in college. \"I'm trying to be his apprentice.\"\nOzkan, a senior, said he has already received an offer from Buffalo, while junior Hill said he's received letters of interest from Georgia Tech, Syracuse and Wisconsin.\nFord's line didn't help Dendy bust into the end zone in last season's playoff semifinal loss to Spellman, but the big guys grounded the Falcons from the Bronx in the grudge match on Oct. 6.\nHill and Ozkan helped pave the way for Dendy to rack up 216 yards, two touchdowns and a pair of two-point conversions as Ford defeated Spellman, 22-0. Robinson added 129 yards and a touchdown on the ground in the victory.\nIf the Falcons are going to reach new heights this postseason, Hill and Ozkan will need to continue dominating the line.\n\"When you have someone like Winston, you know the backs are going to get through,\" Ozkan said.\n\"We trust each other and work hard,\" Hill added. \"We want to finish strong.\"\nBrooklyn Notebook:\nChiefs pass go\nFrom the season's outset, Canarsie has been establishing the run with punishing running back Brandon Jones. In pulling out a 22-18 victory over Sheepshead Bay last weekend, the Chiefs proved that they're also capable of airing it out, especially when their backs are to the wall.\nTrailing 18-2 at the end of the third quarter, Canarsie found itself unable to mount any type of offense. Quarterback Sha-Tim Pratt threw three passes into Deandre Hall's chest, but the receiver dropped them all.\nCanarsie coach Mike Camardese had the confidence to keep calling plays for Hall, and the senior rewarded his faith. Hall pulled down two TD receptions in the fourth quarter and the Chiefs completed their comeback, winning 22-18.\nThe victory boosted the Chiefs into second place in the City Championship/Bowl Division standings, just under Curtis. Afterward, the Chiefs peppered Hall with a sarcastic \"Deandre (stinks)\" chant.\n\"They're saying that because I talk a lot during practice,\" Hall said. \"With playoff time coming around, I know they're never going to lose faith in me. I know I come through in clutch moments.\"\nBoys higher\nBoys & Girls started the season 0-5, but the Kangaroos have won two straight games, including their 28-14 victory over Midwood last Saturday. Boys RB Travis Panton rushed for 166 yards and two TDs on 22 carries to lead the Kangaroos to the win. Last season, Midwood defeated Boys with a 43-yard field goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:47:59.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
