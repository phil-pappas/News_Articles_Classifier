Pele \nWhile the five-star hotel was not available for a reaction, it is learnt that Pele may also have his favourite staple - rice and beans. \nDutta, who accompanied the Brazilian legend to the hotel in a SUV, said Pele was surprised to see a \"sea change\" in the city. \n\"It looked completely transformed to him. He also inquired about a few words like 'thank you and hello' in the local language so that he can greet the chief minister Mamata Banerjee when he meets her at the Netaji Indoor Stadium tomorrow.\" \nPele also caught with on the local newspapers and inquired about the ongoing Indian Super League football tournament. \n\"He was surprised to know that it's only played for two months... 'Why in such a short duration' he asked,\" Dutta added. \nComing from a 24-plus-hour travel from Sao Paulo via Dubai, the 74-year-old who landed in the city this morning along with his three assistants, chose to take rest in the fourth floor of his Presidential Suite to beat the jetlag. \n\"No one is allowed to meet him today. He's taking complete rest,\" Dutta said. \nPele has a hectic schedule beginning tomorrow which will begin with an interaction with media, followed by students of NSHM Knowledge Campus. \nIn the evening, Pele will walk down the memory lane at Eden Gardens where his team New York Cosmos played out a 2-2 draw in the exhibition match against local powerhouse Mohun Bagan in 1977. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:00:44.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
