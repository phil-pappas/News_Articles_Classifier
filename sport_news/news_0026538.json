Security guards laughed in happy futility.\nAnthony Miller, the walk-on receiver, decided to do a lap around the entire inside of the Liberty Bowl, and never mind that he couldn't see clearly because of the tears.\n\"I just broke down,\" he said. \"The nation should take notice of us now.\"\nThe nation will. The nation already has. A nationally televised 37-24 victory over No. 13 Ole Miss will do that for a city and a team.\n\"It's historic,\" said Rudd.\n\"It means everything,\" said Memphis athletic director Tom Bowen.\nIt means the Tigers will be ranked in both polls, will have a chance to stretch their winning streak to 14 games and beyond, and are one of the favorites to play in a New Year's Eve bowl game.\nBut that's getting ahead of ourselves. Let's begin at the beginning, which, for present purposes, shall be considered the ceremony early Saturday morning to take the wraps off the Liberty Bowl's new \"John 'Bull' Bramlett Lane.\"\nBramlett loved playing against Ole Miss. He died six days shy of a year ago.\n\"We're going to win,\" said Nancy Bramlett, John's widow. \"It's going to be icing on the cake. John is watching and we are going to win.\"\nOK, but John may have gotten a little nervous when Memphis went down 14-zip, along with most of the 60,241 fans.\nBut the players?\nThe players left nervous behind somewhere between BYU, Bowling Green and Cincinnati.\n\"Coach (Rohrk) Cutchlow told us before the game 'Your best can ride with anyone,' \" said Memphis tight end Alan Cross.\nLet the record show their best is better than Ole Miss.\nThat's right, better. Just better. There was nothing fluky or accidental about this win.\nMemphis outgained Ole Miss, 491-480. Memphis had more first downs, 31-25. Memphis dominated the time of possession, 37:20-22:32.\nAnd when the game was in the balance, it wasn't the upstart team from the American Athletic Conference that tried to get by on too-clever sleight of hand, it was the big, bad team from the SEC.\nTo wit: Early in the second quarter, leading 14-7, Ole Miss faced a third-and-one from the Memphis 10.\nOle Miss coach Hugh Freeze decided to hand the ball to Robert Nkemdiche, his five-star, all-world defensive lineman. Nkemdiche got stuffed and left the game for good.\nBramlett would have loved that moment. He would have reveled in what happened next. Because the Nkemdiche play was the clear turning point, the moment when his Memphis Tigers took charge.\nOn its next five possessions, Ole Miss ran a total of 14 plays for 11 yards.\nOn its next five possessions, Memphis scored three touchdowns and a field goal.\n\"Tigers are on an absolute tear,\" tweeted ESPN. Over on Twitter, the word \"Memphis\" started trending worldwide.\nThis was the day unfolding just as every Memphis fan had dreamed it might unfold. This was the perfect portrait of what Memphis football has become.\nThe previously maligned defense rose up to hold Ole Miss to 1.7 yards a carry. The lightly recruited quarterback looked like the best player — for either team — on the field. Someone asked Freeze how the Memphis receivers were able to get so open.\n\"A lot of that has to do with their quarterback,\" he said. \"He's one of the best quarterbacks I've seen.\"\nLynch completed 39 of 53 passes for 384 yards and three touchdowns. Three former walk-ons — Miller, Alan Cross and Mose Frazier — caught 24 of those passes for 256 yards and all three scores.\nMeanwhile, in the stands, the Vanilla Gorilla played his air guitar, longtime sufferers snapped photos as evidence that all this was really happening, and the massive crowd broke into an impromptu wave.\nWho would have imagined that on the day Justin Timberlake was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, he would be the second-most celebrated Justin in the city? Who would have believed that a party featuring Timberlake, Jimmy Fallon and Keith Richards would be the second-most joyous party of the night?\nThe game turned into a countdown. Rudd assured a reporter he had already found a booster to pay for new goal posts. Except, it turns out, Memphis won't even need new goal posts. Destroying Ole Miss was evidently enough.\nInstead, it was all happiness. All selfies and tears and high-fives. Fuente doffed his cap as he walked off the field and into the tunnel. Lynch bounced and danced in a student mob.\n\"I got hit harder in the pile than I did in the game,\" said Lynch. \"Like nothing I've experienced in my life.\"\nSo now come the updated polls and the updated expectations. Now comes the chance to turn this moment into something more. Indeed, that's what separates this memorable Tiger win from nearly all of the memorable Tiger wins that preceded it. This one is about more than the final score.\nIt's about a program that is changing its trajectory and maybe its destiny. It's about what has happened and what might happen still.\n\"The city's got our back and we've got their back,\" said Cross. \"No telling where that can lead.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*146/1018_MASP_umfb21.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/spacer.gif"], "published": "2015-10-18T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:10:31.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
