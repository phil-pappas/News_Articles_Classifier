All I know is that I will need to work hard in order to bounce back. At Chelsea we have concerns both as a team and individually,\" the 24-year-old winger added.\nHazard admitted his poor performances meant he was no longer \"untouchable\" as one of the first names on Mourinho's team sheet, but praised the Portuguese and backed himself to bounce back when the league resumes on October 17 after the international break.\n\"I was left on the bench against Porto in the Champions League, and I am no longer immune to being left out. You can be untouchable when you play well, and that has not been the case with me,\" Hazard said.\n\"I think the manager wanted to send me a message by making me a sub. I don't read everything he says, but he explains everything.\n\"I am not too worried for him â€“ Mourinho is the best coach in the world when it comes to dealing with pressure. I am an optimist, and I know I can learn a lot from tough spells.\n\"I hope to come back stronger, and I am ready to play and do my best,\" he added.\n(For .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:35:09.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
