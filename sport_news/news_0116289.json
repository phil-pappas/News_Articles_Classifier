His performance that day was part regular season, part playoffs, why you get excited about Price and how he can frustrate. He was as sharp as he has been in any Blue Jays start, giving up a leadoff single to Alcides Escobar, the playoff hitting machine, and then retiring the next 18 batters with the help of great stuff and the shadows from a late afternoon start. \nHe was dominant and strong and looking to make the kind of impression Price needs to make — not for his finances, he’s getting a big deal no matter what happens in this series — but because he needs to know he can be a playoff difference-maker. \nThen his old teammate, Ben Zobrist, faced him in the seventh inning and blooped a high fly ball to the place between second base and right field. Everyone knows what happened. Ryan Goins called off Jose Bautista and when Goins inexplicably slid down on the play, the ball fell between them. \nPrice came apart from that moment on. \nGibbons had seen him pitch out of trouble before. He gave him the opportunity to do so again, surprising, considering the circumstances. The Jays and Price never recovered. Price said it didn’t bother him: The evidence is to the contrary. \nNow there’s a well known American columnist, Jeff Passan, one of the better sportswriters in America, who has written a strongly worded column indicating that Price has been abused and misused by the Jays, compared him to a puppet and the club to playing the part of puppet master. His thesis is interesting, pointed, if not flawed. \nThe Jays made a sound decision in Round 1, determining that Marcus Stroman was the better choice to pitch Game 5 than Price. Once they did that, if they were playing pitch to pitch, Price had to go to the bullpen. Apparently, he was fine with that. \nThe other night, with elimination possible, Price warmed up in the bullpen. Passan sees that as insulting for a great star. The Jays see this as pitching pragmatism. This is a rental player. They don’t need to worry about the future. They don’t need to worry about hurt feelings. \nIt’s a lot like driving a rental car. It’s not your own. You don’t treat it the same way. You can be a little less cautious, if that’s the right word, because the odds are strong that Price’s last start as a Blue Jay comes tonight — if they don’t’ make the World Series. \nIf he doesn’t win, he becomes the most supreme playoff loser in history: Randy Johnson lost a pile of games in a row — but he also won a World Series MVP and had a 7-9 win-loss record in the post-season. The first number for Price’s record as a playoff starter is zero. \nIt needs to be a one Friday night for him to make another Blue Jays start. \nThe Blue Jays have faced elimination this post-season four times and have won all four of those games. Price, the equivalent of the opening day starter for the Jays, faces Yordano Ventura, who did start for K.C. on opening day in a game that can’t really be properly handicapped. \nIn Toronto, there is fear that Price can’t get it together when it matters most yet there is optimism that this is the perfect time for him to be great. One emotion with the other. In Kansas City, there is fear if the Royals don’t win Friday night, the odds are they won’t win Saturday with Marcus Stroman pitching against Johnny Cueto. \nBut it’s the Jays with little wiggle room. Up against it once again. Hanging on the ropes. Facing elimination. Fighting back, the only way they know. \nOf all that has been odd, sensational and slightly unexplainable about this Blue Jays playoff season, the discrepancy in the scores in the ALCS has been weirdly revealing. There have been no real close games in the series. The Jays have won 7-1 and 11-8 and lost 14-2. They’ve won 6-3 and lost 5-0. This is the first time since Boston clobbered Cleveland in the 2007 ALCS that there hasn’t been a one-run game. In the games they won, Toronto scored 18 runs. In their losses in this series, they’ve scored just five runs. Unlike Price, the more pressure on the Jays, the better they have been. \nIn six post-season games that couldn’t have eliminated the Jays, they have a 1-5 record. \nIn the four games where it was lose or go home, the Jays are 4-0. \nNow they have to be in sync, this team and this pitcher who went out and bought scooters and robes and paid for dinners and got excited like a little kid and brought everybody closer together for this short time. \nThis is about him. This is about Toronto. This is about an opportunity that is here in the city, the country, this franchise. \nNed Yost, the Kansas City manager, does not expect a gimme from David Price. “He’s a guy that’s in the top five in the voting for the Cy Young,” said Yost. “He’s a tough matchup. We’re just going to have to hope that we can take advantage of mistakes, if he makes any, and keep battling.” \nHe’s talking about his team. He could be talking about David Price. If this is his going to be goodbye to the Blue Jays, the goodbye needs to be delayed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:21:14.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
