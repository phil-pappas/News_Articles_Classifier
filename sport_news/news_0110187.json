He's an important player at Werder and is looking forward to the game,\" Skripnik told the club's website. \nMeanwhile, Ujah who took his Bundesliga goal tally to four at the weekend admitted that they overcame the pressure at the Coface Arena against FSV Mainz. \n\"Back to winning ways. Let's keep fighting boys. Our away fans were great and loud. \n\"We have been under a lot of pressure in the last few weeks, but we have overcome it. \n\"It was an amazing feeling, especially as the Mainz fans applauded me. But we have to look forward and concentrate on the upcoming important matches,\" he told his club's official website. \nThe encounter will see the Werder players wear a new kit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:10:45.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
