The three most prominent parts to that passing attack are former Dallas-area high school stars.\nCorey Coleman, the former Richardson Pearce running back/receiver/do-everything, is this week's Big 12 co-Offensive Player of the Week after catching six passes for 182 yards and 4 TDs in the win over Lamar. For the season, he has 11 catches for 360 yards (32.7 yards per catch) and 5 touchdowns.\nAs a senior at Pearce in 2011, Coleman caught 69 passes for 932 yards and 11 TDs. He also rushed 82 times for 551 yards and 15 scores. In addition to football, he starred at Pearce in basketball and track, and before his senior year, he ran the fastest 40-yard dash time at a combine in Oregon featuring some of the nation's top recruits.\nBaylor's other top receiver is Jay Lee, who we at SportsDay referred to by his given name, Jonathon Lee, when he was at Allen. (He went by Jay on campus, but was always Jonathon on the rosters.) Lee caught 38 passes for 708 yards and 8 TDs as a senior at Allen in 2010, and is now the only senior receiver for Baylor. He has 12 catches in two games for 181 yards and 3 touchdowns.\nYou can read more about him in this story , where he talks about being a senior:\n\"It is my senior year, so I've got to go out with a bang. Just knowing this offense and where and when to be at the right time and just being a veteran, it's in the air for us.\"\nThe starting quarterback for Baylor is Seth Russell, who played for Garland. He didn't put up spectacular numbers as a senior in 2011 (1,502 passing yards, 12 TDs, plus 471 yards rushing and 7 TDs), but recruiters saw the potential. At Baylor this season, his first as full-time starter after backing up Bryce Petty, he has completed 38 of 64 passes for 718 yards and 9 touchdowns -- with 4 interceptions.\nBaylor coach Art Briles has called Russell \"a tremendous upside guy.\"\nBaylor next plays Rice on Sept. 26, and the Bears begin Big 12 Conference play on Oct. 3 at home against Texas Tech.\nFollow @mattwixon\nOn Twitter:\n @mattwixon", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/mattwixon", "https://twitter.com/mattwixon"], "published": "2015-09-15T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:49:27.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
