A thrilling comeback win over Washington — the Falcons have made a habit of those — gave them sole possession of the NFC South lead because Carolina (4-0) was idle.\n\"We're not going to let anyone else dictate our readiness,\" said Quinn as he looked at a short week to prepare for New Orleans. \"How we play, how we approach each week. We're always prepared to go as long as we to have to. They just won't stop backing off and competing.\"\nAtlanta (No. 5 in AP Pro32) is a 3-point choice over No. 27 New Orleans, which comes off a pedestrian performance in a loss at Philadelphia. The Saints (1-4) can't run the ball or stop the run and only winless Detroit has more giveaways in the NFC.\n\"You just focus strictly on the game ahead,\" Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan said. \"That's something that's proven to help us and I'm hoping to do the same this year.\"\nNope.\nFALCONS, 31-21\n___\nKNOCKOUT LEAGUE TIP:\nWhen we have a survivor, it's by the skin of the pigskin.
