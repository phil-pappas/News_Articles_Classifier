Arizona Diamondbacks wary of expensive ace additions \nByrnes knows a lot about this subject, but we’ll get to him in a moment. Start here: \nThere is too much subjectivity in baseball, from unwritten rules to a home plate umpire’s strike zone. The latter has a tremendous impact on a game, and the volcanic tempers brewing within. \nConsider a batter with a 1-1 count. He takes a pitch that is clearly outside, but perfectly framed by the catcher. The umpire bites. Or maybe he just blows the call. But the subsequent 1-2 count tilts the game in favor of the pitcher, where the OPS (on-base plus slugging) is .489 among major league hitters. \nBy contrast, a 2-1 count results in a .781 OPS (on-base plus slugging). In other words, something bad generally happens to the pitcher. \nBaseball is in the fast lane of an analytical revolution. Theo Epstein will one day break two curses. A.J. Hinch just made the playoffs. If Draft Kings best describes the current growth spurt of the NFL, Data Nerds are now the story of MLB. How much longer will they tolerate stupid human error? \nByrnes was a central part of an experiment over the summer, serving as the strike zone umpire in two games between independent minor league teams, the San Rafael Pacifics and Vallejo Admirals. Balls and strikes were called using the Pitch f/x automated system, which is also responsible for framing every pitch thrown in MLB. \nFormer big-league outfielder Eric Byrnes gestures while using a computerized video system to call balls and strikes at an independent minor-league baseball game between the San Rafael Pacifics and Vallejo Admirals Tuesday, July 28, 2015, in San Rafael, Calif. The computer system stood in for pitch calls in what was considered to be the first professional game without the umpire making those decisions. (Photo: Eric Risberg/AP) \nByrnes said there were no glitches. The home plate umpire felt immense relief. The tone of the game changed dramatically. \n“We didn’t have one issue,” Byrnes said. “Going in, the crew chief said he was skeptical. But by the end of two days, he said it allowed him to do his job as a home plate umpire so much better. He could focus on check swings, foul tips, plays at the plate. He didn’t have to worry about calling balls and strikes.” \nOver the years, I have given MLB a lot of unsolicited advice. In one glorious moment, I was chewed out over the phone by Bud Selig while driving my son to buy his first baseball glove. But this radical change in policy should be a no-brainer, embraced by everyone. \nThere was a time when professional tennis was full of petulant brats arguing line calls with hapless umpires. The invention of Hawk-Eye technology put images on a screen, showing everyone where the ball had landed. Tempers cooled immediately. \nThe technology was only an extrapolation of data, and not a real picture. But it gave the illusion of fairness, order and control. And there was no one to argue with. \nMajor League Baseball could use more technology and less pigheadedness. The Pitch f/x technology is already installed at all ballparks, a three-camera system that records the trajectory of a pitch within a one-inch margin for error. Surely, it can be tweaked for greater accuracy, if needed. Diamondbacks XTRA app: Get latest news, analysis, scores, photos \nImagine the newfound peace in a world without subjective strike zones. Imagine how much faster the game could go without pitchers stalking around the mound in anger, and that kind of stuff. It would prevent all future 17-second stare-downs, which we saw between Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner and umpire Joe West in 2015. \nIt wouldn’t eliminate the umpires. But, mercifully, it would eliminate the \"Ump Show.\" Nobody can argue with that. \nReach Bickley at dan.bickley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8253. Follow him at twitter.com/danbickley.
