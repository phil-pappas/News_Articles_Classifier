This time he might have to beat two. \nTogether with close friend Aksel Lund Svindal, who is back from a season-long injury layoff, last year’s runner-up Kjetil Jansrud plans to start another battle with the Austrian four-time champion when Sunday’s giant slalom kicks off the new season. \nAdd Alexis Pinturault of France, and the quartet of expected favorites for the big crystal globe is complete. \nHirscher says he is ready to take on the challenge but doesn’t know after summer training how fast he is compared to his rivals. \nThe Austrian says “it’s a kind of thriller. Everyone asks me, ‘Where are you now?’ I have no idea.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:55:16.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
