While a tackle, be it solo or assisted, does indicate stopping the ball carrier, it does not note the resulting yardage of the play. Junior safety Anthony Linnear currently leads the University of Findlay football team with 53 total tackles. After starting the previous four games at linebacker. UF coach Rob Keys moved Linnear into starting safety for last week’s 39-38 double overtime loss to Walsh. Since becoming a full-time defensive starter in week 2 against Tarleton State, Linnear has made at least seven tackles in each of the last five games.“It just keeps me moving, mentally,” Linnear said of being productive. “When (the coaches) put me in the position, it just put my mind up and helped me achieve greater heights.” Of Linnear’s 53 tackles, 49 have come on the defensive side, with four from special teams play. Nearly half of those 49, 24 to be exact, have resulted in gains by the opposition of five yards or less. Though Linnear is one of the most productive tacklers for the Oilers, he’s also one of the most inexperienced defensive players for UF, having started out as a running back. In his first two seasons, Linnear rushed for 545 yards and seven scores in 20 games while gaining 4.5 yards per each of his 121 carries. He saw at least 59 carries in those two years, having made two starts.“It’s his character, his work ethic and all of the intangibles that Anthony Linnear brings to this team. That’s why you can do that,” Keys said of the position change. “You can’t have enough Anthony Linnears on the football team.” The Oilers have been striving for defensive consistency all season long, allowing 38.8 points per game and 40.3 in their last three games — all losses. Despite Findlay’s three-game losing skid, the hunger for a win hasn’t changed at all.“It’s status quo,” Keys said. “I told our guys what happened in the past six weeks is irrelevant.” Findlay, which hasn’t lost more than four straight under Keys, will look to break that skid when it hosts Northwood in Saturday’s homecoming and Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game at Donnell Stadium. The Timberwolves are 3-3 overall and 3-2 in GLIAC play. Here are five more keys to Saturday’s game: SERIES HISTORY: Findlay is 8-12 all-time against Northwood, having dropped eight of the last nine games in the series. The Timberwolves prevailed 35-33 last season, starting a three-game losing skid for the Oilers. Northwood is the only GLIAC team Keys has yet to beat, having lost twice to them in four years at UF. The Timberwolves delivered Keys his first UF coaching loss, 14-10 in the 2011 season opener. OPTION ATTACK: Northwood’s option rushing attack hasn’t exactly produced gaudy offensive numbers. The Timberwolves have scored fewest touchdowns (12) in the GLIAC and average only 18 points and 3.6 yards per carry. DEEP THREATS: Northwood’s Mark Morris and Findlay’s Rhys Gervais are the only two quarterbacks in the GLIAC averaging 15 yards per completion. But the statistical similarities stop there as Gervais is completing 64.6 percent of his passes with GLIAC highs of 19 touchdowns and 332.3 yards per game. Morris is completing 51.6 percent, averaging 170.5 yards with six touchdowns to four interceptions. Morris has failed to complete 50 percent of his passes in all three of Northwood’s losses, going a combined 21-for-68 in those games.“Their offense is based off the run and what they do is lull you to sleep and hit the home runs,” Keys said. “What they do is get you in a one-on-one matchup. They only maybe throw four, five deep balls a game, but if you hit two, three, that’s 21 points.” THIRD DOWN AND OUT: Opposing teams are converting third downs at a rate of 68 percent (17-for-25) in Findlay’s last two games, including a season worst 8 for 12 in last week’s loss to Walsh. In the second half alone against Walsh, the Oilers allowed consecutive third-down conversions of 17, 10, 5, 13, 6, 1, and 5 yards before finally making a stop on third down. In the previous game, a 42-39 loss to No. 4 Ferris State, Findlay led 28-14 at halftime, but the Bulldogs were 5 for 6 on third down in the second half.“It’s definitely mentally grinding,” Linnear said of not getting stops on third down. “We have to communicate and just do our jobs. We know it will all work out for us because we believe.” Though the Timberwolves are second-worst in the GLIAC on third down conversions at 39 percent (33-for-84). Meanwhile the Oilers are converting third downs at a rate of 57 percent (47-for-82), good for second in the GLIAC. TAKING THEIR TIME: Northwood is second in the GLIAC in time of possession per game (31:40), having ran 250 rushing attempts to just 133 pass attempts. Last week, Findlay leaned on the running game to control tempo, rushing 62 times for 328 yards. Of the Oilers’ eight drives last Saturday, seven lasted at least three minutes with four of those chewing up more than five minutes of game clock.“Anytime you’re not playing exceptionally well on defense, you want to limit the other teams’ possessions and by doing that it’s by that’s controlling the clock on offense,” Keys said. NOTES: Leonard Hayes is serving as interim head coach for Northwood after 16-year coach Pat Riepma, 54, died of cancer on July 14. Riepma’s 95 career wins are the most in school history. Hayes is in his 21st year on the Timberwolves’ coaching staff, having served multiple roles and most recently defensive line coach.
