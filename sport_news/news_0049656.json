Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 10:48 PM Updated at 11:09 PM Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 10:48 PM Updated at 11:09 PM Kailee Jasewicz and Maria Morotti scored hat tricks for the Little Falls girls soccer team, and the state-ranked Mounties defeated Herkimer 8-0 in a Center State Conference Division II match Thursday in East Herkimer. Little Falls, ranked 12th in the state in Class C, bounced back from its first loss of the season Tuesday, 2-1 to Cooperstown, behind Jasewicz and Morotti, who combined for four goals in the second half. Morotti, the team points leader with 24 goals and 13 assists, also had two assists. Nicole Failing and Morotti scored early in the second half, and Jasewicz then added back-to-goals to give the Mounties (12-1) a 7-0 lead. “The first half, it took us a little while to get out of the gate,” Little Falls coach Sal Marchese said. “I was happy with the second half, the passing, the through balls and we were communicating better.” Jasewicz, a sophomore forward, had one-third of her season goal total against the Magicians (0-6-0, 2-11-1). Jasewicz now has nine goals and two assists. Failing is Little Falls’ second leading scorer with 23 goals and 11 assists. Little Falls outshot Herkimer 12-2 and had a 6-2 advantage on corner kicks. Little Falls 8, Herkimer 0 Little Falls (6-1-0, 12-1-0): Kailee Jasewicz 3-0, Maria Morotti 3-2, Nicole Failing 1-1, Arielle Roux 1-0, Cassie Tinkler 0-1. Kylie Miles 3 saves.
