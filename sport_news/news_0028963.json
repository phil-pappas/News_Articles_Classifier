This is home turf for everyone. You want to win in front of your race team that doesn’t typically get to come to the racetrack and get to celebrate with guys that you don’t typically get to have in victory lane when we travel far away from here, so that’s special. \n“We’ve struggled here the last three or four years and this week we obviously made some good changes to our race car and had a very fast race car. This helps us recharge our batteries and get ready for the next round and come out swinging for that one.” \nWith the victory, Logano automatically advances to the Eliminator round of the Chase and takes over the points lead as many of the top Chase drivers fell out of contention early in the race. \nMatt Kenseth came into Sunday’s race as the series points leader and started from the pole for event, which had been rescheduled from Saturday night due to rain. \nKenseth led 72 of the opening 76 laps but fell back quickly into the top five before falling even further when he overshot his pit stall during a stop on lap 167. \nThe miscue put him deep in the field for the restart, and just five laps later he got turned into the outside frontstretch wall off the bumper of Ryan Newman. \nKenseth’s day only got worse as he hit the wall twice more before finally killing his No. 20 Toyota with 93 laps to go, ending up with a 42nd-place finish and dropping from to dead last in the Chase standings. \nBut Kenseth was far from the only Chase driver to run into their share of bad luck. \nKenseth’s teammate, Kyle Busch, looked to be another strong contender after starting on the outside pole and running in the top five for much of the first half of the race. \nWhile coming to pit road following a caution flag with 104 laps to go, Busch collided with Kyle Larson at the entrance to pit road, damaging both cars and putting them deep in the field for the restart after repairs and pit road penalties. \nBusch never recovered from the setback and came home 20th, falling to 10th in the points ahead of Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who had cut a tire down early and finished four laps down in 28th spot. \nSunday’s disappointing finishes for the Chase contenders were compounded by the fact that after next week’s race at Kansas Speedway, the Chase moves onto Talladega – a track where drivers run on the ragged edge, and one small mistake could cost any of them a shot at the title. \n“This makes Talladega way easier,” said Logano. “I know that’s on everyone’s mind when this round starts and last year we won Kansas when it was the first race of this round and now we were able to get it this time at Charlotte. We’ll get lots of sleep here the next couple of weeks.” \nHarvick’s second-place finish propelled him to second in points, while Truex, Jr. moves into third place and hopefully safe from elimination even if disaster strikes at Talladega. \n“Third is great and all, but it’s no guarantee,” said Truex, Jr. “Talladega is still there. Logano is the only one that’s going to sleep for the next two weeks. I think going to Kansas, a win is huge. It would be so huge. It’s so critical to try to get that win out of the way.” \nCarl Edwards finished sixth in the race and moves up to sixth in the points. Austin Dillon was seventh, followed by Chase drivers Jeff Gordon and Brad Keselowski, who are now seventh and eighth in points, respectively. Aric Almirola rounded out the top ten. \nNASCAR Sprint Cup Series Charlotte Motor Speedway – Concord, NC Bank of America 500 – October 11, 2015 \n1. (3) Joey Logano, Ford, 334, $329873. 2.
