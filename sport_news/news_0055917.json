But Moratti gave the biggest indication yet he could be about to cut his family’s decades-old ties with the club and sell his 29.5 percent share after a shareholders’ meeting on Monday. The remaining 0.5 percent share is held by other, minority shareholders. \n“When you’re useful, or even better, necessary, you stay. But when you realize that outside of the affection and niceness there’s nothing, it’s best to do something else,” Moratti said. \nMoratti on Sunday confirmed reports from last week that his stake was up for sale. Following Inter’s scoreless draw at home to champion Juventus, he said, “My stake is always available to the shareholders.” \nBut there are conflicting reports as to who could step in. Thohir and Etihad Airways have already been touted as possible purchasers of Moratti’s stake, although the club remains coy on the reported involvement of the Emirati company. \nReports claimed Etihad would replace Pirelli as the Serie A giant’s new shirt sponsor, with a five-year deal worth 125 million euros (US$125 million) in the pipeline. If it goes through, it would be a huge boost to Roberto Mancini’s side. Inter currently earn 12 million euros a season with tire giant Pirelli.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:22:02.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
