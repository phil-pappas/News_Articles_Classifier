Liberty left Chester without answers as the Indians’ 27-0 victory Friday closed out. Liberty junior tailback Raleigh Ranne rushed across midfield for a lengthy touchdown as time expired. Ranne’s run was not nearly as stunning as Liberty (5-0, 3-0 Section 9 Class C) shutting out Chester, which entered the game averaging 62.75 points per contest. Liberty head coach John Wilhelm perhaps felt as astonished as Chester. “Good game plan,” Wilhelm said of how Liberty shut out a usually unstoppable offense, pausing. “And a lot of heart and desire from the kids.” Heavy mud through the drizzle slowed everyone’s steps. But one would expect run-heavy Chester (4-1, 3-1 Section 9 Class C) to have more success in rain. Liberty instead stayed a step ahead on many plays. Sophomore Roy Penn-Cosentino returned a punt 52 yards to give Liberty a 21-0 lead in the fourth quarter. Penn-Cosentino’s big play made it nearly impossible for Chester to come back. That allowed Liberty to seize the top spot in the division, which they will likely hold barring future upsets. With a final chance to at least score, Chester quarterback Jack Rose had to dive in the mud on a bad snap. Sophomore linebacker Jon Wilson followed with an interception toward Liberty’s end zone with 2:09 left in the game. Offensively, Liberty stood ground against Chester’s huge, ferocious defensive line. Liberty’s offensive line opened a gaping hole for senior running back Kevin Morgans, who scored on a 44-yard rush. Morgans’ second touchdown of the game gave Liberty a 14-0 lead with 8:04 left in the third quarter. “They were the reason we won this game,” Morgans said of the offensive line. “They beat them off the ball. They fought harder. They stayed lower.” Liberty forced the Hambletonians to pass more than they had in any game all season. But Chester nearly tied the game with a 59-yard rush from senior running back Chris Battiato. Battiato’s run brought Chester 15 yards from the end zone. Another bad snap put the Hambletonians 19 yards back, saving Liberty’s 7-0 lead for halftime. Morgans opened scoring with 4:04 remaining in the second quarter. He received a short screen from senior quarterback Grant Harman and dodged defenders for a 24-yard return. His touchdown closed the first half’s offensive stagnation. It also showed Liberty had the answers to score in harsh conditions. Only matches against Fallsburg and Sullivan West stand between Liberty and a regular-season sectional title. “Right now, they’re riding pretty high,” Wilhelm said. “My job’s going to be to pull them back to reality a little bit. You want them confident, but you don’t want them overconfident.” jbakan@th-record.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:22:34.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
