The Milwaukee Brewers won't be part of the postseason, but there are still plenty of local ties as we head into the season of playoff baseball. \nWe compiled this list of major leaguers and coaches who have a connection with Central Wisconsin: \n1. Kevin Pillar, OF, Toronto Blue Jays \nThis former Wisconsin Woodchucks player has reached rock star status with the Blue Jays. Pillar was a member of the Northwoods League squad in 2010 and could be seen patrolling center field and leading off most games. In 2010, Pillar hit .282 with 47 runs scored, three home runs, 28 RBIs and 24 stolen bases in 69 games as the Woodchucks made the NWL playoffs. But this season, his first full season in the big-leagues, Pillar has made an impact. He is a regular on ESPN highlight reels for his spectacular defensive plays and may win a Gold Glove Award. Pillar has been no slouch with the lumber this year either, overcoming a rough May to hit .278 with 76 runs scored, 12 home runs, 56 RBIs and 25 stolen bases for a potent Toronto offense that leads the Majors in runs scored. The Bluejays (93-69) won the American League East will play the Rangers in a best-of-five American League Divisional Series, which starts Thursday at 2:30 p.m. \n2. Mike Jirschele, coach, Kansas City Royals \nAfter many years playing and coaching in the minor leagues, Mike Jirschele could go to his second World Series in as many years as a member of the Kansas City Royals' coaching staff. (Photo: File/AP) \nJirschele toiled the minor leagues waiting for his shot to reach the big leagues. The Clintonville native spent 13 seasons in the minors as a player and more than 20 more as a coach before getting his shot on former Brewers manager Ned Yost’s staff on Oct. 25, 2013. He is in his second season with the Royals after many seasons coaching in the Royals' minor league system and has been the Royals’ third base coach since May 29, 2014. His son Justin played for University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and is on the Great Falls Voyagers minor-league coaching staff. His son Jeremy was recently named the baseball coach at UW-Stevens Point. Jirschele graduated in 1977 from Clintonville High School, where he starred in football and baseball, being named all-state as a quarterback and receiving interest from the University of Wisconsin before deciding to pursue a baseball career. He was inducted into the Central Wisconsin Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011. \n3.

(Photo: Charlie Riedel/AP) \nPerhaps the most famous former Wisconsin Woodchucks player, Zobrist, 34, still is among the Woodchucks' leaders in career hits. He was the starting shortstop for the 2003 Northwoods League champion Woodchucks and was an MLB all-star selection in 2009. Zobrist was traded from Oakland to Kansas City mid-season and hit .276 with 13 home runs and 56 RBIs with the A’s and Kansas City this year. Zobrist has made the postseason twice before with the Tampa Bay Rays and has two career postseason home runs in 66 at-bats while hitting .212. The Royals face the Houston Astros, who defeated the Yankees in a wild-card playoff on Wednesday, in a best-of-five American League Divisional Series starting Thursday at 6:37 p.m. \n4.

He has become one of the most famous Woodchucks with a phenomenal run in recent years, including making his first All-Star team in 2014 with the Cardinals. Neshek and Zobrist are the only two Woodchucks players to make an MLB All-Star team. This year, Neshek has a 3.62 earned-run average and has appeared in nine career postseason games. Neshek has a career 2.89 ERA in the postseason. \n5. Mark Lowe, relief pitcher, Toronto Blue Jays \nMark Lowe of the Toronto Blue Jays pitches in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia in August.

He was a trade deadline acquisition this year for the Blue Jays and was in the midst of a career year with the Seattle Mariners. Lowe has a 1.96 ERA in 2015 and has struck out 61 batters in 55 innings with a sparkling 1.05 WHIP (walks or hits per innings pitched). Lowe is hoping that carries over to the postseason, where he has struggled with a 0-1 record and a 37.80 ERA in four appearances. \n6. Sam Freeman, relief pitcher, Texas Rangers \nSam Freeman of the Texas Rangers pitches against the Oakland Athletics at Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas, on Sept. 12, 2015. (Photo: Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) \nFreeman played for the Woodchucks in 2007 and had a pretty solid season as a reliever for the Rangers, but the left-hander is not on the Rangers' 25-man ALDS roster vs. Toronto. But as a left-hander, Freeman has a shot to be on the ALCS or World Series roster. In 2015, he struck out 40 batters in 38 innings and had a 3.05 ERA. \nMitchell A.
