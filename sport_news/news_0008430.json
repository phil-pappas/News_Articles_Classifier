(AP) - New Hampshire's Public Utilities Commission has launched a new website to help electricity consumers shop for competitive rates and suppliers.\nThe website can be found at the commission's website under the \"consumer interests\" tab. Shoppers identify whether they are residential or small commercial customers and then select their local utility from a list that includes Eversource, Unitil, NH Electric Cooperative and Liberty Utilities.\nPUC officials say customers can scroll through the various products and prices offered by the suppliers and determine which best meets their needs.\nAmanda Noonan, director of the commission's consumer affairs division, says residential customers have been frustrated by the number of calls they need to make when considering the various offers from suppliers registered to do business in New Hampshire.\nLinks may be found at www.puc.nh.gov\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:48:25.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
