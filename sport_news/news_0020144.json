(Mike Zarrilli/Getty Images/AFP) Report an error \nPolice say former Texas A&M wide receiver Thomas Johnson has admitted to randomly attacking and killing a man on a Dallas jogging trail. \nDallas police Deputy Chief Rob Sherwin says Johnson admitted to killing the jogger with a “large-edged weapon” in a random act of rage on the White Rock Creek Trail early Monday. \nJohnson was arrested after calling 911 from a nearby equestrian center. \nJohnson is being held without bond. Jail records don’t list an attorney who could comment on his behalf. \nAuthorities haven’t released the victim’s name. \nJohnson played for the Aggies in 2012, when Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy as the team’s quarterback. \nJohnson had three catches for 22 yards in A&M’s 29-24 win at top-ranked Alabama. \nHe disappeared a few days later and wasn’t seen until he appeared at his family’s Dallas home three days later.
