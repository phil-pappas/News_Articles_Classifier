Tortorella, who won the Stanley Cup with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2004, has been out of hockey since the Canucks fired him in May 2014 after one season in Vancouver. \nHe takes over for Richards, who had been with the Blue Jackets since 2012 and led them to only their second NHL playoff appearance in 2013-14, an opening-round loss to Pittsburgh. Richards was on the hot seat after Columbus became just the sixth NHL team to open with seven consecutive losses. It's the Blue Jackets' worst start to a season in franchise history, and their longest losing streak since dropping seven straight in regulation from Nov. 11-25. \nWith a 446-375-115 record over 14 seasons, the 57-year-old Tortorella is the NHL's winningest U.S.-born coach. Oilers 3, Red Wings 1: Connor McDavid, the No. 1 overall pick in the June draft, scored his fourth goal of the season to help lift Edmonton. The 18-year-old also has two assists in his first seven NHL games. Hurricanes 1, Avalanche 0: Victor Rask scored 1:49 into overtime, and Carolina won for just the second time in six games. The Hurricanes ended a 10-game losing streak in Denver. Flyers 5, Bruins 4: Claude Giroux's second goal, coming on a power play 2:09 into overtime, capped Philadelphia's comeback from a two-goal deficit in the third period. Advertisement Sabres 2, Maple Leafs 1: Evander Kane tied it with 4:29 left with his first goal for Buffalo, and the Sabres won in a shootout. Chad Johnson made 23 saves for Buffalo. Blues: St. Louis forward Paul Stastny will be sidelined at least five weeks with a broken right foot. The 29-year-old Stastny was injured in the second period of a 4-3 victory in Vancouver on Friday. -- ASSOCIATED PRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:13:52.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
