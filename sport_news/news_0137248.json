Greg Lewis 1 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nComing off a 10-22 record in Eddie Jordan’s second season, the Rutgers men’s basketball team opens practice Friday. Here are five questions for the Scarlet Knights as they prepare for the Nov. 13 opener. \nWhat can we expect from Corey Sanders? There’s going to be a learning curve for the freshman point guard, so put the savior talk on hold. However, word out of preseason workouts is that Sanders has impressed onlookers most with his unselfish playmaking. Combine that with his well-known athleticism, and his development should be exciting to watch. \nWho is going to score? It’s hard to say. Only one player on the roster, Bradley transfer Omari Grier, is an established shooter on the Division I level. Senior guard Bishop Daniels is the top returning scorer (8.4 ppg) but has to take better care of the ball. Rutgers averaged 59 points last year and lost 37 of them. It’s an issue until proven otherwise. \nIs this group ready to run and press? This could be the most athletic team Rutgers has fielded in years. To make the most of his players’ versatility, Jordan has shelved the Princeton-style concepts in search of a freer-flowing style. But it has to flow from the defensive end, and right now, Jordan isn’t ready to commit to frequent pressure until he sees more from his guys in practice. Carino: Rutgers drug-testing policy unfair \nHow is the frontcourt logjam going to shake out? It’s nice to have depth among bigs with Greg Lewis, Deshawn Freeman, D.J. Foreman, Ibrahima Diallo and Shaq Doorson. Freeman’s upside is huge, but he’s playing catch-up after arriving late due to summer school responsibilities. Foreman is trying to transition to the wing, and if he does, that will help. \nCan everyone wipe the slate clean? Seven new faces should help, and Jordan seems energized about working with a roster of his own guys (the dependable Lewis is the lone holdover). Outside expectations are low with good reason, but the reset button definitely has been pushed. \nProjected starting five (as of now): Corey Sanders (PG), Bishop Daniels (G), D.J. Foreman (SF), DeShawn Freeman (PF), Greg Lewis (C). \nFirst off the bench : Omari Grier (G). \nBig Ten media day: Oct. 15. \nRutgers media day : Oct. 27. \nStaff writer Jerry Carino: jcarino@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1FDCSjd TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:44:48.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
