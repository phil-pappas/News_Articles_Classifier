A new era. The end of the June Jones era at SMU was as disastrous as it gets in college football. The coach left the program just before last season's Iron Skillet matchup in University Park after starting 0-2, and interim boss Tom Mason mustered just one win in 10 tries a year ago. But the arrival of former Clemson offensive coordinator and Texas high school coach Chad Morris has brought an energy to The Hilltop missing in recent years. With a focus on recruiting D-FW, a lingering issue under Jones, and an exciting brand of football, Morris has the program headed in the right direction just two games into his tenure.\n2. #PonyUpTempo. Morris' brand of football will no doubt draw interest from area recruits looking to play a fast-paced system, but the Mustangs aren't waiting until those new faces arrive to reap the benefits of the new scheme. A year ago, SMU had just one touchdown in the first four games combined. Under Morris, the Ponies had two touchdowns in the first quarter of the opener, and SMU already has seven, nearly halfway to last year's total of 15. Through two games, the Mustangs are also running about 11 more plays per game than a year ago.\n3. Taking hold. The quarterback situation on The Hilltop was almost as bad as the disaster in the coaches' offices as the Mustangs tried four different quarterbacks before even stating conference play. But after settling into the job in the final few weeks of 2014, Matt Davis is starting to settle into the role with some success. Davis threw for just three touchdowns a year ago and made most of noise in the running game. He's still running all over the place, but he's also thrown for four touchdowns this year and has a 70.2 completion percentage.\n4. Still struggling. After being pretty awful a year ago, the SMU defense started to come into its own during last week's win over North Texas. The Mustangs held UNT quarterback Andrew McNulty to just 128 yards through the air on 34 pass attempts. He didn't throw a touchdown and had two interceptions as well. The Mustangs held the Mean Green to just 240 yards of total offense a week ago and seem to be heading in the right direction defensively, but TCU's offense is much less UNT and much more Baylor, a team that totaled 723 yards of offense against the Ponies in the opener.\n5. Cookware. Folks on The Hilltop were not happy at all when these teams met a year ago, showing their displeasure with a pretty awful attendance showing, especially for a rivalry game. But a rejuvenated program will have both players and fans ready to go for the Battle for the Iron Skillet in 2015. Still, this has been TCU's series of late. The Mustangs beat TCU 15 straight years through 1986, but after receiving the \"death penalty\" from the NCAA, SMU has won just six times in 25 matchups. The Frogs have taken seven of the last eight games over SMU, their last loss to the Mustangs coming in an overtime game in 2011. But it is still a rivalry. No matter how rebuilding needs to be done at SMU, the Iron Skillet is still on the line, and with plenty of momentum, a win in Fort Worth would be a groundbreaking step in returning the Mustangs to glory.\nOn Twitter:\n @RyanGerbosi", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RyanGerbosi"], "published": "2015-09-17T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:40:53.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
