He'll be paired against No. 16 John Hale (4.140 and 304.53) of Addison in the opening round.\nWorsham, 45, joked that the rivalry with Beckman, 49, might be to the point where he'd cut his tires, but \"I'd probably get disqualified.\"\nBecause they have the quickest cars and run neck-and-neck, they're paired in most sessions, running \"in the exact same conditions, just in different lanes,\" Worsham said.\n\"Again, it's not like I can cut him off or anything,\" he said. \"But you can race him, and you can see how you size up.\"\nFrom Texas Motorplex, the Countdown continues Oct. 29-Nov. 1 at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The season-ending race will be at Pomona (Calif.) Raceway on Nov. 12-15.\nWorsham is looking for his first Funny Car world title while driving for Kalitta Motorsports. His qualifying spot Saturday was his 17th No. 1 qualifier and 10th in Funny Car competition. He has wins here in 2002 and 2004.\nIn 2011, Worsham won the Top Fuel world championship before spending a season as Funny Car driver Alexis DeJoria's crew chief. If Worsham wins the Funny Car title, he would be the third driver to win both Nitro categories. Kenny Bernstein and Gary Scelzi also accomplished the feat.\n\"I've always considered myself a Funny Car driver,\" Worsham said. \"I started in Funny Car, and that's pretty much all I've been.\"\nWorsham also has a sentimental attachment to Texas Motorplex. From the press-box suite, he pointed to the track and remembered starting a race in one lane and ending it in another.\n\"I've been coming here myself for over 25 years,\" he said. \"I licensed here when I was 20 years ago. It's a cool place.\"\nSpeaking of California rivalries, the Funny Car 16-team field also pits John Force, 66, of Yorba Linda against his 27-year-old daughter, Courtney.\n\"Dad's running pretty solid this weekend, but I think we have a pretty good race car as well,\" Courtney said.\nIn the rivalry, dad and daughter are tied 7-7. John Force won the only matchup this season at Atlanta (Ga.) Dragway.\nDrew Skillman was the top qualifier in Pro Stock. Skillman's 6.471-second pass in the third session was equal to Jason Line.\nIn a ruling that caused officials to break out the NHRA rule book, Skillman was deemed the record-holder because of his faster overall speed (213.47 compared to Line's 213.40).\nIn Top Fuel, Dave Connolly finished his top run in 3.744 seconds and 329.18 mph, both track records, to start as a No. 1 seed for the first time. Connolly, who won this race last year in Pro Stock, will face Jenna Haddock of Temple to open Sunday's eliminations.\nIn Pro Stock Motorcycle, Jerry Savoie, 56, of Cut Off, La., will start as a No. 1 seed. Savoie clocked a track-record 6.765-second pass at 197.79 mph. It was his third career record and his career-best time.\n\"To go .76 is really, really strong,\" Savoie said.\nOn Twitter: @tommycummings\n30th AAA Texas Fall Nationals\nWhen: Sunday\nWhere: Texas Motorplex, 7500 W.
