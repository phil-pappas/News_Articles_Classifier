(Photo: Courtesy of Orlando City Soccer Club) \nAnthony Pulis helped Orlando City win a USL championship in 2013 as a player. \nNow the 31-year-old from Bristol, England is hoping to do the same as a head coach, taking over the new Orlando City B USL team in 2016. \nAnd he could not be more excited to begin the next chapter of his career. \n“It is a massive honor and privilege to lead our new USL team back into the elite where we have had so much success in the past,” said Pulis, who played for Portsmouth, Stoke City and Southampton as well as other teams in his 10-year playing career. Orlando City B will call EFSC home \nThe midfielder came to Orlando City in 2012 and was a player-coach with the squad, helping them win the USL Pro Championship and two Commissioner's Cups. \nAfter retiring from soccer in 2014 he remained with the Club as an assistant coach with both the first team and the Academy. \n“I have known Anthony for many years and I am confident that he can be a very successful head coach in USL,” Founder and President Phil Rawlins said when Pulis was first introduced. \nPulis, whose father currently manages the West Bromwich Albion squad in the English Premier League, knows guiding this team will be a challenge. \n“We want to play exciting, attractive football that is going to bring in as many people and watch our games on a regular basis,” Pulis said. “Obviously that means winning games, I understand that, but we will have a group of younger guys as well as some experienced players. With inexperienced players you are going to get up and down performances, I think people have to understand that. It is not to say that we don’t want to win, we are confident we can do that.” \nPulis will have some help in molding the team in assistant Robert Valentino, who joined Orlando City in 2011 in the team's inaugural season in the City Beautiful, scoring nine goals in 77 appearances as a center-back. Valentino's résumé includes three Regular Season USL championships and two postseason titles with the Lions – becoming a Club legend during his playing career with Orlando City. \n“If you cut him open, he would bleed purple,” Pulis said of Valentino. “Glad to have him with me.” \nPulis plans to round out his staff in the next couple of months and focus on building this team’s roster. \n“It is going to be primarily younger players who we feel have a lot of potential to improve and obviously go on and represent Orlando City one day,” Pulis said. “We have some very promising young players that unfortunately have not had a chance to play regular minutes. That won’t be the case next year.” \nHe announced the first three signings on Thursday afternoon and they all had a couple of things in common. \n“I want good players, but I want good people as well,” Pulis said. “Good characters that are hungry, willing to learn and willing to progress and go on to fulfill their potential. \n“This is the best opportunity ever for our young players at Orlando City. There is a clear pathway from the academy to the MLS team. Our job as a staff is to make them into MLS players one day.” 37 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1LD96eI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:26:41.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
