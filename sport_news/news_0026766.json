Two sisters, both off-duty NYPD school-safety agents, were arrested after stabbing and stun-gunning teens in a vicious Bronx brawl, cops said Wednesday.\nTamara Hall, 44, and Veronica Hall, 41, got into it with a group of teens after one girl asked Tamara for a cigarette on Jennings St. near Prospect Ave. in Charlotte Gardens around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, police said.\nIt was unclear what sparked the violence, but soon after the request a melee broke out in which Tamara stabbed 17-year-old Hasina Campbell in the stomach with a box cutter, according to authorities. They said Veronica used a stun gun on an 18-year-old woman.\nThe sisters were also wounded in the frenzy, with Tamara suffering a slashed neck and Veronica getting cut in the head.\nThe Halls were cuffed, as was Campbell, the 18-year-old woman who was stunned, another 18-year-old woman, a 23-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl, police said.
