And Illinois may have located its future in the running game.\nFreshman Ke'Shawn Vaughn played a critical role Saturday in the third quarter of the victory against Middle Tennessee when he rushed for 53 yards on seven carries. He finished the game with 80 yards on 13 carries, all of which came in the second half.\n\"I thought he really grew up,\" interim coach Bill Cubit said. \"I really like the way he plays. He was patient with his runs. He's really a smart player.\"\nVaughn would be an important part of keeping Ferguson fresh in games, including Saturday's Big Ten opener against Nebraska at home. Ferguson, a senior, was limited in the third quarter against Middle Tennessee with leg cramps. Ferguson, who Cubit noted takes a lot of hits during games, finished with 83 yards on 20 carries.\nVaughn was a surprise signee for Illinois in the spring, a top recruit out of Tennessee who picked the Illini over Louisville, West Virginia and Purdue.\nThe loss of freshmen Dre Brown and Reggie Corbin to injuries widened the door to opportunity for Vaughn.\nHis emergence could mean more of a balance for Ferguson.\n\"We trust him,\" Cubit said of Vaughn. \"He has earned that trust. Ke'Shawn has to be a player for us.\"\nsryan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @sryantribune\n Nebraska Cornhuskers", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560b24c0/turbine/ct-illinois-football-spt-0930-20150929"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:21:28.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
