EAST DUBUQUE — The No. 1-ranked team in Class 1A poured it on early and often against East Dubuque on Friday night as Lena-Winslow slammed home a 53-0 win with ease. Le-Win (8-0, 7-0 NUIC Northwest) rushed for 388 yards while East Dubuque (3-5, 2-5) netted just minus-4 yards on the ground. Brendan Eilders led the way with 91 yards and two touchdowns, including a 73 yarder to kick off the scoring early. Payden Lindle (8-55 yards) and Chris Stockton (6-51) both scored a pair of TDs for Le-Win as well. Dakota 42, Milledgeville 13: Milledgeville’s Troy Litwiller threw an 11-yard TD pass to Ezra Walker late in the second quarter to cut the Dakota lead to 22-13 and put a scare into the Indians. But led by Greg Krulas (14 carries for 95 yards), Dakota 20 unanswered points to close it out. Andrew Wenger had a touchdown on a fumble recovery in the end zone early on and Dakota had a safety late in the game as well. Orangeville 32, River Ridge 8: Austin Guy scored on a 3-yard run to give Orangeville (1-7) a 6-0 lead, which was the score at halftime of the defensive battle. That sure changed in the second half as Orangeville rolled to the win, snapping a 24-game winning streak. The third-quarter surge was kickstarted by a Mitchell Stites TD and Guy’s third scoring jaunt. River Ridge (0-8) scored late in the fourth to avoid the shutout. Warren 34, Durand 13: Jason Brinkmeier rushed for 70 yards and Warren powered over Durand.
