Openers Anshul and Soumik made a good start, putting on 89 runs before the latter got out. Anshul then found an able partner in Ravi Chauhan and the duo put on 52 runs for the second wicket. \n\nAfter Chauhan's departure, Anshul continued with Rajat and took the team past 200-run mark. They shared a 67-run stand for the third wicket.
