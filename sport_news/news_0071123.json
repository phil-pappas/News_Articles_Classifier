Here, Press Association Sport Formula One Correspondent Philip Duncan looks at the best statistics and trivia ahead of the 16th round of the championship. \n:: Lewis Hamilton, who is 66 points clear of Sebastian Vettel and 73 points ahead of Nico Rosberg, could seal his third F1 title in Austin on Sunday if he wins, and Vettel finishes third or lower. \n:: Hamilton has a good track record across the pond. He won in Austin last year, as well as the inaugural race in 2012, and was also victorious in Indianapolis in his debut 2007 campaign. Of the current drivers, only Vettel, who won in Austin in 2013, has tasted victory on American soil. \n:: Winning this year's title would see Hamilton become the first Briton to successfully defend his F1 crown and will also mark a hat-trick of championships for him. Sir Jackie Stewart is the only other British driver to win the F1 title on more two than occasions. \n:: A third title will see Hamilton join an esteemed list of drivers to have won the title three times or more. He will be the 10th driver to do so; the others being Michael Schumacher (seven), Juan Manuel Fangio (five), Alain Prost and Vettel (both four) and Ayrton Senna, Niki Lauda, Nelson Piquet, Jack Brabham and Stewart (all three). \n:: After winning in Russia, Hamilton now has nine victories to his name this season. He will need to win the remaining four races in Austin, Mexico, Brazil and Abu Dhabi to match Vettel's record of 13 race wins in one season. \n:: Manor driver Alexander Rossi will be the only American on the grid on Sunday. He is the 48th American driver to start an F1 race, and none of his predecessors have ever triumphed on home soil. \n:: Sauber, who made their F1 debut at the 1993 South African Grand Prix, will take part in the 400th race weekend in Austin. During that period they have won one race - as BMW-Sauber - and featured on the podium on 26 occasions. \n:: The Circuit of the Americas in Austin is one of only four anti-clockwise tracks on this year's calendar - Singapore, Interlagos and Abu Dhabi are the others. \n:: Austin is the 10th venue to stage a US GP - Riverside, Sebring, Watkins Glen, Dallas, Detroit, Las Vegas, Long Beach, Phoenix and Indianapolis, have also hosted an F1 race. \nVenue: Circuit of the Americas, Austin \nCircuit length: 5.513km/3.425miles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:15:56.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
