That's an additional 68 companies since the White House first unveiled the pledge in June.\n\"Right now we've got 81 companies who've signed-on to what we're calling the American Business Act on Climate Change. They operate in all 50 states. They've got about nine million employees collectively, and about $5 trillion worth of market cap,” President Barack Obama said Monday. “These are some of the cutting-edge most extraordinary businesses that we have. But it's not just the big companies that are getting involved, it's their suppliers and small businesses that are also getting involved.\"\nBy signing on, the companies promise to advocate for a strong climate deal ahead of final negotiations in Paris next month. They also agree to take steps to reduce their own carbon emissions.\nBy 2020, Intel pledged to be on 100 percent green power in its U.S. operations, to grow use of on-site renewable energy to triple their current levels and build all new buildings to high efficiency LEED gold standards.\nNike pledged to reach 100 percent renewable energy in owned or operated facilities by 2025, to join the Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Challenge and develop new low-environmental impact materials.\nPGE said it would end use of the state’s only coal-fired power plant by the end of 2020, continue investing in hydroelectric and solar projects and move forward smart grid plans.\nThe White House says other companies that signed the deal include Coca-Cola, Monsanto, Google and Walmart.\nPresident Obama is slated to meet with executives at a roundtable at the White House on Monday.\nMore information the changes pledged by the companies can be found on WhiteHouse.gov .\nCopyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation and The Associated Press.
