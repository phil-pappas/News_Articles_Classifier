He has since been released and is due in court on Nov. 24.\nThe Jays eventually won the game 6-3 to win their American League Division Series in five games.\nAfter the incident, Major League Baseball said it would discuss \"comprehensive security plans\" for the remaining post-season games in Toronto.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:17:38.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
