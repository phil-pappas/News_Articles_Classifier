Yasir Shah, who got back injury during net practice just a day before first Test, was feeling pain during fitness test and thus, Pakistan’s team management decided not to risk him in the opening game, as he is the key bowler for Pakistan. According to reports, Right-arm seamer Imran Khan replaced Yasir in the eleven-man squad. According to ESPN CricInfo, Misbah said, “His loss could be a big blow but we are hoping that he will be a fine as he is our key player and we are very much concerned about him”. “Obviously he (Shah) is a key player for us but we are hoping for the best,\" Misbah added. Pakistan's team management is still hopeful that Yasir can make a speedy recovery with the help of extensive treatment. Shah took 24 wickets in Pakistan's 2-1 win in the Tests in Sri Lanka in July and was seen as the danger man for England, who was routed 3-0 by spinners Saeed Ajmal and Abdul Rehman here in 2012.
