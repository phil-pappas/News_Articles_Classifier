The Galaxy (14-10-9) conceded the most goals at home since Sept. 12, 2009, in a 6-3 loss to FC Dallas.\nAdi tied it at 1 in the 65th minute with a turnaround left-footed strike from the middle of the box. Three minutes later, he converted from the spot to give Portland the lead for good.\nDiego Chara netted a leaping header to make it 3-1 in the 74th minute. The Galaxy's Robbie Keane closed the deficit in the 84th, but Darlington Nagbe answered with a breakaway goal 18 seconds after the ensuing kickoff.\nKeane gave the Galaxy the early lead in the 36th minute. The Galaxy would have clinched a berth in the conference semifinals with a win.\nMaximiliano Urruti capped the scoring in the 90th minute. It was the Timbers' first road win against the Galaxy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:29:47.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
