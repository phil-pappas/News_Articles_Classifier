And his trademark aeroplane celebration for the third was of course so very apt. \nAnd it could all have been so different had Mark Kendall not saved Mick Quinn's first half penalty. \n\"People said I had dried up, but this might make them think again,\" Bull said after the St James' Park trip. \nBy 'dried up' he meant, by Bully standards, the kind of drought you'd only find in the deepest depths of the Sahara Desert - one goal in four games. \nThat meant he'd notched 10 in 20 so far that season, again, hardly the tally of an out-of-form striker, but Bully had set goalscoring standards higher than any striker in Wolves' history. \nGraham Turner said of his star man: \"When he's at his best, he'll score goals even against the best defenders. \n\"But he had not been playing particularly well and hadn't looked sharp. \n\"To score four and win at Newcastle though is not a bad start to the year.\" \nYou can say that again. \nAnd Bull, who six months later would be at the World Cup with England, was as modest and unassuming as ever. \n\"I was more happy for the fans really, we did it for them,\" he said. \nClassic Bully. \nNewcastle United 1 Wolves 4 \nBy David Instone \nChants of `Ooh, Bully, Bully' rang out at 25,000ft last night as Wolves fans revelled in the glory of one of the most famous victories in the club's history. \nAs if the successful air-lift of eight plane-loads of supporters wasn't momentous enough for the first day of the 1990s, along came a certain Steve Bull to add the icing to another tremendous afternoon in the long-term Molineux revival. \nFor the first time in his phenomenal Wolves career, Bull scored four in an away match and so blazed the way to Wolves' first win at St James's Park for more than 30 years. \nAs well as putting the finishing touches to an ultimately rewarding holiday programme, the three points lifted Graham Turner's side to eighth in the table and gave them more than just a passing interest in the promotion race. \nThe cluster of strange results in the last four days suggest that the top two places are perhaps not as secure as Leeds and Sheffield United had made us believe. \nAnd, if Bull can retain the form that rocked, shocked and finally humiliated seventh-placed Newcastle, Wolves fans should be only too aware that anything could happen from now on. \nThis was only the side's third away win in the Second Division, but the high-speed all-action way in which it was achieved should send a few shudders through the other challenging clubs. \nFrom a side who looked unconvincing at the start of both halves, Wolves slowly moved up a gear in the first and then exploded into life in the second with Bull rattling in his 12th and fastest hat-trick for the club.

Sub: Sweeney. \nGoal: Brock (74). \nWOLVES: Kendall, Bennett, Venus, Bellamy, Downing (Jones, 85), Streete, Paskin, Cook, Bull, Mutch, Dennison (McLoughlin, 81). \nGoals: Bull (50, 56, 59, 76).
