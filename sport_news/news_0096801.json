(AP) - NASCAR driver Austin Theriault has suffered a compression fracture of his lower back in a head-on crash into a wall in a Truck Series race. \nTheriault was driving Brad Keselowski Racing's Ford when he made contact with teammate Tyler Reddick's truck on Lap 14 on Saturday night at Las Vegas and hit the wall on a part of the track not protected by a SAFER barrier. \nTheriault was helped from the truck and briefly stood before sitting down. He left in an ambulance and was airlifted to University Hospital for observation. \nHe was released from the hospital and will travel back to North Carolina and meet with an orthopedic specialist for further treatment.
