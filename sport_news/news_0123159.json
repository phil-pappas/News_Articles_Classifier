However, they have a huge weapon in wide receiver S.J. Green.\nPick: Argos should win going away.\nOct. 17: vs. Calgary (11-3 before Saturday) Last meeting: The Stampeders won 25-20 on July 13.\nThe skinny: Calgary quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell is the odds-on favourite to be named the CFL’s outstanding player, and some might make a case for his top receiver, Eric Rogers. The game could be played in Hamilton if there is a conflict at the Rogers Centre with the Blue Jays.\nPick: Argos lose. The Stampeders are just too good and deep.\nOct. 23: vs. Montreal (5-8) Last meeting: This will be the second meeting in two weeks.\nThe skinny: Other than S.J. Green, the Argos have to worry about the pass rush, led by John Bowman, second in the league with 10 sacks going into Saturday’s games. This game could also be played in Hamilton.\nPick: Argos win again. Toronto is peaking; it’s hard to see the Alouettes preventing a sweep.\nOct. 30: vs. B.C. (5-8 before Saturday) Last meeting: Toronto overcame 21-point deficit to win 30-27 on July 24.\nThe skinny: Jonathan Jennings threw four touchdown passes in a 46-20 victory over Saskatchewan in the Lions’ last game. Andrew Harris entered the weekend seven yards off the CFL rushing lead.\nPick: Argos lose. The Lions will be licking their wounds over the way they squandered the last game against Toronto, and they want to make a case they belong in the post-season.\nNov. 6: vs. Winnipeg (4-10 before Saturday) Last meeting: Argos beat Winnipeg 27-20 on Aug. 14.\nThe skinny: Quarterback Drew Willy gave way to Robert Marve, who gave way to Brian Brohm. Marve retired not long after the Bombers got Matt Nichols in a trade. The Bombers are much better with Nichols. But not good enough.\nPick: Argos win. You can bet your nickels Trevor Harris will win the quarterback battle.\nOverall: Argos go 3-2, get into the post-season with an 11-7 record.
