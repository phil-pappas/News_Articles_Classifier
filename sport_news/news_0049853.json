Squirrels can run across home plate and spark a rally. Fans can reach out and touch a baseball, and that can help (Yankees) or hurt (Cubs) the home team. Cody Ross can start hitting home runs at a Ruthian pace.\nMLB PLAYOFFS 2015: Best 50 players | Each team's worst postseason memory\nYou just never know. Because, #baseball.\nThat’s been so very true in the 2015 playoffs. Time and time again, baseball has left us aghast, with jaws dropped and the momentary inability to contribute anything but “wow …” to the Twitter conversation. These are those moments.\nThe “wait, what?” play © Provided by Sporting News You’ll never forget this play, so we’ll just rehash the cliff notes version here.\nIt’s a tie game in the seventh inning of Game 5 of the ALCS, a winner-take-all contest. Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin was throwing the baseball back to his pitcher, as he’s done thousands of times in his career. Only this time, his throw hit the hand/bat of Rangers batter Shin-Soo Choo, who happened to be stretching out his left arm over the plate.\nTexas runner Roughned Odor, who was on third base, was watching and raced home as the ball rolled in the direction of left field. He was initially told to go back to third base by home-plate umpire Dale Scott, who called time as the ball went onto the field. After a lengthy delay and review, Odor was correctly allowed to score the go-ahead run.\nThe Blue Jays played the game under protest (not that it mattered).\nThe only thing more stunning about this play was the fact that there is a rule in baseball’s rule book written specifically for this mind-boggling situation. Basically described what happened word for word, just without any names. They thought of everything.\nTake-out slide © Provided by Sporting News This play will most likely lead to a rule change, or at least a more literal enforcement of the rule that’s already in place.\nBecause, as you remember, Dodgers runner Chase Utley, in an attempt to break up a potential double play, barrel-rolled into Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada, not even starting his “slide” until he was past the second-base bag. The collision broke Tejada’s leg, and Utley never touched second base before assuming he was out (as the umpire originally singled) and running back to the dugout.\nBut somehow, after a review, not only were the Mets not given the double-play they wanted—they thought it was interference on Utley—but Utley was ruled safe. The umps decided that a double play wasn’t possible, so the neighborhood rule designed to keep infielders safe was not in effect. And because Tejada didn’t touch second base, Utley was safe. Even though he never touched the base, either.\nThe Mets (and their fans and the New York tabloids ) were no pleased. Again, something will be done to address this in the offseason.\nHeads-up, guys © Provided by Sporting News The Mets trailed, 2-1, in the fourth inning of a winner-take-all Game 5 on the road against Zack Greinke. Murphy singled to lead off the frame, and with one out, Greinke walked Lucas Duda. The Mets had a massive defensive shift on with the pull-happy Duda at the plate, with three infielders on the right side of the diamond.\nAs Murphy casually jogged to second base, rookie shortstop Corey Seager meandered toward the second base bag. Murphy pounced, taking off toward an unguarded third-base bag. He made it without a play. Travis d’Arnaud followed with a sacrifice fly to right field that allowed Murphy to score the tying run.\nAs an encore, Murphy hit a sixth-inning solo home run to put the Mets ahead in a game they’d eventually win by that final 3-2 score.\nSchwarber blast © Provided by Sporting News The ball Cubs rookie Kyle Schwarber hit in Game 4 of the NLDS against the Cardinals should land at some point in the next day or two, if it hasn’t gotten caught up in Earth’s orbit. Which might have happened.\nWhen Schwarber hit his home run in the seventh inning, off Kevin Siegrist, there wasn’t an instant cheer from the Wrigley Field faithful, as there had been for all of the other homers the Cubs had hit in the two games there. There was a pause, as if every fan in the stadium gasped in disbelief as they watched what the stocky rookie did to that poor baseball.\nAnd then, the stadium exploded. That home run capped the scoring and helped the Cubs clinch the franchise’s first postseason series victory ever at Wrigley.\nCubs fan John Cusack, on what he thought as he watched Schwarber’s home run .\nI got it, I got it … I don't got it © Provided by Sporting News At the time, it seemed like a relatively harmless miscommunication. The Blue Jays were up, 3-0, in the seventh inning of Game 2 of the ALCS in Kansas City, and Toronto starter David Price was rolling. He’d retired 18 consecutive Royals when Ben Zobrist lofted a pop-up into short right field to lead off the seventh.\nSecond baseman Ryan Goins was tracking and calling the ball the whole way, so right fielder Jose Bautista backed off. At the last second, Goins peeled off, though, as if he’d heard someone say something. Replays pretty clearly showed Bautista didn’t say anything, but it didn’t matter. Zobrist reached first safely, and the floodgates opened.\nBy the time the inning ended, Price was gone from the game . The Royals collected six hits and five runs, and they’d go on to win the game, 6-3, to take a 2-0 series lead.\nDoink, doink, doink © Provided by Sporting News We’re not done with Game 5 of the division series between the Rangers and the Blue Jays. Not by a long shot.\nAfter the craziness of the top of the seventh, Texas had a 3-2 lead. But Russell Martin reached when Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus booted his grounder up the middle. That’s Error No. 1. And then Martin was safe at second when Andrus couldn’t handle first baseman Mitch Moreland’s low throw, a play that would have at least been a force out and possibly a double play.\nThat’s Error No. 2.\nThen Ryan Goins tried to sacrifice the two runners up a base. Third baseman Adrian Beltre fielded the bunt, spun and made a perfect throw to Andrus covering third. And Andrus just flat-out dropped the throw. That’s Error No. 3.\nOn three plays. Three routine plays.\nYada, yada, yada … then this happened .\nComeback kids © Provided by Sporting News The defending AL champion Royals were in big trouble, trailing 6-2 in the eighth inning of Game 4 of the ALDS and trailing the series 2-1 to the Astros. Lose and they were done.\nAs you know, they didn’t lose.\nAnd their comeback happened in an incredibly death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts fashion for the Astros. Kansas City opened the inning with five consecutive singles, which led to a pair of runs to cut the deficit to 6-4. Then, the pain really set in for Houston.\nKendrys Morales hit a chopped up the middle that glanced off pitcher Tony Sipp’s glove and then off shortstop Carlos Correa’s glove for what was called an error on Correa. That chased home two more runs and tied the score. The Royals scored again to take the 7-6 lead, and an Eric Hosmer two-run homer in the ninth gave Kansas City a three-run lead. That was more than enough for closer Wade Davis to close out the stunning victory.\nBabe Ruth wears a Mets uniform © Provided by Sporting News Daniel Murphy hit 14 home runs in 538 plate appearances during the regular season for the Mets, a number that was a career high.\nIn the postseason, he’s been unbelievable. In his first 26 plate appearances of the postseason, Murphy hit five home runs.\nThat’s crazy impressive on its own.\nBut those five home runs came off four of the best pitchers in baseball. Murphy — a left-handed hitter, remember — popped two homers off the best lefty in baseball, Clayton Kershaw. He hit that NLDS Game 5 home run off Cy Young co-favorite Zack Greinke. He homered in Game 1 of the NLCS off lefty Jon Lester. And he did it again in Game 2, against the other Cy Young co-favorite, Jake Arrieta.\nIncredible.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4657980-chase-utley-slide-mets-dodgers-controversy-new-york-media-ruben-tejada-injury-matt-harvey", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658511-mlb-playoffs-2015-alcs-blue-jays-royals-david-price-struggles-rally-barbecue", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657357-mlb-teams-worst-postseason-memory-yankees-red-sox-braves-cardinals-cubs-bill-buckner-steve-bartman-jorge-orta?eadid=SOC/Twi/SNMain", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658212-mlb-playoffs-2015-rangers-errors-bautistas-homer-spark-blue-jays-comeback-in-wild-seventh-inning", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658117-mlb-playoffs-2015-cubs-clinch-john-cusack-wrigley-field-kyle-schwarber-home-run-alternate-universe", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657340-mlb-playoffs-2015-players-best-ranks-ratings"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:47:40.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
