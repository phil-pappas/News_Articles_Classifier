(AP Photo/Ron Schwane, File) \nAKRON, Ohio — LeBron James is teaming up with Michelle Obama to celebrate the importance of secondary education at a private event at the University of Akron. \nThe NBA superstar and first lady will host thousands of children and their parents Wednesday at the school. The kids are from the programs James has started through his family's foundation. \nDuring the summer, James announced a partnership with the university to provide free four-year educations to city students who qualify. \nObama recently launched her Reach Higher public awareness campaign to encourage students to aim higher than just a high school diploma. \nJames, who went from high school to the pros, grew up in Akron, and the 30-year-old father of three has spent much of his career giving back to his community. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:14:15.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
