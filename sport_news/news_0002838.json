Here is our weekly ranking of the coaches in most danger of losing their jobs when the season ends: \n1. Gus Bradley, Jacksonville Jaguars : We love your enthusiasm, Gus, but 8-30 ain't gonna cut it ... even in Jacksonville. \nLast week: 4 \n2. Andy Reid, Kansas City Chiefs: Over the last four-plus seasons, Reid's teams have gone 33-38 and haven't won a playoff game. \nLast week: 2 \n3. Jim Caldwell, Detroit Lions: Temporarily benching Matthew Stafford and using fake punts? Looks like Caldwell may be starting to push the right buttons with his team finally finding the win column. \nLast week: 1 \nChuck Pagano's fake punt decision is still water cooler material. (Photo: Matt_Kryger / The_Star) \n4. Chuck Pagano, Indianapolis Colts: Your team finally played the Pats tough, but that gets overshadowed by that fake punt thing . Losing high stakes gambles means lowered chances you're back with Indy in 2016. \nLast week: 7 \n5. Jay Gruden, Washington Redskins: With Kirk Cousins plateauing, at best, and Andy Dalton making a quantum leap without him, Gruden's rep as a quarterback whisperer coming under further scrutiny. \nLast week: 6 \n6. Ken Whisenhunt, Tennessee Titans: He shouldn't have exposed Marcus Mariota to further injury. He should look in the mirror after leading the Titans to consecutive 1-4 starts. \nLast week: Not ranked \n7. Lovie Smith, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: The bye cools the hot seat. A matchup with Washington could bring further relief. \nLast week: 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:24:41.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
