The incident took place on Friday April, 18, 2014 in the 200 block of Broadway Street.\nPolice say on that day, around 3 p.m., two unknown black men, armed with guns, forced their way into the home of a 36-year-old man. The men ransacked the home, while looking for drugs. The victim told the men that he did not have any drugs, nor did he use any. The men then took the victim's wallet before running from the home.\nThrough further investigation, detectives were able to link 21-year-old Tre Bridges to the incident. He was arrested Wednesday and booked with armed robbery.\nJerel Forrest and Jonathan Williams, both 20-years-old, were previously arrested for the their part in the incident. Police were able to use a cell phone dropped outside the home to link Williams to home invasion. He was arrested in June 2015 and charged with home invasion. Detectives apprehended Forrest on Tuesday and charged him with armed robbery.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
