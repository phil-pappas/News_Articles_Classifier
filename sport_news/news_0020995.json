The top seeded Indo-Swiss pair bounced back brilliantly from their first set defeat to claim a 6-7 (9-11), 6-1, 10-8 win over the Taiwanese pair of Chan Hao-ching and Chan Yung-jan in the summit clash that lasted one hour and 40 minutes on Saturday. Sania and Hingis upstaged their opponents in the third and final set during which the score once read 7-7 before the winners clinched three of the next four points to win their eight women's doubles titles this year. The eight wins for the pair, since joining forces in March, include two Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon and the US Open. Throughout the year, the pair has won at Indian Wells, Miami, Charleston, Wimbledon, US Open, Guangzhou, Wuhan and the China win. A visibly tired Mirza expressed her joy over her victorious innings with Hingis this year. \"I feel really good. I am happy to be back and to win four tournaments in a row. It's been very good for us and I am looking forward to one week off because I am really sick. So, I am looking for one week off and then going back to Singapore,\" said Mirza. The Singapore Open will start from October 25 and will conclude on November 01. The forthcoming tournament will give Mirza an opportunity to continue her scintillating run this year during which she has already bagged nine titles. Earlier in August this year, Mirza was awarded country's highest sports award and became the second tennis player after Leander Paes to receive the prestigious Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award.
