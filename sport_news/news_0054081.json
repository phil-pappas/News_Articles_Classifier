A world championship winning selfie Tweet \nThe 25-year-old secured the title at the Polish Grand Prix last night. \nWoffinden endured a tough night in Torun failing to make the semi-finals, but still scored enough points to win the title with one round of the championships remaining. \nIn doing so he becomes the first two-time British World Championship winner since Peter Craven in 1962. Here's the emotional moment @TWoffinden became a double #speedwaygp world champ! #TorunSGP pic.twitter.com/3migkYTpq7 ‚Äî SpeedwayGP (@SpeedwayGP) October 3, 2015 \nAn emotional but jubilant Woffinden said: \"It feels great to get the reward after working so hard all year and it's definitely paid off. \n\"2013 just happened - it was hard to put my finger on exactly what it was. This year I know every little thing that we've done, we've all worked unbelievably and I've got some great people around me. \n\"In 2014 I made some mistakes and did things I didn't need to do but I needed that year as it taught me a lot. I've learnt from those mistakes and I've proved I've done things right this year. Thanks for all the messages I'm slowly getting through them all! The support of the fans is just awesome so thank you üèÜ #TW108 ‚Äî Tai Woffinden (@TWoffinden) October 4, 2015 \n\"This shows I'm going to be one of those top riders for a very long time. After winning it twice you can put me up there with Tony Rickardsson, Nicki Pedersen, Jason Crump, Greg Hancock and I know I've got what it takes to add even more in the future. More on this story: Tai Woffinden returns to Wolverhampton \n\"Loads of British fans made the journey and it was great to have them here for that. \n\"To be able to lift the trophy in Australia will be amazing. I'll still go there and try and score as many points as I can; I want to have a nice looking amount of points between first and second when I get my hands on that World Championship.\" Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
