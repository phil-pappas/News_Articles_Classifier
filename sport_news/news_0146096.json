He played two of the final three games, batting seventh. \nManager John Gibbons says it was an easy decision to put Tulowitzki behind sluggers Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion. \nTulowitzki hit .239 with five homers and 17 RBIs in 41 games after being acquired from Colorado on July 28. \nGibbons also says Dioner Navarro will catch right-hander Marco Estrada in Game 3. Russell Martin is set to catch the first two games. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:23:12.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
