(WZZM) -- This week's Meijer Scholar Athlete is Alex Cooke, a senior from Zeeland East High School. \nHe's a hard-worker and valuable member of the Chix football program. Along with playing on the gridiron, he plays basketball and is part of the track team. \nThe senior excels in academics, with a 4.2 GPA -- and that's quite an accomplishment, especially when taking multiple advance placement classes. He is a member of the National Honor Society and has maintained honors all throughout his high school career. \nNext year, he plans on going to college to pursue a degree in the biomedical research field. \n\"Football, you know -- having something to do -- gives you less time for homework, but then that makes you want to work harder,\" Cooke said. \"It makes you focus more; since you have more things going on, you have to buckle down harder. I would like to go to college, I guess; that's always how it's been in my family...Only a few people can do football forever, so I figured I would have to find something else to do and school is where it's at.\" Read or Share this story: http://www.wzzm13.com/story/sports/high-school/scholar-athlete/2015/10/21/meijer-scholar-athlete-alex-cooke/74361568/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:09:23.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
