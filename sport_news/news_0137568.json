It was strange.”\nWhen previously last seen at the Garden, Duclair had been in street clothes, a healthy scratch for the Blueshirts for the club’s Dec. 8 overtime victory over the Penguins. That marked his third straight game out of the lineup after having played in 17 of the Rangers’ first 23 matches.\nThe following day, Dec. 9, Duclair was loaned to Team Canada for the World Junior Tournament, after which the winger returned to his QMJHL Quebec Remparts for the remainder of the season.\n“When I went back to juniors I thought I’d be coming back here this year,” said Duclair, who has five goals and two assists in seven games. “Like I said, I was really shocked by the trade. But I’m happy now. It’s a great fit for me.”\nThere is no bitterness. Why should there be?\n“I had a great time in New York; getting to play with guys I looked up to like Marty St. Louis, Rick Nash and Henrik Lundqvist—St. Louis, especially—was an honor for me,” said Duclair, robbed by Lundqvist on an acrobatic stop with 4:50 to go and the score 3-1. “And being here for the start of last year gave me more confidence coming into this training camp.\n“It was tough for me to be in and out of the lineup [in New York] but I understood the situation,” he said. “Here, I’m getting to play. I couldn’t be happier.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:12:58.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
