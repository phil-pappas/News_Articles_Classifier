I didn’t know what to do. I was just over there praying that they stopped them. I wanted to be out there to stop them too,” Wetumpka running back Kevosiey Smoke said. \nThe Wetumpka defense held Anderson a half yard short on the fake field goal attempt, and held on for the 14-13 rivalry win on Friday night. \n“To be in such a close game with a rival like that, and both teams making plays, and for our guys never to get their head down in doubt, I’m just so very proud,” Wetumpka coach Tim Perry said. \nThe Indians (2-4, 2-2 Class 6A, Region 2) rode Smoke and Deandre Williams to victory. Smoke had 134 yards on 15 carries, and Williams ran 11 times for 104 yards and a touchdown. \nSmoke had a 66-yard run to end the first quarter, but fumbled at the end of the run. He bounced back with a 5-yard touchdown late in the second quarter to give the Indians a 7-0 lead at the half. \n“My teammates just cheered me on and told me to do better next time, just hold on to the ball. I just scratched that out of my mind,” Smoke said. \nAnderson ran for a 4-yard score on the opening drive of the second half to tie the game. Williams put Wetumpka back on top by emerging from a pile of defenders and running 35 yards for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter. \nAfter trading punts, the Mustangs (0-6, 0-4) put together an 11-play drive in the final 2 minutes to get in the end zone. \nTrailing by one with the extra point pending, Stanhope came out on offense for the two-point conversion. After a timeout, the Mustangs came out in field goal formation, but went with a fake punt. \n“Our defense, we had about three guys go down, star linebacker had a concussion. We knew we had to go for two down here. We lined up, and they were ready for the play that we called. And we’ve got a fake field goal that we run, a wedge play, and I think he came up about a half yard short,” Stanhope coach Jeff Foshee said. “If he would’ve made it, it would’ve been the play of the night. But he didn’t quite get in there. That’s my fault. But that’s what we felt like we had to do.” \nAfter a stellar end to the 2014 season, and high hopes entering 2015, the Mustangs are 0-6 for the first time in school history. \n“To this point, we’ve played some pretty good football teams. I felt like we could’ve won tonight, but we were a play here, a play there from getting a win. We get beat by one point, and we had opportunities in the first half to make a play and didn’t score,” Foshee said. “I felt like we should’ve probably scored a couple in the first half. But it is what it is. We’ll go back to work Monday and hopefully we can get ready for the next one, get a win, and move on from there.” Buy Photo Stanhope's Kareem Jackson runs Wetumpka's Nick Turner during the game on Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, in Wetumpka, Ala.
