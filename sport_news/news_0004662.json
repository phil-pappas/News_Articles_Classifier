Tal’s Hill, a tribute to Cincinnati’s Crosley Field and other old ballparks, is named after former longtime Astros executive Tal Smith. \nShort URL : http://wtaw.com/?p=99753 Weather info for College Station STAY UPDATED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:25:31.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
