Watt, have graduated to bigger things — including contracts — it’s time to get excited about a new wave who were all born in late 1990 or later — the best players under age 25.\nAlthough rookies were considered, in most cases, there was a slightly more experienced player to trump them. To be fair and more exclusive, we’re again limiting the list to 25, accounting for all the typical All-Pro team positions through offense, defense and special teams.\nMORE: Best current NFL players at each jersey number, 1-99 | NFL's craziest fans\n1 QB: Derek Carr, Raiders\n© Provided by Sporting News He gets the nod over his best competition from the 2014 draft, Teddy Bridgewater and Blake Bortles. Carr, already drawing comparisons to a young Aaron Rodgers, is showing off just how good he can be when getting more help from his pass protection and wide receivers. The Raiders have their most exciting QB option since Rich Gannon.\n2 RB: Le'Veon Bell, Steelers\n© Provided by Sporting News This was the easiest choice. Bell has everything you want in an old-school feature runner: patience, vision, power and explosiveness. He also is an exceptional receiver and a threat to go the distance every time he sees the open field. He also benefits from meshing with an exceptional run-blocking line.\n3 RB: Carlos Hyde, 49ers\n© Provided by Sporting News When a team moves on from the reliable, ageless Frank Gore, you know it better have a pretty good replacement. Hyde is a nightmare for defenses because he’s a bruising back who can also elude tacklers with great quickness. He’s built well to succeed behind the elite left side of their line.\n4 WR: Odell Beckham, Jr., Giants\n© Provided by Sporting News He became an overnight sensation with his gravity- and logic-defying catches in one of the best offensive rookie seasons ever. He’s not quite dominating at the same ridiculous level, but that doesn’t mean he won’t end up being just as special as a sophomore.\n5 WR: DeAndre Hopkins, Texans\n© Provided by Sporting News Houston has a problem with its quarterbacks, but that hasn’t slowed down Hopkins one bit. Neither has the departure of Andre Johnson and drawing the primary attention of secondary coverage. He’s now a complete receiver who’s emerged as a premier No. 1, on pace to challenge the records for both targets and catches.\n6 TE: Austin Seferian-Jenkins, Buccaneers\n© Provided by Sporting News It takes a while for players at this position to become complete and figure things out as both a receiver and a blocker. ASJ is here more for his upside than what he’s done — having a lingering shoulder injury doesn’t help — but at 6-5, 262, has the size to be the next athletic, dominant red zone force, a la Rob Gronkowski and Tyler Eifert (who just turned 25).\n7 T: Tyron Smith, Cowboys\n© Provided by Sporting News It’s hard to believe that the game’s premier athletic left tackle still isn’t old enough to rent a car without limitations. Dallas got him young, and then locked him up to be its pass-protecting anchor for well after Tony Romo hangs it up. The fifth-year player will turn 25 in December.\n8 T: Jake Matthews, Falcons\n© Provided by Sporting News Matthews gets the slight edge over Saints tackle Terron Armstead because after Matthews' major struggles as a rookie, his pedigree as a can’t-miss, lock down left-side force has come to fruition in front of Matt Ryan in Year 2. He’s like Joe Thomas, another easy long-term bookend.\n9 G: Zack Martin, Cowboys\n© Provided by Sporting News Here we go again with Dallas’ outstanding youthful, all-around skilled line. Martin stepped in immediately and looked like a top-five blocker at this position, delivering inside with his tackle-like athleticism.\n10 G: Gabe Jackson, Raiders\n© Provided by Sporting News Lost in the fact that Oakland is assembling a lot of exciting offensive skill players is that the team is much improved up front. Veteran Donald Penn has found his groove at left tackle, while Jackson has dominated even more right next to him at left guard. Both Jackson and Zack Martin can soon challenge Baltimore’s Marshal Yanda for best guard in the league of any age.\n11 C: Travis Frederick, Cowboys\n© Provided by Sporting News Let’s make it a worthy three from what Jerry Jones has assembled up front through the wise use of first-round picks. Frederick is just a little more established than the rising star with the rival Giants, Weston Richburg.\n12 DE: Khalil Mack, Raiders\n© Provided by Sporting News Mack’s transition to a 4-3 edge rusher has been eased as Jack Del Rio uses him in the Von Miller-like OLB/hybrid role he was meant to play. Although the new base position makes him less active as a tackler downfield, he’s become better in surging upfield to get after the passer. The Raiders just need to give him a lot more help in pass defense.\n13 DE: Fletcher Cox, Eagles\n© Provided by Sporting News Cox makes the cut again, as he’s still 24 and even more dominant as a pass rusher (5 sacks already, a half short of a career-high). He’s also the reason Philadelphia fields a super-stingy run defense. J.J. Watt remains the league’s best 3-4 end, but Cox may soon be the clear No. 2.\n14 DT: Aaron Donald, Rams\n© Provided by Sporting News He hasn’t lost anything from his standout debut that earned him NFL rookie defensive player of the year. St. Louis has a pretty good case to say it has the nastiest and deepest front four. Meet the new best defensive tackle in the league.\n15 DT: Sharrif Floyd, Vikings\n© Provided by Sporting News He’s already in his third season at 24, and the first-rounder from Florida is trying to build on his breakout 2014 in a Mike Zimmer scheme tailored to his strengths as a backfield disruptor. He also easily has the best first name on this team.\n16 OLB: Anthony Barr, Vikings\n© Provided by Sporting News Sound the horn for Minnesota’s defense again, this time for another more recent first-rounder, the team’s worthy No. 9 overall pick in 2014. He has quickly ascended to best 4-3 outside linebacker in the game with no weaknesses. At 6-5, 255, he’s an amazing athlete for the position.\n17 OLB: Jadeveon Clowney, Texans\n© Provided by Sporting News Here’s our choice for the base 3-4 guy at the position. Don’t be fooled by the 22-year-old still looking for his first career sack after a rookie season lost to a knee injury. Clowney is finally showing the explosiveness that made him the No. 1 overall pick in 2014. To live up to his full potential, he must stay on the field, as he has already lost a Year 2 game to an ankle injury.\n18 ILB: C.J. Mosley, Ravens\n© Provided by Sporting News It’s been a brutal year for Baltimore’s pass defense, and Mosley hasn’t been immune to the struggles since the team lost its leader, Terrell Suggs, who did a lot to help playing next to Mosley at outside linebacker. Mosley has still managed to make big plays upfield and in coverage, and is the reason their run defense remains formidable.\n19 CB: Ronald Darby, Bills\n© Provided by Sporting News It took us all the way to the secondary before we tabbed our first rookie, but it was hard to ignore Darby, the Florida State product who’s even outplayed Buffalo’s other fine young corner, Stephon Gilmore, already 25. Darby had 10 passes defensed and two INTs in his first month as an NFL player. Not bad at all.\n20 CB: Marcus Peters, Chiefs\n© Provided by Sporting News If it hadn’t been for Darby, Peters would have been the NFL’s defensive rookie of the month in September. Peters has been burned at times like the rest of Kansas City’s secondary, but the first-rounder has delivered, using his size (6-0, 197) and swagger and making plays reminiscent of a young Antonio Cromartie.\n21 S: Tyrann Mathieu, Cardinals\n© Provided by Sporting News Mathieu is an awesome Swiss Army knife in the middle of Arizona’s defense, a versatile cover man and quick tackle who operates as half slot corner, half extra linebacker. The former “Honey Badger,” still only 23, was a sweet steal of a third-round pick in 2013.\n22 S: Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Packers\n© Provided by Sporting News It was a tough call between him and the Jets’ Calvin Pryor, taken three spots ahead of Clinton-Dix who was the No. 21 overall pick in 2014. Although we respect Pryor’s skills as an able thumper, Clinton-Dix is just the better all-around playmaker for now, despite some issues in coverage — which he is smart enough to correct.\n23 K: Brandon McManus, Broncos\n© Provided by Sporting News It’s not just that Mile High altitude in Denver. McManus has a monster leg at 24 and was a terrific find out of Temple. We know Peyton Manning is struggling in 2015, but it’s still saying something that McManus has been their biggest offensive weapon.\n24 P: Pat O'Donnell, Bears\n© Provided by Sporting News Good to see another talented Irish kid do well on the South Side of Chicago. He’s been very good in his two years, a throwback to their long-time punter, Brad Maynard. As a bonus, O’Donnell also holds the ball well for Robbie Gould.\n25 KR/PR Jarvis Landry, Dolphins\n© Provided by Sporting News This was our sneaky way to get in our third favorite young receiver in the mix, but Landry has earned this spot to join his former LSU teammate, OBJ. At publish time, the second-year sensation was averaging 19.1 yards per punt return in 2015, thanks to a 69-yard TD in 2015. He also is pretty good at scoring as a wideout and Statue of Liberty running back.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4656814-nfl-craziest-fans-teams-wild-rowdy-best-worst-dressed-photos-pictures", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4655262-best-current-nfl-players-at-each-jersey-number-1-99-russell-wilson-jj-watt-aaron-rodgers-odell-beckham-jr", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:25:35.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
