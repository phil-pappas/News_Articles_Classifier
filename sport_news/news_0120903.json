Chargers offensive line numbers are dwindling rapidly Privacy Policy | More Newsletters Getty Images MINNEAPOLIS, MN - SEPTEMBER 27: Philip Rivers #17 of the San Diego Chargers watches the replay on the jumbotron after his pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown by Chad Greenway #52 of the Minnesota Vikings at TCF Bank Stadium on September 27, 2015 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. (Photo by Adam Bettcher/Getty Images) The Chargers are burning through offensive linemen like a college kid with access to his parents' no-limit credit card. Through three games they've already run eight guys out there and if the injury report from Wednesday's practice is any indication that number will increase this weekend. Left tackle King Dunlap (concussion), left guard Orlando Franklin (ankle) and center Chris Watt (groin) all missed practice completely. It does not bode well for them to return to the field on Sunday against the Browns at Qualcomm Stadium. Right guard D.J. Fluker (ankle, chest) and reserve tackle/guard Chris Hairston (ankle, knee) both were able to practice in full but I saw D.J. walking off the field and he was hobbling pretty good. So, if any of you had right tackle Joe Barksdale in the offensive line survival pool ... CONGRATULATIONS! You win. The Bolts brought veteran J.D. Walton in to the mix this week. He started 36 games at center with Mike McCoy in Denver and knows the offensive system well enough to get by on short notice. Walton started all 16 games with the Giants last year and can play guard if need-be. San Diego also promoted tackle Tyreek Burwell from the practice squad. The undrafted rookie out of Cincinnati is 6'5\" and weighs 305 pounds. In addition to them Kenny Wiggins, who has appeared in two games already, could be thrust in to the starting lineup at either guard or tackle against Cleveland. All of this has to worry Chargers fans about just how well the front-5 can protect quarterback Philip Rivers. \"The intention and expectation is we're going to weather the storm,\" said Rivers, who was sacked four times and hit 12 more in a Week 3 loss to Minnesota. \"Maybe we'll be better for it in the long run. We'll be fine. We really will.\" Ever the optimist, Rivers will have new pieces to plug in again. It's something he's grown used to doing, and that is not the kind of experience any QB wants to have on his resume. Back in 2006 the Chargers used the same starting offensive line combination in 15 of 16 games. It's likely no coincidence they went 14-2 that year. Stability on the offensive line would certainly help the 2015 Bolts.
