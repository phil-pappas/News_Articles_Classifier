Texas has won three straight to open the season and has won its last two on the road. \nThe IceHogs (1-2-0-0) took the lead with a power-play goal in the first period and the Stars responded with four straight scores to take a 4-1 lead in the third period. \nShore tied it with a short-handed goal at the 10:57 mark in the first period. Less than a minute later, Shore gave Texas the lead when he got a loose puck from a tie-up on a face-off and slipped it past Rockford goalie Michael Leighton. \nDerek Hulak put Texas up by two in the second period and Shore completed the hat-trick at 7:26 in the third when he knocked in a one-timer. Rockford’s Tanner Kero cut the lead to two with less than ten minutes left, but Texas’ Brendan Ranford put Texas up by three with an empty-net goal in the closing minutes of the third.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:06:33.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
