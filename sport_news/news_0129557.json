Alcid and Janssens had disagreed over the budget for some fire station artwork.\nAlcid and a deputy fire chief -- who witnessed part of the incident -- have said they didn't immediately file complaints with the city's Bureau of Human Resources because they worried about keeping their jobs. But as Alcid's planned retirement date from his job as senior facilities maintenance neared, he ultimately did complain -- in October 2014, 10 months after the incident.\nJanssens responded to human resources by disputing Alcid's account, saying she only placed her hands on top of Alcid's shoulders, near his neck.\nThe city found in a May 2015 report that although the physical contact was unwelcomed, it lasted only a short few seconds and didn't cause Alcid any \"physical distress.\"\nThe city also determined that the chief was \"discourteous.\" Portland City Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who also is fire commissioner, decided not to discipline Janssens. Janssens is Portland's first female fire chief and has held the position more than three years now.\nIn June 2015, the incident and the decision not to discipline the chief became public. In July 2015, the city was forced to release its human resources report into the incident. Although the city had refused to release the report, The Oregonian/OregonLive appealed to Multnomah County District Attorney's Office and the office ordered that it be made public.\nDOCUMENT: Portland's Bureau of Human Resources Investigative Report\nCommissioner Saltzman might have fanned some flames in June by stating, as reported in The Oregonian/OregonLive: \"After reviewing the investigation by the City Attorney's office and the Bureau of Human Resources of Mr. Alcid's complaint, it was clear to me that a retired employee was attempting to undermine Chief Janssens' authority.\"\nAfter seeing Saltzman's statement, Alcid told The Oregonian/OregonLive in June that he was disgusted.\n\"I thought I was taking the high road by not pursuing financial compensation for the Chief's actions and just reporting it to HR,'' Alcid said.\nOn Monday -- four months later -- Alcid filed his lawsuit. But he lists only Janssens -- and not the city -- as a defendant.\nPortland attorney Kevin Keaney is representing Alcid.
