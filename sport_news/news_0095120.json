(Photo by Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images) Toronto has caught Blue Jays fever.\nAdChoices On Thursday morning at 10 a.m., the Toronto Blue Jays started selling tickets to the American League Championship Series.\nAt 10:30 a.m., SVP of Business Operations for the Blue Jays Stephen Brooks sent a tweet out saying that 80,000 fans were in queue to purchase tickets. Keep in mind that the Rogers Centre holds 54,000 at capacity.\nThere are 80,000 people in queue for tickets so system slows. Don't refresh or leave page. Take whatever tix you get is my advice.\n— Stephen R Brooks (@sbrooksbaseball) October 7, 2015 By 11:18 a.m. they were sold out.\nThere's no guarantee that these tickets will even be used -- the Jays will have to get through the suddenly-hot Texas Rangers in the ALDS to advance. But if they do, you can count on Toronto fans filling the stadium to the brim as they make their first playoff appearance since 1993.\n(h/t Toronto Star )\nMORE MLB: Want stories delivered to you?
