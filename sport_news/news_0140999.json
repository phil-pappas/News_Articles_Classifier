Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Despite De'Veon Smith's unclear status, Maryland is prepared for a bruising Michigan rushing attack. \nWith a rainy, windy day forecast for Saturday because of Hurricane Joaquin, Maryland and Michigan could be forced to take the ball out of their quarterbacks’ hands and place it firmly in the bellies of their running backs. \nAnd that puts the Terps’ focus squarely on Wolverines running back De’Veon Smith, the bruising runner who made a home on highlight reels in Michigan’s 31-0 win over BYU after a 60-yard touchdown run in which he disappeared into a mess of bodies at the line, only to reappear downfield and shake off a defender. \nThough Smith’s status is uncertain due to a foot/ankle injury he suffered in the victory, the Terps are preparing for any of the Michigan running backs like they would for Smith. \n“We have to gang tackle,” middle linebacker Jermaine Carter Jr. said Wednesday. “We have to come in there, everybody has to swarm to the ball. If everybody's swarming to the ball and more than one guy's hitting him, he shouldn't be able to break out and do things like that. We just have to come out there and hit him before they hit us in the mouth.” \nSmith has made progress this week and returned to practice, and offensive coordinator Tim Drevno \"implied\" to reporters that he expects Smith to play. impending inclement weather from Hurricane Joaquin , the school announced Thursday.\nThe game was scheduled to be a nationally televised night game on the Big Ten Network.

Maryland had been billing the game as a... (Daniel Gallen) \nThis season, Smith has rushed 69 times for 331 yards and four touchdowns. He has two 100-yard rushing games this season, and at 5-foot-11, 228 pounds, he’s a bruising back. \n“He's a very good back,” coach Randy Edsall said. “He's strong. He's powerful. He's got good vision. … It's all about playing low. It's all about taking care of your gap. It's about getting off blocks. It's about running to the football. Those are the things you have to do in order to stop the run, which they do a really good job at.” \nEven if Smith, a junior, can’t play, there’s plenty of talent behind him in the Big Ten Conference’s fifth-best rushing offense that’s averaging 202.2 yards per game. Junior Derrick Green was averaging 5.7 yards per carry a year ago before he suffered a season-ending injury, junior Ty Isaac is a former five-star recruit who transferred from Southern Cal and senior Drake Johnson averaged six yards per carry last season.

You just can't let people run by you.” \nMaryland is ranked last in the Big Ten in rushing defense and has allowed 200.2 yards per game on the ground. In last week’s 45-6 loss to West Virginia, the Mountaineers rushed 59 times for 304 yards, an average of 5.2 yards per carry. \nMichigan offers a little bit of a different wrinkle, though. Under coach Jim Harbaugh, the Wolverines are a straight-ahead power running team, much different from the attack the Terps faced a year ago with former Michigan quarterback Devin Gardner executing spread elements. So far, most of the running games Maryland has seen have been out of the shotgun in spread schemes. \nCarter said he enjoys playing “downhill” against the run, and that’s what he’s expecting to see from Michigan on Saturday. Ashiru said the execution of an offense and the players in an offense matter more than the type of offense it is. Nearly any offense executed well has the potential to rack up yards and score points. \n“Pro style, nowadays, people see it as old school,” Ashiru said. “But if you run it how you're supposed to run it, if you're well-coached how these guys are coached, it's an exciting offense to go up against. It's the same keys. We just got to do our jobs, fill our gaps and stop the run.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:36:29.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
