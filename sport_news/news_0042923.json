Doe has rubbished the electoral process that saw his contender, Roy Arthur, elected as the region's new chair. \nArthur, a former CEO of BA United, secured 26 votes to beat Doe, who had 24 out of the total votes cast on Thursday. \nDoe was seeking for an EIGHTH term in office as representive of the region on the Ghana Football Association Executive committee. Now he says the electoral process was flawed. \n“The same people who nominated me also nominated Roy Arthur. I never saw the form and I even accosted the election committee chairman that it is improper for somebody to file in Accra when the elections are conducted in Cape Coast.” \n“It is also improper for somebody to go into an election not knowing the details of documents submitted by a candidate for that election. Roy is not a qualified candidate and for me he is not a worthy winner. We must maintain the sanctity of our regulations.” \nDoe then blamed the GFA’s Election Committee for his shocking defeat. \n“The process itself was flawed with all manner of irregularities. Oguaa United, a member of the association wrote to the GFA and the association never had the courtesy to respond to its letter. [They] followed it [up] and nothing came.” \nMNS Doe has hinted he will to go to court to prove that Roy Arthur was not qualified to stand for elections in the Central Region. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
