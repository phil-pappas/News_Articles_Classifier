Shazier had practiced earlier in the week and was hopeful to return against the Chargers (2-2). He injured the shoulder in a Week 2 win against San Francisco, a game in which Shazier had a team-high 15 tackles with a sack and a fumble recovery. \nShazier has now missed 10 of 21 games since the Steelers took him in the first round of the 2014 draft. Sean Spence will start in his place against San Diego. \nCornerback Cortez Allen (knee) is questions for Pittsburgh (2-2). \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:57:49.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
