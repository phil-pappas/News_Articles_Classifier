Plans call for a supermarket, drugstore and restaurants. , SANDRA STOKLEY, FILE PHOTO Related article » More than three years after the Pedley Crossings proposal was first floated, the much-debated shopping center project has been given the green light.\nThe Jurupa Valley City Council’s Thursday, Oct. 15 vote was 4-0. City Councilwoman Laura Roughton was absent because of a family emergency.\nCity Councilman Verne Lauritzen said developers will turn a blighted, trash-strewn 30-acre property into a badly needed shopping center with the potential to generate significant sales tax revenue for the city.\n“This is a good project,” he said.\nAs it has over the past three years, the project – which will be at the southeast corner of Pedley Road and Highway 60 – generated plenty of debate during a public hearing that ran for more than an hour.\nRaymond Geiger, a resident of the Bravo Community mobile home park across the street from the site, called Pedley Crossings “a great idea” for the city.\nBut resident Gary Dell’Osso expressed concerns about the impact of blasting to remove two small hills on the property.\nPlans call for 265,978-square-feet of retail commercial area, including a 95,513-square-foot supermarket, a drugstore, fast food and sit-down restaurants and a gas station with a convenience store.\nTo prepare for construction, developer Realty Bancorp Equities must remove the two hills. That will require blasting about once a week, up to 100 times and operating a rock crusher to pulverize the earth and rocks.\nHundreds of trucks a day will haul away much of the material, a city report states.\nThe blasting could degrade air quality and poses a potential danger to the neighborhood, Dell’Osso said. Diesel trucks carrying dirt and rocks away will foul the air and damage local streets, he said.\nCritics also have suggested that the developer could remove the two hills , sell the dirt, sand, rocks and granite for a profit and abandon the shopping center project.\nDouglas Jacobsen, of Realty Bancorp Equities, said the company is committed to completing Pedley Crossings.\nOther Inland shopping centers he has developed include the Sav-On Center in Corona, the Rancho Cucamonga Plaza and a shopping center in Norco on Hidden Valley Parkway at Interstate 15.\nAn agreement provides for up to $2 million in penalties that the developer must pay the city if specified milestones are not met in developing the project.\nJacobsen said Friday that work will begin on the project “as soon as I get the first signature from a corporate tenant.”\n“We’ve sent out the word we got a green light,” Jacobsen said.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9647 or sstokley@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc45b-b88542278z.120151016153435000gfeckki5.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc45b-b88542278z.120151016153435000gfeckki5.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:36:09.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
