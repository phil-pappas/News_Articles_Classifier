No. 6 Clemson stays perfect and hands Hurricanes worst-ever loss, 58-0 By TIM REYNOLDS AP Sports Writer   3:42   3:42   \nPeople: \nFlorida (987) \nMIAMI GARDENS, Florida â€” No. 6 Clemson handed Miami its worst defeat in the program's 90-year history Saturday, rolling to a 58-0 win to remain unbeaten. \nDeshaun Watson threw for a touchdown and ran for another, while Wayne Gallman rushed for 118 yards and a touchdown for the Tigers (7-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). \nStacy Coley had eight catches for 54 yards for Miami (4-3, 1-2), in a game that could doom whatever chance Hurricanes coach Al Golden had of keeping his job much longer. There was booing and a \"Fire Golden\" chant from the sparse crowd even before the first quarter ended, and the stands were largely empty by the midpoint of the third quarter. \nUntil Saturday, the worst loss in Miami history was a 70-14 defeat to Texas A&M on Dec. 8, 1944. It was Clemson's largest win over an FBS opponent since an 82-24 win over Wake Forest on Oct. 31, 1981. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:44:54.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
