(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) \nNEW YORK — Among the moments when the 2015 Washington Nationals season pivoted was the trade deadline, when the Nationals added Jonathan Papelbon and no one else, while the Mets added Tyler Clippard, Juan Uribe, and Yoenis Cespedes. While well-stocked contenders around them dealt for bigger names to bolster already strong rosters, Mike Rizzo and the Nationals stood pat, for the most part, believing in the players they had, that injured Anthony Rendon, Ryan Zimmerman and Jayson Werth would add plenty, free of charge. \n“I think the Mets made a lot of great moves, there’s no doubt about it. They got the most impactful player at the deadline in Cespedes, who is a great player,” Rizzo said. “We thought the roster that we had and the players that we had coming off the disabled list was enough to get us through. Obviously, we were wrong in that assessment, just because the guys we did have come back weren’t in playoff type of mode, they were more in spring training type of mode.” \n[ From July: Jerry Brewer explains why Nats should be active at trade deadline ] \nAnthony Rendon, Jayson Werth and Ryan Zimmerman returned from injury in late July but produced inconsistently in the second half. Rendon hit .263 with limited power in August and September. Werth hit .230 when he returned, though he did produce in late August and early September when he replaced Denard Span in the leadoff spot and hit 10 home runs in 226 at-bats — on pace for more than 20 homers over the course of the full season. Zimmerman heated up in late August, then hit .462 in six September games before an oblique strain forced him out of the lineup for the rest of the season. He hit 10 home runs in 35 games in August and September, strong power production the Nationals needed to back up Bryce Harper all season. With Span lost for most of the second half, the Nationals never adopted the form Rizzo intended — the lineup he built, then waited for through the first half, played two games intact. \n“Obviously, the injuries are the one thing that sticks out,” said Werth, wondering why the Nationals did not fare better down the stretch. “We didn’t win games. You look at what the Mets did down the stretch. That’s how you win a division: Timely hitting, timely pitching, they matched up well, they won big games, they got big hits. We didn’t do that. So regardless of injuries or anything else, I think that’s the story at the end of the day.” \nThroughout the ups and downs of this season, Rizzo maintained his stance that the roster was built to win, but didn’t — and the expectations piled on his roster back his point. But injuries changed everything and the Nationals, still leading the division at the deadline, changed very little that day. \n“Congratulations to the New York Mets,” Rizzo said before Sunday’s game. “They played extremely well down the stretch, and we played extremely poorly. So they’re now the king of the National League East, and our job in 2016 is to dethrone them and take back the division.” \nIN THE POST \nThe Nationals fell to the Mets, 1-0, on the final day of a lost season. \nIN THE JOURNAL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:49:41.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
