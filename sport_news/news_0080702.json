And do both so well the quarterback need not be of the franchise variety? In fact, he could even be of the 1-10 2014 record variety?\nThey didn't consistently do either in Sunday's first half and trailed 14-9 at halftime. If Baltimore adds to the lead to start the second half, McCown will have to do more, which is not a great idea judging by his tendency to throw the ball up for grabs at times.\nHe got lucky once when an interception was nullified by a stupid roughing the passer penalty. But otherwise, he was the offense.\nThe Browns settled for three field goals in the first half, two after drives stalled in the red zone. It would help immensely if they could run the ball inside the 20 (or anywhere else) to keep the Ravens' defense honest.\nTheir first-down offense is terrible. That wouldn't be such an issue if McCown were Joe Flacco. As it was, he was better than you have a right to expect on third downs (just not inside the 20).\nBut an afternoon of asking McCown to produce in the face of a strong Baltimore rush let loose on obvious passing downs is a recipe for disaster.\nA week ago McCown matched Philip Rivers, almost drive for drive. He's been better than advertised.\nYou just can't can't keep asking him to do that. Mike Pettine said at halftime the Browns are a \"by any means necessary offense,\" and that the Ravens' are a tough front seven to run against.\nThe sign of a good running game is being able to move the chains on the ground when the other team knows you want to run it. The Browns haven't done that much this season.\nAs for the defense, Jim O'Neil's guys got off to a slow start but stiffened late in the second quarter. O'Neil called the NFL a \"execution league,\" which put the onus on Browns' veterans who questioned the base scheme picked apart by Rivers in San Diego.\nThe Browns' defense improved as Sunday's first half wore on. If that continues and McCown doesn't have to throw 40 times they might just steal one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:32:21.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
