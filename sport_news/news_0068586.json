Catania scored the Crusaders’ first goal. ELMWOOD PARK – Andrew Andrach and Nolan Van Rye figured Elmwood Park needed some kind of big play to turn the game back in their team’s direction. So a perfectly timed give-and-go between the two of them gave Elmwood Park a late goal and helped the Crusaders to a 3-1 victory over Glen Rock in an NJIC Colonial Division boys soccer game Monday.\nAfter dominating the first half and surging to a two-goal advantage, Elmwood Park sat back in the first part of the final 40 minutes as Glen Rock cut its deficit in half and was making serious threats to at least even the score. But Andrach, a junior midfielder, put in a long throw-in to Van Rye, who crossed it back to Andrach cutting across the middle, and he kicked it in from 10 yards away to put Elmwood Park safely up by two with 11:42 remaining.\n\"That really gave us some important insurance; they were coming on a bit and we needed to stop their rally,\" said Van Rye. \"We just wanted to stabilize the situation.\"\nElmwood Park (9-6-1), which has gone 6-2-1 in its past nine games, came out firing on all cylinders.\nThe Crusaders tested Glen Rock goalie Luke Fisher with several deep blasts before sophomore forward Franco Catania took a well-timed pass from junior defender Dejan Koskoski and buried it into the upper right-hand side of the net 15 minutes in to make it 1-0.\nThe Crusaders doubled their lead in the 31st minute. Junior forward Marcus Picinich, returning from a bone bruise in his right calf, boomed in a shot from 20 feet away off an assist from senior midfielder Alejandro Rada to make it 2-0, and that’s the way it stayed until intermission.\nBut Glen Rock (6-8) came out and won most of the 50-50 balls and assumed the time-of-possession edge early in the final half. The pressure paid off when Panthers senior midfielder Liam Geduldig took a feed from senior forward Eamon Morley and scored. Glen Rock applied more pressure after that, but Elmwood Park junior goalkeeper Christian Andrach (five saves) was equal to the task.\nThe short-handed Panthers, missing senior sweeper Alex Hay (sick) and senior outside back Ben Milbrodt (concussion), mounted a serious challenge.\n\"We talked at the break that we were a little disjointed in the first half and we had to come out with a lot more energy to give ourselves an opportunity,\" said Glen Rock coach Paul Cusack. \"That’s what we did and we came close to tying it a couple of times before their late goal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:47:27.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
