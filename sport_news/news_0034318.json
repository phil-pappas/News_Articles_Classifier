Whitecwhite@mdjonline.com The Marietta Daily Journal  27 AM | 731 views | 0 | 3 | | With four weeks remaining in the regular season, opportunities remain for playoff hopefuls to show that they can be a contender.One team that has done just that is Allatoona. Questions abounded when the Buccaneers lost their first game of the season to East Paulding, and there were doubts they would be able to defend their Region 5 championship.The questions have seemingly disappeared following Allatoona’s six-game win streak, which includes victories over South Paulding, Alexander and New Manchester. The Buccaneers got off to slow starts in each game, but turned things around in the second half to get the win.“It could be good coaching at halftime or bad coaching during the week,” Allatoona coach Gary Varner said of his team’s slow starts. “Playing some good teams, I think, has a lot to do with it. The kids are focused when they come out and adjust well to the game plan. We could probably do a better job during the week to get them ready, but, overall, we’re definitely happy with the streak,”McEachern’s 35-0 win over North Cobb gave even more credence to the Indians’ claim as a contender as they leapfrogged the Warriors atop the Region 4 standings with an unblemished region mark.North Cobb remains a contender, too, despite its setback and sub-.500 overall record. The Warriors have a favorable schedule down the stretch.Another contending squad is Mount Paran Christian. The Eagles, who have won six in a row and 20 straight dating back to last season, have a challenging upcoming schedule, but not one they cannot overcome.Hillgrove’s 55-35 victory over North Paulding kept the Hawks in the postseason discussion, though it finishes the season against Kennesaw Mountain, Harrison and McEachern.Harrison’s 41-14 win over Kennesaw Mountain kept it in the playoff hunt. Four spots are up for grabs in Region 4 , and McEachern, North Cobb, Harrison and Hillgrove all have the inside track.South Cobb’s playoff hopes in Region 3 took a hit after the Eagles lost 40-15 to winless Douglas County. Pebblebrook’s 27-6 win over Campbell breathed new life for the Falcons, while simultaneously dooming the Spartans. Pebblebrook, which still has region contenders East Coweta, Newnan and Langston Hughes on its schedule, may need to pull at least one upset to advance.Walton put its postseason hopes back on track with a convincing 49-10 win over Pope in Region 5 . The Raiders quickly overcame their previous loss at Roswell and are showing no signs of giving up.“The guys were deflated (after the Roswell loss),” Walton coach Mo Dixon said. “It didn’t come down to a last-minute or heart-breaking loss. We were manhandled. This week, we went against a young (Pope) team that was hungry, so it was like two extremes. We came out against Pope just making sure we knew what to do and doing what we were supposed to do.”Wheeler, on the other hand, showed promise as a playoff contender early, but three consecutive Region 5 losses, including a 45-7 setback against Roswell, have the Wildcats looking like the odd team out if they don’t turn things around.Sprayberry is in a similar situation after dropping a 42-17 game to Cambridge. The Yellow Jackets started 2-0 in Region 7 (B), but have since lost two straight, and their margin for error is slim with two subregion games remaining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:35:42.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
