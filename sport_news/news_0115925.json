(Tony Ding / AP) Teddy Greenstein's Big Ten awards and demerits at the season's halfway point. \nOne coach got fired. Another was suspended. \nThe coach of the nation's top-ranked team employs a new quarterback strategy every week. \nAnd one is giving credence to the axiom, \"Nice guys finish last.\" \nCoaches have been front and center in this Big Ten season, but let's shine a spotlight on the entire league in these midseason awards: \nTop performances, by the numbers: \n0: Number of points Michigan has allowed in its last three games while outscoring BYU, Maryland and Northwestern 97-0. Tack on Oregon State and UNLV, and the margin is 160-14. \n43: Iowa's Jordan Canzeri rushed a school-record 43 times against Illinois, which Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald called \"unheard of in today's day and age.\" \n3.5: Wisconsin linebacker Joe Schobert didn't do much in the Iowa game except record 31/2 tackles for a loss, force two fumbles, recover one and hurry the quarterback five times. \n274: Ezekiel Elliott bailed out Ohio State against Indiana when he rushed for 274 yards and three scores. \n19: Northwestern's Anthony Walker had five tackles in the second half at Duke — and 14 before halftime. \n233: Will Likely provided Maryland's only bright spot as he broke Nile Kinnick's 1939 conference record for punt-return yardage in a game for Iowa. \nTop Tribune Silver Football candidates: The coaches vote on the award that goes to the Big Ten's best player, so this is merely an educated guess based on the statistical leaders: \nElliott: Keeps trucking (league-high 835 rushing yards) despite the switcheroos at quarterback. \nIowa quarterback C.J. Beathard: His moxie and scrambling ability are big contributors to Iowa's rise to 6-0. \nMichigan State quarterback Connor Cook: Sub-60 percent completion rate (due in part to erratic receivers), but if the Spartans keep winning … \nOhio State quarterback Cardale Jones: Buckeyes close with Michigan State and Michigan, allowing him to all but wipe away the early-season struggles. \nCanzeri: Lightly recruited prospect from New York was second to LeShun Daniels on the depth chart to start the season. \nBest skill players who won't take the Silver: Rutgers receiver Leonte Carroo: Missed two games to suspension and plays for a mediocre team. But just ask Michigan State (seven catches, 134 yards, three touchdowns) how dangerous he is. \nOhio State receiver Braxton Miller: Two-time winner has been more of a pawn than a rook in the Buckeyes offense. \nMichigan return man/safety Jabrill Peppers: Needs to break off some big-time punt returns before elevating him to Charles Woodson status. \nToughest nut to crack: Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh would have made a hell of a lawyer. He answers questions literally, giving no information unless specifically asked. And even then, he often will take a pass. \nReporter: \"Do you have a social-media policy for your players?\" \nHarbaugh: \"Yes.\" \nAwkward pause. \nHarbaugh was asked Tuesday about his formula for rejuvenating programs, such as at San Diego, Stanford and now Michigan. \n\"First I'd correct you,\" Harbaugh said. \"You made it sound like it's some kind of personal accomplishment. We win as a team.\" \nCoach of the year: \nHarbaugh: The beauty is that he resurrects programs without gimmicks. It's all about blocking and tackling. \nIowa's Kirk Ferentz: He laughs off \"the legend of new Kirk,\" but his new risk-embracing mindset is no joke. \nFitzgerald: Has his players believing that back-to-back 5-7 seasons were the outliers, not the norm. \nIllinois' Bill Cubit: Has stabilized a program previously known for embarrassing gaffes on the sidelines and at the podium. \nMichigan State's Mark Dantonio: The Spartans walk a tightrope each week but keep making it to the other side despite a mess of injuries. \nLeadership optional: The 1-2 punch that ended Randy Edsall's unremarkable run at Maryland came when he got smoked by rival West Virginia and then had to be informed by a media member that his Terrapins had gathered for a players-only meeting. \nRutgers' Kyle Flood actually thought it wise (at the time) to email and meet with a professor regarding a grade change of a player who caused almost nothing but trouble. \nNebraska's gentlemanly Mike Riley flubbed late-game strategy against BYU and Illinois. And those are just two of the Huskers' four excruciating defeats. \nExtra points: Iowa standout defensive end Drew Ott has a season-ending ACL tear and hip/groin injuries might limit Beathard's mobility at Northwestern. Beathard declined to tell Iowa reporters if he's full-go in practice this week but called the ailment \"nothing serious.\"… Maryland's Mike Locksley, promoted from offensive coordinator to interim head coach after Edsall's firing, likened himself to a \"substitute school teacher. … It has been a whirlwind for all parties involved. The focus needs to be on the players.\"… Flood called it \"a helpless kind of feeling\" as he watched Rutgers games on TV during his three-game suspension. He returns to the sidelines Saturday. … Penn State's James Franklin said the decision on star tailback Saquon Barkley (ankle) will be left to the trainers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:45:32.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
