Beltran’s eight homers with the Astros in 2004 came over 56 plate appearances for the best ratio among the leaders. Murphy will enter play against the Royals with only 39 plate appearances.\nBut don’t count Murphy among those caught up in the hoopla of his historic postseason. Asked recently what planet he’s on, Murphy responded, “Planet Earth.”\nMurphy hit a career-high 14 homers in the regular season and has gotten halfway to that number in nine postseason games.\nIn that game in Atlanta on Sept. 13, Murphy’s three-run blast tied the score in the ninth before the Mets scored three times in the 10th to win 10-7. Murphy later admitted he was trying for a home run — for one of the few times in his career — when he hit the ninth-inning blast. \nIt’s that kind of aggressive approach that Alderson has noticed over the last two-to-three months from Murphy.\n“A lot less going the other way and a lot more damage up the middle and on the pull side, and I think that’s a function of his approach,” Alderson said. “He’s always been great mechanically as a hitter, and he’s made some adjustments with the help of the coaching staff. That doesn’t explain the last six or seven games, but it does explain a general trend of his at the plate over the last couple of months.”\nMurphy and Kevin Long after the Mets won the NLCS.

It started with an email that Long — who was hired last October — sent to Murphy last winter.\n“[Long] had broken down everybody’s swing, I think that was going into spring training,” Murphy said. “So when you have somebody in the offseason who has gone through that much film to prepare himself to get to know you to prepare himself for spring training for the season, I feel like you almost have no choice automatically but to just buy in because you know he’s buying in and he’s all-in.”\nMurphy said a simple change in mechanics started the transformation.\n“He sent me some video about, ‘I think you can use your legs a little more, you put your foot down, you’re late,’ ” Murphy said. “I said, ‘This guy is talking my language, because I have been. I’ve spent my entire career late to the ball.’\n“So it really was a great starting of a relationship between me and him personally, and we were talking the same language, and then you see how prepared he was and the preparation he puts in and when I go down to the cage and ask him about the Royals bullpen, I know he’s going to have all the answers to my questions, and there’s a level of peace to that.”\n  daniel murphy ,  kevin long ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:03:28.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
