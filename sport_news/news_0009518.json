It was not clear which specific drug the caller was referring to.A helicopter landed at 4:37 p.m. to take Odom to the hospital, but he couldn't fit on the aircraft. Accompanied by a nurse, he arrived at the hospital at 5:30 p.m. Officials said his level of care was not diminished.Reps for Odom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Odom, 35, had been staying at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada for a few days before his hospitalization Tuesday. After receiving treatment at Pahrump's Desert View Hospital, he was transferred to another hospital in Las Vegas, where he remains.\"He is in a real difficult situation,\" Rev. Jesse Jackson said Wednesday. \"We can only at this time, pray for his recovery...the doctors will have to give you the medical language.\"Odom's ex-wife, Khloe Kardashian, remains by his bedside, and her mother, Kris Jenner, has also been seen at the hospital. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
