Last year’s 29-28 Barstow victory came at a raucous and packed Langworthy Field. The 2015 edition was held at Ray Moore Stadium in Victorville, but the Barstow contingent was nearly as large and just as noisy. Between chants of “Bar-stow, Bar-stow” and good-natured taunting of anyone not wearing red and white, the fans made their presence known at the annual rivalry game. This year’s 39-14 victory wasn’t the taut thriller that 2014’s was, but you wouldn’t be able to tell by looking at the Barstow sideline or bleachers. After the game head coach Ray Silva seemed as much relieved as he did happy. He breathed a long exhale of relief after speaking to his players, finally getting something resembling a break after a long, hard week of practice. Barstow saves something a little extra for the Axe Game. Last year it was going for two points when down by one at the end to take the win instead of playing for overtime. This year it was a fake punt turned 13-yard rush for Jordon Londo. “You’ve got to take chances in a game like this,” said Silva. “We’ve been working on that all season.” At the time of the fake punt, with time winding down in the first quarter and the game scoreless, the boldness seemed necessary. In the end, Barstow won in a rout. The defensive line wasn’t so much a wall as it was an avalanche. Victor Valley quarterback Justin Ortiz had no sooner caught a snap than he was rolling out to his left or right to avoid the onslaught of Barstow defenders. Ezra Paopao burst his way into the backfield with the ferocious speed he’s become known for in Barstow. When it wasn’t Paopao, it was someone else, often multiple someones, pressuring the Victor Valley quarterback. Friday’s win was Barstow’s biggest in an Axe Game since 2007 when the Aztecs beat Victor Valley 54-20 behind five touchdowns from sophomore Curtis Webb, who went on to finish his high school career with 38 touchdowns and 3,045 yards over 36 games in three varsity seasons. Brandon Pierce is building a similar pedigree. The running back is up to 2,843 rushing yards and 28 touchdowns in 26 varsity games after scoring twice on Friday. That portion of the formula hasn’t changed much for Barstow. A collection of powerful backs plowing through defenses thanks to excellent line play is part of Barstow’s DNA. The strength of the line play extends to its defense, which made work relatively easy for the secondary against the Jackrabbits. Barstow entered Friday’s game tied for fourth in the Eastern Division with 16 sacks. Paopao was tied for 30th in California with eight. “It’s just simple plays we have on defense,” said Paopao of Barstow’s ability to get through Victor Valley’s offensive line so quickly. “For me personally, it’s just my speed. That’s my role, you know? Just getting back there.” Despite being burned on two big plays that wound up being touchdowns, Barstow’s defensive backs played as well as they have all season after a grueling week of practice. Every blown coverage during practice meant running laps, not that the Barstow defense needed much extra incentive. “It’s always a big deal here. Everybody is talking about it” said Paopao before Friday’s game. “We don’t want to lose this.” It’s the Axe Game. In Barstow, that’s motivation enough.
