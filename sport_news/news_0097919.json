But Quintana's teammates couldn't help get him there. \nEric Hosmer hit a go-ahead two-run homer in the 10th inning, and the Kansas City Royals beat the White Sox 5-3 to clinch home-field advantage in an AL Division Series. \nBen Zobrist singled with one out, and Hosmer drove a pitch from David Robertson (6-5) into the bullpen in right field to give the Royals the lead. Chicago then went quietly in the 10th. \nQuintana's consistency against the Royals was again a staple. Despite that, Quintana remained winless since Sept. 12 despite allowing three runs and five hits over his nine innings. \n\"It comes down to we don't score enough for him,\" White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. \"That's pretty obvious.\" \nQuintana became the first White Sox pitcher to throw 200-plus innings, make 30 or more starts and strike out at least 160 hitters in three straight years since Javier Vazquez in 2006-08. \nQuintana was hoping to add a 10th victory his accomplishments and did his job, throwing strikes on 71.8 percent of his pitches in Wednesday's no-decision. \n\"My point is to try to get as many wins as you can for the team,\" Quintana said. \"Everything is about the team. I'll try to keep going. The season is done for me right now, but I'll try to focus on the next season.\" \nAlex Gordon and Mike Moustakas also homered for Kansas City, which had already clinched the AL Central title. \n\"To have the first round at least at home is definitely big for us,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \nThe win was a painful one for Kansas City. In the seventh, Lorenzo Cain fouled a pitch from Quintana off his right knee. He remained in the game and grounded out to third but he didn't make it to first and was replaced in the bottom of the inning. \nThe Royals said Cain has a right knee contusion and is day-to-day. \nEdinson Volquez went six innings, allowed one run and nine hits while striking out five but couldn't pick up his first win since Sept. 8. Franklin Morales (4-2) pitched a scoreless inning in relief and Wade Davis picked up his 15th save in 16 tries. \nChicago gave Quintana a 1-0 lead in the second on Adam Eaton's run-scoring single. The White Sox had three singles off Volquez in the first and three more in the second but only scored one run. \nGordon led off the third with his 13th home run over the fence in deep left-center field. Moustakas' two-run homer in the sixth gave Kansas City a 3-1 lead. \nJose Abreu hit his 30th homer in the seventh for Chicago to pull within 3-2. In the eighth, Chicago tied the game with a double by Tyler Flowers when his drive to right off Kelvin Herrera went over Paulo Orlando's head and bounced over the wall, bringing in Tyler Saladino. \nFlowers had four hits for the White Sox to match a career high. \nBut it didn't add up to the elusive 10th win the White Sox were hoping to get Quintana after Hosmer's homer off Robertson. \n\"It's unfortunate,\" Robertson said. \"I wish I would have been better at my job so that he had 10 wins but, his innings, his ERA, strikeouts, walks, everything shows he's a quality pitcher and he gets the job done.\" \nCHOICE COMPANY \nWith his home run Wednesday, Abreu joined Albert Pujols (2001-02) and Ryan Braun (2007-08) as the only players in baseball history to hit 30 or more home runs in each of their first two seasons. \"He was pretty happy with his home run and he should be,\" Ventura said. \"Anytime you start saying there's only one other guy that's done something, it's impressive.\" \nMR. VERSATILE \nTrayce Thompson started in right field for the White Sox. Since joining the team, Thompson has played all three outfield positions, but said Wednesday he's a center fielder. \n\"I still try to work on that in that batting practice even if I'm playing left field, I still make sure to go out and get my jumps in center and stuff,\" Thompson said. \"But I'll go wherever they tell me, wherever can help me get in the lineup. \n\"I know it's a challenge for me to go back and forth and what not but if anyone is up for the challenge or up for the work it's me.\" \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nRoyals: OF Jarrod Dyson replaced Cain in center field. \nWhite Sox: INF Micah Johnson will have surgery on his left knee Thursday. Ventura said he didn't have a timetable for when Johnson would return to baseball activities. \"It's not that big a deal but it's enough to go in and fix it,\" Ventura said. \nUP NEXT \nKansas City RHP Kris Medlen (5-2, 4.30) faces Chicago LHP John Danks (7-14, 4.53). Medlen is 4-0 with a 1.13 ERA in three starts and eight outings on the road in 2015. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:45:19.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
