The schools generated more than 1,000 cans of food for donation. \nThe contributions will help replenish the county food bank’s shelves so that it can continue to provide assistance to all county residents in need. \nApproximately 80 food pantries and soup kitchens throughout the county are in the M.C.F.O.O.D.S. network, which also works in conjunction with 25 additional agencies including residential facilities, shelters, social service agencies, programs for women and children, senior citizen housing facilities and other outreach services. \nCollectively, the agencies reach a variety of people county-wide including low-income families, homeless, people with disabilities or mental and physical challenges, children and senior citizens. \nTo learn more about sponsoring a food drive, visit www.mciauth.com. 3 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1S0zPD7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:52:39.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
