Nitin Yadav, Managing Director of the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam and the UHBVN, said here today that the decision had been taken keeping in view the general complaints about getting inflated bills. Even as there was uproar in the state against “inflated bills”, Yadav claimed a slight increase in power tariff of various categories for 2015-16 was announced in the order of the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) on May 7, which was applicable from April 1. “This increased tariff accumulated as arrears could not be levied in previous bills, and has to be recovered in the current energy bills,” he asserted. He stated that it was for the first time that a special category had been created for the economically weaker sections of society, with consumers having consumption less than 50 units. The tariff for this category was at very subsidised rate of Rs 2.85 per unit, as compared to the cost of supply of Rs 7.34 per unit. Under this category, more than 20 lakh consumers had been benefited throughout the state. Moreover, this tariff was much less than the neighbouring states— Rs 5.25 per unit in Delhi and Rs 5.21 per unit in Punjab. For the other categories of consumers, including HT and LT industries, there was an average increase of about 8.5 per cent in power tariff, which was again lower than that in the neighbouring states. In the commercial category, the power tariff is Rs 6.20 for up to 100 units (Rs 9.59 in Delhi and Rs 7.48 in Punjab. Likewise, in the case of consumption of up to 500 units, the power tariff in Haryana was Rs 6.20 (Rs 9.59 per unit in Delhi and Rs 7.68 per unit in Punjab). Meanwhile, the Haryana Discoms have established around 246 special electricity bill counters in the state to redress the complaints relating to power bills . The consumers can get their bills re-verified within three days at these counters located in the subdivisional offices concerned. Inflated bills anger power consumers Fatehabad: Highly inflated power bills sent by Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam to consumers this month have angered residents here. Those affected alleged the bills were 50 - 70 per cent higher than what they normally receive. Showing his domestic power supply bill, Dr HC Dahiya, a local physician, said he got a bill of Rs 23,176 for two months against his usual bill of Rs 11,000 to Rs 12,000. Given that the consumption was 2,328 units during this period, we have been charged at almost Rs 10 per unit. Similarly, the non-domestic bill of Rs 17,288 he has received for consuming 1,659 units in one month in his hospital is costing him more than Rs 10 per unit. Similar complaints were made by several other consumers in the town. Sources said the DHBVN had increased power tariff and fuel surcharge from April this year making power costlier by 50 - 70 per cent for consumers using 500 or more units per month. — Sushil Manav", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:19:23.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
