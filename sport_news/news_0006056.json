After tweaking his hamstring, he came back to draw a huge pass interference flag, played the decoy on the winning score — then choked up after the 30-27 win over San Francisco.\n“It seems like we’re always counted out, things don’t always go our way,’’ Beckham said when asked why he had gotten so emotional. “In the past we’ve made these mistakes and they say history is doomed to repeat itself. It was great to be able to see this team and the fans just light the stadium up, they lit the stadium up and gave us the energy we needed to be able to go down there and score.”\nBeckham, the man Jets corner Antonio Cromartie labeled a one-year wonder, had seven catches for 121 yards and a touchdown. He hurt his hamstring five or six plays before his scoring catch and played through it before leaving the game. But he refused to stay on the sideline and miss the crucial drive.\n“This is what I love,” said Beckham, convinced his injury won’t be a major one. “This is my passion, my everything: There’s no way in a moment like that that you can’t step up. I feel like I let the team down by being out for awhile, just got to put it all together man. God gave me the strength.\n“You’re never happy with it, but I’m happy it is what it is. It won’t be long at all.’’\nAfter Beckham had spun past cornerback Kenneth Acker on his touchdown, and briefly left the game, he came back to draw to draw a huge pass-interference penalty on Acker the last drive. One play later, Eli Manning hit tight end Larry Donnell in the back of the end zone for a score with :21 left.\n“It was on the last drive. I love doing this. I love football,” Beckham said. “And there’s no way you can’t be part of moments like that. That’s what you play for, 27-23 you’re down and you’ve got to go score the winning drive.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under new york giants ,  odell beckham jr.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:19:55.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
