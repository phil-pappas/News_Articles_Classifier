We truly are a family and we've built a great brotherhood in here.\"\nA crowd much smaller than the announced 40,000 braved a wet, chilly evening to see the Yankees post the win that clinched a wild card berth.\nRodriguez did not supply a home run, leaving that to Carlos Beltran and late-season rookie call-ups Greg Bird and Rob Refsnyder, while Rodriguez had a walk and single.\nBut it was A-Rod's hitting this season that helped drive the team to the playoffs.\nReturning after a one-season ban for violating MLB's drug program, Rodriguez belted 33 home runs and drove in 86 runs in New York's drive back to the playoffs.\n\"For Alex to come in and have the year that he had this year was outstanding and it was a big lift for us,\" said manager Joe Girardi.\n\"I think it's extremely gratifying with what we've went through this year, where people figured we would be at the end of the year.\n\"We had a lot of injuries, we had age on this team. But they always kept fighting.\"\nAlong the way, Rodriguez achieved a clutch of milestones.\nHe became the 29th player to amass 3,000 hits and rose to fourth on the all-time home run list behind Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth.\nIn 2013, Rodriguez hit just seven home runs and drove in 19 in 44 games after a late start following hip surgery.\nRodriguez, who had admitted before the 2009 season that he used steroids while with the Texas Rangers after receiving a record 10-year, $250 million deal, was called A-Roid and A-Fraud in the tabloids and from the stands.\nNow he has been embraced as a model of redemption by Yankees fans and on Thursday was announced as a finalist for the Comeback Player of the Year award given by the Players Association.\n\"I do take a minute to feel extremely grateful for the opportunity that I've gotten,\" Rodriguez said.\n\"In January, honestly, my number one goal was to make the team and they gave me an opportunity and I'm thankful for it.\"\n(Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:16:17.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
