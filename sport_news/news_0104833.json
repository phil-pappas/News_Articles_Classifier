But once the Kompas got to the state’s highest level, the struggles dissipated.\nThe Kompa sisters completed a run of four consecutive straight-set wins with a 6-2, 6-0 victory on Saturday over Delaney and Steer in the championship match.\n“The shoulder (issue) has been going on for three years,” Olivia said. “I did (physical therapy) on it for three years, so I’ve been serving underhanded on and off. Some people can pick it up, but sometimes it’s really effective. This was a positive way to end my tennis career.\n“It was a good experience to do it with my sister.”\nPaige struggled to come up with the right adjective to describe what it felt like to win a state title as a freshman.\n“It’s crazy,” she said. “I guess it’ll sink in tomorrow. I’m glad I got to do it with my sister.\"\nUA senior Kyra Jung, who won the doubles title last year, and junior Anna Marie Reynolds finished third.\nOn Saturday, the Kompas beat Jung and Reynolds 6-3, 6-1 in a semifinal matchup of teammates.\n“They both had different roads to get here, and obviously you want to get two teams as close as you can to the title,” UA coach Shaun Stamps said. “(The Kompas) were a little more consistent.\"\nDelaney and Steer, who became the first players from Liberty to reach a state final in girls tennis, beat Cincinnati Ursuline Academy’s Jenny Duma and Gabriella O’Connor 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 in a semifinal.\n“We’ve played a lot of really good teams and have a lot of experience,” Liberty coach Meaghan Colville said. “This was nothing new for them.”\nJung and Reynolds beat Duma and O’Connor 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 in the consolation match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:20:02.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
