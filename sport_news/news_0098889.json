One week it’s dark, stormy and pretty much falling, the next it’s bright, blue and cloudless. Through five games, some have looked at the Bruins as something of a carbon copy of the sky. It’s an easy, obvious comparison – just not very accurate. The B’s weren’t doomed to be as poor a team as their 0-3 start made it look to so many, and two consecutive wins on the road last week don’t make them Stanley Cup contenders. The hysteria that accompained the 0-3 start, over which the Bruins allowed 16 goals, seems a bit silly today. The idea that a team with so many new players would break from the gate as a cohesive group, everyone on the same page, was fantasy. From No. 1 defenseman Zdeno Chara’s absence for the first two games, to the fact that the B’s faced three teams that qualified for the playoffs last year, to goalie Tuukka Rask’s career track record to that massive turnover from last April to this October, much was overlooked. Moving two key veterans into the rotation – Chara onto the blue line for about 24 minutes per game, and Chris Kelly up onto the previously porous third line, with Ryan Spooner and Jimmy Hayes, has steadied things. Timely saves by veteran goalies – Rask in Saturday’s 5-3 win at Arizona, new backup Jonas Gustavsson in last Wednesday’s 6-2 decision at Colorado – gave the B’s lifts that Rask admitted he hadn’t given his teammates during their three-game homestand. The surest way for the B’s to right themselves was to reduce their goals against, and for now, they’ve done it. All has not been ironed out, though. As encouraging as it has been to see the Bruins average 3.6 goals per game – a full goal better than last season’s 2.55 – virtually every line is struggling to score at even strength. Of their 18 goals, only nine have been scored in 5-on-5 situations. The issue is especially pronounced on David Krejci’s line, where neither winger (Matt Beleskey, David Pastrnak) has scored a point in the last three games, and on Spooner’s line, which had a big game at Colorado (he, Hayes and Kelly were a combined 3-4–7) but hasn’t produced otherwise. Spooner is minus-4 and Hayes minus-3; linemates Beleskey and Pastrnak are both minus-3. Coach Claude Julien is not averse to considering changes, even if they hurt feelings. Brett Connolly, for instance, did a relatively solid job with Patrice Bergeron and Loui Eriksson when their linemate, Brad Marchand, had to miss two games with a concussion. Because Kelly replaced Connolly so effectively with Spooner and Hayes, Connolly was left out of the lineup on Saturday, when Marchand returned and played his best game of the year. Page 2 of 2 - Whether some forwards find new homes by Wednesday’s home game against the Flyers remains to be seen, but it’s certain Julien won’t touch the power play. A major concern entering the season, after the departures of 2014-15 regulars Dougie Hamilton, Milan Lucic, Reilly Smith and Carl Soderberg, the B’s have instead formed what has so far been the NHL’s best power play (7 for 18, 38.9 percent). As a result, Krejci (2-3–5 on power plays) was tied for the NHL scoring lead with 9 points, and Krug’s five power-play assists helped him to second in scoring among defensemen, with 6 points. As much of a difference as a strong power play has made, the B’s can’t be so dependent on it (especially when their penalty-killers rank 26th in the NHL). They must improve at 5-on-5, with and without the puck, and that takes more than forwards. The Bruins have already used nine defensemen through five games, four of whom have played 30 career NHL games or fewer. So there’s still some sorting out to do now, and more lies ahead in a month or so, when Dennis Seidenberg is ready to return from back surgery. Consider all that, and it’s probably not best to think about the Bruins’ season in terms of what happens in the sky. Better, for now, to look at it like the roads around here: Expect bumps, and enjoy the smooth spots when you find them.
