She was among four people pleading guilty in the case Friday.\nAmong the allegations made by prosecutors were that Crinel instructed the staff of Abide Home Care Services not to discharge patients, even when they did not require home health services; and, she directed Abide to routinely file falsified diagnoses and medical records to inflate Medicare reimbursements.\nSentencing dates were set for January.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
