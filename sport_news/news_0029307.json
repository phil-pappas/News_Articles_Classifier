Rain forces key playoff race to Sunday 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Concord, N.C.\nThe opening race of the second round of NASCAR 's playoffs was washed out by persistent rain Saturday at Charlotte Motor Speedway .\nThe race was rescheduled for 12:30 p.m. Sunday.\nIt's just NASCAR's second rainout of the season, although several events this year were delayed because of weather.\nJoe Gibbs Racing headed into the event trying to reclaim some of the momentum seized by reigning Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick , who won last week at Dover to keep his title defense intact.\nJGR drivers Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth won the first two races in the opening round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championships.\nBut the stakes are higher in round two, which includes races at Charlotte, Kansas and finally Talladega.\nThe field has been trimmed to 12 drivers, and JGR qualified all four of its cars in the top eight at Charlotte.\nKenseth and Kyle Busch will start on the front row, while Harvick will start 11th.\nHarvick is the defending race winner, and used his Charlotte victory last year to coast into the third round of the playoffs.\nA victory in a Chase race earns a driver an automatic berth into the next round.\nThe race was postponed at 6:55 p.m. — 26 minutes before the race was scheduled to start — with rain still falling and weather radar indicating that it wouldn't stop anytime soon.\nEven if the rain had halted at some point Saturday night, it's estimated that it would have taken a minimum of two hours for the track's 12 Air Titan drying machines and eight jet driers to completely dry out the track's surface.\nThe race will be shown on NBC Sports Network .\nA prerace show is still scheduled Sunday morning, including Erendira Wallenda, who will be suspended over the infield on an aerial ring hanging by a cable under a helicopter.\nFormula One: Mercedes' Nico Rosberg took pole position for the Russian Grand Prix on Saturday ahead of his teammate and title rival Lewis Hamilton . Rosberg set an unbeatable time of 1 minute, 37.113 seconds midway through the final qualifying session in Sochi, more than three tenths of a second faster than Hamilton. The top drivers had been in an uncertain situation ahead of qualifying after rain and various incidents, including a heavy crash for Toro Rosso 's Carlos Sainz , reduced dry practice time to a minimum. \"Very happy. It's been a difficult weekend because of the little running we got,\" Rosberg said. \"Qualifying worked out really well. We found a good balance on my car, thanks to my engineers as well. We had to guess a bit.\" Hamilton challenged for the top spot with an aggressive final lap, but he ran off track and aborted the attempt.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/56/8772485/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/56/8772485/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:49:58.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
