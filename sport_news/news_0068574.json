Sponsored by Bengals 34, Bills 21 Oct. 18, Ralph Wilson Stadium With several injuries to the offense, the Bills (3-3) defense needed to step up. It got stepped on. Bengals (6-0) QB Andy Dalton passed for three touchdowns against a Buffalo defense that failed to sack him. EJ Manuel started for the injured Tyrod Taylor and was serviceable, throwing for 263 yards and a touchdown and rushing for another score. Buffalo is 1-3 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The Bills should have an easier matchup next week against the 1-5 Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Bills 14, Titans 13 Oct. 11, Nissan Stadium, Nashville, Tenn. This was a laughable performance for the Bills for most of the game, but luckily, Tyrod Taylor came to the rescue. Taylor engineered two late scoring drives with the help of his running prowess and a 46-yard bomb to Chris Hogan to give Buffalo its first victory over the Titans since 2000. An ugly win if there ever was one, but a win nonetheless. Up next, the undefeated Bengals. Giants 24, Bills 10 Oct. 4, Ralph Wilson Stadium Flags, flags and more flags. The Bills couldn't stay out of trouble against Eli Manning and the Giants and sunk to .500 in defeat. Without stars LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins -- both sidelined with injuries -- the Bills' offense was mostly lifeless. Buffalo ran for just 55 yards (2.3 average) on 24 attempts. Bills 41, Dolphins 14 Sept. 27, Sun Life Stadium Tyrod Taylor played like a seasoned veteran, Buffalo's defense looked like the one Rex Ryan has been bragging about, and the Miami Dolphins were, well, an absolute train wreck. Add it up and the Bills embarrassed their AFC East rivals 41-14 at muggy Sun Life Stadium. Patriots 40, Bills 32 Sept. 20, Ralph Wilson Stadium The Ralph was rockin'. Then it wasn't. Then it was again. But in the end, the Patriots did what they always seem to do ... beat the Bills. Tom Brady threw for 466 yards and 3 TDs as New England dominated much of the game before allowing three fourth-quarter scores to make things interesting. Alas, on the Bills' final drive, Tyrod Taylor threw his third interception to end hopes of a miraculous comeback. Despite a lot of talk all week, the Pats proved they are still tops in the division. Bills 27, Colts 14 Sept. 13, Ralph Wilson Stadium They say it's not how you start, but how you finish. Well, \"they\" would still be quite impressed with what the Bills did in Week 1 against Andrew Luck and the Colts. Buffalo put on a show and QB Tyrod Taylor made his coaches look smart with an efficient stat line and an impressive 51-yard TD bomb to Percy Harvin to ignite the crowd. After the Bills scored on their opening drive of the second half to open up a 24-0 lead, the party was on. What's next for the Bills? Scroll ahead to look at the rest of the Bills schedule this season. Week 7 Oct. 25, 9:30 a.m. Wembley Stadium, London (Insert corny English phrase in a terrible accent.) Luckily for the Bills, they aren't the \"home\" team for this one. The Jags are regulars in England, committing to a game each year at Wembley from 2013 to 2016. Week 8 Nov. 8, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Coming off the bye, this is the first of three key AFC East games in a row for Buffalo. The Bills have defeated the Dolphins three straight years at home and will look to extend it to four for the first time in the series' history. Week 10 Nov. 12, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday night) Met Life Stadium The Bills visit Rex Ryan's former home in their first of two primtetime games this season. They also begin a stretch of five games on the road in six weeks -- something they haven't done since 1991. Week 11 Nov. 23, 8:30 p.m. (Monday night) Gillette Stadium The Bills finally won in Foxborough last season -- the first time in 13 tries -- in the final game of the year. This game will be a Monday nighter and not since 2009 have the Bills played two prime-time games in one season. Week 12 Nov. 29, 1 p.m. Arrowhead Stadium After the Patriots game, the Bills have to turn around on short rest and travel to Kansas City. That's just as tough a task as playing a team coming off extra rest. The NFL did the Bills no favors with that one. Week 13 Dec. 6, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium J.J. Watt, arguably the best defensive player in the NFL, has a new buddy in Houston and someone with which the Bills are quite familiar. Former Patriot Vince Wilfork joined the team this offseason, signing a two-year contract. Houston defeated Buffalo, 23-17, last season. Week 14 Dec. 13, 1 p.m. Lincoln Financial Field Of course Rex returning to Met Life is a big deal. But another new Bill has this one circled on his calendar. Running back LeSean McCoy was traded to the Bills for young linebacker Kiko Alonso in the offseason and most likely wants to put on a good show for his former fans. Week 15 Dec. 20, 1 p.m. FedExField The Bills have struggled mightily in recent years, but they have had Washington's number. The Bills are 6-0 against the Redskins since 1993. Week 16 Dec. 27, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Tony Romo is clearly among one of the better QBs the Bills face in 2015. Interestingly, Buffalo is at home in most cases where it faces an elite (or near-elite) quarterback (Brady, Romo, Luck, Manning). Week 17 Jan. 3, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium A fitting end to the season with Rex Ryan hosting his former team at the Ralph. In the 55 years the Bills have been playing in the AFL and NFL, they have never played a slate where they start with two games at home and finish with their last two at home.

Defensive tackle Kyle Williams and receiver Sammy Watkins suffered serious-looking injuries. The Bills head to London Sunday night to begin preparing for the game against the Jaguars. 150 CONNECT 16 TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nORCHARD PARK - The petulant, bordering on poor sport attitude that marked Rex Ryan's postgame press conferences following Buffalo's first two losses of the season was nowhere to be found Sunday afternoon. \nInstead, the Bills head coach looked positively shell-shocked, humbled, even flabbergasted, by what took place during Buffalo's 34-21 loss to the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals at Ralph Wilson Stadium where the weather was more indecisive than EJ Manuel going through his read progression. \nRyan is one of the most upbeat guys in the business, but after watching his allegedly elite defense get worked over by Andy Dalton and company, and seeing his offense continue to crumble under the weight of endless injuries, Ryan couldn't bring himself to be salty in defeat. He looked and sounded like a man searching for answers that just aren't coming. \n\"I think it’s affecting everybody’s morale, mine included,\" Ryan said. \"You have a vision of what this team can be when we’re healthy and it’s just frustrating because you don’t have your parts. I know we can compete with anybody, but it just seems like we take a step forward and then we end up taking two steps back. It’s been a frustrating year and these injuries, it’s just amazing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:29:56.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
