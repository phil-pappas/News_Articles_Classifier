KING — State Journal archives \nUW’s Corey Clement rushed just eight times for 16 yards in a 35-17 season-opening loss to Alabama on Sept 5. The junior has not played since while dealing with a sports hernia. He has rushed 222 times for 1,512 yards and 16 touchdowns in his career. \nSpeaking with the media for the first time since sports hernia surgery, University of Wisconsin running back Corey Clement said he remained uncertain about his status for Saturday’s football game at Illinois. \nHe said following Tuesday’s practice he feels much better than last week but still can’t fully open up and reach his top speed. \n“(I need to be) able to open up more, be confident and hit a certain miles per hour at practice,” Clement said. “I’m used to hitting 20-plus sometime during practice. I haven’t hit it yet.” \nClement, who was cleared to play against Purdue on Saturday, warmed up and wore full pads throughout the win but did not play. \nHe said the decision to ultimately sit out was his to make — one that wasn’t finalized until speaking with UW running backs coach John Settle at halftime. \n“As I went back in the locker room, I gave myself a little pep talk, talked to the coaching staff and I was trying to give it a go,” Clement said. “Me and Coach Settle exchanged words and said we really don’t need you at this point, so why not just watch the rest of the game and heal up for next week.” \nClement has participated in contact practices, and he purposely made his practice more physical Tuesday to see how his body would handle it. He intentionally collided with defensive backs and went up against Alec James in a contact drill. \nClement confirmed what Dr. Ulrike Muschaweck, the sports hernia specialist who performed Clement’s surgery, told the State Journal two weeks ago — there is no risk of re-injury once he returns. \n“I don’t believe I’ll set myself back if I keep pushing it. I knew what the problem was and I got it fixed,” Clement said. “So there’s not too much I could do at this point damaging-wise, but I think if I play it safe I should be good to go.” \nClement has missed UW’s past six games battling the injury. He suffered what he thought was a groin injury Sept. 1 and attempted to play against Alabama four days later. \nHe only received 12 touches against the Crimson Tide — most of which came in the first quarter — and sat out the next two games while attempting to rehab the injury. \nAfter he made no progress, Clement underwent an MRI on Sept. 23 that revealed he had a sports hernia. He underwent surgery the next week and has missed three games since. \nUW said Clement would remain out four to six weeks following surgery, but Muschaweck told the State Journal the typical recovery timetable for this procedure is two to three weeks. \nClement plans on traveling with the team to Illinois and said his status “can only be determined when I wake up Saturday morning.” \n“You guys will probably see how it’s going to go if I decide to take the first reps,” he said. \nClement said the hurdles he needs to overcome are 50 percent physical and 50 percent mental — making sure he’s in football shape after six weeks off and having the confidence to go full-speed ahead. \n“I’m not going to feel 100 percent just like that,” he said. “I’ve got to take that into consideration and just try to build upon each day and be happy with some of the progress I’m making. \n“I’ve been out of football for six weeks. It’s tough to get back. If you say you can just hop back into it like that, you’re lying to yourself. I think I’ve just got to get back into the rhythm of things.” \nThe Badgers’ running game has struggled this season, a year after Clement combined with former UW running back Melvin Gordon to gain more rushing yards than any pair of teammates in FBS history. He rushed for 949 yards last season on just 147 carries (6.5 yards per carry). \nUW has averaged less than 3 yards per carry in three of its four games against Power Five-conference teams this season. \n“I plan to help this team out and get the running game going again,” Clement said. “We all know it fell off from last year. It’s not where it’s supposed to be at this point. My job, being a leader of that running back group, you’ve got to have a purpose when you come back — and that’s to put numbers back on the board and get this thing going.” +1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:51:15.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
