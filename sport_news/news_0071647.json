(AP) - An Amtrak train headed from Vermont to Washington, D.C., derailed in central Vermont on Monday after apparently striking rocks that were on the tracks. No life-threatening injuries were reported.\nThe Vermonter train derailed near Roxbury, about 20 miles southwest of the capital, Montpelier.\nMontpelier Fire Department spokeswoman Dana Huoppi told WPTZ-TV: \"There are some people that are shaken up, but it sounds like they are only going to transport four by ambulance at this time.\"\nThe 13-hour, 45-minute daily trip begins in St. Albans in northern Vermont. The route passes through cities including Burlington, Vermont, Springfield, Massachusetts, and New York, with D.C. as the final destination.\nAmtrak said in a statement that the train \"reportedly\" struck a rock slide on the tracks and that no critical injuries had been reported.\nAt least several dozen passengers were loaded onto school buses to be taken to an armory at nearby Norwich University.\nMatthew Lehner, a spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration, said it was aware of the derailment and had sent investigators to the scene.\nVermont State Police and local fire and rescue agencies responded to the derailment, and numerous emergency vehicles were at the site.\nThe governor's office said officials would hold a news conference Monday afternoon to update on the derailment.\nAssociated Press writer Joan Lowy contributed to this report from Washington, D.C.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
