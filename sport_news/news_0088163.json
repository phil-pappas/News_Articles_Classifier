The team has played hard all season, but is out of playoff contention. Pahrump will be playing for pride tonight at 7 p.m. \nTrojans coach Adam Gent says despite the terrible loss to Faith Lutheran, his team's spirits are high. \n\"The boys are excited for the last game of the year,\" Gent said. \nOf course along with excitement there are also some that will be emotional. For senior quarterback TJ Milk this will be his last high school football game. \n\"It's sort of surreal that it's over,\" Milk said. \"It's a different feeling than last year. I knew last year I had another season. I was sad last home game because it was my last one. All the seniors are sad that it's over, but we will step up this week because we want to end the season with a win.\" \nGent said Sierra Vista (2-6 overall, 2-4 Sunset League) will come at them with a double-tight, twin wing and they don't spread it out much. This is a formation that the Trojans (3-5, 2-4) defend well and this should give them a slight edge. \nThe coach wants this win too and is going for the same record the Trojans had last year, which was a 3-4 league record. \nHe said injuries shouldn't be a factor in tonight's game. \n\"We did have some injuries but only Parker Hart won't be able to play Friday,\" he said. \"We match up well with Sierra Vista and if our boys play how I know they can, I believe we can win. Sierra Vista is a good football team and plays very physical smash-mouth football.\" \nContact sports editor   on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:41:51.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
