Still, there's no overstating the sacrifice Lovullo made for the organization and for his friend, John Farrell . The regular season is barely over, and already the Nationals have fired Matt Williams and the Padres decided interim manager Pat Murphy won't return. Lovullo would've been a candidate for at least one, if not both of those jobs. He was a finalist for the Twins and Rangers jobs last year and previously interviewed for openings with the Indians and the Red Sox (before Bobby Valentine was hired in 2012), and his stock will never be higher than after guiding the Sox to a 28-20 mark in Farrell's absence. Managerial jobs open every year, but there's no telling when Lovullo will be in such a favorable position to land one of them. \"I have a love for the organization, I have a love for John, I have a love for the players,\" Lovullo said. \"If something were to happen (elsewhere), my time is coming -- if it's meant to be. It just felt like this was the right thing to do to stay here to see it through.\" Raise or no raise, not many people would've made that decision.\n-- Rick Porcello allowed three runs on 10 hits and one walk over seven innings Sunday, a performance he summed up with two words: \"That's me.\" Porcello continued: \"I'm not going to go out there and strike out 17 and throw no-hitters. But I'll give us a chance to win.\" In other words, Porcello isn't Max Scherzer , not that we didn't already know that. Porcello posted a 3.14 ERA with 57 strikeouts and 58 hits allowed in 57-1/3 innings over his final eight starts, numbers the Sox would happily take next season. Here's the problem: Porcello will be paid $20.125 million annually beginning next season. For that money, you expect ace-caliber results. There's little question the pressure of pitching for a new team and living up to that contract extension weighed on Porcello for the first two-thirds of the season. It's what caused him to put his signature two-seamer on the shelf and try to overpower hitters. Porcello will never be that kind of pitcher, regardless of how much money he makes. Better late than never, he seems to realize that. The presence of an ace atop the rotation next season would help the Sox in so many ways, but the best might be that it eases some of the burden that Porcello seemed to feel this year.\n--Defensively, Jackie Bradley Jr. remains without peer. At the plate, though, he's still a mystery. In 221 big-league at-bats, Bradley slashed .249/.335/.498 with 17 doubles, 10 home runs and 43 RBI, production that would be more than adequate over a full season considering his defense. But most of those numbers came during a 25-game run from Aug. 9 through Sept. 7 in which he went 37-for-83 (.446) with 13 doubles, seven homers, 32 RBI and a ridiculous 1.441 OPS. Prior to that stretch, he went 7-for-58 (.121) with one homer and a .426 OPS. After it, he was 11-for-80 (.138) with four doubles, two homers and a .510 OPS. One interesting note: During Bradley's surge, the Sox played mostly out-of-division teams, including interleague games against the Marlins and Mets. Over the season's final four weeks, when Bradley's bat cooled, they returned to AL East play, facing teams that were more familiar with how to pitch him. Bradley has played 239 games in the big leagues over the past three seasons. Ten of his 35 career multi-hit games came during that 25-game span this year. So, the question is this: Was Bradley's hot streak merely an aberration, or an indication that he's really becoming a more capable hitter? \"We know he's still trying to become an established major-league hitter. It takes a little bit of time,\" Lovullo said. \"That great month really gave him some confidence and an understanding that he can be successful at this level. We know it's going to take some time for him to get to where he wants to get to offensively. You throw in the combination of him being an elite defender, and he's exactly where he should be.\"\n--Finally, Xander Bogaerts finished four hits shy of 200 and second in the league to Houston's Jose Altuve . But that hardly diminishes a breakthrough season for the 23-year-old shortstop, who batted .320 and finished second to Detroit's Miguel Cabrera for the AL batting title. But while Bogaerts was pleased with his progress at the plate, he was prouder of his defensive improvement. \"I always knew I had good hands, but just making all those plays, sometimes I’m like, ‘Wow, you really came a long way. Definitely be proud of yourself,'\" Bogaerts said. \"Now I learned to throw the ball more accurately over there. I learned what my body needs to do, the right position I need to be in. That was the best thing for me, just kind of realizing and understanding what I needed to do to get into a good position.\"\nTwitter: @ScottLauber", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:48:20.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
