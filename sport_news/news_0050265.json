People want to make nothing into something, especially when we lose. That's just football.\" \nHardy issued a half-dozen \"no comments\" to questions in the locker room, then turned his back to the reporters. \nCowboys coach Jason Garrett and owner Jerry Jones said the Hardy incident was not an issue. \nGarrett said he thought Hardy was attempting to encourage the special-teams unit. \n\"I was standing right there,'' Garrett said after the Cowboys lost their fourth straight game. \"To be a good football player and a good football team, you have to have passion and put it all out there. Sometimes in a game, things don't go well and you have a response. A pro football coach and a pro football team understand that those things happen. You want the guys with passion. \n\"It was coming off the football field. That happens, you encourage guys, you try to get guys excited. You try to get guys ready for the next challenge. I believe from my vantage point, that's what he was doing.'' \nJones said he did not see the altercation, but the incident was described to him. \n\"As a matter of fact, I would encourage it,\" Jones said of Hardy's passion. \"He's of course one of the real leaders on this team and he earns it. He earns it with the respect from all of his teammates. That's the kind of thing that inspires. You watched him warm up out there and he was inspirational ... nothing but warming up. He was ready to play. He's just getting guys ready to play, in my view. I don't have any issue with him being involved in motivating or pushing in any part of the football team because he plays and walks the walk.\" Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
