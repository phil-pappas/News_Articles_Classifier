He just never got the chance to play every day,” said Rios. “I’m glad he got the chance. He certainly took advantage of it.”\nDid Rios see the symmetry of it all — one right fielder yielding his position to another and now the two facing off six years later?\n“That’s baseball,” said Rios.\nBautista was asked whose job he took when he became an everyday player?\n“Was it Kevin Mench? No he was gone in 2008? Was in Scott Rolen? No, I was in right field,” said Bautista near the Jays dugout.\nBautista made 32 starts in right after Rios had started 102 games (Snider had 19 starts and Joe Inglett nine). He also had 22 starts at third base, while Rolen had 87 and Edwin Encarnacion 42.\nTold he took over for the current K.C. right fielder, he said “Rios? That’s baseball.”\nSimilar answers, similar players.\nBoth had the key hits in Game 5 to get their teams here. Rios bounced a double inside the third-base bag off Houston Astros’ reliever Mike Fiers, scoring Sal Perez and Alex Gordon to give the Royals a 3-2 lead. Bautista’s Jays were tied 3-3 in the seventh inning when Sam Dyson threw a pitch he turned around and drove to left-centre for a three-run homer. Bautista then turned and flipped the bat toward the K.C. dugout. Dyson, the menacing man, caused two bench-emptying events — the first with Encarnacion and the second with Troy Tulowitzki.\nBefore looking up the age differences in the two, we guessed that Rios was four years older.\nWe asked our Ken Fidlin and he guessed three years. We asked Jay Stenhouse, the Jays’ crack P.R. man and he guessed three.\nBautista was born Oct. 19, 1980 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nRios was born 122 days later in Coffee, Ala., and went to high school in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. He spent five years with the White Sox, two with the Texas Rangers and signed with the Royals as a free agent.\nIn his 12 years, Rios has played 1,691 games, hitting 169 homers, driving in 794, stealing 253 bases and owns a career .277 average with a .755 OPS.\nBautista has played 1,403 in 12 years with 286 homers, 793 RBIs, 58 steals, a .257 average and an .865 OPS.\nOne was supposed to be a Blue Jays legend.\nOne became one.\nALMOST A RED SOX\nBefore the Jays put Rios on waivers and the White Sox picked up the $61.667 million US remaining on his contract, the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals expressed interest.\nA year later, the best offer for Roy Halladay came from Boston leading up to the July 31 2009, non-waiver trade deadline. The Jays said no to an offer of right-handed starters Clay Buchholz and Justin Masterson, reliever Michael Bowden, lefty Nick Hagadone and a position player, likely outfielder Josh Reddick.\nThe Red Sox, who according to one Boston official made an offer of “half of what we made for Halladay.”\nSo, why allow Rios to walk and get zero players in return? Well, two different people were making the decisions.\nThen, general manager J.P. Ricciardi gave the trades a thumbs-down before the July 31 deadline, but president Paul Beeston made the call on Aug. 11 to clear the Rios salary from the books.\nNOLAN, NOLAN\nHarold Reynolds of FOX Sports told this one the other day, when he was a young Seattle Mariners second baseman facing a Hall of Famer right-hander Nolan Ryan.\n“After he’d finish his final warmup pitch of the game, he’d come down off the mound, walk halfway to home plate and stamp on the turf as if patting it down,” Reynolds said. “No one in the crowd could tell, but when he had his head down he was saying: ‘DON’T YOU BUNT ON ME, DON’T YOU DARE BUNT ON ME.’\n“I stepped in and I stand right up on the plate. He throws a pitch up and under my chin. Down I go. Now, I’m thinking if I back off the plate, he’ll think I’m afraid, so I stand in the exact same spot.\n“I drew a walk and stole second. Next day, I’m playing catch in the outfield and Nolan is doing his running, he goes by me and whispers: ‘Hey kid ... way to compete last night.’”\nUP IN THE BOOTH\nThornhill’s Dan Shulman was doing the broadcast for ESPN radio along with former New York Yankee Aaron Boone ... Former Blue Jays right-hander Jack Morris is doing work for MLB.com ... Fox TV aired an hour-long program recapping the full seventh inning from Game 5 of the Jays-Rangers AL Division Series — The Unforgettable Inning, hosted by former pitcher C.J. Nitkowski. Not every play will be shown as the inning took 53 minutes to unfold and, no doubt, there were commercials. The Rangers went ahead by one before the Jays rallied for four, three on Bautista’s bat flip for the decade.\nUPWARDLY MANAGER\nCambridge’s Scott Thorman managed the rookie-class Burlington Royals in the Kansas City system to a 31-37 record in the Appalachian League this season. Royals general manager Dayton Moore said Thorman did a “good job” and will manage next year.\nJ.J. Picollo, assistant GM said Thorman is managing the Royals’ advanced instructional league team in Phoenix. The Royals home base at Surprise, Ariz., is undergoing rennovations, so they have a new fall home.\n“We’re one of six teams with two instructional league teams,” said Picollo. “Scott is managing the older team with players from class-A, double-A and triple-A.\n“He had a very young team at Burlington, but he’s a high-energy manager. They had some six-game winning streaks and some six- or seven-game losing streaks. He’ll manage next year. We don’t know what team yet.”\nA No. 1 pick of the Atlanta Braves in 2000, Thorman had Carlos Martinez, Kevin Kuntz and Jesus Azuaje as his coaches. Thorman played for the Ontario Blue Jays and Team Ontario.\nNOT RETIRING\nWe wish people would stop referring to Jays president Paul Beeston’s departure as a retirement. Rogers Communications tried to boot him out the door at the end of last season and didn’t rehire him for 2015 until Jan. 31. He is not retiring. He is being asked to leave.\nSTAT ATTACK\nThe ALCS features two teams with the league’s best regular-season records the Royals (95–67) and Blue Jays (93–69) for the first time since 2009 when the New York Yankees (103-59) beat the Los Angeles Angels (97-65) in six games ... The Jays led the majors in stolen-base percentage, swiping 88 bases (79% success rate), with centre fielder Kevin Pillar going 25-for-29 ... The Jays had 36 successful bunts this season, led by Ryan Goins with seven, followed by Ezequiel Carrera with five. Goins bunted Pillar to second base in the third inning of Friday night’s series opener.\nHALL OF FAMER\nRoyals bench coach Don Wakamatsu was honored by the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame last year with the ‘Pete Caldera/Duke Castiglione, I Didn’t Know He Was Irish Award.’ The former Blue Jays bench coach and former Seattle Mariners manager has his 2015 all-star lineup card from the AL dugout on display.\nHe does all his lineup cards in calligraphy.\nThe Irish American Hall is located inside Foley’s Pub and Restaurant (18 West 33rd St., in Manhattan, across from the Empire State Building).\nInductees include Connie Mack, Tug McGraw, Mark McGwire, Sean Casey, Kevin Costner, Walter O’Malley, Steve Garvey, Vin Scully, Brian Cashman, Tim McCarver, Bob Murphy, Big Ed Walsh, John McGraw, ‘Wee Willie’ Keeler, Gene Michael, Jimmy Breslin, Rusty Staub, Hal McCoy and Jack McKeon.\nMLB PLAYOFFS\nSymmetry of the starting right fielders\nBy Bob Elliott , Toronto Sun First posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 10:51 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:11 PM EDT\nAnd on Aug. 10, 2009, an era in right field came to an end at the Rogers Centre.\nAlex Rios, the No. 1 draft pick of the Blue Jays in 1999, was claimed by the Chicago White Sox on waivers.\nAnd taking his place, moving from backup to starting role was Jose Bautista.\nThe former Jays right fielder was in right field for Game 1 of the American League Championship Series on Friday at Kauffman Stadium, wearing his Kansas City Royals uniform No. 15, with Bautista wearing his No. 19 in right field for Toronto.\nRios was asked if he remembered who took his position when he headed for the White Sox, way back then?\n“I’m not sure, Travis Snider?” asked Rios between rounds of batting practice.\nTold it was Bautista, Rios smiled and recalled how the Jays had acquired Bautista from the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n“He was a good player, but he was a backup then.
