Tuaua and Petties-Wilson played against the Golden Gophers but missed the past three games. \nCoach Gary Patterson said the players had \"gone through the judicial process,\" although a Fort Worth police spokesman said the case hasn't been forwarded to Tarrant County prosecutors. \nTuaua played all 12 games with five starts last season. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
