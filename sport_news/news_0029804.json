Austin ran for 103 yards against Pierce City. Posted: Wednesday, October 7, 2015 12:00 pm | Updated: 12:00 pm, Wed Oct 7, 2015. El Dorado Springs hammers Pierce City By   \nEl Dorado Springs does not have an impressive record, 3-4, but it still is in the hunt for a home game in the district playoffs which begin Friday, Oct. 23. The top four teams in Class 2 District 4 will host a first-round contest, and after losses by Stockton and University Academy Charter last week the Bulldogs have jumped into fifth place because of their 48-20 rout of Pierce City Friday, Oct. 2. A win over Strafford, a game to be played at 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 9, could pull El Dorado closer to fourth place. El Dorado Springs was too good for Pierce City and won easily 48-20. The Bulldogs’ offensive unit simply was too much as it compiled 490 yards. Jakob Studer’s touchdown and a two-point run by Lance Molz gave the Dogs an 8-0 lead. Following a score by Pierce City, Molz showed how talented and fast he is as a runner by scoring on a 19-yard dash. Later in the game, Molz found open space and scored on a 38-yard running play to give the Bulldogs a 26-7 lead. An interception was turned into a touchdown by Studer when he completed a pass to Dayton Austin with less than a minute left in the first half. The 34-7 lead continued to grow during the second half as Molz turned a broken play into a 39-yard scoring run. Landen Smith added to the team’s lead with a 54-yard touchdown run, and Trenton Hardie’s touchdown closed out the night for the Bulldogs. “I thought our boys did a great job of building on the momentum that we saw in the University Academy game. We still made some mistakes tonight, and we saw some things that we need to fine tune, but overall I was very proud of the effort that we saw on the field tonight,” Coach Derek Scroggins said. “I thought defensively we played very well, coach Carpenter did a great job of getting our guys ready and they came out and controlled the line of scrimmage most of the night.” When they have the football, the Bulldogs do most of their damage on offense with a set of plays which include fakes, nifty ball handling and a power running game. During the team’s first six games, El Dorado attempted fewer than 20 passes. The team’s running game was its calling card. Leading the attack with more than 890 yards during the team’s first six games are Lance Molz and Dayton Austin. Quarterback Jakob Studer also is a tough ball carrier. Of the team’s 20 offensive touchdowns before the Pierce City game, 17 were produced by running the football. The strong running attack was on display once again last week versus Pierce City as the Bulldogs ran for 418 yards and scored several touchdowns. The duo of Molz and Austin combined for 272 yards. The Bulldogs are led on defense by Studer, Riley Boyd and Ethan Dubois. Dubois is the leader with 104 tackles, but the Bulldogs love to swarm around the football and opposing players. Such was the case versus Pierce City as Dubois made tackles in the backfield, along the sideline and in the middle of the field to finish the game with 22 stops. He was not alone because he was joined by his aggressive teammates. Boyd had 10 tackles, Kelly Keith sacked the quarterback and Jake Schieffer had an interception.
