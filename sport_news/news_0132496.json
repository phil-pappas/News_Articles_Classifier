Senior defender Fiebernitz buried the ball in the far right corner past IU goalkeeper Sarah Stone in the 13th minute. \nMoments later, Fiebernitz would again hit her sweet spot on the second penalty of the day to make it 2-0 in the 18th minute. \nSenior Kirsten Evans praised Fiebernitz for “refusing to be nothing but the best,” crediting her extra time put in after practice for the successful penalty kick conversions. \n“She’s brilliant,” Evans said of Fiebernitz. “She struggled before in them during practice – I believe she missed a couple. She stayed after and worked on them until she finished them in the back of the net. That just goes to show the type of character she has.” \nIndiana took full advantage of a handball in the box, as Jessie Bujouves shot off a penalty kick just grazed past the fingertips of Gauruder to make the game 2-1. \nGauruder finished the match with four saves to her credit. \nMSU had multiple other scoring attempts as senior Allyson Krause had three near shots on goal while sophomore Madison Duncan took her own shot. \nThe Spartans quenched their thirst for an insurance goal, as midfielder Evans would bend the ball into the back of the net on a corner kick in the 82nd minute. Falling to the ground in disbelief and celebration with arms outstretched, Evans’ teammates ran to congratulate her. \nMichigan State head coach Tom Saxton credited Evans for her performance, praising her for helping the midfield to calm down in the second half to regain possession. \n“I thought Evans went out and did some really good things for us coming in from the reserve role,” Saxton said. “She kind of settled us down at midfield. The corner was a result from pressure. Corner kicks are a reward for pressure. Kirsten, who’s been a brilliant server of the ball her whole career, maybe didn’t plan on that, but I think the runs in front of the box drew took away the goalie’s attention and got the break we needed.” \nWhile MSU outshot Indiana 20-14 the game was one of intense physicality with Indiana garnering 13 fouls in the first half alone to MSU’s 10. \nSweetening the win was the fact that two seniors provided their team with the win on senior day in order to gain three critical points in the hunt for making the Big Ten Tourney. \nWith Wisconsin clinching the overall regular season title earlier this week, the Spartans now are tied for seventh with Ohio State. The Buckeyes and Spartans have even conference records (4-4-2) while Ohio State holds a 9-5-3 overall record to MSU’s 8-5-4 standing. \nBattling it out for the much-coveted postseason spot, the Spartans will travel to Columbus on Wednesday to wrestle with the Buckeyes. \n“I keep going back to if we can focus on what we can do best, we will get the result,” Fiebernitz said. “We control our destiny. We just need to focus on what we are doing and not what the hoopla is outside of our team.” \nFiebernitz said that while Ohio State is a good team, it will be up to MSU to bring its defense prowess to the field while converting on offense. \n“Ohio State’s a very good team,” Fiebernitz said. “They’re doing very well in the Big Ten. The expectation is to come out and play hard Spartan defense.” Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1S51BOG TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:59:48.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
