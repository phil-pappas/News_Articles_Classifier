But a minute later, the U.S. went back up for good after Lindsey Horan took Meghan Klingenberg's corner kick and tapped it to Dunn, who then slipped it past Luciana. McCaffrey added another goal just before the final horn. \nFor the second straight match, the U.S. team bid farewell to retiring players. Sunday was the final international match for 29-year-old U.S. midfielder Lauren Holiday and 31-year-old defender Lori Chalupny. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:32:46.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
