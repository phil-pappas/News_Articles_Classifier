Rosales/Albuquerque Journal)\nA man who allegedly shot an Albuquerque police officer during a traffic stop near Eubank and Central was taken into custody after an hours-long manhunt Wednesday night, according to officer Tanner Tixier, a department spokesman.\nPolice said Davon Lymon, 34, was arrested in connection to the shooting that left an 8-year veteran of the department critically wounded.\nChief Gorden Eden said the male officer was undergoing his second surgery at the University of New Mexico Hospital shortly after 10 p.m.\n“They are working diligently to save this officer’s life,” Eden said outside the hospital emergency room late Wednesday night. “We are in the best place where an officer can be in this condition.”\nEden said the officer, whom he didn’t name, pulled over a motorcycle and an altercation took place around 7:45 p.m. He said the officer deployed his Taser before he was shot.\nEden said the officer was shot multiple times, but he didn’t say exactly how many times or where on his body the officer was shot.\nPolice launched a manhunt for one suspect Eden described as “armed and dangerous,” and he was later taken into custody by APD’s canine unit.\nThe suspect, who was found with one handcuff still on, was later identified as Lymon.\nCourt records show Lymon has a lengthy criminal history.\nHe was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the beating and shooting of a man in 2001 and sentenced to 11 1/2 years in prison, and has faced more recent felony charges as well, according to online court records.\nOfficers are still looking for a woman who was on the motorcycle with the man during the shooting, but police don’t consider her dangerous, Tixier said.\nAt least 100 law enforcement officers were in the area after the shooting, including Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputies and New Mexico State Police. Convoys of police cars sped through surrounding neighborhoods with their sirens blaring, while two helicopters circled above.\nEubank was closed from Southern to Interstate 40, and Central was also closed for the sprawling, chaotic crime scene.\nPolice tactical units used the nearby Home Depot parking lot south of Central Avenue as a staging area as they searched for the suspect. Multiple armored vehicles were at the scene.\nAndrew Martinez said he was eating at a nearby Subway restaurant when he heard five to six shots ring out.\nMartinez said officers arrived within minutes. They told him to leave shortly after.\nEden asked anyone with information about the shooting to call police.\n“This person knows exactly what he has done,” Eden said.\nEden said the department is praying for the officer.\n“This is for me a terrible day,” he said. “Our officers go out there and put their lives on the line, they put their lives on the line for our community every single day. They are the guardians for the city of Albuquerque.”\nMayor Richard Berry was with Eden as he spoke to reporters Wednesday.\n“We grieve together, we fight crime together, we come together during times of crisis and when things are good,” Berry said. “So let’s as a community hang together during these difficult times. Keep our officer in your thoughts and prayers.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1-20-640x427.jpg", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d52254.447269821474!2d-106.58491148171287!3d35.059165305238615!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x8718a08051a87761%3A0xba8181585ca06d10!2sCentral+Ave+SE+%26+Eubank+Blvd+NE%2C+Albuquerque%2C+NM+87123!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1445479758241", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_2396-640x399.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Armored-640x398.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image4-1-640x427.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image3-9-640x375.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image3-8-640x416.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWAT-640x420.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:02:24.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
