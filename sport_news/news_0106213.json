The former Borussia Dortmund and Werder Bremen man, who is now 33 years, left the team in the summer of 2013 and has been without a club since.\nStriker Marwan Mohsen, who ended a disappointing spell at Portugal's Gil Vicente to join Ismaily in the summer, converted a penalty to put Ismaily in front on the stroke of halftime.\nTaha Adel was lucky to add the second with 11 minutes remaining at a time when El-Entag looked close to restoring parity.\nEl-Entag, managed by former Egypt coach Shawky Gharib, signed some veterans who are way past their prime, including Zidan, forward Mohamed Gedo and defender Mahmoud Fathallah who were all part of Egypt's African Cup of Nations winning campaign in 2010.\nShikabala and midfielder Hosni Abd-Rabou, who was included in Ismaily's starting line-up against El-Entag, were also part of the Egypt side which triumphed in Angola.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:37:48.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
