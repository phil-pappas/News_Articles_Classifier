Paul Domowitch Posted: Thursday, October 22, 2015, 1:31 PM \nInjured linebackers Mychal Kendricks and Kiko Alonso practiced for the second straight day Thursday. Alonso who has been out since Week 2 with a knee injury, isn’t expected to play Sunday night against Carolina, but probably will return after the bye week for the Eagles’ Nov. 8 prime-time game at Dallas. \nKendricks, who has missed three of the last four games with a hamstring injury, was a full practice participant Wednesday, raising hopes that he might be able to play against the 5-0 Panthers. His availability would be helpful given that DeMeco Ryans injured his hamstring in Monday night’s 27-7 win over the Giants. \n“(Kendricks) did good,’’ coach Chip Kelly said. “He’ll be back out there again today and we’ll see where (the hamstring) is. The thing with Mychal is consecutive days. So what happens today? And then we have Friday and Saturday.’’ \nSome other highlights from Kelly’s Thursday morning presser: More coverage The Eagles sacked Cam Newton nine times last season. How many times will they sack him on Sunday? Zero View results \n--Wide receiver Jordan Matthews had his best game of his rookie season against Carolina last year, catching seven balls for 138 yards and two touchdowns in the 45-21 Eagles win. Kelly said the Panthers played more man coverage against them in that game and Matthews took advantage of the matchups. \n--Kelly said the Panthers’ Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis are the best pair of linebackers the Eagles will face this season. “Neither of them come off the field (on third down) and they shouldn’t,’’ he said. “They can cover tight ends, running backs. And they can run sideline to sideline. It’s a tall task for us.’’ \n--Kelly said opposing defenses have played more man coverage against the Eagles so far this season than they did last year. He said it has been a 51-49 split between man and zone through six games. Last year, he said, it was 60-40 zone to man. He said it was 60-40 man to zone two years ago. \n--Carolina is averaging a league-high 32.8 rushing attempts per game. The Panthers are third in rushing (132.8 yards per game), but only 18th in rushing average (4.0 yards per carry). “The challenge is they’re going to try and pound you,’’ Kelly said. “And they’ve got a back in Jonathan (Stewart) who is a big, physical, downhill running back. And then you have a quarterback who’s different than other zone-read type (quarterbacks) you face where it’s a quick, agile quarterback that can break outside. Cam (Newton) can pound you, too, because of his size (6-6, 260). They try and wear you down and pound you. Their offensive line is built that way. Their running game is built that way. Can we stand in there and go toe to toe with them?’’ \n--Kelly said left tackle Jason Peters had his best game of the season Monday against the Giants. He said Peters has played well all season. “There’s a very high standard for Jason. I don’t think he’s played poorly at all (earlier). I just think you’re talking about a perennial Pro Bowl player. If Jason gives up one play where a guy beats him around the edge, it’s ‘Oh my God. What’s wrong with Jason Peters?’ Where if it’s anybody else, you don’t say that.’’ \n--Kelly said tight end Zach Ertz’s blocking has improved. “We’ve run a lot with Zach in the game and Brent (Celek) out of the game,’’ he said. “He knew it was something he had to work on to increase his game to be a complete tight end, and I think he’s done a nice job with that.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:43:27.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
