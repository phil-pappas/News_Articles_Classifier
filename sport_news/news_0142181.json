As a sophomore in 2009, he started two games in place of an injured Ricky Dobbs – rushing for 89 yards in a 13-10 victory over Wake Forest. \nProctor played in eight games with a start against Central Michigan in 2010 and therefore brought significant experience into his senior season when he succeeded Dobbs as the No. 1 quarterback. \nProctor performed well that year statistically, rushing for 914 yards and 14 touchdowns while passing 787 yards and seven scores. However, it was a disappointing season overall as Navy finished 5-7 – its only losing record in the 12-year span from 2003 to 2014. \n\"It was a frustrating season, no doubt. We had a really good team and should have won a lot more games than we did,\" Proctor allowed. \"I learned a lot more about football and life that season than I ever had before. I think you grow more during the tough times because you tend to remember those experiences.\" \nNavy lost five games by a field goal or less in 2011 and none was more heartbreaking than a 35-34 defeat at the hands of service academy rival Air Force at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. The Midshipmen rallied from a double-digit deficit to force overtime then scored on their first possession of the extra session. \nHowever, Proctor was penalized for taunting an Air Force player in the end zone – turning the point after touchdown into a 35-yard kick. Beleaguered kicker Jon Teague, whose missed field goals proved costly that season, had the extra point attempt blocked. \nWhile Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said afterward he didn't think an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty should have been called in that situation, Proctor's lapse in composure at a crucial moment became symbolic of the overall lack of leadership the senior class displayed that season. \nOffensive captain Alexander Teich was suspended for the following game for walking off the field during the playing of the Air Force alma mater. It would later be learned that defensive captain Jabaree Tuani was the ringleader of an off-campus party house where a female midshipman claimed she was raped. \nTuani was not allowed to graduate until three months after the rest of the senior class for violating academy regulations that prevent midshipmen from having any type of off-campus housing. \nProctor admitted during an interview with The Baltimore Sun in August, 2012 that he was caught cheating on a thermodynamics quiz during the spring semester of his senior year, an honor code violation that also landed him on restriction for spring break. It was during that time of reflection that he decided not to follow through with attending flight school. \n\"I was in my room by myself for a week and began to think, 'What would my life look like in a year? What would my life look like in 10 years?' \" said Proctor, who was required to pay back the cost of his college education, approximately $160,000. \nNiumatalolo, who stays in touch with Proctor through emails and text messages, said the youngster should not be faulted for electing not to graduate from the Naval Academy. \n\"Kriss is a good kid. Some of the things he did here would not have been a big issue at other schools,\" Niumatalolo said this week. \"I think Kriss would be the first person to tell you that, when he looks back, he would have been a little bit more mature about the military rules. \n\"It's pretty rigid and it needs to be that way. There are standards and they should never be lowered, but just because you can't live the military lifestyle doesn't make you a bad person.\" \nProctor enrolled at Boise State in the fall of 2012 and worked for the football program as a recruiting assistant. He got the position on the recommendation of Navy assistant Steve Johns, who was close friends with Boise defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski. \nAfter spending a full year as an unpaid intern while obtaining his degree, Proctor became a paid intern with recruiting his primary responsibility. He was responsible for overseeing the other interns for head coach Chris Petersen. \nProctor was promoted to quality control coach for the quarterbacks in his third year at Boise State, working under the tutelage of offensive coordinator Mike Sanford Jr., who now holds the same title at Notre Dame. \nThat relationship, and the fact Proctor impressed the younger Sanford, led to the full-time job at Indiana State. Mike Sanford Sr. is head coach of the Sycamores, who play in the perennially powerful Missouri Valley Conference. North Dakota State, which has captured 12 national championships, has long been the class of the conference. \n\"It's really good football – a bunch of outstanding programs and a lot of top-notch talent,\" Proctor said of the MVC. \nTodd Lamb, an Annapolis resident who was Proctor's sponsor during his days at the academy, is thrilled to see him moving up the ladder of the coaching profession. \n\"I couldn't be happier for Kriss that he's doing what he loves. It seems to me that he's in a great place,\" Lamb said. \"I know the decision to leave the academy was incredibly gut-wrenching for Kriss and his family. It's nice to know that he put an alternative plan together and is executing it.\" \nProctor said he feels \"blessed\" to have a full-time coaching job with a strong program so early in his career and said his success so far is a testament to the men he learned from, such as Niumatalolo and Navy offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper. \n\"I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunity attend the Naval Academy. The academic experience was second to none while the leaders you encounter on a daily basis are incredible,\" he said. \"I might not have graduated, but I got the education and I got the leadership training.\" \nProctor stays in close touch with former Navy football teammates who are now helicopter pilots, Marine Corps officers and Navy SEALS. \n\"That football bond of brotherhood is very real and very special,\" Proctor said. \"I have so many great memories of my days as a Navy football player and so many of the guys I played alongside will be friends for life.\" \nAIR FORCE @ NAVY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:46:52.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
