It receives no government funding.\nI would have thought my fairly gentle prodding in two previous columns might have convinced Presbyterian Homes’ leaders to rethink the public relations problems inherent in pulling the rug out from under the very people they are pledged to help.\nNo such luck. Now, they will have to spend money on lawyers to defend their actions instead of spending it on their residents who deserve it.\nThe three affected buildings are Mulvey Place, 416 W. Barry; Crowder Place, 3801 N. Pine Grove; and Devon Place, 1950 W. Devon.\nI’ve visited both Mulvey Place and Crowder Place, where I met with stunned residents who showed me what close-knit communities they had formed and told me how fearful they were of what now lies ahead.\n“If I go homeless, will one of you let me use your shower once a week?” Stanley Rumage, 68, asked his neighbors at Mulvey Place.\nHe meant it, having been homeless.\n“Seventy-one years, and it’s come to this,” 71-year-old Susan McCormick told me. “If anyone lives long enough, they’ll die penniless in this country.”\nAs I get older, I can see the truth in that bleak assessment.\nNot everybody gets to the end of their work career with a nice pension or enough savings to get them through to the end. Not everybody has family to help.\nFor the elderly who find themselves in that situation, there is precious little affordable housing to be found, which is why what little there is should be preserved.\nThe big problem in this instance is that Presbyterian Homes has been unwilling to seriously entertain the option of selling to other non-profit housing developers who would keep the residents in place.\nAld. James Cappleman (46 th ), who has been trying to help the residents, said Presbyterian Homes showed some softening on that point in a Thursday meeting with elected officials convened by U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois.\nPiers said the court action will proceed independently of any efforts by political leaders because Presbyterian Homes needs to recognize that its written and oral commitments to residents amount to legally enforceable “lifetime leases.”\n“These residents have the legal right to remain,” Piers said. “This is not an option. This is a legal obligation.”\nPresbyterian Homes officials did not respond. They’ve said in the past they have no such obligation.\nMargaret Lilek, an 82-year-old Crowder Place resident, is a name plaintiff in the lawsuit and spoke at the news conference announcing it. She used to work for Presbyterian Homes under different management.\n“I’m so disappointed in how Presbyterian Homes has taken another path and brushed us aside like we were nothing,” Lilek said. “They should be ashamed.”\nAshamed or not, they should honor their commitment.\nFollow @MarkBrownCST\nTweets by @MarkBrownCST", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MarkBrownCST"], "published": "2015-10-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:49:53.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
