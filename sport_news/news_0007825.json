The Tigers beat Greensburg in four sets Saturday to take the Batesville Sectional crown. \n“We are kind of in uncharted territory,” Providence coach Terri Purichia said of Tuesday’s match. “We don’t know the road of 3A very well. We are going to do our homework and try to be prepared, but it’s a very tough turnaround. It’s two hours away. It’s going to be a difficult match.” \nSilver Creek came out ready to play like it didn't want to give up its sectional title. The fired up Dragons grabbed an early five point lead, while taking advantage of the overaggressive Pioneers. Silver Creek had a good game plan, it defended, kept the ball in play and scored off of a lot of Providence errors. \n“They gave us fits in a lot of areas,” Purichia said. “I thought their defense played outstanding and they forced us into a lot of errors. We just had to settle in and be patient until the right shot came.” \nThe first set was a very intense. The crowd was nuts and both sides were exploding with every point. Silver Creek's duo of Alex Falcone and Courtney Pierce got off to a fast start and forced Providence into a quick timeout. \nThings changed in the middle of the set as Providence’s Marissa Hornung started to warm up. With the help of Lexie Libs, Hornung lead Providence on a fierce rally and it was able to steal the first set 25-20. \nThe second set was as intense as the first. Silver Creek knew it was a must-win and fought and scratched the whole set. The teams went back and forth and neither was able to build a significant lead. It came down to the final few points and Providence was to hold on and win the set 25-22. \nIn the final set, the Dragons came out with one last effort to take back the momentum, but they couldn't overcome the champion Pioneers. Hornung was killing everything Libs sent her way and others — like sister Jacquie Hornung and Alyson Bass — were catching stride too. The Pioneers cruised in the final set where they sealed the Sectional crown. \nMarissa Hornung led the Pioneers with 14 kills. She wasn't alone. Jacquie Hornung added eight and Lexie Libs and Alyson Bass had four each. Libs set up 21 kills. \n“They have had so much to prove all season long,” Purichia said of her team. “They were really waiting for this night the entire season. We wanted to prove to people that we could play with a class ahead. It’s very special. Anything after this is just icing on the cake.” \nSilver Creek was led by Courtney Pierce, Emily Reed and Morgan Knies, who had a combined 16 kills. \n\"We near we would have to play a near-perfect game to beat Providence,\" Silver Creek coach Jeff Zimmerman said. \"We felt that we play as good as we have played all year in the first two games. A few missed serves really hurt us. We pushed them to the limit, but we could not finish. Terri has a great team and they have a great shot at a state title.\" \nThe Dragons say goodbye to five seniors — Alex Falcone, Bailee Popp, Knies, Taylor Williams and Brynn Ware — who have been a part of a lot of success at Silver Creek. \n\"These kids are irreplaceable,\" Zimmerman said. \"Not only from a volleyball standpoint, but more important, they are great people.\" \nCHARLESTOWN SECTIONAL \nPROVIDENCE 3, SILVER CREEK 0 \nSilver Creek 20 22 15 \nProvidence 25 25 25 \nMATCH STATISTICS \nKills: Silver Creek — Courtney Pierce 7, Emily Reed 5, Morgan Knies 4, Ashlee Ullrich 3; Providence — Marissa Hornung 14, Jacquie Hornung 8, Lexie Libs 4, Alyson Bass 4, Hanna Mitchell 2. \nAces: Silver Creek — Karli Ware 1, Taylor Williams 1, Zoie Zimmerman 1; Providence — M.
