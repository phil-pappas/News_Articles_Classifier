(Jim Weber/The Commercial Appeal) October 16, 2015 - Southwind quarterback Kameron Williams is facemasked by Central High School's Shuntrell Briars during Central's game against Southwind High School Friday night at Southwind. (Jim Weber/The Commercial Appeal) Related Coverage Northpoint improves to 9-0; Central edges past Southwind Central 30, (8) Southwind 28\nCentral's Brian Puckett intercepted Southwind quarterback Kameron Williams as time expired Friday night, putting the final touch on a 30-28 win for the surging Warriors.\nCentral running back Rashad Haynes took the opening kickoff 82 yards for a touchdown. The Warriors' extra-point try was blocked, leaving them with a 6-0 lead on the road.\nThe Jaguars regained the lead in the first half and looked to be riding a wave of momentum behind Williams, who passed for 234 yards. He accounted for three touchdowns. One came on a 3-yard sweep to his left with 8:18 remaining in the second quarter, another on a precision pass to the back left corner of the end zone that Devarius Taylor snagged while tiptoeing the line, and the other on a 22-yard throw to Cortarius Wilson slashing through the middle of Central's defense.\nSouthwind was ahead 21-6 with 3:47 left in the first half. Then three touchdowns were scored in the final 169 seconds of the half.\nCentral put together a quick 68-yard drive, helped by two pass-interference calls and a personal foul on the Southwind defense. The drive ended with a 3-yard Cameron Cooper pass to Caleb Clear with 2:47 left in the second quarter. The two-point conversion try failed, leaving it at 21-12.\nThe Jaguars drove 76 yards, ending with a 22-yard throw from Williams to Wilson that made it 28-12 with the extra point.\nThere were 27 seconds left in the half.\nCooper then threw a 54-yard scoring pass to Lerik Shelton with nine seconds for the Warriors. They went into the locker room down 28-18 to the Jaguars.\n\"At halftime we challenged the defense,\" said Central coach Lynord Crutchfield. \"We told them they were there to make the plays in the first half but just didn't wrap up and finish.\"\n\"We told them to go back out there, and do what you did in the first half except finish the play — make the tackle — and we'll win the ballgame.\"\nThe Warriors controlled the pace of the second half, benefitted from a scrappy defensive effort and some slips by Southwind's defense. Pass interference calls and turnovers plagued the Jaguars throughout the second half.\nCooper threw a 39-yard screen pass to Jamerson Washington, who picked his way through the defense for a score, leaving the Jaguars with a 28-20 lead after the extra-point try failed.\nCentral hung around with a strong ground game, but Justin Cole blocked Kahlil Hodges' punt in the fourth quarter to clinch it for the Warriors. Teammate Robert Johnson scooped up the ball and ran for a touchdown to put the Warriors ahead for good, 30-28.", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/1017_masp_southwind_sat2.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*139/1017_masp_southwind_sat2.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/1017_masp_southwind_sat3.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*138/1017_masp_southwind_sat3.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-16T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:24:44.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
