There is no description of the suspects.\nA shopper who was inside the store when the gunfire erupted explained what he happened.\n\"I was at the checkout stand and I heard one guy say,' I'm not going out there.' He said, 'I'm not getting carts, there's bullets flying,' and I came out here and went 'Oh, no.'\"\nWhile police investigated, two dozen cars belonging to shoppers remained trapped inside an active crime scene. As of 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, many were still waiting to get their cars.\nPolice do not have any additional information about the two men in the Corolla, nor do they know why the men were meeting, but the shooting is not believed to be random.\nAnyone with information on the shooting is urged to call police.\nThe Target store appears that it will be open Thursday.\ncomment (13)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/HenryKIRO7/status/649427262387810305", "http://t.co/lRIPnJTQgV", "https://twitter.com/HenryKIRO7/status/649431936545390592", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://t.co/yjyTIFlzNY", "http://t.co/V0ChhhQAyz", "https://twitter.com/HenryKIRO7/status/649435162413895680"], "published": "2015-10-01T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:34:05.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
