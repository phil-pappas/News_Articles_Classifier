(AP) -- Jehu Chesson returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown and No. 18 Michigan scored on offense and defense to build a four-touchdown lead by halftime in a 38-0 victory over No. 13 Northwestern on Saturday. \nThe Wolverines (5-1, 2-0 Big Ten) have won five straight since their opening loss at Utah under coach Jim Harbaugh, building momentum going into a showdown at home next week against No. 4 Michigan State. \nThe Wildcats (5-1, 1-1) were giving up a nation-low seven points a game and gave that up 13 seconds after kickoff. They allowed a season-high 21 points in the first quarter alone and struggled on offense, too. \nMichigan has shut out three straight opponents for the first time since 1980. \nThe Wolverines scored TDs on a kickoff return, interception and offense for the first time since 1991 at Boston College, according to STATS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:42:45.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
