By Rick Peterson Jr. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nWith a handful of returners and a promising cast of newcomers, Washburn men’s basketball coach Bob Chipman is enthusiastic about the makeup of his squad entering the 2015-16 season. \nThe main question mark for Chipman is the youth of the Ichabods, who feature just one senior and 10 underclassmen (five sophomores and five freshmen). \n“We’re calling on some guys to get out there and be successful, and they’ve never played a game here yet,” said Chipman, who is entering his 37th season. “I like them. I think we’ve got some good players. But the transition from high school or not playing much somewhere else to now all the sudden being called upon to play at a high level, that’s a concern.” \n“But I’m ready for the challenge. I like who we have.” \nKey returners include senior forward Christian Ulsaker, junior forward Jeremy Lickteig, junior guard Andy Wilson, sophomore forwards David Salach and Brady Skeens and sophomore guard Cameron Wiggins. \nUlsaker is the leading returning scorer after averaging 6.7 points a game as a junior. \n“He needs to reinforce the winning things — running hard, defending hard and getting after the ball on the boards,” Chipman said of Ulsaker. “He’s been trying to do those things. Honestly, with some of the experience we’ve had over the last couple years, we haven’t concentrated on those things. But this group has to get up and get on pace in those areas. Christian needs to give us some leadership there, and he will.” \nWashburn is especially young on the perimeter, with Wilson the only upperclassmen at guard. \nChipman said newcomers Randall Smith, Javion Blake and Cole Johnson will be in the mix at point guard. Smith is a sophomore transfer from Jacksonville State while Blake is a freshman from Olathe East and Johnson a sophomore transfer from Oklahoma Wesleyan. \n“Honestly, they’re more natural point guards than what we’ve had,” Chipman said. “Hopefully, that shows in the win column. We’ve had great players in here, but we just haven’t had that point guard to keep us going in the right direction, getting everybody shots and initiating defense. We think we’ve got that in those three.” \nInside, the Ichabods added 6-foot-5 forward Robert Christopher from Highline Community College in Des Moines, Wash. Christopher, the older brother of Kansas women’s basketball player Jayde Christopher, averaged 13.7 points and 8.1 rebounds as a sophomore at Highline. \n“Robert Christopher is going to help us on the inside,” Chipman said. “He gives us great quickness and great athleticism. He plays with a big-time motor and has a great feel for team basketball.” \nOther newcomers include freshman guard Tyas Martin (Wichita East) and Emeka Ogbonna (Austin, Texas). \nChipman said his team will need to rely on depth. \n“Because we’re so young, to play a high level, they’re not physically going to be able to play too many minutes, so we better be deep,” Chipman said. “Our young guys are not going to be able to log the minutes of an Alex North. We’re counting on our depth.” \nWashburn will play an exhibition at Oklahoma on Nov. 6 before opening the regular season against Augustana on Nov. 13 in Las Vegas.
