Their small heads have pointed snouts. Adults range from 4 feet to nearly 6 feet long.\nThe agency says their main threat is loss of longleaf pine forests, which once covered about 90 million acres across the Southeast but were down to about 3 million acres in the 1990s.\nBiologists say 11 populations are known. They're in nine Mississippi counties and three in Alabama. Black pinesnakes are considered eliminated from Louisiana, where they haven't been seen for 40 years.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
