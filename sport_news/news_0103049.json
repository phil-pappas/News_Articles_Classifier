He added eight rebounds, three of which came on the offensive end of the floor, three assists and one steal. \nIn addition to George, fellow starters Monta Ellis (14 points) and Ian Mahinmi (16) finished in double figures. Mahinmi added seven rebounds, two assists and one steal in 18 minutes of action for the Pacers (4-1). Myles Turner and Joe Young came off the bench to score 11 and 10 points, respectively. \nCenter Timofey Mozgov led the way with 16 points for the Cavaliers (0-5), while small forward Richard Jefferson (14), shooting guard J.R. Smith (10) also reached double figures in the loss. \nThe Pacers started the game with a 7-2 run that saw Mahinmi convert a three-point play after being fouled while shooting a layup and then, take a pass from Ellis and hit a hook shot in the key. Mahinmi also assisted on the Pacers' other basket during the run, a pull-up jumper from George. \nThe Cavaliers trimmed the deficit down to two points, when Jefferson caught a pass from point guard Mo Williams, squared himself to the hoop and calmly buried a three-pointer. Fellow forward James Jones cut Indiana's advantage down to a point, 9-8, when he connected on a three-pointer with 9:11 left in the first quarter. \nHowever, that was as close as the Cavaliers would get to ever threatening the lead, as the Pacers rattled off a 15-0 scoring run over the next 4:20. During the scoring run, Indiana committed just two turnovers and missed only two of their nine attempts from the field. \nJefferson broke the Cavaliers' scoring drought with a driving layup in the lane, and Anderson Varejao scored the Cavaliers' final three baskets in the last 2:36 that cut Indiana's advantage, which once stood at 18 points, down to 12, 28-16, after the first quarter. \nAlthough the Cavaliers committed eight turnovers, the Pacers managed just one basket off the miscues. The Cavaliers, however, turned Indiana's seven turnovers into 13 points. \nJust like in the first quarter, the Pacers started the second period fast and their 10-3 run gave them a 38-19 lead over the Cavaliers with 8:20 to play in the half. Over the next four minutes, the Pacers held the Cavaliers to just three points, and when George buried a three-point shot at the 4:46 mark, Indiana had a 46-26 advantage, its largest of the night to that point. \nThe Cavaliers finished the half on a 12-7 scoring run that cut Indiana's lead down to 15 points. \nWhile the Cavaliers' offensive struggles continued, they managed to turn another five Indiana turnovers into six points during the second quarter. \nAfter being outscored in each of the first two quarters, the Cavaliers played even with the Pacers in the third period, as both teams scored 20 points. Defensively, the Cavaliers limited the Pacers to just five made baskets in 22 attempts, but they surrendered seven offensive rebounds, which led to eight Indiana points in the paint.
