Lions pivot will be new to him on Saturday night at BC Place when the Bombers (4-10) take on the Leos (5-8) in a huge West Division clash.\n“You tell me college players, and I don’t remember names,” the Bombers nose tackle said Thursday. “I’m not familiar with him.”\nIt turns out the two spent three hours together on the same football field. It was Nov. 3, 2012, when Anderson’s Northern Michigan Wildcats defeated Jennings’ Saginaw Valley State Cardinals 33-28 on the strength of 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter.\nAnderson had six tackles in the contest but wasn’t able to sack Jennings, who completed 17 of 30 attempts for 208 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. He also had seven carries for 23 yards and a touchdown. Anderson pointed out that quarterbacks didn’t drop back much in NCAA Division II football, so he wouldn’t have had much of a chance to get after Jennings.\nEven though Anderson doesn’t recall their meeting three years ago, he has seen plenty of film on Jennings to know he and the rest of the Bombers defence will have their hands full on Saturday night. Jennings, in his second CFL start last weekend, threw four touchdown passes and caught one from receiver Austin Collie as the Lions cruised to victory over the Saskatchewan Roughriders.\n“There has to be a lot more gap control,” Anderson said. “When you play someone like (Travis) Lulay we’re not going to expect him to roll out too much, sprint out. He’s going to stay in the pocket mostly and try to come up the middle if he’s going to run.\n“When you play someone that you don’t know, you’ve got that ‘if’ factor. We have film on Jennings. It looks like if his first or second option is not open he’s going. And he can move. He’s pretty fast. He’s running with a purpose. He’s not scared back there. It’s our job to put the pressure on him and see how he does under pressure.”\nPRECEDENT SET\nThe Bombers have had good success against young quarterbacks this season, which bodes well for the Blue and Gold when you consider Jennings will be making just his third career start on Saturday.\nWinnipeg beat Montreal’s Rakeem Cato in his second career start in July, and it was 1-1 against Saskatchewan’s Brett Smith in the annual Labour Day and Banjo Bowl games. It was just the fifth and sixth starts of Smith’s rookie campaign.\nThe Bombers had also never faced Toronto’s Trevor Harris and had a chance to win their first meeting against him in August were it not for a fourth quarter special teams gaffe.\nTOO MUCH TO DO?\nLirim Hajrullahu is last among the CFL’s nine regular kickers when it comes to field goal and convert success rates, but he is strong as a punter.\nHead coach Mike O’Shea doesn’t believe Hajrullahu has spent too much time focusing on punting, which wasn’t his specialty coming out of university.\n“No, I don’t think they’re related,” O’Shea said. “He’s still a good kicker. He had a not so good day. You can be a good punter and then have not so good a day punting. We ask Lirim to do a lot, and we asked Lirim to do a lot from part way through last year when Mike Renaud went down.\n“We put a lot on his plate, and he’s had one of those unfortunate days that all kickers have. I’m very positive that he’ll bounce back.”\nEIGHT CANADIAN STARTERS\nThe Bombers will be going back to eight Canadian starters for Saturday’s critical tilt with the B.C. Lions.\nWinnipeg could have made another move to get import placekicker Sergio Castillo on the roster, but American backups Ian Wild, Tony Burnett, Troy Stoudermire and Da’Rel Scott play important enough roles that they have to stay in the lineup.\nCanadian Kris Bastien will be the fifth starting receiver, playing on the wide side of the field. He will take over for American Kevin Cone, who failed to make a catch at that spot in last week’s 24-23 loss to the Edmonton Eskimos.\nDefensive end Greg Peach looked like he would be returning to the lineup this week after sitting out last Saturday’s game, but head coach Mike O’Shea said he needs another week of rest to heal his undisclosed injury. Derrell Johnson will remain at rush end opposite Jamaal Westerman.\nIt looks like the only other change to the 44-man roster will be Scott for Chevon Walker at running back. Walker was sent home earlier this week but has been placed on the six-game injured list since the team has to pay him for the rest of the season anyway due to his veteran status.\nEven though Paddy Neufeld left last week’s game in the first half due to an undisclosed injury, he practised for the second straight day on Friday and will start at right tackle. Selvish Capers, who made his Bomber debut last week, will remain at left guard.\nBLUE BOMBERS\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers need to be ready for another young quarterback in Jonathan Jennings\nBy Kirk Penton , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 09:02 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 08, 2015 10:06 PM EDT\nIn this the year of the injured quarterback, defences have often had to face a pivot they’ve never played against.\nEven though Zach Anderson has played against Jonathan Jennings before, the B.C.
