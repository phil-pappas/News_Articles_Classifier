It's his ability to disappear from games and then come up and score a quick goal, just like he did today. He's very good at that,\" Paul, a senior teammate, said after the top-ranked Flames tied Worthington Christian 1-1 with a Mount second-half goal. \nMount admits he's making a greater effort in terms of pace and intensity. \n\"I've worked on finishing and being more aggressive and stronger,” he said. \nThrough 13 matches, Mount has a team-high 60 points on 28 goals and six assists. Cochran is next with 10 goals and nine assists, while Paul has a goal and 14 assists, and younger brother Jared Mount has seven goals and an assist. \n\"We try to hide him and let him play to his strengths,\" Armstrong said. \"He likes to hide, so we let him hide, but then he shines in those moments when he breaks through. His job is to create chaos and he does well with it.\" \nArmstrong has challenged Mount to assert himself more as a senior but reassures him that he doesn't need to carry the team. \nThe Flames lost standout defender Stevie Brown to an ACL injury a month ago, yet Armstrong didn't have to revamp the defense because of his loss. \n\"We never draw up a game plan based around one person,\" the coach said. \"Does it hurt that Stevie's out? Of course it does, but we've got 14 or 15 other guys that can step in and play. It's a team sport. That’s what we're trying to build our team around.\" \nThe same holds true on offense. Mount might be the most talented scorer on the team, but others are capable of shouldering the load with him. \n“He’s always been a finesse player,\" Armstrong said of Mount. \"Part of moving on to the next level, if he wants to stand out, is he has to be more aggressive. I’ve told him that, he knows that, and he’s stepping that up. He’s got to find himself and his style of play. \n\"There's a fine line between finesse and being aggressive. Are you going to go crazy and not use any of your skill or do you follow your skill and not be aggressive? You have to have a combination of both at the next level. He's starting to learn that.\" \nMount would like to play soccer in college at either Cedarville, Mount Vernon Nazarene or Gordon College, but he's not close to making a decision. There's still a lot of high school soccer left to play. \nAt 11-0-2 and already claiming another Mid-Buckeye Conference trophy, the Flames are positioning themselves for another long tourney run. \nLast year, MCS won the Division III state championship, and two years ago, the team played for it. \n\"I think we're in a good position and we know the areas we want to improve on and we're seeing movement toward that,\" Mount said. \nAs for himself, Mount said: \"It seems a little more focused than last year.\" \nWith their senior scorer gaining more comfort in his role and everyone pulling in the same direction, the Flames aren't lacking in confidence. \n“I know it's cliche, but sky’s the limit,\" Paul said. \"We’re pushing each other every day in practice. It's an intense environment. Right now we're our best competition. We're the ranked No. 1 team in the state. I don't think any team in the state is going to beat us unless it's ourselves.\" \nrmccurdy@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:27:55.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
