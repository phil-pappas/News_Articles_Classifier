I have had a lot of injuries and been sick, and feel that is all away from me now. \n\"I just want to do my job, do my best in training and score when I get my chance in the match. Every striker is happy when he scores, especially when the team wins.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:09:08.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
