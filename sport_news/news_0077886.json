Brady then stepped up, but not before reaching back and patting his coach on the back, whispering something, and offering an appropriately winning smile.\nAfter that, it was all business. If you were expecting Brady to gloat over the Patriots’ 34-27 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, or to somehow weave “revenge” into the discussion, then you’re probably from Indianapolis, or maybe Pluto.\nIf you’re from around here, you know better. If there’s one thing we’ve learned about the Patriots and our post-Deflategate world, it’s this: No gloating, no pointing, no jawing into the earholes of your down-on-the-turf opponents, and absolutely, positively no dancing on the other team’s sacred logo.\nYou remember the dancing-on-the logo controversy, right?\nIt was January 2007, and the Patriots had just emerged with a 24-21 divisional playoff victory over the San Diego Chargers at Qualcomm Stadium. The Pats apparently did a lot of whooping and hollering on the field, as boys will do in the aftermath of a big victory, but the Chargers believe things got out of hand. Big time.\nWhat they saw was half-naked members of the Patriots, running up and down the field, shouting obscenities, drinking bathtub gin. . . .\nOK, it was nothing like that at all. But the Pats apparently did stomp all over San Diego’s sainted Bolt logo and mimicked the little dance for which linebacker Shawne Merriman had become known after registering a sack.\n“It was upsetting to see because they won three Super Bowls,” Merriman told reporters that day. “It’s like a guy on a fast break in basketball and dunking the ball and getting excited. You’ve won three Super Bowls. You don’t do that.”\nThe feelings of running back LaDainian Tomlinson were similarly dented.\n“I would never react in that way,” he said. “I was very upset. When you go to the middle of our field and start doing the dance Shawne Merriman is known for, that is disrespectful. They showed no class and maybe that comes from the head coach.”\nLordy.\nNow just to be clear, nobody’s suggesting that the Pats played it cool in Indy Sunday night in order to avoid unfavorable comparisons to that day in San Diego. For one thing, that was an almost completely different set of Patriots, and for another, well, there’s this: The best way for Brady to take his revenge on the Colts (besides winning, of course) is to ignore them.\nThink about that. After more than eight months of court hearings, high-school science lab projects and league-paid-for “independent reports,” Brady walked into the den of his accusers, defeated them, and then talked about it as though it had been the first preseason game.\n“I thought our execution was off at times,” Brady said. “But it was a good win, glad we won, it’s always good to win on the road.”\nThe only thing missing was the “yada, yada, yada.”\nIf you’re a Colts fan, this is humiliating. They’ve pounded the guy for nearly a year, called him a “cheater” and a “liar,” yet Brady can’t even be bothered to fire back. Instead, he submitted what for him was a garden-variety effort, placed it in his back pocket, and then yawned his way through a postgame press conference.\nEven if he had been able to toss out a light-hearted quip at the Colts’ expense, it would have enraged Indy sports fans. They’d have fired up the talk lines out there with all kinds of venom about how Brady is a cur, a villain . . . a cheater, a liar.\nBut Brady wouldn’t take them there. He got his W, and then he got his hat and went home. Time now to get ready for Sunday’s Gillette Stadium showdown against the Jets.\nBrady is now off the radar insofar as Colts fans are concerned. And you gotta feel for them: They are condemned to spending the rest of the week, and beyond, talking about that stupid fake punt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:28:39.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
