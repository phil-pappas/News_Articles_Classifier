Argentina, which demolished Ireland by 43-20 at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, will face Australia, which beat Scotland by 35-34 in London, while New Zealand will play South Africa. Argentina will be the outsider in the group but is a live contender. “We have played in the Rugby Championship for the last four years,” Argentina’s coach, Daniel Hourcade, said, referring to an annual competition that includes Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. “This has prepared us to play at this level of intensity on a weekly basis, so we will be ready.” Argentina’s return to the final four buried any fears that its first such appearance, in 2007, might be a glorious one-time event, in the vein of Bulgaria’s run in the 1994 soccer World Cup and Kenya’s in the 2003 cricket World Cup. Ireland, the team Argentina vanquished on Sunday, is the two-time defending champion of the Six Nations Championship, an annual competition among top European teams, and it usually plays well at Millennium Stadium. The Pumas, though, had history with Ireland, having earned their first World Cup playoff victory, in 1999, against the team and beaten it to clinch their pool on the way to the 2007 semifinals. This time, in a gripping, fluctuating contest, Argentina led from the start. It swept to a 17-point lead in the first 13 minutes and then allowed Ireland to claw its way back, to the point where its fly-half Ian Madigan could have tied the score at 23-23 with a 59th-minute penalty. Madigan’s shot slid outside the post, though, and Ireland did not get as close again. “Getting back to 23-23 would have been a massive confidence boost for a team which was probably lacking a bit of experience,” said Ireland’s coach, Joe Schmidt, who was missing four first-choice players and lost a fifth, wing Tommy Bowe, to an early injury. Instead, Argentina pulled away with late tries by fullback Joaquín Tuculet and the brilliant wing Juan Imhoff, and fly-half Nicolás Sánchez, named the man of the match, took his points tally with the boot to 23. “I don’t know how to explain it,” said Argentina’s ecstatic captain, Agustín Creevy. “We have been looking for this for a long time. I can’t come to terms with it. We’re in the semifinal.” This was no fluke, and Argentina’s play offered one answer to a question bandied about on Saturday night, after France fell to New Zealand in a record loss: Whatever happened to the flair of the French? It seems possible that it moved south and crossed the Atlantic: Argentina’s devastating opening — with slick passing involving both backs and forwards, players seeking space rather than contact and the whole width of the field being used — had echoes of French teams at their best. A brilliant first try, after less than three minutes, epitomized those virtues. Tuculet leapt to reclaim a high kick deep in Irish territory, and back rower Pablo Matera drove forward. When Argentina moved the ball fast to the right, back rower Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe nonchalantly picked a poor pass off his toes and unloaded a long pass that put wing Santiago Cordero into space. He drew the final defender to send center Matías Moroni over in the corner. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:26:47.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
