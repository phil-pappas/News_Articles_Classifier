Kirui completed the 5K course in 15 minutes, 46 seconds. He was five seconds ahead of runner up Jason Trevino (15:51). Clint Bell finished third in 16:02, and Agustin Hernandez was fourth overall in 16:25.\nPortland, Maine's Michelle Lilienthal won the women's overall title in 17:23 and placed sixth overall. Women's runner-up Michelle Gaye of Coppell finished seventh overall in 17:45. Bree Schrader of Austin was the third woman and placed eighth overall in 17:58.\nMichelle Huff of Evening Shade, Ariz. captured the survivor title, finishing in 22:30. Valley View's Tawni Luke and Plano's Gennifer Stratton, both previous survivor division winners, placed second and third in 22:41 and 24:24, respectively.\nNumerous area runners were disappointed that the event didn't present age group awards. Age group results were released in 10-year increments rather than the traditional five-year divisions.\nDallas Komen Chapter's interim executive director, Chris Packard, said there have been several changes in leadership over the months leading up to the race. Many race-day details needed attention including the overall participation and survivor experience.\n\"It was an oversight,\" Packard said. \"We heard it loud and clear. Age-group awards will be back next year.\"\nBriefly : Clyde Shank finished his 50 States quest for the second time at Saturday's Monster Mash Marathon in Dover, Delaware ...
