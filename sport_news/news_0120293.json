This team, when we think of them, we’ll think of the word heart.” \nThe Knights had an opportunity to score on their first drive but had a ball dropped that could have led to a score. \nThey had first-and-goal from the Eastern Hancock 4-yard line, but were stopped, thanks in big part to a fumble that led to an eight-yard loss. \nThe Royals took advantage and took a 14-0 lead into halftime – a 55-yard touchdown run by Matt Bowman, and a 3-yard score by Bowman with about 43 seconds left. \nThat doubled when Devin Denny scored just 20 seconds into halftime on a 62-yard run, and added a 50-yard score about two minutes later. \nDenny added a 17-yard pass from Jarrett Lewis later in the quarter for the final score. \n“They have some good players,” said Eastern Hancock coach Jim O’Hara, whose team improved to 10-0 and advances to face Indianapolis Howe in next week’s sectional semifinal. “They have some good size and our defense, we’re not real big. We have to rely on fundamentals and keeping low and our quickness. Northeastern gave us everything we wanted and the thing that turned was that goal-line stand when it was first-and-goal on the 5, we held them and then our offense took off, so we’re proud of our kids and our coaching staff.” \nIndianapolis Howe defeated Milan 57-35. Centerville defeated Switzerland County 21-0 and will face Triton Central, who defeated Union County 45-6. \nCole Retter had 21 carries for 76 yards to lead Northeastern, while Jacob Auger had 12 for 73, along with four completions for 8 yards. Connor Bray had five rushes for 18 yards and Alec Hughes added four rushes for six yards and had an interception on defense. \nNortheastern is only the third team to win three straight TEC titles. \nROYALS 35, \nNortheastern 0 0 0 0 -- 0 \nEastern Hancock 0 14 21 0 -- 35 \nSecond Quarter \nEH- Matt Bowman 55 run, 6:46 (2-point pass) \nEH- Bowman 3 run, :42.3 (kick failed) \nThird Quarter \nEH- Devin Denny 62 run, 11:40 (A.
