Refocused and determined, the Firebirds broke the stalemate less than five minutes after their 45-minute hiatus from action. Their 2-0 victory broke a three-game winless stretch. \nFree State coach Kelly Barah knew he didn’t have to say much during what amounted to an extended halftime in the 45th minute of play. \n“I think my team came out really lethargic today,” Barah said. “So I let them sit, and we knew we were a better team than what we had done in the first half. The break kind of gave them a little more time to think about the game.” \nSenior forward Eduardo Carballido Flores said the locker room discussions during the wait centered on finishing chances and reminding each other they didn’t have to obliterate their kicks on every shot that came around. \n“Good thing we came out of the locker room and played pretty good,” Flores said. “We kept up the intensity. I’m real happy about that.” \nIn the 48th minute, FSHS senior midfielder Will Laufer, who had taken two solid cracks at the net in the first half, saw his chance to get the Firebirds back on track. Playing the ball from the left side, Laufer sent it to the bottom-left corner, and senior O-South goalkeeper Max Carnes couldn’t get a read on it. \n“It was wet, so I tried to hit it hard near post and have it bounce,” Laufer said. “He thought it was gonna bounce out, and it just went in the corner.” \nThe score proved to be a breaking point for Free State (8-5-1), which was coming off a loss, a tie and an overtime loss in its last three outings. In the 53rd minute, Flores saw the keeper going right as Laufer won a ball about 20 yards out, and when Laufer tipped it in his direction, Flores re-directed it to the open right side of the net with a slide tackle and a soft touch from his left foot. \n“It feels pretty good, especially after what happened on Tuesday,” Flores said, referring to a 2-1 loss to Sunflower League power Shawnee Mission East. \nBarah thinks Free State is playing winning soccer now— and did so in its OT loss as well. \nLaufer already was looking forward to next week, and the final two games of the regular season: “We need to be on a winning streak going into the postseason.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:00:17.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
