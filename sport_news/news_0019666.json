Murphy, who entered NLCS Game 3 batting .357/.379/.929 this postseason, now has six homers in the 2015 playoffs -- three of which came in the NLDS win over the Dodgers. Beltran in 2004 had a total of eight homers in 12 postseason games. \nMurphy, 30, is eligible for free agency this upcoming offseason.\n\nYep: Daniel Murphy did it again.
