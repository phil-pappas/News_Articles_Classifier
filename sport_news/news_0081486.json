He has ordered a top-level probe into the bombings.\nThere have been growing indications that the authorities are focusing on possible parallels or even links to a July 20 suicide bombing at a peace rally in Suruc on the Syrian border that killed 34.\nThe government blamed IS for that attack, which also targeted a gathering of pro-Kurdish and leftist activists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:43:55.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
