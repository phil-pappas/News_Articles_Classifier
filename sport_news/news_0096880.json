He said the experts will continue their technical checks through Saturday.\nThe military's efforts come after two explorers claimed to have found a Nazi train trapped in a tunnel that they say could contain both armaments and precious minerals. The explorers' claim awaits confirmation, but it has sparked hopes it could be a Nazi train laden with treasure that local legend says went missing at the end of World War II. The train was reportedly booby-trapped with weapons.\nDuring the war, Walbrzych was still part of Germany. Called Waldenburg, it was in an area where Adolf Hitler was building a system of secret underground tunnels. The legend says the so-called \"gold train\" entered one of the tunnels while fleeing the advancing Soviet army in 1945 and was never seen again.\nThough there's no evidence the train even existed, news of the possible discovery has sparked global fascination in the case and a local gold rush.\nThe two explorers, a German and a Pole, say they used ground-penetrating radar to locate the train. The men want a reward of 10 percent of the value of the train's contents.\nBut it's not clear how things will turn out, even if a train is found. Last week prosecutors said they were investigating whether the men committed a crime by conducting a search with radar equipment without official permission.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:05:36.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
