The winner of Game 5 will move on to play the Cubs in the NLCS. The loser? They go home. \nWith some help from the win probability data at FanGraphs -- in a nutshell, win probability tells you each team's chances of winning the game at any point based on historical data; it's a stat more for storytelling than hardcore analysis -- here are the four more pivotal moments of Game 4. \n1. Dodgers do damage with two outs. \nAs the Dodgers learned in Game 3, jumping out to an early 3-0 lead doesn't guarantee victory. Of course, they would have been thrilled with an early 3-0 lead in Game 4, and that's exactly what they got thanks to a two-out rally. Here's the three-run rally they were able to string together against Steven Matz : \nClayton Kershaw singled with one out but was erased on Enrique Hernandez 's fielder's choice. With two outs and the men on first, the Dodgers strung together three straight hits to score three runs. Howie Kendrick 's single was a ground ball with eyes and Adrian Gonzalez 's single was a bloop, but Justin Turner 's double was a legit line drive down he line. To the action footage: \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nAt the start of the inning, the win probability was split evenly at 50.0 percent. Following Turner's double, the Dodgers had increased their odds of winning to 82.7 percent. \n2. Murphy puts the Mets on the board. \nIn Game 1 the Mets scored their first run on a Daniel Murphy solo home run against Kershaw. They scored their first and only run in Game 4 the same way. Murphy squared up a little cutter and drove it out to right for a solo home run. It wasn't exactly a mistake pitch, just a nice piece of hitting by Murphy. Check it out: \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThe solo home run brought the Mets to within 3-1 in the fourth inning. Los Angeles still had a healthy 23.9 win probability, but if the Mets were going to come back to win, they had to start somewhere. Murphy got them on the board. \n3. Kershaw gets through the seventh. \nThe seventh inning has been a bit of a problem for Kershaw in the postseason. Not just in Game 1 of this series, but in previous years as well. He got over the hump in Game 4, though the inning wasn't without some action. \nYoenis Cespedes started the frame with an infield single. It was a little swinging bunt along the third base line, and Kershaw bobbled the scoop, allowing Cespedes to reach safely. I'm not sure Kershaw would have gotten Cespedes at first anyway -- Yoenis can fly, man -- but the bobble was surely an unconfortable start to the inning. \nRather than meltdown as he has in previous postseason starts, Kershaw retired the next three batters on a foul pop-up ( Travis d'Arnaud ), a fly ball to center ( Lucas Duda ) and a hot shot grounder to third ( Wilmer Flores ). Boom. Seven innings for Kershaw in the postseason. The monkey is off his back. \nBy the way, after getting through that seventh inning, Kershaw improved his team's win probability to 89.3 percent. \n4. Jansen gets through the eighth. \nDodgers manager Don Mattingly took the seven innings from Kershaw and ran. He went to setup man Chris Hatcher to start the eighth -- Kershaw threw 94 pitches in those seven innings on short rest -- and he cut through the first two batters before walking Curtis Granderson . \nCloser Kenley Jansen came out of the bullpen for the four-out save and walked David Wright to put the tying run on base. It appeared Wright may have foul-tipped a pitch into the glove for strike three, but home plate ump Chris Guccione did not agree with catcher A.J. Ellis \nThe Mets threatened but did not score. Their win probility dropped to 5.7 percent after the eighth, which means the Dodgers' win probability rose to 94.3 percent. Jansen had a quick 1-2-3 ninth inning to close out the Game 4 win. \nClayton Kershaw helped the Dodgers force a Game 5 in the NLDS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:45:53.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
