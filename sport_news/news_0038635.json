Given the low expectations surrounding the Leafs, however, and the buzz circling the Jays due to the fact they are back in the post-season for the first time since 1993, the Jays have stolen their thunder. Dickey was asked about it. \n“I can speak from both sides of the coin because when we come for Opening Day a lot of times I remember when the Leafs made the playoffs a couple of years back it was kind of nice because if we got off to a poor start they always had the Leafs to talk about so it can work both ways,” he said. \n“It’s exciting, it’s great for the city, great for the fans that have supported us for a long time, they’ve been begging us to get to the post-season and now we’re here and we have a real legitimate shot of going beyond this round. I feel like we’ve got a really good team, a team that’s set up to go deep into the playoffs and World Series. It’s exciting for everybody including the people in here who’ve never been able to experience it. I’m 19 years in and this is my first playoff so it’s pretty special. \nHEAR ME ROAR \nThere is little doubt that Thursday’s crowd for the Division opener will be a noisy and boisterous group, what with the 386 year gap between playoff appearances. \nDavid Price, who toes the rubber in the opener, believes a home crowd can definitely help a team on both sides of the ball. \n“I really don’t feel that fans understand how they can have their hand in sporting events, maybe more so in football whenever you’re about to score on your opponent and you’re going into the noisy section or the student section, whatever it is,” he said Tuesday. “Baseball’s the same. It can turn 95 into 96. It can make that hitter get to that pitcher’s pitch. It pumps you up. I mean, there’s definitely, whenever you have that many fans and they’re that loud, it’s just that added element of ... I mean, everybody out there tomorrow’s going to have adrenaline, but it will take it to that next level and it’s a big factor.” \nIn other words, scream your lungs out. \nFACING GALLARDO \nThe Jays will have their hands full on Thursday if Rangers starting pitcher Yovani Gallardo brings his ‘A’ game. This season the right-hander has faced the Jays twice and dominated them both times. Over a combined 13.2 innings, Gallardo allowed just six hits and not a single run. \nSo how do you prepare for him? \nNot to worry said Chris Colabello. \n“We’re worried about the Toronto Blue Jays,” Colabello said. “He’s a good pitcher obviously but we’ve got to take care of us. We have to have competitive ABs one through nine, whoever’s in there, whatever the situation is. When our pitchers have to go out and execute pitches we have to play defence and then let the cards fall where they may. Baseball’s a funny game. On any given day you can score 10 runs off a guy or you can score none. Chris Archer (of Tampa Bay) had pretty good success against us until that day here (Sept. 26) when I think we put a nine spot on him. At the end of the day you start the game zero-zero and when the game’s over after nine innings we’ll see where we’re at.” \nThat’s great and all but what makes Gallardo so tough? \n“He throws strikes, he’s a pitcher, he’s a really good major league pitcher,” Colabello added. “I don’t know the exact formula for success. I think guys that are around the zone, command all their pitches and that’s not just against us, it’s against everybody (have success). This is a lineup where if you start getting behind in counts it’s pretty dangerous. You start letting runners on base for free it gets pretty dangerous because I think we have the three-run homer kind of stacked through the lineup one through nine. To this point he’s kept the ball on the ground against us the two starts I remember and he’s thrown a lot of strikes.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:18:17.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
