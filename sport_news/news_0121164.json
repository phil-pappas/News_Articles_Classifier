Top FIFA sponsors reacted cautiously at first to the scandal and to Mr. Blatter’s subsequent announcement that he would step down, releasing statements that called for transparency and higher ethical standards. A few did not even mention Mr. Blatter . FIFA was well aware of the sponsors’ concerns, however, and said it would meet with them privately to discuss their concerns. That meeting took place in August ; Coca-Cola and McDonald’s were among the companies represented. Last week, however, Swiss authorities announced that they were investigating Mr. Blatter directly for “suspicion of criminal mismanagement and suspicion of misappropriation” of funds. A week ago, a group of officials from the office of Switzerland ’s attorney general arrived at FIFA headquarters in Zurich and, over the next few hours, interrogated Mr. Blatter at length, searched his office and took boxes of documents. The pressure from corporations like Coca-Cola, a long-serving FIFA sponsor and one of the organization’s five multimillion-dollar official partners, and McDonald’s, a World Cup sponsor since 1994, could make it harder for Mr. Blatter to hold on to his presidency until the election in February.
