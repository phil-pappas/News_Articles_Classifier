The Bison, ranked second in the Football Championship Subdivision coaches’ poll and third in the STATS media poll, improved to 3-1 overall. SDSU, ranked fifth in the STATS media poll and seventh by the FCS coaches, dropped to 3-1. A total of 17,348 fans attended the Dakota Marker game, breaking the previous stadium record of 16,498 in a 2013 game against NDSU. NDSU won the battle for field position throughout the evening and grabbed a 7-0 lead on its opening drive of the game. The Bison converted twice on third-and-3 before King Frazier found paydirt from two yards out to cap a 10-play, 69-yard drive. The Bison bridged a scoring drive between the end of the first period and start of the second, marching 68 yards on nine plays as Chase Morlock scored from three yards out with 13:47 to play in the first half. NDSU converted on third down three times on a scoring drive late in the first half. The last of the three conversions came on third-and-6 as Carson Wentz connected with Luke Albers for a 16-yard gain. The pair hooked up again two plays later for a 2-yard touchdown with 20 seconds remaining. After the Jackrabbit defense stopped NDSU on the opening drive of the second half, the Bison needed only one play on their next possession to push the margin to 28-0 as Wentz weaved his way for a 27-yard touchdown run on a quarterback keeper. The drive was set up by a 13-yard punt return by Eric Perkins after the Bison had pinned SDSU at its own 1 with a punt of its own. The SDSU offense began to find a rhythm later in the third quarter and the Jackrabbits appeared to be on the verge of cracking the scoring column following a 36-yard pass from Zach Lujan to Cam Jones and 10-yard run by Isaac Wallace, the latter of which set up first and goal from the Bison 3. Wallace was stuffed on fourth and goal from the 1 three plays later, keeping the shutout intact at least temporarily. After Je Ryan Butler forced the first of two second-half fumbles, the Jackrabbits converted on fourth down on their next possession for their lone score of the night. Dallas Goedert made a leaping catch of a pass from Zach Lujan and rambled 26 yards for a touchdown. Goedert ended the night with four catches for 63 yards. Fellow tight end Cam Jones added four receptions for 69 yards, while Brady Mengarelli recorded a team-high fie catches for 40 yards. Lujan ended the night 19-of-38 passing for 242 yards. The Jackrabbits, however, were unable to generate much of anything on the ground, finishing with minus-4 yards rushing on 15 carries. NDSU, meanwhile, tallied 202 yards on the ground and held a 39:19 to 20-41 advantage in time of possession. Wentz led the Bison with 54 yards on seven carries and completed 19-of-27 passes for 183 yards. Zach Vraa was his favorite target, collecing seven catches for 51 yards. Jesse Bobbit led all players with 13 tackles for the Jackrabbits, adding a forced fumble and pass breakup. Nick Mears contributed 11 tackles. NDSU was led defensively by Tre Dempsey with six tackles. Greg Menard added four tackles, including all three of the team’s sacks. The Jackrabbits close out their four-game homestand Oct. 10, hosting Indiana State.
