I continue to believe I can best serve the country and this conference as chairman of the ways and means committee.”\nBut outside a meeting of House Republicans on Friday morning Darrell Issa, the influential chair of the oversight committee, said: “Everyone is universally asking Paul Ryan to go home over the weekend and reconsider.”\n“Paul Ryan’s been meeting with everyone non-stop,” Issa said. “Too many of us have his phone number and know where he works out in the morning. He is dealing with the fact that this isn’t a job he asked for or even wants – but it may be a job that the conference needs him to take.”\nIssa has said that he will enter the race for speaker, but only if Ryan is definitely out.\n“There isn’t a race for speaker at this point,” he said. “What there is is every member trying to come to 240-some votes for a candidate, and at this point, that’s Paul Ryan.”\nIssa said he would not campaign until Ryan’s candidacy was “put to rest”.\n“Right now we’re in a holding pattern,” said Peter King, outside the meeting on Friday morning. Asked by reporters how the meeting went, the congressman from New York said: “Fine! We’re one big happy family. We love each other.”\n“Really?” a reporter asked.\n“No,” King said.\nKing said Ryan, an influential voice on budgetary matters who was Mitt Romney’s presidential running mate in 2012, was the only person with the clout to run for speaker. But King was damning about the situation.\n“I think it looks like chaos,” he said. “And it is.”\n“I hope Paul looks inside, I hope he finds that this is the right decision for him,” Tom Cole, the deputy majority leader, told reporters.\nJustin Amash, a founding member of the “freedom caucus” – the group of hard-right House Republicans whose backing of Daniel Webster of Florida may have precipitated McCarthy’s exit from the race – told the Guardian on Thursday: “There are a couple of individuals, Trey Gowdy and Paul Ryan, who would be acceptable to the whole conference.”\nOutside the meeting on Friday, John Fleming, another founding member of the freedom caucus, said the group would continue to support Webster “until such time as the number of candidates might change”.\nIn a hint that the freedom caucus would consider uniting with the conference behind a Ryan candidacy, he added: “There are a number of personalities out there”.\n“We want to talk to any new candidates,” Fleming said.\nJason Chaffetz, a declared candidate for speaker, told reporters he would drop out of the race if Ryan entered it. Webster, one of the last to leave the meeting, said he would not.\n“I’m going to run in the conference no matter what,” he said.\nDuring a House vote Thursday afternoon, Ryan could be seen talking with Gowdy – the popular chair of the select committee on Benghazi who was touted by some to become majority leader, back when McCarthy looked all but set to take the speaker’s gavel. On Ryan’s other side was Peter Roskam, also a potential leadership candidate.\nRyan could be seen speaking animatedly. At one point, he appeared to lean back and sigh with exasperation.\nMcCarthy announced that he was dropping out of the race for speaker in a noon meeting of the Republican House conference, a move which “stunned” the room.\n“I’ve been a fan of Paul Ryan since before any of this,” Gowdy told reporters including the Guardian outside the House chamber.\nAsked then if he thought Ryan would run, Gowdy said: “I’m going to let Paul speak for himself. He’s uniquely gifted and qualified for the position.” He also described Ryan as “the smartest kid in the class”.\nAsked who could unify the party, Gowdy referred to Pope Francis when he said: “Either [Ryan] or the fellow who just went back to Italy.” Gowdy has forcefully said on many occasions that he is not interested in any leadership positions.\nSources reportedly told the Washington Post that Boehner had called Ryan twice to ask him to run. Ryan was “undecided but listening”.\nPolitico reported that Ryan cancelled all of his fundraisers for the next 48 hours, after the election meeting on Thursday.\nShort of Gowdy and Ryan, it seems increasingly unlikely any candidate will be able to muster the 218 Republican votes needed in a floor vote that is currently scheduled for 29 October.\nIf none of them can get there, Boehner may be forced to stay on until a new candidate can be found.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/costareports/status/652211197840916483", "https://twitter.com/PRyan/status/652164886265401344", "https://benghazi.house.gov/", "https://twitter.com/apalmerdc/status/652220953699684352"], "published": "2015-10-10T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:57:42.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
