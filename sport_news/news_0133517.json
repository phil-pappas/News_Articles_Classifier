The unranked Huskies, who beat No. 29 Evansville Memorial in Tuesday's semifinal round, earned a 4-1 win over Evansville Mater Dei in Wednesday's Bosse Regional to advance to Jasper. \nJeff will be a big favorite to advance to the state finals for the second straight season and the third time in six years. \n\"It will be a good match,\" Cross predicted. \"It's semistate.\" \n\"You have to go out and play. Nothing's given,\" Asplund said. \nKooper Falkenstein dropped the first two games of the opening set to New Albany junior Rohan Reddy at No. 2 singles Wednesday. Falkenstein then won the next 12 games for a 6-2, 6-0 victory to give Jeff an early 1-0 lead. \nReilly said Falkenstein, who is now 25-0 on the season, may be the state's best No. 2 player. \n\"We feel good about whoever we play, he's probably going to win at 2,\" Reilly said. \"It gives our team confidence knowing that whoever we play, we can count on a point.\" \nCross, who is now 20-1 at No. 3 singles, earned the Red Devils' easiest win of the day with a 6-0, 6-0 decision over New Albany freshman Noah Keeler. His win gave Jeff a 2-0 lead just moments after Falkenstein's triumph. \n\"I feel like I played pretty good today,\" Cross said. \"[Keeler] is young but he's good a lot of upside in front of him. It was a hard match, but I happened to come out with the win.\" \nCross suffered from leg cramps in Tuesday's semifinal against Floyd Central. It was apparent early Wednesday there were no ill-affects. \n\"We were really worried about him,\" Reilly said, \"but there was no pain. He was fine in warmups, so I felt good about him. That was a strong key for us.\" \nIt didn't take long after Falkenstein's and Cross's wins for the Red Devils to clinch the title. Almost immediately after those two singles' victories, Asplund and Blake Winchell completed a 6-3, 6-2 win over Ryan Robison and Logan Conrad in the No. 2 doubles match for Jeff's third win. \n\"It's exciting to be the clinching point [for the regional title],\" Asplund said. \"I would say I played pretty well and I would say Blake played pretty well. We did what we needed to when we needed to.\" \nIn the biggest surprise of the day, Jeff's 19-2 No. 1 doubles team of Sam Coward and Jack Reilly dropped the first set to New Albany's Jacob Stevens and Nate Johnson. As they did yesterday against Floyd Central, Coward and Reilly came back from a 6-2 loss in the first set to win in three sets. The Red Devil duo blanked the Bulldogs in the second set and won the third 6-1 after winning 11 straight games. \n\"[New Albany] came out firing. They came out hot,\" Coward explained the first set. \"We started to play our game and playing it well and we were able to come back in the second set and pull it out.\" \nCoach Reilly agreed with Coward's assessment. \n\"Part of it was New Albany,\" Reilly said. \"I think after losing yesterday [to Silver Creek's Nate Eckert and Jack Hawkins], they were hitting on all cylinders. They hit some great shots. [Coward and Reilly] moved on and didn't dwell on the past. We got up 2-0 in the second set and I think that relaxed us.\" \nNew Albany coach Bob Dusch said he liked the way Stevens and Johnson responded after Tuesday's loss. \n\"I was disappointed [Tuesday] in my 1 doubles,\" Dusch said. \"[Wednesday] they realized they can play with these guys.\" \nNew Albany's win came at No. 1 singles where 2013 News and Tribune Player of the Year Logan Charbonneau completed a surprisingly easy 6-1, 6-2 victory over Jeffersonville's Brock Winchell. \nCharbonneau stayed alive in the individual singles tournament with the conquest. \n\"I played good today,\" he said. \n\"I can't say enough about Logan,\" Dusch said. \"I have to go back a long time to find someone with the mental focus that he has. He mentally gets tougher. I definitely think he's going to make some college a pretty good player.\" \nIn spite of the loss, the Bulldogs showed they are capable of competing with one of the state's top teams. \n\"I'm proud of our play,\" Charbonneau said. \"We showed improvement from the first time we played Jeff. I'm proud of that.\" \n\"I was very pleased,\" Dusch concurred. \"Jeff's got a very fine team. I totally expect them to be at state. Today gave us a little indication that we can play right with them.\" \nNew Albany is expected to six of its seven varsity players in 2016. The Bulldogs believe they will contend for the first regional title in program history. \n\"Jeff loses a lot, Floyd loses a lot. Silver Creek's not playing a senior anywhere, so they're going to be a lot better,\" Dusch said. \"I'm looking forward to it. These guys need to work and improve on some things. We came along a lot quicker than I thought we would this year.\" \n\"Next year we're going to win it,\" Charbonneau predicted. \nProvidence senior Landon Carrico advanced to today's individual Silver Creek Sectional championship with a 6-1, 6-0 over Corydon Central's Clayton Schreck. \n\"I feel like I played well,\" Carrico said. \"I feel like there are things I can improve, but overall, I thought I played well and got the [win].\" \nCarrico faces Charbonneau today. The two split a pair of matches this season. The match could determine the 2015 News and Tribune Player of the Year. \n\"Every play left is high quality and has proven themselves,\" Carrico said. \"Obviously, I have to stay in A-plus form or I'm not going to be staying alive.\" \n\"I want to win state,\" Charbonneau said. \"I'm capable of it.\" \nSILVER CREEK REGIONAL \nCHAMPIONSHIP \nJEFFERSONVILLE 4, NEW ALBANY 1 \nSingles: Logan Charbonneau (N) d.
