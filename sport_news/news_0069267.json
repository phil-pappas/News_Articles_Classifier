Texas knows it'll need its best performance of the season to defeat the Horned Frogs.\nHere are things Texas fans should know about TCU.\nRecord: 4-0, 1-0 in Big 12\nLast: Defeated Texas Tech, 55-52, on Sept 26.\nKey Number: 635.5: TCU's average yards per game. The Horned Frogs are ranked No. 2 in total offense only behind Baylor. TCU's offense will provide a difficult challenge for the Longhorns.\n1. Doctson a big threat\nSenior wide receiver Josh Doctson had a big day in the Horned Frogs' 55-52 win over the Red Raiders. He earned the Walter Camp national player of the week honors after his 267 yards on 18 receptions and three touchdowns performance.\nDoctson is TCU's season leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. He's caught 35 passes for 593 yards and six touchdowns in 2015. The Longhorns' secondary will have challenge trying to stop the Horned Frogs' biggest threat.\n\"Doctson makes unbelievable catches,\" Texas head coach Charlie Strong said. \"We know the ball is going to go to Doctson. That's where the ball is going to go.\"\n2. Boykin still a threat\nWhile Doctson has received an abundance of attention after his performance against Texas Tech, senior quarterback Trevone Boykin still provides a major threat for the Horned Frogs.\nAgainst the Red Raiders he threw for 485 yards, four touchdowns and added 42 rushing yards on 14 carries. He's amassed 1,470 passing yards and 14 touchdowns in 2015. He's also run for 190 yards.\nTexas will have to find a way to contain Boykin.\n\"Well, the key is (Trevone) Boykin and the thing he does is he can break you down and he'll take off,\" Strong said. \"He can run with it. He has the legs to run. And then he can make the throws.\"\n3. Green leads rushing attack\nWhile Boykin and Doctson have led the Horned Frogs' offensive attack in 2015, senior running back Aaron Green leads TCU's rushing threat.\nAfter a slow start this season, Green has had two great games in-a-row. Against SMU on Sept. 19 he ran for 164 yards and two touchdowns. Green recorded 162 yards and two touchdowns against the Red Raiders. He has run for 434 yards and six touchdowns this season.\nWith a combination of Boykin, Doctson and Green, TCU will be a handful for Texas.\n4. Defensive drop-off\nTCU's head coach Gary Patterson is known for fielding great defenses but this season has been rough thus far. With key losses and injuries, the Horned Frogs' defense has been far from its norm.\nThe Horned Frogs have given up 405.8 yards per game in 2015. They're ranked No. 82 in total defense.\nSaturday's game could turn into a classic Big 12 shootout with Texas' emerging offense and TCU's defensive struggles.\n5. Injuries continue\nA key reason for the Horned Frogs' defensive drop-off has been injuries. TCU lost senior defensive end James McFarland, junior linebacker Sammy Douglas and sophomore cornerback Ranthony Texada to injury.\nThe injuries continued for TCU this week when it was announced that junior wide receiver Ty Slanina suffered a broken collarbone and is out for the season.\nThe Horned Frogs got defensive tackle Davion Pierson back from injury but he didn't record a stat against Texas Tech.\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-10-01T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:11:38.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
