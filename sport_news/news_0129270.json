All this batted ball talk obscuring that Michael Bennett completely called out owner Paul Allen over Kam Chancellor. pic.twitter.com/9Hjfjun4St \n— Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) October 6, 2015 \n“Pay him! Paul Allen, 17th-richest man in the world! Pay him!” Bennett hilariously yelled. \nSorry to break it to you, Bennett, but the Seahawks owner has actually slipped and is the 51st-richest man in the world! Oh yeah, and they have salary caps in the NFL limiting what the rich guys can spend on their teams, sadly. But this makes at least two Seahawks players who are hoping Chancellor gets paid off after he returned to the team following a 2-game holdout.
