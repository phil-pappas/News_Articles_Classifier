There was a proposal, it was examined and refused.\" \nDynamo boss Kobelev, added: \"There were substantive discussions on Kokorin, but it didn't happen. We vetoed a loan. I believe that Sasha deserves more than a loan.\" \nMeanwhile, Nolito, who is also in the radar of Barcelona, has spoken about the Arsenal interest in securing his services during a long interview with Mundo Deportivo , saying: \"Well, you see everyone is asking for me, but I'm still here at Celta... \n\"What I know is that I'm happy at Vigo. I try to stay out of this as I have four and a half years remaining on my contract at Celta and I must respect my club. I am calm, what has to happen will happen, both in a good way or in a bad way. I'm happy at Vigo, focused on my work, I have targets in my head and I have to keep working.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:31:25.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
