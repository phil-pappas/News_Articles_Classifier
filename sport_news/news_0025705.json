Brian Jenkins said. \"It really bothers me because I really thought we could win that ball game. I'm really upset with this team's self-inflicted wounds. The fumble and not getting off the field on third downs, you just can't do that against good teams like Southern.\" \"First of all let me say my hat goes off to Southern. We played a tremendously physical ball club. They are a first class team with Coach Odum. Their guys know how to win. They showed that tonight and it's something we have to learn.\" entered the game in the fourth quarter and promptly threw three touchdown passes as ASU scored 20 points, but fell short in the comeback bid. There were two major reasons the Hornets could not complete the comeback and that was due to Southern's quarterback Austin Howard and wide receiver Willie Quinn. Howard completed 33 of his 45 passes for 355 yards and four scores while Quinn was on the receiving end of 12 of those passes for 141 yards. Neither team could run the ball as Southern (3-2/3-0 SWAC) entered the game with the league's leading rusher in Lenard Tillery. The Hornets held him to 55 yards on 17 carries and held the Jags to only 59 yards on 30 carries. For two games prior to this game, the Hornets had surpassed 300 yards rushing, but Southern made it hard on the Hornets rushing game. The Hornets managed to finish with 67 rushing yards on 33 carries. started the game at quarterback and had solid numbers completing 15 of 25 for 217 yards and a score. Duhart built on those numbers completing 12 of his 14 passes for 125 yards and the three scores. had another solid all-around game, but his main contribution came as a pass receiver where he caught a career-high eight passes for another career-high 112 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:18:38.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
