I felt like a batter.\" \nHe has his eyes on a permanent spot as Cook's opening partner, but knows he will need to make even more substantial contributions consistently. \n\"I've got to score some runs before I can think of doing it for years,\" he added. \n\"I just want to keep giving England a good start - which is really important here.\" \nAs for Rashid's rollercoaster debut, Moeen reported it was not too difficult to keep the leg-spinner positive - despite his first-innings none for 163. \n\"He took a bit of stick in the first innings. \n\"But we felt he bowled well, and there was nothing in it for him. \n\"We kept telling him his wickets would come. \n\"I didn't really have a chat with him. We just went out for some food, like we do, and talked about how we were going to bowl in the second innings.\" \nAfter Cook's brilliant 263, and Rashid's improvement, only bad light stopped England going 1-0 up. \nThey have another opportunity to do so in the second match of three, in Dubai, starting on Thursday.
