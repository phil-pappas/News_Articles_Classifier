On this Thursday they had gathered here to watch their new favorite team, the Buffalo Sabres , play the Florida Panthers . More specifically, they were here to watch the first regular-season road game for the future of the Sabres franchise. If only they could find him, lost as he was somewhere among the yellow, white and black jerseys trickling onto the ice for the morning skate.\n“Where’s Jack?” one friend said. “Do you see him?”\n“Oh come on,” Bob Eichel replied. “They all look the same to me.”\nPhoto: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images For Bob, it all felt somewhat strange, this tornado of attention for his 18-year-old son—the autograph hounds waiting in the parking lots, hoping to meet the No. 2 pick in last June’s NHL Draft that was held here in this very building; the banners of Jack hanging in the atrium of Buffalo’s First Niagara Center; the No. 15 jerseys sold in the team store; the massive boat the Eichels boarded the day after the draft, invited by the Sabres’ owners. Jack’s girlfriend, a former dancer, came too, so owner Terry Pegula asked Bob to consider the thought of what might have been had Jack pursued hoofing instead of hockey. “Well,” Bob replied, “I guess I wouldn’t be having steak and wine on this boat with you.”\nThis is why the seemingly perfect marriage between Buffalo’s blue-collar population and the Eichels’ working class roots in North Chelmsford, Mass., causes Bob to shake his head. He manages the Lowell warehouse of F.W. Webb, a plumbing company, which means waking up at 4 a.m. alongside his wife Anne, a nurse, and juggling vacation time so he can attend hockey games. Now his son is logging more ice time than any other rookie forward in the NHL while making five figures shy of $1 million this season.\n“Blue collar? Nah,’ Bob replies when asked if his son remains true to the family’s background. \"We love him, but his life’s a lot different than ours.”\nJack first left home at age 15 to join the U.S. National Development Team Program. He spent time abroad playing for the U.S. in Austria, Finland and Sweden, and then enrolled at Boston University one year earlier than his peers. His success and fame weren’t unexpected. Well, maybe some of it of was . After the Sabres drafted him, hope—call it Eichelmania—burst out full blown in Buffalo where Bob spent several days with his wife before flying to Florida for a two-game swing with his friends. Jack was squarely at the center of that revival.\n“They’re nuts about their hockey,” Bob says. “I guess they just want a winner.”\nAt last, the morning skate’s pack of Sabres scattered and Jack, finally spotted by his father, lapped the rink, h is curly hair peeking out from beneath his helmet visor. His jersey number (15) had only recently been changed because Jack insisted on wearing his rookie camp digits (41) until his roster spot was secured. His stick blade was wrapped in white tape, a personal choice he made later in life, since Bob always believed black tape camouflaged the puck better for beating goalies.\n“Doesn’t do what I tell him to do anymore,” Bob says with a parent’s acceptance. “Dropped all my idiosyncrasies.\n“A guy once taught me, if they like something, give them a little. If they want something, let them have it. You’re not going to be able to tell a kid what to do. I guided him. Then when he starts doing it on his own, that’s when you know he wants it.”\nAnd when was that?\n“His whole life. It’s all he’s ever wanted.”\nPhoto: Boston Globe/Getty Images As the morning skate wound down and the Sabres gathered in their stretching circle, Bob stepped away for a moment, the perfect time for his friends to gush, albeit in whispers, as though he might hear. Hockey lifers among them—two referees and a coach—even they sometimes wondered whether Bob downplayed his son’s success and ignored the hype, or whether he truly didn’t realize he had provided half the DNA and much of the advice for the most-hyped American prospect since Bobby Carpenter. Although they began planning this Florida trip when Buffalo’s season schedule came out, Bob insisted they wait to buy tickets for the game until they reached the rink.\n“I’ve got to make sure he makes the team,” he said, in typical pragmatic—maybe not realistic—fashion. “What happens if he sucked in preseason?”\nJack did not suck in preseason. In his first game, on the road in Minnesota, his shorthanded backhander was the only goal in the Sabres’ 1–0 win. He scored in his regular-season debut, too, dropping onto one knee and whipping the puck past Ottawa goaltender Craig Anderson , then raising his arm in celebration as the disc rattled around the cage.\nEverything the roaring First Niagara Center crowd saw and loved had incubated in North Chelmsford with Bob as the closest witness. He was there standing on the frozen pond at Roberts Field, the one with the NHL-sized nets near the local fire station, when five-year-old Jack begged to stay 15 more minutes and skate in sub-zero weather. He was there to drive Jack home from birthday parties, because while everyone else was sleeping over, Jack wanted rest for his hockey game the next morning. He was there when Jack started doing pushups in the morning before middle school and a friend, a high school coach, called Bob’s son’s skills “trick photography” because he was ready to play with 18-year-olds at age 11. He was there on those late nights at home, sitting in the living room watching the Red Sox when Jack walked through the front door and headed straight for the basement, the sound of thudding pucks soon rising through the ceiling and into the kitchen.\n“From the day I was born, the only thing I wanted to do was play in the NHL,” Jack says. “I wasn’t going to let anything stop me or anyone stop me, and I give my dad a lot of credit for always being there for me, always sticking by my side, showing me the ropes of work and work ethic and how to strive for something.”\nEdge How top NHL draft prospect Jack Eichel is building a pro-ready body by Brion O'Connor", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@Alex_Prewitt"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:41:34.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
