Avtar Singh Makkar should also step down,” he said Badal, five times Chief Minister of Punjab, was conferred the Panth Rattan award in December 2011 by the Akal Takht for his services to the Sikhism. Bajwa, who was here to offer prayers at Gurdwara Keshgarh Sahib for the peace and harmony in Punjab, said Badal had failed to protect the interests of Punjab, minority community, farmers and other sections of society. He said if he has any regret of his actions and wants to see Punjab live happily, he should immediately step down. Bajwa demanded a probe into the incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib from a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court. He alleged that such heinous crime can’t be committed without the involvement of ruling party. He said Badal was capable of doing such “mischief”. Bajwa also demanded a CBI probe into pesticide scam due which the farmers of cotton belt had incurred loss of Rs 5,000 crore. He alleged that Badal had weakened the farmers economically for his personal gains. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:57.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
