Just showing your teammates you're a hard worker and that you're not selfish was really the main thing I wanted to do. I wanted the guys to like me for who I am and not where I came from.\"\nThey certainly like him now.\nUSA TODAY\nFor No. 20 Toledo and Matt Campbell, little things lead to big success\nAfter a career full of stops and starts, including season-ending knee and shoulder injuries suffered in Toledo's second game last year, Ely finally is producing the way he once envisioned for the 6-0 Rockets. That's especially gratifying for coach Matt Campbell, who said Ely was the \"best scout team quarterback you've ever seen\" during the 2013 season he had to sit out and then worked extremely hard to come back from major injuries after finally getting a chance to play.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \"He easily could have said, 'That's it, I'm done,'\" Campbell said. \"He was meeting our trainer here at 5 a.m. all offseason because he knows this is how important it is to him, and to watch him make the sacrifices he has impacted our young players.\"\nEly has continually gotten stronger this season and might have had his best game last weekend in a 63-20 victory against Eastern Michigan, throwing for 327 yards and four touchdowns. He said he didn't celebrate too much after the Rockets' 16-12 victory over Arkansas on Sept. 12 because he felt he could have done more.\nToledo Rockets quarterback Phillip Ely (12) celebrates after defeating the Iowa State Cyclones 30-23 in double overtime at Glass Bowl. (Photo: Andrew Weber, USA TODAY Sports)\n\"We're still kind of finding our way as funny as that sounds,\" he said. \"Our defense has done a great job all year, and it's in our hands as the offense to really take control of some of these games coming up, and that's what we're trying to work for.\"\nEly said he has no regrets from his time at Alabama and takes pride in the fact he was part of two championship teams (he appeared in three games in 2012). He also sees some similarities to Nick Saban, he said, in the way Campbell talks relentlessly about \"process.\"\nUSA TODAY\nUSA TODAY Sports Midseason All-America team\n\"He's trying to create a culture and a tradition that will change the way things are done here,\" Ely said. \"At Alabama I wasn't the tallest guy or the strongest, so I had to get ahead in the film room and stuff like that, but I learned how to prepare for games, I learned what's important to be on an elite team, and I've used everything I learned there and in high school and I'm still trying to prove to people that we're a good team and all those type of things. I love being the underdog. It's what i live for.\"\nAnd it has translated to the way Ely has approached his time at Toledo. Though coaches sometimes question the work ethic of transfers who were rated highly out of high school and didn't work out at one of the blueblood programs, Ely has never used the label \"Alabama transfer\" as a crutch.\n\"I said this the first three weeks he was here, you had no idea he went to Alabama,\" Campbell said. \"Now everybody around here wanted to say, 'There's the Alabama transfer.' But he would never let anybody do it. He was as humble as possible and did an unbelievable job of building relationships. He's a tireless worker and a phenomenal teammate.\"\nTOP 10 GAMES TO WATCH IN WEEK 8\nWisconsin at Illinois, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on Big Ten Network USA Northwestern at Nebraska, Saturday at noon
