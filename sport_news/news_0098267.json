But McCaffrey is also an adept receiver and dangerous punt and kickoff returner. \n\"His all-purpose yards are off the charts,\" UCLA coach Jim Mora told reporters earlier this week. \"He's just a really tremendous player.\" \nThe combination of skills makes McCaffrey, whose father, Ed, was a Stanford receiver and three-time Super Bowl winner, one of the most versatile playmakers in school history. Advertisement \nIn the modern era, the shortlist starts with Darrin Nelson in the early 1980s, skips a decade to Milburn, then jumps a quarter century to McCaffrey, who is second in the nation in all-purpose yards (229.8) behind San Jose State's Tyler Ervin. \nAt his current pace, McCaffrey will challenge the Pac-12 single-season record in that category (2,890), which is held, coincidentally, by one of his childhood idols: Reggie Bush. \n\"The best backs are the most complete backs,\" said McCaffrey, who switched to uniform No. 5 this season to match the number Bush wore at USC. \"I tell myself that every day when I come to work.\" \nIt took Stanford (4-1, 3-0) more time to fully integrate McCaffrey than many fans wanted. \nMcCaffrey, whose mother, Lisa, played soccer at Stanford, was a heavily recruited prospect at Valor Christian High School in the Denver suburbs. He committed to Stanford in the final weeks of his junior year, then rewrote the Colorado high school record book as a senior. \nIt took only a few days of his first training camp for McCaffrey, with his speed and power, to establish himself as a threat to score from anywhere on the field. \n\"Ed came to one of the last scrimmages of training camp,\" coach David Shaw recalled. \"I said, 'If (Christian) redshirts, there might be a revolt.' \" \nMcCaffrey averaged 9.3 yards per touch as a running back and receiver but had only 4.5 opportunities per game despite the Cardinal's desperate need for production. According to Shaw and offensive coordinator Mike Bloomgren, McCaffrey wasn't well-versed enough in the massive Cardinal playbook -- and particularly in the pass protection schemes -- to warrant full-time duty. \nWhy not change the playbook to get McCaffrey on the field more often? \n\"That doesn't fit who we are,\" Bloomgren explained. \"I like to think of it as sophisticated simplicity. But if it's too simple, it doesn't take advantage of our greatest strength, which is how smart our kids are.\" \nMcCaffrey spent the offseason learning the playbook to the point that everything is second nature. He also prepared his body for a heavy workload, adding approximately 10 pounds of muscle -- his playing weight is now 205 -- without losing speed. \nInstead of discussing ways to get him on the field more often, the coaches now monitor McCaffrey's touches to guard against overuse. \nInstead of playing him out wide, in the slot and in the backfield, he is now locked into the tailback spot. \n\"From day one, I was thinking, 'Wow, who's that kid?' \" said Milburn, whose NFL single-game record of 404 all-purpose yards for Denver has stood for 20 years. \n\"He's making a name on his own. He's no longer Ed's son. He's a highlight reel.\" For more on college sports, see Jon Wilner's College Hotline at blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports .
