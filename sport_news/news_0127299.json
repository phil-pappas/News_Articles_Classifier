The celebration in Arlington may last all weekend.\nTrailing 33-21 with just over four minutes remaining last night in Arlington, the host Spy Ponders pulled off a miracle comeback behind an all-worldly performance from senior quarterback Alec Coleman (four rushing touchdowns), a timely onside kick and some last-minute magic to take a thrilling 34-33 victory over the Tanners on a night when Woburn coach Rocky Nelson looked set to record his 200th career win.\n“We talked to the guys about never giving up and believing in themselves,” said Arlington coach Ryan Gendron. “We kept believing in our guys and they pulled it off. That was a great high school football game. It came down to us having the ball last and we made the plays.”\nAfter Woburn’s Doug Amaral scored his third TD from 11 yards out to put the Tanners up by 12, Coleman stole the show. His 9-yard touchdown capped off a 10-play, 67-yard drive, which cut the deficit to 33-28 with 1:39 left.\nAnd after the Spy Ponders executed a perfect onside kick, Coleman did it again. His 4-yard TD plunge, which came after a pass interference call in the end zone, ended up being the final nail in the coffin on a night when Arlington (4-1) also rallied from a 20-0 hole in the first half.\nEarly, it looked as if Woburn (2-3) would hand Nelson his milestone win with ease. A Dan Moscat 40-yard run out of the punt formation gave the Tanners the early first quarter lead, and after Amaral rumbled in from 13 yards out later in the quarter, momentum was on Woburn’s side.\nBut after falling behind 20-0 early in the second on a 20-yard TD run from Moscat, Coleman scored on a 1-yard sneak before a 9-yard scoring toss to Clark Ewen made it 20-14 at the break. And following Amaral’s third score of the night early in the fourth, Coleman went 67 yards to make it 27-21, setting up the dramatic finish.\nIn other action last night:\nMarco King threw a pair of TD passes as BC High (4-1) held off Malden Catholic , 17-14, in the Catholic Conference.\nLuis Cardona scored two touchdowns, including a 63-yard punt return, to lead Everett (2-3) to a 49-20 win over Medford in Greater Boston League play.\nPerry Winn scored two rushing touchdowns as Andover (4-1) earned a 44-20 win over Lowell in Merrimack Valley Conference Large action.\nChristian Friedel ran for two TDs and Jack Masterson threw for two more as No. 3 Marshfield (5-0) took a 50-7 win over Falmouth in the Atlantic Coast League.\nSam Foley threw a pair of touchdown passes as Needham (3-2) beat Weymouth , 21-10, in a Bay State Carey tilt.\nMalik Williams put Natick (2-3) ahead for good with a 6-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter as the Redhawks defeated Dedham , 16-6, in the Bay State Herget.\nJulian Nyland ran for a 60-yard touchdown and threw a 53-yard touchdown pass as Melrose (5-0) shut out Wilmington , 34-0, in the Middlesex Freedom. . . .
