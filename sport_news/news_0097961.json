There’s a bigger storm headed FedEx Field’s way. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nThe Philadelphia Eagles have been told “nothing definitive” at this point about the potential rescheduling of their game Sunday against the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field, Coach Chip Kelly said Thursday. \n“There’s been nothing definitive in terms of what’s gonna go on,” Kelly said at a news conference at the Eagles’ practice facility. “When they tell us what we’re doing, if the plan were to change, then we’ll adjust accordingly. But there’s been nothing told to us. So we’re preparing, going out today. Today’s a normal Thursday [practice] for us, just like we’re playing Sunday at 1 o’clock. If they make an adjustment, then we’ll all make an adjustment.” \n[ It could be a sloppy game | Latest weather updates from C.W.G. ] \nThe NFL is discussing scheduling contingencies with the Eagles and Redskins because of the potential effect of Hurricane Joaquin on the D.C. area’s weather this weekend. \nModels of the hurricane’s path and forecasts about its impact on the weather in the Washington area have remained uncertain. \n“I obviously understand it. … If it does hit in some of the manners that it could hit, then it could really affect everybody, people attending the game, all the other stuff,” Kelly said. \nCBS Sports reported that the discussions between the league and the two teams have included the possibility of the game being rescheduled for Nov. 1, when both the Eagles and Redskins currently are scheduled to have a bye. \nKelly said he was not involved in the deliberations and did not know what is being discussed. \n“That’s all above me,” he said. \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:27:25.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
