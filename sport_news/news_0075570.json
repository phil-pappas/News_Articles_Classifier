Alex Galchenyuk broke a tie midway through the third period, and Pacioretty added an empty-netter. \nJames van Riemsdyk had a power-play goal for Toronto early in the second period. \nBernier finished with 27 saves. \nBabcock made the first coach's challenge in NHL history and was successful in overturning a goal. \nBabcock challenged Jeff Petry's apparent goal in the second period, arguing that Tomas Plekanec interfered with goalie Jonathan Bernier. Referees Frederik L'Ecuyer and Dan O'Rourke looked at the replay by the penalty box at Air Canada Centre and determined Plekanec made incidental contact with Bernier. \nMontreal defenseman P.K. Subban appeared to suffer a left leg in the third when he was boarded by Leo Komarov. Subban stretched his leg on the bench, tested it several times during stoppages and stayed in the game. \nNOTES: Defenseman Matt Hunwick, signed to a one-year contract July 1, was one of the alternate captains for the Maple Leafs, along with Tyler Bozak. ... Several Blue Jays players were in attendance as the Maple Leafs honored the baseball team for its first playoff appearance since 1993. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:58:39.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
