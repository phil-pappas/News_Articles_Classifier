Staff photo by Alex Resnak slideshow CANTON — Sequoyah continued its bid for a second straight Class state championship with a three-set sweep of Northside-Columbus on Thursday.The Lady Chiefs got off to a shaky start in the first-round match and trailed 17-11 in the first set, but they rallied off six straight points, and 14 of the set’s final 20, to win 25-23. After that, Sequoyah settled in, winning the next two sets by identical 25-16 margins.“We hadn’t seen (Northside) much this year, so it took us some time to adjust,” Sequoyah coach John Edwards said. “We knew who their hitters were, but we weren’t sure where they would come from or how they would hit it. Once we figured that out, we really played well. I’m really happy with the way we finished that match.”Area 7 runner-up Sequoyah (22-15) will play again Tuesday, either traveling to Brunswick to face Glynn Academy or hosting Lakeside-Evans.Kelley Hartman led Sequoyah with 10 kills. Deja Gross and Lauren Hartman each had six, with Marcelle Butler adding five.Annika Lanning kept the offense flowing with 22 assists, and Sequoyah also got a boost from its service game, totaling five aces.It was a team effort on defense, as nine players recorded digs. Karen Morris and Lauren Hartman led the Lady Chiefs with 11 each, while Mallory Lawson contributed with six.Butler had two blocks, and Gross was right behind her with 1.5.Home-court advantage proved to be a big factor for Sequoyah, as the impact of a large student section and pep band could be felt.“It’s huge to be playing at home,” Edwards said. “For the last couple years, we’ve had more and more people coming out, and the girls definitely notice. They play better when there are more people here and, on the other side, I think it affects the other team. They’re not used to playing in front of this many people and a band. It was a great environment.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:20:51.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
