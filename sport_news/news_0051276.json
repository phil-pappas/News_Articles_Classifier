Edwards (53) helps to stuff Purdue running back D.J. Knox for no gain on a third-quarter run. Edwards finished with a personal-best 16 tackles and forced a fumble. \nT.J. Edwards arrived at Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday morning with something to prove. \nOn the second defensive snap for the University of Wisconsin football team, the redshirt freshman inside linebacker combined with Joe Schobert on a tackle for loss. On the next series, Edwards stuffed Purdue tailback Markell Jones for no gain on third-and-1. \nThe hits just kept on coming for Edwards, who finished with a career-high 16 tackles and forced a fumble in the Badgers’ 24-7 victory over the Boilermakers. \n“It was good to just finally let it loose and start making some plays,” said Edwards, who was responsible for 1½ of UW’s four tackles for loss. “It’s about time.” \nIt had been an interesting week for Edwards, who was called out both privately and publicly by UW defensive coordinator Dave Aranda. \nOn Wednesday, Aranda met with reporters and said he’d like to see Edwards, who had 1½ tackles for loss through the first six games, be more productive. \nPlus, during a midweek meeting with UW’s linebackers, Aranda delivered a message that was heard loud and clear by Edwards and true freshman linebacker Chris Orr. \nWhile Aranda said didn’t mention any names when he said that “inside runs are killing us,” Edwards and Orr knew he was talking about them. \n“Me and Chris took it personal,” Edwards said. “I think we had to.” \nAranda stressed to Edwards and Orr the importance of communication and being disciplined with their eyes. \nEdwards felt it was his best week of preparation, and it showed as UW (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten) stretched its winning streak over Purdue (1-6, 0-3) to 10 games. \nIt wasn’t a mistake-free effort from Edwards. He was responsible for covering Jones on a 20-yard pass play in the fourth quarter — Purdue’s second-longest gain of the day — but made up for it by hustling and poking the ball loose for a fumble that was recovered by UW safety Tanner McEvoy. \nIn the third quarter, Edwards made a diving tackle to stop Boilermakers wide receiver DeAngelo Yancey for a short gain on third-and-9 deep in Purdue territory. \nUW got great field position after the punt and scored a touchdown to build a 17-7 lead heading into the fourth quarter. \n“He was flying to the ball,” Badgers coach Paul Chryst said of Edwards, who was a quarterback in high school and hadn’t played linebacker until he arrived at UW. “I just felt like he was playing fast and playing the game, and I found myself watching him.” \nEdwards’ job was made easier by the interior players in front of him doing their part to control the line of scrimmage. UW got steady play up front from Arthur Goldberg, who shifted to nose tackle and was joined by ends Chikwe Obasih and Connor Sheehy in UW’s base defense. \nThat gave Edwards plenty of space to be a playmaker and prove to Aranda that he could be more productive. \n“I’m glad he did,” Edwards said of Aranda’s sharp critiques this week. “It’s just that coach Aranda love that you need.” Jim Polzin \nJim Polzin covers the UW men's basketball team for the Wisconsin State Journal.
