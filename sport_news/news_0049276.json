Ales Stezka was equally as impressive for the Herd, stopping 30 of 31 shots, but the Herd came up just short. Aaron Miller nearly tied the game in the final seconds when he found himself with the puck in the slot, but Wischow got a glove on the puck at the buzzer preventing the Stampede (1-2-0) from leaving Fargo with any points. \nThe Stampede had an early jump in their step and started by outshooting the Force 8-2 in the early goings of the first period, but it would be the Force grabbing the first goal of the game when Jack Adams found the back of the net at 13:03. Blake Lizotte brought the puck into the left circle where he dropped it for Adams who wristed a shot past the glove side of Stampede goaltender Ales Stezka to give the Force a 1-0 advantage. Sioux Falls outshot the Force 13-10 in the period, but trailed 1-0 heading into the locker room. \nIn the second, the Force appeared to take a 2-0 lead midway through the period, but a goal was waved off when replay showed that the net had come off the pegs prior to the puck going into the back of the net and the game remained 1-0. Fargo went on to outshoot the Herd 13-7 in the period, but neither team found the back of the net and the game remained 1-0 Fargo after two periods. \nSioux Falls regained the momentum in the third period, outshooting Fargo 12-8, but couldn’t find the back of the net. Fargo nearly added to their lead with 12 minutes left when Stezka made a highlight reel glove save on Denis Smirnov. Smirnov stood all alone in front of the Stampede net and wristed a shot on goal, but Stezka slid from right to left and made a left-handed catch to keep it a one-goal game. The Stampede pulled Stezka in the final minute and nearly tied the game in the final seconds when Aaron Miller’s shot in the slot went off the glove of Fargo netminder Ryan Wischow and just wide of the net as the horn blew on the game. \nThe Herd outshot the Force 32-31 on the night and went 0-for-1 on the power play while going 4-for-4 on the penalty kill. \nThe Herd return to action Saturday night when they host Omaha at 7:05 PM inside the PREMIER Center.
