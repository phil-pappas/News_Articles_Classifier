In his mind, plainly, it is pretty much one style. (Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News) \nDetroit – Of course, Mike Babcock asserted that his first regular season game with his new squad, on the road against his former club of 10 years, had little to do with him or the guy he hired four years ago, who now coaches his old team.\nIt is all about how the players play, he said.\n“I think the storyline tonight is the Red Wings play the Leafs, two Original Six franchises, one that’s holding it’s rightful place and one that’s trying to get back to where they should be,” Babcock said.\nSame old Babcock, bringing the media up short and identifying the salient points from his perspective.\nAnd maybe recrafting reality, a bit, to the point that it helps him coach his team and manage expectations in Toronto – where the Blue Jays are the only thing keeping the sports news from being all about Babcock and new hopes for the Maple Leafs.\nAmong his greatest challenges in Toronto are keeping the fans and ownership patient for the three to five seasons it is likely to take to turn the organization around, and making a team used to a vastly different style of play into one that executes his system.\nHe says, repeatedly, that they have a long, long way to go.\n“Yeah, I mean first of all, I would say Babs has undersold his team a little bit,” Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill said. “They’re a very good hockey team. They’ve got lots of good players.\n“They’ve got lots of good two-way players. We play similar styles.”\nBabcock insisted the styles are more than just similar. In his mind, plainly, it is pretty much one style.\n“In saying that, they’ve been doing it for a long time and we’ve been doing it for a couple of weeks,” he said.\n“And so at the heat of the moment, sometimes you do what you used to do. That’s just the way it is.”\nWhat is his biggest concern?\n“Just like here,” Babcock said, of starting in Detroit, “it’s the fear of the unknown, and you don’t know how it’s going to go. You just focus on the process and trying to get better, and that’s what we’re doing with Toronto.”\nGracious in discussing his decade in Detroit, Babcock is also signaling it is time for him and the media to move on.\n“You know, I enjoyed my time here, I’ve said it a number of times,” he said. “I’m looking forward to this game being over, so I don’t have to talk about it anymore.\n“But I’m enjoying being the Leafs coach, too. It’s energizing. It’s way different, and it’s fun.\n“I met with Blash last night,” he said, for a recording of an interview with Mickey Redmond. “And I know he’s enjoying being the Red Wings coach, and he should be the Red Wings coach. He’s a Michigan guy. He’s done a lot to get to this opportunity, and he’s got a good team.\n“He’s going to have fun with that, and I’m going to have fun coaching the Leafs.\n“He’s a good man. He’s got a good family. I enjoyed seeing his wife and kids last night, when I stopped by there. You know, I wish him well.\n“Except when he plays the Leafs.”\ngregg.krupa@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/greggkrupa \n\nRed Wings at Hurricanes\nFaceoff: 7 p.m. tonight, PNC Arena, Raleigh, North Carolina\nTV/radio: FSD/97.1\nOutlook: The Hurricanes opened their season Thursday losing in Nashville…This will be the Hurricanes home opener…Hurricanes coach Bill Peters was an assistant, along with Jeff Blashill, under Mike Babcock for the 2011-12 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:26:58.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
