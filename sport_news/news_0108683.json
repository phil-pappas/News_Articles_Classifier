They were playing hard, but they were just making some mistakes that they normally wouldn’t make,” Woodrum said. “We talked and I challenged them a little bit and they really came on and played a good second half.” \nThe Redskins scored three straight touchdowns in the third quarter finishing the 12-minute period with a 42-7 lead. \nThis win makes next week’s game against River View even more important. If Coshocton takes down the Black Bears they will win the ECOL Grey Division title. \n“That’s huge because we want to send these seniors off with a win,” Woodrum said. “It’s also a county rival and you never want to lose to a county rival. If you do it stays with you for 365 days. With a win it will help us achieve a goal of ours also.” Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LTsEvx TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:37:32.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
