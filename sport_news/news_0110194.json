Photograph: World Archery \nD elhi lad Abhishek Verma has bagged India's first ever 'Archery World Cup Final' medal in the compound section when he won a silver after being pipped by Turkey's Demir Elmaagcli in the summit clash in Mexico City. \nThe 26-year-old Verma, an Asian Games individual silver medallist, capped an impressive campaign when he dealt a perfect 150 on giant killer Mario Cardoso in the semifinals but only to go down 143-145 in the gold medal match against Elmaagcli to settle for a silver. \nThe Mexican Cardoso had, in the quarterfinals, upset the top seed Mike Schloesser but the Wroclaw World Cup champion Verma was supremely strong in the semifinals as he had five perfect ends to cap the maximum, including six shots closest to the centre en route to a 150-142 win. \nBuyoed by his record win in the semifinals, Verma started with a 10 and a solid 29 for his first end to take a point lead in the gold medal match. The lead changed hands after each of the following four ends. \nA wild eight in the second set from Verma allowed Elmaagcli to take the upper hand at 57-56, before the Indian rallied to shoot a perfect 30. \nThe single-point advantage swapped back to the Indian with the score at 86-85 after nine arrows and it was at that point in the match when the Turkish pulled away. \nWith two consecutive perfect ends of 30 out of 30 points, the Turkish first won back the lead, then put the gold medal out of Verma's reach to win his country its first ever Archery World Cup title. \n\"You never know when perfect score is going to happen. Sometimes you just have a good feeling and this is what happened to me. It's been a great experience,\" Verma said. \nIndia will be hoping for another medal from Deepika Kumari, a three-time World Cup Final silver medalist (2011-13), as she will be making a return in the showpiece event. © Copyright 2015 PTI.
