The Boston Globe The most common place you used to find a pair of Bean boots was in some salty New Englander’s front hall, caked with mud and probably smelling a little funky.\nBut these days, you’re just as likely to see the Maine-made work horses on the feet of a finance bro on Wall Street as you are on those of a farmer in Vermont. Their relatively newfound popularity with those who work in jobs where keeping feet warm and dry isn’t a struggle means that these iconic shoes have been selling out well before the first frost arrives.\nThe phenomenon is so widely recognized that The Atlantic recently went so far as to take a deep-dive into the economics and manufacturing surrounding the boots , which are all made in Brunswick, Maine, a small town in the mid-coast region.\nSo what does L.L. Bean think about their best-selling boot’s skyrocketing fame and fortune?\n“We’re just tickled with the success,” said senior public relations specialist Mac McKeever. “We don’t want to disappoint people, so we’re trying to make the boots as quickly as we possibly can without compromising the quality.”\nMcKeever said that while the boots have always been popular in Maine and with anglers, hunters, and farmers, it’s their recent demand among high schoolers, college students, and “urban dwellers” that have been driving much of the demand.\n“It’s been remarkable to see it all unfold,” said McKeever. “We started seeing this a few years ago, and we began to take measure, because we had a huge surge in popularity last year, and we’re seeing same thing this year.”\nWhile L.L. Bean could just outsource the production and increase volume significantly, McKeever said that’s not the company way.\n“We don’t want to do that. We don’t want to compromise the quality or our company history and heritage,” he said. “This is the boot that started the company, and it’s still handmade in Maine the way it was 103 years ago. It’s part of who we are, of our corporate culture and our DNA as a company.”\nIt can take up to six months to train a worker to hand-sew the boots and operate the injection molding machine that makes the ridged soles. But L.L. Bean has always put quality first, McKeever said, as evidenced by their 100% satisfaction guarantee (which means you can bring back even the grossest pair of shearling slippers and still get new ones if yours have bitten the dust).\nAt the end of the day, McKeever said, current production rates and managing the demand all comes down to legacy.\n“We want to pay homage to the boot that started the company,” he said.\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Grandmother is first person cited by police for driving Uber in Portsmouth 10.20.15 | 2:28 PM Help the MBTA with its new look 10.20.15 | 1:41 PM A driver pulled out a hatchet during a road rage incident, according to police 10.20.15 | 1:31 PM This Google employee from Mass. saves money by living in the parking lot 10.20.15 | 1:04 PM L.L.
