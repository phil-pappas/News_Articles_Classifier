(AP) -- Darrel McHargue, who as a jockey won the 1975 Preakness Stakes and has been a racing official for 27 years, was named to the newly created position of chief steward in California.\nThe California Horse Racing Board announced Thursday that McHargue will handle daily supervision of all stewards at the state's racetracks.

He begins his new job Dec. 26, when Santa Anita's winter meet opens. He will work with stewards to review race films and discuss and evaluate decisions and rulings.\nThe 61-year-old McHargue won an Eclipse Award in 1978 as the nation's outstanding jockey.\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing California Horse Racing Board Darrel McHargue  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:27:56.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
