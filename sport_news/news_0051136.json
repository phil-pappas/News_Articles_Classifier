That’s a closer shave than Emanuel has ever endured.\nThe vote on the rest of the revenue package, including a $45 million property tax increase for school construction and a first-ever garbage collection fee capped at $9.50 a month until after the 2019 election, would have been even closer than that.\nBut it was held in committee overnight pending further concessions that may include requiring the Chicago Public Schools to make periodic reports on construction projects and shelving the mayor’s controversial plan to privatize Chicago’s 311 non-emergency system.\nThat’s a huge point of contention with aldermen because it would eliminate 73 jobs and threaten a quick response to requests for city services for which aldermen are held politically responsible.\n“The 311 thing has been a topic of conversation since the mayor introduced the budget and it continues to be,” said Ald. Pat O’Connor (40th), the mayor’s floor leader.\nThe City Council is required to follow a payment schedule for police and fire pensions outlined by state law or risk having the city’s share of state income and sales tax revenues intercepted.\nBut that didn’t stop a parade of aldermen from voting no on the four-year, $543 million property tax increase. They are Leslie Hairston (5th), Roberto Maldonado (26th), Jason Ervin (28th), Scott Waguespack (32nd), Nick Sposato (38th), Brendan Reilly (42nd), John Arena (45th), Tom Tunney (44th), Harry Osterman (48th) and Debra Silverstein (50th).\n“What you’ve seen is an expression of reluctance on the part of aldermen who represent the Gold Coast and lakefront areas where this is going to have the biggest impact and that’s understandable,” said Finance Committee Chairman Edward Burke (14th).\nBased on those 10 “no” votes, O’Connor predicted as many as 20 votes against the mayor’s budget on the City Council floor on Oct. 28.\nThat would fall far short of the resounding vote Emanuel was hoping to get to prove that the City Council is united in its resolve to “pull Chicago back from the financial brink.”\n“These are tough times and people expect that it’s going to be different than the days when you can pitch shut-outs when everything is going swimmingly,” O’Connor said.\n“Some people are being responsible in addressing the issues that are out there. And others feel that they want to duck it.”\nTwenty “no” votes would be a departure from the lopsided votes since Emanuel took office, but it would not be unprecedented during a difficult budget year. ​ After the 2007 election that would turn out to be his last, former Mayor Richard M. Daley raised property taxes by $86.5 million. The vote was 26-to-21.​ On Tuesday, Hairston said she voted “no” because she doesn’t trust CPS — particularly not after the contract corruption that culminated in a guilty plea by former CPS CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett.\n“They keep talking about the $45 million is for capital improvements. But the only things they have improved have been their own offices. And in light of what has gone on, I’m not confident they should just be given a blank check,” Hairston said.\n“There should be some type of explanation as to how CPS rolls out the capital improvement plans so we know what we’re voting on. I would not want to vote on a capital improvement plan that does nothing but build charter schools in other neighborhoods.”\nFor Tunney, there were a lot more reasons than that.\n“In my neighborhood, people don’t trust CPS. You’re asking basically to increase their property taxes by 20 percent. You’ve now decreased the police strength in my district by 20 percent. And we do not have a high school we can send our children to unless they win the lottery for selective enrollment,” Tunney said.\n“It’s really hard for me to be voting for these kinds of taxes without the confidence in — whether it’s Springfield or whether it’s CPS. It’s the frustration that I see and feel every day.”\nTo confront Chicago’s $30 billion pension crisis and eliminate the structural deficit he inherited by the end of his second term, the mayor’s $718.7 million revenue package includes a four-year, $543 million property tax increase for police and fire pensions; a $45 million property tax levy for school construction; a $9.50-a-month garbage collection fee to raise $62.7 million; $13 million in higher fees for building permits; a $1 million tax on e-cigarettes and $48.8 million in fees and surcharges on taxicabs and ride-hailing services that have siphoned business away from them.\nThere’s also a 15 percent increase in taxicab fares in exchange for giving Uber, Lyft and Sidecar lucrative authorization to pick up passengers at O’Hare and Midway airports, McCormick Place and Navy Pier.\nRide-hailing drivers who service the airports would be required to register with the city’s Department of Aviation.\nThe revenue package also includes a few surprises tacked on Tuesday.\nThey include a plan to make it a violation of city code to drive without insurance with fines ranging from $500 to $1,000 for the first and second offense to $1,000 for every subsequent offense.\nEmanuel also wants to require companies that “aggregate and sell” parking spaces, including those selling spaces through mobile apps, to collect the city’s parking tax, which stands at 22 percent on weekdays and 20 percent on weekends.\nYet another last-minute change would tie the annual permit for overweight trucks to the consumer price index to “better account for the impact of large trucks on city streets.”\nPrior to the vote, Burke led a chorus of aldermen demanding to know why Emanuel doesn’t level a tilted playing field that has allowed ride-hailing companies to siphon business away from taxicabs, endangering the taxicab industry.\nSpecifically, Burke demanded to know why Emanuel doesn’t require 20,000 ride-hailing vehicles operating on Chicago streets to pay the same $500 annual license fee assessed against cabs.\n“At least one alderman has expressed an idea that we can generate some more revenue out of the Uber, Lyft proposal and, hopefully, direct that toward police protection” instead of using $100 million in annual police overtime to mask the manpower shortage, Burke said.\nBudget Director Alex Holt noted that, in addition to a 15 percent increase in taxicab fares that would be Chicago’s first in a decade, the mayor’s plan allows taxicabs dispatch from an app to engage in “surge-pricing” similar to the multiplier that ride hailing companies use during periods of peak demand.\nThat was not enough to satisfy Transportation Committee Chairman Anthony Beale (9th). Beale noted that a citywide taxi app is still in the development stages. And he worried whether giving cabs the green light to impose surge prices would leave passengers attempting to hail a cab on the street out in the cold.\nTo appease aldermen dead-set against the idea and fearful that garbage collection would be privatized, Emanuel agreed to cap the garbage fee through 2019 and segregate the revenue generated in a separate enterprise fund. But those change were not enough to silence the critics.\nHairston opened Tuesday’s marathon Finance Committee meeting by asking Holt about the possibility of using 10 percent of the revenue from Chicago’s $630 million rainy day fund to “take out the garbage fee for now.”\nHolt diplomatically countered that such a plan would not be advisable and, in fact, would trigger “further repercussions” for a city with a junk rating that has already saddled Chicago taxpayers with tens of millions of dollars in penalties and borrowing costs.\nDaley sold city assets and spent most of the proceeds to balance his last few budgets without raising taxes. Without mentioning his predecessor by name, Emanuel has vowed to end such shortsighted practices.\nHairston also joined Burke in questioning why Emanuel isn’t proposing a dramatically higher property tax increase with an abatement to follow instead of assuming that Gov. Bruce Rauner will sign a bill giving Chicago 15 more years to ramp up to 90 percent funding of police and fire pensions.\n“I don’t want to come back to taxpayers and ask for more and more money . . . Why don’t we take one big hit and move forward,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:09:23.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
