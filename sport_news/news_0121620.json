Senior Brittany Gilbert opened with a kill en route to a team-high 11 and added five digs. \nRidgewood competes in arguably, top to bottom, the most competitive division in the state, the Big North Freedom. The Maroons’ steady blocking and digging led the NJIC Liberty Division leaders to commit an uncharacteristically high number of errors. \n“The struggle was we just don’t face that kind of competition on a regular basis,” Leonia coach Steven Corn said., “and we gave up groups of points in each game.” \nIn other first-round matches: \nGLEN ROCK 2, PASCACK VALLEY 1 (at Hillsdale): The No. 20 Panthers (16-5) were the lowest seed to advance.
