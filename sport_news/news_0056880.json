Tonight, the Hoyas take their improved defensive unit to Dallas with the hopes of shutting down the Wolfpack and picking up a Region 4 victory. Game: Harrison (3-2, 0-1) at North Paulding (1-4, 1-0), 7:30 p.m.Last year: North Paulding 49, Harrison 35All-time series: North Paulding leads 1-0Prediction: Harrison 28, North Paulding 21Harrison will have another shot at Kyle Banks, the North Paulding quarterback who threw for 3,498 yards and 32 touchdowns last season while leading the Wolfpack to the Class state playoffs.Of the 3,498 passing yards Banks mustered, 533 of them came against the Hoyas in Cobleigh Stadium, which resulted in a 49-35 loss.While Harrison will be on the road in its second meeting against the Wolfpack, its defense is playing too well this season to allow Banks that kind of yardage. But coach Matt Dickmann has another solution that could limit Banks’ offensive output.“The biggest thing with him, because he does a great job on offense, is keeping them off the field,” he said. “One thing we have done this year is not turn the ball over much. A couple of times, we’ve come up short on first down, but we got to keep their offense off the field.”That doesn’t demonstrate a lack of confidence in his defense, however. Dickmann’s has complimented Harrison’s defensive efforts all season. It hasn’t surrendered any more than 24 points in a game.Dexter Davis is tied for the Cobb County lead with three interceptions. Seth Simmer is third in the county with five sacks, and C.J Turner leads the Hoyas with 49 tackles.Dickmann has challenged his offense to move the ball, kill clock and score points, which has been its strength. Harrison’s offense couldn’t score enough against North Cobb two weeks ago before losing 21-14 in the 4 opener, but Dickmann hinted the loss wasn’t all self-inflicted.“A couple of times, we came up short on third-down plays,” he said. “One stalled on the 18 and we went for it on fourth down and came up short. We just can’t put ourselves in a hole.”The Hoyas will continue to rely on running back Darius Clark, who has led Harrison’s ground attack with 493 yards and 10 touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:40:54.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
