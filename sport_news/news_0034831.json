New York’s attorney general has sent letters to ... more > By DAVID BRANDT -   \nWatch any of the weekend’s college football games and it’s hard to go even 30 minutes without seeing a commercial for upstart sites DraftKings and FanDuel. \nAs a debate intensifies about whether the loosely regulated industry should be considered gambling, the ads are creating an uncomfortable association for the NCAA, which has strict rules for its players on sports wagering. \nBut the sites - which allow participants to pay an entry fee for a chance to earn payouts that can top $1 million - are perfectly legal for now in most states and dumping millions into advertising during college games. \nMany in the NCAA - including Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby - have made their position crystal clear. \n“It’s impossible to convince me that it’s not gambling,” Bowlsby said. \nA possible showdown is brewing for after the season when NCAA and conference executives are expected to see how - or even if - they can curtail the advertising or keep the sites from offering games that focus on college athletics. Ole Miss athletic director Ross Bjork said the avalanche of daily fantasy sports advertising has quickly turned the topic into a pressing issue. \n“My 9-year-old son is asking me every day about it,” Bjork said. “It’s all over television and even on his iPad. They’re obviously doing a great job of marketing, but it’s a concern.” \nParticipants on DraftKings and FanDuel can compete in games involving NFL or college players, paying an entry fee that goes into a larger pool. Then they try to assemble teams that earn the most points based on real-life stats in a given period of time with a certain percentage of top finishers earning a payout. \nEntry fees on DraftKings range from 25 cents to over $5,000. Some prizes top $1 million. DraftKings and FanDuel say the sites provide games of skill and not of chance and are subsequently protected by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act established in 2006, which has language protecting fantasy sports. \nThe games are legal in 45 states. \nThe Southeastern Conference has already banned daily fantasy site ads on its network as of Sept. 1. The SEC gets a little more say in its own network even though it’s owned by ESPN. \n“They did say (cutting daily fantasy ads) would impact some revenue for us, and we were willing to take that impact because we did not want it on the SEC Network,” Arkansas athletic director Jeff Long said earlier this year. \nBut the SEC also has plenty of programming on ESPN’s regular network of channels and CBS. Other leagues have other arrangements. \nAsking them to remove the advertising on their stations - and the ample amount of money that comes with it - is not nearly as simple. After all, it’s legal. \n“All those games that exist currently don’t meet some definition of gambling though intuitively it might seem otherwise,” SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:24:11.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
