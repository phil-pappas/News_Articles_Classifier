The sacks were Suh's first of the season as part of his dominating play against the Texans.\nSuh finished the game with two sacks, three quarterback hurries, three other tackles-for-losses and two passes batted down. Suh had gone the first five games without making an impact .\nThis is the Suh the Dolphins were expecting to see when they signed him to a six-year, $114 million contract in March. The Suh that consistently occupies double-teams and frees up others to make plays. The Suh that defies conventional logic about defensive tackles being simply run-stoppers and not able to produce sacks.\n\"If it's batting balls, getting sacks, getting tackles, helping free guys up to make plays, I'm all about it,\" Suh told reporters after the game. \"I want to be a part of the party , but at the same time I want to make a place for my teammates as well.\"\nThe Dolphins produce their second consecutive dominating defense performance under coach interim coach Dan Campbell . The defense that chafed under former defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle has jelled and clicked under Campbell.\nThe Dolphins have vaulted themselves back into the playoff race, but before they start getting too excited about the defense, the last two games were against Houston and Tennessee, teams with suspect offenses and a combined record of 3-10.\nThe Dolphins will play at unbeaten New England Thursday night. Suh and the Dolphins defense will be tested by Tom Brady and the high-powered Patriots offense.\n-- Geoffrey C.
