(AP Photo/Michael Probst) \nBERLIN (AP) — Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored and helped set up another goal as Borussia Dortmund beat Mainz 2-0 Friday to consolidate its second place in the Bundesliga. \nMarco Reus put the visitors ahead in the 18th minute with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang providing the final pass after Mkhitaryan intercepted a wayward pass by Mainz defender Niko Bungert. \nReus missed the chance to make it 2-0 after the break when Loris Karius saved his penalty kick. Bungert had been penalized for bringing down Aubameyang when he played the ball outside the penalty area. \nShinji Kagawa missed another great chance 15 minutes later and Aubameyang went on to miss two more. \nMkhitaryan finally sealed it in the 82nd when he rounded the goalkeeper after being set up by Aubameyang after a mistake by the Mainz defense.
