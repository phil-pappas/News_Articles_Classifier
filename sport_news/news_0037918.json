Noah Shaw looks so much like the eldest son of David and Victoria Beckham that even his parents can't tell them apart.\nShaw's aunt was the first person who noticed the teen's uncanny likeness to Beckham. She brought it to his family's attention after sending a photo of the 16-year-old model , noting that despite the age difference, the two boys looked nearly identical. Since then, the comments on his appearance have become more and more frequent.\n\"Iâ€™ve been stopped at school and out in public,\" he told the Daily Mail . \"At some places, girls have stopped to take pictures with me, which I think is really funny.\"\nShaw has over 4,000 followers on Instagram and several fan pages. Like Beckham, the teen has also been approached about signing a modeling contract.", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3260309/Teenager-looks-like-Brooklyn-Beckham-family-t-tell-apart.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:29:26.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
