The 32-point win at House Park improved Austin High’s record against District 14-6A opponents to 3-3, and it kept the Maroons in position to earn a playoff berth with games against Lehman (0-8) and Anderson (4-5) left on their schedule.\nThe victory also came six days after the team was thumped roundly in a 70-0 loss to Lake Travis.\nRalph Barrera Austin High’s J.J. Jacobs celebrates his first-quarter touchdown catch against Del Valle on Thursday night. Jacob’s 12-yard TD reception helped the Maroons to a 39-7 victory at House Park. “What happened to us, we wanted to inflict on another team,” said Austin High junior receiver J.J. Jacobs. “We just worked hard all week; we ran routes and did extra work. Coach said it was the small things we needed to get back to and we went back to the small things that got us better.”\nAustin High head coach Mike Rosenthal said the loss to Lake Travis left the Maroons feeling chippy at practice this week, and the team wasted little time taking out its frustrations on the Cardinals. Austin High never trailed Thursday, and the Maroons took a 24-7 lead into halftime.\nAustin High (5-3) scored on each of its four first-half possessions, and the Maroons’ offensive success was highlighted by two touchdown passes from Beau Kalbacher, a 5-yard scoring run by Marcello Mendoza and Eli Lopez’s 43-yard field goal. Using an uptempo but deliberate offense, the Maroons put together seven-, eight-, 11- and 15-play drives over the first and second quarters, when they had only two plays exceed 15 yards.\nRalph Barrera Del Valle quarterback Shatar McClay dives into the end zone on a second-quarter touchdown run. McClay rushed for a game-high 129 yards, but the Cardinals lost 39-7. “That’s what you’ve got to do, take what they’re giving you,” Jacobs said. “Sometimes you’ve got to be patient, you can’t just take the long shot. Whatever it takes to win, that’s what the coaches are doing.”\nAustin High continued to roll throughout the second half, and Kalbacher added a touchdown run and a 5-yard TD pass to Jacob Traudt to the scoring summary. Kalbacher was pulled at the beginning of the fourth quarter, but a drive that he started resulted in a 27-yard field goal by Davison Thompson, who recently joined the Maroons’ football team.\nAustin High’s offense was finally stopped on a fourth down-and-10 attempt from the Del Valle 31 with under a minute to play. The Maroons finished the evening with 177 rushing yards, and the team’s 276 passing yards were spread out between 10 receivers.\n“I thought we were very efficient,” Rosenthal said. “We were able to take what they gave us.”\nKalbacher complemented his four touchdowns with 263 yards passing while Mendoza led the Maroons with 72 yards rushing.\nDel Valle (2-6, 2-4) was led by sophomore quarterback Shatar McClay, who rushed for a game-high 129 yards and scored on an 11-yard run in the second quarter.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/22/87/97/rbz-Del-Valle-v-Austin-FB-15.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/22/88/ed/rbz-Del-Valle-v-Austin-FB-05.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:50:35.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
