The likeable Italian would be a popular champion should she overcome her seven rivals next week.\"I don't exactly know what my plans are as I need to first finish here,\" Pennetta told reporters on Saturday. \"I am really focused on my job, (I will) do what I have to do, finish this week and enjoy it a little bit as well.\"The Italian limped out of her most recent tournament in Moscow earlier this week and the highest-ranked players in Singapore, Simona Halep and Maria Sharapova, have also suffered troubled build-ups to the season finale. Safety first World number two Halep took a break from tennis after injuring her ankle at the start of the month, while third-ranked Sharapova has not completed a match since losing to Williams at Wimbledon, the Russian struck down with leg and arm problems.\"If I can stay healthy and work my way through the matches no matter who I'm playing, in this particular situation I have to worry about myself a little bit more than who I'm playing against,\" a wary Sharapova said.As the top-ranked players plan to adopt a safety-first approach, the rest of the field will feel they have a chance to join a prestigious list of WTA Finals champions with a good run in Singapore.Garbine Muguruza is the form horse in the field after the 22-year-old backed up her Wimbledon final loss to Williams with a maiden premier event title in Beijing this month but the fourth-ranked Spaniard played down her chances of victory.\"I have played really well this month and hopefully I can continue to do so, but I don't know if I can be regarded as one of the favourites,\" she said. \"The first time, sometimes it's hard to deal with so let's just see what happens.\"Of the others, double Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova will be gunning for a second WTA Finals victory to go with her 2011 triumph but the big-hitting Czech can be prone to erratic play and will need to maintain her focus.Round-robin play starts on Sunday when Halep opens proceedings against Pennetta at the Singapore Indoor Stadium before Sharapova takes on Agnieszka Radwanska in the night match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:26:37.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
