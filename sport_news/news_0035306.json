The 2015 NFL season hasn’t started off in a way Drew Brees expected, and the New Orleans Saints quarterback isn’t pretending like everything is perfectly fine.\nAdChoices However, per Katherine Terrell of The Times-Picayune , the 36-year-old said he’s trying to take the negative feelings and turn them into something positive .\n“I mean (I’m) not really happy with the way things are going thus far. You could say I’m a little bit angry, disappointed, frustrated, chip on the shoulder. I am harnessing that into something positive.”\nNew Orleans has trudged to a 1-4 start, including one-possession losses to a pair of NFC South foes in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers. The Saints certainly hope to avoid a clean sweep during the first round of divisional matchups when the Atlanta Falcons come to town on Thursday.\nBut, that won’t be accomplished without much a turnaround on the offensive side of the ball. Through five games, Brees and Co. have managed just 20.6 points per contest, which ranks 21st in the NFL.\nSince the New Orleans defense isn’t doing much to stop opponents—the unit has allowed at least 26 points during four outings—the onus is largely on Brees to excel.\nThursday night (8:25 p.m. ET, CBS and NFL Network) will show whether or not Brees has successfully harnessed the team’s shortcomings and created something more beneficial.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2015/10/drew_brees_you_could_say_im_a.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:42:21.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
