You can be a little concerned that LeBron James has only played in two preseason games and won't play again until the regular season tips off on October 27 in Chicago against the Bulls.\nThe Cavaliers announced on Friday afternoon that they have shut down their all-star small forward for the remainder of the preseason. The team is being very cautious with their superstar who has logged over 40 thousand minutes in his NBA career and has appeared in five straight NBA Finals.\nThe plan is too keep track of James' minutes this season with the addition of veteran Richard Jefferson. LeBron told members of the media after practice at Cleveland Clinic Courts that he received anti-inflammatory injection in his back earlier this week. James hoped that having the injection now will allow him to get through the 82 game regular season and the playoffs. Last season, James had to miss two weeks of the season in January after having a similar injection.\n“It’s all part of my maintenance program,” James said. \"I have to listen to my trainer and the training staff and the organization, so it's frustrating in that case, It's frustrating seeing that we're starting off the season with so many injuries.\"\nThe Cavaliers have been without Kyrie Irving, Iman Shumpert, Kevin Love, J.R. Smith, Matthew Dellavedova and LeBron this preseason because of injuries and rest. Then there is the holdout involving Tristan Thompson. With all the players missing valuable time this preseason, it makes developing team chemistry difficult as the regular season approaches.\n\"I don't think we will immediately be able to play at a high level because we have so many guys out,\" James said. \"I don't think our chemistry is where it needs to be to start the season off. I think as we get guys back into the flow of things, guys come back off of injury and we're able to put the time in on the practice floor, I think we'll be a much better team.\"\nWhile James will be shut down for the rest of the preseason, Love is expected to make his preseason debut on Sunday when the Cavaliers take on the Raptors in Toronto. Love has not seen any game action since suffering a dislocated shoulder in the final game of the first round playoff series against the Boston Celtics.\n\"I knew the process that I was going to have to take throughout the preseason, but it's been very challenging for us,\" James said. \"But we can't get too frustrated with the situation, even though it's early, you cant get too frustrated and understand that we will be better at some point.\"\nAfter Sunday's game in Toronto, the Cavaliers wrap up the preseason at Quicken Loans Arena next Monday against the Dallas Mavericks.", "external_links": ["http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/10/lebron_james_injection_cavalie.html#incart_river", "http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13900442/cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-gets-injection-back-likely-miss-rest-preseason", "http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/video/teams/cavaliers/2015/10/16/1445022903315-151016-practice-lebron.mov-61968"], "published": "2015-10-17T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:19:47.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
