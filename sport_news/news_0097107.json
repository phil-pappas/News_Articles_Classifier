(Photo: The Enquirer/ Joseph Fuqua II) \nMike Bohn has overseen the final renovations of Nippert Stadium and the drive to upgrade Fifth Third Arena, and the University of Cincinnati athletic director has been awarded more time to see it all through. \nUC has extended the contract of Bohn through June 30, 2021, university President Santa J. Ono said via tweet. Contract terms were not disclosed. \n\"When you have a great, enthusiastic leader like Mike Bohn you do everything you can to retain him #Franchise.\" Ono also tweeted. \nBohn was given a five-year contract when hired by UC on Feb. 6, 2014. Bohn replaced Whit Babcock, who left to become athletic director at Virginia Tech. \nThe 54-year-old Bohn previously was athletic director at Idaho (1998-2003), San Diego State (2003-05) and Colorado (2005-13). Tuberville: Kiel upset, wants to play \nWhen hired by UC, Bohn inherited a situation wherein the Bearcats had landed in the American Athletic Conference, being left out of the so-called Power Five leagues after the latest conference reshuffling. Bohn acknowledged that the chief goal was to get UC into a Power Five conference. \n\"That's the No. 1 priority,\" Bohn said at his introductory UC press conference. \nBohn and Ono since have worked behind the scenes to get UC into the Power Five, with the Big 12 mentioned most frequently as a possible destination. UC continues to work toward that end, but the Big 12 apparently is not looking to expand . \nMeantime, UC under Bohn reopened its on-campus Nippert Stadium this year after an $86 million renovation and expansion, which was begun in the Babcock era. \nThe UC Board of Trustees in August also took the next step toward moving ahead with an $85 million renovation of Fifth Third Arena , unanimously approving $2.2 million in design funding toward the project. Bohn recently said that more than $16 million has been raised toward the project, but the UC Board wants $25 million more to be raised by December before fully going ahead. \nBoth the Nippert and Fifth Third projects are being financed by private funds. 11 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1RYjT4e TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:23:57.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
