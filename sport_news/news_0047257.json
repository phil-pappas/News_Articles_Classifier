Some days he’s been working, some days he hasn’t been able to, but I think he’s on the mend right now.”\nLike Warford, linebacker Travis Lewis (ankle) made his return to practice Friday, but after sitting Wednesday and Thursday, Lewis is in danger of missing Sunday’s game.\nDefensive tackle Haloti Ngata (calf), running back Joique Bell (ankle) and tight end Eric Ebron (knee) missed practice, and none of them should be expected to play after being out all week. Ebron, though, was running behind the end zone of the team’s indoor facility during the inside practice, which is a good sign that he’s recovering.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:42:10.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
