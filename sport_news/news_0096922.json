That companionship has been especially beneficial this week. \nEvent organizers were left scrambling Monday when the host site, Quaker Steak and Lube in Beavercreek, abruptly closed its doors five days before the charity auction and car show. \nAfter some searching, organizers announced Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers, located at 1060 Patterson Road in the Breitenstrater Shopping Center, will host both the car show and auction. \nThat’s good news for Tom Michaels, the master of ceremonies. He’s hoping to again have the winning bid for the Brickyard 400 ticket package he won in 2014. \nMichaels, a WHIO-AM morning personality and Indy Car announcer, has served as emcee since 2007. It’s a way for the Kettering native to give back, and get a shot at those tickets, too. \nProceeds benefit the Society for the Improvement of Conditions for Stray Animals’ (SICSA) spay and neuter programs. \n“I’ve always been a big believer in SICSA. My family has gotten a number of dogs through there,” Michaels said, adding his mother and sister have also adopted pets from SICSA. “As a matter of fact, Toby the chihuahua is sitting with me right now. We didn’t get him at SICSA but he is kind of a rescue.” \nTicket packages to Bristol Speedway, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and Kentucky Speedway are among the items up for auction. An autographed racing suit from Rolex Series driver Didier Theys, a bottle of Richard Childress wine autographed by Childress, a race-worn tire from Kevin Harvick’s car and sheet metal signed by NASCAR drivers are others. \n“No. 1, it’s to help the animals. No. 2, come out and get some great bargains on any number of types of memorabilia,” Michaels said. \n“I go in (to SICSA) to get the licenses and I go back to see the animals and it’s all I can do not to bring them all home.” \nRed Dog Racers Charity Auction & Cruise-in \nWhen: Saturday \nWhere: Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers, 1060 Patterson Road \nSchedule: \n10 a.m.-3:30 p.m.: Race car display and cruise-in (no registration fee) \n11 a.m.-noon: Driver’s autograph session \n11 a.m.-2 p.m.: Silent auction \nMore info: www.SICSA.org/Red-Dog-RACERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:32:20.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
