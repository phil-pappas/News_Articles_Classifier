Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports) \nCan ASU make program history? \nThe Arizona State Sun Devils are 0-9 all-time against top five opponents on the road. \nThe Utah Utes are ranked fourth right now and host ASU this Saturday. \nBut this is why they play the games. \nMORE ASU: What goes into an ASU football road trip? \nEverybody counted ASU out against UCLA a few weeks ago, and yet the Sun Devils pulled off the big upset and turned their season around. \nThings won't be easy for ASU in Salt Lake City, but if they can play a full 60 minutes don't count Todd Graham's squad out. \nIt's also worth mentioning that ASU if 4-0 against Utah since the Utes joined the Pac-12. \nAnatomy of an upset \nAgainst UCLA, the Sun Devils had less penalty yards, more first downs, more total yards and dominated in time of possession. \nThat's how they pulled off the big, road upset. \nMORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL: USC and South Carolina open, what about Rich Rod and Graham? \nIf ASU wants to beat the Utes, they will need to win all those stat categories again. \nSpecifically, they need to make sure they win the third down battle. They need to get defensive stops and keep their own drives going. \nAgainst USC, the Sun Devil defense couldn't get off the field. The Bruins, however, were only 3-14 on third downs. \nIt was a major difference in the game. ASU Football biggest game yet KPNX \nThe last two years, these games have been very close, with last season's affair going to overtime. \nSaturday's matchup will likely be a battle to the end. \nWhatever team avoids making the big mistake will be victorious. \nStop Devontae Booker, force Travis Wilson to beat you \nIf you're ASU, you want to make Travis Wilson beat you. \nThe Utah QB has thrown for five touchdowns and three interceptions this season. His numbers don't fly off the page. \nNow running back Devontae Booker is a different story completely. \nHe's already rushed for 665 yards this season and six TDs. \nHe leads the Pac-12 in yards after contact and could be a difference maker this Saturday. The game plan for ASU should be very, very similar to how they attacked UCLA. \nThe Sun Devils stopped Paul Perkins and forced UCLA to get away from their game. \nIf ASU can do the same against Utah, ASU fans will be singing the fight song late Saturday night.
