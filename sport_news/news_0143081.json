You'll remember that last time Kanter came to Utah, he set the world on fire with his comments pregame, about how the Jazz's organization paled to Oklahoma City's, about how he hadn't tried his hardest in a Jazz uniform, and about how the only thing he'd miss about Utah were the mountains. \nHe then went on the court, solicited boos (literally, he asked the crowd to boo him), none of the Jazz players talked to him pregame, and played a fairly poor game as his team lost. \nNow, the Thunder have the right to hold Kanter out. And, as Ben Anderson, KSL.com contributor, noted on Twitter, it may be smart of them to do so: \nâ€” Ben Anderson (@BenKFAN) October 20, 2015 \n\n\"I want to see where we are in terms of our defensive discipline,\" Snyder said. \"I think in Hawaii, we played really hard, which can be misinterpreted as being good.\" \nNow, there's a need to show that the Jazz can do well defensively even when they are tired, against disciplined competition that will be difficult to be aggressive against. \nSnyder also used a brilliant analogy to describe what his team is going through: \n\"If you speak a foreign language, and you spend a couple years in another country and go back, it takes you some time. How quickly you assimilate depends on how deeply those habits are ingrained. When you have a team that's done them for about a third of a season, logic would tell you that's like a semester abroad.\" \n\nost\" in 2015-16. \nhere .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:57:37.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
