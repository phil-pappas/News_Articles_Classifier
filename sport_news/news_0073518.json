Chennaiyin played with 10 men from the 40th minute onwards after Harmanjot Khabra was given a straight red card by the referee for violent conduct. \nBefore the half time, NorthEast head coach Cesar Farias and his Chennaiyin counterpart Marco Materazzi exchanged heated words from their respective touchlines. This brought players and officials from both sides face-to-face and on the verge of exchanging blows and the match was interrupted for about five minutes. \nThe visiting team’s captain Bernard Mendy chased Farias and he had to be stopped physically by other players and the referee. \nAfter the referee blew the final whistle, Mendy again chased Farias and this time the players of both the sides were involved in a scuffle.The referee had to intervene and security officials prevented the situation from worsening further in front of the nearly 20,000 crowd at the Indira Gandhi Stadium. \nIn the 77th minute, NorthEast United’s Sabrosa and Chennaiyin’s Mehrajuddin Wadoo got involved in a face-off and both were shown the yellow cards. \nIn the first half, NorthEast got ample chances but failed to convert them into goals. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:44:05.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
