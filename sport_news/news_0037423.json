Cox, Getty Images) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE While admitting that it's a \"serious reach\" to compile an NFL mock draft just four games into the season, Eric Edholm of Yahoo Sports has done just that.\nUsing Yahoo's power rankings to determine the order, Edholm predicts that the Lions will select Mississippi defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche with the No. 8 pick in the first round.\nNkemdiche is projected to be a very high first-rounder, and the Lions undoubtedly would be thrilled to get Nkemdiche, especially in light of their injury concerns along the defensive front already this season. They might have to select sooner than eighth to have a shot at Nkemdiche.\nDETROIT NEWS\nLions' Stafford has 'played better' than stats might show\nEdholm also has Michigan State quarterback Connor Cook going sixth to the Texans and Spartans offensive tackle Jack Conklin No. 18 to the Chiefs.\nEdholm on Cook and the Texans: \"Bill O'Brien has the worst quarterback situation in the NFL right now, and that's saying something. ... Neither Ryan Mallett nor Brian Hoyer nor Tom Savage represent the future at all, and Cook — despite his accuracy concerns and some questions if he's a true leader of men (why is he not a team captain for the Spartans?) — has enough tools for the demanding O'Brien to work with.\"\nA notable omission from the first round is MSU star defensive end Shilique Calhoun.\nEdholm's No. 1? Notre Dame offensive Ronnie Stanley, to the Jaguars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:14:30.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
