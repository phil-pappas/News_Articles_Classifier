In some moments, he was even extraodinary.\nJacob deGrom just happened to pitch better.\nAnd so the Dodgers were defeated in their home stadium by the New York Mets, 3-1, and are now behind in their best-of-five National League division series, one game to zero.\nKershaw still has only one victory in nine career postseason starts, but the latest of his six losses was more of a reflection of deGrom than it was of him.\n\"I got outpitched,\" Kershaw said. \"That's basically the moral of the story. Jacob pitched an amazing game.\"\nKershaw was charged with three runs. DeGrom allowed none.\nKershaw pitched 6 2/3 innings. DeGrom pitched seven.\nKershaw struck out 11 batters. Armed with an electric fastball that was frequently clocked at 97 mph or higher, DeGrom struck out 13, matching a franchise postseason record set by Tom Seaver against the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the 1973 NL Championship Series.\n\"Obviously, a lot of velocity,\" Manager Don Mattingly said. \"It just seemed like he beat us with that a lot.\"\nNever before in baseball history had two pitchers struck out 11 or more batters in the same playoff game. The only other time two pitchers struck out 10 or more in the same game was in Game 5 of the 1944 World Series, when Mort Cooper of the St. Louis Cardinals struck out 12 and Denny Galehouse of the St. Louis Browns sturck out 10.\nThe Dodgers couldn't score until deGrom was out of the game. With setup man Tyler Clippard on the mound for the Mets in the eighth inning, Adrian Gonzalez hit an opposite-field single to drive in Howie Kendrick.\nBy then, the visitors had already scored three runs, building what felt like an insurmountable advantage.\nDaniel Murphy stunned the capacity crowd into silence by launching the first pitch of the fourth inning into the visiting bullpen in right field. The home run by the left-handed-hitting Murphy provided the Mets with a 1-0 edge.\nThe game opened up in the seventh inning.\nWith two outs, Kershaw walked his third batter of the inning, Curtis Granderson. The bases loaded and Kershaw's pitch count at 113, Mattingly removed the ball from his ace's hand.\nPedro Baez was called on to pitch to David Wright.\nAs Kershaw watched from the Dodgers bench, Wright lined a single into center field, driving in two runs and extending the Mets' lead to 3-0.\nThe game was essentially over.\nThe Dodgers had only seven hits, including five against deGrom.\n\"We had some chances,\" Mattingly said. \"We just weren't able to get that hit early.\"\nIn the early innings, the Dodgers only chances were created by Michael Cuddyer, the left fielder for the Mets.\nCuddyer misplayed a line drive by Justin Turner in the third second inning, allowing it to go over his head and off of his glove for a leadoff double.\nDeGrom struck out the next two batters, Andre Ethier and A.J. Ellis. DeGrom intentionally walked Joc Pederson, then struck out Kershaw to end the threat.\nCuddyer misplayed another ball in the third inning, resulting in another double. This time, Cuddyer allowed a high fly ball by rookie Corey Seager to drop inside of the foul line and bounce into the stands for a ground-rule double.\nGonzalez stepped into the batter's box.\nGonzalez, who struck out with Howie Kendrick on first base to end the first inning, struck out again.\nGonzalez played the final weeks of the regular season with a pinched nerve in his lower back that he said weakened his left leg.\nLeading up to Friday, Gonzalez said he was confident the problems were behind him.\n\"It should be 100 percent,\" Gonzalez said. \"I don't think it's going to be an issue at all. If I don't get a hit, it's not because of my back.\"\nBut how he could know?\n\"It's not something you completely feel in a one-hour practice,\" he acknowledged earlier in the week.\nThe Dodgers had a runner in scoring position again in the fourth inning, when Turner and catcher A.J. Ellis singled.\nFor Ellis, the single lengthened his postseason hitting streak to 11 games, equaling a franchise record established over the previous two seasons by Carl Crawford. However, the record-tying single didn't result in any runs, as deGrom retired Pederson and Kershaw to end the inning.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735469&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735469&h=DeGrom+outpitches+Kershaw+as+Mets+top+Dodgers%2C+3%2D1", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735469"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:25:38.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
