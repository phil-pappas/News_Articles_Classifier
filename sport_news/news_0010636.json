(Photo: USA TODAY Sports Images, for USA TODAY)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEW WAVERLY, Texas — Laurie Hernandez is the reigning U.S. junior gymnastics champion, and she’s won every meet she’s been at over the last two years.\nYet when the U.S. team for the world championships is picked Thursday, Hernandez won’t even be up for consideration. At 15, she’s too young, missing the cutoff to compete at this year’s worlds by five months and 21 days.\n“Obviously I would love to go to worlds,” Hernandez said before last month's national team training camp at Martha Karolyi’s ranch. “But I’m not old enough.”\nEvery Olympic cycle, there’s a gymnast who finds herself on the wrong side of the age divide. She can have the talent, poise and confidence to compete against the world’s best but, unless she meets the age requirement, none of that matters.\nNastia Liukin missed out on the 2004 Olympics because she was too young. Four years later, she won the all-around gold in Beijing. Kyla Ross couldn’t compete at the 2011 world championships, where the U.S. served notice it was the team to beat in London. A year later, Ross was part of the Fierce Five that won gold, only the second Olympic title for the American women.\nAs the Americans prepare for this year’s world championships, which serve as the main qualifier for next summer’s Rio Olympics, it’s not just Hernandez on the outside looking in. Her best friend and training partner, Jazmyn Foberg, is also good enough, just not old enough.\n“I’ve gone back and forth, do I wish they were age-eligible to go and have the experience? Or is it better to slow down and pace them?” said Maggie Haney, Hernandez and Foberg’s coach. “I think it’s good because it’s not too much right now. They are still only just 15. They’re going to get more international experience and gain some confidence and everything, so I think it’s fine.\n“Kyla wasn’t a senior until 2012, and look where she ended up.”\nJazmyn Foberg (Photo: Marc Lebryk, USA TODAY Sports)\nThe minimum age has long been a source of debate in gymnastics. Citing the growing physical and mental demands on young female gymnasts, the International Gymnastics Federation in 1981 raised the minimum age for competing at worlds or the Olympics to 15; it had been 14.\nThe age limit was raised again, to 16, in 1997. But there was an exception: If a gymnast would be old enough to compete at an Olympics, she could compete as a senior the year before in order to get more experience. When Shawn Johnson won the world title in 2007, for example, she was four months shy of her 16th birthday.\nBut that loophole was closed after the 2008 Olympics, which is why Ross wasn’t part of the 2011 world team.\n“I really was sad I wasn’t able to compete at world championships and be able to help the team there,” Ross said. “I was in the gym a lot and kept to myself. When the Olympic year came, I (tried) not to get sucked into all of the pressure.”\nWhile getting experience at big meets and face time with the judges is important, so, too is adjusting to elevated expectations. When someone has been so successful at the junior level, as Liukin and Ross were and Hernandez and Foberg are now, there’s a lot of anticipation to see if they can duplicate that at the senior level.\nThat’s another reason Karolyi brings the national team in for monthly training camps. Hernandez and Foberg may not be able to compete against the top Russians, Romanians and Chinese later this month, but they are regularly testing themselves against two-time world champion Simone Biles, reigning Olympic champion Gabby Douglas and Aly Raisman, also a double gold medalist in London.\n“We have those monthly verifications and we take it just as seriously as other competitions,\" Karolyi said. \"Through the years, we’ve proved that some of the young girls who had minimum international experience, they were able to function extremely well.”\nAfter last month’s training camp, Karolyi sent Hernandez and Foberg to an international junior meet in Japan. They came home with eight medals, including golds for Hernandez in the all-around, vault and floor exercise.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT ", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/873df0b998183e40d995d52e441c08669f60f32f/c=276-336-2114-2787&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798381852160957-XXX-Karolyi-7356.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b07b04fd8cbcc4c8edb1d79ae222a96e0c5cd33/r=342x400/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798381852160957-XXX-Karolyi-7356.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RupmQ7&text=U.S.%20junior%20champ%20Laurie%20Hernandez%20too%20young%20for%20world%20gymnastics%20championships&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798381852160957-XXX-Karolyi-7356.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RupmQ7&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6709af91cda3ae385d088e233ccc3bf607534b14/c=150-133-1882-2442&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798387104436293-USP-Gymnastics-P-G-Gymnastics-Championships.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:40:17.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
