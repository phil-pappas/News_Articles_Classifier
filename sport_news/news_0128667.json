He broke Ramos Vinolas again at 5-4 in the final set. \nFerrer next plays Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain, who beat Santiago Giraldo of Colombia 6-4, 6-3. \nAnother seeded player, Dominic Thiem, did lose in the opening round. Jerzy Janowicz of Poland came back from a disappointing first set to defeat the fifth-seeded Austrian 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4. \nEarlier, Gael Monfils made a winning return from a seven-week injury layoff Tuesday, rallying to beat Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4. \nThe 21st-ranked Frenchman played his first match since lower back problems forced him to pull out of the opening round at the U.S. Open. \nMonfils, who is seeded sixth, lost the opening set from 5-3 up but used one break in both the following sets to wrap up the victory. \nMonfils next plays Paolo Lorenzi of Italy, who advanced after rallying to defeat Rajeev Ram of the United States 6-7 (4), 6-1, 6-4. Ram hit 16 aces but lost his serve four times. \nAlso, John Isner relied on his strong serve to beat French qualifier Kenny De Schepper 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5). \nThe third-seeded American hit 16 aces and avoided break points, but failed to convert four chances on De Schepper's serve. Isner missed a match point at 6-5 but closed out the win on his second chance in the tiebreaker. \nThe 13th-ranked Isner will next play Ernests Gulbis of Latvia. \nSteve Johnson became the third American player to hit 16 aces Tuesday as he defeated Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, and Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine advanced by beating German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4, 6-4. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:14:59.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
