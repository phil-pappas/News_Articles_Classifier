Earlier, Liverpool had sacked Rodgers following their poor Premier League performances that put the five-time European champions in tenth place. Werner said that they have elected Rodgers hoping that he would prove to be a great manager for his club, the Mirror reported. Following Rodgers' dismissal, former Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp was appointed as the new Liverpool manager and also became the Anfield Club's highest paid manager after he signed a three-year contract worth five million pounds a year. Reflecting his views on their new manager, Werner said that that his club has now got the 'world-class' manager, adding he has the required quality to motivate the players. The club have secured only three wins from eight games that they have played in the ongoing Premier League campaign under Rodgers. Rodgers joined as Liverpool FC's manager in 2012 after serving with Swansea City for two years.(ANI)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:34:39.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
