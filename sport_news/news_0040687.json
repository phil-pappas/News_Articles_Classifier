For the umpteenth time.\nSuch is the nomadic life of an NFL coach in a world where job security is as guaranteed as those $1 million purses the DraftKings and FanDuel advertisements promise.\nThe latest stop for Eric Mangini is a visit Sunday night to the Meadowlands, where he roamed the sidelines as the Jets’ head coach from 2006-08 and where he became a small part of pop culture with an appearance on “The Sopranos,’’ on which Tony Soprano called him “Mangenius.’’\nMangini returns to New Jersey on Sunday night as the first-year defensive coordinator for the 49ers (1-3), who play the Giants (2-2) at MetLife Stadium.\n“I haven’t had many moments to reminisce about that type of stuff, but I loved New York,’’ Mangini told The Post. “I loved my experience there. It wasn’t always perfect, but it’s a great place.’’\nMangini was fired after the 2008 season when the Jets went 9-7 following an 8-3 start. He was force-fed Brett Favre at the start of that season with Jets owner Woody Johnson desperately trying to sell PSLs for the new stadium in which Mangini never got to coach.\nMangini was promised by Johnson that, regardless of the team’s record that year with Favre, his job was not in jeopardy. But nothing in life is guaranteed, and certainly not from the Jets owner’s office, where some major decisions have been made with the haste of an anxious teenager.\nIt has been a whirlwind decade for Mangini, who was a whiz-kid defensive coordinator at age 34 in New England, a first-time head coach at 35 with the Jets and fired from his second head-coaching job at 39 by the Browns.\nIn between Cleveland and San Francisco, Mangini — perceived in some circles as difficult with the media — worked as a TV analyst for ESPN.\n“If you can get out of what you’re real comfortable doing, then you’ve got a real chance for growth,’’ Mangini said.\nJim Harbaugh, who Mangini met for the first time while visiting his fellow coach Brad Seely when the 49ers were working in Ohio on an East Coast trip, opened the door for Mangini’s latest growth in coaching.\n“He called me out of the blue when I was at ESPN driving home one night and said, ‘Hey, do you want to come take a look at the team, spend some time out here,’ ’’ Mangini said.\nMangini worked as a 49ers offensive consultant for Harbaugh in 2013 and was his tight ends coach last season. When Harbaugh fled the 49ers for Michigan after last season and Jim Tomsula was elevated to head coach, Mangini was hired as defensive coordinator.\n“When this opportunity came up, I thought, ‘All right, this is the next step,’ ’’ he said.\nMangini initially took over a rather formidable defensive roster … and then the mass exodus began.\nDefensive end Justin Smith and linebackers Patrick Willis and Chris Borland retired suddenly. The team’s best pass rusher, Aldon Smith, was released after his fifth arrest since 2012. Starting cornerbacks Chris Culliver and Perrish Cox and starting linebacker Dan Skuda left via free agency.\n“I was going to lock my door and not let [Tomsula] come in any more [with bad news],’’ Mangini said. “There was a two-week span there where I didn’t want to let anyone in my office.’’\nHe said he “misses’’ being a head coach.\n“But,’’ he added, “there are some things that come up during the course of the week where you’re like, ‘Oh my God, I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with that.’ It’s the same thing when you’re coaching a position and you think, ‘OK, it’s the coordinator’s headache now.’ ’’\nMangini would welcome the head-coaching headaches again. He knows he’ll be better than he was the first two times because “there are a ton of great things I’ve learned seeing guys like Jim [Harbaugh] and how he did it, and seeing Jim Tomsula and how he’s doing it and from my background with [Bill] Parcells, [Bill] Belichick and one year with [Ted] Marchibroda.’’\nIf Mangini does land another head coaching job, this is the first thing he will have learned: Rent, don’t buy.\n“I still have a house in New Jersey in case you’re looking to buy one,’’ he said. “I also have one in Ohio and I’ve got one in Cape Cod. I’m collecting houses. I’ve got the ones in New Jersey and Ohio rented out, which is good, but I didn’t set out to be a landlord. But this profession kind of makes you one.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under new york giants ,  new york jets ,  san francisco 49ers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:48:00.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
