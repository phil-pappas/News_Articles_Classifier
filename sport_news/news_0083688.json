The 'Dogs fell to 18-5 and 4-1, respectively, but not until after a gritty effort that resulted in a breathtaking and tense nearly two-hour marathon on the hardwood at Hagerstown High School. \n\"I told my kids I need your best,\" said Hagerstown head coach Brian Dale of what he told his charges heading into the fifth and deciding game, with Centerville holding all the momentum. \nAimee Hoodlebrink had 19 kills and Savannah Houck added 12 for the Tigers, while Hannah Rogers set for 39 assists, Victoria Pierson led with 26 digs and Brytni Dale added 22. \nIt didn't appear it would turn into such a marathon. \nAfter pulling out the second game, then jumping ahead 11-2 in the third game, Hagerstown looked ready to wrap up the school's first TEC title in more than two decades. \nThe visitors from Centerville had other ideas. \n\"I've never been more proud of a team than this one tonight,\" said Centerville head coach Victoria Bevins. \"The result is not what we wanted, but the heart and how hard they played was incredible. We will walk out of here with our heads held high.\" \nEmily Jones had 52 digs for Centerville while Lanie McClanahan had 34. Lizzy Walther had 42 assists and 20 digs while Alexis Toschlog had 18 kills and four ace serves. \nThe 'Dogs actually scored 100 points themselves, and still couldn't overcome the Tigers. \nBrytni Dale had a string of six straight service points to open up the fifth game lead, then HHS held on for its historic win on senior night. \n\"I am very proud of this team, and of our five seniors, which are a great group of kids and players,\" Brian Dale said. \n\"Now we regroup for next week and finishing the regular season.\" \nHagerstown goes to Knightstown for a nonconference match on Tuesday, then can win the title outright next Thursday night with a win at Winchester. Centerville plays at Union City Monday and Union County Wednesday. \nCenterville battled hard in dropping its first TEC match of the season. Centerville and Union County are still mathematically alive for a share of the conference if Winchester can beat Hagerstown. \nIt was senior night Thursday at Hagerstown, with Morgan Masters, Ryley Murray, Houck, Hailee Garrison and Kendell Combs recognized as senior players. Combs was out with a season-ending injury. \nCenterville won the junior varsity match by identical game scores of 25-17, 25-17. \nThe seniors from Centerville played a part in the Bulldog comeback, even more than their play on the court. \n\"I asked the girls to write the name of a person or persons on their arms before the match, as a motivation, someone they wanted to play hard for tonight,\" Bevins said. \"Many of our girls wrote the names of our four seniors on their arms, and I reminded them of that during the timeout when we were behind 11-2 in that third game. I guess that worked.\" \nCenterville seniors playing in the match were Monica Herrman, Toschlog, Jones and Kaylin Smith. \nThe result was an instant Wayne County volleyball classic. 230 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1LkZhSy TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:04:50.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
