Izzie Marsico knocked down five kills, Kira Vitella made eight digs and Abby E'Nama had four kills. Maddy Holt and Alison Palmer each scored three kills. \nPayton Heck came off the bench to power in four aces while Mallory Jones made four assists. \n\"I wasn't thrilled with our first set performance where we gave them half their points on our errors,\" said head coach Tyler Coupe. \"In the second and third sets, we responded well.\" \nThe whole team was a part of the victory for the Vikings. \n\"I was happy to see both Payton Heck and Maddy Holt get into a rhythm behind the service line and for sophomore Mallory Jones to run offense the third set,\" Coupe said. \n\"We lacked focus in the first set,\" said senior libero Kira Vitella. \"We were really sloppy, but came together in the second and third sets to play the way we know how to play.\" \nEmily Truitt and Chrishlyn Wisniewski led the Golden Knights with seven kills and eight assists, respectively. Sussex Central moved to 2-6 on the season. \nThe Vikings will host the Bucs of Milford Tuesday, Oct.13.
