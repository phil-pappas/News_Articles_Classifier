(Photo: MICHAEL ROLANDS/RECORD-HERALD) Story Highlights Planning for playoff and district changes is underway for Iowa's 2016 prep football season IHSAA Board of Control approved 48 teams to Class 4A, bumping up large 3A schools next season Proposals include seven districts in each class, 'wild card' playoff spot CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThree weeks remain in Iowa high school football's 2015 regular season, yet major changes meant for 2016 are already having an effect. \nThe 32-team playoff fields were already cut in half. Now, the enrollment floor for Class 4A has been removed and the eight-district format could go with it. \nThe Iowa High School Athletic Association is working its way across the state at five scheduled district athletic director meetings this week and next, focused on fixing up district football and playoff qualification next season. \n\"This isn't a 100-year solution,\" IHSAA assistant executive director Todd Tharp told the Register. \n\"We took 32 qualifiers and that lasted for eight years. For 2016, we had to look at options. Every two-year cycle, we're going to have look at evaluating what's best for football down the line.\" \nReaction was mixed in June when the announcement came to ax 96 playoff teams — the IHSAA opted for fewer qualifiers instead of starting the regular season earlier or shortening the season — and the system is still being built up around it. District decisions won't be made until December, but it's a tough talking point right now. \n\"I don't really have a preference. We really don't here,\" Tharp said. \"We certainly got tired of answering questions from frustrated parents and coaches when we went to 16 and why there was an 8-1 team not making the postseason and why a team that was 6-3 was. That was part of the expansion process and now we've had to reduce back.\" \nClass 4A clears enrollment mark \nThe final numbers aren't in, but Norwalk coach Paul Patterson knows what's next. \nTo even out Class 4A like its small-school counterparts with an easily divisible number of teams, the IHSAA Board of Control voted in September to eliminate the necessary enrollment number of 700 and instead approve the top 48 schools to be in the classification. \n\"We would have tried to schedule 4A non-district opponents, but we knew we weren't going to be at 700, so there was no reason to do that,\" Patterson said. \n\"We're going to hear, 'Well, Norwalk is already twice as big as some of the schools they play.' Twice as big for us means that we're 300 kids bigger. Twice as big for us means they're 600 kids bigger. Depth is an issue. Talent is an issue. \n\"They know there's a discrepancy in enrollment. They're not addressing it, and in fact they're making it worse.\" \nThis season, 46 teams are playing 4A football; Western Dubuque (654 enrollment for 2014-15, grades 9-11) and Norwalk (633) are in line to take a giant step up. Other central Iowa options — Newton (616), Boone (559) and Dallas Center-Grimes (558) — might not be far behind when next year's numbers come in. \n\"We know that at some point in time, Dallas Center-Grimes is going to play 4A football,\" DCG coach and Iowa Football Coaches Association president Scott Heitland said. \n\"Up until last month, we have been trying to project when our first classes that will break 700 were going to come along. We thought we were six, eight, maybe even 10 years away from that. \n\"We wanted to make sure we were preparing for it the right way. With the news of 700 dropping, I think we're on more of a two-to-four-year plan.\" \nThe decision to put 48 teams in 4A means the next 56 schools by enrollment will be distributed to 3A, 2A and 1A. The remaining schools will fall to Class A and eight-player football. \n\"We'll bring our classification committee in a year from now to start looking at things,\" Tharp said. \n\"They'll have preliminary enrollment numbers to look at to see the trends that are happening and make decisions. Maybe 48 in 4A won't be the number. Maybe it'll be 40 or 42 or 54, we'll look and decide.\" \nThe change will impact a small number of programs — fringe 3A teams stepping up to 4A and the few resulting dominoes — but Patterson feels like the move is huge for the Warriors. They're likely trading Pella (520) and Carlisle (461) for teams like Valley (2,196) and Dowling Catholic (1,090) in one off-season. \n\"Football is a physically violent sport and now you are putting us at a competitive disadvantage, knowingly, just because you've got to have 48,\" Patterson said. \"Yeah, we have to play 4A come playoff time in baseball, basketball and track, but those kids aren't coming to hit you.\" \nChanging the district count \nGetting 32 playoff teams out of eight districts was easy. The top four teams in each district qualified every fall since the field expanded in 2008, even if 4A was slow to adopt. \nCutting that back to 16 teams, which the entire state embraced in 1986, gives coaches trepidation about qualifying and avoiding the dreaded three-way tie. \n\"One thing the IFCA feels very strongly about is that if you're a district champion, you deserve to be in the postseason,\" Heitland said. \"Whether that's as an outright champion, in a tie or in a three-way tie. It was really hard over the years to see an 8-1 team in a three-way tie get left at home.\" \nAn IHSAA proposal to avoid those old pitfalls involves altering the amount of districts in each classification. By potentially putting six districts in 4A and seven districts in the smaller classes, the system could support playoff flexibility. \n\"The district champion and district runner-up would qualify and then the two remaining schools,\" Tharp said. \nSeven districts of eight teams in 3A, 2A and 1A would likely mean seven district games in the nine-game schedule. It adds importance and playoff assembly, even if the classes are not absolutely required to abide by the exact same policies. \n\"There's discussion out there that some coaches do not like to play a non-district game in the middle of their season and that's why they'd like to see maybe seven districts of eight,\" Tharp said. \n\"But if 3A wanted to be seven districts of eight but 2A wanted to stay eight districts of seven, it would probably cause a little bit of chaos.\" \nBut that doesn't mean cutting one or two districts in each class comes without a cost. The concept is under deliberation at the athletic director meetings. \n\"If I eliminate a district, my mileage is going to increase,\" Tharp said. \"We've shared with athletic directors, this is what your current map looks like with eight districts of seven, then on the backside of that, this is what we think seven districts of eight would look like.\" \nRedrawing districts for next season is a sure thing. How many districts there are to draw from is still up in the air. \nPlayoff 'wild card' \nSo, how would 16 playoff teams come out of six or seven districts next season? The idea welcomes in a \"wild card\" spot. \nThe IHSAA hypothetical district trim would mean two qualifiers out of each district (just like old times) and room in the playoffs for teams that are part of a three-way tie or have finished with a strong record and resume. \n\"The huge elephant in the room is how to decide those two additional qualifying teams, 15th and 16th, how to get them in,\" Tharp said. \n\"If we didn't have a tie, then we'd have to create some type of criteria to determine how those teams get in.\" \nIt's an idea brought up by the IFCA in the summer and being used as a selling point at discussions this week. \n\"We tossed out the idea of seven districts so that it would create 14 automatic qualifiers and a couple at-large spots,\" Heitland said. \nJust how the IHSAA would fill those additional spots in the absence of three-way ties or similar records is speculative. But it still means there's lots to talk about for 2016. \n\"We're very comfortable, at least for 2016-17, that we'll have five classes of 11-player and one class of eight-player,\" Tharp said. \"And then once the time comes, we'll reevaluate.\" \nThe 2015 postseason begins Wednesday, Oct. 28.
