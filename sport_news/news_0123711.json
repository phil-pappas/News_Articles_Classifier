In fact, already some political leaders have mocked at Badal being bracketed with Mandela. However, what Prime Minister Narendra Modi should recognise is the fact that at this moment in history, India really needs a Nelson Mandela — an anti-apartheid revolutionary and a champion of social justice and human rights. A Nelson Mandela is indeed needed because some unhealthy groups have now become hyperactive in the country. These groups are challenging civil liberties such as freedom of thought, freedom of ideas and the freedom to their way of life and to eat whatever one wants to. To fight such forces, the country needs a determined and noble soul like Mandela, who spent 27 years in jail fighting against the oppression by the white minority of the black South-Africans. Can Badal can rise to this expectation? This is a big, but pertinent, question. It is a fact that Badal was imprisoned number of times. He remained behind bars for a long period during the Emergency, when all civil liberties were revoked and freedom of speech and protest was done away with. Besides, he spent time in jail from time to time in connection with the Morcha launched by the Akalis for the implementation of the demands stated in the Anandpur Sahib Resolution. However, equally deafening is the silence of Badal over the targeting of people of a particular community in Uttar Pradesh and other places. No one is aware of what stand Badal and his party — the SAD, which claims to be sole representative of one of the most vibrant minority — has taken over the killing of Akhlaq in Bisara just on the basis of a suspicion. Neither does one know what stand the SAD has taken over the killing of certain writers such as Prof MM Kalburgi. There are forces which are openly challenging the pluralistic character of the country and trying hard to enforce their ideology in every sphere of life, including education, culture and research. So many provocative statements have been given by certain MPs of the ruling party against the members of a particular community in recent months. There has been no perceptible reaction from Badal and his party in this regard. The Akali Dal is a product of the great legacy of Sikh leaders who fought against oppression, injustice and tyranny. However, the silence of the SAD now on these very issues is not only surprising but also baffling. There are visible challenges to the liberal character of Indian democracy from forces operating freely without any fear of law but the SAD is yet to take a stand against this emerging phenomenon. The mettle of a politician and a political party is tested in testing times. What stand a politician takes and how his party confronts a particular situation (such as one emerging in the country now) differentiates him and his organisation from others. The SAD should have been in the forefront to confront forces challenging the country’s liberal, democratic ethos. It should have been the most vocal critic of such forces. Even on the issue of India-Pakistan relations, the SAD has remained, by and large, silent. Tension on the India-Pak border affects Punjab the most. One of the reasons for industry not coming to Punjab is the persisting tension on the border. Badal, keeping in view his experience and standing in Indian politics, should have played an active role to bat for peace between the two countries. There has been no active effort on his part in this regard. The other day, the Shiv Sena threatened to disrupt eminent Pakistan singer Ghulam Ali's concert at Mumbai. Apprehending violence, the organisers cancelled the concert after a meeting with the Shiv Sena President. The Shiv Sena had stated that no artiste from Pakistan would be allowed to perform in Mumbai until the terror attacks from that country do not stop. Ghulam Ali was to perform in the memory of iconic Punjabi ghazal singer, the late Jagjit Singh. Immediately, taking the initiative, Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, invited Ghulam Ali to perform in Delhi and assured him all the assistance. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Akhilesh Yadav, personally received Ghulam Ali in Lucknow, where he held his concert. Why was such an initiative not taken by Badal and his government? Ghulam Ali is a household name in Punjab. He is a Punjabi who lives in Lahore. Obviously, Badal and his party do not want to antagonise the Shiv Sena. Of course, Badal is an ally of the BJP at the state level and at the national level. He is part of the NDA, of which the Shiv Sena too is a partner. But the SAD has its line of thinking and a political legacy. It draws inspiration from a philosophy that exhorts human rights, social justice and a society free from any discrimination on the basis of caste and religion. Moreover, it represents one of the most visible minorities in the country. Whenever any issue related to any minority comes up in the public domain, it is expected that the SAD leadership would take a clear stand. Many eminent men of letters have taken a stand against the attack on the freedom of thought and ideology. They have returned their Sahitya Akademi awards. Badal and his party are, however, silent. Mandela once said: “To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity”. At another place, he said: “I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.” Mandela fought against racial discrimination and apartheid. His bravery in the fight against apartheid was matchless. Because of this reason, he became the undisputed champion of human rights. In our country, social practices like casteism, much worse then racial discrimination, still persist. Human beings are insulted, humiliated and denigrated in the name of caste. Everyone would like to see Badal becoming the Nelson Mandela of India. He can be so if he spends the rest of his life in fighting the menace of casteism, discrimination in the name of religion, for human rights of oppressed classes and for social justice of the down trodden. India needs a Nelson Mandela to uphold civil liberties, freedom of thought, and freedom to way of life. A Mandela is required to fight the forces which are spreading hatred. There is a lot to do to free this country from so many social vices. Badal has his job cut out for him if he wants to be rechristened as Nelson Mandela. sarbjit.dhaliwal@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:08:58.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
