Just looking to go in there and help contribute as much as possible.\"\nRandle ran for 85 yards on his first three carries Sunday afternoon. But he picked up only two yards on his next 11 carries, losing yards on three of his four carries in the second half.\nIt's premature to say Michael will be active for Sunday night's game against New Orleans. But his elevation this week suggests the club is considering an alteration of its current committee structure at running back, with Randle getting most of the carries followed by Darren McFadden.\nLance Dunbar's role as the primary receiving threat out of the backfield is clearly safe.\nThe Cowboys traded for Michael because they consider him to be a physical, north/south runner, something of a DeMarco Murray light.\n\"I think he might be a guy that can be utilized when you're going against some of those big boy, hard boxes,\" offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said.\nMichael said he doesn't know if he'll be part of the rotation this weekend. He said the priority is to bounce back from the loss to the Falcons.\n\"You've got guys like Lance Dunbar,\" Michael said. \"He's real active in the passing game. You've got guys like Joe Randle, who's good at catching the ball, running it between the tackles. He's pretty much good at everything. Guys like Darren McFadden, who's the big brother out of the group.\n\"This is a good group of running backs. We're all young. It's just fun to be a part of it, man.\"\nBriefly\nCornerback Brandon Carr, who was excused from Wednesday's practice for personal reasons, was a full participant Thursday.\nCatch David Moore on The Ticket (KTCK-AM 1310 and 96.7 FM) with The Musers at 9:35 a.m. every Monday and Friday and The Hardline at 4:10 p.m. every Tuesday and Friday during the season.\nMORE MUST-READ COWBOYS Is Brandon Weeden the answer at QB?\nCowboys VP: Brandon Weeden needs to step up, missed opportunities in Atlanta game\nMoore: The truth about Cowboys QB Brandon Weeden's ability to throw\nCowlishaw: Cowboys must test Brandon Weeden soon, because Patriots sure will\n10 things to know about Cowboys QB Brandon Weeden, including the first impression he made on Dez Bryant\nDo the Dallas Cowboys have a quarterback controversy?
