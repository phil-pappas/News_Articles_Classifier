Our freshmen are inexperienced, yet very talented,” Barnes said. “Nikki and Indiya both broke the freshman record for 3-point field goals made last year and we’d love for that to happen again this year. Any freshman that steps up will be an added bonus. Our expectations are that they play and contribute.” \nLost to graduation are Heidi Schlegel (18.3 points, 9.4 rebounds) and Tish Walker (10.4 points, 7.4 rebounds) but according to Barnes, the cupboard is far from bare. \n“We lost our top two scorers and rebounders from a season ago in Heidi and Tish, however, I saw the players step up over the summer and this fall so the plan right now is to replace them by committee,” he said. “Nikki stepped up as a team leader while local product, Sarah Cash of Lordstown, also stepped up during the offseason as well. We’re just six practices into the season and I’d like to think that we’re on track. There’s still a long way to go so we tell the team just get better every day so once the season begins, we will be ready to go.” \nThis year’s roster configuration includes Benjamin and Melinda Trimmer at point guard, Jenna Hirsch, Alison Smolinski and Kelley Wright at the two-guard, Janae Jackson and Kelsea Newman at forward, Jill Blacksten and Morgan Olson at the four spot and Marissa Brown and Cash at the five slot. \n“It’s exciting because in past years, six or seven players got most of the minutes. This year, all 12 roster members could see significant playing time,” Barnes said. “We have to be tough mentally and outwork our opponents. We must play smart and consistent each time out.” \nLast year’s recruiting class was ranked in the top 25 percent nationally while academically, their 3.422 overall team grade point average ranked 22nd in the nation. \nBarnes said there are three important things he touches on every day at practice. \n“We preach mental toughness so when you come to practice mentally tough, that only leads to good practice sessions,” he said. “Staying in the moment and practicing with a sense of urgency is also key.” \nYSU’s schedule includes trips to Penn State, Akron and Bucknell. In addition to Horizon League opponents, the Penguins will host Kent State, Robert Morris and former Ohio Valley Conference foe, Tennessee State. \nNewman, who accompanied Barnes to the luncheon, said everything seems to be falling into place as they eye a scrimmage with Marshall University on Oct. 31, and then host Marietta in an exhibition contest Nov. 8. \n“We’re young, but there’s a chemistry that’s already developing,” Newman said. “Our schedule will be a challenge once again, especially in the league, but our work ethic is what will get us through those games.” \nNext week, former NBA and current college basketball official Joe DeRosa, a Lowellville native will serve as guest speaker.
