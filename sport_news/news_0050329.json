(AP) - Forty-three of the 50 Michigan hunters who were fortunate to get an elk license bagged a big animal during the late summer season. \nThe Department of Natural Resources says 15 bull elk and 28 antlerless elk were killed. \nHow popular is the elk hunt? The DNR says only 100 of 36,000 applicants were selected through a lottery. Dale Grelewicz of Twin Lakes in the Upper Peninsula got a bull elk with his wife at his side. He tells the DNR that he had applied for more than 20 years. \nFifty more hunters will get their chance at an elk during a nine-day hunt that starts Dec. 5. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:51:38.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
