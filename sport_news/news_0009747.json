To catch Belvidere North, the three-time defending conference champs, it will take all the Pretzels can muster. \"I don't know if we can catch Belvidere North, they're extremely tough again,\" Freeport coach Alan Greene said. \"But we'll give it a shot. We've got some girls coming back from injury, and we're running good right now, so we'll see what we've got.\" Led by a pair of freshmen, Gabby Rodriguez and Sophia Wilks, the Pretzels placed fourth at their own invite and 10th at the Sterling Invitational. And now that Cassidy Grunewald (foot) and Ana Rodriguez (achilles) are nearing full strength, they could be even better. \"We don't have the frontrunners like North and Hononegah, but we're hoping we can get a pack up there and do some damage,\" Greene said. \"We've been missing a runner or two a lot this year, so it will be nice to see what we can do with everybody out there.\" Sophomore Allie Kundert and junior Kyla Wilcox are also expected to run for Freeport, as is junior Cassie Hood. North, led by defending NIC-10 champ Jenna Lutzow, and a deep Boylan team led by Delaney Appino and Grace McLaughlin, are the favorites, but Freeport could easily finish as high as third â€” and maybe even higher if everything goes right. Freeport boys The Pretzels are looking to dig themselves out of last place in the boys NIC-10 standings this year, and they will look to junior Sam Wilks to help in a big way. Wilks has a top three-mile time of 16:40 which put him 19th at the Freeport invite, and Greene believes he could make it all the way to state in Class 2A, if he puts it all out there. \"Sam has come through lately, and he's running well,\" Greene said. \"We've done a lot of improving, and we want to see what it gets us.\" Nate Skarlupka has been sick lately, but he's expected back, and freshman Tate Slaght has improved enough to possibly make some noise in his first conference meet Saturday as well. The NIC-10 meet, held at Rockford University, will begin with the girls varsity race at 10:30 a.m. followed by the boys at 11:10 a.m. Jay Taft: 815-987-1384; jtaft@rrstar.com; @JayTaft", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:36:20.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
