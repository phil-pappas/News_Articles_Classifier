He rejoined the team at the stadium following the Beavers' 17-13 loss .\n\"He was in the locker room and he appears to be fine,\" Oregon State head coach Gary Andersen said. \"It's good for all of us to know he's back.\"\nDecoud remained motionless on the field for several minutes after a teammate's helmet collided with the right side of his head and neck. Medical staff removed his facemask, placed him on a backboard and loaded him into an ambulance as a silent crowd looked on.\nRedshirt freshman running back Ryan Nall said the team was informed at halftime that Decoud would be OK.\n\"That gave us a good reassurance,\" Nall said. \"When our brother goes down, it's hard. You've got to do everything you can to pull yourself together and just get back in the game.\"\n-- Danny Moran\ndmoran@oregonian.com\n@DannyJMoran", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DannyJMoran", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210251963&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://www.osubeavers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30800&SPID=127145&SPSID=750123&KEY="], "published": "2015-10-25T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:20:25.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
