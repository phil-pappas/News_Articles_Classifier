Comment Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 7:05 PM By Observer-Dispatch Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 7:05 PM New Hartford sophomore Sarah Corasanti will make her second straight appearance in the state tennis tournament. Corasanti made it to the championship match of the state qualifier Thursday at Drumlins Country Club in Syracuse. She came up short, losing 6-4, 6-2 to Baldwinsville's Kahlei Reisinger. Corasanti earned a spot in states by finishing in the top three. She defeated Maggie Bonomo of Fayetteville-Manlius 6-4, 6-3 in the semifinals. Corasanti lost in the first round of last year's state tournament in Latham. The state tournament will be back there this year and will take place next Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Oneida's doubles team of Jillian Brodock and Brianna Laureti just missed out on a spot in states. They lost in their semifinal match to West Genesee's Samantha Heyn and Mikayla Mannara 6-3, 6-4, and they lost the third-place match in three sets to F-M's Kristina Liu and Shirley Zhang 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
