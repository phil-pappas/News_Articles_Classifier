Uruguay and Fiji have already been evicted from the competition, their chances of advancement already crushed, they join England in the process of going through the motions of completing their programme. And today they play the match of the living dead. \n\"It's just the luck of the draw, isn't it?\" the Fiji coach John McKee said ahead of Tuesday afternoon’s encounter at Stadium MK. \"Looking at the teams we came up against and looking at the other pools, hypothetically we may have had a pathway to the quarter-finals, or at least an easier pathway.\" \nDespite already being eliminated, this Rugby World Cup Fiji have enjoyed more success in the scrum, completed more passes per game and won more turnovers than England. But then Uruguay have won more turnovers than England. And for both teams, this game represents the opportunity to gain ranking points in the process of seeking qualification for the next World Cup in Japan in 2019. \nFiji are strong favourites to beat Uruguay \nFor the Uruguay coach Pablo Lemoine, moreover, there is further incentive. He scored the country’s last Rugby World Cup try, against England in 2003; his ambition is to now coach his side to score another. \n\"I had never seen the try until one month ago on Independence Day when World Rugby showed it. It was really exciting for me to remember,” said Lemoine of his consolation score in a rout in which Clive Woodward’s side scored 17 tries. “I hope we score tomorrow. The greatest achievement is to score in the World Cup and it will be fantastic for the players.\" \nIt will not be easy for Uruguay, particularly as their opponents will be hugely bolstered by the return of their giant wing Nemani Nadolo, who was suspended from their game against Wales last Thursday in Cardiff. His re-appearance will give Lemoine a significantly increased challenge. \n\"For a team of our size, it's a lot of Nadolo in front of us,” the coach admitted. “He can appear from everywhere and is quite difficult. If we put a lot of energy on him then we have 14 other players [to deal with].\" \nThe Uruguayans back row forward Agustin Alonso, however, was more sanguine about the prospect of playing the Fijians for a third time this year, despite having been beaten in the previous two matches. \nUruguay have waited 12 years to score another World Cup try \n“They don’t have a game plan, it is a disorderly team,” he said of the islanders. Though he accepted that can have unforeseen consequences. \n“Playing against a disorderly team often means that you end up disorderly too.\" \nBut whatever the haphazard nature of the tie, for the one wholly amateur team in the competition , it can deliver an important marker in their development. Especially with a mooted pan-American Six Nations competition involving USA, Canada, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and the Uruguayans scheduled to start in 2016. \nThough even with that sort of annual competition in progress, the South Americans’ captain, Santiago Vilaseca, whose day job is in banking, was not hugely optimistic about how far rugby could go in a country in which football dominates. Asked when he thought Uruguay might boast a fully professional rugby system, he said, succinctly: \"When the cows fly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:06:46.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
