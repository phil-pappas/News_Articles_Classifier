GIANTS 30, 49ERS 27\nThey lost Odell Beckham Jr., until the very last minute of the game. They lost Rueben Randle.\nBut they were not losing this game.\nJust when you thought the Giants couldn’t get any more battered, they did. On Sunday night at MetLife Stadium, Big Blue lost its top two receivers to hamstring injuries, then it lost another lead, choking away a seven-point halftime edge against the San Francisco 49ers.\nYet with 21 seconds to play, with a hobbled Beckham back on the field and Big Blue facing a four-point deficit, there was Eli Manning, dropping back on first-and-10 from the Niner 12, looking to complete a miracle comeback. And somehow, he rifled a pass over the middle, to a tightly covered Larry Donnell, who managed to outleap two Niner defenders and cradle the ball, the winning touchdown in a wild 30-27 victory.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News Larry Donnell hauls in the game-winning touchdown between two defenders.

They’ve now won three straight games, erasing any bad memories from their season-opening two-game losing skid.\nManning and Beckham were the heroes in this one. It was Beckham who had been the early hero, making seven catches for 121 yards and one fantastic third-quarter TD that seemed to give the Giants control of the game, 20-13, late in the third quarter. But on that very same play, he’d injured his chronically troublesome hamstring, and he was forced to the sidelines for most of the final period, until the game’s very last drive.\nManning? All he’d done is pilot the Giants to two late scores, piling up 441 passing yards and three TDs. He completed 41 passes, breaking the club record set by Phil Simms on Oct. 13 1985.\nBut it all seemed for naught with 1:45 to play, whe Niner running back Carlos Hyde had capped a seven-play drive by plunging across the goal line on second-and-goal from the 2.\nThat had given the Niners a 27-23 edge, and it seemed to complete a stunning comeback spurred on by those Giants injuries. The Giants had dominated the first half, building a 13-6 edge and looking fluid and relaxed while doing it.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News Odell Beckham Jr. finishes with seven catches for 121 yards and a touchdown in the Giants' 30-27 victory. But things began to fall apart late in the third quarter when, with 1:17 to play, Beckham made what seemed like a spectacular play.\nHe’d bailed out Manning on first-and-10 from the Niner 17, when the quarterback flipped a tough pass to the receiver. Beckham seemed set to be tackled, but he gracefully planted and whirled toward the sideline, outracing everyone to the end zone to return the lead to Big Blue, 20-13.\nBut it was the last down that Beckham would play until the final minute. He’d injured his hamstring, and was left standing on the sidelines.\nMeanwhile, Kaepernick led the Niners back into the game. He’d spend the next 4:25 leading San Francisco 80 yards down field, and with 11:53 to play, he hit Garrett Celek for a five-yard score that tied the game, 20-20.\nThe Giants would regain the lead with 4:29 to play, on a 24-yard Josh Brown field goal. But that drive ended with another injury: Rueben Randle had also injured his hamstring and was done for the night.\nElsa/Getty Images Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie knocks the ball loose from Colin Kaepernick. And to think: throughout the first half, it had hardly seemed like Big Blue would need any heroics. Sure, the Niners struck first, opening the evening by driving 55 yards on eight plays for a 43-yard Phil Dawson field goal and a 3-0 lead. But the Giants offense had an explosive answer.\nAfter Manning gave running back Rashad Jennings four straight touches, on second-and-3 from his own 39, Beckham got behind the secondary. A less-than-perfect, short throw from Manning and a game-saving tackle by Kenneth Acker at the 10 held Beckham out of the end zone, but the big play still set up a game-tying 22-yard chip shot by Josh Brown.\nIt was the first of 13 straight Giants points. A drive later, four catches by Beckham - including a 31-yard grab over the middle - set up a two-yard TD reception by Shane Vereen. And a possession after that, Brown wrapped up another easy Giants drive with a 41-yard field goal for a 13-3 edge.\nBut San Francisco did just enough to stay in the game, even if the Giants repeatedly seemed primed to take control. On the Niners’ next possession, Kaepernick pushed San Fran down for a 22-yard Dawson chip shot with 1:05 left until halftime.\nThen Manning powered the Giants downfield again, completing five of his next six passes, driving Big Blue to the Niner 14. With 11 seconds to go, the Giants seemed guaranteed a field goal try before halftime. But Manning wrecked that opportunity, dropping back and forcing a throw to a well-covered Beckham, an easy interception for Tramaine Brock just before halftime.\nRelated Stories Giants award game ball to Daniel Fells Osi Umenyiora: Giants need Jason Pierre-Paul Giants LB Jon Beason ruled out for rest of game", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:18:11.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
