Although with the amount of snaps Cannon has played within the team’s rotational philosophy, he shouldn’t be labeled a backup. But playing the majority of the game as Tom Brady’s blind-side protection carries a lot more weight.\n“It’s always unfortunate when it happens to a teammate,” Cannon said of Solder’s injury. “I hope he gets well.”\nThat’s the usual response from any teammate when a player suffers an injury, but going into battle without Solder is almost uncharted territory. The tackle, who was injured in the first quarter against Dallas Sunday, has missed just four regular-season starts since being drafted in the first round in 2011.\nCannon has experience at both guard and tackle and, while that versatility is valuable, the fact that he can step in at left tackle for a long stretch is why that extension makes sense.\nHowever, Cannon did not feel like delving into whether the team’s show of confidence gave him any.\n“I’m past that,” he said.\nIf form holds, Cannon might not play every snap at left tackle against the Colts, but when he’s there, he will be tested mainly by outside linebackers Trent Cole, Robert Mathis or Erik Walden.\nCannon noted their strengths, along with the other players he might have to block if and when he’s kicked inside to guard.\n“Their outside linebackers are really good speed rushers,” he said. “They’ve got big, physical guys inside. They use their hands real good. It’s going to be a challenge.”\nIn a way, Cannon seemed nonplussed by the developments since Sunday. There was a bit of a casual tone to his answers, as if being seen as the next man up at such an important position was no big deal.\nSaid the 6-foot-5, 335-pounder when asked about how his year has been going, “It’s going how it’s going. I’m just trying to get ready for the Colts.”\nHo-hum, just another game, which is how it may be best for him to prepare, but this isn’t just another game. It’s a nationally televised, prime-time rematch with the organization that tipped off the league to allegedly deflated footballs used in the AFC title game that led to, among other penalties, the Patriots losing a 2016 first-round draft pick and nearly losing Brady to a four-game suspension handed down by the league.\nIt’s a big game, and Cannon has to be at his best if the Patriots want to exact any sort of revenge for what they all endured over the offseason.\nHe knows that, he just wasn’t about to get into it yesterday.\n“If they call on me, they call on me,” he said. “I’ll do my best to get the job done.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:46:22.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
