More than 1,200 Connecticut runners finished the marathon last year, down about 90 from 2013.\nBut one thing has stayed consistent: The average Connecticut runner in both of the last two years was 38.67 years old.\nWest Hartford's runners account for about 0.13 percent of its population, so people who didn't have the motivation to run last year are in good company. But that percentage is still one of the highest percentages in the state.\nAmong all towns that sent at least 10 runners to the Hartford Marathon last year, Middlebury sent the greatest percentage (0.16 percent) of its population.\nSOURCE: Hartford Marathon Foundation, CoolRunning.com Copyright Â© 2015, Hartford Courant", "external_links": ["https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617f3c3/turbine/hc-which-connecticut-town-sends-the-most-runners-to-the-hartford-marathon-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:01:43.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
