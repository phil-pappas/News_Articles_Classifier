Rosetta Sutton Oct. 13, 1913 — July 4, 2015 A Memorial Service celebrating the life of Rosetta Sutton will be held at First Presbyterian Church of the 49ers in Columbia, California at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015. Rosetta Sutton, 101 years old, was born on Oct. 13, 1913, in Champion, Nebraska to William and Neva Hauschel. Rosetta grew up with three sisters, Nellie, Maxine and Ruth, and a brother, Cliff. Rosetta moved to California in the 1940s. It was here she met and married her love, Walter Sutton, and adopted his two young sons Arthur and Clifford, then residing in San Jose. She enjoyed gardening, walking, canning, baking, cooking, painting, singing, dancing, card games and sewing. Walter and Rosetta enjoyed a hobby of collecting rocks and produced beautiful pieces they displayed in their home. Rosetta began painting at 70 years old. She enjoyed painting photographs that Walter had taken of mountain and desert scenery. They found themselves in good company of dear friends and family over the years. In their retirement, they built their home in Tuolumne County. There they could garden, picnic, and travel to visit family. They enjoyed their growing family of two sons, six grandchildren in California and Connecticut, and twelve great grandchildren in California, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Washington and one great-great-grandchild in South Carolina. Rosetta and Walter’s family have fond memories of homemade ice cream, canned fresh picked peaches, camping trips, rides through the mountains to Yosemite National Park, the Big Trees, a skunk, a rattlesnake, a mountain lion and many nights guessing the shapes of limestone rocks in the moonlight, Columbia State Historic Park with stage coach rides and panning for gold, stories of growing up on the Farm in Nebraska, and the enjoyment of finally reaching the height that we were taller than our little Grandma. This list could go on and on. Rosetta was predeceased in death by her granddaughter, Diana in 1981; her husband, Walter in 1989; and her youngest son, Clifford in 1999. Her family would like to thank the many wonderful people that graced her life since the passing of her husband including friends at Columbia Sky Mobile Home Park, The 49er Church of Columbia, Skyline Place Senior Living, Edwards Jones Sonora, Bank of Stockton, Umpqua Bank Columbia, H&R Block and her final years at Oak Terrace Memory Care. Thank you very much.
