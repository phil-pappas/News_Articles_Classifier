Our younger players did a great job subbing in and keeping up the pace with Emma Gerrish and Seanna Montgomery playing well in the midfield.” \n“The teams both battled very well and were locked in an even contest for the entire game,” said Schooner coach Matthew Smith. “Though CRMS had the majority of possession, Oceanside had some good counter attacks and nearly took the win at the end of regular time.” \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:33:32.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
