Dupuis was limited to 16 games during the 2014-15 season because of blood clots and missed the second half of the 2013-14 season with a knee injury.\nDupuis was expected to play on the third line with Nick Bonino and David Perron. Beau Bennett will likely move up to the third line when Pittsburgh plays at Dallas in the season opener on Thursday.\nDupuis was one of the most durable members of the Penguins until tearing the ACL in his right knee against Ottawa on Dec. 23, 2013. He was off to a solid start last fall with seven goals in 16 games before the clotting issue was discovered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:44:47.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
