By Jan Skutch A defense attorney’s appeal of a judge’s denial of a claim that prosecutors “goaded” him into seeking a mistrial for former Savannah-Chatham police Sgt. Malik Khaalis today forced an indefinite postponement of a retrial in the case.\n“As far as I am concerned, the case is ready for trial,” Chatham County Superior Court Judge Timothy R. Walmsley said in court Monday.\nHe said defense attorney Michael Schiavone’s appeal to the Georgia Court of Appeals on the issue of double jeopardy would have to be resolved before a new trial could begin.\n“I don’t know how long it’s going to take to come back down,” Walmsley said.\nKhaalis, 41, was scheduled for a second trial beginning today on charges of making false statements and violating his oath by a public officer in the wake of a 2010 investigation into police corruption.\nHe has pleaded not guilty and remained free on a $20,000 bond.\nHis first trial ended in a mistrial in July after d complained that prosecutors had withheld material to which the defense was entitled. He then filed a motion charging that Assistant District Attorney Jerry Rothschild Jr. had acted in bad faith and “goaded” the defense into seeking mistrial. He asked Walmsley to dismiss the case for double jeopardy.\nWalmsley rejected that claim.\n“The court finds that the prosecuting attorney did not intentionally or knowingly withhold discoverable material,” Walmsley ruled last week.\n“The late discovery was not the result of the prosecuting attorney acting in bad faith or in disregard to the basic rules of prosecutorial procedure.”\nInstead, Walmsley said, despite the prosecutor’s attempts to obtain and produce the evidence, “the late discovery disclosures were apparently the result of multiple state agencies investigating (the) defendant and failing to share their entire investigative files with one another.”\n“As there was no prosecutorial misconduct intended to goad the defense into moving for a mistrial for the benefit of the state.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/afdsasf42f_0_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/afdsasf42f_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:08:44.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
