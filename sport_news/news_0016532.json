A Ridgewood team that has its eyes set on the state tournament didn't show any let down against the Tigers. \n\"They all say how disappointed they were when they didn't make it as far as they wanted to last year,\" said freshman setter Sydney Zinkon, who finished with 13 points. \"Our goal is to make it to state, so we practice and play hard everyday.\" \nThey are the 18th ranked team in Division III and are one game away from winning at least a share of the Inter Valley Conference title, so a game against a lesser opponent could've brought their play down. But not on Senior Night, a night where they honored three players — Laura Crawford, Morgan McDorman and Allie Dobson — who have faced ups and downs heads on, that helped the team, Zinkon said. \n\"I remember watching all three of them, as freshman they were on varsity, like that was my goal when I was watching them,\" she added. \nBut in the first set, with a relatively small 10-5 lead, it wasn't a senior who stepped up. It was the freshman Zinkon, who rolled off six straight points, including two aces, to push the Generals lead up to 16-5. \nIt wasn't just Zinkon, junior Eliza Haynes tallied 17 assists and 12 digs, sophomore Erinn Buchanan totaled 10 points. On a night dedicated to the seniors, the underclassmen stepped up and showed they have skill also. \n\"They came into a year where we had to bring two new setters in and they got the job done,\" McCoy said. \"And obviously we couldn't do it without them. They have rounded out this team and I think they have had an outstanding year. Our younger girls, I look forward to seeing them into next year.\" \nWhile Ridgewood trailed in each set there was never a point in the game where they needed to worry. In the second set, they trailed 6-9, then Zinkon rattled off three straight points. Then trailing 12-15, they rattled off seven straight points to take the game over again. \nA dropped set or loss was never in doubt. \n\"They kept their intensity up for the most part,\" McCoy said. \"When we are on it's a lot of fun to watch these girls.\" \nBetween the second and third set, Crawford was honored for eclipsing the 1,000 kill mark as a Ridgewood General, so play stopped, but when it resumed Ridgewood was back on its game. \nThis wasn't the most difficult game the Generals have played, it wasn't Tuscarawas Central Catholic, but in the grand scheme of things it was just as important. They are now one win away from sharing the IVC title and one game away from starting a playoff run with eyes set on the state Final Four. \n\"I'm only a freshman. Over my high school career, I want to go clear through the IVC,\" Zinkon said. \nMcCoy said, \"We were working on things that we need to take forward into next week, so we've been talking about how we have to get everything clicking on all cylinders. All season (the players) have known what their goals are. They have taken it one game at a time. We are hoping with that attitude we will have a lot more games coming for tournaments.\" \ncteaguerob@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:48:55.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
