Ein. Uno. Jeden. En.\nRegardless of the language, it all means one (1).\nDefenseman Tyson Barrie scored the only goal in those five games, and it came in a 2-1 shootout loss to the Los Angeles Kings at the Pepsi Center on Sept. 27. Colorado went 0-4-1 in the stretch, after a 5-4 overtime victory over the Anaheim Ducks in the exhibition opener.\nGiven that exhibition games are, well, exhibition games, it all could turn out to be meaningless. Still, the offensive ineptitude raises doubts. Colorado was outshot in four of the five games, and got only 14 shots on net in the 4-0 loss to Los Angeles in Las Vegas on Saturday. And this isn't a team on a confidence-building roll heading into Thursday's season opener against the Minnesota Wild at the Pepsi Center.\n\"It's not enough, and we know that,\" Avs coach Patrick Roy said Monday. \"But at the same time, we have the quality players out there. Is it a concern? Yes, it is. ... I'd rather see that happening actually in the preseason than see it in the season.\n\"I'm not saying it's a wake-up call, but we all know we need to do better. ... I think we're trying maybe a little bit too many pretty plays. We know we have skills and sometimes it's tempting to try a little pass between the guys, and we're going to have to simplify our game and put more pucks at the net, and crash the net.\"\nAdvertisement Said veteran winger Alex Tanguay, whose 55 points last season tied Matt Duchene and Ryan O'Reilly for third on the team: \"Through the course of the season, there are going to be times we don't score goals, and that's going to be part of the process. It's better now, but certainly it's time for us to pick it up. We have to find ways to create more opportunities, to be more on the puck. The fact that we didn't score isn't as bad as the fact that we've been outshot.\"\nTanguay then asked a pointed question. Did anyone remember the Avalanche's record in exhibition games before its second Stanley Cup season of 2000-01?\nThe answer, of course, was no.\n\"I have no idea,\" Tanguay added.\n(Later, a look back at the archives revealed the answer: 5-2-1.)\n\"Certainly, the (bad) start to the season was crucial for this team last year,\" Tanguay said. \"It took us a while before we got going, and we realize the importance of that this year. We need to make sure we're ready to go.\"\nSaid Jarome Iginla: \"There's no question we have work to do. We have to work and bring our game up. We're not taking it lightly and thinking, 'Yeah, we'll be fine, it's just exhibitions.' We know we have to look at ourselves and be ready early.\"\nFootnotes. The Avs released veteran winger Curtis Glencross from his professional tryout, leaving them with only one more cut to make to get down to the 23-man roster for the regular season. The Avs have 25 players, including Jesse Winchester, who will be placed on the injured list, and Jack Skille, who seems on the verge of making the team on a professional tryout contract. ... First-round draft choice Mikko Rantanen said he hasn't been told anything, but he appears to be a lock to stick on the season-opening roster. Roy stopped just short of confirming that. Rantanen, 18, can play nine games for the Avs before his entry-level contract kicks in, and the options are to send him to San Antonio of the American Hockey League or back to TPS Turku of the Finnish league for another season. ... Roy turned 50 on Monday.\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:25:18.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
