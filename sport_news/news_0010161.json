(CHRIS KNIGHT / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) Paul Reinhard Special to The Morning Call \nSome Lafayette football alumni proudly showed off their 2013 Patriot League championship rings Saturday afternoon while attending Homecoming Day tailgate parties prior to the Leopards' game with undefeated Harvard. \nBut on the Fisher Stadium turf, the quarterback who was the catalyst for that 2013 success got another dose of the harsh reality that is 2015 when Harvard handed Lafayette its worst home shutout loss in 44 years, 42-0. \nThe last time the Leopards were shutout by more points was in 1971 when Delaware handed them a 49-0 shellacking. \nDrew Reed got his break as a freshman at the half of what turned out to be a losing effort at Harvard in 2013 and then led Lafayette over four straight league opponents to get the championship. \nBut the free-wheeling Reed could never get going on Saturday against a Harvard team that was well aware of Lafayette's running-game deficiency. \nReed was buried under four sacks for a total of 43 yards lost, and that doomed Lafayette, which was already last among all Football Championship Subdivision teams in rushing average, to minus-18 yards on the ground and only 197 yards overall while losing for the sixth time in seven games this season.

(CHRIS KNIGHT / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) \nAt the same time, Harvard, which begins the more difficult part of its schedule next weekend when it meets Princeton, rolled up 500 yards of total offense on 83 plays to win for the 13th straight time on the road and the 19th straight time overall. \nHarvard came to Easton with 62 players dressed and ready to go. It left at least that many of its players at home. Meanwhile, Harvard Coach Tim Murphy counted the Lafayette players and got a total of 59. \n\"They're a really banged up team,\" Murphy said when a reporter asked him and his players whether they had any hint that the game would be as easy as it was. \"They've had more injuries than I've seen in a long time. That was certainly a critical factor in the game,\" said Murphy, a former Lafayette assistant coach. \nAs he has so many times this season, Tavani again alluded to some of the roster problems that have stood in the way of progress for the Leopards this year. But at the same time, he said, \"Nobody is screaming and yelling and carrying on. Everyone is working extremely hard … losing begets losing and winning begets winning, and when you're on this kind of skid, it's really hard to get back out of. Until we get some more key guys back.\" \nLafayette now is assured of its sixth straight losing season, but Tavani noted that the remaining games, beginning with next weekend at Holy Cross, are all league games …\"winnable games.\" \nSaturday, however, was an uphill battle from the start. \nHarvard is a senior-dominated team, and its maturity showed. With quarterback Scott Hosch, running back Paul Stanton and tight end Ben Braunecker leading the way, the Crimson, which is now 5-0 and heads into its Ivy schedule for the remainder of the season, put together drives of 90, 80, 77 and 70 yards with its balanced offensive assault. \nFor Lafayette one of the biggest problems, again, was third-down play. Before Murphy went to his reserves in the fourth quarter, Harvard was 13-for-17 on third-down conversions. Lafayette, on the other hand, was 1-for-12 during the same stretch and finished 2-for-15. \nStanton rushed 18 times for 123 yards and two touchdowns — a 16-yarder that gave the Crimson its first score and a one-yarder later. He was stopped for a loss only once by the Lafayette defense. \nHosch was 17-for-29 passing for 272 yards and a touchdown. Braunecker had six catches for 123 yards and a touchdown. \n\"Clearly, we'll be playing the best team we've played this year,\" Murphy said of Princeton, which, along with Yale, Dartmouth and maybe even Penn could make things interesting in the weeks ahead. \n\"We're a good team; we've proved that. We haven't had much adversity yet. We're going to get some adversity. You don't know where it's going to be but it's going to happen. I feel really good about how we will handle that.\" \nHarvard has now won 16 of 19 games against Lafayette, which last won in 2009 in Massachusetts. The Leopards and the Crimson don't meet in 2016, but they do play in 2017 at Harvard. \nLafayette had some opportunities to put points on the board, but the Leopards were 0-for-2 in red zone scoring chances. The best came when the Leopards drove to the Harvard 14, where Reed connected with wide receiver Matt Mrazek for an apparent touchdown, only to have ittaken away by a holding penalty. Lafayette eventually lost the ball on downs at the Crimson 10. \nThe Leopards got to the Harvard 14 early in the fourth quarter, but Reed was thrown for an eight-yard loss as he tried to pass on a fourth-and-2. \nLafayette had to go to a third tight end after senior co-captain Bobby DePietro had surgery on an injured knee on Friday. He went out for the pregame coin toss using crutches. Then in the third quarter of the game, center Tanner Kern injured an ankle and had to be helped off the field. Tavani said immediate X-rays were negative but he couldn't give any more information about Kern's immediate future. \nRetired sports columnist Paul Reinhard is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:56:40.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
