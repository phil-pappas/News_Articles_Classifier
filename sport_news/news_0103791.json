Marshals said Johnson was found at a Motel 6 on Jimmy Carter Boulevard off I-85 in Norcross.\nSupervisory Inspector Jim Joyner with the US Marshals Service said when deputy marshals opened the room door Johnson \"was very shocked.\" He was booked into the Gwinnett County Jail. He is not facing any charges in Georgia and is awaiting extradition back to Louisiana.\n\"Fortunately through the combined efforts of the involved law enforcement agencies we were able to apprehend this man before he could do any further harm,\" Middle Louisiana US Marshal Kevin Harrison said in a written release. \"I cannot over emphasize the investigative tenacity of the pursuing officers, dogged seems to be the most fitting expression.\"\nJohnson was wanted by law enforcement after being mistakenly released on September 23 from the Dixon Correctional Institute in Jackson, Louisiana. He was serving a 40-year sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter and illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nAccording to officials with the Department of Corrections, early indications show Johnson was getting released from Dixon on good behavior for prior charges. When his name was run in the system, the manslaughter conviction did not appear, so he was let go. Johnson, however, had an outstanding charge for battery of a correctional officer.\nAfter being released from Dixon, Johnson was picked up and booked into the East Feliciana Parish Detention Center and processed for the battery charge. A $10,000 bond was issued. Johnson posted bond and was released from prison.\nOfficials said the person responsible for the mistakes at the Dixon facility will face disciplinary action.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
