They averaged 4.8 runs in the playoffs entering the NLCS series, but have been held to just 1.7 a game against Mets pitching.\n\"We're not where we want to be, but teams have done it before,\" said first baseman Anthony Rizzo.\n\"I don't want to be down 3-0, obviously, but we are and we'll be ready to go tomorrow. That's all we can do. Our backs are against the wall, just keep swinging.\"\n(Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:47:58.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
