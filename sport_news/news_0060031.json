They dusted themselves off and got ready for their match later in the evening against Kimberly, putting the loss in the rearview mirror. \n“As a team, they’re just solid,” Fond du Lac’s Michael Barbeau said of North. “We’ve got a lot of young guys, not a lot of experience, and they’ve got a lot of experience. We just have to stick with it.” \nThe Lightning used an array of talented hitters to crush an undersized Fond du Lac team that tried throwing a few different wrinkles into the gameplan, but to no avail. \n“They’re the No. 2-ranked team in the state for a reason,” Fond du Lac coach Scott Stelmacher said. “We’ve literally been practicing and focusing on this match for two weeks. We had a couple wrinkles put in and I had a couple of things in my back pocket to try on them and they were able to counter everything we did. They’ve got such an effective middle attack that, if you don’t have somebody that can jump through the roof and is lightning-quick like them, it’s really hard to stop.” \nBarbeau had three kills and seven digs for the Cardinals, while Will Mockert added 10 assists. Blake Badtke had four kills and Ethan Kondo chipped in with six digs. \nWith Appleton North likely to be in the running for a state title in 2015, Tuesday’s loss can probably be considered an aberration on an otherwise solid season for the Cardinals. \nSitting in the middle of the pack in the Fox Valley Association, Fond du Lac has proven it can stay competitive with nearly any team in the state. The driving force behind the Cardinals in 2015 is Barbeau, a senior outside hitter, who works hard and does a little bit of everything on the court. \n“Michael is the consummate pro,” Stelmacher said. “We had a field trip down to Madison earlier this year and he sat away from the other guys because he wanted to watch the game, he didn’t want to be a high school guy. He wanted to watch the game and learn from it and then he started asking me questions about what I saw later on.” \n“I just stay focused,” Barbeau added. “I put the work in and try to get the results. I try to get my team better. I’m not a yeller or anything, I just try to pick everyone up so no one’s left behind. I make sure everyone’s on the same page with everything. ... I’ve developed into more of an all-around player. I started off just hitting, it’s more fun, but I’d say I’m more of an all-around player.” \nWith the postseason coming up shortly, the Cardinals will need Barbeau and the rest of the squad to step up if they hope to make a push deep into the playoffs. \n“Definitely in the past few weeks we’ve gotten a lot better as a team,” Barbeau said. “Everyone’s picking each other up and not getting down on anyone. Everything I think has improved and I think when we’re playing our best, we can beat anyone. We’ve proven that in our tournaments. ... It’s a fun team.” \nFond du Lac defeated Kimberly 2-1 (20-25, 25-22, 16-14) in the second match of Tuesday's triangular. \nAppleton North def. Fond du Lac, 25-15, 25-14; Fond du Lac def. Kimberly, 20-25, 25-22, 16-14. \nStat Leaders: Fond du Lac — Michael Barbeau 15 kills; Blake Badtke 9 kills; Will Mockert 21 assists; Ian Spletter 4 blocks; Ethan Kondo 15 digs. \nSam Oleson: (920) 907-7930, soleson@gannett.com or follow on Twitter @sam_olesonFDL 10 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1RURkoh TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:22:13.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
