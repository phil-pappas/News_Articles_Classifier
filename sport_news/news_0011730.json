Plus, outfielder Andre Ethier already had a diving catch under his belt . \nSo why would Ethier suddenly get caught by TBS cameras screaming at his own manager, Don Mattingly? \nPLUS: Should Mets use Syndergaard out of bullpen in Game 5? \nCheck out the video above: Not long after Ethier lined out to left field with teammate Justin Turner on second base, he let Mattingly have it in the dugout over ... something. \nTBS' booth, which included ex-Met Ron Darling, speculated that Mattingly might have told Ethier the veteran should have found a way to move Turner to third base instead of lining out. Ethier, perhaps, might have said something to Mattingly along the lines of, \"Well, you try hitting Jacob deGrom's fastballs!\" \nFollow Charles Curtis on Twitter @charlescurtis82 .
