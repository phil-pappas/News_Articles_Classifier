By Dennis Knight\nSavannah Christian’s Demetris Robertson was honored Monday at a ceremony on campus where he was presented his No. 16 jersey for the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, which will be played in San Antonio, Texas in the Alamodome on January 9.\nThe senior has been a star at running back and safety for the Raiders (6-1) this season. He is one of the top recruits in the country and is being recruited as a wide receiver or a defensive back.\nSCPS coach Donald Chumley said Robertson is more than a great football player.\n“I’ve coached some great athletes, and everyone knows about the God-given talent that Demetris has,” said Chumley, who was invited to come to Texas for the All-American game at the ceremony. “But he has been a pleasure to coach. He has a great attitude toward life, school, his teammates and his classmates. He is a great student-athlete, who just happens to play football. Demetris is going to be a success in whatever he chooses to do.”\nRobertson recently told Southernpigskin.com that Stanford and Alabama were among the top schools on his list. Many of the Army All-American players make their verbal commitments during the game, which is broadcast by NBC, but Robertson said he will wait until National Signing Day, on Feb. 2 to announce his decision.\n“I’ve got a lot of great schools recruiting me, so I’m going to take the time to make the decision with my family,” Robertson said.\nPlaying in the game, which was attended by more than 35,000 fans last year, is a dream come true for Robertson. The U.S. All-American bowl website notes that 36 players selected in the 2014 NFL draft were alumni of the game. Ninety of the top players in the country are selected for the game.\n“It’s an honor to be chosen for this game. I’m going to play it for my school and my country,” Robertson said. “I can’t wait to get out there and compete with all the best players. I’m going to represent Raider Nation and my family.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14822314.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14822314.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:16:39.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
