Last year I looked for my scoring a lot more than the team. This year, with the ball in my hands, I have to set the tempo.” \nThat tempo is supposed to be high-octane, which means aggressive pressure defense as Whitehead and Carrington log 30-35 minutes per game. Last year, on a squad that did not push as much, they averaged 28 and 25, respectively. \nIsaiah Whitehead (Photo: USA Today) \n“We’re working a little harder now because it’s only us now — me, Isaiah and (projected sixth man) Derrick Gordon,” Carrington said. “We did a lot of conditioning in the preseason and I think we’re going to be prepared.” \nSeton Hall hasn’t employed true run-and-gun since Bobby Gonzalez, but that came with a slew of fouls. The foul situation this season bears watching, especially since officials are supposed to crack down on perimeter contact. Is Angel Delgado the Big East's best big man? \n“There’s going to be a lot of ticky-tack fouls this year,” Carrington said. “The big emphasis is on not fouling and moving your feet.” \nHall coach Kevin Willard said this is the most athletic, defensive-minded group he’s had in six seasons at the helm. The key to playing more aggressively, aside from athleticism, is the ability to make good decisions on the fly. Such maturity is what all parties feel emerged from the ashes of last year’s late-season meltdown. \n“It might sound crazy but I’m thankful for what we went through at the end of the season,” Carrington said. “Now we know what that feels like, and we don’t want to go through it again.” \nThe Pirates lost nine of their final 10 games and two-thirds of their starting backcourt transferred. \nKhadeen Carrington (Photo: Seton Hall Athletics) \n“We know there are going to be down times, but you keep your composure, keep your head straight and move on,” Whitehead said. \nTwo things are helping behind the scenes. One is Kansas State transfer Jevon Thomas, a point guard who is ineligible for games but is practicing. \n“He’s one of those annoying guys who’s always on you (defensively), but he’s getting us ready for league play,” Carrington said. “I’m thankful that he’s here. He’s going to play a big part in the betterment of me and Isaiah.” 5 takeaways, 5 quotes from Big East media day \nAnother is the presence of associate head coach Shaheen Holloway, an all-time Pirate playmaker who along with Willard has developed two superb lead guards in the past in Jordan Theodore and Sterling Gibbs. \n“Sha’s a perfectionist,” Carrington said. “If you don’t do it right, he’s going to make you do it over and over again. That’s what I like about him.” \nCarrington and Whitehead said they’ve never seen the clip of Holloway’s coast-to-coast drive that beat Oregon in the first round of the 2000 NCAA Tournament. They vowed to check it out. What they’ll see is a fine example of what the Pirates need out of their young guards this winter: pushing with a purpose. \nStaff writer Jerry Carino: jcarino@gannettnj.com . 8 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LHWTWf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:13:01.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
