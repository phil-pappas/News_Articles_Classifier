(Photo by Alan White) Tim Schwartz Contact Reporter Malik Anderson's two fourth quarter scores lifts undefeated Howard to a 29-22 win at Oakland Mills on Friday \nWith the score tied at 15-15 entering the fourth quarter, 5-foot-6 Malik Anderson wanted the ball. Howard’s best player wanted to decide the outcome of the biggest Howard County football game of the season. \nHis team listened, and the running back got the job done. Anderson ran the ball 11 times for 84 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner, in the final quarter alone to lead the Lions to a 29-22 victory at Oakland Mills on a windy, rainy Friday night in a battle of undefeated teams. \n“I was hoping they would give me the ball,” said Anderson. “This is one of the biggest games I’ve played in high school.” \n\"This is what high school football is all about right here,\" said Howard coach Bruce Strunk. \"It wasn’t the perfect night for either team, but it’s high school football, and it was a great game.” \nHoward quarterback Casey Crawford completed seven of 20 passes for 147 yards and two touchdown passes, one each to Cameron Carlyle and Dylan Perez, and Anderson finished with 30 carries for 183 yards and two scores to lead the Lions (5-0). \nEvery Thursday of each week, Howard County Times football beat reporter Tim Schwartz ranks the Howard County teams based on their body of work this fall.

This is what the game was supposed to be,” said Strunk. “Our kids came to play and it could have went either way. ... Malik is the toughest kid I’ve ever coached. He was running with an attitude tonight. Stats don’t matter in these types of games. It’s all about the effort. ... I think we wore their defense out.\" \nThe Lions scored first on their second drive, going 11 plays and 48 yards. Crawford’s 10-yard pass to Perez and a Michael Gillespie kick put Howard up 7-0. \nOakland Mills, however, bounced back on its ensuring drive. Scorpions’ quarterback Tre Hopkins ran for 55 yards on the second play, and Daquan Williams-Day scored from eight yards out. Jordan Hopkins caught a two-point conversion to give his team an 8-7 lead early in the second quarter. \nOakland Mills (4-1) extended its lead to 15-7 by capitalizing on a Lions fumble at their own 28-yard line. Jordan Hopkins caught a 10-yard pass from Tre Hopkins for the score midway through the second quarter. \nHoward, however, answered to tie the game with only three second left before halftime thanks to Crawford’s arm. Carlyle caught a 37-yard pass up the middle, and two plays later he caught another pass for a 26-yard score. Perez ran in the two-point conversion to tie the game, 15-15. \n“We thought we could throw on them,” Strunk said. “The weather kind of hurt us a little bit, but Casey still came through. We had some great catches as well.” \nAnderson took over the game to start the fourth quarter, and got his first score on the opening drive of the final stanza. The Lions went 60 yards on six plays, five of which were Anderson runs, including a 16-yarder to give his team a 22-15 lead. \nWhat happened in the Scorpions next drive was about as unique a play anyone will see in a high school football game. On fourth down and five from their own 38, Tre Hopkins completed a pass to wide receiver Shawn Harris, who looked to be stopped by lateraled the ball back to Hopkins. He picked the ball up on a bounce at the 28 and ran down the left sideline for a 72-yard score and tie the game at 22-22. \n“I was confused. I kind of saw it happening though, because Tre was calling for Shawn to give him the ball, and then I saw him throw it and Tre took it and he was gone,” Anderson said. “I knew that was going to be a problem.” \n“I thought that gave us a ton of momentum, but we were playing a good team,” said Oakland Mills coach Tom Browne. “He’s a gutsy kid, he’s quick. We always have a chance with a kid like (Tre Hopkins). It’s fun to coach a kid like that, but at the end of the day we have to finish.” \nIt was for naught, however, as Howard rode the back of Anderson once more. The Lions only needed eight plays to go 80 yards, which included a 50-yard catch and run Perez. But it was Anderson that finished off the drive with runs of five-, six-, six- and six-yards, the last of which was his second touchdown of the night and what turned out to be the game-winner with the score 29-22. \nMuddy McHemba, wearing number 88 in honor of 2014 Defensive Player of the Year Winston Delattiboudere, sacked the ever-elusive Tre Hopkins on a second and 11 for a 14-yard loss on the Scorpions final drive to halt any chance of a comeback. \n“It was really big. I expected it from him,” Anderson said. “I told him before the game, I was like, if you wear the 88, you need to play like (Delattiboudere), and that’s what he did right there. He played just like him, and I’m proud of him. It really set the tone.” \n“That was awesome,” added Strunk. “Muddy has come a long way. He’s a good player, and he’s only a junior. We have some good things ahead with him.” \nThe loss is a disappointing one for Oakland Mills. Tre Hopkins finished with 23 rushes for 147 yards, 83 yards passing and the game-tying 72-yard fumble recovery for a score, but it wasn’t enough to pull out the victory. \n“I told my kids you were going to get punched in the mouth, but you have to punch back,” said Oakland Mills coach Tom Browne. “And that’s exactly what happened. We played a good football team in Howard, but we’re a good football team too. That’s what it looked like tonight. … We have nothing to hold our heads about.” \nHoward (5-0) – 7 8 0 14 – 29 \nOakland Mills (4-1) – 0 15 0 7 – 22 \nOther scores: \nRiver Hill (2-3) – 0 6 6 0 – 12 \nMarriotts Ridge (4-1) – 6 0 0 0 – 6 \n(Story to come) \nAtholton (2-3) – 2 0 0 7 – 9 \nHammond (2-3) – 0 0 0 0 – 0 \nFirst quarter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:56:19.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
