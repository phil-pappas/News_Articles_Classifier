This week the sophomore faces another big challenge against a team with another stellar quarterback in Fannin County and Brad Davis. It won't be an easy night for either defense, as both can rely on their arms and legs. And while Dawson currently holds the lead in 7-AAA, Fannin County has just one region loss and is still in a position to contend for the 7-AAA crown. \nCertainly Dawson County -- which, at 4-2 and 3-0 in 7-AAA, has already doubled its win total from last season -- will feel confident with Watson pulling the trigger. \nRecently, Friday Game Night editor Morgan Lee caught up with Watson to talk about his performance on Friday, the advancement of the Tigers program under new coach Sid Maxwell and what it means for Dawson County down the stretch. \n2015 Locos Grill and Pub Friday Game Night Players of the Week Week 1 -- Colby Wood, Jefferson, Running Back Week 2 -- Joseph Mancuso, Union County, Quarterback Week 3 -- Messiah Dorsey, Gainesville, Quarterback Week 4 -- Malik Tuck, Jackson County, Running Back Week 5 -- Brock Landis, Winder-Barrow, Quarterback Week 6 -- Trevae Cain, Banks County, Running Back Week 7 -- Coey Watson, Dawson County, Quarterback", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:03:15.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
