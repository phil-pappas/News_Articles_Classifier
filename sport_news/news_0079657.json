Now that was a scare.\nMartin Luther King played a scoreless first half and trailed by a goal 48 minutes into the action, but the top-seeded Knights rallied to defeat second-seeded Curtis, 2-1, in the 'P' bracket of the PSAL quarterfinals at Randall’s Island on Monday.\nTrailing 1-0, MLK freshman midfielder Jethro Dede scored in the 56th minute to tie the match. Star striker Moriken Sangary netted the decisive score in the 69th minute.\n“I said, ‘If I get a chance, I’m going to put it away,’” said Sangary.\nSangary’s goal came about one minute after Curtis's bench thought referees missed a hand ball call on a near goal that required MLK defender Mbaye Fall to make a save behind goalkeeper Moulaye Traore , who had come out a bit too far from the net.\nCurtis coach Joyce Simonson blasted officials after the match, saying they favored MLK.\n“It’s very hard to play against 11 players and the refs,” Simonson said. “I feel like we should have had a fairer game. I feel we didn’t get obvious calls. I think we deserved better calls. I think we deserved at least a handball down there.”\nShe also took exception with MLK coach Martin Jacobson not shaking her hand immediately after the match. Jacobson was absent from the initial postgame handshake but hurried back to shake Simonson’s hand later.\nShe said it was too late.\n“Look, you play the game and you won, shake the other coach’s hand,” Simonson said. “It’s just that simple. You’re not the king of the world.\"\nCurtis played MLK more physically than it did in last year’s 6-0 quarterfinals loss to the Knights, but it couldn’t prevent the 12-time defending league champion from advancing to its 16th straight semifinal.\nAfter limiting MLK’s chances during a scoreless first half, Christian Aldaz kicked in a goal to give Curtis a 1-0 lead in the 48th minute.\nThat goal got Jacobson nervous, as he said he began clutching a “3,000-year-old” crystal from New Mexico that he had in his pocket as a good luck charm.\n“We were totally out of sync,” said Jacobson, whose Knights were once again playing without midfielders Ibrahim Diaby and Tarek Beckles , who were serving the second game of a red-card suspension for arguing with refs last week. “I never seen us like this all year.”\nJust minutes later, MLK responded when Dede found an opening and netted a score.\nTen minutes later the Warriors made a drive and appeared to be on teh verge of scoring when Traore came out too far, but Mbaye deflected the by ball with his head. Curtis yelled for a hand ball call but refs didn’t blow their whistle. A minute later, Sangary found the left corner of the net from about 15 yards away.\nFor Thursday's semifinal against Beacon, MLK will have Diaby and Beckles back in its lineup.\nMeanwhile, Curtis is left to wonder about what could have been.\n“This is a very hard loss because I think and I know that we played very even with them,” Simonson said. \"They didn’t roll over us.\"\nOther quarterfinal results:\nPSAL 'L' Bracket\nBeacon 3, Adams 2\nJoseph Nikic had a hat trick to rally Beacon to victory. Nikic's first goal came just 35 seconds into the game but the Spartans actually took a 2-1 lead into halftime on a strength of a 29th-minute score from Bruno Ramirez and a 37th-minute strike from Rodolfo Paguada .\nNikic scored five minutes apart in the second half.\nPSAL 'S' Bracket\nFrancis Lewis 3, Bryant 0\nDaniel Castro , Fadil Paljevic and Nathaniel Richardson each scored goals to lead Francis Lewis, which will meet Tottenville in the other semifinal on Thursday.\nPSAL 'A' Bracket\nTottenville 2, Bayside 0\nSenior Marco Mingozzi netted a goal in each half to lead the Pirates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:57:08.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
