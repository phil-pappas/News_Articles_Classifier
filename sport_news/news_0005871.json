(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) \nOXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Chad Kelly threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns to lead No. 14 Mississippi over New Mexico State 52-3 on Saturday. \nKelly, who came into the day leading the Southeastern Conference in passing, has topped 300 yards in four of his six games. He completed 24 of 33 throws. \nLaquon Treadwell caught eight passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns, including one on a spectacular one-handed grab down the right sideline. \nThe Rebels (5-1) finished with 665 yards of total offense. Eugene Brazley ran for a team-high 98 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown. \nNew Mexico State (0-5) couldn’t convert a few good opportunities after Ole Miss turnovers. The Aggies missed on two field goal attempts. The Aggies’ Nick Jeanty completed 11 of 22 passes for 74 yards. \nOle Miss needed a good performance after a sobering 38-10 loss to Florida last week in The Swamp. \nFor the most part, the Rebels delivered. \nKelly was accurate most of the afternoon and the running game averaged nearly eight yards per carry. The Rebels had four sacks, including one by junior linebacker Terry Caldwell, who started his first game in place of the injured C.J. Johnson. \nThere were a few sloppy moments. The Rebels quickly drove down the field on their first possession, but bogged down on first-and-goal at the 9 and settled for a field goal. \nThe punt return unit had two turnovers. Carlos Davis fumbled twice, recovering one while New Mexico State recovered the other. On another punt, the Rebels’ D.K. Buford lost sight of a bouncing ball and let it hit his foot. It was recovered by the New Mexico State. \nIt didn’t matter against the obviously overmatched Aggies. But Ole Miss will need a cleaner performance next weekend when they go on the road to face a much-improved Memphis team that has won 12 straight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:46:53.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
