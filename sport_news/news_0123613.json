(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) (Photo: AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nRutgers has seen its fair share of tough matchups during a 2-3 start, but the Scarlet Knights certainly aren’t done yet. Below, we present five of the best players Rutgers must still face with seven games left in the regular season. \n1. Jordan Howard, RB, Indiana: A transfer from UAB, Howard leads the Big Ten and is seventh nationally in rushing yards per game at 143.2. His 709 tushing yards rank him second in the Big Ten and 11th nationally. Howard has rushed for at least 145 yards in four of the five games he has played in this season, highlighted by 203 yards on 31 carries in a 38-35 win over Western Kentucky on Sept. 19. \nHoward had just 34 yards on 14 carries against Ohio State on Oct. 3 and left the game early with an ankle injury. The junior missed last week’s loss at Penn State and is considered questionable for Saturday when the Hoosiers host Rutgers in Bloomington. \n2. Ezekiel Elliott, RB, Ohio State: Howard is second in the Big Ten in rushing yards because of Elliott. \nElliott, who is the league co-leader in scoring with 60 points, burst onto the national scene late last season, rushing for 696 yards between the Big Ten championship game, College Football Playoff semifinal and College Football Playoff national championship game. The beat has not slowed down as Elliott’s 835 rushing yards lead the Big Ten and place him fourth nationally. \nOn a team full of weapons on both sides of the ball, Elliott’s play has made him a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate for the top-ranked Buckeyes. \n3. Tommy Armstrong, QB, Nebraska: The Cornhuskers are 0-2 in the Big Ten and their four losses have come by a combined 11 points, but Armstrong has been a huge bright spot. \nA junior, Armstrong leads the Big Ten in total offense with 1,706 yards and total yards per game at 284.3. He has thrown for over 300 yards three times this season, topped off by 368 yards and two touchdowns on 23-for-35 passing in a Sept. 26 win over Southern Mississippi. \nIn last year’s meeting with Rutgers, a 42-24 Cornhuskers win in Lincoln, Armstrong went 14-for-22 for 163 yards and two scores. That effort complemented Ameer Abdullah, who rushed for 225 yards and three scores as part of a school-record 341 all-purpose yards. \n4. Jabrill Peppers, S, Michigan: The Wolverines are playing defense at a historic level right now, having registered three straight shutouts, while not giving up more than seven points since it yielded 24 to Utah in the Sept. 3 season-opener. \nAny number of Michigan defensive players could go in this spot, but we’ll go with the former Don Bosco Prep and Paramus Catholic star, who is living up to the hype. Through six games, Peppers has 21 tackles (17 solo), 4.5 tackles for a loss and five pass break-ups. \nWith Peppers in the defensive backfield, the Wolverines rank No. 1 in the Big Ten and No. 2 nationally in passing yards allowed at 115.5 per game. \n5. Will Likely, CB, Maryland: If neither Maryland, nor Rutgers is in contention for a bowl game when the two meet in the season-finale on Nov. 28, you’re going to want to circle this game anyway because Likely should be matched up with Leonte Carroo. \nAside from his exploits in Maryland’s defensive backfield, Likely has also made a name for himself returning kicks. He leads the Big Ten in punt return average (22.6), third in kick return average (20.8) and sixth in all-purpose yards per game at 114.0. \nLast year against Rutgers, Likely had a career-high 12 tackles, while Carroo had six catches for 104 yards and two touchdowns in a 41-38 Scarlet Knights win. \nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RHdevg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:48:28.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
