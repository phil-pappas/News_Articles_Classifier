We’re going over to face some adversity, and it’ll be good for us.”\nThe question is which Bills will be healthy enough to face that challenge.\nReceiver Sammy Watkins (left ankle), defensive tackle Kyle Williams (left knee), offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson (concussion) and receiver Marquise Goodwin (ribs) were hurt against Cincinnati, and their status is uncertain against Jacksonville.\nThen there are the regulars who were already sidelined on Sunday, including starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor (left knee), receiver Percy Harvin (hip), backup running back Karlos Williams (concussion) and receiver Marcus Easley (shoulder).\nRyan declined to provide updates on the status of his injured players following the game, and isn’t scheduled to address reporters until the Bills hold their first practice on Wednesday.\nWhat complicates matters is how restricted the Bills will be if they intend to bring in reinforcements, who will require a valid passport to travel to Britain.\n“No, it’s not easy logistically,” general manager Doug Whaley said.\n“It’s going to put us in a bind.”\nThe Bills’ defence is another concern.\nThe pass rush has dried up. Buffalo has managed just nine sacks in six games, well off the pace of the past two years in which the Bills topped 50.\nAgainst the Bengals, the Bills failed to register a sack or generate a turnover in the same game for the first time since a 44-7 loss at Dallas on Nov. 13, 2011.\nAnd they’ve not been shut out at home in both categories since a 38-14 loss to the New York Jets on Oct. 3, 2010.\nThe defence on third down was also an issue against the Bengals, who converted 7 of 12 opportunities. The 58 per cent conversion rate matched the highest against Buffalo since New England went 7 of 12 on Nov. 11, 2012.\nThis is not what was expected from a unit that features two defensive lineman with $100-million (U.S.) contracts – Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus – and returned mostly intact after leading the league in sacks and allowing the fourth-fewest yards last season.\nRyan placed the blame on himself and finally began acknowledging that he might be holding back too much when it comes to pressuring the pocket.\n“I went with some three-man rush stuff and never let my guys go as much as I should have,” Ryan said.\n“We’ve got to take a long hard look at what we’re asking our guys to do.”\nIt doesn’t help that the Bills may be without one of their front-line anchors in Kyle Williams.\nAnd they’re already missing starting safety Aaron Williams, who was placed on short-term injured reserve last week because of a neck injury.\n“We’re banged up. The only thing that’s certain is we’ve got a game on Sunday,” receiver Robert Woods said.\n“We’re going to London with what we have. I think it’s a must-win situation.”\n NFL owners approve expansion of international series through 2025\nNew York Jets bring their own toilet paper to England\nBlue Jays hand title for longest playoff drought to Buffalo Bills\nComments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:06:01.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
