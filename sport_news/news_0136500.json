When Boys & Girls senior Robert Rhodes received the baton in first place on the anchor leg of the 4x800-meter relay at the Marine Corps Holiday Classic at the Armory on Tuesday, his legs didn’t want to cooperate.\nHis will, however, was unshaken.\n“I was really tired,” said Rhodes, who had finished second to Columbus’ Strymar Livingston in the Invitational 800 earlier in the day. “(But) everybody did what they were supposed to do. I had to bring that in for them.”\nRhodes withstood a furious push from George Kelly of New Jersey power Christian Brothers Academy in the last 150 meters to lead the quartet that also included Javaun Grant, Darryl Williams and Lashley Winter to a 7:56.26 win, nearly a 10-second improvement on last year’s indoor best.\n“I had more talent last year but I have a better group of kids this year,” said Boys & Girls coach James Jackson . “It makes a difference.”\nCollegiate’s relay of Marco Pompilj , Will Garcia , J.P. Meredith and Alex McDonald placed third in 7:59.18, a promising debut considering that senior Will McDuffie is still recovering from an injury.\nLivingston and Rhodes, PSAL rivals, gapped an impressive field in the Invitational 800 meters before Livingston pulled away, 1:52.94-1:53.81.\n“Actually, I run faster when I run against (Rhodes),” said Livingston.\nLivingston, who is the national indoor record-holder at 600 meters, has added strength-training to his repertoire this season.\nPace, Bryan Freelance NYDN In the Invitational 800, winner Strymar Livingston (picture here during a different meet) finishes ahead of Boys & Girls standout Robert Rhodes. “Last year I probably went into the weight room twice,” said Livingston. “I’ve been working with (Columbus coach Steve) Bonica and my club coaches (with New Horizons). It’s really helping.”\nLivingston, who opened the indoor season with a 34.71 300-meter win at the PSAL Night of the Sprints Friday, is being tracked by a number of major colleges.\n“I’m looking at Arizona State, LSU, Tennessee and South Carolina,” said Livingston, who said he’ll take official visits to schools in January. “There’s a lot more (too). I’m going to make a decision (during) the season.”\nFarrell faced a loaded field that included Christian Brothers Academy and Rochester-area power Rush-Henrietta in the Championship Boys Distance Medley. After Alex Lo Presti , Rob Kesicki and Harry Gumb got anchor Dan Galford the stick in seventh place, the junior closed with a 4:18 1,600-meter leg to propel Farrell to third, in 10:30.43.\n“When I got the stick I was a little afraid I would go out too hard,” said Galford. “I was patient...It just wasn’t enough today.”\nLong Island power North Shore continues to send shockwaves through the sport. In the Championships Girls Distance Medley Relay, Brianna Nerud , Lea Farrell, Elizabeth Caldwell and Samantha Nadel combined for the sixth-fastest high school time in U.S. history, 11:43.23.\n“We really just wanted to come here and see what we could do,” said Nerud, whose team set the 4x1500-meter U.S. record at the Armory on Dec. 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:48:39.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
