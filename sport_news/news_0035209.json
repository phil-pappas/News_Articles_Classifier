Thanks to a weather delay, the two schools didn't finish playing until close to one o'clock in the morning. Dalton versus Rome was a game for the ages because it lasted for ages. How 'bout nearly five-and-a-half hours. Said head coach Matt Land-\"The uniqueness of it was it was a region game. We had to finish the game. Neither one of us wanted to come back the next night. We were going to come back to the same sloppy field.\" Reporter-\"Were there any rules about what time and how long a game can be played in Georgia?\" Said Land-\"Not on the weekend there's not.\" With Dalton up 14-9 with roughly eight minutes to go in the third quarter, a lightening delay occurred that lasted almost three hours. Reporter-\"What the heck are ya'll doing for three hours?\" Said tight end Wyatt Erwin -\"Trying to keep focused, but I mean two-and-a-half hours with 80 of your best friends is kind of hard.\" Added defensive line Jake Myers-\"It was cold in there, so we just kind of wrapped up in these tarps. Pretty much took a nap.\" The teams finally returned to the field after midnight. Since it was a new day, why not wear new uniforms. Said Land-\"After we got through playing checkers and cards, it was like what's left? We finally decided to change into our red uniforms, our all red uniforms. Like I said, that was great because it took up some time. I think that kept them focused. Kept their minds alert.\" Dalton won 28-9, and the late hour finish did not deter some victory celebrations. Said Erwin-\"Me and my friend Jake over here. We go to IHOP after the game. That's what we always do.\"| Reporter-\"What did you do after THIS game?\" Chuckles Erwin,-\"We went to IHOP.\" Reporter-\"What's your go-to-meal at IHOP?\" Said Myers-\"Definitely the double chocolate-chip pancakes with the funny face on it.\" Said Land-\"This is one of those great memories that you're going to have in high school that in 23 years, I don't have anybody that's going to have that kind of memory.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:11:16.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
