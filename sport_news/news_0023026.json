Cameron Metarko headed in the game-winner five minutes into the first overtime period off an assist from Jacob Grano. “We’ve been working on set pieces. It was a nice service from Jake on the free kick and Cameron was where he needed to be,” Corning head coach Steve Mastronardi said. “We were in a win or go home situation and the team answered the call and did what it needed to do.” The Hawks (5-7-2) opened the scoring 12 minutes into the game when a Metarko corner kick found the foot of Ben Terwilliger – who found the net. Elmira answered about eight minutes later when Logan Brimmer scored off a loose ball in the box. Each team had some scoring chances in the second half, but Corning keeper Erik Ekstrom and Express goalie Luke Baldwin were up to task. On the day Ekstrom and Baldwin stopped eight shots apiece. Mastronardi lauded the Hawks defense for containing Elmira’s top scorers. “I was very proud of those guys,” Mastronardi said. The sectional seeding meeting will be held Wednesday. LCAA Bath 1, Livonia 0 LIVONIA | Bath got a goal from Brooks Parsons and a shutout from its defense in a 1-0 win over Livonia Monday. “This is the first time we’ve beaten them since 2011,” Bath head coach Matt Hill said. “We had lost the last 10 games to them – so this was big.” Parsons’ goal came 13 minutes into the game on a direct kick. “He was 22 yards away and knocked it inot the lower right hand corner,” Hill said. Livonia (12-2) out-shot the Rams 17-13, but was stymied by Bath’s defenders. “To get a shutout of Livonia in Livonia – it’s a big deal,” Hill said. “We got great play from Casey Hyer, Nick Strong, Logan Strong and Connor Strong on defense. “(Goalie) Steven Binkowski played a heckuva game.” On the day, Binkowski stopped nine shots.
