To this day, I don't know who was at those talks,\" said Niersbach.\nEventually there was an agreement on the 250 million francs, \"but in return 10 million francs (then worth 6.7 million euros) must be transferred to the (FIFA) finance commission,\" he added.\nBeckenbauer was ready then to put up the 10 million with his private funds, but his manager had advised him to stay out of the issue, said Niersbach.\nSubsequently, it was the then chief executive of Adidas, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who put up the 10 million francs.\nNiersbach added that he \"was not aware of this process in January 2002\".\nA few years later, said the German football chief, the sum reappeared on its accounts as it had to be repaid to Louis-Dreyfus.\nNiersbach said he had been aware of the issue since June, and apologised for not having informed other board members earlier.\nGerman news weekly Spiegel had claimed in a report last week that the German bidding committee had accepted a 10.3 million Swiss francs (6.7 million euros at that time) loan from Louis-Dreyfus.\nSpiegel claims the loan was used to buy the votes of four Asian members of FIFA's 24-strong executive committee.\nAt the vote in July 2000 Germany saw off South Africa by 12 votes to 11 -- Charles Dempsey of New Zealand abstained -- to win the right to hold the 2006 World Cup, with South Africa going on to stage the 2010 edition.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:19:43.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
