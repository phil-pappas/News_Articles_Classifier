But that's not easy to do when the team has traded its facility at One Bills Drive for a 300-acre property in the countryside of England that used to house royalty. \nYes, the Bills are more than 3,500 miles from home in Hertfordshire, England, but they haven't been able to complain about the accommodations at The Grove, located roughly 45 minutes outside of downtown London. The hotel, which is just 11 years old, used to be a mansion that the Earl of Clarendon lived in. It has a professional golf course that will host the British Masters in 2016, a five-star spa and numerous tea rooms and upscale restaurants. That's a bit nicer than the Bills' usual stops on the road. \n\"It's a lot nicer,\" Bills linebacker Nigel Bradham said with a laugh. \"This is king living in London.\" \nThe Bills needed extra accommodations considering they landed in London on Monday morning. That's what made The Grove the easy choice. The England national soccer team used the grounds to train, so there's already a practice field right on the grounds. \n\"This facility right here at The Grove has been absolutely tremendous for us,\" Rex Ryan said. \"The people, I mean it is that type of first-rate hotel and everything else. But I love the location, as far as we are going to try and make it as normal as a week as possible with traveling across the country. With the setups of the meetings, the practice, the grass practice field, all that type of stuff, we feel pretty good about it.\" \nWhy wouldn't they? The hotel was constructed by the same architects that included the Surveyor of King's Works, who oversee the building of royal castles and residencies. The Bills' section of the hotel is complete with team meeting rooms and a cafeteria that closely replicates what the Bills have back home. There's even a full weight room on site. \nHowever, there are no showers in the locker room, and Boobie Dixon has had some trouble controlling the heat in his room. \n\"There's some little things that are a little tough, but we're making the most of it,\" center Eric Wood said. \"They've done a great job preparing this trip for us.\" \nNobody would say exactly what the hotel costs, but given everything that's on-site, it's obviously not cheap. In fact, the hotel has room to accommodate 10 helicopters at once if that gives you an idea of the clientele the facility attracts. The hotel has hosted WGC-American Express Championship, the G20 London summit and the 2013 Bilderberg Conference. In other words, important people stay here. \nSome Bills players haven't even felt the need to leave the grounds. \n\"It's unbelievable,\" tight end Charles Clay said. \"They were just showing me the golf course, and I'm thinking I have to start playing golf now. It's been unbelievable. I haven't been in the city much, but I don't have to go too far. I feel like they have everything right here.\" \nIf the Bills can't pull of a win in London, their travel arrangements won't be the reason why.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:18:21.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
