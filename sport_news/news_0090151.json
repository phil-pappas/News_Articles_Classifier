After straightforward wins in their first two matches against Romania and Canada, Ireland's remaining Pool D fixtures are distinctly tougher. First they take on fellow Six Nations foes Italy on Sunday (October 4) at the Olympic stadium in London, then they face France in a week's time. Should Ireland win both matches they will avoid a potential quarter final with defending champions New Zealand. But if they slip up they will have to face the All Blacks - or even worse, find themselves on the plane home. \"Every game is a real tight game, every game has been a real tight game and it has built the excitement levels,\" O'Connell told reporters at a pre match news conference for the Italy match on Saturday. \"I can't remember a World Cup before where as a team or as a group where we have sat around on couches and watched the games and that has built the excitement. It is the third week in it for us now and definitely there is a feeling of knockout rugby for us this week and opponents we are really familiar with and they are really familiar with us.\" Although Italy will start as underdogs, they did beat Ireland in the Six Nations two years ago - one of just four victories they have had over the men from the Emerald Isle against 20 defeats.
