The puck was moving at about one-quarter speed and Eriksson, a few feet to the left of the net, re-directed the puck and sent it fluttering past Price.\nMeanwhile, though, Patrice Bergeron was battling just outside the blue paint with Habs defenseman Alexei Emelin — battling fiercely to maintain his position at the edge of the crease, but also to avoid contact with Price. There was minimal contact by Bergeron on the goalie but only because the B’s center, despite his best effort, was shoved into Price by Emelin.\nThe goal was immediately waved off by referee Mark Lemelin and Julien wasted little time challenging the call. After a long delay — and does anyone else think it’s crazy that the same refs who make the call on the ice get to decide on the review? — the no-goal call stood.\n“I was surprised,” said Bergeron of the ruling. “I guess he thought that I pushed into the goalie. On the replay, I thought it was clear that I got pushed into him. My understanding was that if I get pushed into the goalie, and I’m working hard to get out of there, it’s fine.\n“But at the same time, it’s kind of a gray area. Sometimes if I touch the goalie they can call that, wave it off. They have to make a decision. They kept their call on the ice. We have to respect that.”\nIt is a gray area, in that it’s a call that might be made one night with one referee, and not the next with a different striped shirt. Rule 69-1 of the NHL rulebook is clear:\n“If an attacking player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending player so as to cause him to come into contact with the goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking player for purposes of this rule, provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.”\nJulien had a fairly reserved response to the call.\n“I’m disappointed,” he said. “But I think what people are going to realize in those kind of things is that on a lot of occasions we’re going to agree to disagree. That was the case.\n“I really felt Bergy … first of all, both his feet are outside the crease area. He got the inside position and then I felt that he was being pushed into their goaltender — and even made that effort to get out.\n“I saw Carey Price sort of back off, looking for the puck, with Bergy not even touching him at the point when the puck went in. I don’t know what their reasoning is; they didn’t take the time to explain. But I really thought we had ourselves a goal there.\n“I looked at it in between periods, and I said, ‘How can that not be a goal when the guy has both feet outside the blue paint and is doing everything he can to stay out of his way, and is really trying to fight off the guy trying to push him in?’ So, I thought that warranted, obviously, a goal. But for some reason they saw it some other way.”\nBergeron acknowledged the goal could have changed the game.\n“It’s 2-1 if it counts, so yeah, it would have been a good momentum turn in our favor,” said Bergeron. “But it didn’t happen, so we can’t hang our heads and feel sorry for ourselves. That goal gets disallowed, and the next shift you get scored on. It definitely hurts. But again, it’s from our own doing, we have to realize that. Don’t put the blame on the refs.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:21:24.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
