If there's a winner from the giant's pain - it's online retailer Amazon ( AMZN ).\nShares of Walmart fell 10% to $60.03 on the news that growth the next three years would be an anemic 3% to 4% and profit would drop up to 12% in fiscal 2017. Shares of Walmart are now down a crushing 30% this year. Investors have seen $21.5 billion in market value vanish just today and $83 billion this year.\nUSA TODAY\nWalmart's biggest owners lose $14.7B in a day!\nUSA TODAY\nWalmart plunges on lower earnings forecast\nInvestors looking for a reason for the nation's biggest retailers don't have to click too far: Amazon. Shares of Amazon have been one of the top performers this year - soaring 75.7%. No, that's not a typo. The online retailer's shares are enjoying a massive rally while the Standard & Poor's 500 is down 2.9% this year.\nWalmart shares are practically a mirror image of Amazon.com's (Photo: USAT)\nPutting the numbers behind this rally really show how Amazon is eating Walmart's lunch. After creating $109.7 billion in shareholder wealth this year, Amazon is worth $254.8 billion. That exceeds the market value of Walmart by 30%.\nAmazon's pulling ahead isn't about the third quarter. Granted, Walmart's adjusted profit in the third quarter is seen dropping nearly 14% -- but Amazon is expected to post a loss of 15 cents a share.\nIt's about the future. The very different trajectories of the two companies are much more about what's expected to happen. Analysts are calling for Amazon.com's adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2016 to jump 211% on 19.8% higher revenue, says S&P Capital IQ. Compare that with the slow-growth future of Walmart. Analysts see fiscal 2016 earnings dropping 11% on revenue that's basically flat-line.\nInvestors are willing to pay up more for Amazon's earnings, as they see it as a faster-growing model even though it loses money while Walmart is profitable. Amazon trades for 31 times its tangible book value, which is the value of hard assets is owns minus what is owes. Walmart, on the other than, trades for just 3.5 times tangible book value.\nThe end result is that after its 18 years - Amazon is now more valuable than Walmart.\nWalmart will still be more than four times bigger than Amazon in terms of revenue. Revenue at Walmart is expected to hit $482.2 billion in fiscal 2015 - while Amazon's is seen to be $105.80 billion.\nIt took 18 years, but Amazon is now more valuable than Walmart (Photo: Bespoke Investment Group)\nBut this is a case where bigger isn't necessarily better.\nAMAZON VS.
