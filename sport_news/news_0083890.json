Then, they'll only have a week of practice between them and a difficult start to the season. \nJoe Johnson, the Nets' most veteran member, knows the final two preseason games are important; the Nets host Philadelphia today (1 p.m., YES) and play at Boston on Monday night. \n\"We've got to get some chemistry on both ends of the floor. That's the main thing,\" Johnson said. \"At this point, obviously, this preseason we've been hit with a bit of an injury bug, but it's part of the game, man, it happens. But we've got to try to develop some type of chemistry, offensively and defensively.\" \nThe Nets won't be able to count on building that chemistry with Andrea Bargnani anytime soon. The veteran big man, who turns 30 later this month, missed Saturday's practice with a hamstring injury. It seems to be a setback for Bargnani, who practiced fully earlier in the week and went through the non-contact parts of Friday's practice. \nThe injury struck Bargnani after training camp; the Nets classified it as a \"tight hamstring.\" On Oct. 5, he said \"I'm good. I'll be back very soon.\" He has yet to play in a preseason game. \nThomas Robinson (wrist), Donald Sloan (hamstring), Rondae-Hollis Jefferson (ankle) and Markel Brown (oblique) have all missed games this preseason. Center Willie Reed had thumb surgery on Friday that will keep him out for 6-8 weeks. \nThe rash of injuries have prevented coach Lionel Hollins from getting a good look at the different combinations the Nets might use. \n\"I don't think Coach has got the rotations how he'd like,\" Johnson said of Hollins. \"It's tough, man, it's tough right now. So we've just got to learn on the fly and when those guys [play], we've got to help them out as much as possible.\" \nThe injury bug has led to a lack of chemistry, and it's concerning to Johnson, the team's oldest and most experienced player. Johnson thinks the Nets' young, fresh faces will be able to figure out how to score. \n\"It's not that much of a big deal; offense will come,\" Johnson said. \"We'll make shots. We've got to be aggressive and make plays, not just settling for jumpers.\" \nBut when mentioning the defense, which has been discombobulated and ineffective throughout the preseason, Johnson sighed deeply — like a man who knows there is much work to be done. Johnson said that Hollins \"got on\" the team in a film session regarding Wednesday's loss to Boston. \n\"We've got to do a better job of helping one another,\" Johnson said. We've got some things to clean up.\" \nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:14:03.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
