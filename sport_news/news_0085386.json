Although the Lady Dragons came up short in both sets, head coach Jessica Hager said the girls had some good volleys and were playing smart but just had trouble keeping the ball on their side. “The girls continue to improve and are gaining a lot more knowledge of the game through these competitive matches,”Hager said. Aubrey Scott led the Lady Dragons in the loss with two attacks, one block, one ace and one dig. Lauren Wieland had two attacks and one dig while Rachel Lenz added one attack, one ace and one dig, Morgan Wieland with one attack and two aces, Jenna Kahle with two aces and Skyler Shuffield with one ace and one dig. In the JV match, Sweet Springs defeated Bunceton by the scores of 18-25 and 12-25. Autumn Bishop had one attack, one kill and one dig for the Lady Dragons while Taylor Burnett added one dig and Katelyn Showman with one ace. The Bunceton Lady Dragons volleyball team will play next on Saturday, Oct. 17th in the Calvary Lutheran Tournament.
