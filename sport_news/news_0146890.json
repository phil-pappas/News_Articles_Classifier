LOUIS — John Lackey is the best bargain in baseball, and he gives the Cardinals a pitching backbone.\nLackey, who is making $507,500 this season, will go against old friend Jon Lester on Friday at Busch Stadium in Game 1 of the NLDS against the Cubs. He’s been around the block on rivalries, so he is the perfect candidate to start for the injury-riddled Cardinals.\n“It’s obviously special,’’ Lackey said of this rivalry. “I mean, you can tell the importance of it and the way people feel about throughout the Midwest for sure. I’ve done the Yankees-Red Sox thing. I’ve done the Dodgers-Angels thing out there. I’ve seen a couple of big ones. So I think I’ll be OK.’’\nLackey is going in with eyes wide open.\n“Going to be a challenge,’’ he said. “Great team. Really good lineup. Obviously pretty familiar with each other, you know being in the same division. So yeah, it’s going to be a tough one.’’\nLackey will match up against Lester, two former Red Sox who have found new life with new teams in a different league.\n“That’s my boy, yeah,’’ Lackey said, “he’s good. No accident people running into each other this time of year.’’\nLackey is focusing his energy on the inside fastball.\n“I don’t really want to get into any locations. I mean that’s — I need both sides of the plate too,’’ he said. “This lineup is too good of a lineup to attack one place. I’m definitely going to have to be all over the place, changing speeds and hope for the best.’’\nAsked about his friendship with Lester, Lackey said they have similar likes.\n“Country stuff,’’ he said. “Country music, hunting, trucks, you know, stuff like that.’’\nNoted Lester: “This is awesome It’s not too often you get to be in a situation like this to go against one of your better friends. He’s such a good competitor.’’\nLester pointed to the essence of Lackey’s success — a good lesson for all young pitchers as Lackey has emerged as the leader of this staff because of Adam Wainwright’s woes.\n“He’s going to almost out-will you at times,’’ Lester said of Lackey. “If that makes sense. I learned a lot from him in Boston. Our friendship will go beyond this game, goes beyond our careers. Come [Friday], we’re not buddies anymore.’’\nNot too far in the future, though, these two buddies will be sitting on the back of a truck after a day of hunting, listening to country music and talking about the time they went head-to-head in the NLDS.\n  chicago cubs ,  john lackey ,  jon lester ,  st. louis cardinals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:21:23.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
