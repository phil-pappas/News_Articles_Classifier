No. 1 team in the state. Good quarterback, good running back, solid defense, and that’s basically it,” said Valencia running back Effie Davalos. \nLast year when these teams played at Valencia High School, Centennial pulled away gradually in a 72-42 win. \nThis time around, it was much quicker. \nThe Huskies (5-0) scored on a 50-yard wheel route from Anthony Catalano to J.J. Taylor on the second play of the game, and it didn’t take many more plays to keep the touchdown train rolling. \nThe Huskies found the end zone on each of their first seven possessions, stopped only by the halftime whistle. \nIn just a quarter and a half of play, Catalano completed 6-of-7 passes for 210 yards and four touchdowns, while also running for 39 yards and a score. He was replaced by a reserve midway through the second quarter.\"I thought he was sharp, and that was what you wanted to see. Coming out of a bye week, you want to be sharp,\" said Centennial head coach Matt Logan of the quarterback. \nCatalano’s four scores were each thrown to different targets: the 50-yarder to Taylor, 51 yards to Chacho Ulloa, 29 yards to Troy Spencer Jr., and 42 yards to Xavier Marshall. \nThat all made for a 52-0 Huskies lead at halftime and a running clock from that point forward. \nValencia (2-3) tried to play ball-control offense, but that was made difficult with two lost fumbles and an interception in the first half. \nDavalos plunged into the end zone from 2 yards out with 5:19 to play for Valencia’s only score. He finished with 64 yards on 16 rushes. \nQuarterback Cole Parkinson did what he could to evade pressure and make some plays in the air and with his feet, but the Huskies got to him for four first-half sacks including a safety. \nHe finished the game 14-of-18 for 137 yards and one interception. \nThe Vikings open league play at home against Golden Valley next week. \n“You kind of measure where you’re at and you’re still going to see a lot of weaknesses and those are the things you’ve got to still work to push on as you hit league,” said Valencia head coach Larry Muir.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:44:05.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
