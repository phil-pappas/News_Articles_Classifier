Kate Brown announced in a statement Wednesday.\nGov. John Kitzhaber appointed Kohl, a former city attorney, to the Washington County bench in 1997. His Dec. 31 retirement comes about a year before his current term expires.\nDuring his tenure, Kohl has previously served as presiding judge, and in 2005 he launched the county's Drug Court program, which offers treatment and reduced sentenced for selected chronic drug offenders. He continues to preside over drug court.\nKohl's 21-year-old daughter was fatally stabbed in a murder-for-hire plot in 2006. Her killer, Robert Bettelyoun , was convicted of aggravated murder in 2009 and is serving life in prison without parole.\nKohl has written a book and speaks to audiences in prisons and churches about his transformative experience with faith, and how it enabled him to forgive his daughter's killer.\nIn September, Kohl said he had stopped performing wedding ceremonies as a judge after a federal judge overturned the state's gay marriage ban last year.\n\"Last summer for personal faith-based reasons, I decided to not perform weddings as a judge,\" he said.\nHe declined to answer questions about the decision, saying, \"This is a personal choice based on my faith.\"\nGov. Brown, in a statement Wednesday, thanked Kohl for his service. She is accepting applications to fill his position. Interest forms are due Nov. 9.\n-- Emily E.
