Booker picked up a technical foul and Hibbert raced over to defend his teammate, bouncing Booker with his chest in the process. Booker swung at Hibbert's head.\n  The feud between Booker and Hibbert seemed to start earlier in the week, with the two exchanging words in Sunday's preseason opener. After that game, Booker declined to elaborate on the issue by saying, \"I don't even want to talk about him. No words for him.\"\nAfter Tuesday's game, Booker had even less to say. The veteran forward declined to speak with reporters at all.\nHibbert didn't have much to add, either.\n\"We play together. I'm not going to speak too much about that play,\" Hibbert told reporters in the locker room after the game. \"Like I said, [Randle is] the face of this team for the future and, one through 15, I'd step up for anybody, anybody in the starting five to the guys at the end of the bench. We play as a team and I have everybody's back.\"\nImmediately after the game, Jazz coach Quin Snyder said he had yet to talk with his forward about the scuffle.\n\"We'll look at the tape and everything,\" Snyder said. \"Obviously, we want him in the game and we've got to try to control our emotions, and Trevor's an emotional guy.\"\n\nLoud and proud\nMost of the 10,300 fans who filled the Stan Sheriff Center on the University of Hawaii campus for Utah's first two preseason games were there to cheer on Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers.\nNot that the Jazz minded at all.\n\"It was unbelievable,\" Snyder said. \"It was great. It was a road game, it felt like, for us. It wasn't a typical preseason game, that's for sure. I think both teams got a lot out of it.\"\nNew Jazz center Tibor Pleiss had been told to expect a more subdued start to his NBA career. Instead, he got just the opposite.\n\"Everybody's saying the preseason is not so much defense,\" he said. \"But it was so intense. Everybody was hustling. Everybody was hacking each other. People were fighting. It was unbelievable.\"\n\nFeeling fresh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:08:05.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
