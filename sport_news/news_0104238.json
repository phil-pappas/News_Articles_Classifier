I always did and always will. \n\"The first few years I had a mixed reception (at City) because of the circumstances (under which) I left the club. My dad always said if they boo you they love you. \n\"It is a big game for us because we play against a team that will possibly win the title but for us it's just a Premier League game.\" \nDistin will likely continue in central defence for Bournemouth after club captain Tommy Elphick was ruled out for eight weeks following surgery on an ankle injury. \nCity are without the injured Sergio Aguero and David Silva, perhaps the two finest players in their exceptional squad, but Distin does not believe that their collective absence makes Bournemouth's visit to the Etihad any easier. \n\"You can look at it thinking it will be easier but the truth is it won't,\" he said. \n\"They have a really good bench and no matter what it will be a tough game. \n\"If we start believing without those two it will be a comfortable afternoon we will be wrong.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:09:43.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
