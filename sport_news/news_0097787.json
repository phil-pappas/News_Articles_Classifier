Just stop it. \nPut away your polls and forget your debates. \nIt's a fun subject to discuss, but The Kick Six has not been eclipsed by The Kick Sux. Recency does not equal supremacy. \nThe Kick Six, you know. If you're an Auburn fan, you'll always remember where you were when Chris Davis took a missed field goal 109 yards to the house on the final play to win the 2013 Iron Bowl. If you're an Alabama fan, no matter how hard you try, you'll never be able to forget it. \nThe Kick Sux is my name for Saturday's unbelievable ending of Michigan State 27, Michigan 23. Needing only to get off a punt on the final play to give Jim Harbaugh his first signature win in Ann Arbor, Michigan's Blake O'Neill dropped the snap, tried to kick the ball anyway under heavy duress and his feeble sideways effort landed in the hands of Michigan State's Jalen Watts-Jackson, who ran it back 38 yards for the winning touchdown as time expired. \nThe phantasmagorical nature of the ending immediately conjured comparisons, with some commentators suggesting The Kick Sux trumped The Kick Six. \nPerish the thought. â€” Dr. Saturday (@YahooDrSaturday) October 17, 2015 \nIt's true that, if Davis had stepped out of bounds or been tackled or otherwise failed to score, the 2013 Iron Bowl would've gone to overtime. If Michigan State hadn't scored on that botched punt, Michigan would've won the game. \nThat's the only factor in favor of The Kick Sux. \nIn terms of historical significance, The Kick Six has no peer. It was the first time in college football history a missed field goal return for a touchdown had decided a game on the final play. And it wasn't just any game. It was the Mother of All Iron Bowls, the biggest game in the history of the rivalry with both teams in the hunt for the SEC and national titles up to the moment Davis crossed the goal line. \nThat play ended Alabama's quest for a three-peat of national championships and launched Auburn toward the SEC title and the BCS Championship Game. \nThe play Saturday doesn't necessarily eliminate Michigan from Big Ten championship consideration and doesn't guarantee Michigan State as much as a division title. \nFor all those reasons, The Kick Six remains the king of all college football endings. \nThat's my take.
