Kortney Hause of Wolverhampton Wanderers and David Nugent of Middlesbrough. \nIn front of the biggest home crowd of the season of 22,008, there was a good atmosphere at Molineux with Boro also well-backed by a size-able travelling support. \nBenik Afobe, playing in a lone frontman role with Edwards behind him, got Wolves' first shhot away after wriggling clear of Daniel Ayala, but it was well wide of Dimi Konstantopoulos' goal. \nChelsea loanee Tomas Kalas tested Emiliano Martinez' reflexes with a stunning effort 12 minutes in, with the Argentine keeper finger-tipping the rasping 20-yarder over the bar. \nByrne, making just his second start for the club, then created a chance by himself, nicking the ball off Fernando Amorebieta by the byline and cutting inside before shooting in the side netting from a tight angle. \nThe game was beginning to open up with both sides finding pockets of room in and around the respective defences. It was Edwards who found plenty of room to head Wolves in front on 22 minutes. \nKevin McDonald set the move off, finding the overlapping Golbourne down the left with a peach of a pass. \nThe left-back responded with a perfect cross towards the six-yard box where Edwards sent a diving header into the net. \nA clearly confident Edwards, who had missed Wolves' last two matches with a groin injury, tried his luck with a spectacular 20-yard volley that wasn't too far over the bar. \nConor Coady was then booked for pulling back Emilio Nsue as Boro looked to attack. \nJust minutes later, the midfielder was extremely fortunate not to be sent off. He crashed through Kalas with a late tackle but, surprisingly, referee James Linington instead gave Coady a final warning. \nThe wincing challenge could have been worthy of a red card on its own, and Coady could count himself fortunate not to earn his second red card of the season. \nCoady then saw a low shot deflected wide after more good build-up play from Wolves, which had been a feature of their first-half performance. \nReferee Linington was replaced by fourth official Darren Drysdale at half time, leading to the second-half kicking off five minutes late. \nMr Drysdale 's yellow card was needed almost immediately when Wolves old-boy Friend scythed through Matt Doherty and was deservedly booked. \nWolves were dealt a blow when Hause then went down with what looked like a hamstring strain. After treatment he was stretchered off, clearly in some distress. \nThe injury was the last thing Jackett wanted, with Wolves already desperately shot of cover at the back. He sent on Jack Price in Hause's place with Coady moving to centre-half. \nSome rash challenges from Boro had the home fans up in arms, with Fabbrini and Fernando Amorebieta booked within a few minutes of each other.
