The approach isn’t that much different. You know you can shoot corners a little bit more, go off the plate a bit more because it is an aggressive team.\nQ: Was it a matter of the Cardinals just making too many mistakes in the NLDS? \nA: If you locate well — and picture them going against the Mets or the Dodgers — they have a pretty good chance of silencing those bats. Generally, big swing-and-miss teams, you can shut them down with good pitching in the postseason. We didn’t see that with the Cardinals, but they are a different team than the one we saw in the beginning of the season, especially from a starting-rotation standpoint.\nCJ Nitkowski Photo: Fox Sports Q: Who is the favorite in the ALCS? \nA: I don’t think there’s a clear favorite. There’s not one thing to separate: Each team has a strength, each team has a couple of question marks. You can look at both the acquired aces in Johnny Cueto (Royals) and David Price (Blue Jays) as guys who have fallen a little short of expectations. Cueto was great in Game 5 against the Astros, but other than that he’s been a disappointment. Price has been solid in the regular season, but hasn’t really shown up in the postseason, yet. Which one of those guys will be better will have a huge impact on this series.\nQ: Why has Price struggled in the postseason? \nA: He’s made some mistakes and he admitted after his first start against the Rangers that he was a little nervous, which surprised me a little bit. It’s kind of hard to believe that he’s been overtaken by the moment and that’s why it hasn’t happened for him, yet. But I think his time is coming. He’s too good of a pitcher to not have success in the postseason. I thought he would do better in Game 1. It appears the Blue Jays liked [Marcus] Stroman a little bit better and planned in that way so he’d start in Game 5 (vs. Rangers), which I found pretty interesting.\nQ: Did the Jose Bautista bat flip bother you? \nA: That’s a non-issue for me. We really have a tendency to blow these things out of proportion . Right after the game, it’s emotional and there’s a lot going on. I understand the frustration and people should understand that’s not really a great question to ask after someone just got eliminated from the series. The timing is not right to address the issue.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  david price ,  johnny cueto ,  jose bautista ,  kansas city royals ,  mlb playoffs ,  st. louis cardinals ,  toronto blue jays", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:13:23.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
