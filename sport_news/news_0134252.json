Even before the trade deadline makeover, the Jays had an amazing sense of amnesia when it came to turning the page, a team that has believed in itself every step of the way, even when others doubted them. \nEven in the depths of his own personal despair, Ryan Goins, whose seventh-inning misplay opened the door just a crack for the Royals to flood through it in Game 2, was girding himself for the next round in this heavyweight fight. \n“We’re a resilient group of guys, we always battle, we grind, we fight,” said Goins. “We’re all grinders in here. We all come to work every day.” \nAs much as Goins was ready to wear the Game 2 loss as his own, he had plenty of company. When he failed to make the play on Ben Zobrist’s very catchable pop-up in right field to lead off the seventh, it put a runner on first with nobody out. \nIt is a very long stretch from none-out, one-on to a six-hit, five-run inning, especially with David Price pitching one of the best games of his life. Through six innings, Price had allowed a first-inning leadoff single to Alcides Escobar, then nothing else. The Royals had gone 18 up, 18 down with maybe one or two bits of solid contact through those first six innings. Price was at 66 pitches when he began the seventh, without even a hint that anything had changed. \nLikewise, the Blue Jays had been negligent with runners in scoring position and should have been leading 5-0 or 6-0 at the dawn of the seventh. \nOn the day, Toronto was 3-for-16 with runners in scoring position, which tells you how many great scoring opportunities were left uncashed. Their inability to put Yordano Ventura away would end up being as much to blame for the loss as their seventh-inning meltdown. \nSo, here we are. Just as the Jays blew the first two games against the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series, so have they done to start the ALCS. \n“You don’t like to get in the habit of doing it, that’s for sure,” said Gibbons. “Our back is against the wall, but it will be good to go back home where we normally play well. We’ll have (Marcus Stroman) going on Monday. We feel good. It’s a lot tougher from here. But we have a pretty good team, too.” \nThey are down two, coming home this time, which might make the odds a trifle shorter but, really, what’s the difference? They have to win four out of five. Against Texas, they had to win three in a row. Some math whiz can likely compute the relative probabilities. We’ll settle for saying it’s a tall order. \nThe solution, of course, is just to win until somebody taps you on the shoulder and says it’s over. \n“Well, you’ve got to get a win under your belt and that will go a long way,” said Gibbons after Game 2. “We’re capable of that. We’re at home. That’s where you’ve got to win. It won’t be easy, no doubt about that. But we get one win out of the way, that can turn things in a hurry.” \nTo that end, the Jays will send out Stroman and R.A. Dickey in Games 3 and 4. Stroman is ready, willing and able to take the ball in what has to be considered a must-win situation on Monday night. \nSo far, in his unexpected return to the mound after tearing up his ACL in spring training, Stroman has been money. He’s 4-0 in his four starts and in his last three. He has pitched 22 innings, allowing two earned runs. \nThe only time the Royals have faced Stroman was in his very first major-league start on May 31, 2014, when he logged six innings, allowing a run on six hits in a 12-2 Toronto victory. Stroman, and the Royals, have come a long way since his debut. \nIn his only start against the Royals this year, Dickey shut them out on two hits over seven innings on the way to a 5-2 Toronto victory. That came in the final game of that four-game series early in August when the Jays won three out of four. In the one game they didn’t win in that series, Mark Lowe made his inauspicious Jays entrance and the Royals overcame a one-run Toronto lead with three in the eighth inning on the way to a 7-6 Kansas City win. \nAt their best this year, the Jays were both a home run-hitting behemoth and a team that could manufacture runs. So far in the playoffs they have been stuck in the former mode. \nThey’re hitting .222 as a team in the postseason but have produced the majority of their runs via the long ball, with eight homers. However they do it, they have to become more productive with the bats. \nRight now, Edwin Encarnacion, Chris Colabello and Kevin Pillar have been their best hitters, hitting a combine 26-for-77 (.338) with a homer each and a total of 10 RBI. Jose Bautista and Josh Donaldson have delivered timely hits but both need to step it up at the Rogers Centre because they’re hitting a combined .229. \nThe Royals are nothing if not a predatory bunch. They are like sharks when they smell blood in the water. How else do you explain how, with the door open just a crack against Price, who was pitching a gem, they could smash that door down and come up with a five-run rally? \n“It’s unexplainable,” said Zobrist said, whose routine pup-up that started it all. \n“And, frankly, it’s extremely frustrating when you’re on the other side of it. And when you’re on this side of it, you’re kind of shrugging your shoulders like, ‘OK. Great. Awesome. Thank you.’” \nAt home, the Blue Jays hope to return the favour. \nAnd nobody will get a “You’re welcome” no matter how it plays out.
