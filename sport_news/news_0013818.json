Henson noted he was trying to make a purchase during regular business hours. \nA few moments later, Henson said a pair of police cars pulled up and watched him from a distance for about five minutes. He said he suspected the store had called the cops on him. \nHenson said two officers then questioned him about his car, which he said he drives as part of an endorsement deal with a local Chevrolet and Cadillac dealership.

Several hours after Henson posted about the incident, the jewelry store deleted its Facebook profile , and locked down both its Twitter and Instagram accounts. \nWhitefish Bay Police Chief Michael Young did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the incident. \nEarlier this month the Bucks signed Henson to a four-year, $44 million extension that could increase to $48 million with incentives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:57:09.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
