He has been the White Sox announcer from 1982-1985 and then again from 1990-currently. In his nine-season MLB career, Harrelson was a .239 hitter with 131 home runs and 421 RBI in 900 games. Colleen Kane Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune What are some reasons Ken 'Hawk' Harrelson plans to cut back on his 2016 TV schedule? \nWhite Sox TV play-by-play announcer Ken “Hawk” Harrelson confirmed Monday that he plans to cut back on his 2016 schedule. \nHarrelson, who has been in the Sox TV booth for 31 seasons, said by phone he didn’t want to give further information because the deal hadn’t been finalized and he wanted to wait for the team to provide details. \nBruce Levine of WSCR-AM 670 reported that Harrelson will only work road games, along with a limited slate of home games, including opening day and the Cubs series at U.S. Cellular Field. \nHarrelson, 74, commutes from his home in Granger, Ind., to Sox home games, approximately 100 miles one way, and he said that is among the reasons he would cut back. He said spending more time with his family also is a factor. \nHarrelson originally said he was going to cut back on broadcasts last season before working an almost full schedule. He is a two-time finalist for the Ford C. Frick Award, given to broadcasters for major contributions to baseball. \nA Sox spokesman said the club is not yet ready to announce their broadcasters for the 2016 season. Ed Farmer and Darrin Jackson are expected back in the Sox radio booth as broadcasts move to WLS-AM 890 next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:30:18.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
