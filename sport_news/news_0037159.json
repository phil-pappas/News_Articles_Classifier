The start of a new NHL season is usually a time when rookies prove their worth and fight to keep a spot on the roster. However, this year it may also be a period where some coaches fight to keep their jobs. We are only a few games into the 2015-2016 NHL season, but a few coaches have already found themselves in the hot seat.\nAdChoices Coaching is not an easy feat: when a team is winning the players are praised profusely, but when things start to turn sour all fingers immediately point to the head coach. It's no wonder that struggling teams change coaches every few seasons. Questions are already floating around concerning which coaches could be on the chopping block next.\nLet's take a look at some NHL coaches who are already on thin ice:\nClaude Julien - Boston Bruins\n© Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports Boston Bruins head coach Claude Julien looks on from the bench during the final moments of the third period of the Tampa Bay Lightning's 6-3 win over the Boston Bruins at TD Garden. The season is barely underway and the Boston Bruins are already off to a noticeably rough start. The Bruins are 1-3-0 so far, and a majority of the blame for their lackluster performance is falling on head coach Claude Julien.\nAlthough Julien has an impressive track record since joining the Bruins in 2007, last season's disappointing end is still fresh in the mind of Bruins management. Julien led the Bruins to a Stanley Cup in 2011 and to an Eastern Conference Championship in 2013, but recently Boston's performance has been on a steady decline. Last season the Bruins missed qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since Julien's first year.\nOver the past year the Bruins have made some big changes to the roster as well as the front office, but Boston's coaching staff has remained untouched — at least for now. Julien's performance has been under scrutiny in the past, but the team has always been able to rally a few wins and take the pressure off; however, judging by the Bruins rocky start, that might not be the case this season. The Bruins lost a few key pieces over the offseason, including Dougie Hamilton and Milan Lucic, and didn't get the high caliber players they so desperately needed in return. Add in the rest of the Bruins' aging roster, and this season could spell disaster for Julien.\nDarryl Sutter - Los Angeles Kings\n© Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images Kings Head Coach Darryl Sutter coaches from the bench while Trevor Lewis #22 of the Los Angeles Kings, Kyle Clifford #13 of the Los Angeles Kings, and Marian Gaborik #12 of the Los Angeles Kings look on. at Staples Center on October 7, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. Winning the Stanley Cup twice over the course of four years is an incredible feat, but the heightened expectations that come with this level of success can be tough on any coach, even Darryl Sutter. Sutter won two cups with Kings in 2012 and 2014, but in 2015 the Kings were the first Stanley Cup Championship team to miss the playoffs since the Carolina Hurricanes in 2007.\nSutter and the Kings have opened up the 2015-2016 season in disappointing fashion, being outscored 12-2 in their first three games. The Kings have yet to earn a win, and all eyes are turning to Sutter for answers. The bottom line for the Kings is that they've lost the depth and defensive prowess that made them two-time Stanley Cup Champions. Scoring only two goals in their first three games isn't necessarily a death sentence for the struggling team, but if the team falls apart in the same dramatic fashion as last season, Sutter could soon be looking for a new job.\nLindy Ruff - Dallas Stars\n© AP Photo/Joel Auerbach Stars head coach Lindy Ruff directs the players during a time out against the Florida Panthers during the third period of an NHL preseason hockey game, Tuesday, Sept. 22, 2015, in Sunrise, Fla. The Panthers defeated the Stars 3-2. Out of all of the NHL coaches, Lindy Ruff could possibly have the most erratic career coaching record; jumping from round to round of the playoffs, and even missing the postseason altogether, in the span of a few seasons. After being fired from the Buffalo Sabres in 2013, Ruff quickly made himself at home in Texas with a four-year contract as head coach of the Dallas Stars.\nRuff's situation is a little better than Julien's or Sutter's. So far the Stars are off to a 3-1-0 start this season; a much better start than that of the Bruins or Kings. But because the Stars missed last season's playoffs after such a strong start, every single mistake on the ice and every loss on their record will be magnified this season. The franchise is looking to put their five-season playoff drought behind them, and any indication that the Stars will miss the playoffs again this year will cause alarm in the front office.\nThe Stars made a lot of big roster changes over the offseason, adding big name players like Patrick Sharp and Johnny Oduya. Add in existing players like Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn, and the team is starting the season off with great potential. But that's where the concern about Ruff comes into play. The Stars, without a doubt, have the right level of talent to be playoff contenders, but if the team ultimately falls short this season, the blame will fall directly on Ruff's shoulders. The talent is definitely there, but the right coach may not be.\nIf the Stars can't hold pace throughout the entire season, Ruff might not make it to the end of his contract.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://thesportsquotient.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:56:45.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
