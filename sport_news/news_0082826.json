Whenever the Blue Jays or Raptors make it into the playoffs, the media from opposition cities in the U.S. start spewing tongue-in-cheek columns about how things in Canada are different and how Canadians do things in funny and unique ways.\nYou know, Canadians wear toques and say “eh” and cute things like that. For whatever reason, the American media feels it must remind its fellow citizens whenever the Raptors or Jays qualify for the post-season that there is actually another country in North America besides the U.S. and Mexico.\nAnd the only reason Americans are aware of Mexico is because Donald Trump keeps warning them that the Mexicans are massing at the border and are coming to steal their cars.\nThe latest example came this week in the Royalsreview.com website, under the subtitle. “Royals Humor, Satire & Nonsense’,” Tim Webber wrote a piece called “How to play Canadian baseball.” Here are some examples of the hilarity, with a response, appropriate or otherwise:\n“Canada does a lot of things differently. Their football fields are 10 yards longer, presumably because 100 is too round of a number.”\nNo, it’s because 100 yards American is 110 yards Canadian.\n“And to be honest, some of the things that Canada does differently aren’t too bad.”\nGee, thanks. It’s great to know that there is at least one American who understands that life can be worth living if you happen to live outside of the U.S. It’s as though there’s nothing worse then watching an American drop to his knees and break down in tears of joy after he stumbles upon a Burger King while vacationing in Europe.\n“Be prepared for some culture shock if you’re planning to watch the Royals continue the ALCS in Toronto over the next few days.”\nCulture shock? Really? Let me give visiting Americans some advice: Don’t let that bag of ketchup potato chips send you into shock therapy.\n“No one knows for sure when Canadians started baseball; the best guess is that it developed somewhere in the wilderness of northern Manitoba.”\nWho wrote this guy’s material, Ray J. Johnson? Yes, Canadian baseball was developed right after Canuck James Naismith invented basketball on a frozen river in Tuktoyaktuk. Naismith eventually moved to the States because his balls were always freezing. They don’t bounce well when frozen.\n“Like most sports in the Great White North, Canadian baseball is meant to be played on ice, so children flock to local ponds in the winter.”\nOf course, growing up in Canada you’re told that if you “flock to the local pond” too often, you’ll go blind.\n“Canada has its own professional baseball league, which is comprised of nine teams. Four of them are known as the ‘Rough Riders,’ or some variation thereof.”\nI can safely say that I’ve heard this “Every team in Canada is called the Rough Riders” joke on David Letterman, Jay Leno, Johnny Carson, Jack Paar, Steve Allen, The Simpsons, Family Guy ... I think Mark Twain wrote a variation of it in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. It’s a joke that never gets old. Apparently.\n“There are a few changes you’ll notice at the Rogers Centre. Instead of netting behind home plate and fences in the outfield, the entirety of the field is surrounded by glass boards. Any player who hits a foul ball outside of the boards receives a two-minute delay of game penalty and must sit in the penalty box.”\nAnd then a Mountie rides in on a horse and pours a bottle of maple syrup over the guy’s head and Nelson Eddy starts singing Indian Love Call.\n“Canadian baseball bats have a hook at the end, forming a slight ‘L’ shape. The bats are thinner than the American style, and most players tape them to prolong their lifespan.”\nAnd American hockey sticks have an Uzi taped to the shaft. To prolong their lifespan.\n“Each game is divided into three ‘periods’ of three innings each. If the game is still tied after three periods, the teams move on to another period of sudden death, 3-on-3 overtime. If still tied, the winner is decided by a bat-flipping contest.”\nThe actual rule is, if the game is still tied after 3-on-3 overtime, everybody starts beating the s--- out of each other and the last team standing wins. It’s like what the great George Carlin said about hockey: ‘Hockey is not a sport. Hockey is three activities going on at the same time: Ice skating, playing with the puck, and beating the s--- out of somebody.’ Yep, that’s how we do it up here.\n“Full contact, including devastating body checks, are completely legal in Canada. This explains a lot about Brett Lawrie.”\nActually, not a bad line. Sometimes I wish there was body checking in baseball. Of course we spell it “body chequing.”\n“Scoring works exactly the same as in American baseball, except that a solo home run is known as a ‘rouge.’ ”\nWhich is French for “screw you.”\nI’m pretty certain that if the Jays make it into the World Series, we won’t see any more of these columns because people in New York and Chicago are sophisticated and have a pretty good awareness of Canada. In fact, a recent study revealed that 9 out of 10 New Yorkers could find Canada on a map... if it was map of Canada.\nsteve.buffery@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter @beezersun\nGame 3: Blue Jays vs. Royals\n2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.
