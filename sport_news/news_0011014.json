Then I looked over at my wife, one of the biggest Browns fans I know, and she was fast asleep. She had the right idea. Instead of witnessing the 24-6 disappointment, she got some shut eye. \nA better use of time if you ask me. \nThe Browns took major strides in their win against Baltimore and took the Broncos to the brink, but Sunday the Browns took two steps back. \nTurnovers were the theme; four fumbles and a turnover on downs, leading to 17 points for St. Louis, is not the ideal recipe for success. More like a death wish. It was the second week in a row the Browns have been scored on by the opposing defense. It was also the second time in two weeks the Browns turned the football over three or more times. \nCleveland Browns running back Duke Johnson Jr., left, is stopped by St. Louis Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson during the first quarter of an NFL football game Sunday, Oct. 25, 2015, in St. Louis.

The Browns could not seem to hold on to the football and on the third offensive play, a Taylor Gabriel fumble was returned for a score. It was just the start to a miserable offensive day. \nBoth defenses seemed to be lights out, but given the fact the both offenses were a snoozefest of entertainment, it was pretty easy to assume the defenses were that good. The Rams came into the contest with the worst offense in terms of yards, and the Browns gave up 24 points. Sure, the Rams had incredible field position the entire game, thanks to all of the turnovers, making it hard for the Cleveland defense to make stops, but giving up 128 yards to rookie running back Todd Gurley just goes to show that the Cleveland run defense is broken. \nIt was the same old story when you look at quarterback play. I know, I know, McCown has played great as of late with his team record-breaking passing yardage in consecutive games. But look at the only real stat that matters, wins. He is 1-5 as the starting quarterback. At 36, McCown is Pettine’s first choice at quarterback. Pattine has even gone on record stating that the Browns are in a win-now mentality and that is why McCown is starting. \nSorry, but I am not buying it. Now, McCown is hurt and his status for next week is in question. Is it Manziel time for good? A pending investigation into a recent off-field incident could derail those hopes. A hurt McCown and a possible suspension for Manziel could have the Browns looking at a third-string option. Pretty typical luck for the Cleveland faithful. \nTodd Gurley #30 of the St. Louis Rams scores a touchdown in the fourth quarter against the Cleveland Browns at the Edward Jones Dome on October 25, 2015 in St. Louis, Missouri.

They have given up four or more sacks in five games this season, false start penalties have them looking like a junior varsity team and the miscommunications are coming at the worst times. \nA lot of things are broken with the Cleveland Browns. But there are some positives. Gary Barnidge has worked himself into a superstar of a tight end. His 101 yards receiving was tops in the entire game. He provides a very valuable option at receiver regardless of who is quarterback. \nDuke Johnson is going to be an asset for a long time in a Cleveland Browns uniform. Lately he has made most of his noise catching passes out of the backfield. With the Browns focusing more on the passing game. Duke should have a chance to lead all running backs in receiving this season. \nThe Browns host Arizona next week.
