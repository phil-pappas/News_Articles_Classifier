It's a chilly night in Philadelphia, with temperatures in the mid-40s, so there was some concern about Beckham's hamstring handling the weather, but he showed enough Sunday and Monday to play. \nAlso active for the game is wide receiver Rueben Randle , who suffered his own hamstring injury in the Week 5 game but was able to practice during the week. The Giants have their full complement of wide receivers, minus Victor Cruz , who has been out all year with knee and calf injuries. \nOn defense, the Giants are more banged up. Starting cornerback Prince Amukamara (pec) and nickel cornerback Trumaine McBride (groin) are inactive, which means Jayron Hosley is a starting corner while Trevin Wade mans the nickel spot. Defensive end Robert Ayers will miss his fourth straight game with a hamstring injury, and linebacker Devon Kennard is sitting out a second straight game with a hamstring injury of his own. \nGeorge Selvie starts in place of Ayers, and Mark Herzlich starts in place of Kennard. Middle linebacker Jon Beason , who left last week's game with a concussion, will start. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:37:21.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
