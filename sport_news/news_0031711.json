It was a record fourth win in a row for the club.\nShould the team hold that spot come season’s end, it would earn a bye into the second round of the playoffs where the squad would play both a home and away leg.\nThe match was a challenge for the Reds supporting cast, with Bradley missing because of a mild groin injury, and Giovinco and Altidore on the bench following friendlies with their respective international teams.\nWith those three players combining for nearly 70 per cent of the team’s goals this season, it was up to Toronto’s sometimes shaky defence to stay solid against New York’s trademark high press.\nToronto countered well from the beginning, with Jonathan Osorio and Marky Delgado combining on a number of occasions to create opportunities in the box.\nBut good positioning couldn’t make up for poor control in front of net, not even when Delgado was pulled down in the box midway through the half. Referee Fotis Bazakos ignored calls for a penalty from Reds players and a small crowd of fans who gathered while the rest of the city’s eyes were on the Toronto Blue Jays down the street.\nMost of the drama came from the sidelines in the first half, with the Red Bulls quelled by Toronto’s unusually defensive formation as well as Jonathan Osorio and Marky Delgado’s inability to convert from within the box.\nIn a bizarre incident in the 34th minute, Altidore was red carded from the bench for using foul and abusive language during an altercation with Bazakos and his assistants. The striker will miss Saturday’s home game against the Columbus Crew.\nThe half came to a close with neither team getting out of second gear. A draw was enough for both — New York needed only one point to clinch first place in the Eastern Conference — and it showed.\nBut Gomez turned the tide for Toronto a little more than five minutes into the second half, capitalizing on some shocking defending from New York to tip the ball past goalkeeper Luis Robles.\nThe insurance, in the form of another Giovinco goal, came almost half an hour later. The Italian, who played for his national team Tuesday night in Rome, danced through seemingly all of New York’s midfield and defence before rocketing a shot past Robles and into the far corner of the net.\nIt was a second convincing display from the home side, who will now jockey for positioning in the eastern conference. A first- or second-place finish would earn them that bye, while a third- or fourth-place would see Toronto host the conference’s fifth- or sixth-place team at BMO Field in the first round, a single elimination match.\nMore on thestar.com\nAfter nine historic innings, nine fans have a message for the Jays\nALDS Game 5: Blue Jays-Rangers", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:12:54.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
