In his three road games, he’s been booed and taunted. \nAs much as Kane says the rink is his sanctuary, the three-time Stanley Cup winner can’t take the ice without most of those watching thinking about the crime he has been accused of — but has yet to be charged with. \nKane is under investigation for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman this summer at his home in the Buffalo suburbs. Whether he will be charged is unknown, but Kane maintains his innocence and the Blackhawks are standing by him and allowing him to play while this all plays out. \nAlthough the NHL is monitoring the situation, it has no legal justification at this point to prevent Kane from playing because he has not been charged. So, Kane will continue to play and continue to be a focal point whenever he plays. Unless you are a Blackhawks’ fan or Kane friend or family member, however, he is difficult to root for right now. \nHis world class stick handling skill makes him a fascinating player to watch whenever he has the puck. As former Devil — and one-time U.S. Olympic team linemate — Zach Parise once said, \"Me, you and him could be in a phone booth and we wouldn’t touch the puck.\" \nUnder different circumstances, anyone who enjoys the game of hockey played at its highest level would appreciate Kane. Now, however, it’s difficult to take any enjoyment out of what he does. \nAnd, barring something happening that completely exonerates him, that’s unlikely to change for some time. Even if he is never charged or convicted, that might mean there just wasn’t sufficient evidence, not necessarily the alleged rape definitely didn’t happen. \nAccording to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, out of 100 instances of rape, only 12 lead to an arrest, five result in a conviction and just three end up with the rapist serving any jail time. \nThose are the overwhelmingly discouraging numbers facing Kane’s accuser. \nSo, though Kane is innocent until proven guilty, it will continue to be difficult to celebrate anything he does on the ice.
