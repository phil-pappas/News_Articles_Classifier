Instead, it just says \"Washington\" for the opponent Sunday. Through the team's first three games, the opponents on the media guide cover were referred to as the Atlanta Falcons, Dallas Cowboys and New York Jets. Director of media relations Derek Boyko had no comment, and team owner Jeffrey Lurie was not made available to comment on the omission of the word. Native American groups have lobbied the NFL and the Redskins to change the nickname, which they say is offensive. Coach Chip Kelly was asked before Thursday's practice. \"I have a lot of personal beliefs on things,\" Kelly said after an extended pause and smile. \"But my belief doesn't affect what that name is. They can do what they want to do.\" In two previous news conferences this week, and during Thursday's availability, Kelly never used the word Redskins either. He always referred to the opponent as Washington. Coordinators Billy Davis and Pat Shurmur did use the word Redskins during their news conferences, as did most of the team's players. In the Eagles current media guide, the name \"Redskins\" doesn't appear until the 52nd page, when the players' bios begin. The same bios are placed in each weekly media guide. In the team's Week 1 media guide for a matchup against Atlanta, the word Falcons appeared 18 times in the first two pages. The word Cowboys appeared 15 times in the first two pages of the media guide for Philadelphia's game against Dallas, and the word Jets appeared 16 times in the first two pages for last week's opponent. Of course, there are two New York teams, so using Jets was essential.
