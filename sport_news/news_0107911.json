Why would I fight somebody anyway,” the 6-foot-1 former linebacker said. ESPN Ray Lewis also says that the case against him was based on his skin color. \nLewis described the scene as “chaos” and “25-to-30 people in an all-out brawl” that night in Atlanta, when a Super Bowl party ended with two men, Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar, dead. Lewis ultimately pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor. \nOn Tuesday, TMZ reported that Lewis explained in the book that he was dressed too nicely, in a mink coat, “to start mixing it up looking like that.” \nIn his “SportsCenter” spot, Lewis said that he lives with the ramification of that night “every day of my life” and the fallout had “nothing to do with me, but everything to do with my skin color and everything to do with my name.” \nLewis also said that the arresting officers called him the N-word and that he was convicted on misdemeanor obstruction charges because “I defended myself, stupidly.” \nHe added that he didn’t settle two civil suits with the victims’ families out of guilt. \n“Guilt is only when you feel guilty and you say, ‘Listen, I’m gonna slide this to you because I really feel bad’,” he said. “I don’t feel bad about that because I sat there and spoke to both families and I said ‘Listen, what I’m doing, this ain’t about me. This is about because you let somebody confuse my name.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:20:59.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
