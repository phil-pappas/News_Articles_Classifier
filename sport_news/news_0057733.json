The Hornets host two-time state champions Pascack Valley this weekend in Little Falls. \nBut you know what? That's fine, because what Parlavecchio is getting from his players in terms of effort and intensity, has been rewarding. \nThe Hornets lost a 35-13 decision to Lakeland High School in Wanaque last Friday night. While the Hornets are 0-6, the strides are becoming more evident. \n\"We make plays, but we're not finishing drives yet,\" the coach said. \"On defense, we'll get a team in a third and long situation, but we don't wrap up on a key tackle and against the schedule we're playing, it's costly.\" \nThe Hornets have certainly not ducked anyone. Of the six teams they've played thus far, five teams are .500, or better and have a composite mark of 23-8. All five of those teams are pretty much assured playoff berths early next month. \nThis Saturday, another tough assignment awaits as 5-1 Pascack Valley, a two-time defending state champion, comes to Little Falls for a 2:30 p.m. kickoff. After that, a talented Indian Hills squad, which was 4-2 heading into this weeks' action, awaits. That's seven teams on the Hornets schedule that are headed to the postseason while an eighth school, West Milford, was 2-4, but could still qualify for the playoffs, as well. \nThe frustration is tempered by a belief that better times are coming up. The Hornets are very young, and in the second half of last week's game at Lakeland, a number of big, yet raw, linemen got a chance to play \n\"See the size of that kid?\" said Parlavecchio as a steady rain fell. \"How about that kid? Another (offseason) in the weight room and we'll be winning a bunch of these games next year. I'm confident of that. We've got a lot of kids who are getting playing experience. Things will change.\" \nOn offense last Friday, Chris Armagno, one of the few seniors with varsity experience, had a tremendous game, rushing for 115 yards and scoring a touchdown. In one game, he practically doubled his rushing total for the entire season. And if you know Armagno, this guy will never let down. He's too talented an overall athlete. \nVincent Brigati, a sophomore, has been doing a tremendous job as a running back, but a shoulder injury pretty much kept him on the sidelines against Lakeland. Junior quarterback Steve Luisa has been doing a good job, as has running back Jayvon Henry. \nWide receivers Shawn Benford, Jake Abdi and Shawn Potenzone have shown the ability to open up the offense and the defense has a group of aggressive players. \nThe PV girls' soccer team may have lost a home game to Lakeland last Friday, 4-1, but the team came away winners with a stirring tribute to Breast Cancer Awareness Month. \nPassaic Valley's Kayla Campbell helped to honor her mother, Vicki, who is a cancer survivor, and the entire team took part in forming the Breast Cancer logo on the field before the game.
