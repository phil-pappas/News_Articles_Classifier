The latest was right back Fabian Johnson, who was far more concerned about returning to his club team uninjured than playing his heart out for coach and country and sent packing from the U.S. squad before the Costa Rica game.\nAdvertisement\nSaturday’s game cried out for a player of Landon Donovan’s vision and influence in midfield, yet neither Michael Bradley or Kyle Beckerman looked remotely capable of fulfilling the role against Mexico.\nGulati will surely point out that the offensively unimpressive Mexico only just beat the U.S. at the Rose Bowl, but the Americans were frankly lucky El Tri’s territorial dominance did not result in more goals.\nSo let’s recap: Bradley was fired after blowing a two-goal lead in a big game against the USMNT arch rivals, but Klinsmann won’t be despite the Americans never looking like they were capable of victory for the vast majority of what was a dreadfully dull game until the last few minutes?\nBradley was fired despite his record, including a creditable second in the 2011 Confederations Cup, a tournament Klinsmann has never qualified for.\nDouble standard?\nUndoubtedly.\nFor more local soccer news, read the 100 Percent Soccer blog at www.insidesocal.com/soccer .\nAbout the Author Reporter covering Torrance, Lomita, Rolling Hills Estates, Palos Verdes Estates.
