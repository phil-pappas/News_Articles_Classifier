At the World Championships last spring, Seguin was without a point in the first three games and then tallied nine goals in the final six games and led the tournament in goals.\nSo maybe Tuesday against Edmonton is time for Seguin's breakout. The versatile forward has played right wing for most of the first two games in order for coach Lindy Ruff to get Cody Eakin onto the top line. However, Seguin was moved back to center Monday, and Patrick Eaves was moved to the right wing.\n\"I'll play both and do whatever I need to do, but center fits my game more,\" Seguin said. \"I think I stop more on the wing, and I get to skate more at center, and I like skating.\"\nHe also likes his chemistry with left wing Jamie Benn, and that's easier to create when he's playing center. Last season, Benn won the scoring title with 87 points in 82 games while Seguin finished seventh with 77 points in 71 games. Both said they are committed to team defense this season and believe the key to success is playing a strong two-way game and following the instructions of Ruff.\n\"We have a plan, and we're going to stick to it,\" Benn said. \"We think we can create offense out of defense. We can score, we just need to be smart about it.\"\nRuff said the team that finished second in the NHL last season in goals might sacrifice scoring for defense.\n\"I want this team to be a no-excuse team,\" Ruff said Monday. \"It doesn't matter if you're a winger or a center man -- defend, defend with passion.\"\nThat was a strong message after the Stars were skewered in Colorado 6-3 on Saturday night. Dallas seemed to do the little things right in a 3-0 win over Pittsburgh on opening night but lost track of the details against the Avalanche. So Ruff juggled his lines, moving Seguin back to center and dropping Eakin to a line with Mattias Janmark and Ales Hemsky. The message was the team has to play smart, intense hockey, and every line has to be engaged.\n\"We've been working hard at blocking shots and getting people in the right places,\" Ruff said.\nThe right place for Seguin might be center. But as much as he can get out and skate more, he also has responsibilities in the defensive zone. That's something Seguin said he embraces.\n\"There's a lot more stress defensively, but I want that,\" Seguin said. \"We have a different mind-set. We've been talking about it all summer, and I've been thinking about it all summer. I'm not going to be angry if I have no points but I play a good defensive game and we win. I've had that in my head for the past six months. We want to be out against the top lines, we want that challenge.\"\nTwitter: @MikeHeika\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/MikeHeika", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-13T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:04:26.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
