Murphy became the first player since Tampa Bay slugger Evan Longoria in 2008 to homer in four consecutive postseason games. \nThe best-of-seven series shifts to Wrigley Field on Tuesday night, with New York ace Jacob deGrom scheduled to pitch against Kyle Hendricks. The wild-card Cubs need a comeback to capture their first pennant in 70 years. \nArrieta gave up hits to his first three batters and was pulled after five innings -- matching his shortest start of the year. \nSlumping star David Wright put the Mets in front with a hit-and-run double in the first. Murphy followed with a two-run shot.
