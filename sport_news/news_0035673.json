It starts with our youth program. They're unbelievable. Our parents group is so supportive. I have the best coaching staff in the world.\" \nMoments like the one Krause and his Muskego football team experience Friday night are special. The Warriors knocked off the area's top-ranked team in front of a packed house on parents night to win a share of the Classic 8 title and signal they'll be a force when the playoffs begin next week. \nAnd in the big picture of building a football program, the victory was a major step toward Muskego (8-1, 6-1) establishing itself as a consistent big winner in one of the state's toughest conferences. In 2012, the Warriors, new to the league after a long run in the Southeast Conference, produced a middle-of-the pack finish. In 2013 they dipped to 2-5 in the league. Last season, however, sparked by a prolific offense, the team was part of a four-way tie for the title. \nThis year the team proved it wasn't a one-year wonder. Needing a victory over Arrowhead (8-1, 6-1 Classic 8) to force a tie, Muskego unveiled a no-huddle attack, started fast start and played physically up front to grind away precious clock as Arrowhead tried to rally. \n\"We had one of the best crowds of the year at this game,\" said senior fullback Brett Finke, who gained 59 yards in 15 carries. \"Everyone came out strong. Everyone was pumped up. Back-to-back conference championships, you couldn't ask for anything more out here. Everyone worked their butt off.\" \nSenior Ayden Malcomson finished with 133 yards and a touchdown in 21 carries for Muskego. Backfield mate Colin O'Neill, another senior, added 108 yards in 18 carries and scored on a 36-yard run on the team's first possession of the second half to help it extend its lead to 27-6. \nIn all, Muskego ran for 319 yards in 62 carries, for a 5.1-yard average. The team has had bigger games this season, but the production of the unit was spot on, especially in the first quarter, when the Warriors scored on their first three possessions. \nThe first time they went 59 yards in 12 plays before senior Stevan Kreck nailed a 36-yard field goal to make it a 3-0 game with 6 minutes 6 seconds left in the first quarter. \nThe Warriors' next possession was set up by a senior Austin Lambrecht's tackle of Arrowhead senior running back Nick Bastien for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-one at the Arrowhead 34. One play later Malcomson caught a pass from senior Caleb Wagner and weaved his way for a 33-yard touchdown at the 3:40 mark. \nArrowhead went three-and-out on its next possession and Muskego took over on its 31. Malcomson broke off a 50-yard run on the first play of that drive to set up his 1-yard scoring run six plays later. \nJust one quarter was done and Arrowhead trailed, 17-0. \n\"We knew they were a good program, and we didn't rise to the moment tonight and I've got to fix that,\" Arrowhead coach Greg Malling said. \nThe Warhawks climbed back into the game with second-half touchdowns by senior quarterback Johnny Duranso on a 25-yard run with 5:35 left in the third quarter and a 15-yard pass from senior Jack Risch to senior Andy Miller with 3:10 to play. Risch replaced Duranso after Dursano suffered a leg injury late in third quarter. \nMuskego wasn't able to answer those scores, but it was able to run down the clock. After Duranso's score, the Warriors chewed up 4 minutes before giving back the ball and the Warriors ate up the first 7 minutes of the fourth quarter before returning the ball to Arrowhead with a 14-point lead. \nFittingly Muskego closed the victory out by grinding out yards behind the team's offensive line. After junior Shane Dombrowski recovered Arrowhead's onside kick with 3:09 left, Muskego got two first downs to run out the clock and seal back-to-back conference championships. \nNow it's on the playoffs, where Muskego hopes to go further than last year, when it was bumped out in the second round. \n\"The first thing coach said to me after the win was 'We're still hungry. Five more,'\" Finke said. \"We're happy we won, but we've still got our biggest game ahead of us.\" BOX SCORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:04:03.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
