Lady Hornets picked to win MIAA The Emporia Gazette emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nThe Emporia State women’s basketball team received an expected No. 1 position in the MIAA’s Preseason Coaches Poll, released Thursday. The ESU men were picked 11th. \nThe Lady Hornets received the maximum 13 first-place votes, as a coach can’t vote for his or her own team, following a No. 1 national ranking they received by DII Bulletin. \nESU brings back four starters, including MIAA Freshman of the Year Addie Lackey and First Team All-MIAA guard Kelly Moten, from the 2014-15 season that ended in the Final Four. \nThe Lady Hornets take on the University of Kansas in an exhibition on Nov. 8 in Lawrence. ESU opens its regular season Nov. 13 at Southwestern Oklahoma. \nFort Hays State was slated second in the women’s poll, receiving the only other first-place vote, while Central Missouri was picked third ahead of Pittsburg State. \nIn the men’s poll, Northwest Missouri was tabbed No. 1 in the conference, though five teams received a first-place vote. Nine votes separated second (Central Missouri) and fifth (Pittsburg State), with ESU’s 58 trailing Washburn (72) and Missouri Western in a tie for ninth. \nThe Hornets return their top six scorers from 2014-15, which saw them finish with a 12-16 record and missing the MIAA Tournament. ESU added a collection of transfers, with two listed at 6-foot-11 (Kevin Allen, Boise State) and 7-foot (Bradley Fisher, Montana State). \nMIAA Women’s Preseason Coaches Poll \n1.
