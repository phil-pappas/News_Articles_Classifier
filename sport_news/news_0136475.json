Gary R. Blockus Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Lehigh Valley Phantoms coach Scott Gordon once worshipped an Olympic hero \nGrowing up in Easton, Mass., Scott Gordon looked up to hometown hero Jim Craig, the goalie for the 1980 Olympic gold-medal winning U.S. hockey team that upset the USSR in the semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y. \nGordon, then 17, was six years younger than Craig. \n\"When he was [at Boston University], I went to the same high school,\" the 52-year-old Gordon said. \"It was one of those things, if he could do it, I could do it. I kept working at it. Next thing you know, I go to college, he goes to the Olympics and plays a little pro hockey. For me, that was the next phase where you have this sense of being around someone you know who you can follow their path and see how they do it, and that's how it worked for me.\" \nGordon went on to play at Boston College, in the minors, in the NHL for the Quebec Nordiques by the 1990-91 season, and then for the U.S. Olympic men's ice hockey team at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, a team that finished one spot off the podium. \nAfter his playing career ended following the 1993-94 season, he started coaching and has never looked back. He coached with the Providence Bruins from 2000-02 through 2007-08, serving as head coach for the last six seasons. He led the club to the AHL playoffs in five of those six seasons, including a league-best 55-18-7 mark in his final season, when he earned the Louis A.R. Pieri Memorial Award as AHL coach of the year.

He is looking to make a difference for the young, developing talent in his charge while maintaining the ever-delicate balance of shepherding talent in the ultimate goal of a winning culture. \n\"You can have success, but at the end of the day, you also have to help the players with the ability to earn success,\" Gordon said. \nHe credited the Boston Bruins' good draft picks for his success in Providence. \n\"As much success as I had as a coach, we had some pretty good players go through there,\" he said. \"Coaching is just finding a way to reach the players and get them to pull together and play a good team game that allows us to have success.\" \nThe Phantoms haven't made the Calder Cup playoffs in six seasons, and Gordon has a wealth of young defensive talent on the squad this season, including the offensive dynamo that is Shayne Gostisbehere and 6-foot-7 first-year pro Samuel Morin, who was more impressive in Flyers camp last year than this year. \nGordon said his coaching philosophy is constantly evolving, even drawing on football coaches such as Bill Belichick and Urban Meyer for morsels of ideas. Ultimately, though, it is the players on ice who need to perform. \n\"You can't say we'll win and then we'll develop,\" Gordon admitted. \"You have to develop and then you'll win.\" \nGordon gave the example of a center not being very strong at faceoffs, but giving him a chance for a defensive draw with the team holding a two-goal lead. If he starts to experience success in those situations, he could be doing defensive draws with a one-goal lead, eventually to taking them with the game on the line. \n\"You want to give him the opportunity to be in that situation,\" Gordon explained. \"There's different things you can have from a responsibility situation that you can work on in the game with younger players depending on their readiness to do it. You don't want to give them the whole thing right away. You can't say you're on the top power play, you're on the top penalty kill when they're not ready to do that.\" \nOf all the Phantoms players' attributes he observed at rookie and main training camp, skating ability is the one that stood out most to him . Everyone he watched skated well and could make plays, unlike other camps he's been at where lesser skaters stuck out for all the wrong reasons. \nMany times last season, it seemed the opponents skated better and pushed the pace on the Phantoms, and Gordon said the goal is to flip that around this season. \n\"It's a skating game today,\" he said. \"If you're playing the games at three-quarter speed, you're going to be a step behind. You're going to give the opponent more time to have looks and make plays. But if you're matching their urgency to go back and get the puck, put pressure on their defense, taking away the time and space of their forwards, you're going to set yourself up for more opportunities because you're going to create mistakes by the opponents.\" \nGordon grew up just 30 miles from Boston and became a Bruins fans, although his professional life has changed that affinity. Instead, he holds on to his roots as a Patriots and Red Sox fan. \nHe also holds dearly to his family, wife Jennifer whom he met during his first years coaching as an assistant with the Atlanta Knights of the defunct IHL, which was then the top minor league affiliate of the Tampa Bay Lightning; his 16-year-old son Erik, a goalie at Cheshire Academy in Connecticut, and 13-year-old son Ryan, who plays forward for a team in Atlanta. \nFor Gordon, hockey is clearly a way of life, with coaching his current passion. \n\"When I was done playing, I didn't know I was going to be a coach,\" he said. \"I had an opportunity so I tried it and I learned very quickly there's a lot to learn as you go along. It becomes something where you're always learning so it never gets boring â€¦ the striving to win, trying to develop players. There's so much that gets your brain going, that brings excitement to your day-to-day activities that makes it an enjoyable experience.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:28:06.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
