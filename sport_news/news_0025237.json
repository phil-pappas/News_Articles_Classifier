He entered a city school to a huge roar from the kids who had gathered to take part in an inter-school kabaddi tournament. Wearing a light pink shirt and a blue jeans, he looked pretty cool, composed and grounded even though he was overwhelmed by the reception.\n\"We kabaddi players were not used to this publicity. It's only because of PKL that the game and the players got reorganization,\" the star raider told TOI on the sidelines of the tournament.\nThe 32-year-old Anup, an Arjuna Awardee, was a bit shy initially but opened up once the talk veered towards the game. He is too passionate about the game and he said he doesn't play the game for money.\n\"In my village in Haryana, kabaddi is huge, bigger than even cricket. I started as a kid and played for passion. It is because of the game that I got a government job and now became a celebrity,\" the police inspector with Haryana Police said.\nSkipper of U Mumba, Anup is proud to be part of 2010 and 2014 Asian Games gold medal winning Indian team but rues the fact that he can never be called an Olympian.\n\"Those gold medals are the highlights of my career. But, I feel sad that kabaddi is not an Olympic game and I will never be called an Olympian,\" rues Anup but hopefully added: \"My seven-year-old son Kunal is a good kabaddi player and I hope he plays for India and the game gets entry to Olympics.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:50:44.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
