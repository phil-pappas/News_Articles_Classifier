Home Minister Rajnath Singh is also expected to be present in the meeting. The delegation, which includes 35 family members, will urge the PM to declassify all top-secret files held by the Centre and the IB to solve the mystery surrounding the freedom fighter's disappearance in 1945. Besides, they will also ask the PM to write to other countries, including Russia, to declassify files of Netaji in possession of their respective spy agencies. The West Bengal government had recently released 64 files of Netaji. Senior BJP leaders said it was up to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister to open the files. However, the family members believe that what happened seven decades back will not harm India’s relations with other nations in the present day. Besides, the then Prime Minister himself was keen on ascertaining the truth about Netaji's disappearance, they add. Notably, while in opposition, the BJP had demanded declassification of all Netaji files. However, the Modi government refused an RTI application for opening the files, saying it would adversely affect the country's relations with friendly foreign nations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:06:22.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
