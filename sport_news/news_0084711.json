(AP) — Mario Gutierrez rode five winners in the first six races Friday at Santa Anita. \nHe won the first race by 1 1/2 lengths with even-money favorite Stealth Drone. He skipped the second and then won the third by 1 1/4 lengths with 8-1 shot Frank Conversation, trained by Doug O’Neill and owned by J. Paul Reddam. \nGutierrez teamed with them when he rode I’ll Have Another to victory in the 2012 Kentucky Derby and Preakness. \nHe won the fourth race by 3 1/2 lengths on 9-5 shot Lily Pod. Gutierrez caught a break in the fifth race. He was moved up from second to first aboard 9-5 shot Sleepwalker via a disqualification of the winner. He won the sixth race by a nose aboard Light Striker. \nGutierrez says he once won five races in a day at Hastings Racecourse in Vancouver, British Columbia. \nThe 29-year-old jockey didn’t have a mount in the last two races on the card.
