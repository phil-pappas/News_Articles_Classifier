It felt great getting that touchdown, first one of the year for me, and getting some momentum going at halftime.\" \nHollister ran a shallow post route and Coffman put the ball on the money between a few Lobos. Hollister soared to grab the ball, then absorbed a strong hit from a New Mexico safety. \n\"At the tight end position, he's probably one of the more athletic kids you're going to see,\" LaDage said. \"He's got really good hand-eye coordination. He can go up and get the ball. \n\"I joke with him that he's got a little flare for the dramatic when he does go up for it, has to make it look pretty. He's just got really good ball skills.\" \nThe 6-foot-4, 230-pound Hollister's ability was on display plenty against New Mexico, as he established himself as one of Wyoming's top receiving targets. \nHe caught a career-high five passes and tied another career high with 75 receiving yards. \n\"He brings what not a lot of other tight ends bring, which is speed,\" wide receiver Tanner Gentry said. \"He's got really good speed. When he's matched up on a linebacker or safety, we know that he can win.\" \nIn Wyoming's first three games, he recorded seven receptions — one against North Dakota and three each against Eastern Michigan and Washington State. \n\"We'd like to actually integrate him more into our passing game,\" UW coach Craig Bohl said. \"There's been a couple times that we missed a read here or there. He's an explosive guy that can get vertical down the field. We're in hopes that we can utilize him more.\" \nLast season, Hollister caught 17 balls for 244 yards and two touchdowns. He particularly came on strong in the final four games, making 10 catches, including both scores. \n\"I think we saw some things last year, in particular toward the end,\" UW offensive coordinator Brent Vigen said. \"We saw that Jacob has the ability to take a step.\" \nThe Bend, Oregon, native began his college career as a walk-on quarterback at Nevada before transferring to Arizona Western Community College and becoming a tight end. \nSince coming to Wyoming, Hollister's primary role has been as a blocker, though, in the Cowboys' pro-style, run-first offense. Thus, his offseason focus was adding muscle to his frame. \n\"Coach LaDage will say all the time that the pass game for me will come pretty natural, but it's really important to focus on technique and putting on weight and stuff like that to put toward a good blocking game,\" Hollister said. \nYet, UW recognizes the importance of his pass-catching ability. \nOnly Hollister, Gentry and wide receiver Jake Maulhardt have caught more than six passes this season. \nWith Hollister emerging as a viable receiving threat, the Cowboys will look to double down on their starting tight end. \n\"He's a great receiver and I'm surprised we haven't been able to get the ball to him more,\" UW quarterback Cameron Coffman said. \"Hopefully we can start to use him a little bit more because he's a great weapon for us and when we do throw him the ball he always makes the plays.\" \nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)
