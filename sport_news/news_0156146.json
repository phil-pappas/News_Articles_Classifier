Appearing in the case for the first time before a Division Bench headed by Justice Mohammad Yaqboob Mir, Advocate General Jahangir Iqbal accepted the notice in the petition and sought more time to file the response of the Jammu and Kashmir Government. Making his submission in the High Court, the Advocate General did not make any statement that the state government had filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against what it termed as two “conflicting” orders of the High Court pertaining to slaughter of bovine animals and ban on beef sale. Admitting a writ petition filed by a former law professor of Kashmir University, SM Afzal Qadri, challenging the constitutional validity of Sections 298-A, 298-B and other sections, a Division Bench of the High Court issued a notice to the state government on September 16 and made it clear that pendency of the petition was not a bar for the state or the legislature to scrap or amend the sections. Ever since the petition came up before the Srinagar Bench of the High Court, the government had been avoiding a public stand over the beef ban row, which had the potential of damaging the prospects of the PDP and the BJP in their respective voter bastions, Kashmir and Jammu, and had already polarised the two regions on communal lines. The government had delayed filing its reply whether it stood for retaining the penal sections or for scrapping or amending the sections. Acting on a public interest litigation, the Jammu Bench of the High Court directed the police on September 9 to strictly implement laws regulating ban on bovine slaughter and beef sale. Sources in the Law Ministry indicated that even though the state government had approached the Supreme Court against the September 8 and September 16 orders of the High Court, there was no consensus between the two allies on what stand the state should take in the High Court. It was being pointed out that move to approach the Supreme Court was a delaying tactic and a ploy of the government to avoid taking a public stand either in the High Court or during the forthcoming Assembly session, where it would face three anti-beef ban Bills of National Conference and two Independent MLAs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:16:11.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
