The Spring Hill Bears had another big and tough match-up on the gridiron this past Friday night hosting the No. 2 ranked and undefeated Mt. Ida Lions for 7-2A Conference football action for week six of high school football. The Bears came into their match-up confident and ready to battle, but the Lions raised their level of road play at Bear Stadium to head back to Mt. Ida for a 41-0 win. The Bears fall to 4-2 overall, 1-2 in conference as the Mt. Ida Lions improve to 6-0 overall, 3-0 in conference. Head coach Russell Carter knew this game would be the toughest match-up his Bears have faced all season long. Carter hope their game plan would be effective, the Lions just were a little more productive on the field to escape with victory. “Mt. Ida is just a good football team. We had good drives going , couldn't move the ball inside. Mt. Ida is by far the best team we've played this year. It was a physical game. We'll try to regroup this week and get ready for Gurdon. Our main goal is to make the playoffs and still have a chance,” said Carter. The Bears racked up a 100 plus yards against the Lions and hope to keep building and enhancing their running attack to be effective as the season progresses. This week, the Bears head to G-town to face the Gurdon Go-Devils for another big conference battle. The Go-Devils are 3-3 overall, tied for first place with Mt. Ida and Lafayette County in the conf. at 3-0. Friday's kickoff set for 7 p.m. in Gurdon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:01:59.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
