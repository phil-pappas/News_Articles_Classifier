The blight destroyed trees that had stood for more than a century, reaching heights beyond 100 feet with base diameters of 10 feet.\nFew remained, but interested tree lovers such as Herbert F. Darling Jr. of Williamsville found a survivor on the Southern Tier and began looking for ways to restore this majestic, fruitful tree.\nRich Wells of East Concord, another ardent tree grower, became interested in the chestnut restoration effort in 1974, planting seeds on his hillside property with some success.\nThe American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) was formed in 1983 and Darling became an energetic force in its programs. He served as the first president of the New York State Chapter. Today, at age 82, Darling is a dynamic presence at these harvesting and restoration programs. That Saturday, he walked and drove gear and goods up and down the 15-acre hillside where the state chapter of TACF first obtained a planting area for American chestnut trees in 1994.\nAt the top of the hillside is a high-fenced, two-acre plot where Darling and Wells showed tree stock somewhat protected from deer and other animal incursions.\n“But the blight still gets them,” Darling said, pointing out the swollen area of a tree’s trunk that, at first sight, looked like the slight rubbing that deer do during the removal of velvet matter on their antlers.\nThese blight “rubs” are less visible but potentially more harmful to chestnut trees.\n“This tree might survive that blight,” Darling said of the many varieties of blight-resistant stock planted in the two-acre plot and across the entire 15 acres of stock.\nBoth in the open areas and around the enclosed area, resistance and mortality of trees varies. Trees that looked healthy last year may be dying next to a weak tree that is now burgeoning. For this and other reasons, volunteers try to plant as many trees as possible to find the most healthy of stock.\nEach year, volunteers meet on a Saturday in late September or early October to pick these spiny burs with hopes of obtaining seeds that will be resistant to if not free of blight damage. A trio of Michael Anna and his son Dylan of Chaffee and Ben Weaver, Darling’s grandson, met us halfway up the hill as they used pruning poles to clip branches with clusters of burs.\nLike Darling and Wells, Michael Anna does his own planting each year in hopes of raising healthy chestnut tree stock.\n“I planted 160 seeds last year and some are showing well,” Anna said of his efforts at home.\nAnna added, “The tree is beautiful and majestic, but the real reason it should be restored is that it’s a great food source. If you set out nuts and acorns from all other trees, the deer would polish off the chestnuts before they touched any of the other crops.”\nExperts agree that the fruits of American chestnuts were once bountiful and a main-food crop for other animals and birds as well as whitetail deer.\nThe New York State chapter of TACF focuses its efforts on pure strains of American stock of chestnut trees rather than growing hybrid versions mainly obtained from China.\nWells explained, “The American trees are good timber trees. They grow straight and tall. The Chinese trees produce seeds but are not as resistant to blight and they grow more like spreading fruit trees rather than vertical, timber trees.”\nWhile blight presence still permeates chestnut stock, the New York planting and harvesting program has developed healthy versions that expand in planted numbers each growing season.\nBurs, once picked, begin to split and eventually seeds can be removed from each opening pod. Numbers vary. A bur/pod could contain one, two, three or possibly more seeds. At latest count, Darling had opened the burs picked on Oct. 3 and has about 2,500 seeds ready for planting. A single tree-seed can be planted, but it takes at least two trees to cross pollinate and eventually produce burs with healthy seeds.\nBoth Darling and Wells welcome land owners to try growing American chestnut tree stock on their property.\n“We’ll gladly supply the seeds or seedlings for free,” Wells said of the stock taken this year. Seeds can be kept in a cooler inside plastic bags with dampened moss or paper towels until planting time in the spring.\nTo get in on this tree-planting effort, check with Wells at 592-9596 or Darling at 632-1125.\nemail: odrswill@gmail.com", "external_links": ["http://dec.ny.gov/outdoor/7860"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:56:56.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
