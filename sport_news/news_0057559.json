It's an incredible feeling.\" \nHealy exploits will never be forgotten by the Green and White Army, who took the opportunity to laud their retired hero with a rousing chant in the second half. \n\"It was a little bit embarrassing if I'm honest,\" he said. \n\"To be sitting there on a night like that and have the fans singing my name... it's this team that has put Northern Ireland on the map. \n\"Steven Davis scored twice and put in a man-of-the-match performance that was nothing short of amazing. \n\"I can't speak highly enough of him. He doesn't always get the plaudits he should over in England, but I call him the 'ginger maestro'. He's that good.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:52:04.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
