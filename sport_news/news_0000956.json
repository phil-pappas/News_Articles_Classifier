CHICAGO – At the top of the Mets’ dugout he stood, two arms raised to the Chicago sky, two fists clenched in triumph, two lungs emptied by a primal scream. For so much of this Mets’ playoff run, Daniel Murphy shouldered the offensive load, but here, as he watched Lucas Duda’s first-inning home run tuck itself just inside Wrigley Field’s left centerfield seats, he was set free.\nNine innings later, it was Murphy and the Mets letting themselves loose on a baseball celebration 15 years in the making, Murphy sprinting in from the infield, his teammates climbing over the dugout walls, all of them converging over the prayerful form of closer Jeurys Familia, whose called third strike was nothing less than the 27th out in a National League pennant-clinching win. The Mets’ beat the Cubs, 8-3 Wednesday night at Wrigley Field, completing a stunning series sweep, opening the door to baseball’s last stand.\nThe Mets are going to the World Series.\nOnce more, with feeling: The Mets are going to the World Series.\n“That was a lot of fun,” Murphy would say later, putting voice to the one emotion every Mets fan can share today. “I think the group of guys in there makes it that much more fun when each guy still cares for the guy next to him. You get so excited when you’re able to come together and accomplish something like this. We know there are still some more wins we want to get our hands on, so we’re going to enjoy this right now, and you see everybody get a piece of it, it makes it very special.”\nWith Duda’s three-run home run, with Travis d’Arnaud’s solo shot to follow it, with a lineup that batted around in the first, with a rookie pitcher who stepped into the batter’s box before stepping onto the mound and then delivered 4 2/3 effective innings, with a manager who pushed every right button and pulled every right string, with the MVP Murphy later homering for a Major League baseball sixth consecutive game, with all of that coming together on one magical might, the Mets swept their way past the overmatched Cubs, earning the franchise’s first World Series appearance since 2000 and first chance to win it all since 1986.\n“This city deserves this, this organization deserves this, the fans deserve it and this group of guys deserves it,” Wright was shouting into an on-field microphone. “I feel like this team is part the 1969 Miracle Mets and part the 1986 team, part Ya gotta believe. To think that we can go down with the greatest teams in Mets history, it’s incredible.”\nWhat these Mets have done to capture all of our sporting imaginations has indeed been incredible, unleashing their intoxicating brand of youthful enthusiasm and veteran guile on the baseball world, reminding us all what it feels like to hop aboard a joy-filled bandwagon and take the heady ride.\nIt began with a first inning that encapsulated everything these Mets are, that implemented everything they hoped to be this season. With four two-out runs, the Mets took hold of Wrigley’s hopeful heart and squeezed the life right out of it, reducing the teeming, rollicking, hollering home crowd to a stunned, silent mass.\nHere was leadoff hitter Curtis Granderson, working his way to a two-strike hit. There was Yoenis Cespedes working his way to a two-out walk, keeping a brewing rally alive.\nAnd then came Duda, the last Mets hitter to RSVP on his invitation to the playoff party, but who made his arrival count more than anything he could have done before. As if the first-inning home run wasn’t enough to erase the dismal statistics of his 2015 postseason to date (3-for-24, 13 strikeouts), Duda added two more RBIs in the second inning, a scorching double to centerfield that brought David Wright and Murphy across home plate.\n“That was definitely nice,” Duda said after tying a franchise record with his five-RBI night. “This is just unbelievable. The chemistry in the clubhouse is awesome, so fun to be around. These guys are like 25 of my brothers. I couldn’t be happier for them or for our fans.”\nIt was Wright and Murphy who’d been the hitting stars of the previous night’s win, but it was in the heady euphoria of Tuesday’s 5-2 decision that the duo flashed its veteran mettle, cautioning anyone willing to listen that the series wasn’t over, that the Mets had every reason to push through Game 4 as if it were Game 7, that nothing would feel better than to uncork the champagne bottles, flood the cramped clubhouse with another river of celebration, spill onto the field to continue the party, and ultimately, to board the flight home without ever giving the Cubs a shred of hope.\nThe players listened, trusting the words of the men their manager trusted most, knowing Terry Collins was secure in leaving the task to his most veteran players. It was Collins who emerged onto the field with an open bottle, shaking it and pointing it in the direction of the stands, dousing the throng of New York fans still dancing behind the visitor’s dugout. Like everything else he has touched this postseason, Collins hit his mark. The baseball lifer – at 66, he’s is the game’s oldest manager, and he is only now taking his first team to the World Series – could barely believe what had happened.\n“I’m sitting there or I’m standing there in the dugout in the ninth inning and I’m looking around the field and looking down in the dugout, and I’m just looking at all the guys, thinking how did they do it?,” he said. “ How did they keep it together? How did they stay focused?”\nThey did because he did. They won four straight, pushing the Cubs toward a 108th straight season without a title, pushing themselves into a World Series meeting with either the Royals or Blue Jays, pushing the memory of Adam Wainwright’s knee-buckling 2006 curveball deeper into the graveyard of regret.\nReplace it all now with the images of joy, of the moving blob of hugging humanity that melted all those Mets uniforms into one massive group hug, with the smiling faces that extracted themselves from the pile to don championship caps and pull on championship t-shirts, with the bear hug the long Met holdovers Wright and Murphy shared on the field, with the sprays of champagne and beer that soaked them all.\nReplace it now with one single thought: The Mets are going to the World Series.\n \nEmail: Sullivan@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:00:50.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
