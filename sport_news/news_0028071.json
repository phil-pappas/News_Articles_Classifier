HOMECOMING: Billy Slater returned to Innisfail yesterday, attending the Billy Slater League Tag Challenge for Primary schools. PICTURE: MARC MCCORMACK Source: News Limited \nBILLY Slater’s commitment to inspiring two children has made him a role model to the hundreds in Innisfail now chasing his autograph. \nRugby league royalty returned home yesterday, the kid told he was too small, now stands as a giant on the field named in his honour. \nThe Queen isn’t received like this. \nNothing is off limits. \nAnything not nailed down is handed over by Far North primary school pupils — and their parents — in search of a signature. \nSlater carries a pen in his pocket to keep up with the demands. Has to. \nThe shoulder surgery that ended his NRL season threatens to be replaced by a sprained wrist, yet the smile plastered on the superstar guest suggests nothing is a pain today. \nIntentional or not, here stands a role model giving back to those in the Far North dedicated to rugby league and inspired by one of their own. Yet the 32-year-old’s status starts at home with the two most important people in his life — daughter Tyla Rose, 7, and son Jake, 5. \n“It’s something that’s associated with what we do but I don’t focus on being a role model,” Slater tells The Cairns Post . THE CHAMP: Billy Slater returns to Innisfail to attend the Billy Slater League Tag Challenge for Primary schools. PICTURE: MARC MCCORMACK Source: News Corp Australia \n“I just try to be the best person I can be and if people want to take lead from that, so be it. \n“I just try and be a role model for my two kids, they are the most important people in my life and I’ve got to show them the right and wrong ways of doing things.” \nThe Maroons hero is certainly ticking the right boxes. \nA Billy Slater Family Fun Night was held in front of 400 doting disciples on Tuesday, while the eighth annual Billy Slater League Tag Challenge brought out more than 500 pupils. \n“I get as much enjoyment out of coming here as the kids do,” he says. \n“This is where it all started for me and they were really enjoyable days. \n“Growing up in Innisfail you wanted to play for Australia and Queensland but you just aspired to play A-grade for the Leprechauns. That seemed like a huge thing and if you could achieve that it would be great. \n“To come back here and be a part of a day that’s named after you is humbling.” \nDad Ron and uncle John watch on, proud of the man that they have seen grow from knockabout junior to blue-chip footy god. \n“We didn’t do anything special bringing him up,” Ron says. \n“I got raised swimming in a river, not a pool, and Bill was the same: tough. \n“My old man taught him how to ride a horse when he was very small. \n“He’s a country kid and he’s been brought up with no shirt on. \n“When he was five or six, as a ball boy, he’d always follow me around in the dressing sheds. \n“He was thieving gear, soft drinks, whatever he could lay his hands on.

He never had a teddy bear, just a football. He was always going to play.” \nWhat makes the Slater story so compelling is the fact it’s so unlikely. \nHe started playing in Innisfail as a tiny five-year-old in under-8s, an early pointer to questions over his size that would later make NRL scouts baulk. \n“The thing I talk about (to the kids) is not limiting your dreams, making sure if you want to do something don’t think you can’t do it,”he says. \n“I never thought I’d be playing for Australia and Queensland and winning premierships, so it’s possible. \n“I was just a kid who loved footy. \n“I didn’t excel in juniors and didn’t make rep teams but it shows it’s not the be all and end all. \n“The first time I ever played for Queensland was in front of 50,000 people in Origin at Suncorp Stadium. \n“So you don’t have to go about it in the traditional way. \n“Anything is possible.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:35:26.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
