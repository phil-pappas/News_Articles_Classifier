(Photo: Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE A few additional fantasy nuggets to help owners set their Week 5 lineups, including injuries, sit/start matchup and the stat of the week.\nInjury report\nQB Andrew Luck, Colts (questionable)\nSat out last Sunday with an injured shoulder, but is expected to start with backup Matt Hasselbeck now questionable as well.\nWR Cecil Shorts, Texans (out)\nShort turnaround won’t give his dislocated shoulder enough time to heal. DeAndre Hopkins may see double-coverage as a result.\nRB Marshawn Lynch, Seahawks (questionable)\nA full week of rest should help him get back on the field, but it comes against an imposing Bengals run defense.\nTE Jordan Reed, Redskins (doubtful)\nA concussion that forced him to leave last week’s game early comes on top of existing knee, ankle ailments.\nRB Karlos Williams, Bills (questionable)\nHas yet to practice this week due to a concussion. With LeSean McCoy’s hamstring not 100%, Anthony Dixon could start.\nRB Andre Ellington, Cardinals (questionable)\nAlmost played last Sunday for the first time since Week 1. While he could be active vs. the Rams, don’t expect too much.\nWR Steve Smith, Ravens (doubtful)\nFractures in his back aren’t believed to be a long-term issue. Kamar Aiken has stepped up nicely in Smith’s place.\nWR Steve Johnson, Chargers (questionable)\nSore hamstring makes him a risky play on Monday night, but also makes the return of TE Antonio Gates even more important.\n-- Steve Gardner, USA TODAY Sports\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 5 fantasy football rankings\nKey matchup\nSTART: RB Todd Gurley, Rams\nGurley is finally healthy and it showed in Week 4. The rookie ran for 146 yards on 19 carries against a stout Arizona Cardinals defense. Gurley should be busy against a Packers run defense that allows 4.8 yards per carry. , Gurley is priced right at $7,000 in FantasyScore.com contests and should finish as a top-10 running back.\nSIT: RB Joseph Randle, Cowboys\nA goal-line fumble that was overturned by replay still seemed to put him out of favor with the Cowboys coaching staff. He's averaging 3.9 yards per carry and losing touches to Darren McFadden and Christine Michael. The Patriots have struggled against the run this season, however spending $6,400 on Randle in FantasyScore.com contests is risky business.\n— Marc Caviglia, BrunoBoys.net\nFANTASYSCORE\nFantasyScore 1-Day Fantasy Leagues\nStat of the week\n73.3%\nReception rate for the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Allen Hurns, which ranks fourth among wide receivers with at least 25 targets. He trails only Larry Fitzgerald (81.1%), Antonio Brown (77.3%) and A.J. Green (73.5%).\n-- Ken Pomponio, TheHuddle.com\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT ", "external_links": ["http://www.fantasyscore.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/78c3e36c418349924ad2a7d29f71b1f5f7fa07f3/c=206-0-3947-2813&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798393848815754-USP-NFL-Detroit-Lions-at-Seattle-Seahawks-001.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Ruq0Nj&text=Week%205%20fantasy%20football%20tips&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Ruq0Nj&mini=true", "http://www.thehuddle.com/", "http://www.brunoboys.net/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798393848815754-USP-NFL-Detroit-Lions-at-Seattle-Seahawks-001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebc9519ac086054fa5092ba711393606fbfe81d3/r=300/https/i1.wp.com/usatfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/rob-gronkowski-new-england-patriots_0927151-e1444152947398.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9d248512140ed54310b253e76c0c504058f502d1/r=300/http/www.fantasyscore.com/img/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798393848815754-USP-NFL-Detroit-Lions-at-Seattle-Seahawks-001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:51:13.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
