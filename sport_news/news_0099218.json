Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen STARTING PITCHERS -- Justin Verlander: What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Verlander landed on the DL for the first time in his career, injuring his triceps late in spring training. He got back in June and his first six starts were rough as he worked himself back into form. His ERA on July 19 was 6.62. In his next 13 starts, though, Verlander showed the organization he was still capable of anchoring the staff. His ERA was 2.22 over that span, among the best in the American League. Opponents hit just .206 and he was ringing 98 and 99 mph on the radar gun late in games again. Verlander finding his form is the most encouraging news for the Tigers heading into 2016. Grade: B  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Anibal Sanchez: Forgettable. From start to finish. He gave up three home runs in Pittsburgh in his second start and couldn’t stop. He allowed a career-high 29 homers. His 4.99 ERA and 1.280 WHIP are the highest in any of his full major league seasons. Those inflated numbers may have been related to the shoulder issues that ended his season on Aug. 18. He was diagnosed with a rotator cuff strain and surgery was not prescribed by Dr. James Andrews. He is expected to come to training camp healthy. But, with his struggles this season, he will be one of the big question marks entering 2016. Grade: D  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Alfredo Simon: Brad Ausmus joked about his Jekyll and Hyde inconsistency, but it wasn’t all that funny – especially because he was more Hyde than Jekyll. His 5.18 ERA and 1.469 WHIP are among the worst for American League starting pitchers. He was 5-2 through May with a 2.67 ERA. After that – 8-9, 6.36 ERA. Opponents hit .279 against on the season with a .820 OPS. He will be a free agent this offseason and most likely he will sign with a National League team. This was his second go-around in the AL and he was hit around both times. Grade: C-minus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Daniel Norris: He was the Tigers’ main prize in the David Price trade and he showed why. The lefty displayed good command of a mid-90s fastball, as well as an arsenal of secondary pitches that includes a plus curveball and two different change-ups (one firmer, one traditionally slow). He also may be one of the best athletes on the team – as evidenced by his home run against the Cubs. He missed about a month with an oblique strain, but won the respect of his coaches and teammates by working himself back into the rotation before the end of the season. Could be a main piece of the 2016 rotation. Grade: B  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Matt Boyd: Overall statistics notwithstanding, there is a lot to like here. He’s not a kid, for one thing. He will be 25 in February, and he conducts himself with poise and maturity. He’s a tireless worker, never makes or accepts excuses for a poor performance and he’s just now understanding how his above-average stuff plays at the big league level. His ERA was over 8.00 after getting beat up by the Royals in early September. In his next three starts, all Tigers wins, he allowed seven runs in 17 innings and opponents hit just .135. Grade: C-minus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Randy Wolf: The 39-year was an emergency fill-in and he did produce three quality starts. He was also a positive influence on some of the young pitchers, including Boyd and Norris, whom he was with at Triple A Buffalo most of the season. But, with a fastball that barely hit 90, his margin for error in terms of location was small. If he was off just a fraction, or if he had to pitch behind in the count, the results weren’t usually favorable. Grade: D  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Kyle Lobstein: Tough year. He made the team out of spring training, holding a spot for Verlander, but his shoulder began acting up and he never regained the form he showed at the end of last season when he pitched some important games for the Tigers down the stretch. And now, with the addition of left-handers Boyd and Norris, his odds of making the rotation next season are long against him. Grade: D  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen RELIEF PITCHERS -- Alex Wilson: Hard to imagine where the Tigers would have been without him. He was used in literally every situation, including one start. He was the most trusted reliever for much of the season and, as a result, was overused. From May through July he faced 191 hitters who hit a combined .225. He faced 31 hitters in August and they hit .321 off him. He has battled through shoulder fatigue the last six weeks. Figures to be in the mix for the set-up role next season. Grade: B  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Blaine Hardy: For the second season in a row, Hardy was the Tigers go-to left-hander. He started slowly (six runs in his first six innings) but take away his first four outings and he was 5-3 with 13 holds, a 2.40 ERA with 51 strikeouts in 53.1 innings. He allowed two homers all season. Like Wilson, though, he faltered some in September, probably due to overuse. He has a devastating curveball, one that should keep him in the big leagues for many years to come. Grade: B-minus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Al Alburquerque: They used to call him Every Day Al. Now, it’s Enigmatic Al. He has elite stuff – a mid-90s fastball and a swing-and-miss slider. But because he’s so often erratic, Ausmus was reluctant to pitch him in high-leverage situations. He had four balks and five wild pitches in 62 innings. His ERA (4.33) and WHIP (1.57) are among his career worst. Grade: C  Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News Fullscreen Tom Gorzelanny: At the end of May, his ERA was 1.93. At the end of June, it was 5.06. By the end of July, it was pushing 7.00 and he was DFA’d. Beginning in June, he started tinkering with using a sidearm delivery. He worked on it more in Toledo and since rejoining the Tigers, he’s shown flashes of being effective with the new arm slot. Maybe something positive will come out of his lost season after all. Grade: D  Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News Fullscreen Kyle Ryan: There was a point at the end of July, when it appeared he’d pitched himself out of the Tigers’ future plans. He struggled mightily in his spot starts in Detroit and he was 2-9 at Toledo. But he turned things around in August and seems to have established himself as a key left-handed bullpen piece for 2016. He’s gone back to attacking hitters – throwing his four-seam fastball (90-91) inside to right-handed hitters and his cutter in on lefties – instead of throwing sinkers away and trying to nibble. Grade: C-plus.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Neftali Feliz: The fastball is still consistently in the mid-90s and touching 96, 97 and 98. The slider is still sharp. He still has closer stuff. But, for whatever reason, he got hit around a lot, both in his final days with Texas and when he first came to Detroit. Since Aug. 28, though, he’s allowed three runs in 13.2 innings, with 11 strikeouts and one walk. He is making $4.1 million and will be a free agent this offseason. It will be interesting to see where the bidding starts and if the Tigers are interested. Grade: C  Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News Fullscreen Buy Photo Buck Farmer: The Tigers need to make a decision here – is he a starter or reliever. The organization seems split, though given his struggles as a starter this season, there’s momentum for him being a reliever. His stuff certainly seems better-suited to a bullpen role. He hasn’t developed a weapon to deal with left-handed batters (they hit .391 off him) and he allowed 10 home runs in 38.1 innings. Grade: C-minus.  Robin Buckson, The Detroit News Buy Photo Fullscreen Ian Krol: You get the feeling if he could just get out of his own way, he’d be a stalwart for the Tigers. His stuff is electric, especially now that he’s developed a cutter. But too often he gets over-amped and the game speeds up on him. That’s when he hangs a 0-2 pitch, or hits a batter when he’s ahead in the count, or makes a fielding error. He’s only 24. His work ethic and approach to the game, lacking in 2014, have vastly improved. He’s close to figuring it out. Grade: C-minus.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Drew VerHagen: Another bright spot in an otherwise gloomy season. Finally healthy – chronic back issues have forced him into a bullpen role – he’s been used in some high-leverage situations the last month of the season. And he’s responded well. His fastball is back in the mid-90s and he has a big-breaking curveball that freezes both righties and lefties. His one recurring issue, though, is walks – 17 in 27 innings is too many. Grade: B-minus.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Bruce Rondon: The Tigers drew a firm line in the sand by sending him home with two weeks left in the season. Rondon, 100 mph fastball and all, has struggled to find himself after missing last year with Tommy John surgery and then the first three months this season with biceps tendonitis. Worse, he brooded when he was kept an extra week in Toledo, brooded when Alex Wilson was named closer. And when he got his chance to close, he was erratic and ineffective. Then he seemed to quit – throwing his fastball at 90-93 mph, just going through the motions. It’s on him now to regain the team’s trust. Grade: F  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen CATCHERS -- James McCann: It is the rare and special rookie that can win the respect of a veteran clubhouse as quickly as he did. He earned it with his steady, dependable play (no errors all season), but more so by his relentless work ethic. His defensive acumen, particularly his strong throwing arm, got him to the big leagues. But his ability to hit, call a game and handle pitchers grew by leaps and bounds throughout the season. He’s emerged as one of the true leaders on the team. Grade: B-plus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Alex Avila: Injuries – first the concussions and this year a knee injury – have taken a heavy toll on him as a ballplayer. He hasn’t hit with the same authority since his All-Star season in 2011 -- though his career on-base percentage of .345 is still pretty good. His defense and ability to handle a pitching staff never waned, nor did his professional and personal integrity. If he’s played his last game in a Tigers uniform, it should be remembered that he was a key piece of four straight division championships. Grade: C-minus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen INFIELDERS -- Miguel Cabrera: It seems wrong to say a player closing in on his fourth batting title had an off year. But when your standards of offensive achievement are as high as Cabrera’s, it can happen. His 17 home runs and 74 RBIs are career lows for a full season. Since coming off the DL (he was out for six weeks with a calf strain) in early August, he hit two home runs. Since the injury, he hasn’t seemed able to turn on pitches and pull them with any power. Most of his hits have been to the right side of the field. Still, he’s maintained a .971 OPS and is among the AL leaders in adjusted OPS and on-base plus slugging. Grade: B  Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News Fullscreen Ian Kinsler: Through all the turmoil this season, Kinsler was a rock. He has the highest WAR on the team (6.1) and highest defensive WAR (2.4), according to BaseballReference.com. He ought to win a Silver Slugger award for his production this season. With six games left, he was hitting .300 with 183 hits, ranking in the top 10 in runs, doubles and triples. He made 12 errors, three were throwing errors. His defensive runs saved was a creditable 18. Grade: B-plus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Jose Iglesias: For all the flashy, highlight reel plays he makes, his defensive runs saved is minus-3. So, as talented as he is with the glove, he needs to be better – particularly positioning himself and reacting to balls. He hit .300 this season, better than expected after he missed 2014, and made his first All Star team. But he only played in 120 games. He had a solid three-fourths of a season, but didn’t come close to reaching his full potential. He had just 23 RBIs in 416 at-bats and hit .194 with runners in scoring position and less than two outs. Grade: C  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Nick Castellanos: He endured the worst offensive slump of his life, got benched and wound up turning his season completely around. In terms of growth, the Tigers couldn’t have asked more from Castellanos’ second season. His home run and RBI production was up from his rookie year and his average was about the same – hovering between .250 and .260. He’s shown much better discipline with two strikes, not chasing as many breaking balls out of the zone. His biggest gains were made defensively. His defensive runs saved went from minus-30 to minus-10, according to FanGraphs.com. Still a long way to go, for sure, but the lessons he learned this year should push him forward. Grade: C-plus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Andrew Romine: The Tigers were able to carry an extra pitcher, keeping just three bench players, most of the season largely because of the dependability and versatility of Romine. Playing all four infield positions, plus a few innings in the outfield, he posted 13 defensive runs saved and a 9.1 defensive WAR, according to FanGraphs. He also hit a respectable .266. A very valuable and underappreciated player this season. Grade: B  Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News Fullscreen Victor Martinez (designated hitter): By any measure, and by his own admission, it was the worst year of his career. A .243 average, .364 slugging, 11 home runs, 64 RBI going into the final week – all personal lows for a full season. There were mitigating circumstances. Meniscus surgery on his left knee Feb. 10. He rushed his recovery and never fully regained full strength. He struggled to stay back on his left leg while hitting left-handed. Thus, hitting off his front foot took away his bat speed and power. Even when the knee got stronger, he couldn’t break the bad swing habit. A full offseason and fresh start should help, but he will be 37 next season. Grade: D  Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News Fullscreen Jefry Marte: He can play at the big league level, but perhaps not with the Tigers. As long as Cabrera and Castellanos are healthy, and Romine is around as the super-utility player, there doesn’t appear to be room for him here. But he showed a solid glove, more so at third base than first, and a strong arm. There is also some pop in his bat. He hit 18 home runs between Detroit and Toledo. Grade: C  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Dixon Machado: In his brief time in Detroit, he showed he is a Major League-caliber shortstop. Good range, strong arm, sure hands. He showed enough that the Tigers, at least going into 2016, are not planning on making him a utility player. He will compete with Iglesias for the shortstop position next season. Grade: C  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen OUTFIELDERS -- J.D. Martinez: One-hit wonder? Hardly. Going into the final week of the season, Martinez, who made his first All-Star team, was pushing 40 home runs (38) and exceeded 100 RBIs. His batting average was a healthy .282 with a .880 OPS. Plus, he posted a league-best 15 outfield assists. Aside from his offensive punch, he has made himself into a plus-defender in right field. He is still arbitration eligible, so he stands to get a hefty raise. You wonder if the Tigers will try to lock him up long-term. Grade: A  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Anthony Gose: The question was, can he be the everyday center fielder. The answer seems to be yes. His .253 average is 20 points higher than his career average. He needs to be better against left-handed pitching, but he didn’t face many until Yoenis Cespedes was traded. He also needs to use his exceptional speed more wisely on the bases (caught stealing 11 times in 32 attempts) and in the outfield (minus-12 defensive runs saved). By the end of the season, he looked much more comfortable hitting leadoff. Grade: C-plus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Rajai Davis: He got off to a slow start, partly because he was playing sparingly. Then after the trade deadline, when he got more regular reps, he got hot. He’s hit .269 with six home runs, 17 RBIs and two walk-off hits since Yoenis Cespedes was traded. He also posted a career best 11 triples. He will be 35 next season and he’s a free agent. Given that the Tigers tried (and failed) to move him at the deadline, it doesn’t seem likely they will move to re-sign him. Grade: C-plus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Tyler Collins: He got some extended playing time after the Cespedes trade and he put himself into the mix for an outfield spot in 2016. Whether it’s as the fourth outfielder or the regular left-fielder will depend post-season personnel moves. A left-handed hitter, he has hit left-handed pitchers better than right-handers. The Tigers are still waiting for more consistent power from him (four homers and 11 doubles). He also needs to be more consistent defensively. Grade: C  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen MANAGER -- Brad Ausmus: Between injuries to key personnel, the underperformance of several established players and the worst pitching staff in the American League, the deck was stacked against him. What manager could overcome all of that? What manager can succeed when every time he comes to the mound his options are always the lesser of evils? His in-game management is still a work in progress. But, newsflash, no manager, young or old, has batted 1.000 on his moves in a season. Young players like Anthony Gose, James McCann, Nick Castellanos, Tyler Collins, Alex Wilson, Drew VerHagen and others made developmental gains with this coaching staff. Ausmus never lost the clubhouse and the team continued to play hard, competitive baseball right to the bitter end. Just because you only see his stoic demeanor and his droll post-game interviews, don’t assume a lack of passion and fire. Grade: C-plus  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen INCOMPLETE: Steven Moya, outfield. This was a step-back season for Moya. He got hot late in Toledo and wound up with 20 home runs, but his 162 strikeouts and long stretches of non-production were alarming. He struck out 10 times in 17 plate appearances in his first seven games with the Tigers.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen INCOMPLETE: Bryan Holaday, catcher: A victim of the numbers this season, he made the most of another year in Triple-A. But he’s a big-league catcher and he will most likely come to spring training as the team’s back-up catcher.  Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News Fullscreen INCOMPLETE: Jeff Ferrell, right-handed pitcher: He got knocked around in his brief stint, as many rookies do, but the Tigers like his stuff. He had 16 saves between Double-A and Triple-A this year, and with his 94 mph fastball and swing-and-miss changeup, he struck out 45 in 38.1 minor league innings. He is one of the seven Tigers playing in the Arizona Fall League.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen INCOMPLETE: Josh Wilson, utility: A very useful veteran player. He admirably filled some organizational holes both at Triple-A and in his short duty with the Tigers.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen INCOMPLETE: Jose Valdez, right-handed pitcher: He has the tools to be an effective bullpen piece – 97 mph average four-seamer and an above average slider. But his control and command are spotty. Right now he is more of a thrower than a pitcher.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen Like this topic?
