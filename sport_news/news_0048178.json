On Monday, facing elimination for the second time in 24 hours, the Toronto Blue Jays were finally playing one of their trademark lopsided laughers, full of dingers and fun. Except that with one exception, nobody was laughing. This, from the start, was serious.\nAnd after a pile of sturm and a helping of drang, it worked. The Jays won 8-4, and evened this American League Division Series 2-2. Game 5 will decide it on Wednesday. It wasn’t entirely comfortable, no. But maybe it’s not meant to be.\n“Probably not a relationship-building move,” said Jays manager John Gibbons, wryly, after pulling starter R.A. Dickey after just 78 pitches. “But a team win, that’s what I was looking for.”\nIf you wanted a word to describe this game for Toronto, it was ruthless. They hit like the team that laid waste to baseball in August and September, and it looked like their first real blowout since they clinched the American League East, before the champagne hangover. Dickey was largely in control. David Price, in the bullpen, caught a Kevin Pillar home run and seemed delighted. Rangers fans had nothing left to do but sit in the sun and drink oversized beers and wolf down their cotton candy hot dogs, or their bacon on a stick, or their two-foot deep-fried brownie, or any of the various cardiac events available for sale here, designed to burrow deep into the heart of Texas. Or, Texans.\nAnd with a man on first and two outs in the fifth inning, and a 7-1 lead, Gibbons pulled Dickey for Price, Toronto’s rented ace and Game 1 starter. Price fought his way through three thorny innings, and 50 pitches, and will be available for a batter or two at most in Game 5, no matter what he or Gibbons say. The manager could have let Dickey ride, sure. But he didn’t.\n“I’m an employee, and sometimes you don’t necessarily like what your boss wants you to do,” Dickey said. “But I respect him.”\nIt wasn’t the perfect move, but it was the right one, in the end. Gibbons wasn’t taking a damned chance, not in this game, not on a day that Houston blew up against the Kansas City Royals. There were reasons: Left-handed reliever Brett Cecil is gone, hurt. The only other left-hander in the bullpen, Aaron Loup, left before the game for a family situation. Gibbons saw the left-handed heart of the Texas order coming up, and made the move before he was forced to make the move.\n“You know what, things happen fast,” Gibbons said. “And sometimes, I’ve learned, I’ve watched enough baseball games . . . sometimes the only chance you’ve got to win is you keep the team from coming back.”\nGeneral manager Alex Anthopoulos wholly approved, because the Jays are treating this like the last day of their lives, more or less. They are not taking a single thing for granted.\n“Just win the game,” Anthopoulos said. “We had to win today.”\nAfterwards Dickey and Price shared the podium. Dickey admitted, with admirable honesty, that he wanted to stay in the game, and was taken a little aback when his infielders came to surround him. Price said, “R.A. threw the ball much better than I did.”\nThe Jays say this wasn’t about choosing Marcus Stroman over Price in Game 5, but it was, by omission or otherwise. Stroman was on two days’ rest for this game, but he was better in Game 2 than Price was in Game 1, or has been in his strangely flammable post-season career. (There is a notion floating around the Jays clubhouse that maybe the Rangers knew what pitches were coming with Price). Stroman is the future beating heart of this team, and he deserves to have the season riding on his arm.\nIf Dickey is unhappy, then that’s the cost. If Price is silently shaken, then that’s the cost. If this team is burning some of their slender chances of re-signing Price after this season in exchange for what they need right now — today, not tomorrow, not Game 1 of the ALCS, in which the Star’s Richard Griffin reports Marco Estrada would be the starter — then that’s the cost. When the Jays traded for Price, and burned some of the future for the present, that was this. This, for this franchise, is what going for it looks like.\nSo now they go for it. Stroman on the mound, a building roiling like a cauldron, Wednesday. This has been a great team, and there is no guarantee that it will be this great next season. No, this is about this moment in a franchise’s history, right here, right now. There’s no tomorrow, unless you make sure of it.\nMore on thestar.com\nHome-run kings and pitching aces bring ALDS back to Toronto: Griffin\nBlue Jays’ Chris Colabello continues fairy-tale season", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:58:46.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
