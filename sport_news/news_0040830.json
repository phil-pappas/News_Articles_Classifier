The last straw apparently came when money earned from ticket sales for an African Cup qualifier last month was not accounted for.\nIn South Africa, the main opposition party has called for a criminal investigation into two senior soccer officials after a former FIFA executive pleaded guilty in the U.S. to receiving a bribe from South Africa to vote for it to host the 2010 World Cup.\nAlthough U.S. authorities investigating FIFA have not named the two South African officials they believe were involved, current South African Football Association President Danny Jordaan and former president Molefi Oliphant have been named by the opposition as officials who should be investigated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:10:00.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
