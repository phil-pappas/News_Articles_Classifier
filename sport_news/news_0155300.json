At this point, I simply want to get healthy and back to my normal daily routine on and off the court.\"\nGolden State gave no timeline for his return, saying the top priority is that he gets better.\nKerr, who was born in Beirut, Lebanon, won five NBA championships as a player, including three with the Chicago Bulls.\nHe was chosen in the second round of the 1988 NBA entry draft by the Phoenix Suns and went on to play 910 games with Phoenix, Cleveland, Chicago, Orlando, Portland and San Antonio in 15 seasons.\nGolden State opens the 2015-16 regular season on October 27 at home against the New Orleans Pelicans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:48:49.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
