Altaf, who over the last decade had emerged as one of the best and finest counter-insurgency officers, was joined by another officer and the four in civvies headed to Bandipore with the hope that they would be able to neutralise Qasim and his deputy who were in Bandipore to receive a group of militants believed to have infiltrated recently. During the high-profile operation, Altaf was in touch with senior police officers in Bandipore and Srinagar. Police sources said Altaf had a lead that Qasim was travelling from Hajin to Bandipore to receive a group of militants. Another police party had also laid a small naka on the highway close to Bandipore town. At Gund Dachina on the Srinagar-Bandipore road, 50 km from here, an officer of the rank of Inspector accompanying Altaf came out of his vehicle and directed a suspected pickup van to stop. “The pickup van did not stop immediately and the police officer took out his pistol and warned the driver. However, militants believed to be two in number jumped out of the van and fired indiscriminately with assault rifles at Altaf, who had also come out of the car to confront the militants. Altaf was critically wounded after he was hit in the neck and abdomen,” a police source said. “The three officers had a narrow escape and were not able to fully retaliate,” he added. The militants, including Qasim, sped away in the van. Altaf was airlifted to the Army hospital in Srinagar where he succumbed to his injuries. The top police brass was in a state of shock over Altaf’s death. Massive searches are being carried out in Ajas, Sumbal, Chitti Banidi and Gund-e-Dachin in Bandipore district to trace Qasim. Director General of Police Rajendra Kumar said Altaf always showed exemplary courage. “He had the heart of a lion and intelligence of exceptional nature”. “He had a passion for hard work and launched relentless operations against terrorists in which a number of top terrorists were neutralised during the last decade or so,” he said. “We have lost a repository of knowledge on Kashmir militancy,” said a Senior Superintendent of Police. “The National Investigation Agency would send its officers for training under him,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:19:56.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
