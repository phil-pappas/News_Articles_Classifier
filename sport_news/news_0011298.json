Most of the men available for service are illiterate or otherwise inefficient. Men of literary fitness and suitable character are not attracted by the pay and prospects offered. The result is that in the lower grades of the service, we get men who very often fail to give public satisfaction. The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, referring to the difficulty of recruiting men in the ranks, says that the men-obtained are \"not fit for considerable portion of the duties which they may be called upon to perform.\" The result is inefficiency. Much of the work falls on the ranks and if they are below the standard, the whole department suffers. The public complaints under this circumstances are not unreasonable. The reforms so far effected \"touch only the fringe of the subject.\" A radical revision of the pay and prospects of lower ranks is, says the Chief Commissioner, an urgent necessity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:07:16.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
