(AP Photo/Cathleen Allison)\nRENO, Nev. — For the New Mexico Lobos, Saturday evening wasn’t just a dose of reality.\nIt was the whole batch.\nThe Lobos, thoroughly dominated at the line of scrimmage on defense as well as offense, fell 35-17 to Nevada in a Mountain West Conference football game at Mackay Stadium.\nThe Lobos are all even — 3-3 overall and 1-1 in conference play — and had a two-game win streak snapped.\nNevada is 3-3 and 1-1 as well, but the Wolf Pack was the vastly superior team on Saturday. Running backs James Butler and Don Jackson combined for 307 yards rushing as Nevada rang up 30 first downs. The Lobos had just 14 first downs.\nThe Wolf Pack’s dominance in the running game, UNM coach Bob Davie, was due to a combination of factors — both physical and tactical.\n“(Nevada) came to the realization that if they were gonna give us a short edge that we were gonna blitz and make plays,” he said.\n“If they could line up with two tight ends on us and just man us up and make us play, they were gonna have success. They did.”\nBut the Lobos aided the Nevada cause, Davie said, by missing far too many tackles.\nThe run-based UNM offense, meanwhile, didn’t come close to matching Nevada’s onslaught. The Lobos, who entered the game averaging 290 yards rushing per game, managed a season-low 125 yards.\nNew Mexico had only one play, rushing or passing, longer than 38 yards — a touchdown run by Teriyon Gipson that gave the Lobos a short-lived 10-7 lead in the second quarter. Nevada outgained the Lobos 517-273.\nDavie compared the Lobos’ problems running the ball to the Tulsa game earlier this year. Like the Golden Hurricane in a 40-21 UNM loss on Sept. 12, the Wolf Pack controlled the inside rush with two big interior defensive linemen.\n“Against the good teams, we’re not yet able to consistently run that ball up in there,” Davie said.\nBut, with rare exceptions, nor did the Lobos have any success against Nevada on the option keep and pitch.\n“I think (Nevada) had a really good scheme, and they really played hard,” Lobos tight end Reece White said. “We had chances to make some plays, and we just didn’t end up capitalizing at the end of the day.”\nNew Mexico linebackers Dakota Cox and Kimmie Carson, meanwhile, were in on just seven tackles as the Nevada offense controlled the middle of the field.\n“They adjusted to the defense we were running,” said UNM cornerback Cranston Jones, who was in on eight tackles. “They knew where the blitzes were coming from. … Once we adjusted, we did better. But we still didn’t make as many plays as we needed to.”\nIn the fourth quarter, with UNM trailing 28-17, Davie replaced sophomore quarterback Lamar Jordan with junior Austin Apodaca. The Lobos drove from their 25-yard line to the Nevada 11, with Apodaca completing seven of eight passes.\nBut on the next play, slot receiver Dameon Gamblin caught an Apodaca pass but was hit, fumbled at the 1-yard\nNew Mexico’s Dameon Gamblin (2) reaches for the end zone against Nevada’s Asauni Rufus (2) at an NCAA college football game in Reno, Nev., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015.

White recovered for UNM at the Wolf Pack 25, and Rogers hit a 42-yard field goal three plays later.\nNew Mexico caught another huge break when, on the first play of the fourth quarter, Nevada quarterback Tyler Stewart fumbled. The ball bounced into the hands of UNM cornerback Nias Martin, who returned the fumble 77 yards for a touchdown — cutting the Wolf Pack’s lead to 21-17.\nIt took Nevada just four plays, however, to go back ahead by two scores.\nWhatever chance New Mexico might have had, given those breaks and given Nevada’s dominance, was blown up by UNM mistakes.\nThe Lobos, down 14-10 in the third quarter, appeared to have converted a fourth-and-2 situation on a Jordan run to the Nevada 37. But UNM offensive guard Aaron Jenkins was called for a chop block. The Lobos were forced to punt.\nAfter Martin’s touchdown fumble return, UNM appeared to have stopped Nevada on a third-and-8 from the Lobos’ 23. But Martin was called for pass interference in the end zone, and the Wolf Pack scored on the next play to go up 28-17.\nBox Score – Game 06 – Nevada 35, New Mexico 17", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GuYNupiddw?feature=oembed", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Box-Score-Game-06-Nevada-35-New-Mexico-171.pdf", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Mexico-Nevada-Football-400x267.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Mexico-Nevada-Gamblin-Football-400x261.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Mexico1-Nevada-Football-400x600.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:09:47.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
