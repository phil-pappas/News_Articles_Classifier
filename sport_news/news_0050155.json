The defense was porous and seemingly a step behind. And early on, the energy was lacking. \n\"Just about everything our team has to improve,\" said coach Lionel Hollins, whose team opens the regular season at home Oct. 28 against Chicago. \"We have to be better defensively. We have to be better attacking the basket. … Just being more comfortable with being aggressive and playing — and not thinking and trying to be perfect — but just playing the game.\" \nThe Nets trailed by as many as 17 points in the first half despite their three best players — Brook Lopez (12 points), Joe Johnson (eight) and Thaddeus Young (17) — playing significant minutes. If that was alarming, the third quarter was encouraging as Brooklyn rallied and showed flashes of promise with Lopez, Johnson and Young combining to score 24 of the team's 28 points. \nThen there's the confusing: Veteran guard Jarrett Jack was ejected for a hard foul — one that could leave him open to suspension. \nWith 9:56 remaining in the second quarter, Jack gave up the ball on a steal, starting a Boston fast break. Chasing from behind, Jack lowered his shoulder into Jonas Jerebko, knocking the Celtic to the floor and making no attempt at the ball. \nIt was an old-school playoff foul in a preseason game. After review, it was ruled a flagrant two and Jack was automatically ejected. \n\"It was a frustration foul,\" Jack said. \"And I did a little more than I intended to do. … But I thought the ref did make the proper call.\" \nNow he'll have to wait and see if the league office suspends him. \n\"I hope not,\" Jack said. \"I didn't mean to do that, actually. It was a little bit of heat of the moment, a litlte bit of frustration more than anything, and my intention wasn't to do that at all.\" \nBRIEFS: Andrea Bargnani, who missed the first three preseason games with what the team called a \"tight hamstring,\" also missed Wednesday's game. Bargnani practiced in full Tuesday, but Hollins wouldn't say if the 7-footer had a setback or if this was just part of the medical staff's plan. \n\"I talked to [the trainer] and he said he's still not ready to go,\" Hollins said. \nBargnani was on the court before the game and moved well during a lengthy shooting session. \nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:51:18.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
