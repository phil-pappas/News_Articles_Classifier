Once again they are going to bring guns to a place where women and kids pray to god…Fuck these clowns and the message they spread,” the group says on Facebook.\nOther counter-protesters are calling on their “fellow humans [to] rise up against hatred wherever we find it [because] our world needs to be safe for all people of every religion, color, and economic background.”\nRelated Stories Phoenix's Jon Ritzheimer Plans Global Anti-Islam Protest Anti-Islam Activist Jon Ritzheimer Reported to FBI Confederate \"Stand By the Flag\" Rally at Walmart Got Heated Ritzheimer’s Global Rally has been strongly condemned by the Council on American and Islamic Relations , the largest Muslim civil rights organization in the country. CAIR leaders have called on elected officials to publicly speak out against the demonstrations and have encouraged the greater American Muslim community to be extra vigilant this weekend:\n“Media reports and monitoring of anti-Muslim hate sites indicate that a small group of anti-Muslim extremists with a history of violent rhetoric are attempting to organize hate rallies outside a number of mosques across the nation on October 10. Organizers of the hate rallies have indicated that participants in states with open carry laws may be armed and that provocations such as the use of live pigs and Quran desecrations may occur.\n“The anti-Islam rallies come at a time of increased hate-motivated crimes and bias incidents nationwide targeting persons and property associated, or perceived to be associated, with Islam and the American Muslim community,\" the group writes in a statement.\nScreenshot/Facebook Sergeant Trent Crump tells New Times in an e-mail that the Phoenix Police Department is “aware of the event planning at this point, but will not comment about any of our security plans.”\nBased on the PPD response last time, in which dozens of officers in riot gear patrolled the scene, breaking up fights and successfully preventing any violence, attendees can expect a large law enforcement presence.\nIn recent days, The Global Rally for Humanity Facebook page has been inundated by commenters condemning the rally and claiming it's canceled. But in a video posted to Facebook last night, Ritzheimer and two of his friends/fellow anti-Islam enthusiasts — Saad Kooza Salman and Blaine Cooper — assure their followers that tomorrow's rally is still on.\nBREAKING!
