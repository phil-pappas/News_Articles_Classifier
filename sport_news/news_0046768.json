There are six senior receivers on the roster this season, and they were quick to lend words of advice as Ball State prepared for Saturday’s game at Northern Illinois. \n“Those guys are always here for me,” Neal said. “They’re all football savvy, and they’ve been doing this for a long time with this offense … Football stuff, it can help a lot for a young guy coming in.” \nNeal missed some throws against Toledo. He looked like a freshman at times. But he’s ready to step it up against the Huskies, and he’s leaned on some of his veteran teammates for support, on and off the field. \nDespite those struggles, Neal has yet to throw an interception this season. That’ll be key against a Northern Illinois defense that has already picked off opposing offenses nine times. One guy head coach Pete Lembo is keeping an eye on is sophomore cornerback Shawun Lurry. \n“He’s already got five interceptions so far this year,” Lembo said. “So he’s got as many interceptions alone as most teams have in total.” \nSenior receiver Jordan Williams is a 6-foot-3 playmaker that can go up and outmuscle opposing cornerbacks. His size and athleticism help him get open on plays when it looks like he won’t even be close to the ball. Despite his attributes, Williams has never been Ball State’s clear-cut No. 1 receiving option. \nTwo years ago his 72 catches for 1,050 yards were overshadowed by Willie Snead’s 106 grabs for 1,516 yards. Snead, now in the NFL, has 16 receptions and 240 yards this season for the New Orleans Saints. Last year, Williams and KeVonn Mabon essentially split the load with 56 and 59 receptions, respectively. \nOver the last two games, though, Williams has looked like that clear-cut No. 1 receiving option. He put up 100 yards last week and 133 yards two weeks ago. The numbers are starting to stack up, and Williams is about to crack the top-5 in every major Ball State career receiving number. \nBut he’s not focused on those lists. \n“I try not to look at it,” Williams said. “I focus on getting better and doing everything better. If I do that, everything will take care of itself.” \nHe was frustrated following a 24-10 loss against Toledo. He stooped down in his chair during the press conference, giving short answers and generally keeping a low profile. Though he did have a strong showing, his first half was pretty subpar. \n“It’s more about capitalizing on plays early,” Williams said. “Obviously it hurts to miss out on plays, but I’m sure after working on it a little, we’ll make them.” \nNeal says he’s working mostly on the mental side of things, making reads and learning how to read defenses. He and Williams have been talking too, sometimes just to talk. Sometimes it's making a quick joke, and getting a feel for the other guy’s personality. \n“He’s still learning, and I’m still learning how to adapt to him,” Williams said. “The more we do that, the better we’ll get.” \nFollow Ball State sports reporter Dakota Crawford on Twitter @DakotaCrawford_ .
