(Lee Jin-man / AP) Associated Press \nThe United States held off an inspired rally Sunday to win the Presidents Cup for the sixth straight time, this one decided by the final match. \nThe Americans got the winning point from Bill Haas, the son of U.S. captain Bill Haas, who won 2-up over an emotionally distraught Bae Sang-moon. Bae needed to win the final hole for the International team to share the cup, but he stubbed a chip. \nThe Americans won 15 1/2-14 1/2, the closest competition in 10 years. \nThe tense final session was just what this competition needed, though it didn't feel that way to the International team. It looked like the International team had control until Chris Kirk holed a 15-foot putt on the 18th, and Anirban Lahiri lost the hole by missing a 4-foot putt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:29:03.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
