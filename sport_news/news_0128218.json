The Giants have not thrown the ball down the field much, and when they have the results have not been there. They are hoping that changes Sunday night against a 49ers secondary that gives up big plays.\n“I think, in general, we haven’t been as clean outside the numbers as we’d like to be,’’ offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo said. “It’s not the quarterback, it’s not Odell, it’s not Rueben [Randle], it’s just a combination of everything, and that’s something we’re working at right now to get better at.’’\nChris Snee and Osi Umenyiora, who filled prominent roles in the victories in Super Bowl XLII and XLVI, will enter the Giants’ Ring of Honor during a halftime ceremony — along with former athletic trainer John Johnson, who is 98, and Jack Lummus, who played for the Giants in 1941 and was killed in World War II.\nRookie DE Owa Odighizuwa played more than expected (47 defensive snaps) in his NFL debut last week coming off a foot injury. With Robert Ayers and George Selvie out for this game, figure Odighizuwa gets plenty of action vs. the 49ers.\n“He was really solid,’’ defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said. “He’s got a ways to go. I can tell he was just getting his feet under him because his pass rush isn’t quite where it was in training camp at one point. But I think he’ll improve and keep getting better.’’\nThe 49ers have won five consecutive road games against NFC East opponents. … Niners LT Joe Staley (knee) did not practice all week and is questionable. … LB Ahmad Brooks reportedly will not play after the death of his older sister from complications of lupus. Second-year player Corey Lemonier would start in place of Brooks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:12:32.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
