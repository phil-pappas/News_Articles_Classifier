He participated in some team drills for the first time since suffering a sprained left knee Sept. 21 at Indianapolis.\nBuy this photo He made the trip to London with the Jets, but it’s unclear whether he will be able to play against Miami on Sunday.\n\"I’m up in the air right now,\" coach Todd Bowles said of Decker’s status for the game. \"I’ve got to see him do a little more, but he was limited [Thursday] so that was encouraging.\"\nDecker sat out the loss to Philadelphia, as did running back Chris Ivory (quadriceps). The absence of both severely hampered the offense. Ivory practiced full Thursday and it appears he will play Sunday, barring a setback.\n\"When he’s healthy, he gives us a spark, hopefully,\" Bowles said of Ivory. \"We’ve just got to open holes regardless of who is back there.\"\nSoft turf? \nThe natural-grass field at Wembley Stadium has been rather soft for some of the NFL games played there. In fact, when Detroit beat Atlanta there last season, groundskeepers were replacing divots in the field at halftime.\n\"It’s probably going to be a little wet,\" kicker Nick Folk said, \"not as tight as our grass fields here [in America]. It’s probably not going to be able to handle 300-pound linemen. It’s made for 160- to 180-pound soccer players.\"\nFolk said he isn’t worried.\n\"I guess they’ve done some work to try to help it out,\" he said, \"but we’ve just got to see what we get on Sunday. I’ll just go in and take a shoe that’s going to work.\"\nBriefs \nCB Darrelle Revis (hamstring) practiced on a limited basis for the second straight day. He is likely to play Sunday. … TE Jeff Cumberland (concussion) didn’t make the trip. The Jets promoted undrafted free agent TE Wes Saxtonfrom the practice squad. … OLB Trevor Reilly (finger infection) traveled with the team, but is unlikely to play.\n— J.P.
