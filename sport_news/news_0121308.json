The programme will be implemented in collaboration with the culture, solidarity and youth ministry.\nEU projects in Upper Egypt have for decades focussed on development efforts, because of the widespread poverty and lack of basic rights.\nHowever the idea of using culture as a gateway to development could appeal more to the youth and have a greater impact on Upper Egypt culture and development.\nThe initiative's key idea is employing Egypt's vivid cultural diversity to support social dialogue, according to head of the EU Egypt delegation James Moran\nArtistic expression can help form a sense of identity and self-esteem, particularly for young people looking to the future.\nThe project starts in January with a budget of â‚¬ 263,500. Initially the focus will be on training community cultural leaders in areas like choir, drama, poetry and drawing, and a cultural centre will be built in the village of Hegaza.\nThe project, which will also offer grants to artistic groups participating in cultural competitions, coincides with AUEED's 75th birthday. .\nAUEED is known for leading cultural development through arts and crafts and choir initiatives that bring together Upper Egypt's finest voices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:49:44.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
