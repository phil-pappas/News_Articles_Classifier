Center on Saturday, providing another glimpse of where the squad stands about two weeks into preseason practices. \nNot really sure it matters which team won, but here are five quick takeaways from the workout: \nDeng Adel needs minutes — lots of them: He still has work to do on his jump shot, but freshman forward Deng Adel is far too effective to keep him on the bench, not that I think Louisville plans to. I know coach Rick Pitino believes that, too. He has said several times this offseason that he likes a lineup that pairs Adel with 6-foot-6 grad transfer Damion Lee on the wings. At 6-7, 200 pounds, Adel is the team's most versatile player. He can rebound, finish around the basket and in transition, he runs the floor well and he's a solid passer. In the eyes of Pitino and the players, Adel is the team's best defender. He is already the strongest player as a freshman, with some serious chops in the weight room, according to Lee. He does so many little things that add up to stuffed box scores, and he can guard three positions. I've seen him play nine times now, and he has never not impressed me in some way. \nHe finished with 35 points (12-18 FG), nine rebounds and six assists today. Spalding out for Louisville's Red-White game \nDamion Lee's the guy: As if U of L needed any confirmation, Lee showed again Saturday why he will be the team's go-to scorer. He was a constant threat from distance, and he got to the foul line on his drives (8-10 FT). He totaled 33 points from 10-of-20 shooting. But something that won't get mentioned nearly as often as his scoring is how well he does some other vital things. Lee had double-digit rebounds (13) today and even guarded the opposing power forward for long stretches of time. His matchup against 7-footer Anas Mahmoud made for some solid entertainment. Lee's main responsibility will be putting points on the board, but he has translated some of his other attributes to this team, too. \nMangok Mathiang's return: He missed the first scrimmage, so Saturday offered the first chance to see 6-10 redshirt junior Mangok Mathiang since the Puerto Rico trip. He showed off a much-improved offensive game in August, but he struggled with his touch around the basket on a few occasions this time around. That said, he was active as usual — and talkative as usual. He was the most effective scorer among the big men and got his hands on quite a few passes and shot attempts. It was a quality return for the team's vocal leader, with 15 points (5-9 FG), eight rebounds, four steals and two blocks. \nChinanu Onuaku's struggles: As much as Mathiang's presence was felt, Onuaku's was not. He looked so much better during the Puerto Rico trip, and the coaches say he is doing very well in practices, but in the two public scrimmages, Onuaku has looked a lot like his old self. He appears to be out of gas on too many possessions, and that leads to a handful of silly, lazy fouls or mistakes. At one point, Onuaku simply held onto Matz Stockman instead of trying to get into position and defend him. He collected eight fouls in the last scrimmage, and he matched that on Saturday, with nine fouls (and seven turnovers to go with them). Gotta think a lot of it is conditioning, but there still has to be a mental aspect of it, too. He can't give away possessions and fouls because of fatigue, even in scrimmages, especially when Jaylen Johnson and Ray Spalding are making such strides and Mathiang is a proven commodity. Big Board 3.0: Louisville hoops 2016 recruiting \nThe freshman impact: I already mentioned Adel, who deserved his own bullet point, but here's a good spot for Donovan Mitchell, another freshman who played well on Saturday, at least in spurts. He put his seemingly effortless athleticism on display in the warmups, making 360 dunks and windmills look like a stroll in a park. In the game, his quickness disrupted quite a few possessions, including one play in the first half where he simply snatched the ball out of Quentin Snider's hands. Ray Spalding sat out today because of an ankle sprain, and his absence was obvious, too. He is so athletic and long, and not having him out there left Louisville without that uber-athletic presence in the frontcourt. You can see why Pitino raves about his freshmen at every turn. \nOne for the road: An extra thought here — Quentin Snider deserves credit for the work he's put into his jump shot. It was a line drive last season, and he was far more effective driving to the basket and operating in tight spaces around the bucket. But he has worked hard on the loft under his shot, and he is, as Pitino would say, shooting at a bigger rim now with a better trajectory on his shot. 2 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1ROKikP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:41:12.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
