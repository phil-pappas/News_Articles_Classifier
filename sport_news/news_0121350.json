Should I charge her for the repairs? —Neta\nYou shouldn’t, for two reasons. To see this problem in a more general way, let’s assume that the culprit wasn’t your baby sitter and that the object in question wasn’t your car. Instead, let’s imagine that you had lent your neighbor your electric drill and it broke while he was hanging a picture. He might offer to pay for the drill, but if he didn’t, would you ask him to pay for it? Probably not. You would understand that wear and tear happens, that the breakage probably wasn’t your neighbor’s fault and that the drill eventually would have broken anyway.\nIn contrast, when people have car accidents, we’re quick to blame them—but from time to time, accidents just happen, through no fault of the drivers. Maybe this is a good opportunity to accept the accident as part of the normal wear and tear on the car.\nThere’s also another reason why you shouldn’t ask the baby sitter to pay: She’s your baby sitter, and though she might be a very trustworthy teenager, you were the one who decided to let her use the car. It’s best to own up to that responsibility.\nDear Dan,\nI’m planning to hire a professional clothing stylist to study my body type and style and advise me on which clothes to keep and which to give away. I’m considering two options: first, asking her to take all the clothes she doesn’t approve of out of my closet, and second, to first take everything out and then put back the things she thinks pass muster. Which approach would you recommend? —Maria\nYou’re right to suspect that the two methods will probably result in different outcomes. The reason is the “status quo bias”—the tendency to leave things as they are. If you start with all the clothes in the closet, the effort required to keep items there is lower than the effort required to take them out, which means that fewer clothes will end up being given away. On the other hand, if you start with all your clothes out of the closet, the lower-effort course involves leaving clothes where they are, which means more things will end up being given away.\nBut you’re unlikely to apply the status quo bias evenly to your whole wardrobe: The clothes that are clearly great will probably stay with you regardless of your method, and the clothes that are just awful will probably be given away either way too. The difference will come with the “Goldilocks clothes”—the ones that fall somewhere between those two clear categories. The real question is how many of these Goldilocks clothes you want to keep.\nTwo more points: If you don’t fully trust the stylist, you might start with the “all clothes in” approach, take fewer risks and keep more of the Goldilocks clothes. Also, some clothes will have sentimental value even if someone else thinks they look awful on you—so keep them. After all, we dress for ourselves, not just for other people.\nDear Dan,\nWhat is the best example of human irrationality? —Bill\nI must admit that I’ve never understood why the most important medical center in the world, the Mayo Clinic, is conveniently located in balmy Rochester, Minn. I deeply appreciate the care they’ve given me—but it’s a long trip.\n—Prof. Ariely’s “Irrationally Yours,” a book based on this column, was recently published by HarperCollins (which, like The Wall Street Journal, is owned by News Corp).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:19:51.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
