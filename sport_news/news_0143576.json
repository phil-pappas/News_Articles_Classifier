Hamann was inducted to the Colorado Motorsports Hall of Fame on Oct. 14. ( Photo courtesy of Chuck and Margie Hamann ) \nThere has to be at least as much motor oil and fuel in Charles Hamann's system as there is blood. \nHow could there not be? The man people know as \"Chuck\" has been around cars and engines his entire life. His dad was a mechanic and Hamann worked in his father's garage by the time he was 14. Shoot, he built his first dragster his senior year of high school. \nMore than 50 years of his life was spent building and racing machines that had one goal: go as fast as possible. \nHamann retired from racing in 2002 and moved to Loveland nine years ago, but at 75, is still remembered for his contributions to the motorsports community. On Oct. 14, Hamann was recognized for all time as an inductee to the 2015 Colorado Motorsports Hall of Fame class. \n\"I was honored. If you look at past inductees, there aren't that many drag racers that have been inducted,\" he said. \"They're more pro-stock car racing, NASCAR, Indy Car, stuff like that, so I was surprised. It was indeed an honor and quite a ceremony.\" \nHamann was honored at the Vehicle Vault in Parker, where each inductee (11 total) received a medal and admiration from their peers, including Hamann's longtime friend John Bandimere, Jr. \nHowever, maybe the biggest thrill was the location, which he had never heard of before that day, but will certainly not soon forget. \n\"I wasn't even aware of the Vehicle Vault where they had the induction ceremony. It's a pretty amazing building. Somebody has a fantastic auto collection there,\" he says with just a subtle hint of envy in his voice. \nOver his career, Hamann built and raced dragsters starting in 1959 with his first, a 1927 Ford Roadster, before making his mark by racing a \"straight-eight\" Buick engine as opposed to the far more popular Ford. \nBut the results were unquestionable as Hamann built his own manifolds and parts to win the 1961 Wy-Neb-Co Championship with more wins than any other car in the three-state area. \nHe also won the National Hot Rod Association West Central Division Championship in 1962 as the National Top Speed Champion despite losing high gear on the final race. His roadster was named on of the \"Top Ten Cars\" in the United States in 1962 and 63. \nAccolades continued throughout his career, and Hamann even taught automotive mechanics at Morgan Community College in the 1970s before serving on the Fort Morgan City Council (including mayor pro-tem in 1985). \n\"The list is long every year; everybody who makes it has done a lot for the sport and given a lot back to Colorado. We really try to select people that have done a lot of racing and for Colorado motorsports,\" said Colorado Motorsports Hall of Fame chairman Scott Backman. \"Chuck is one of those guys who did a lot for Colorado. He was really worthy of going in. People like John Bandimere have followed Chuck and knew about him. It was pretty easy to know he was one of the guys that should represent the 2015 class.\" \nAs for Hamann, he never even thought about a motorsports hall of fame much less being an exclusive member. Racers only ever think about one thing. \n\"Oh heavens no,\" he said. \"All you're interested in is wining races.\" \nCris Tiller: 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/cristiller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:30:39.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
