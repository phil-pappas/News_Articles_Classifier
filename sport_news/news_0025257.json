(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones says Kentucky can beat Auburn Thursday night. \nWhen I saw UK's football schedule at the beginning of the year, there were two games I thought would be very difficult for the Wildcats. At Georgia and Auburn at home, those teams seemed probably too good for Mark Stoops team in his third year, but I was wrong. Both of those team have had difficulties and Auburn especially is now beatable. \nThe Cats play them Thursday night in a game that might see Commonwealth Stadium as hyped as I can ever remember it.It's the first time Kentucky has played a Thursday night game since 1939, and everywhere I go people talk about the excitement of going to the game and the atmosphere. \nAnd this Auburn team is very, very beatable. They simply don't have a quarterback. And in today's college football, if you don't have a great quarterback, you have a hard time winning. \nIf Kentucky can win this game, all of a sudden bowls of a higher level are on the table. You can start seeing Kentucky having a New Year's Day bowl or even better. But they've got to get this one. Auburn is beatable and this is the year to get them, and I think Kentucky's going to do it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:56:28.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
