(AP) — Georgia receiver Isaiah McKenzie has apologized for being involved in an incident that led to police being called to an Athens restaurant. \nThe sophomore issued a statement Friday through the school saying he wanted to “sincerely apologize to everyone.” McKenzie also says he is “relieved to have put this behind me.” \nThe player was alleged to have made “terroristic threats” against a woman at a Chili’s restaurant Monday night. No charges were filed, and Athens-Clarke County police say the alleged victim decided not to pursue the case. \nMcKenzie is expected to play Saturday when the No. 8 Bulldogs host No. 13 Alabama is a crucial Southeastern Conference game. He has five catches for 89 yards, along with two carries for 32 yards.
