Austin Dutko scored five touchdowns as the Falcons overwhelmed Crossroads Academy 43-6 Friday night for that first win of the season. Dutko rushed for 239 yards on 13 carries in leading the young and banged up FCW club. It was a game that also allowed for a number of players a chance to hit the field. Kyle Voytko added 67 yards on the ground and caught two passes for 26 yards. Brady Sember had two receptions for 45 yards and a TD and Chandler Hillebrenner threw for 71 yards and a touchdown. FCW scored in a variety of ways in this night. Dutko got the Falcons on the board with a 6-yard run and Hillebrenner connected with Sember for a 36-yard score. The defense got into the act when Bryce Welch recorded a safety. Dutko added scoring runs of 58, 9 and 55 yards before Crossroads got on the board. It didnâ€™t take long for the Falcons get that score back as Dutko raced 81 yards with the kickoff for a touchdown. FCW (1-7) will host Tremont in its season finale next Friday.
