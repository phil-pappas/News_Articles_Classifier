Rader, 33-2 in 2015, has never lost a regular season match. The state tournament, she said, comes with added pressure. \n“It’s such a different setting from the regular season,” Rader said. \nRader lost a semifinal match to defending state champion Yurie Heard of Pembroke Hill. Heard went on to make it back-to-back titles by defeating Ashley Dowden of Helias Catholic for the championship. Rader shrugged off the 6-1, 6-0 loss to Heard. \n“Yurie is a great player, I mean, she has beautiful strokes. I knew that was going to be a tough match,” Rader said. \nThe third place match with Villa Duchesne’s Riley Clarke was frustrating. Both players stuck to their baselines and tried to force their opponent to make mistakes. It was the tennis equivalent to two counterpunching boxers going 10 rounds. “It’s weird, it’s almost like trying to find your own weaknesses and use them against the opponent,” Rader said. “We used to play against each other years ago, but we haven’t met again until now, so it was interesting to see how we both have improved our game.” \nClarke took the win 6-4, 6-3. \nRader’s fourth-place finish represents an improvement from her sixth-place finish at the state tournament as a freshman. \n“My goal this year was to get to the semis. I wanted to be in the top four this year,” Rader said. “Everything else was almost like a bonus, I had nothing to lose.” Buy Photo \nSpringfield Catholic junior Emily Kroutil placed fifth in the state in Class 1 singles at Cooper Tennis Complex Oct. 16-17.

Rader looked on as her regular season doubles partner come from behind to beat Bhaskar 4-6, 6-4, 6-2. \n“We’ve always supported each other,” Rader said of Kroutil. \nWhitney Wiehe and Abby Rinker of Mt. Vernon placed eighth in Class 1 doubles. \nGlendale junior Rachel Dwyer made her second trip to the state tournament memorable with an eighth-place finish in Class 2 singles. Dwyer picked up her first two state tournament match wins. \n“My goal this year was just to win one match, and I got two. It makes me really happy that I medaled, even though it’s not fifth or sixth place,” Dwyer said.

A loss to Bridget Mayfield of Kirkwood placed Dwyer in the consolation bracket, where she was forced to play her Falcons teammate Brooke Smith. Dwyer beat Smith 6-2, 6-0. \n“It was rough. It made it awkward, I feel like. I love her so much. I felt bad,” Dwyer said. \nDwyer took the win and ended up taking a second loss to Mayfield Saturday in the seventh place match. 1 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1LAEMl7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:45:05.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
