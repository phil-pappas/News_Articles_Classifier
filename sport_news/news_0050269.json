(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) × COLUMBA — Before returning home from a team-building trip to the Charleston area this past weekend, head coach Dawn Staley ensured her South Carolina women’s basketball squad made one special last stop — Emanuel AME Church. The Gamecocks on Sunday visited the sanctuary where nine people were slain June 17 during a shooting at a bible study. “I want our players to be appreciative of life, because nine people lost their lives in that church, and it affected so many people,” Staley said Monday. “I wanted us to take a moment of silence for the people who lost their lives, but also let (USC’s players) know — they’re in a fortunate positon to breathe fresh air, something the nine (victims) have been robbed of. So don’t take it for granted. Don’t take it for granted.” The effects of the shootings were felt in Columbia, where the Confederate flag was removed from the Statehouse grounds and the USC football team is wearing a decal on their helmets this season to honor the victims. The alleged shooter, Dylann Roof, is a native of the Columbia area. Staley’s team was in the Charleston area for a weekend of activities which included an open practice Saturday at Goose Creek High School. During the church visit, her players were “very quiet, and kind of took in the moment,” she said. “That was my first time visiting the church since it happened, and I think that was their first time visiting the church,” Staley added. “But it allowed them to kind of exhale and take in the moment and be thankful for all the things that they have in their lives, their family members, and realize the magnitude of what took place.” Senior guard Tiffany Mitchell said Staley “wanted to teach us a lesson, to just be thankful for what we have.” South Carolina, which went a program-best 34-3 last season and reached its first Final Four, is preparing for a 2015-16 campaign which opens Nov. 13 with a home game against Ohio State. Emanuel AME was the team’s last stop before returning to Columbia. “It put things in perspective for all of us,” Staley said. “What we’re doing is pretty small compared to what the city of Charleston went through a couple of months ago.” Notes — Mitchell, who had offseason surgery to repair a stress injury in her left foot, has not yet been cleared to practice. “I probably have another couple of weeks,” the first-team All-American said Monday, USC’s media day. “But it’s getting better each day. It’s nothing that should hold me back for a while. As long as I see progress, that’s the biggest thing right now.” — USC has sold over 10,000 season tickets for the upcoming women’s basketball season, a new record. The Gamecocks led the nation last season with an average paid home attendance of 12,293. “It’s truly amazing how this community has supported our program,” Staley said. “It just shows we put a great product on the floor they can be proud of, and they can feel good about making us a part of their budget.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:56:46.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
