Petrino added that he has zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior toward women. \nPolice in Moscow, Idaho, say the alleged incident occurred in nearby Pullman, Washington, early Sunday morning. \nPullman police said no arrest had been made and declined to comment further. \nEpps has 61 receptions for 757 yards in six games this season, far and away the most among Idaho receivers. \nBut the senior has had a troubled career at Idaho, being disciplined several times before for breaking team rules.
