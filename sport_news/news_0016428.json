(AP) The Los Angeles Lakers have hired Tracy Murray as a shooting coach. \nThe Lakers announced the move Thursday night. \nMurray is a Los Angeles native who played at UCLA and enjoyed a 12-year NBA career largely on the stretch of his exceptional outside shot. He will work with coach Byron Scott to improve technique with the Lakers, who finished last season with the worst record in franchise history at 21-61. \nScott describes Murray as ''one of the purest shooters I've ever seen.'' \nMurray was a two-time all-Pac-10 player at UCLA and a first-round NBA draft pick. He played for Portland, Houston, Toronto, Washington, Denver and the Lakers before playing in Greece and France. \nHe spent the past eight seasons as a radio color analyst for UCLA men's and women's basketball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:39:18.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
