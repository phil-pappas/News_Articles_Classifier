The Bears (7-0, 4-0) had 485 total yards, leaving them well below their national-leading averages of 64 points and 720 total yards a game.\nBaylor led 35-0 by the middle of the second quarter before going more than 35 minutes — the equivalent of more than a full half — without a single point.\n“A tough win, but I think it was a win we needed,” Briles said. “You hate to say that, you’d like for everything to be like it’s been. It’s not going to be that way, it’s not reality. I thought our guys did a great job of just kind of sustaining, and maintaining, and not panicking and just taking care of business.”\nBaylor finished the game without quarterback Seth Russell , who sustained a strained neck on a 4-yard run without about 5½ minutes left. The extent of the injury wasn’t known, though there is extra time before the next game.\n(14) Oklahoma State 58, Kansas 10: In Stillwater, Oklahoma, backup quarterback J.W. Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more to lead the Cowboys (7-0, 4-0), hours after a fatal crash near the stadium during the school’s homecoming festivities. Four were killed and dozens more were injured. Mason Rudolph completed 20 of 26 passes for 305 yards and had a touchdown. Kansas (0-7, 0-4) lost its 10th straight game and 36th straight on the road.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846417/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846417/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846414/3/920x920.jpg", "https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846412/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846412/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846415/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846414/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846416/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846415/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846413/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846413/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/61/8846416/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:19:44.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
