Ball State (2-3, 0-1) is in a similar situation, entering Saturday's matchup — known as the the Battle for the Bronze Stalk — on a three-game losing skid. \"Behind that whole thing is disappointment, upset, whatever word you want to attach to it,\" Carey said. \"Both teams are going to feel that.\" Ball State is now being led by freshman quarterback Riley Neal, who has 740 yards passing with four touchdowns and no interceptions. The 6-foot-5, 217-pounder also has 217 yards rushing with a TD. NIU doesn't intend on making wholesale changes to try and stop him, however. They'll still to what they do well. \"We're still the same team here,\" cornerback Paris Logan said. \"Things happen. It's just up to us to change it right now.\" Jay Taft: 815-987-1384; jtaft@rrstar.com ; @JayTaft", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:57:56.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
