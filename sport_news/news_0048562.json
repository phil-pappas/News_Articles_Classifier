He narrated how he went about his task in the 50th over of India s innings.\n\"I have never felt more pressure in the game than today. Simply because of magnitude of the players and level of cricket. The fans, the big game, it was very emotional,\" Rabada said at the post match press conference.\n\"I was speaking to AB (de Villiers) at that time and I said to AB 'listen we have been bowling back of a length all this while, that has been the plan so what do you think?'. He said 'no' because MS can pounce on those full balls. The plan was very great and it worked out great.\n\"Pitched back of a length and we felt it was harder and harder to bat as the day progressed. It was a two paced wicket. We were clear in the last over about what to do.\nAdjusted well in the conditions and it paid off,\" said Rabada, who has quickly earned the praise of his teammates after making his T20 debut in November and ODI debut as recent as July when he took a hat-trick against Bangladesh in his first 50 over appearance.\nRabada was exhausted after his exploits and said it was emotional the way his team won the game. \"During school, I have been required to bowl the last over quite a few times. But it can't bigger than this stage.\nYou are bowling to one (Dhoni) of the best in the world and I have seen finish games even when I was as kid. So it was crucial to keep a clear mind. I was lucky to get the advice of AB and other players.\"\nSenior batsman Hashim Amla too was all praise for Rabada.\n\"Thankfully over the the last couple of years we have had many memorable wins. This was definitely one of them. If someone was watching TV in the 40th over of the chase, they would have their money on India winning. But Imran Tahir s over was a big game changer and KG s (Rabada) last over was brilliant.\n\"We had planned it (how to bowl the final over). It seems like a pretty tough length to hit. But KG bowled exceptionally well. I think it shows he can hold his composure in a situation like that. It is a testimony to his maturity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:59:21.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
