By Dennis Knight\nThe level of play for high school volleyball in the Coastal Empire is on the rise, and the Georgia High School Association is taking notice.\nOn Wednesday night, a GHSA seeding committee awarded byes to the Class A semifinals next Wednesday for top-seeded Calvary Day and No. 2 seed Savannah Christian in what was somewhat of a surprise to the coaches at both schools.\nIn Class AA, St. Vincent’s earned a No. 4 seed. The Saints will host Pace Academy in a quarterfinal at 11 a.m. Saturday.\nSavannah Christian was ranked No. 1 among Class A teams by Score Atlanta nearly all season, but Calvary came back from a two-set deficit to beat the Raiders to win the Area 1-A title.\nCalvary (31-9) swept visiting Brookstone and Paideia in the first two playoff rounds. Savannah Christian swept First Presbyterian in the first round and won at Mount Paran Christian in the second round. Calvary is led by setter Hannah Carver and outside hitter Claudia Chisolm.\n“I was completely shocked when I heard we had the bye,” Calvary coach Hannah Hunter said. “I was hoping to get a three or four seed and host. But I think the committee looked at strength of schedule. We played in some tournaments in Atlanta to try to get some exposure, and then beating Savannah Christian to win the Area must have helped.”\nLast year, Savannah Christian wasn’t awarded a bye. The Raiders went on the road and beat Eagle’s Landing Christian to advance to the state final, where they lost to Hebron Christian. The Raiders are led by Landon Jones and Lainey Aenchbacher.\n“I can’t believe we finally got the bye, not only us but Calvary, too,” said SCPS coach Julie Jones. “It would be pretty cool if we could meet for the state championship. But it’s also nice that we’ll both be hosting in the semis. It shows the GHSA is finally recognizing we have some talented teams in Savannah.”\nIf CDS and SCPS advance to the finals, the GHSA has it scheduled for Oct. 31 at Holy Innocents’ in Atlanta.\nThis is the farthest Calvary has advanced in the playoffs. CDS will host the winner of Athens Academy/Fellowship Christian. Hunter said both teams are smaller, and run smart, aggressive offenses.\n“I think we should match up well,” Hunter said. “We both will have scrappy teams and we’ll need to keep the ball in play and minimize our errors.”\nJones said she expects to face Landmark Christian in the semis. The War Eagles feature last year’s Class A player of the year Cameron Dobbs, who leads the team with 457 kills.\n“They are a lot bigger than us, but we’re used to that,” Jones said. “We’ll have to keep our offense fast, stop Dobbs and try to keep them out of their system.”\nSt. Vincent’s will host Pace Academy in a rematch of last year’s thrilling quarterfinal won by SVA 25-10, 33-31, 17-25, 22-25, 15-9.\nThe Saints have one of the top hitters in the area in Sarah Stewart and a quality setter in Sydney Sanders.\n“I don’t know as much as I would like to know about Pace Academy yet,” SVA coach Lindsey McIntyre said. “But they look a lot like us based on their roster. They have two returning seniors and a team full of juniors; we have three seniors and five juniors. We’re really excited to be hosting and we’re expecting another exciting showdown.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14830565.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14830565.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:12:40.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
