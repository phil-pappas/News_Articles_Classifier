A bevy of teams had byes last weekend because the season has reached its halfway point. \nThere might not be many changes after this weekend, either. \nNinth-ranked Ansonia is involved in the biggest game of Week 7 as it travels to play fellow unbeaten Torrington in what could be the biggest Naugatuck Valley League game of the season. \nAnsonia (5-0) has ruled the NVL almost every season, including being the league’s top team seven of the last 13 years. The Red Raiders (6-0) returned the league’s most experienced team and one of its most talented. They gave Wolcott its first loss last Friday (37-27). \nThe Chargers have won 25 straight games against Torrington. The Red Raiders haven’t beaten Ansonia since 1986 (19-12). \nOther games that could affect the poll — No. 1 Southington (5-0) at Conard (4-1), Fairfield Prep (3-2) at No. 6 North Haven (5-0), Notre Dame-West Haven (3-2) at Hand (5-0), Capital Prep/Achievement First (4-0) at Abbott Tech/Immaculate (4-1), and Ellington (5-0) at Granby (5-0). \nNone of the 13 coaches voted an Eastern Connecticut Conference team for the second straight week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:38:55.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
