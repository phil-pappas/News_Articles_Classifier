Love it,” he said.\nThe NFL has been coming to London every year since 2007, when the Giants faced the Dolphins here, but fans still are getting a feel for the sport. The NFL expects a sellout crowd of around 84,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, which is similar to the numbers it has done in the 11 previous games here. The Jets-Dolphins game is the first of three NFL games here this year.\nThe crowds tell you there is a fanbase here for the sport, but there is very little buzz around town about the game. The NFL is competing with a huge sports weekend here. Arsenal will play Manchester United on Sunday afternoon, a huge game in the Premier League. That game should start during the second half of the Jets-Dolphins game. England also meets Australia in the Rugby World Cup on Saturday. Those events are getting most of the focus.\nParvinder Singh, who takes bets at Ladbroke’s on Edgware Road, said he only takes two-to-three bets on NFL games in a year.\n“It’s just awareness,” Singh said. “American football is popular with the tourists. We hardly attract any tourists at this location. It’s normal European football, including UK [that sees more action].”\nSingh said he is aware of the game being played Sunday because it’s part of his job, but people in his circle have no idea. He did point out the Edgware Road area, where the shop is located, is heavily Middle Eastern, and the NFL is more popular in other areas of London.\nAmelia Taylor said she had no idea a game was being played. While taking a smoking break outside the drug store at which she works, Taylor said she had not heard anything about it.\nIn many ways, it feels similar to a big European soccer game coming to MetLife Stadium. The place fills up and there is an audience of interested fans, but it does not really capture the imagination of all New York fans.\nStill, the NFL has data that keeps it coming back here and thinking of placing a team here permanently. According to the league, the sport is the fastest growing major professional sport in the United Kingdom, with more than 13 million fans. The NFL is the sixth-most watched sport in the UK during the season, based on Sky Sports viewership. That is up from 18th prior to the league playing games here.\nThe next step is clearly moving a team here, which could be a dicey proposition with many obstacles to clear.\n“I think it’s going to happen,” Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick said. “I don’t think it’ll happen in the next few years, obviously. But I think it’s something that will eventually happen because of how successful these games have been over here and the interest level and all that. And so there’s a lot of hurdles that they’re going to have to overcome, but I think eventually there will be a franchise here.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under miami dolphins ,  new york jets ,  nfl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:06:44.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
