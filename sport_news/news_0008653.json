And you can count on the memories flooding back from the time they enter the building Monday morning to the second their blades make contact with the ice surface. \n“Definitely,” Duclair said Sunday night. “I’m going to take time to look up in the stands, up to the rafters and remember. \n“It’s going to be a special moment for both of us. In Max’s case, with him being a Toronto kid and all the time his dad spent with the Leafs, well, he’s had this game circled on the calendar for a long time. \n“I wouldn’t be surprised if Max has the best game of his life Monday night.” \nThat’s good news for the Arizona Coyotes, bad news for Mike Babcock’s Maple Leafs. \n* * * * * \nIt’s been almost 10 months since Max Domi and Anthony Duclair had gold medals draped around their necks. Given what has transpired with their careers, it must seem like a lifetime ago. \nFor Domi, the 13th overall pick in the 2013 NHL draft, his goal of following up world-junior glory with a Memorial Cup title fell short when his London Knights were eliminated in the second round of the OHL playoffs by the Erie Otters. The Otters were led by some kid named Connor McDavid. No shame in losing to him. \nDuring the off-season, his No. 1 goal was to earn a spot on the Coyotes’ opening night roster. He did that with flying colours. \nThere, he joined his buddy Duclair, who now also calls the Valley of the Sun his hockey home. \nAt the time of the world juniors, Duclair, a speedy winger with huge upside, was a member of the New York Rangers organization. But that would change within two months. \nOn March 1, 2015, while playing for the Quebec Remparts of the QMJHL, Duclair was traded to the Arizona Coyotes along with John Moore and two draft picks in exchange for Keith Yandle and Chris Summers. The Rangers were willing to give up Duclair, arguably their top prospect, to add pieces which they thought might bring them a Stanley Cup in 2015. \nIt didn’t. \nMeanwhile, there already are signs that the Coyotes won the trade thanks to the addition of Duclair. \nIn eight games, Duclair has seven points. Three of those came thanks to his first NHL hat-trick on Oct. 15 against Anaheim. \n“I’m obviously surprised at how things have gone,” Duclair said. “I didn’t expect that. \n“We play with us-against-the-world mentality. So far, things have gone well.” \nFor the Coyotes. For Duclair. And, yes, for Domi, who has accrued three goals and six assists in his first eight NHL games, thanks in part to some significant power playing time with his world-junior linemate Duclair. \n“When we were put together at world-junior training camp, we just clicked,” Duclair said. “We just seemed to know where each other was on the ice. We had instant chemistry on the ice and we still do. \n”I think it helps that we’re such good friends off the ice too.” \nThe accolades have come fast and furious for these two kids. \nThey were interviewed together on Hockey Night in Canada by George Stroumboulopoulos. Don Cherry already is calling Domi the frontrunner for the Calder Trophy as the league’s top rookie, the same predication made by Teemu Selanne, his dad Tie’s former teammate in Winnipeg. Jaromir Jagr told TSN that Max is “(bleeping) unbelievable.” \nFor Max Domi, who grew up surrounded by the likes of Mats Sundin, Curtis Joseph and other NHLers because of his dad’s career, he’s clearly not nervous like other rookies who make it to the bigs. This is what he always wanted. This is what he always expected. \n“Probably the biggest thing growing up was seeing how hard they work and how amazing they were off the ice and in the community,” Max Domi told NHL.com the other day. “With hockey players, it’s tough to find a bad guy. That was definitely the thing that stood out to me the most. I learned a lot from that.” \nCoach Dave Tippett, who says Max is not awed “by anything,” has done everything in his power to make his golden kids feel comfortable, putting them together both on the road and on the power play. \n“It’s been great,” Duclair said. “We’re roommates on the road and almost neighbours in Phoenix. It’s pretty cool. \n“We talked all summer about playing on the same team and being together for a long time. Hopefully it happens.” \nIf it does, that will be a bonus for restaurant owners in the Phoenix area for years to come. \n“Yeah, we eat out a lot,” Duclair admitted. “We don’t cook much.” \nShould they keep up their recent play, there might be a few free meals in their future. \n* * * * * \nWhen the Leafs face off against the Coyotes Monday, they won’t be caught off guard by Domi and Duclair — nicknamed The Killer D’s. \nBecause of their own stints with the OHL’s Knights, Toronto defenceman Scott Harrington and centre Nazem Kadri are particularly familiar with Domi from his time in London. \n“I know Max pretty well,” Harrington said after the Leafs wrapped up practice Sunday at the Mastercard Centre. “He lived a couple of streets over from us in London, I drove him to the rink every day, so I got to know him. \n“I’m sure he’s pumped up for this game. It’s going to fun to face him.” \nFun? We’ll wait and see how that works out, especially if Domi hits the scoresheet numerous times. \nHarrington and Domi were teammates with the Knights two seasons ago. As for Kadri, while he didn’t play junior with Domi, he said the two have mutual friends \n“I see him lots in the summer,” Kadri said. “Some of his buddies in London are some of my buddies too.” \nWhile Duclair planned to spend a quiet Sunday evening in Toronto preparing for the game, a Coyotes official said Max had joined his father Tie for dinner at an aunt’s house. \nOn Monday, Team Canada’s golden boys will return to the ACC, this time as NHLers. And you can bet their number one goal will be to enjoy the same type of result they did the previous time they played there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:29:19.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
