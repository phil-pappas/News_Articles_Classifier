This wasn't the way he expected to start the season, but it's a reality with which he has become all too familiar.\nShumpert's wrist will remain in the cast for another week before he can begin another rehab, this time for a tear in his wrist. That will follow rehab stints from a ligament tear in his knee, a dislocated shoulder and a litany of other smaller injuries, such as shoulder and groin problems that limited his effectiveness in June's NBA Finals.\n\"Mentally I think it was just the timing,\" Shumpert said Tuesday. \"If I would've gotten a couple of games in and then it happened in a game, it'd be easier to deal with. But when you go through your whole summer ... I could've got hurt in June or July when I first started working out and been back already.\"\nShumpert wrote a piece for Bleacher Report explaining the process behind the injury. He hurt the wrist on a dunk during workouts at Georgia Tech, where he played collegiately. He said Tuesday when he went for the MRI, he was expecting to hear he might be shut down for a week or two. He never expected the three-month prognosis he was handed prior to the surgery.\n\"I didn't want to come back in the middle of guys already having a groove with each other. I know we added a lot of new pieces. I didn't want to come back and mess up the chemistry,\" he said. \"But so be it.\"\nThe Cavs won't have a full roster now before December at the earliest. Coach David Blatt confirmed Tuesday the plan is for Kevin Love to be ready for the Oct. 27 opener (he has recently been cleared for three-on-three games with the hope of progressing to full practices by the weekend), while Kyrie Irving isn't expected to be ready for the opener.\nNo firm timeline has been established for Irving, but with Shumpert not expected back until December anyway, it's going to be awhile yet before the Cavs look like the team they hope to be in June.\n\"We've got to get healthy, that's our main thing,\" LeBron James. \"It seems it's been so long since we had a full group. I would love to see us just get full at some point, hopefully it's not February, March. Hopefully it's more late December, January, to see what type of team we can become. We won't reach our full potential until March and that's OK. That's when you should start peaking. But you'd like to see what you're capable of doing earlier than that.\"\nShumpert wrote in the Bleacher Report piece that, \"playing through the shoulder injury in the playoffs was a hell I don't wish on anyone,\" but he remains hesitant to divulge how much it affected his game.\n\"It wasn't my shooting hand, but it hurt,\" he said Tuesday. \"It was hard to go left, hard to finish. Hard to lift it up, but I played. No excuse. If I get out there, I expect people to set screens on it and test it out to see if I should be out there or not. I think the Warriors did a great job testing it. It is what it is.\"\nShumpert enjoys writing and said he does it often. He also writes his own lyrics and penned the Fox Sports Ohio open for last season's playoff run. Bleacher Report approached him to write a first-person essay on the injury, but he isn't expecting it to be a consistently recurring role -- at least not once he's healthy during the season.\n\"I think it was great for the fans to see that,\" he said. \"I know I'm not going to be capable of doing that all the time. Time won't allow it when I'm focused on the season, but here and there when I can, if they want me to do a piece I wouldn't turn it down.\"\n(c)2015 Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio)\nVisit the Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio) at www.ohio.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1733642", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1733642&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1733642&h=Cavaliers+guard+Shumpert+handling+frustration+of+another+long+rehab"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:18:17.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
