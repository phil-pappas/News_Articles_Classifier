(Dale Zanine/USA Today Sports) \nThe Redskins hope to have two contributors who are dealing with back injuries on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Bucs. \nRunning back Chris Thompson did not participate in Wednesday’s practice, while defensive end Stephen Paea was limited. Thompson, who suffered the back injury in Sunday’s 34-20 loss to the New York Jets, said he was still sore but felt improvement. He remained in the game despite dealing with back spasms after diving for a pass attempt from quarterback Kirk Cousins.

(Gary Hershorn/Associated Press) \nThompson said he couldn’t sit down throughout the game, battling through the pain with the Redskins already playing without rookie Matt Jones. Thompson said the swelling has improved over the past two days but not as quickly as he hoped, which forced him to miss practice. Instead, he was working on the side with a trainer. \nAfter breaking his back at Florida State in 2011, Thompson knew the injury wasn’t as severe once he walked back to the sideline without assistance. \n“It happened so fast that initially it kind of felt like my back went numb, and I thought I had broke it again,” Thompson said. “But as I was laying there, as the seconds went by I kept feeling better and better. I started kind of moving around a little bit on my own. I was like ‘All right, I’m fine.’ ” \n[ TE Reed puts his chance of playing at 100 percent ] \nPaea was active but didn’t play against New York. He entered the game as questionable with the back issue, but the Redskins used Chris Baker and Frank Kearse at the position. Paea said he feels well enough to play against Tampa Bay after taking a cautious approach last week. \n“I didn’t want to stay out,” Paea said. “It’s one of those things where if I play in that game, it probably would’ve made it worse, miss this game or something like that. I just listened to the trainers and did whatever they told me to do and trying to get better.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:29:23.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
