Noel Spartans Stadium witnessed a notable performance by Moberly against Class 4 9th-ranked Mexico that has dominated most teams on its 2015 schedule. The Bulldogs entered the contest averaging more than 400 yards of total offense, including 364 yds. rushing, a plus-9 in the turnover department, and Mexico was outscoring its opponents by an average 38-11 margin. However, with this being Senior Night, the Spartans rose to the occasion. Moberly’s defense kept Mexico about 90 yards shy of its average offensive production, forced a Bulldog turnover that led to a Moberly touchdown, and the Spartans stayed within eight points of their North Central Missouri Conference rival for much of this battle, putting themselves into position for an upset. But Mexico (9-1, 5-1 NCMC) produced two long rushing touchdowns in the fourth quarter and held on to defeat Moberly 34-27. With the Spartans (3-6, 2-4 NCMC) being the underdog and having its fair share of struggles stopping the run or visiting the end zone more frequently, the kind of effort and play Moberly has exerted in these past two weeks certainly would give a program momentum and a confidence boost going into first round of district play that starts next Friday. While Moberly first year head coach Cody McDowell noted the effort against Mexico should provide a momentum boost and incentive for his players to work a little harder in practice this week, he did not feel the outcome was a moral victory by any means. “I’m not a big moral victory type of guy. This is one of those deals in which a loss is a loss. You play the game to win,” said McDowell. “It came down to us making too many mistakes in the first half and a couple in the fourth quarter. We ended up having too many drops offensively, a couple of missed assignments defensively and I think those kind of mistakes is what really hurt us.” “But those are things we can fix in practice, and we have a week ahead of us to do it before we play Mexico again,” he added. “I think our kids are confident enough thinking they can come out and beat anybody. You can see that when we do things right against anybody we play. We just need to get our stuff ready and take care of us.” NOTE: To read the rest of the story pick up a copy of the Monday, Oct. 19 issue of the Monitor-Index.
