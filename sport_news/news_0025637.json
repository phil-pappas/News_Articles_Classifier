Participating in the T-44 category at the October 2-11 tournament, para athlete Anandan won a gold medal in the 200m race with a record Asian timing of 24.04 seconds. He followed that up with a silver in the 100m event.\nThe 200m result ensured that Anandan qualified for the 2016 Paralympics to be held at Rio de Janeiro.\nReturning to Bengaluru on Monday morning, Anandan - who became the first Indian para athlete in T-44 category to bag medal for the Army in the World Para Military Games and to break the Asian record - was received by the commandant at MEG & Centre and given a rousing reception by sportsmen and jawans.\nEnrolled into the MEG in 2005, Anandan completed his training and was posted to 10 Engineer Regiment. He suffered serious injuries to his left knee in a landmine blast in June 2008. He underwent surgery in Pune but doctors were forced to amputate his leg below the knee.\nUndeterred by his ill fortune, Anandan soldiered on and focused on his sporting abilities. An artificial leg was specially designed for him during his rehabilitation. He won a 200m gold in the 2014 IPC Athletics Grand Prix in Tunisia and also participated in 17th Asian Para Games at Incheon.\nSeen as a medal prospect in the Para World Championship and World Military Games, Anandan - also backed by the Paralympic Committee of India - was sent to Colombo last month where he excelled in the Sri Lanka Army Para Games by lowering his 100m personal best to 12.29s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:40:36.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
