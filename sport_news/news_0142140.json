Show Caption Previous Next \nIMMOKALEE — A new champion was crowned. Florian Kohler of France knocked off Gabi Visoiu of Romania in the final round of the 2015 Trick Shot Magic Championship at the Seminole Casino Hotel Immokalee on Thursday. \nThe score was 8-6, with three shots left. Kohler was up first, and if he hit his shot and Visoiu missed, Kohler would win. So, he used an original shot called the double masse. \nThe shot was timed. In under four seconds, he had to sink two balls into the corner pocket, then put a back spin on the cue ball, so it would come back down the rail and sink a ball in the far corner. Kohler made the shot and it stumped Visoiu. \n\"Every year you've got to come with new shots if you want a chance to win,\" Kohler said. \"With the new shot, the idea is to actually have an edge somehow, so you got to make them learn a special way or something.\" \nVisoiu is the 2015 overall world artistic pool champion and ranked No. 4 in the world according to artisticpoolplayers.com. He defeated No. 2 ranked Nick Nikolaidis of Canada to advance to the championship round, but he couldn't keep up with the hot shot, Kohler. \n\"Florian, he's the new guy,\" Visoiu said. \"He's the sensation. And, he can make a shot.\" \nThe Trick Shot Magic Championship was filmed by ESPN and will be aired in December. ESPN Billiards filmed events at the Seminole Casino Hotel Immokalee Tuesday through Thursday and the events are scheduled to air on Dec. 13, 20 and 27 on ESPN or ESPN2. The dates are subject to change. \nBefore Kohler, who's ranked No. 7, met Visoiu, he had to take down the reigning Trick Shot Magic champion of four years, No. 1 ranked Andy Segal of the United States. During a match, each competitor attempted up to six shots, which his opponent had to match. Kohler's and Segal's match came down to the last shot. \nWith the score tied 5-5, Kohler presented the shot. Using three cue sticks at once, he hit six balls. The balls were in two rows of three, and the rows were next to each other. Cue sticks were used as guides toward the pockets, giving a little room for error. With one shot, he used the three sticks to split the balls — three going in one pocket and three going to the opposite pocket. After Kohler sunk the shot, Segal failed and was eliminated. \nThe closest match of the day was between Visoiu and Nikolaidis. The score was tied after each player presented their six shots, so it came down to sudden death. An official placed a $100 bill on the table and each competitor had to shoot the cue ball as close to the bill as they could. The trick? The cue ball had to ricochet off the rail eight times. Visoiu advanced by landing the ball closer. It came within inches of the bill. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
