A Division Bench of the High Court also made it clear that the educational qualification fixed by experts could not be the subject matter of judicial review. The assertions came as the Bench dismissed a bunch of petitions filed by Sunil Sharma and other aspirants for postgraduate teachers in computer sciences. The petitioners, with degrees in MSc Computer Science or Master in Computer Applications from distance education mode, had challenged essential qualifications prescribed for postgraduate teachers in computer science. They said the Haryana Staff Selection Commission issued advertisement on July 15 inviting applications for 446 posts. The appointment was governed by the Haryana State Education School Cadre (Group-B) Service Rules, 2012, which prescribed “only those candidates were eligible to apply for the posts who obtained degrees as regular students”. The petitioner argued that a degree obtained from distance education mode was on a par with the degree obtained through regular mode of attending classes and could not be differentiated only on the basis of medium of instructions. The duration of the course, mode of examination and syllabus for obtaining a degree in the MSc Computer Science or the MCA was same, they contended. Therefore, the distinction between regular course and distance education mode was arbitrary and unreasonable. After hearing the arguments, the Bench of Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice Raj Rahul Garg held: “Once the state government has framed statutory rules in exercise of the powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution, such rules being legislative cannot be challenged except on account of violation of any other statute or the Constitution. The prescribing of the qualifications required for a post is a matter of experts to decide. Once the experts have fixed a particular qualification, the same cannot be made subject matter of judicial review”. Dismissing the petitions, the Bench ruled: “Prescribing a postgraduate degree in the MCA or MSc in computer science after undergoing a regular course cannot be said to be illegal or arbitrary which may warrant interference in the writ jurisdiction of this court”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:09:24.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
