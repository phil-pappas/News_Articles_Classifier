It is on this day that we hear comments from Calipari that will be repeated and referenced all season long. (Often from his detractors if anything he says can be mocked on down the road.) \nI will soon be sitting in a packed Wildcat Den in the Joe Craft Center, rubbing elbows with the biggest names in online and print media, and flicking boogers at Pat Forde, probably. It is one of the rare days in this profession that requires me to wear more than my underwear and join other people in the real world before the sun goes down. And I plan to carpe this diem. \nHere’s what you can expect… \n\nWe will live blog John Calipari’s comments at 11 am. \nCoach Cal is set to hold his news conference at 11 am and we will be seated front and center to live blog his comments for those who care to follow his comments via our live blog. \nWe will also have a live video stream to go along with his comments, so buckle up for a one-two punch of coverage here on KentuckySportsRadio.com. \nA complete rundown will follow once I get around to it. Lunch will be served after Calipari and that will probably take priority. \nFollow me on SnapChat and Periscope for a behind-the-scenes look at Media Day. \nOnce the players are released to the masses for interviews, I will be Periscoping and SnapChatting the entire scene from behind the hardworking reporters. Follow me at drew_franklin on either social media app for the closest thing to being there yourself. \nThe player interviews can be a little repetitive, especially after that October 1 release of basketball content, so I will focus on more important things. You’ll have to tune in to see what I find. \nMrs. Tyler will share her first Media Day experience at 8 pm. \nI don’t know how she managed to avoid it all these years, but today is Mrs. Tyler’s first trip to UK Basketball Media Day. Look for her recap of the entire day on the website at 8 pm tonight. \nNew KSR football podcast today! \nFreddie Maggard, Jared Lorenzen, Nick Roush and Casanova Subpackage recorded another KSR football podcast yesterday and it’s full of UK-Auburn knowledge and laughs. Freddie studied tomorrow night’s game harder than any game this season and he has plenty to say about the matchup. Things got goofy toward the end of the show, per usual, and I guarantee you’ll enjoy the silliness. It was yet another fun and informative show by the squad and I hope you’ll give it a listen when it’s released later today. We are shooting for a release some time around your lunch break. \nWe will also hear from Mark Stoops. \nJohn Calipari isn’t the only coach addressing the media today. Mark Stoops will answer questions one last time before his team kicks it off with Auburn tomorrow evening. He will be on the SEC coaches teleconference later this afternoon and we’ll pass along any newsworthy comments he makes. \nReally hoping to hear “C.J. Johnson is healthy and will play.” \nThere was Cat-on-Cat crime before last nights Kings-Lakers game. Instagram: @lakersscene \nDeMarcus Cousins playfully wrapped up Julius Randle during warmups before last night’s preseason game in Las Vegas. \nSpeaking of Cousins, his scavenger hunt around Lexington is tomorrow. Very cool of him to do that, not that anyone is surprised. \nKentucky Wildcats TV will release a new hype video today. \nGo ahead and apologize to your co-workers for whatever destruction you cause around the office after you see it. If it’s anything like what we’ve seen before every other football game this season, one unlucky wall is getting a new hole put in it. \nTubby Smith to receive the Legends of Coaching Award. \nKentucky’s former national championship coach will be honored with John Wooden’s Legends of Coaching Award in April. The annual award recognizes coaches who exemplify Wooden’s standards of coaching success and personal integrity. \nOther recipients include Dean Smith, Jim Boeheim, Roy Williams, Lute Olsen, Denny Crum, Bill Self, Pat Summit, Gene Keady, Billy Donovan, Tom Izzo and Mike Kryskekskeisksqiksiwi. \nGood for you, Orlando.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:11:33.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
