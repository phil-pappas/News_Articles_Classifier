But we have to worry about us and what we can control.\" \nCentral will have to control Kokomo's Jeron Gray, who gashed the Bearcats for 215 yards on the ground and six touchdowns. Kokomo scored nine touchdowns on the ground that evening. \nThe Yorktown football team will host Peru in the first week of Sectional 27. Yorktown is coming off a 42-28 loss to Pendleton Heights, while Peru sits at 7-1. \nYorktown coach Mike Wilhelm said playing against schools larger than his 3A Tigers helps prepare his squad for the postseason. Throughout the regular season, Yorktown plays three 5A squads and six 4A teams. \n\"Playing those teams makes us prepared and competitive,\" Wilhelm said. \"Peru is a solid football team, we know the coaching staff well and we're happy to have an opportunity to play this game at home.\" \nLast season, Yorktown advanced to the regional round before falling to Fort Wayne Bishop Luers, a team it could face again if the Tigers advance far enough. \nDelta has to take to the road to open the postseason, traveling to a 3-5 Greenfield-Central squad it just beat last Friday 33-14. \nThe Eagles look to win their first sectional since 2009. Last season, Delta fell in the sectional championship to rival Yorktown. \nJay County hosts Mount Vernon, while New Castle hosts Richmond to round out 4A. Jay County is coming off consecutive wins against South Adams and Indianapolis Marshall, outscoring them 96-8. \nWes-Del will face a tough assignment in the first week of sectional play, hosting 1A No. 7 Adams Central. The Flying Jets are 8-0 on the season with a dominating 47-3 win over Jay County earlier in the season. \nIn 2A, Winchester and Mr. Football candidate Kiante Enis travel to Eastern (Greentown), while Blackford faces Taylor. \nMonroe Central will be staying home for its first game of the postseason, hosting Anderson Prep. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1LpI4rl TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:31:08.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
