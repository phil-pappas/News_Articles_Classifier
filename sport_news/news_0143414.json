Forde has Northwestern as the No. 2 seed in the CFP.\nAccording to Forde, if the playoffs were to start this week, Northwestern would play Florida in the Orange Bowl for the right to move on to the national championship game.\nPat Forde :\nNorthwestern’s defense has been impenetrable, leading the nation in fewest points allowed per game at seven. Opponents have made 10 trips into the red zone against Northwestern and only scored one touchdown. Next up for Pat Fitzgerald’s team is a game that has rocketed up the Intrigue Scale: at Michigan on Saturday.\nForde puts a huge emphasis on Northwestern’s wins against Stanford and Duke, the lone loss on the year for both schools.\nJoining Northwestern and Florida, according to Forde, is fellow surprise team Utah at No. 1 and No. 4 Baylor.\nForde has the likes of TCU, Ohio State, Michigan State and Texas A&M among those considered for a playoff spot.\nNorthwestern jumped up in the AP and Coaches Poll rankings. They are now ranked No. 13 and No. 14 in each poll, respectively.", "external_links": ["https://it.sports.yahoo.com/notizie/forde-s-fab-four--where-merit-means-more-than-school-name-010524690-ncaaf.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:03:55.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
