He’s got to be able to handle it. I’m really proud of him.”\nJohnson’s migration from reserve cover corner to the eighth man in the box began with a disciplinary action. Johnson became the Eagles starting boundary corner when Bryce Jones was kicked off the squad on Sept 28, 2014, for violating team rules. He then suffered an arm injury against Clemson on Oct. 18 and missed the last five games of the regular season, returning for the Pinstripe Bowl on Dec. 27.\n“Last year was a real difficult loss when he went down against Clemson and missed those last few games,” said Brown. “When guys that are trained corners move to safety they have coverage skills and that makes you secondary better in the long run.”\nBC free safety Justin Simmons helped Johnson make the transition.\n“The safety and the corner work together a lot so just witnessing what he (cornerback) is doing and doing well, that makes doing my job at the same time much easier,” said Johnson. “That made it and easy transition but safety means being more of a tackler.”\nJohnson started five games and has 18 tackles with half sack, an interception and a forced fumble. The BC front seven has been so effective against the run that there are few leftovers for Johnson and Simmons to clean up.\nThe Eagles held Florida State preseason All-American Dalvin Cook, who was averaging 211 yards per game, to 54 yards on 15 carries.\n“I love working with that front seven because it’s the best in the country, I believe,” said Johnson. “Usually they do their job really well but if something leaks out it is our job to get the guy on the ground.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:10:39.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
