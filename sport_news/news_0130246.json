(Travis Bell/SIDELINE CAROLINA) × COLUMBIA — South Carolina has a full complement of quarterbacks in practice for the first time in a month, but Perry Orth will remain the starter for Saturday’s game against Vanderbilt — the first for the Gamecocks under interim head coach Shawn Elliott. Connor Mitch, a sophomore who started the first two games of the season but has been out four weeks with a separated throwing shoulder, returned to practice this week and will “be available,” against the Commodores, Elliott said Wednesday on the SEC coaches’ teleconference. True freshman Lorenzo Nunez, who started two games before going down Oct. 3 with a sprained shoulder, is back at practice but will probably be a game-time decision, Elliott added. Nunez did not play last weekend against LSU. Mitch is “still a little rusty in some things, but he’s just trying to get back into the flow of things,” said Elliott, named interim coach after Steve Spurrier’s resignation Tuesday. “The practice habits have got to come back. You don’t just sit out for a few weeks and come back and be as crisp and as sharp as you once were.” Michael Scarnecchia, a redshirt freshman who saw his first playing time last week at LSU, is also available. Orth, a junior, will be making his third career start. “I think we’re in good shape,” Elliott said. “I think we’re in really good shape. Perry Orth has gotten this team to rally around him, so to speak.” Spurrier’s swan song In their chat prior to USC’s game last weekend against No. 6 LSU, Tigers coach Les Miles said Spurrier raved about receiver Pharoh Cooper, and looked like his usual self. The Gamecocks fell 45-24 in what turned out to be Spurrier’s final game at South Carolina, and as a college coach. “To me, he was tremendously competitive in his last game. You could tell he made some of those calls himself. He was awfully proud of (Cooper), a great player. I would not have been able to predict any of that,” Miles said, referring to what came next. “But I can tell you, he spent his time talking to me about his great player and the enjoyment (he got out of) his team. In the 60 minutes that ensued, they were tremendously competitive. I think he called that game as he had for years.” Fournette and flood relief The American Red Cross collected $40,000 in donations for South Carolina flood relief at last week’s game in Tiger Stadium, moved from USC due to the aftermath of flooding in Columbia. LSU tailback Leonard Fournette also offered to auction his game jersey for flood relief, a move the NCAA assented to but must still traverse some bureaucratic hoops. Miles said he isn’t sure of process the auction will take, because it has to go through LSU’s compliance department. But “I felt that was a very sincere and warm gesture from Leonard,” he said. “We all were immersed in what were our Katrina and Rita experiences, and we realized some of the unfortunate environments that South Carolina is going though. For him to recognize that ... I thought he did a great job.” Get more news delivered to your inbox:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:16:20.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
