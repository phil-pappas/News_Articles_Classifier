He is receiving the proper care,” the unidentified official told pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat in remarks published on Thursday.\nThe prison's doctor is visiting him daily, he said. “There is no need to transfer him to hospital.”\n“But the judiciary will not hesitate to approve any request made by the doctor” to take him to hospital, the official added.\nAl-Asir's mother said on Wednesday that his health was rapidly deteriorating in prison.\nShe urged the authorities to transfer him to Roumieh prison, saying al-Reyhanieh “is unsuitable for his health situation.”\nAl-Asir was arrested in August at Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport while trying to travel to Nigeria via Cairo with a fake Palestinian passport.\nAl-Asir, a firebrand anti-Hizbullah cleric, had been on the run since June 2013 after his armed supporters clashed with the Lebanese army in the southern port city of Sidon. The fighting killed 18 Lebanese soldiers.\nG.K.\nD.A.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:02:31.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
