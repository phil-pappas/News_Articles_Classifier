Kiara Boggs (Santa Margarita) and Rylie Edward (Santa Margarita) posted a 79 and 80, respectively, to round out the top five. \n“It feels pretty good being the leader, being a freshman, too. I didn’t think that I would be playing this well, but I am happy with my score,” Utu said.. \nIn other girls golf: \nDana Hills’ Joan Soewondo edged Tesoro’s Emma Kang by two strokes at Camp Pendleton Memorial Golf Course in San Diego to win the South Coast Legaue Finals. Soewondo finished with a 3-over 147. ... \nBeth Lillie and Felicia Chang gave Troy a 1-2 finish in the Freeway League Finals at La Mirada Golf Course. Lillie won the tournament by four strokes, carding a 1-under 125 while Chang took second with a 129 total. \nContact the writer: ddottore@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:39:38.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
