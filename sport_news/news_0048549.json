Edmonton secured a home playoff game with the victory although both teams were already assured playoff berths heading into the game. Calgary had already secured a home playoff matchup while both teams have three games to play in the regular season.\nThe Eskimos take the season series between the provincial rivals with a two and one record, which is the tiebreaker should both clubs have the same record at the regular season's conclusion.\nThe team that finishes first in the division hosts the division final and has a bye week before that game.\nThe Stampeders suffered their first loss in eight home games this season and their three-game winning streak came to an end. The Eskimos have won five in a row for the first time since 2011 when they opened 5-0.\nKenny Stafford had a touchdown catch for the Eskimos with Sean Whyte kicking two field goals, a convert and a pair of punt singles in the low-scoring affair.\nEric Rogers caught a touchdown pass for Calgary. Running back Jon Cornish added a two-point convert. Rob Maver booted three punt singles and had one negated because of a Stampeder penalty.\nEskimos quarterback Mike Reilly completed 29 of 40 passes for 264 yards and a touchdown. Stampeder starter Bo Levi Mitchell was 17-for-30 in passing for 230 yards and a touchdown throw.\nEdmonton improved to 9-1 when holding opponents to 19 points or less\nThe Stampeders marching into Edmonton territory late in the fourth quarter, Mitchell was intercepted by Cauchy Muamba on a throw intended for Marquay McDaniel with a minute and a half remaining in the game.\nMaver's 64-yard punt single was the lone point of the third quarter, but Whyte replied with one from 50 yards at 1:36 of the fourth to restore a four-point cushion for Edmonton.\nTrailing 14-1 with just 35 total yards on offence late in the second quarter, Calgary came to life with nine points in the last two minutes of the half.\nMitchell capped a five-play, 65-yard drive with a 30-yard touchdown throw to Rogers in the end zone. Cornish produced the two-point convert on a one-yard plunge at 13:32. Maver added a 78-yard punt single.\nOn the final play of the half, Reilly was intercepted by former Eskimo Brandon McDonald air-mailing to Derel Walker in the end zone.\nWhyte kicked a 43-yard field goal for Edmonton at 12:38 of the second quarter.\nDefensive back John Ogo picked off Mitchell for his fifth pick this season and gave the Esks the ball on Calgary's 42-yard line.\nThe visitors parlayed the turnover into a touchdown with Stafford fighting off Stampeder safety Jamar Wall in the end zone for a 33-yard catch at 6:42.\nAfter a 58-yard punt single from Maver early in the first quarter, Whyte put the visitors up 3-1 with a 30-yard field goal at 10:50. Whyte's 57-yard single at 4:32 of the second quarter made it 4-1 for the Esks.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:09:26.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
