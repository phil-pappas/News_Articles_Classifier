The Munnabhai series. Now the filmmaker is all set to create a film on the life of his best buddy Sanju Baba. Who's playing Sanjay in the film? Ranbir Kapoor. But here's what the film has been titled.\nRaju has two choices which he thinks suits the film. The two names that he has in mind are Baba and Dutt. The filmmaker is a little indecisive at the moment as to which title to use for the film. So he has decided to wait a little more till Sanjay is out of jail and he's asked Sanjay and wife Manyata Dutt to take the call.\nSo in all probabilities, the film will either be called 'Baba' or 'Dutt'. Why? Sanjay is lovingly called Baba by his close friends and Dutt being his surname suits the film as well.\nBaba or Dutt - Which one would you pick?", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-10-05T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:18:24.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
