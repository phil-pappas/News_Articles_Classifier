Lyle, a five-star recruit, committed to Louisville a few weeks after the trip, but ended up de-committing. Another former Louisville recruit, Antonio Blakeney of LSU, reportedly also has been interviewed by the NCAA.\nThe allegations were levied in the recently released book, “Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,” in which former self-described madam Katina Powell wrote that she provided four escorts to perform a “show” for Lyle, in a rendezvous arranged by former Louisville staff member Andre McGee, who is on leave from his job as an assistant at Missouri-Kansas City while the investigation continues.\n“Been a long time since we’ve been up to U of L to do a show,” Powell wrote. “McGee texted me like, what’s up? He wanted me to bring three girls up there for a new recruit named JaQuan Lyle, he and his friend. I took [escorts] Rod-Ni, TooTall, Jazmine and Shay, who calls herself Sammi. TooTall made $100, Shay made $100, and Jazzy made nothing because she did absolutely nothing.”\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports, Lyle’s eligibility for the upcoming season shouldn’t be in jeopardy.\n“It does not affect us or JaQuan at all,” Ohio State associate athletic director for communications, Dan Wallenberg, told Yahoo! Sports. “We’ve been told, and are pretty confident, this is not something we need to worry about.”\nLouisville coach Rick Pitino has denied any knowledge of the alleged prostitute procurement happening under his nose.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under louisville cardinals ,  ohio state buckeyes ,  rick pitino", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:29:53.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
