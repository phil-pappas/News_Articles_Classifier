Unfortunately, the Trojans have provided little evidence that they are capable of playing that way for four quarters.\nUSC has allowed 167.5 rushing yards per game – seventh in the Pac-12 and tied for 66th in the nation. The Trojans have surrendered 182 or more rushing yards in four of six games, including a season-high 214 against Notre Dame last week.\n“We’ve got to do a lot better job tackling and getting everybody running to the football,” senior linebacker Lamar Dawson said. “We’ve just got to gang-tackle him and make it a physical game.”\nIt’s going to take a group effort to keep Booker corralled. USC coaches raved about the 5-foot-11, 212-pound senior’s ability to break tackles and gain yards after contact.\n“The tailback is as good as anyone out there,” defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said. “He’s a very strong runner, got great balance. … The guy runs angry.”\nBooker ranks third in the Pac-12 and 10th in the nation in rushing, averaging 130.5 yards per game. The only team to bottle him up was Michigan in Week 1. The Wolverines have the second-best run defense in the nation, allowing 64.7 yards per game – more than 100 fewer than the Trojans.\n“Booker’s probably the best back that we’ve faced so far,” freshman linebacker Cameron Smith said. “They’re going to try to run it every single quarter. They’re not going to go away from it. We’ve just got to be physical and tackle well.”\nRECEPTIVE TO CHANGE \nSophomore Adoree’ Jackson again spent the majority of practice playing offense. It appears he’s going to have a sizable role on that side of the ball, and he’s embracing the opportunity.\n“It’s always exciting to be out there on offense,” Jackson said, “possibly getting the ball more, getting more touches, scoring some touchdowns hopefully.”\nWhether Jackson’s new role is a permanent or temporary change is unclear. Jackson, who has started at cornerback since the middle of last season, hinted that it’s a one-off – a byproduct of the matchup and USC’s injuries at receiver.\n“I think this game is just different from some,” Jackson said. “It’s just what we need right now as a team.”\nJackson, the 2014 Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year, is coming off his worst defensive game. Notre Dame’s Will Fuller beat him for a 75-yard touchdown and a 45-yard gain. He also drew a pass-interference penalty on Jackson.\nJackson said he lacked discipline on the touchdown play. He peaked into the backfield, allowing the speedy Fuller to get a step on him. Once that happened, it was impossible to recover.\n“There’s no way you could catch a guy like that,” Jackson said. “That’s rare to see a guy with speed like that. Hats off to him.”\nQUICK HITS \nReceivers Darreus Rogers (hamstring) and Steven Mitchell Jr. (ankle) remained out. Helton said they’re “50/50 at best” to play vs. Utah. … Zach Banner again got the majority of the reps at left tackle with Chad Wheeler out (concussion). Freshman Chuma Edoga again played right tackle. … Defensive linemen Delvon Simmons and Rasheem Green got dinged during practice. Helton said Simmons has a minor knee tweak. Green returned to the field after spending some time with trainers. … Tight end Taylor McNamara returned after missing Tuesday because of a stomach bug. Safety John Plattenburg and linebacker Michael Hutchings, also stricken by the bug, remained out. … Receiver Jalen Greene participated in team drills after being limited Tuesday because of a tight hamstring. … Scouts from the NFL’s Cardinals, Chargers and Jaguars attended part of practice.\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:13:01.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
