Senior quarterback Sean Chambers (14 touchdowns) has paced the passing attack, while Justin Taormina (613 rushing yards, 10 total TDs) has been a huge contributor in both the run and pass game. East will have its hands full trying to slow down the balanced attack that continues to improve week to week. \nBut speaking of consistent improvement, the Saints' triple-option offense continues to get better. East rushed for a season-high 376 yards last week and junior quarterback Zach Mitchell, who coach Bryce Farquhar expects to play after suffering an injury last week, threw a touchdown as well. \n\"We just try to keep progressing every week and we feel like we've done that,\" Farquhar said. \"Our three losses are all to very quality opponents, and as a team we feel good about where we are going.\" \nVikings coach Rob Wicinski will hope that his team stays level-headed and keeps each game in perspective as games with Glenbard East and Batavia are on the horizon in the next two weeks. \nExtra point: Geneva has beaten St. Charles East in five of the past six meetings. \nSt. Charles North (3-2, 0-2 UEC River) at Larkin (0-5, 0-2 UEC River), 7:30 p.m. today \nLast week's results: St. Charles North lost to Batavia, 48-28; Larkin lost to South Elgin, 56-13. \nThe skinny: Look out, Larkin, because North has some anger to take out this week. The North Stars have lost back-to-back games [to Geneva and Batavia] and want to get back to their winning ways. \"Very few teams go through a two-game stretch like we did these last two games,\" coach Rob Pomazak said. \"We feel like we got better and if these losses needed to happen for future successes, then they are good things. It's an understatement to say we're excited to get back out there.\" \nAlthough Larkin has yet to tally a win in 2015, Pomazak did say the Royals present some athleticism and have big-play potential that his team will need to limit. North quarterback Zach Mettetal has thrown for 1,125 yards and 14 touchdowns, with his three interceptions coming in the last two weeks. \nExtra point: Eric Lins set a school-record with his 80-yard touchdown run in Week 4 against Geneva. Lins has nine touchdowns on the ground. \nSycamore (2-3, 0-1 Northern Illinois Big 12 Conference East Division) at Kaneland (3-2, 1-1 NI Big 12 East), 7:15 p.m. today \nLast week's results: Sycamore shut out Ottawa, 35-0. Kaneland lost to DeKalb, 45-28. \nThe skinny: Just when it looked like the Knights were rolling and getting back to playing Kaneland football, last week happened. A tough loss to rival DeKalb puts Kaneland at 3-2 and in need of a response this week. \nAlthough Sycamore is coming off a shutout win, Knights coach Tom Fedderly will head into this contest with confidence that his team will pick up a victory. Since day one, Kaneland's goal has been to return to the postseason after missing the playoffs in 2014. \nExtra point: Sycamore has been a thorn in Kaneland's side the past couple seasons, winning the last two meetings. Those wins include a 2013 win that was the only regular season defeat Kaneland suffered that year. \nMarmion (2-3, 0-1 Chicago Catholic League Green) at Fenwick (2-3, 0-1 CCL Green), 1 p.m. Saturday \nLast week's results: Marmion won by forfeit; Fenwick beat DePaul College Prep, 38-19. \nThe skinny: The Cadets will be well-rested, but that doesn't mean it was enough time to get fully healthy. Junior quarterback Collin Gibson will get his second varsity start in place of Johnny Tate [anke], but with a forfeit this past week, Gibson had two weeks of getting all first-team reps. \nThe Cadets will look to rebound from a loss to Providence in Week 4 and pick up their first CCL Green win of the season. \nExtra point: Marmion has scored single digits in each of its three losses, with a 24-point showing in a season-opening win against Plainfield Central. \nSt. Laurence (3-2) at St. Francis (4-1), 7:30 p.m. today \nLast week's results: St. Laurence lost to Brother Rice, 52-35; St. Francis beat Chicago Catalyst/Maria, 58-8. \nThe skinny: St. Francis got back to its dominant winning ways last week, but a tougher opponent awaits in CCL crossover foe St. Laurence. Spartans coach Mike Fitzgerald got to see his team respond after the first defeat of the season in Week 4. \nSpartans quarterback Peter Fassnacht essentially got the night off last week, and fans should expect to see a full-force passing attack as St. Francis looks to become playoff eligible with a win. \nExtra point: Fassnacht has thrown 10 touchdown passes this season. \nMarengo (5-0, 3-0 Big Northern Conference East) at Burlington Central (0-5, 0-3 BNC East), 7 p.m. today \nLast week's results: Marengo beat Harvard, 42-19; Burlington Central lost to Genoa-Kingston, 42-14. \nThe skinny: Tonight begins a rough stretch for winless Burlington Central. The Rockets will host BNC East-leading Marengo in a game of teams headed in opposite directions. Marengo has scored at least 33 points in each of its first five games, while BC has not exceeded 14 points. \nExtra point: The Rockets will get their sixth attempt at picking up first-year head coach Jason Newburger's first win. \n– CHRIS CASEY – ccasey@shawmedia.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:12:13.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
