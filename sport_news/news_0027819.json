Wallabies veteran Adam Ashley-Cooper saw the entire game from the bench - and said it was just as hard watching. \nFinal score in that 2012 test in Newcastle, north of Sydney: Scotland 9, Australia 6. \nDavid Pocock was Australia captain that night, when Scotland scrumhalf Greig Laidlaw clinched it with a stoppage-time penalty after an errant Australian scrum. Pocock won’t be playing against Scotland on Sunday after he and rampaging fullback Israel Folau were ruled out with injuries, replaced by Ben McCalman and Kurtley Beale. \nSo after dominating the toughest group in the tournament and grinding out back-to-back wins over England and Wales, the Wallabies could be slightly vulnerable against a Scotland team that was angered by the suspensions of veteran hooker Ross Ford and lock Jonny Gray, the pair cited by an Australian commissioner for a dangerous tackle in their last game against Samoa. \nCenter Matt Scott was ruled out Friday with an injured back, forcing another change for Scotland. \n“Do we need to come out fighting after losing the three guys? We’d need to come out fighting regardless,” Scotland skipper Laidlaw said. “We’re in the quarters on merit and deserve our place - we’re not just here to make up the numbers.” \nAustralia has won 19 of the 28 tests between the nations, including a 33-16 victory in 2003 quarterfinals -the only time the teams have met at the World Cup. \nFor a reminder of the threat Scotland can pose, the two-time champion Australians don’t have to go back far in time. \nScotland ended a 27-year drought against the Wallabies with a 9-8 victory in Edinburgh in 2009. The Scots won the next game, too, on that wild, wet and windy night in 2012, its first victory in three decades on Australian soil. \nHooker Moore wants to make amends. He and center Matt Giteau were selected to make their 100th test appearances for the Wallabies on Sunday, and Ashley-Cooper will move to No. 3 on Australia’s all-time list of test caps when he runs out for the 112th time. \nCheika said he didn’t look at his lineup in terms of test caps, but focused instead on character. He said he was content with the “the combination of characters” he’d selected. \nHe also rejected the idea that Australia could become complacent being an odds-on favorite against Scotland, which didn’t win a game in the Six Nations and struggled to hold off Tier Two Samoa 36-33 in its last match. \n“It’s pretty easy - we don’t think we are (complacent),” Cheika said, referencing the start of his Wallabies coaching tenure that included losses to France, Ireland and England last November, when the Wallabies were all but written off as World Cup contenders. “No one was saying that about us however many months ago. \n“We’re acutely aware of the fact this (quarterfinal) is really important in our own journey as a team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:34:04.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
