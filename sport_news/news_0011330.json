Each teams is without its starting shortstop. \nMets shortstop Ruben Tejada was of course lost for the postseason because of Chase Utley 's controversial takeout slide in the NLDS . On the Cubs' side of things, Addison Russell will miss the NLCS (but could perhaps be back if the Cubs advance to the World Series) after injuring his hamstring against the Cardinals. Fortunately for both sides, they have adequate back-up. For the Mets, Wilmer Flores is a defensive downgrade from Tejada, but he's a capable hitter by the standards of the position (93 OPS+ over the last two seasons). \nOn the Cubs' end, 22-year-old Javier Baez steps into the breach. He's not Russell's peer with the glove, but at the plate he does he a high ceiling, particularly in terms of power (power to all fields, it should be noted). Just ask John Lackey ... \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nIn the end, each team probably holds steady when it comes to expected production from the position but suffers a downgrade in terms of fielding. On that front, Cubs and Mets pitchers during the regular season ranked, respectively, sixth and seventh in the NL in groundball percentage. On the other side, Cubs and Mets hitters ranked, respectively, 14th and 15th in the NL in groundball percentage. \n2. The Cubs were 7-0 against the Mets in the regular season, but â€¦ \nAs has been bandied about quite often since this matchup was locked in, the Cubs took all seven regular-season encounters against the Mets, and along the way outscored them 27-11. However, these games all took place between May 11 and July 2, and the Mets' offense at that time doesn't bear a great deal of resemblance to the here-and-now version. Yes, on the Cubs' side Kyle Schwarber was in the minors for both series against the Mets, and Jorge Soler was injured for the second set. It was the Mets, though, who truly didn't resemble what they'll be in the NLCS. \n3. The current Mets offense is a strength. \nRegarding the points above, the Mets' offense right now is anything but a liability. During the regular season, the Mets' offense ranked seventh in the NL at 4.22 runs scored per game. However, here's how that breaks down based on a carefuly chosen end-point ... \nMets offense through July 23: 3.4 runs per gameMets offense after July 23: 5.4 runs per game \nThat's a massive 58.9 percent improvement. Scaled to a full season, the 3.4 figure would rank last int he NL, while the 5.4, post-July 23 figure would rank second in all of baseball, behind only the DH-league, Rogers Centre-dwelling Blue Jays. So why choose this dividing line? Consider the changes that occurred during the second span of time ... July 24: Michael Conforto called up. He'll bat .270/.335/.506 the rest of the way. July 26: Yoenis Cespedes acquired prior to the non-waiver trade deadline. He'll bat .287/.337/.604 as a Met. July 31: Catcher Travis d'Arnaud returns from his second DL stint of the season. Up to this point, he's played in just 19 of the Mets' 102 games. The rest of the way, d'Arnaud will play in 48 of 60 team games and bat .256/.340/.464. Aug. 24: Captain David Wright , after being since April 15 because of spinal stenosis, is finally activated. He'll bat .277/.381/.437 over the remainder of the regular season. Other things have happened, yes -- Lucas Duda was a house afire after the break, for instance. But over this span, you've seen, generally speaking, half the non-pitcher portion of the Mets' lineup turned over and substantially improved. Looking at the season-long numbers drastically undersells the New York attack as it stands heading into the NLCS. \n4. The Cubs have been better against right-handed starters. \nIf the series goes the full seven games (and New York starters remain healthy), then the Cubs will likely face right-handed starting pitchers in six of those seven games. The lone lefty figures to be Steven Matz , and it's not likely he'll make more than one start. As well, Bartolo Colon figures to be the first fallback option, and he is of course right-handed. While there's nothing enviable about facing the swing-and-miss likes of Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard , and Jacob deGrom six times in a span of seven games, the Cubs in 2015 have been better against right-handed starters than they have against lefties. \nSpecifically, this season Cubs hitters have batted .247/.323/.409 against righty starters but just .235/.315/.355 against lefty starters. As well, the Cubs this season have struck out 23.8 percent of the time against right-handed starters while drawing unintentional walks 8.4 percent of the time. Against left-handed starters those respective figures are 26.9 percent and 8.5 percent. The unintentional walk rate is roughly even, but the Cubs are better at making contact and driving the ball against right-handed starters. Of course, most right-handed starters don't rise to the level of the Mets' troika noted above. \n5. The Mets are not a good base-stealing team. \nJon Lester is a very good starting pitcher, but he famously has issues throwing to first base and, by extension, holding runners on. During the regular season, he allowed a whopping 44 stolen bases in 55 attempts. On that front, it's worth noting that the Mets, who will likely face Lester twice in the NLCS, aren't poised to take advantage of this weakness. In 2015, the Mets ranked 29th in baseball with just 51 stolen bases -- or, if you prefer, fewer than Dee Gordon (58) or Billy Hamilton (57). As well, the Mets' were successful in just 67 percent of their attempts, which ranks 18th in MLB and is below the league-average mark of 70 percent. \nOn an individual level, the Mets' leader in steals this season, Curtis Granderson with 11, hasn't swiped a bag since Aug. 23. Juan Lagares is second with seven steals, but he's not a regular in the lineup these days. Eric Campbell and Darrell Ceciliani are tied for third on the team in steals with five apiece, but neither is on the postseason roster. \n6. Jake Arrieta 's velocity and movement were just fine in his last start. \nAlthough the Cubs prevailed over the Cardinals in Game 3 of the NLDS, the dominant Jake Arrieta wasn't quite so dominant. His line from that contest ... \nGiven that Arrieta has, counting his two postseason starts, thrown 3,648 pitches in 2015 versus a previous career high of 2,416 in 2014, one might suspect that fatigue set in. Maybe it has, but when it comes to velocity and movement, Arrieta checked out just fine last time out. Here's how velocity has tracked since the start of his dominant second half (0.75 ERA in 15 regular season starts after the break) and including his playoff starts against the Pirates and Cardinals ... \n(Chart via Brooks Baseball ) \nAs you can see, nothing out of line when it comes to Arrieta's velocity on any of his offerings. As well, the horizontal and vertical movement on all his pitches was also in keeping with his recent standards. From this standpoint, it seems his struggles against the Cardinals in Game 3 were just one of those things. He was never likely to continue running a sub-1.00 ERA, but there's nothing in there to suggest that Arrieta has hit a wall. \n7. Wrigley Field plays very different from Citi Field. \nThe two NLCS ballparks are, as you would probably guess, pretty different in their tendencies. Per Baseball Prospectus data , Wrigley inflates home run rates for batters on both sides of the plate but is especially accommodating toward right-handed power hitters (a 26 percent boost). Citi, meantime, is actually a bit more friendly than Wrigley when it comes to lefty power hitters, but it cuts down on right-handed home runs by a hefty 11 percent. Really, the parks almost couldn't be more different when it comes to how they affect homers by right-handed hitters. Wrigley's the most homer-friendly park in baseball for right-handers, and Citi checks in at 24th on that same list. As well, those tendencies have been pretty consistent throughout recent history. Maybe Mr. Cespedes will find Wrigley Field, where he's never played before, much to his liking. \n8. The Cubs played a much tougher schedule than the Mets did. \nThe Cubs played an unbalanced schedule in the NL Central, which yielded three playoff teams and the top three records in all of baseball. The Mets played an unbalanced schedule in the NL East, which was a cumulative 62 games under .500 in 2015 and played to a cumulative run differential of -297. On that front, the NL Central was 44 games over .500 with a run differential of +108. \nTo put a finer point on it, the Cubs' opponents' winning percentage was .502, and the Mets' was .485 (the lowest such figure in all of baseball). In matters related, the Mets this season played 96 games against losing teams, while the Cubs played 86. \n9. Joe Maddon and Terry Collins go way back. \nMets manager Terry Collins skippered the Angels from 1997 through late in the 1999 season. On his coaching staff for part of that time was ... current Cubs manager Joe Maddon. In fact, after Collins resigned in Anaheim, Maddon was named interim and managed the Angels over the final 29 games of the season. That season, the Angels went 51-82 under Collins and 19-10 under Maddon. \nAnd the NLCS managers say: Let's do this.
