By Jesse Newell jesse.newell@cjonline.com \nLAWRENCE — Brandon Schneider isn’t going to predict a bunch of victories or make bold proclamations in his first season as Kansas women’s basketball coach. \nHe can promise, however, that his team will compete a certain way. \n“We’ll play really, really hard,” Schneider said during KU women’s media day Wednesday at Allen Fieldhouse. “I think we’ve always been a team that would rotate and take a charge, that would jump over the scorer’s table after a loose ball, would dive on the floor. \n“I want us, especially here early, for fans and media and parents and everybody, to evaluate us on how hard we play.” \nIt’s the first part of a mantra Schneider has already set for his program: “Tough and together.” The words appear on the front page of the media guide, Schneider believes those two qualities will help set the groundwork for future success with the program. \nThe former Emporia State coach already thinks he has a bit of a head start in this particular rebuild. \n“Culture-wise, a lot of times you go into a program and inherit a mess. That’s not the case at all here,” Schneider said. “We have terrific kids, and they work really hard, and they want to get better.” \nToughness was emphasized most in September, as the women’s team completed a three-week “training camp” — something that hadn’t been done in previous years. \nOn certain days, the team split up into four, three-team groups and met for a 6:30 a.m. running session at Memorial Stadium. Each player had to run up and down all the stairs — sometimes in a weighted vest — while doing so as part of a three-person relay. \nThe setup encouraged teammates to pull for each other while competing. \n“We all had to figure out how to be tough,” junior forward Jada Brown said, “not individually, but together.” \nSchneider also is working in drills to get his offensive system implemented. The coach favors a 4-out, 1-in style that emphasizes an up-tempo pace. \n“We’re going to try to play the way we would like to play in the future,” Schneider said. “I feel like we can get a leg up maybe on Year 2 and Year 3.” \nThere are plenty of unknowns still with a team that has no seniors. Schneider is expecting a lot of competition in the coming weeks for starting and reserve roles. \n“Right now, I have no idea who’s going to provide us the bulk of the scoring, whether it’s one player or three players,” Schneider said. “I think right now, we’re going to have to be very balanced.” \nSchneider also is harping on working at game speed in practices. The coach says conditioning will be even more vital this year with the women’s game going to four quarters with a reduction in the number of timeouts. \nSo far, he’s been happy with his players’ effort. \n“It’s not like we inherited a bunch of bad apples at all,” Schneider said. “That makes it a lot more fun to come to work every day.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:08:46.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
