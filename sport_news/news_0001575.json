Being a defensive coordinator in the Big 12 has to be a headache-inducing experience. The 10-team league is filled with spread formations and it has the three most productive offenses at any level in college football. Baylor averages 725 total yards per game, followed by Texas Tech (631.7 ypg) and TCU (615.5 ypg) — and they are the highest-scoring FBS teams, too. West Virginia, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State are also among the top 25 FBS teams for total offense. Games involving Big 12 teams this season have averaged 66.1 points and a whopping 906.2 combined total yards — easily the highest among power five conferences, according to STATS. Counting only the games matching Big 12 teams against each other, the numbers are even higher — 72.9 points and 936.1 yards per game. kA 4=2DDlQAbQm~7 4@FCD6[ E96 q:8 `a 2=D@ 92D 7@FC E62>D C2?<65 ?62C E96 3@EE@> :? uq$ H96? :E 4@>6D E@ E@E2= 5676?D6] (:?=6DD z2?D2D W2==@HD dde]e J2C5D A6C 82>6X 2?5 %6I2D %649 Wdee]fX 2C6 :?
