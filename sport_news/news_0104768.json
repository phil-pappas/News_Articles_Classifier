Lambo then hit his third field goal of the game. \nThe Browns (1-3) had tied it at 27 on Josh McCown's 1-yard pass to Gary Barnidge with 2:09 to play and a 2-point conversion pass to Taylor Gabriel. That score was set up when the Browns won a challenge of McCown's 19-yard pass to Barnidge that originally was ruled incomplete. \nPhilip Rivers was 23 of 38 for 358 yards and three touchdowns for San Diego (2-2). McCown was 32 of 41 for 356 yards and two scores. Â©2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
