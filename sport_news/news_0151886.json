But if they do, the video board at Northwestern's Welsh-Ryan Arena should just show the following clip every time he enters the court. \n\nThis year, the school is getting more publicity — but for one of its sideline personas. \n\"I'm there, not to be an expert in kicking, but to be another set of eyes and another support for the kickers in particular and for the team as a whole,\" Sister Mauer told local station WDIO in Minnesota. \nHere's span class='cbs-more'>View More: The Spark News | Sports News | Live News | More News Videos … Princess Elsa \nThe rookies were made to dress up in costumes for the Cubs' flight homes, outfits that included Elsa from Disney's \"Frozen,\" Belle from \"Beauty and the Beast,\" and Dorothy from \"The Wizard of Oz.\" \npic.twitter.com/0BQ9mcyb6w — Kyle Schwarber (@kschwarb12) October 1, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:42:27.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
