You may also discover a color-blocked Ovadia & Sons sweater or a checked Hugo Boss BOSS 2.01 % suit. In the past couple years, Mr. Cruz, 28, has immersed himself in the world of high fashion, attending runway shows, modeling in an ad campaign for French label Givenchy and designing a small collection with cult denim brand 3x1. He recently became spokesperson for Boss Bottled, the Hugo Boss fragrance line.\nHe insists his interest in fashion goes deeper than the attendant perks. “I’m not just in it for the free clothing,” he said. To seek inspiration for his 3x1 collection, for instance, the athlete traveled to Japan for a crash course on the craft of denim production.\nThough sidelined by an injury a year ago, Mr. Cruz has been working his way back onto the field. As befits an athlete of his stature, he believes that fitness and fashion go hand-in-hand. “Staying in shape is definitely what’s going to give you the confidence to wear the clothes that you want,” he said. Here, Mr. Cruz gives us the play-by-play on the rest of his wardrobe strategy.\nENLARGE Clockwise from bottom left: an Ovadia & Sons s/s 2016 runway look; Kith varsity jacket; Hugo Boss suit; Rolex watch; Thom Browne sweatpants; Public School shirt; brooch; stickpin; a Fall 2015 Ovadia & Sons runway look; Berluti shoes Photo: Marko Metzinger for The Wall Street Journal (shirt, sweatpants, shoes, brooch & stickpin); F.

They give me that feeling of security, of strength.” Public School Shirt, $495, saksfifthavenue.com\nGilt Milestone\n“A gold Rolex was my first big purchase when I made it to the NFL.

It’s great.”\nTailored Bling\n“With suiting I like to take risks so I try things such as lapel pins.
