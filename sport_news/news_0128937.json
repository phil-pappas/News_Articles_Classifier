It was announced on Wednesday that Joseph had suffered a season-ending knee injury. Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 4:00 am WVU loses Karl Joseph to season-ending knee injury By Bob Hertzel For the Times West Virginian Times West Virginian \nMORGANTOWN — West Virginia University safety Karl Joseph’s spectacular season, and probably his collegiate career, came to a shocking end on Tuesday when he suffered a torn ACL in his right knee during a non-contract practice drill. \nSurgery is expected to be performed on the knee next week, following the Mountaineers’ sold-out 7 p.m. homecoming game against unbeaten Oklahoma State. \n“I am devastated and heartbroken for Karl,” an openly emotional coach Dana Holgorsen said. “He is a young man who has given everything he has to our football program and university over the past four years and who elected to return to WVU for his senior season to earn his degree and to be a part of something special with this team. He exemplifies what it means to be a Mountaineer. Karl is an All-American, a fierce competitor, a leader, and I know he will have a full recovery, and I can’t wait to watch him on Sundays next fall.” \nDurable and among the hardest hitters in all of college football, Joseph has been a four-year fixture in the Mountaineer secondary as the defense went from one of college football’s worst to among the better defenses in the game. \nJoseph has started all 42 games of his career and logged an incredible 3,388 plays, including 2,980 on defense. He has produced 284 tackles, including 209 solo stops, 16.5 tackles for loss, two sacks, nine interceptions, 14 pass breakups, eight forced fumbles and six fumble recoveries. \nJoseph, a first team All-Big 12 performer in 2014, was having an outstanding year to date, playing at an All-America level, leading the nation in interceptions (5), No. 23 in passes \ndefended and No. 27 in fumbles recovered. This season, he is No. 2 on the Mountaineer defense in tackles with 20, including 15 solo stops. He also has a sack, two tackles for loss, a pass breakup and a fumble recovery. \n“I want to thank my teammates and my coaches for their outpouring of support,” Joseph said. “This has been difficult for me and my family, but I know I will come through this stronger than ever. I will forever be a Mountaineer and will be cheering on our team every step of the way.” \nJoseph was named National Player of the Week by the Football Writers Association of America, Jim Thorpe Defensive Back of the Week and the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 1 against Georgia Southern. He was awarded the game ball by Holgorsen after putting up eight tackles, with three interceptions in the third quarter and a recovered fumble. \nHe finished second on the team with 92 tackles as a junior and led WVU as a sophomore with four fumble recoveries, ranking No. 2 nationally. He also had 68 tackles, five pass breakups and three tackles for loss. Joseph was named a freshman All-American and WVU’s Defensive Player of the Year in 2012 after leading the Mountaineers in tackles (104), solo tackles (76) and tied for the team lead in forced fumbles (3) and interceptions (2). \nA revised depth chart lists either Jarrod Harper or Jeremy Tyler, both juniors who have extensive experience, as potential replacements for Joseph. \nThe timing of the injury could not have been worse, the Mountaineers coming off their first loss of the season, 44-24 at Oklahoma, and in the midst of a four-game run in which they play all nationally ranked teams. \nOklahoma State comes to Morgantown ranked No. 21/19. WVU then travels to play No. 3 Baylor and, after a week off, plays a Thursday night game at TCU. \nFollow Bob Hertzel on Twitter @bhertzel.
