Just 25 seconds before the half, Easton fired a 14-yarder to Taylor Barthelette . In the second half, he found Jose Depadua for a 22-yard score and closed the game with a 26-yard throw to Hunter Taute after Duquesne failed to convert an onside kick. \nThe Dukes' (4-3, 1-1) Sam Martello intercepted Easton and ran it back 42 yards. \nCoaches had predicted the teams would finish 1-2 in the Northeast. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:03:02.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
