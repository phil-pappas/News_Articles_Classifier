But it’s not the winning streak that’s proving most impressive, it’s the sheer and utter domination Djokovic has left in his path, starting with the back half of his U.S. Open finals match against Federer.\nAdChoices Here are the scores of each set Djokovic has played since losing the second set to Federer in last month’s Open final: 6-4, 6-4, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 (6), 6-1.\nThat’s 18 sets (and not in featherweight matches either: six of the nine matches were against top 20 players). Take away the two against Federer and, starting with the next match, he won 14 sets in a row by a score of 6-3 or better. (That was snapped in Friday’s first-set tiebreak against Bernard Tomic.) He dropped a breadstick (6-1) in five of those sets. Thirteen of the 18 sets had a score of 6-2 or better. He was only just recently pushed to a seventh game or a tiebreak, but then followed that up with a 6-1 closer.\nSome other dominant stats:\n1. Djokovic is 29-0 in the Beijing tournament, winning 58 sets and dropping just three.\n2. He’s 22-3 in Shanghai, making him 51-3 overall in China.\n3. The world No. 1 has won 34 of his past 35 matches in China, with the only loss coming to Federer in last year’s Shanghai final.\n4. Djokovic has made 12 straight finals since before the Australian Open, going 8-4 in those matches.\n5. Add up the rankings points of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, John Isner and Nick Kyrgios and you still wouldn’t pass Djokovic.\n6. And we’ve saved the best for last (via Andrew Burton ): In 2007 in Miami, Novak Djokovic won his first Masters 1000 title. Since then, no player younger than Djokovic has won one of those titles. The Djoker is the youngest of the Big Four (Murray has him by a week) and in those eight years, no one else has risen to the challenge.\nHow long ago was that? Just as a frame of reference, Rafael Nadal was still dressing like a pirate in capris.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/burtonad/status/655016808601157632"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:42:29.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
