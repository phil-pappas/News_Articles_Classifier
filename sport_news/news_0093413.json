That group has now decided to bring the first reading of the electronic ban for drivers to the full city council. \nA second reading is tentatively scheduled for November 10. That would be the date where the council could hear public input. \nThis ban does have a few expectations including for people in emergency vehicles; they could still use phones while performing official duties. The ban also allows all drivers to use hands-free modes of operation. \n14 states in the U.S. ban talking while on a handheld cell phone when driving. 36 states do not have any sort of bans against talking and driving. Four states have partial bans; many of those are tied to young drivers. Several cities across the country have their own bans on the books. \nStates That Ban Using Handheld Cell Phones While Driving Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
