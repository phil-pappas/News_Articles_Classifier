But that was before Jon Lester was signed and Joe Maddon arrived in “Cousin Eddie,” improving their chances to 16-1.\nWith eight victories standing between them and history, the Cubs are now as low as 8-5 with some sports books to win the 2015 World Series.\nThe Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook had the Cubs at 40-1 before the season. They are now listed at 5-2. MGM has them at 8-5.\nWhen the playoffs began, the Cubs were 25-2 to win the World Series, while the Blue Jays were the favorite at 5-1. But after eliminating the Pirates and Cardinals—teams with the two-best records in MLB—the Cubs overtook the Jays (now 2-1) as the slight favorite, according to VegasInsider.com. The Royals are 3-1.\nBookmakers stand to lose a bunch if the Cubs end their championship drought, but the losses can’t possibly exceed their gains from all the Cubbies’ losing seasons.", "external_links": ["http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2014/12/cubs-to-sign-jon-lester.html", "http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/cubs-interviewed-joe-maddon-at-rv-park-220834691.html", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-07/why-las-vegas-needs-the-chicago-cubs-to-lose-tonight"], "published": "2015-10-15T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:41:31.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
