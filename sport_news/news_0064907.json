Evans visited campus over the weekend, and was sold on the possibility of contributing immediately next season.\n\"You know, with them losing Trey Freeman it really made it clear to me that I have a possibility of coming in and starting and playing a lot my first year, playing lead guard like he does,\" Evans said.\nEvans, who committed to Oklahoma State last October before re-opening his recruitment, said although that he's a more natural point guard, he can play either backcourt spot.\n\"I can shoot it well enough and do other things and play and guard the two (position) if need be,\" he said. \"I would say I'm a combo guard.\"\nEvans plays for his father, former University of Oklahoma guard Terry Evans, at Edmond North High. He is the third member of ODU's 2016 class, joining 6-6 Xavier Green of Williamsburg Christian and 6-4 Randy Haynes of New Mexico Junior College. ODU has one more scholarship to give and is pursuing big men, including 6-9 junior college forward Allasane Kah, who visited campus last month.\n\"It was my first time on the east coast,\" Evans said. \"I felt like I really got along well with all the guys, and I'm a big fan of what the coaches are doing there.\"\n \n \n \n\nFrom ED MILLER'S ODU HOOPS BLOG Subscribe to RSS headline updates from: \nPowered by FeedBurner\nMORE COLLEGE BASKETBALL Men | Women AP Top 25 | Stats \nFollow @edmillervp Posted to : College Basketball Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:32:15.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
