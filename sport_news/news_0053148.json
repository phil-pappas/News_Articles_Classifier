Jennifer Becknell news@enquirerherald.com i Order Reprint of this Story YORK \nStudents and staff in the York school district wore orange to represent unity against bullying Wednesday, part of a month of special events planned to target the problem. \nBox Out Bullying, a traveling theatrical program that defines bullying and explains what students can do, was presented to seventh- and eighth-graders at York Middle School on Wednesday. \n“Theater is a very effective medium,” said Jerry Rubenstein, founder and creative director of Pennsylvania-based Box Out Bullying, which combines research-based bullying prevention with live theater. “We believe theater maximizes the message.” \nRubenstein and Kyle Masteller presented a 50-minute interactive program that incoporated humor as it laid out the definition of bullying, talked about what students can do if they see someone bullied or are bullied themselves, and encouraged them to use empathy. \n“This is a very serious topic,” said Rubenstein, who created the program in 2008 at the request of school educators. “But we want to make it a celebration of the positive school cuture.” \nThe events are part of the York school district’s Olweus Bullying Prevention program, which includes classroom meetings, school-wide rules about bullying and other activities spearheaded by the school Bullying Implementation Committees and based on survey data for each school. \nA Bigger than Bullying 5K will be Nov. 21. The 5K was first organized last year by three York Comprehensive High School students who wanted to spread awareness. The project won state honors in DECA for community service and won a National PACER Award last spring. Runners and walkers are welcome. \nThe bullying prevention program implementation began with a federally grant spearheaded by Sue Hilton, coordinator of counseling services. \nFor more information on Box Out Bullying, visit boxoutbullying.com.
