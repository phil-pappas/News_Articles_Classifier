Deon Washington.\nThe dog may have been in the crate in urine and fecal matter for several weeks, up to several months, caregivers said. Based on the dog’s health when he was found, he had not been fed or given water in several days.\nThe dog’s injuries were extensive, including urine scald over most of his body, according to Dr. Solveig Evans, who treated the dog. The fur on his face was one solid mat. He was barely able to open his mouth because of the matting, Evans said. The dog, which authorities estimated to be about 2 years old, would whine in pain any time it was touched because of the condition of its fur and skin.\nNamed Adam by staffers at the animal shelter, the dog has been completely shaved of all matting and placed on IV fluids. Once he is stabilized at the shelter, a local rescue group will take Adam and care for him. The dog will need 24-hour medical care that cannot be provided at the shelter, Washington said. Despite his present condition, Adam may be able to make a full recovery and have a normal life, caregivers said.\nGwinnett County authorities are offering up to a $2,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and indictment in his case.\nIf anyone has any information, contact the Gwinnett County Animal Shelter at 770 339-3200.
