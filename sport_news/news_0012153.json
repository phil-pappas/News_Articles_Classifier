Dipoto's first priority is hiring a manager after Lloyd McClendon was fired last week following two years in charge.\nKingston has been Seattle's assistant general manager for the past six seasons and served as the interim GM for the final month of the regular season after Jack Zduriencik was fired. McNamara has been Seattle's director of amateur scouting for the past seven seasons and Allison the Mariners' head of pro scouting for the last three seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:50:18.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
