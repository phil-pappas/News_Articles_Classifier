Moton has led the Eagles to a 107-53 (56-8, MEAC) record through five years, including a trip to the NCAA Tournament in 2014. \nOnly one starter from last year’s team — redshirt senior Dante Holmes — returns to the Eagles this season. \nThe Baltimore, Md., native averaged a career-high 10.4 points and led the team with 1.3 steals per game. Moton said this season’s Eagle squad is like a trust fund baby who cashes in on his father’s hard work. \"They are the recipients and the sole beneficiaries of what the previous teams have done,” Moton said. “I told them, ‘You've been given the keys to a Porsche, and you can't crash it, you have to bring it back with a full tank of gas.’\" \nAlong with new season expectations, the Eagles will be welcomed by new aesthetics at McDougald-McLendon Gymnasium. \nLED lighting, a Jumbotron and a new center-court surface — the first replacement floor since the building opened in 1950 — will soon be on display in Durham. \nMoton said the upgrades are just pieces of the puzzle he envisioned when he took the reins of the NC Central basketball program six years ago. \"My mother always told me being a visionary is kind of tough because the gift is you're the only one who can see your vision,” Moton said. “And the curse is you're the only one who can see your vision. Fortunately, I've had some really good basketball players, our chancellor and our athletic director, who all helped enhance this program.\" \nMoton and the Eagles will open their preseason slate against Clemson on Nov. 13 at 7 p.m., a neutral site matchup at Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, S.C.
