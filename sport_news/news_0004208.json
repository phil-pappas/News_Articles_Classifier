A bye week followed wins over Griffin Christian (55-0) and Georgia Christian (27-7) while now heading into the final five games of the Region 1-AAA schedule. \n“It came at a great time in the season,” Matthews said of last week’s bye. “What we told the kids is that it wasn’t a week off. It was a week where we were going to work extremely hard. We told them we’re going to work harder and faster than we have been to get ready for the second half of the season.” \nWhile Trinity (3-2, 1-0) defeated Holy Spirit in last year’s meeting at home 28-7, Matthews and the Lions expect Friday’s second region contest set for Friday in Atlanta to be a lot tougher than the first against Griffin Christian where it scored all of its points by halftime. \nLike Trinity, Holy Spirit also dominated winless Griffin Christian last week in a 43-0 rout, with Matthews getting a look at what could be in store this week against the Cougars, now 3-3 overall and 2-1 in 1-AAA play. \nFollowing a 34-0 loss to unbeaten Loganville, Holy Spirit has outscored Bethlehem Christian and Griffin Christian by a combined 73-6 margin. \nBoth defenses have done a solid job of limiting opponents over the past four weeks. Outside of a 49-21 loss to two-time defending GISA Class AAA champion Westfield, Trinity has allowed 13 points since game two. The Lions kept an opponent to one score or less for the third time on Sept. 18, while closing out the non-region portion of the regular season with a 27-7 win over Georgia Christian. \n“That’s just part of the season in that you’ve got to continue to build positives,” said Matthews of his first year with the Lions. “We’ve got some players who have gotten really comfortable in their positions. Then we’ve looked at a couple of places where we’re moving guys to help creating more competition and help our overall depth.” \nSeniors Bryan Mocarski and Ryan Durham have led this year’s offense for Holy Spirit under head coach David Rosenweig. “They’re really efficient in running the ball,” Matthews said. “It’s kind of like Georgia Tech. They’ll go two receivers and they’ll run a lot of option. They’ll run some counters and some straight dives.” \nThe Cougars are coming off a 4-6 season where the team went 3-4 in region play and just missed reaching the GISA state playoffs in fifth place. \nHoly Spirit is averaging just over 25 points a game with just Trinity, Heritage School (3-3, 2-0) and Dominion (0-5, 0-2) left on the region schedule. This season, seven programs are vying for four playoff berths following the departure of Young Americans as a GISA member. \nOutside of its shutout loss to Loganville, Holy Spirit has held three of its last four opponents to six points or less. Last year’s defense finished with 16 sacks, 12 caused fumbles and 10 interceptions. The Cougars lost standout linebacker Drew Vincent (67 tackles, 2 sacks) to graduation, but return linebacker Derrick Gomez and lineman Chris Bell, who combined for five sacks last year. \nTrinity senior running back Joseph Cotton has a touchdown in all five games so far this season.
