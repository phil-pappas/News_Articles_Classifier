Cherington will teach a spring class on leadership in sports at Columbia. \"The addition of Ben to our Columbia program, reflects our commitment to building a curriculum that combines the real world experiences of sports industry leaders, with the academic rigor of an Ivy League University. Ben and I will continue to explore additional ways in which he can add value to our students and our program,\" said Vince Gennaro, the program's director, in a press release. \"I'm honored to join the team at Columbia,\" Cherington said in the release. \"Two of my favorite parts of working in baseball have been to collaborate with outstanding people looking to make a difference, and, to help others grow. I hope sharing my experience can help play a small role in Columbia's mission to prepare its students for a meaningful and impactful career in the sports industry.\" Cherington decided not to stay on as Boston's general manager after the team hired Dave Dombrowski to be its president of baseball operations above him on the organizational hierarchy. When he stepped down, Cherington talked about the possibility of taking some time off from working in baseball itself, and he bypassed chances to go after GM openings the last few months. \"We’ll give this some time and figure out the next thing,\" Cherington said on Aug. 12. \"It’s been basically my adult life has been spent at Fenway Park, so that’s been great. But it’s time to do something else and probably time to get a little separation from Fenway Park before I make that decision.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:22:07.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
