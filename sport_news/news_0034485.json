Flood conveyed a similar message in the locker room, which was met with a jubilant celebration by the players. \n\"I know this for a fact and you can't even question it, you guys stayed together in a game where 90 percent of the teams out there would have had no chance to do what you did in the first half, let alone what you did in the second half,\" Flood said in a video posted by Rutgers. \"That's special. And you finished. And you finished. In life, men, if you can learn to finish, there's nothing you can't do. I can't tell you how proud I am of you. I love you.\" \nRELATED: 10 takeaways from Rutgers' win over Indiana \nThe dramatic win came in Flood's return to the sideline after a three-game suspension for violating a university compliance policy. If the result had any more meaning to Flood due to the circumstances, he didn't reveal that in his postgame press conference. \n\"Being on the sideline feels the way it always does,\" Flood said. \"It's one of the best days of the year. We're only guaranteed 12 of them a year so it was great to be out there. I love being out there with the team. It's a great group of young people to work with.\" \nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21 .
