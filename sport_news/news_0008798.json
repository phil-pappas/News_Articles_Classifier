The key to winning on DraftKings and FanDuel is finding a way to think differently than everyone else. \nEach week, we pick a few sleepers to consider on FanDuel or DraftKings. In Week 6, these guys are a bit undervalued. DraftKings \nAndy Dalton, quarterback, Cincinnati Bengals ($5,700) \nThe Buffalo Bills could provide a tough test for the Cincinnati Bengals' offense, but Andy Dalton is rolling right now. The Bills are going to have their hands full covering all of the Bengals' offensive weapons, and Dalton is still reasonably cheap on DraftKings. It's worth riding the hot hand until he cools down. \nDuke Johnson, running back, Cleveland Browns ($4,500) \nDuke Johnson is finally getting healthy, and he's catching a ton of passes lately. The Broncos' defense isn't easy to churn out yards against, but if the Browns are trailing, Johnson will get a lot of play in the passing game. At a reasonable price, he's worth rolling the dice on for the upside potential of his garbage time stats. \nAntonio Gates, tight end, San Diego Chargers ($4,600) \nAntonio Gates burst back onto the scene after returning from suspension last week, and his price on DraftKings is still reasonable. Even after nine catches for 92 yards and two touchdowns, Gates is priced at $4,600 on DraftKings. He plays against a reasonably tough Packers defense, but it's worth riding the hot hand. FanDuel \nSam Bradford, quarterback, Philadelphia Eagles ($7,700) \nIt seems the Eagles' offense is finally getting off the ground. Over the last two games, Sam Bradford has over 600 passing yards, five touchdowns and two interceptions. The Giants are playing some tough defense, but Bradford seems to finally be figuring things out. His price has dropped into the range to make him a bargain. \nAllen Robinson, wide receiver, Jacksonville Jaguars ($6,700) \nAllen Robinson is quietly putting together a strong season for fantasy football owners. The Jaguars are often playing from behind, giving Blake Bortles and Robinson a chance to pile up stats in garbage time. Against the Texans, Robinson should be able to continue his productive ways, and he's still not priced accordingly on FanDuel. \nDanny Woodhead, running back, San Diego Chargers ($6,000) \nThe Packers are favored over the Chargers by 10 points, and if the game goes that way, Danny Woodhead could be heavily involved in the offense. For $6,000, Woodhead is worth a shot. Woodhead is a lock for somewhere between three and six catches and could end up with double-digit carries. With that type of usage, he'll out-perform his price tag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:56:20.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
