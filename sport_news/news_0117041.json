Thank you boys,” he said as he pointed to the team.\nIt was during the game that Red Sox players decided to salute Orsillo after the final out.\n“We’re happy to do it just to show him a little bit of love and respect for what he’s done for us,” said utility man Brock Holt. “He doesn’t take his job too seriously, but he’s really good at it. Just being around him, he’s a good person. We’re going to miss him and everyone that watches him on TV is going to miss his voice calling the games for sure.”\nNESN will replace Orsillo with Dave O’Brien next season. The announcement was ill-timed and NESN received plenty of negative feedback over how it was handled. Orsillo has since taken a job with the San Diego Padres for next season.\nOrsillo’s final broadcast was filled with “Classic Moments” that NESN aired in and out of breaks as well as plenty of reminiscing between Orsillo and longtime partner Remy. There was also a plane that flew over Progressive Field, which read “Red Sox Nation loves Don Orsillo.”\nRemy — whose future role with NESN also seems a bit uncertain — was effusive, and at times emotional, when talking about Orsillo on the broadcast.\n“I value your professionalism in the job and also the fact we’re very good friends,” Remy told him at one point. “I want to thank you for all the fun moments we’ve had and the friendship. It’s a tough day for everybody. It really is. I wish you the best in San Diego, but my friend it’s been a lot of fun.”\nThe moments aired ranged from some of Orsillo’s important calls — a handful of no-hitters, David Ortiz homers and Manny Ramirez highlights — to classic Remy-Orsillo shtick.\nOrsillo addressed the TV audience late in the game. He referenced the first Red Sox game he ever attended and being able to work with Ken Coleman (as an intern) and with Joe Castiglione on the radio.\n“I want to thank my friend and partner for 15 years,” he said to Remy, his longtime broadcast partner. “We’ve been through so much on and off the field and we’re best friends.”\nOrsillo left his last remarks for the fans.\n“Thank you for your incredible support and loyalty,” he said, calling last Sunday at Fenway the greatest memory of his career. “I heard all of you and will never forget your words. They touched me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:32:17.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
