But following a couple of days of “excruciating pain,” he began to feel a lot better. \n“I think it was right after somebody hit a home run in Texas, and we were winning,” Cecil recalled. “George was right next to me. I looked at him and I said, ‘George, I’m going to pitch in the World Series.’ He said, ‘OK, sounds good.’ ” \nAt that moment, the Jays were still playing an elimination game in the ALDS. But after taking three straight from the Rangers, they’re in Kansas City, getting ready for Game 1 of the championship series against the Royals on Friday night. \nAnd as his teammates worked out Thursday, Cecil threw in the outfield, with Poulis catching, for the second straight day. He said he was pain-free. But understandably, he feels weakness in the calf muscle, especially when he balances on his left leg during his windup. \n“When I bring my leg up, I can feel my leg shaking a bit,” he said. \nCecil said he thinks he could pitch off a mound now, but believes the biggest challenge will come when he has to bounce off the mound to field a bunt or ground ball, or when he has to run, as he did when he injured the muscle while making a tag during a rundown. \nThere is no precise timetable for his rehab. But he is delighted with his progress so far, and credits the training staff’s regimen of treatment and resistance exercises. \nThe Blue Jays’ first three starters will work on normal rest in the American League Championship Series, with R.A. Dickey getting an extra three days. \nMarco Estrada will start Game 1 here Friday night, with David Price to follow on Saturday. After a travel day, the series moves to the Rogers Centre, with Marcus Stroman starting Game 3 and Dickey working on seven days’ rest in Game 4. \nManager John Gibbons said reliever Aaron Loup, who missed the last two division series games to deal with a family matter, will be back for the ALCS. \n*** \nWhen the Jays and Royals last met, Toronto took three of four at the Rogers Centre and went on an 11-game win streak. The series finale was fractious, with Josh Donaldson getting hit twice and Troy Tulowitzki once. Toronto’s Aaron Sanchez was ejected after he hit Alcides Escobar, sparking a benches-clearing incident and a three-game suspension. \nRoyals manager Ned Yost said his pitchers will “pitch inside aggressively” to the Jays. Naturally, both he and Toronto skipper John Gibbons said they do not expect more bad blood. \n“You get careless out there and you do something stupid, it could cost your team a big game,” Gibbons said. \nEdinson Volquez, KC’s Game 1 starter, was the pitcher who hit Donaldson and Tulowitzki on Aug. 2 and was one of the more riled players when the benches cleared. Afterward, he called Donaldson “a little baby” for complaining about head-high pitches. \n*** \nDuring Thursday’s media scrums, Kansas City writers raised repeated questions about Jose Bautista’s exaggerated bat flip after his game-winning homer Wednesday night. Manager John Gibbons said he’s no fan of extravagant on-field celebrations in sports, but understands why fans enjoy them. \n“It’s not a conservative society much anymore, which is a shame,” he said, making it clear he’d prefer to discuss another topic. \nEstrada’s reply: “If it happened off of me, then it sucks, but that’s the way baseball is. I’m not really a guy that shows too much emotion out on the mound. If I strike someone out I’m not jumping around. If I make a bad pitch and someone crushes it, I’ll tip my hat to that and I guess you can do whatever you want.” \nYost said he understands high-stakes game generate a lot of emotion, but said he wants his players to “respect the game.” \nVolquez said bat-flips used to irritate him, but now he accepts them. \n“Why not? You can’t get crazy with it,” Volquez said. “You can’t take that pitch back. The ball is gone.” © Copyright (c) National Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:56:25.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
