(Seth Wenig/Associated Press) \nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — With their roster ravaged by injury and the seven-man game-day inactive list filled by players who weren’t healthy enough to dress for Sunday’s contest against the New York Jets, the Washington Redskins had quarterback Robert Griffin III suit up for the first time this season. \nGriffin never got in the game, nor was he expected to as the third string quarterback. But he completed his usual pregame warmup and throwing routine, and instead of watching the game from the sideline in street clothes, he did so in uniform. And, as has been his custom this season, he paced the sidelines and cheered for teammates throughout the game, which Washington lost, 34-20. \n[ Game story: Depleted Redskins run ragged by Jets in second half ] \nThe quarterback, benched as the starter with a week left in the preseason, briefly spoke to reporters after the game, and said news that he would dress for the game came as a surprise. \n“I’m here to support; support the team, whoever’s starting, whoever’s playing. So, that’s not my call,” Griffin said. “I was not expecting it. You obviously come in here and expect to win, so I wasn’t expecting that at all.” \nIt became evident that Griffin would likely dress for the game when Redskins officials ruled rookie running back Matt Jones out with a sprained big toe early Sunday morning. That left Washington with only 46 healthy players to fill out the 46-man active game-day roster. \nThe Redskins haven’t permitted Griffin to speak to reporters since his demotion to third string. But because he dressed for the game, senior vice president of communications Tony Wyllie allowed Griffin to field questions from reporters. \n[ Best and worst moments from the Redskins’ loss to the Jets ] \nAfter he discussed his surprise about dressing for the game, Griffin was asked if the last five weeks have been difficult for him. But he refused to shed insight on the matter. \n“Nah, man, I’m not going to talk about myself, our team, we need to win next week,” he said. “That’s all we’re focused on. I’m not focused on what I’ve had to go through or anything like that. We’re just focused on Tampa Bay for next week. Get ready to go. We’ve got to get a win before the bye.” Mike Jones covers the Washington Redskins for The Washington Post.
