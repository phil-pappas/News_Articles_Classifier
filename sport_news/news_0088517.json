A team source said Jackson was not injured and was brought back to the team facility. The team confirmed that Jackson was driving the car. \nLiebman said police were called at 4:49 p.m. Jackson waited for police to arrive, was cooperative and then was taken to the Seahawks’ facility, the Virginia Mason Athletic Center. \nIn a statement released Tuesday night, Renton police said: “Early news releases indicated that Jackson was racing another team member and was removed from the scene by team security before officers could investigate. These reports are false. As of this time, there is no indication that Jackson was racing another vehicle.” \nJackson tweeted about the crash Tuesday night: “Thanks 2 everyone worried about me. I lost control of my car. My teammates, including Marshawn, stopped 2 check on me. They weren’t racin me” \nA few onlookers gathered periodically at the scene of the accident, with the car blocking the street while nestled against a stop sign. It was across the street from the sign that greets visitors to Renton and touts the Seahawks’ standing as the NFC champions. \nThe scene of the accident was around a quarter-mile from the team facility. Tire tracks were visible in the dirt in front of the “Welcome to Renton” sign. Sitting next to it were remnants of the street sign for Ripley Lane and Seahawks Way, which the car apparently ripped out before crossing the street and plowing into a stop sign. \nJackson, 34, was signed as a free agent Sept. 7 to add depth at tailback after Robert Turbin was injured. Jackson is the third-leading rusher in Buffalo Bills history with 5,127 yards, behind Thurman Thomas and O.J. Simpson. \nIn Buffalo Jackson became close friends with Lynch, as both played in the backfield for the Bills from 2007 until early in the 2010 season when Lynch was traded to the Seahawks. \nJackson has played in all six games this season. He has 52 yards on 10 carries and 110 yards on 12 receptions, including a touchdown against Green Bay. Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
