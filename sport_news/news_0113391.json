What do you think?

We’re disappointed with the way we defended. \n“We had a good spell in the first half at 1-1 and looked like the team that was going to go on and do something. \n“With key moments in the game, a a team you’ve got to have the experience and game management to see that out and unfortunately we’ve not done that.” \nWolves now host Brentford and Middlesbrough in successive games over the next six days as they look to get back on track. Jackett’s team are 11th in the standings, five points away from the play-offs. \nAnd on-loan Cardiff striker Le Fondre said it was important that the team reacted positively after the Derby defeat. \n“We’ve got to react now as a team and show big character, it’s what the Championship’s all about,” he added. Adam Le Fondre of Wolverhampton Wanderers and George Thorne of Derby County \n“There are two quality teams coming up, Brentford were fantastic last season and have had an indifferent start and changed manager, but they’re always going to pose a threat. \n“Obviously Middlesbrough are not too dissimilar to Derby in that they’ve spent a lot of money and have a lot of quality and will be a good test for us at home. \n“But on the day our team’s brilliant at home. If we cut out the defensive errors as a team we’ll be right up there.” \nFor Wolves manager Kenny Jackett, it was a rude awakening after the side’s run of back-to-back 3-0 wins, which were part of a four-match unbeaten run. \n“Derby away is always a tough game, but just accepting their qualities isn’t something we just do – we have to improve and try to get better,” he said. “You have to have a realism when you come here that your work around your own box needs to be better than it was.
