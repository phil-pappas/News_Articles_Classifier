Aspas beat Getafe's offside trap a minute later but his shot bounced off the near post. \nArgentina defender Santiago Vergini earned a yellow card in the 43rd when he obstructed Aspas' forward pass with his hand, stopping a move which would have left the Celta forward alone facing Guaita. \nCelta forward Manuel \"Nolito\" Agudo was unable to improve on his league-leading eight-goal tally when Guaita saved two good shots in the 65th. \nGetafe broke forward on the counterattack in the 71st but Stefan Scepovic's header bounced off the top off the crossbar. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:59:05.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
