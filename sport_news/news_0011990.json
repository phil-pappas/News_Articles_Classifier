Online ticketing sites like Fandango crashed amid the demand. \nJ.J. Abrams' film is shrouded in secrecy, and thus the teasers and trailers have become events in and of themselves — the last has over 64 million views on YouTube. \n\"Monday Night Football\" airs on ESPN, which, like Lucasfilm, is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:09:56.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
