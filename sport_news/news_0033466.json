LOUIS (AP) - John Lackey gets the start in Game 1 of the NL Division Series for the St. Louis Cardinals on Friday.\nAt the beginning of a two-hour workout for the NL Central champions on Tuesday, manager Mike Matheny said he was not ready to announce the rest of his playoff rotation or his roster. Matheny said he will likely reveal the roster after a workout Thursday.\nThe 36-year-old Lackey went 9-4 with a 1.93 ERA in 17 starts at home. Overall, he was 13-10 with a 2.77 ERA - the first sub 3.00 ERA of his big career.\nMatheny has Jaime Garcia (10-6, 2.43), Lance Lynn (12-11, 3.03) and Michael Wacha (17-7, 3.38) for Games 2, 3 and 4, in some order. Wacha could be pushed back after going 2-3 with a 7.88 ERA in five September starts.\nBLUES-GOMEZ \nBlues sign Scott Gomez to 1-year contract\nST. LOUIS (AP) - The St. Louis Blues signed forward Scott Gomez to a one-year contract Wednesday.\nThe 35-year-old Gomez, a 15-year NHL veteran, attended training camp on a professional tryout. He had seven goals and 27 assists in 58 games last season for New Jersey.\nSt. Louis added forward Scottie Upshall on Monday, also after a tryout.\nThe Blues placed forward Patrik Berglund on long-term injured reserve. Berglund underwent shoulder surgery in August and will be evaluated in four months.\nSt. Louis said defenseman Alex Pietrangelo and forward Alexander Steen will be assistant captains.\nTITANS-GREEN-BECKHAM ARRESTED \nTitans rookie says he thought stop was warning, not ticket\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Titans rookie wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham says he thought police gave him a warning only for speeding as he left a hospital following his son's birth in July and was surprised to learn of an outstanding warrant when stopped in Missouri during Tennessee's bye week.\nGreen-Beckham said Wednesday it was a misunderstanding because he had no idea a ticket had been issued.\nPolice in Van Buren, Missouri, stopped the rookie Sept. 30 for driving 65 in a 55-mph zone on his way home to visit family, and they discovered an outstanding warrant for speeding from Osage Beach, Missouri.\nGreen-Beckham says he found out the hard way about the warrant, which he resolved by paying $92 in cash.\nThe receiver was given a warning only by Van Buren police.\nCUBS-PIRATES \nArrieta, Cubs silence Pirates 4-0 to win NL wild-card game\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - Jake Arrieta allowed four hits in nine dominant innings and the Chicago Cubs rolled to a 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL wild-card game on Wednesday night.\nArrieta struck out 11 without a walk. He also dusted off getting plunked by Pittsburgh reliever Tony Watson to send the Cubs to the NL Division Series in St. Louis starting on Friday.\nDexter Fowler homered and scored three times for the Cubs. Kyle Schwarber added a towering two-run shot off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole as Chicago raced to an early lead and let Arrieta do the rest.\nThe largest crowd ever at PNC Park failed to rattle Arrieta or one of baseball's youngest teams. Manager Joe Maddon's club played with swagger and confidence and looked right at home while snapping a nine-game playoff losing streak that dated to the 2003 NL Championship Series.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
