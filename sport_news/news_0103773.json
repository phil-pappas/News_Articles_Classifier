The Governor set the deadline after receiving a report from the state Vigilance Commission that highlighted callous approach of various government departments in such cases. The report pointed out that many such cases had been hanging fire for years. An official spokesperson said: “Disturbed by the report recently tendered by the CVC, the Governor has noted that a large number of complaints/inquiries referred by the CVC to various government departments have been pending for the past several years without any reasons given.” Vohra has advised the government to issue directions to the “Departmental Vigilance Officers to ensure disposal of all pending complaints relating to corruption in their respective departments in a time-bound manner so as to achieve zero pendency by March, 31, 2016.” The Raj Bhavan Secretariat has sought regular monthly report on action taken and results achieved in that regard. Sources said more than 800 queries had been made in various corruption cases. However, only 35 of these were responded to. The Vigilance Department asked government wings to act in all such cases, particularly those related to the engineering, forest and pollution control departments, but officials concerned didn’t move. Last year, the State Vigilance Organisation booked seven persons, including an IAS officer and Director of Economic Reconstruction Agency (ERA), for alleged illegal allotment and grabbing of a prime piece of land of the Jammu Development Authority (JDA), sources said. The case was registered after an inquiry was conducted into the allegation of illegal allotment of a plot at Sector 1-A in Trikuta Nagar, Jammu, and grabbing of some land, sources said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:03:04.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
