(Photo: Jae S. Lee / The Tennessean) \nSafety Kevin Byard, who is one interception from breaking the school record for most in a career, knows the team will have to clean up mistakes and force turnovers against the Panthers. \n\"He's a good quarterback, and he think he definitely has some good athletes that he can get the ball to. \n“He makes good decisions with the ball.” \nLast week against Western Kentucky, several Blue Raider defenders missed tackles in open space on the field, which led to big plays for the Hilltoppers. \nDefensive coordinator Tyrone Nix was not happy and said his squad will need to focus on fundamentals to help MTSU avoid a 2-5 record midway through the season. \n“We had a lot of small mistakes that led to big plays,” Nix said. “(McGough) is sharp with the ball, and he’s elusive also. \n“He doesn’t look like an elusive guy, but he’s hard to sack and runs the offense really well.” \nNix said one of the areas MTSU will have to pay attention to Saturday is the middle of the field. \nTight end Ya'Keem Griner is one of McGough’s favorite target’s with 20 receptions for 221 yards and two touchdowns on the year. \n“I think the tight end might be the best player on the offense,” Nix said. “They find different ways to get him the ball, and we’ll have to find out where he’s at on every play.” \nReach Aldo Amato at 615-278-5109 and on Twitter @Aldo_ Amato \nOpponent: FIU", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:30:12.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
