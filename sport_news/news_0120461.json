These two teams shouldn’t have played today.” \n“This game had a finals atmosphere and this really should have been the final,” Voorhees coach Taylor Vidak said. \nVoorhees captured the first meeting between the teams 2-1 in overtime on the Blue Streaks’ turf field on Sept. 15. \n‘We won on their turf and they beat us on our grass,” Voorhees assistant coach Ann Bonavita said. “This should have been the final.” \nVidak says she hates to see such an important game between two great teams come down to strokes. \n“It’s really unfortunate to have two teams of this caliber decide a game on strokes,” Vidak said. “I don’t think that’s the best way to do it, but that’s the way the rules are and you have to make the most of it.” \nVoorhees’ Claire Whiston nearly won the game in the second overtime period but her apparent goal was nullified because of pushing violation. \n“I didn’t see it (the push),” Vidak said. “It’s unfortunate because she made a great shot.” \nOn the surface, Warren Hills-Voorhees would have been the ultimate final. At the end of the day, you can only plays who’s on you scheduled and the Blue Streaks were up to the task on Saturday. \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
