It tied the mark set by David Healy of Northern Ireland in Euro 2008 qualifying. \nIreland finished three points behind Poland, but can still qualify for the Euros via a playoff. \nGermany was unconvincing for long periods against Georgia and had to wait until Mueller's penalty in the 50th minute to make the breakthrough. Georgia captain Jaba Kankava equalized three minutes later, only for Kruse to claim the winner in the 79th. \nIn Warsaw, Grzegorz Krychowiak fired Poland ahead in the 13th, only for Jon Walters to equalize three minutes later with a penalty. \nLewandowski claimed the winner with a header to Krzysztof Maczynski's cross in the 42nd. \nScotland routed Gibraltar 6-0 in Faro, Portugal, in the other group game to finish three points behind Ireland in fourth. Georgia finished six points further back, with Gibraltar bottom on none. \nGROUP F \nTwo first-half goals by Constantin Bulescu helped Romania secured its spot in France with a 3-0 away win over Faeroe Islands, while Greece beat Hungary 4-3 to avoid a winless qualifying campaign. \nAlready qualified Northern Ireland drew 1-1 with Finland in Helsinki after allowing a late equalizer by Paulus Arajuuri. Craig Cathcart had put the visitors ahead in the 31st. \nGreece finally ended its miserable run when substitute Panayiotis Kone headed in the winner in the 86th minute. \n''A bittersweet victory,'' said Greece coach Costas Tsanas, whose side finished bottom of the group, level on points with the Faeroe Islands. \nHungary led twice in the second half, only for Greece to equalize twice within three minutes. \nHungary finished third in the group, four points behind Romania, and will have another chance to reach the finals through the playoffs if it doesn't finish as the best third-placed team. \nGROUP I \nAlbania reached the European Championship for the first time thanks to its 3-0 victory in Armenia for second place in Group I. \nAlbania reached 14 points, two more than Denmark, which had already played its last qualifier and now faces the playoffs. \nGroup winner Portugal beat already eliminated Serbia 2-1, winning its seventh consecutive qualifier after a shock 1-0 loss to Albania in the teams' opener. Nani scored in the fifth minute, Zoran Tosic equalized in the 65th and substitute Joao Moutinho netted the winner in the 78th. \nPortugal finished with 21 points from eight matches. \nWith qualification already secured in advance, the Portuguese played without Cristiano Ronaldo and a few other regular starters. \nSerbia played the final minutes with nine men as captain Aleksandar Kolarov was sent off with a second yellow card in the 80th and Nemanja Matic received a straight red in the 81st. \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:37:14.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
