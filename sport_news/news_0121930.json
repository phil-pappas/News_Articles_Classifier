A smart, portable radar device that connects to a custom app on a smartphone allows young athletes worldwide to gather personal analytics, record videos and even get discovered by coaches and scouts.\nNEW YORK , Oct. 13, In the first phase, Scoutee is focusing on young baseball players and their coaches. The palm-sized radar device measures the speed of the ball and transfers data via Bluetooth to the user's smartphone, where players can determine other parameters of the pitch and record a video with pitch data overlaid. They can then easily share their results and videos with friends, coaches, or scouts. The company's goal is to provide baseball players and coaches all over the world with an accurate, reliable, easy to use and affordable tool for analytics and athletic recruitment. In order to achieve this, the Scoutee team put a lot of effort into providing excellent reliability and accuracy that is comparable to the best solutions on the market.\n1.5 billion players of other ball sports worldwide, such as soccer, cricket, tennis, golf, lacrosse, hockey and many others, will not have to wait long to get their own Scoutee tool since the company plans to release additional versions of the app in the very near future.\nThe Scoutee team has been working on Scoutee's development for the last year and is now in the last week of their Kickstarter campaign, raising funds for production of the first batch of devices.
