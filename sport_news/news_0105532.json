But Keylor Navas was outstanding in goal again, making a few very difficult saves, including a remarkable one on a close-range header in the first half.\nReal Madrid got the win despite playing with a depleted squad because of injuries. Coach Rafa Benitez was without defender Sergio Ramos, midfielder Luka Modric and striker Karim Benzema, who had scored six goals in as many league games this season.\nForward Gareth Bale, who was coming off an injury, was substituted at halftime.\nLevante has only six points from eight matches and could drop to last place in the 20-teaam standings depending on other results this weekend.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:18:25.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
