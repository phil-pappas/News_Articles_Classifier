His other award came with Manchester United in 2007-08 – while no other player has ever won four. \nThe 30-year-old also became Madrid’s all-time leading scorer on Sept. 30 with 324 goals, surpassing Raul Gonzalez’s previous mark. \n‘This is another great moment in my career. Receiving the fourth Golden Shoe is a great honour and a privilege,’ Ronaldo said after receiving the award. \n‘But without my team-mates, I would not be able to win individual awards. \n‘I always want to win more. I want five, six or seven Golden Shoes if possible. \n‘Real Madrid is the biggest club in the world and we always have to win titles.' \n‘I want the Champions League, La Liga and the Copa del Rey.’ \nReal Madrid president Florentino Perez hailed his star player for making history, while thanking him ‘on behalf of all Madridistas’ \n‘This award goes back to show that we have a unique and exceptional player in Cristiano Ronaldo,’ the Madrid president said. \n‘Cristiano Ronaldo is the only player in history to win the Golden Boot four times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:55:21.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
