They present a newer, sleeker way of engaging in fantasy games, one that removes the season-long commitment of standard leagues. Most importantly, they offer a platform with a huge amount of money behind it. \nThe setup for DFS sites is relatively straightforward. In the case of football, easily the most popular format for both regular and DFS fantasy, the basic guidelines are the same as season-long leagues. A given participant has a defined number of slots to fill — for DraftKings, the most popular DFS site, this includes one quarterback, two running backs, three wide receivers, one tight end, one FLEX (running back, wide receiver or tight end) and one team defense. \nHowever, unlike normal fantasy leagues, DFS operates on a weekly basis. Rather than players on your roster remaining so for the entirety of the season unless dropped or traded, each week on DFS is a brand new game. Each player in the system is assigned a value based on their expected production, and all participants in a given tournament have the same budget within which to fit their desired roster. Rather than just one manager in a league owning a given NFL player, everyone can own any player who fits into their budget regardless of overlap with other competitors — part of what allows for the huge tournaments these sites can run. Scoring varies between the different DFS sites, but is extremely similar to season-long leagues. \nAt the end of a given week comes the real allure of DFS: the payouts. Unlike standard fantasy games, which are run by large sites such as ESPN and Yahoo! and therefore barred from including a monetary element (many leagues organize these independently among members), DFS leagues are utilizing a few detailed mini-loopholes in online gaming laws to offer gigantic weekly prize pools. The winner of DraftKings' \"Millionaire Maker\" tournament, held each week with hundreds of thousands of entrants putting up $20 apiece, takes home an incredible $1.2 million just for setting the best lineup. \nThe biggest draw for DFS sites is their potential downfall as well, however. With the platform exploding this season and DFS ads flooding sporting television to a point of extreme saturation, the format has come under some fairly intense scrutiny in recent weeks. \nThe noise began near the end of September, when it was revealed that an employee of DraftKings, using certain vital information not available to non-DFS employees, won $350,000 in a tournament run by the largest competing site, FanDuel. This touched off a series of events — DraftKings and FanDuel both banned employees from playing on other sites for money, public outcry began about the ethical status of such sites and, most damningly, official inquiries began into the legality of the platforms. Thursday, the state of Nevada ruled that all fantasy games were a form of gambling. \nThis is all eventually heading in the same direction, of course. Fantasy sports and their connection to gambling have long been a topic of debate, one KSL has tackled in recent weeks as well. On an even broader scale, the question of whether sports gambling — an industry that could generate billions in tax revenue if regulated properly — should even remain illegal in the United States looms large. Many European countries with thriving sports leagues have allowed wagering on them for years, and while there are occasionally issues, they've mostly run smoothly. There's increasing noise from the legitimate side of sports in favor of legalizing sports betting, including from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver . \nWhatever your thoughts on these larger issues, DFS sites aren't going anywhere anytime soon. These sorts of legal inquiries can drag on, and even in the case of a firm decision, are often tough to enforce for an online-only business. \nAnd so long as they're around, expect DFS sites to continue to grow in popularity. A shot at such ridiculous money for a $20 entry is a massive draw, as is the one-week format that functions as a great outlet for the fantasy junkie who gets off to a bad start in a season-long league. The explosion has been similar to the online poker boom of the mid-2000s, one that forever changed the online gaming landscape across the globe. If the powers that be can keep things above board and operational, the seismic shift this time around could be even larger.
