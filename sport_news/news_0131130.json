(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nSeattle â€” Lions tight end Eric Ebron looked ready to continue his impressive start to the 2015 season, but a left knee injury forced him to exit in the first half of Monday night's game against the Seahawks at CenturyLink Field.\nOn a run by Theo Riddick in the second quarter, Lions center Travis Swanson rolled into the back of Ebron's knee. After trainers checked on him, Ebron gingerly walked off the field under his own power, but had to go to the locker room shortly thereafter. He did not return.\nBefore the injury, Ebron had two catches for 22 yards. He had at least four catches and 43 yards in each of the first three games so far in his second NFL season. His injury left the Lions with just one healthy tight end, Tim Wright.\nIn addition to Ebron leaving, Lions linebacker Travis Lewis exited with an apparent right knee injury after a punt near the end of the second quarter. He had a trainer help him walk off the field and to the locker room before the Seahawks kneeled for the final play of the first half. Lewis played well in the first half with four tackles, two for loss and a sack.\nLewis returned for the third quarter.\nLions defensive tackle Haloti Ngata suffered a right calf injury, and the team announced him as questionable to return early in the third quarter.\nAt the br\neak, the Lions trailed the Seahawks, 10-3.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:34:08.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
