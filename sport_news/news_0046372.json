John Reed / USA TODAY Sports FOX Sports   6:09p ET \nWith the latest allegations against Duke Williams , the surprise dismissal of Auburn 's most talented wide receiver certainly appears justified. Without getting into much specific detail, his teammates apparently agree with the decision. \n“Personally, I love him to death,” senior wide receiver Jonathan Wallace said, according to the Montgomery Advertiser . “I'm sad to see this had to take place but it needed to be done so we can move forward and get better as a team.” \nWith the Tigers having no game this week thanks to the bye, the offense will have more than a week to prepare for life without Williams. Auburn travels to Lexington Oct. 15 to face a rejuvenated Kentucky program eager to keep their winning season moving forward with another SEC win. \n“It’s kind of unfortunate it happened, but you got to draw the line somewhere,” Wallace said. “We move forward, everybody is handling it the right way.” \n“All teams are going to have people get in trouble and things happen on and off the field,” senior defensive back Jonathan Jones said. “It’s up to the team to come together and put that to the side and say, ‘hey, we’re going to focus on football.’ We’ve always been able to do that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:27:07.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
