(AP) â€” A second University of South Florida football player is now accused of firing a gun on campus.\nUniversity police arrested junior cornerback Lamar Robbins on Thursday afternoon. He remained in the Hillsborough County Jail early Friday with an $8,000 bond.\nPolice say they arrested Robbins after an investigation into the Oct. 11 arrest of freshman reserve offensive lineman Benjamin Knox. Arrest reports say Knox fired a gun at a dorm on the campus near Tampa.\nIn a statement released Friday, university police say they spoke with Robbins early in the investigation and he gave false information.\nEarlier this week, USF athletic department suspended Knox from team activities. They haven't made an announcement on Robbins' status.\nRobbins is charged with discharging a weapon on campus, a second-degree felony, and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.\nA lawyer for Robbins isn't listed on jail records.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
