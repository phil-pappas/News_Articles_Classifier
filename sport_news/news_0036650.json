Edwards talks Belichick and more with The Post’s Justin Terranova before Sunday’s AFC East showdown. \nQ: What is important for Todd Bowles in his first matchup against Belichick? \nA: You play to your strengths. When you start changing your identity and who you are, the players feel that and they are like, “Coach, we’ve done this to get to 4-1, why are we changing? We’re pretty good at what we do.” New England’s game plan is pretty consistent, so Todd will have a plan early in the game and then they’ll probe you try and figure out what you are going to do, how you are going to adjust.\nQ: What makes Belichick difficult to coach against? \nA: You have to be able to adjust. Offensively, they are always trying to look at ways to spread you out and find the weaker spots of your defense and attack it whether it’s running the football, going no-huddle. Against Buffalo, he wouldn’t give them time to rotate guys out and he tired them out. So, there’s always going to be an attack. Todd has been coaching a long time and knows what he wants to do there.\nQ: Are you surprised at Bowles’ early success? \nA: He was given a really outstanding front seven and they did a great job of acquiring secondary guys with [Darrelle] Revis, [Antonio] Cromartie, [Marcus] Gilchrist and the rest of them. You knew these guys were going to be an outstanding defense, it was just a matter of how fast they can gel. And they seemed to do that very quickly, so that’s good coaching on his part. They are a very confident group.\nQ: What are the Patriots’ weaknesses? \nA: When Tom Brady is pressured inside and you stay in your lanes, that gives him problems. Now, they have to get the ball out quickly, if they don’t then their tackles can’t hold up. That’s the problem when you’re spread out, you can get to him quickly off the edge. You can’t allow him to step up in the pocket — that’s where he does most of his work. They do a great job of crossing routes and a lot of rubs and picks if you play man-to-man. Todd has to be alert about that, all of a sudden someone gets picked off and it’s a big play.\nQ: What would it mean for the Jets’ confidence to win this game? \nA: If you are going to win the division it goes through New England, and everyone knows that. If you beat them up there, that’s saying a lot. They’ve won the division 12 out of 14 years … it doesn’t take a math major to figure it out.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bill belichick ,  new england patriots ,  new york jets ,  todd bowles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:14:39.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
