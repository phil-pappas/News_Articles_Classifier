Khan had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 6 lakh from a builder. Kejriwal also recommended a CBI probe into the case.\nImmediately, #AAPWalksTheTalk began to trend on Twitter, as users expressed delight that AAP had been true to its word of rooting out corruption. However, there were some critical and mocking responses as well:\nSuri Singh made a pertinent point:\nIf ministers are sacked even before the expose with such speed, Arnab would soon be out of job. 15 episodes washed out :) #AAPWalksTheTalk\n— Suri Singh (@Suri_Sing) October 9, 2015\nWhile Rupin was full of praise, she admits she doesn't understand politics:\nDon't understand much of politics but I've never heard of something like this.

However, it seems that the Twitter timeline is full of AAP supporters who have held up this decision from Kejriwal as an example of AAP's honesty.
