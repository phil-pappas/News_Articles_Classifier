Pleasant News \nDANVILLE — The New London football team played the role of spoiler on Friday night in Danville. The Bears hosted the Tigers for homecoming and had visions of a big win, but New London stormed back from an 18-8 deficit to shock the home crowd with two third quarter touchdowns, and pulled off a 24-18 win. \nAustin McBeth was a workhorse once again for New London, this time to the tune of 29 carries and five receptions. The Tiger senior opened up the scoring early in the first quarter with a five-yard touchdown run, and a Tyler Stephenson two-point conversion made it 8-0. \nDanville struck back with two scores of their own. The Bears tied the game in the first quarter with a 45-yard strike from Bryce Carr to Kole Perkins, and tied it up with a two-point conversion. Then, in the second quarter, Bryton Rice caught a 14-yard touchdown pass, and an extra point made it 15-8. \nA Danville field goal in the first quarter bumped the Bears’ lead to 18-8, but those were the last points the Bears would score all night. New London, however, re-found their offense later in the quarter. \nThe Tigers cut the lead to 18-15 when quarterback Blake Nehring hit McBeth for a 20-yard touchdown pass, and Tyler Mettler caught a pass for the two-point conversion. Then, later in the quarter, McBeth finished a drive with a two-yard touchdown run and Mettler caught another two-point pass to make it 24-18 New London. \nThe New London defense stayed true through the rest of the half, and the Tigers won their first district game of the season. They now sit at 2-3 overall and 1-2 in conference. The win was New London’s first road win since Sept. 5 of last year. \nMcBeth finished the game with 196 yards rushing and two touchdowns. He also caught five passes for 53 yards and one score. Dallas Bell had two rushing attempts on the day for 37 yards on the ground. \nNehring’s final line was 11-13 for 161 yards and one touchdown. Reno Chiri went 4-8 with 13 yards. Stevenson led the tiger receivers with six catches for 72 yards. Jayden Flowers caught two passes for 43 yards. \nMcBeth also led the team defensively, with nine tackles including three tackles for a loss. Cole Helmerson and Stevenson each had seven tackles, Keontae Luckett had 6.5 apiece, and Jordan Riley had four. \nThe Tigers will return home to host undefeated Winfield-Mt. Union on Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:31:31.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
