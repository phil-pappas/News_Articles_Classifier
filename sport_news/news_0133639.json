There were multiple dropped passes on offense and dropped interceptions on defense. The Patriots couldn’t stop the New York Jets on third down. Ryan Fitzpatrick picked apart the Patriots’ secondary. The Jets controlled the tempo throughout the game. The Patriots ran into the perfect storm on Sunday. For a team that prides itself on execution and playing a full 60 minutes, they were victimized by their own mistakes and a Jets team that proved to be a worthy AFC East adversary. But they’re not ready to wear the crown just yet. Despite it all, the Patriots still found a way to win on Sunday, pulling out a 30-23 victory at Gillette Stadium. They improved to 6-0 for the third time in franchise history. “They came out and we knew it was going to be a dogfight,” Julian Edelman said. “It was.” The Patriots found themselves in unfamiliar territory on Sunday, trailing in the fourth quarter for the first time this season, 20-16. Up until that point, the Pats offense had been stalling against the top-ranked Jets defensive unit. But when Tom Brady (34-for-54 for 355 yards and two touchdowns) and his teammates took the field with 12:50 remaining in the game, things started to change. Utilizing an attack that consisted almost entirely of pass plays, the Patriots moved down the field twice for scores by Danny Amendola (eight receptions for 86 yards) and Rob Gronkowski (11 catches for 108 yards). “We just stuck together,” Gronkowski said. “Obviously throughout the game our offense wasn’t clicking the whole time, which we need to be. We can’t be having so many three-and-outs. In the fourth quarter, we just dig down. Dig deep. Players were stepping up, making plays. Tom was on point. I thought the line was doing a great job. We just executed as an offense, as a unit.” The Patriots reclaimed the lead with a 10-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a great catch by Amendola with 7:16 left. At the 8-yard line, on third down, Brady hit an airborne Amendola for the score to make it 23-20. “I’m really proud of our team again today,” coach Bill Belichick said. “It definitely wasn’t our best performance — a lot of things that we left out on the field, just didn’t do well enough, but in the end we were able to make the plays we needed to make when we needed to make them.” The defense forced the Jets into a three-and-out on the next drive to give the offense back the ball with 5:32 remaining. New England rolled down the field once again, with Brady this time hitting a wide-open Gronkowski for a 15-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 30-20 lead with 1:13 left. “You can’t panic. You can’t worry. You just got to stick to the script,” Gronkowski said. “Stay level-headed and when it’s our turn on offense, we’ve got to go out there and execute. They have a good team. We had to keep fighting. We had to play 60 minutes.” The Patriots needed every ounce of effort on this day. Offensively, the Patriots struggled out of the gate — even with good field position. Chandler Jones strip-sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick on the second play of the game and Dont’a Hightower recovered the fumble to give the Pats the ball at the 19-yard line. The offense couldn’t do much and settled for a 38-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski to take an early 3-0 lead. It went downhill after that. The Patriots' second drive ended with a dropped pass by James White, and the team ended up punting. The third drive was a three-and-out featuring a drop from Brandon LaFell. In total, the team had nine drops (six from LaFell). While that was going on, the Patriots had early troubles on defense. The Jets converted five of their six third-down plays to start the game. The Jets tied the game on their second drive thanks to a 20-yard field goal by Nick Folk. They got in the end zone on their next drive to open up the second quarter with a 10-3 lead. Missed sacks by the Patriots turned into long gains on that drive and Jeremy Kerley topped it off with a five-yard touchdown reception. The Patriots defense settled down after that, holding the Jets to consecutive three-and-outs. Offensively, things started to slowly get better. The Patriots started their fourth offensive possession at the Jets' 47-yard line and got all the way to the goal line. After New England failed to score on three straight plays, Brady leaped over the pile on fourth-and-goal from the 1 to tie the game, 10-10, with 6:24 left in the first half. The Pats took the lead back on their next possession, getting a 46-yard field goal from Gostkowski with two minutes remaining in the first half. They opened up the second half with another field goal after Edelman dropped a pass in the end zone. That 16-10 lead didn’t last long as the Jets roared back to life, converting three third-down plays. The drive ended with a nine-yard touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick to a wide-open Chris Ivory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:54:25.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
