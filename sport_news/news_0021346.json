That's all it takes. There's no other way. We can't read into this result anymore. It's over — disappointing as it was. We got to move forward.\" \nOlympic qualifying is limited to under-23 teams, and the Americans were eliminated four years ago in the group stage. Senior national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann said failing to reach the London Olympics set back the careers of players in that age group, which included Brek Shea, Mix Diskerud and Bill Hamid.

Among the American starters were New York Red Bulls defender Matt Miazga, Tottenham under-21 defender Cameron Carter-Vickers, Fulham midfielder Emerson Hyndman, Real Salt Lake midfielder Luis Gil and Stanford forward Jordan Morris, who already has scored for the U.S. senior national team. \n\"We were not able to deal with the situation today,\" U.S. coach Andi Herzog said. \"It's sad, but it's the truth.\" \nHerzog cannot be on the bench for Tuesday's game after receiving a red card in the 81st minute from referee Jafeth Perea of Panama, who also gave a red to Honduras coach Carlos Tabora.

The best chance was in the 63rd, minute, when goalkeeper Luis Lopez made a diving one-handed deflection on Carter-Vickers' header off a corner kick. \nElis doubled the lead when he flicked the ball inside the far post following Kevin Lopez's cross.

Can't fault them for that.\" United States coach Andreas Herzog, right, shouts at a official while Honduras head coach Carlos Tabora, left, points during the second half of a CONCACAF men's Olympics semifinal qualifying soccer match, Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, in Sandy, Utah.
