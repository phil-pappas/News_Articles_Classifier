Most of the names released Wednesday were not new: the FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, and the head of European soccer’s governing body, Michel Platini, had already been provisionally banned by FIFA as it looks into what has been described as a “disloyal payment” by Mr. Blatter to Mr. Platini. But ethics committee investigators also confirmed that they had advanced cases related to Franz Beckenbauer, the former German star who once served on FIFA’s governing executive committee, and Angel Villar Llona of Spain, the FIFA senior vice president who is temporarily running Europe’s governing body, UEFA, while Mr. Platini is suspended. And the committee noted that its probe of Jérôme Valcke was related to “the suspicion of misuse of expenses and other infringements.” Mr. Valcke, FIFA’s top administrator and Mr. Blatter’s top deputy, was relieved of his duties last month amid charges that he had profited from a black-market ticketing scheme. The other names released Wednesday amount to a who’s who of past FIFA scandals: Jeffrey Webb, the former Concacaf president who was arrested at a Zurich hotel in May ; Eugenio Figueredo and Nicolás Leoz, who were included in the United States indictments in May; Ricardo Teixeira, the former Brazilian soccer chief who quit FIFA in 2012 to head off an earlier corruption probe; Amos Adamu, a Nigerian once banned for soliciting a bribe for his vote in the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups; and Worawi Makudi, the Thai soccer official and former ExCo member who was provisionally suspended earlier this week . The ethics committee was given new rights to discuss its activities by FIFA’s executive committee on Tuesday. Previously, it was barred from even confirming the existence of an investigation before a final ruling was announced.
