At 25-years-old, the 6-11, 270 pound big man is known for bruising opposing defenders with his power and tenacity in the paint.\nStatistically among the NBA's centers, he ranked first in scoring (24.1 points per game), third in rebounding (12.7 rpg), and tied for second in overall games with a double double last season (47).\nImpressive? Without a doubt. But does he have what it takes to be crowned NBA MVP?\nDeMarcus Cousins Points, Rebounds, and Assists | PointAfter\nHistory says no.\nTo win an MVP, your team must be at least a top-three seed heading into the playoffs.\nIn fact, the last time that a player was awarded MVP on a team lower than a third seed was the late, great Moses Malone in 1982 (sixth seeded Houston Rockets) -- the same year that Michael Jackson released Thriller, just to give you an idea of how long ago that was.\nMalone also averaged 31.1 points and 14.7 rebounds that year.\nSince then, there hasn't been an MVP award winner from a team with fewer than 50 wins (excluding lockouts).\nThe Kings haven't had a 30-win season since 2008 and, although they had an impressive offseason, won't be anywhere near the top of the Western Conference come playoff time.\nSo to put it simply -- the MVP award isn't for Cousins to grab.\nInstead, guys like Steph Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant and LeBron James will be looking to lead their teams to a top-spot in their conferences, likely earning MVP honors in the process.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://w.graphiq.com/w/a0DNZ8DEcFn", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://basketball-players.pointafter.com/l/65/DeMarcus-Cousins", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:28:14.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
