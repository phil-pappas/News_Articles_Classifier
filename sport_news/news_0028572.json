The executive session, which is closed to the public, is slated for 6 p.m. at City Hall, 1655 First St. The Council’s regular meeting will start at 7 p.m. Oregon’s public records law allows city councils to discuss certain issues in executive session. The exemption that is listed on the agenda for Tuesday’s meeting is to consult with legal counsel. The public records law forbids councils from making any decision during an executive session. Although the agenda cites only the applicable section of the public records law, and doesn’t mention the precise topic of the discussion with legal counsel, Councilor Richard Langrell, in an email he sent to Mayor Kim Mosier on Saturday, asks why the “annexation contracts and ordinances regarding sewer/water rates were not in the council packets” mailed to councilors on Friday. Langrell asked that the city email that information to councilors “so that we will all have time to review them before the executive session.” The discussion planned during Tuesday’s executive session came about because of the lawsuit Langrell and his wife, Lynne, filed against the city in 2014. The couple contended that the city had overcharged them for water and sewer fees for their motel for several years. Although city officials had discussed those higher fees with the Langrells, in exchange for the couple not paying city property taxes for 10 years after their property was annexed into the city in 2005, the annexation contract the Langrells signed that year did not state that the couple would pay the higher water and sewer fees. This spring a judge ruled in the Langrells’ favor and ordered the city to pay the couple $50,000. The city also spent about $17,300 in attorney’s fees on the case. Last month Langrell suggested that other landowners whose property was also annexed into the city might be due refunds. City Manager Mike Kee said one annexation contract, for property near the Langrells,’ also lacked a clause requiring higher water and sewer fees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:13:51.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
