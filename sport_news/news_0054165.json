Whisenhunt: Marcus Mariota will not play Sunday against the Falcons. \n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) October 23, 2015 \nMariota suffered a sprained MCL last Sunday against the Miami Dolphins when he was hit on the left knee by defensive end Olivier Vernon, a play Whisenhunt described as “bleeping bullbleep” (quote edited for sensitive ears) and one that drew a $17,363 fine for Vernon from the NFL. Mariota remained in the game with a brace, but has missed practice all week. \nMariota, last year’s Heisman Trophy winner, has completed 64.1 percent of his passes for 1,020 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions in what has been a fairly good rookie season. \nZach Mettenberger, who is 0-6 lifetime as an NFL starter, will take Mariota’s place against the Falcons. After spending the first 17 years of his Post career writing and editing, Matt and the printed paper had an amicable divorce in 2014.
