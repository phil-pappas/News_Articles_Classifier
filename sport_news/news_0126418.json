(AP Photo/Jay LaPrete) Sponsored Links By The Associated Press The Associated Press \nNo. 1 Ohio State will start quarterback J.T. Barrett in Saturday's game against Rutgers, replacing Cardale Jones. \nCoach Urban Meyer made the announcement Tuesday. \nBarrett lost the starting job to Jones following a closely watched quarterback battle in the offseason for the defending national champions. But Jones has struggled to find the form that helped him lead the Buckeyes to the national title last season. \nJones has just seven touchdowns against five picks this season. He threw for just 84 yards in last week's win over Penn State. \nBarrett has come on in recent weeks, with seven total touchdowns in the last two games. \nMeyer says red zone and third-down production were the main reasons for the switch.
