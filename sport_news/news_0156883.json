OVERALL \nThe tournament, switched from Centennial Valley to Conway Country Club because of greens being replaced at Centennial Valley, drew compliments from almost everyone from the way it was run and how Conway High officials, headed by CHS coach Janet Taylor, and a host of volunteers. \nThe officials at Conway Country Club made sure it ran smoothly and the golfers ended up putting on some of the best-kept greens in central Arkansas. \nWhen it hosts any kind of event, Conway High can always depend on outstanding community support and volunteers. DRAMATICS \nThe finish, in which Rogers’ Brooke Matthews defeated Conway’s Casey Ott for the individual title with a birdie on the final hole, was described by veteran observers as one of the best individual matchups ever in state high school golf. THREE NOT FOUR \nFort Smith Southside, with three golfers posting steady rounds, easily won by 13 strokes over second-place Conway. \nTeams are allowed to play up to five golfers but only the three best scores count. \nThe interesting part is if the top four scores were allowed, Conway would have won the state title. The Cats’ best five were better than Southside’s best five. But Southside had the best three. \nFor example, if Conway’s fourth-best score were counted (Logan Tolliver and Sydney Stiener both had 179s over two rounds), it would \nhave bested Southside’s best fourth score of 193 and Conway would have won by one stroke. WHERE ARE THE PLAYERS? \nSpringdale, North Little Rock and Bryant are among the largest high schools in the state. Yet, among them, they sent only a total of five players to the state championship. \nSpringdale did not even send a tteam. North Little Rock had three golfers, including third-place finisher Hannah Bakalekos. Bryant sent only two and did not qualify for team competitiion. A GAP \nThere is a wide gap between the very good girls golfers in the state and the rest. It showed with the scores at Conway Country Club, a tight, tricky course that demands placement. \nThe top three golfers (Ott, Matthews and Bakalekos fired in the low 70s as did Bentonville’s Kate Robertson, who followed a first-round 82 with a 72. \nSeveral golfers were in the 80s each day. \nAfter that, it went from the low 90s way up. \nThere were 42 individual rounds of 100 or more on the par-72 course, ranging from 103 to 153. There were eight rounds over 130 (or at least 58-over par).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:15:22.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
