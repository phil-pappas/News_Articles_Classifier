As one of many ranked teams that the Hokies have played this year, the Cavaliers proved to be a tough challenge. \nVirginia Tech historically has not played well against Virginia. Out of the 35 matchups these two teams have had, Virginia Tech has won only twice, in 2004 and 2005. The Hokies tied the Cavaliers three times. \nThe Hokies were looking for a victory Friday night, not only to finish strong on the season in hopes of winning the ACC tournament but also to bounce back from Tuesday night’s 5-0 loss to Charlotte. Leading up to Friday’s game, Virginia Tech was 1-2-2 against ranked teams this season and was eager to knock off its rival and ranked opponent. \nTech also looked to defeat its rival on television, where the game could be seen on ESPN3. \nDespite the delayed game because U.Va. was stuck in traffic, the rivalry was still noticeably fiery in the first few minutes of action. Physical play dominated the first 10 minutes of the match as Virginia Tech maintained most of the possessions. \nThe Cavaliers took control of the scoreboard in the 12th minute with a goal from Derrick Etienne. They consistently pressured the Hokies' defense throughout the remainder of the half. Despite the constant pressure, Virginia Tech managed to crank out eight shots compared to U.Va.’s one. \nAs the second half commenced, the Hokies and Cavaliers pressed on. Neither team could gain the advantage, and possession was shared equally between the two. As the half continued, both sides began to wear on each other and still the scored stood at 1-0. \nU.Va. added another five shots. Tech pursued and shot another four times but had no luck putting the ball in. One notable attempt was when Daniel Lauretano hit the post off a handball. \nIn the end Virginia Tech could not rally and come back against U.Va. \nAlthough Tech could not get the win, the team did play very well. U.Va. is one of many top-ranked opponents the Hokies have faced this year, and losing 1-0 to a ranked team is no easy task. \nTech’s season is quickly coming to an end with only two games left. There is one last home game against Belmont on Oct. 27 and a road trip down to North Carolina to play Duke on Oct. 30. \nIf the Hokies win their next two games, they will be ready for the much-anticipated ACC tournament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:23:16.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
