He acknowledged his lack of experience at international level, but expressed confidence in his ability. \n\"Opportunities come along and I know people will question me, more as a selector than as a coach. But I hope to get it right because this is a great opportunity and I hope to give everything to meet expectations,\" the 53-year-old told reporters. \nOsorio will make his debut next month when Mexico hosts El Salvador and travels to Honduras in qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. \nHe is the first Colombian to lead the Mexican national squad. \nFerretti was in charge for four matches including Saturday’s extra-time victory over the U.S., which secured Mexico’s place at the 2017 Confederations Cup. \nArgentine Ricardo La Volpe was the last to complete a four-year cycle with Mexico, leading the team to the knockout stage at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. \nSince then, Mexico has had a revolving door of coaches who often were criticized for underwhelming results: Hugo Sanchez, Jesus Ramirez, Sven-Goran Eriksson, Javier Aguirre, Enrique Meza, Efrain Flores, Jose Manuel De la Torre, Luis Fernando Tena, Victor Manuel Vucetich, Herrera and Ferretti. \nOsorio coached Mexican club Puebla for 11 matches in the 2012 season, losing seven of those before being dismissed. That record has led to criticism of Mexico’s latest hire by some who came before him. \nAfter leaving Mexico, Osorio led Colombian club Atletico Nacional to three league and two cup titles before moving to Sao Paulo. \nMourinho fined \nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been fined $77,000 and suspended one game for accusing referees of being biased against his team. \nSpeaking after a 3-1 loss to Southampton on Oct. 3, Mourinho said referees \"are afraid to give decisions for Chelsea.\" \nEngland’s soccer association said that Mourinho’s remarks \"constituted improper conduct\" as they implied bias and brought the game into disrepute. \n— The Associated Press  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:51:38.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
