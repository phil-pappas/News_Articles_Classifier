Tweet \nSecond-placed Saddlers welcome Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s side to the Banks’s for a fixture that could see Walsall leapfrog the Brewers at the top of League One. \nIt’s been an eventful few weeks for both sides with Dean Smith and Hasselbaink attracting interest from Rotherham, after the Millers decided to part ways with boss Steve Evans. \nBut Chambers insists speculation won’t affect the players when they take to the pitch tomorrow. \nHe said: “There is always going to be speculation around managers who do well. \n“Chairmen at clubs are going to take notice, because both men have a good philosophy and have done well without spending large sums of money. \n“But it hasn’t affected us at all, we have just carried on doing exactly as we would have. \n“Everyone’s focus has solely been on the Burton game. As a group we are very confident we can achieve big things this season. \n“So everyone is just concentrating on maintaining our good form and winning three points.” \nAfter being crowned League Two champions back in May, Burton have adapted quickly to life in the third tier. Yet their success has not come as a surprise to Chambers. \nHe said: “Confidence is such a big factor in football. Sometimes teams that come up have that momentum. They have won a lot of games and they will come here expecting to win.
