Also, many players move on to (NCAA) Division I schools from Wabash, so I'm excited about the possibilities. \n\"Wabash is going to be the best fit for me as I move on after high school.\" \nShuler earned a spot on the 2015 M-I All-Area Team after batting .383 with 11 doubles, three triples, three home runs and 35 RBIs, despite a slightly torn labrum in his left shoulder. \n\"I was able to battle through that,\" Shuler said, \"and I'm fine now. I feel real strong.\" \nThis past summer, Shuler — who bats left and throws right — was starting catcher on the Rockport American Legion baseball team that won the Indiana state championship. \nShuler's breakthrough season at Apollo came his sophomore year, when hit .424 with five home runs and 28 RBIs. \nNow, he will be focused on a strong finish to what has already been a highly distinguished high school career. \n\"I'm glad I've made the commitment because that's going to take a little bit of pressure off and I'm looking forward to just focusing on my senior season,\" Shuler said. \"I just want to go out and play hard everyday, do my best to help us be the best team we can be this spring.\" \nShuler credits longtime Apollo coach Bob Mantooth for much of his development at the plate, and behind it. \n\"Coach Mantooth is one of the best coaches around,\" Shuler said. \"He definitely helped me come into my own, as both a player and a person. He had a lot of faith in me when I was younger, believed I could be a quality high school catcher and hitter, and that meant a lot coming from him. \n\"Now, as a I move forward, I want to take what I've learned and become the best baseball player I can become over the next several years.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:21:52.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
