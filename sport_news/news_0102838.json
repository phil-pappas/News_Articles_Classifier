He was also absent for 3-on-3 OT -- during which his speed and skill set generally separates him from the rest -- and the shootout.\nBobby Ryan was the only Senator who scored in the four-round tie-breaking format lost by Ottawa.\n\"He's getting looked at,\" Cameron said of Hoffman, who missed Friday's practice. \"There's no definite decision on whether he's going to be able to play (Saturday) night or not. It's the famous 'day-to-day.'\n\"Is it long term? I don't think so now. But I haven't talked to (head athletic therapist) Gerry (Townend) today. So I don't want to say what it is or isn't. I don't know. It'll be day-to-day as far as I know.\"\nCameron doesn't recall the incident that forced Hoffman to leave the game.\n\"In a case like this, when something like that happens, and you're on the bench as a coach, you look back (and think) was there any big collision or anything?,\" said Cameron. \"And I don't remember anything, so I don't know if it's wear and tear or what.\"\nIf Hoffman is unable to play, McCormick is likely to play on the fourth line with Zack Smith and Chris Neil.\nScheduled to fill in for Hoffman on the top line with ex-Coyote Kyle Turris and Mark Stone, if necessary, is Curtis Lazar, although Cameron said other players could also get a look \"depending on how it goes.\" He added that Lazar would get the first opportunity because of his strong play with the puck, an aspect of the game Hoffman has greatly improved.\nThe Hoffman-Turris-Stone line has not only been the most productive in the NHL to date, but it represents Ottawa's only consistent threat. Each player has eight points, which combined represents more than a third of the 61 accumulated by the team.\n\"I'm familiar playing with Turrey and Stoney, we had a couple of games last year and I feel we work pretty good together,\" said Lazar, who has scored one goal this season - an empty netter - while being stonewalled on a number of quality opportunities. \"There's no point in getting frustrated so far. I'm getting the chances right now. I feel a lot more comfortable with my game. I think you see that with my ice time being increased a little bit, here and there. Keep on plugging away.\n\"When the puck goes in, it's going to be going in quite often for myself. It's just a matter of time.\"\nWhile Marc Methot declared himself ready to return from a concussion that kept him out of the lineup for two games, Cameron said the veteran defenceman still has to go through one more protocol before getting the green light.\n\"I feel really good on the ice in practice and that's usually the best way to give yourself a good solid baseline,\" said Methot. \"I've had no issues. I feel back to normal.\"\nMethot said he has never before experienced \"head issues\" in his career.\n\"I got bumped pretty good (last week) in the Columbus game, then again in the Pittsburgh game,\" he said. \"Really when I started noticing some symptoms was the following day, after the back to back games.\n\"I felt a little nauseous in the morning, maybe a little dizzy too. I guess after doing a few tests we came to that conclusion, that it was a mild concussion.\nHe added that he appreciates the precautions taken by the Senators in dealing with the injury.\n\"The team has done a great job of going through the protocol, and making sure I was a little patient and not rushing back in to play, because you don't want to set yourself behind and miss that many more games, just because of being a little impatient,\" said Methot. \"So I think we handled it the right way, and I look forward to getting back whenever they decide to throw me in.\"\nCameron said he will make a decision on which of the seven defenceman to sit if Methot can play. It's not necessarily a no-brainer, as he has liked Chris Wideman's two games as a fill-in.\nCameron had a long conversation with Patrick Wiercioch near the end of practice.\nSens' winger Mike Hoffman not expected to be out of lineup long\nBy Don Brennan , Ottawa Sun First posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 02:11 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 23, 2015 09:14 PM EDT\nIt appears the Senators have dodged a bullet with the “lower body” injury that took first line left winger Mike Hoffman out of Thursday’s game late in the third period.\nAs far as coach Dave Cameron knows, it will not keep him out of the lineup for an extended period of time.\nHowever, whether Hoffman plays Saturday, when the Senators host the Arizona Coyotes, remains undetermined.\n“He’s getting looked at,” Cameron said Friday after a practice which did not include Hoffman. “There’s no definite decision on whether he’s going to be able to play (Saturday) night or yet. It’s the famous ‘day-to-day.’\n“Is it long term? I don’t think so now. But I haven’t talked to (head athletic therapist) Gerry (Townend) today. So I don’t want to say what it is or isn’t. I don’t know.
