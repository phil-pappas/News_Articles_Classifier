Family members say his initial symptoms fit the signs of dehydration. \n“They asked him if he had a headache and he said he had a headache that was nine out of ten,” Josh’s sister Rachel Dick said. \nRachel said Josh underwent surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. \n“To kill the rest of it, they did chemo. They started out doing chemo and radiation and the James. From there his chemo got more intense and he had his most intense chemo just this last summer,” she said. \nRachel says Josh kept a smile during his fight against cancer and continued to do well in school. \n“He was always super positive and played games when he had his chemo treatments. He would even bring homework,” she said. \nJosh gave cancer the same energy in the hospital as he gave soccer on the field. His goal this time lifted more than his team’s score. \n“He would call other people and make their day better even though all the stuff he was going through,” Rachel said. \nSchool officials hung a large number 7 with Josh’s name on it, on the fence surrounding the field. Many people cried as the Dick family unveiled the memorial. \n“I hope it's something that's actually going to make a change and when people look at it, they think of the fight that he had and the faith that he had,” Rachel said. ©2015 by 10TV.com.
