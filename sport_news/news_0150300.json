The banks who have cut rates so far include SBI, PNB, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Andhra Bank, IDBI Bank, Axis Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce. “Kotak Mahindra Bank has reduced its base rate from the current level of 9.75% to 9.50% with effect from October 5, 2015,” the bank said in a filing to the BSE. All categories of loans (other than the exceptions permitted by the RBI) will be priced with reference to the revised base rate, it added.
