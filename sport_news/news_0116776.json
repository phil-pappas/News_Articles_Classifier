Delph shines but Frankton can't topple Speedway By Jake Fox | For The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin \nFRANKTON -- For Frankton running back Isaiah Delph, the end of a stellar senior season and career hasn’t set in yet. \nDelph ran 40 times for 348 yards and four touchdowns in his final game, but a big second quarter led the Speedway Sparkplugs to a 49-38 road victory over Frankton in the first round of sectionals Friday. \nThe Eagles’ season ends at 4-6, but Delph was happy with his team’s effort. \n“I think it was good (effort),” he said. “Everybody played at 100 percent.” \nFrankton came out ready to play, looking to prove it belonged in a sectional loaded with talent. \nThe Eagles controlled the first quarter and were first on the board as Delph’s 15-yard run made it 6-0. The lead would stand up until the end of the first quarter. \nDelph gave the crowd life with an 82-yard scamper to start the second quarter, and a two-point conversion made it 14-0 in favor of the home team. With his big performance, the 5-foot-9 back finished the season with more than 1,600 rushing yards. \n“Isaiah is a workhorse. He’s such a great kid,” Frankton coach Randy England said. “Hard-worker, runs hard. He never gave up, he’s getting hit three, four, five times, bouncing off, spinning … That’s going to be a kid that’s hard to replace.” \nThe momentum that Frankton had in the first quarter and change shifted to the other sideline in a matter of two plays. \nAfter a 37-yard touchdown pass from Speedway quarterback Chris Valentine to Sam Jackson, Frankton fumbled on the ensuing kickoff leading to another Sparkplugs touchdown and a tied game. Speedway took a 21-14 lead into the locker room. \nThe Eagles responded with a touchdown to start the third quarter, but couldn’t regain control. Speedway scored to make it 28-20, then Frankton turned it over on downs two straight possessions deep in enemy territory. \n“We had a couple plays that we’d like to have back that were costly,” England said. “Not punching it in from the one (yard line) was a big defensive stand for them and it’s something we can look back on and go ‘We should’ve put that in.’” \nFrom there, the Sparkplugs rode their junior tailback Jacob Jones, who had a big game with four touchdowns as well. \nFrankton quarterback Travis McGuire threw two fourth-quarter touchdowns, but it wasn’t enough to rally for a win. McGuire finished 10-of-16 for 159 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. \nThe Eagles outgained the Sparkplugs 587-525 in the high-scoring affair. Speedway worked with shorter field, however, due to multiple onside-like kickoffs. \nDespite the loss, England was proud of the Eagles’ growth this season. He said his team played their hearts out in its final contest of the 2015 season. \n“We battled. We could’ve quit many of times when they came back on us, and we battled back,” England said. “I’m proud to death of these kids. They never gave up.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:17:13.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
