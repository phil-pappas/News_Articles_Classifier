The win was Passaic's first since a 22-21 victory over Bergen Tech in October 2013. \n\"You keep talking about if you push and persevere and keep working that good things are going to happen,\" Mantz said. \"When good things weren't happening week after week, it was getting frustrating. But for those kids who hung in there, you could just see the relief in the kids' faces. It was very, very gratifying. The kids were pumped.\" \nSophomore tailback Deondre Tosen rushed for 257 yards and four scores on 20 carries against NV/Demarest. Senior quarterback Tyshawn Bunting, the leader of Passaic's unique single-wing offense, rushed 26 times for 238 yards and three touchdowns. \nMantz credited an offensive line led by senior tackle Genaro Delgado Jr., senior guard Javier Ogando and junior center John Chris Rodriguez for creating plenty of running room for Tosen and Bunting. \nSenior defensive lineman Kelvin Leal paced Passaic's defense with six tackles, two of which went for losses. The Indians (1-5), who trailed 21-20 at the half, also recovered a pair of onside kicks in the second half and converted them into touchdowns. \n\"To get that win, I think they're all going to be back in school [today] with their chests pumped up and feeling a lot better about everything,\" said Mantz, whose team went 0-10 last season. \"I really think it's going to do a lot for the kids. They're realizing something positive is happening.\" \nPassaic will try to begin a winning streak Friday night, when it hosts Fair Lawn (1-6) at Boverini Stadium. \n\"We're hoping to get some momentum going,\" Mantz said. \"We take one game at a time, but we'd like to put two [wins] together.\" \nEmail: idec@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:44:41.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
