Scott G Winterton, Summary \nKrystkowiak, Taylor express confidence that Utah can continue its success with others stepping up. “ There’s not going to be a guy that does what Delon did. We’re going to have a different identity.” Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak \nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah isn’t necessarily searching for the next Delon Wright. The All-American, who helped guide the Utes to a 26-9 record and the Sweet 16 last season, has moved on to the NBA’s Toronto Raptors. \nUtah coach Larry Krystkowiak acknowledged the Utes had two great years with Wright, but noted that it’s time for this season’s guys to step up. \n“There’s not going to be a guy that does what Delon did,” said Krystkowiak, who added that each campaign has a different cast of characters. “We’re going to have a different identity. Collectively you hope that everybody’s willing to pitch in a few more percent, or a few more of this and that — assists, steals, whatever is coming up.” \nAs such, Krystkowiak insists “there’s no heat on anybody to try to fill that void” left by Wright’s departure. \nSenior guard Brandon Taylor has similar thoughts. He noted that this year’s squad brings different things to the table and felt that all the players stepped up last year. \n“Delon was obviously a big part of us,” Taylor said. “But we’ll survive.” \nTaylor explained that the Utes will have a different identity and that the team is deeper and more talented than last season. He said they’ll be better overall and more mature in mindset. \n“At the end of the day we know what it takes to get to the tournament,” Taylor continued. “A great group of guys got to the tournament last year and we fought. We fought all the way to the Sweet 16.” \nBy doing so, he said, the experience should be beneficial. \nSO FAR, SO GOOD: Wednesday’s practice was Utah’s fifth in the new Huntsman Basketball Facility. Although Krystkowiak said some boxes are still being unpacked and things are getting sorted out, the place is drawing rave reviews. \n“It’s a heckuva place for everybody, you know,” Krystkowiak said. “It’s an incredible improvement for all of us — coaches and players — and there seems to be a lot of pride in the building right now.” \nTaylor took it a step further. \n“It’s amazing. I don’t ever leave, to be quite honest. I really don’t ever leave,” he said. “When I’m practicing, I’m either shooting free throws, or shooting, or even chilling in the players’ lounge. It’s quite nice to have.” \nREADY TO PICK: As of Wednesday afternoon, Krystkowiak had not received an invitation to be the “guest picker” on Saturday morning’s broadcast of ESPN’s “College GameDay” program at Presidents Circle. If asked, though, Coach K would accept the invite and pick winners of football games on the show. \n“Yeah, heck yeah,” Krystkowiak said. “But maybe I don’t have enough star power.” \nREMEMBERING 1998: The 1997-98 Utah men’s basketball team that reached the national championship game will be introduced at halftime of Saturday’s football game between Utah and California at Rice-Eccles Stadium. They’re being inducted into the Crimson Club Athletic Fund Hall of Fame this year. \n“We hope to get that team over here and visit with our guys,” Krystkowiak said. “There’s a lot of pride from that team.” \nSTANDING TALL: Krystkowiak said center Jakob Poeltl is making strides after adding 30 pounds to his 7-foot frame since joining the team last year. Areas of emphasis include establishing some go-to moves in the post and getting to the point where he can make three out of every four attempts from the free-throw line. \nPoeltl, who had nine games with four or more fouls as a freshman, was praised by Krystkowiak for being a “supreme athlete for a 7-footer” with a great set of hands. \nEXTRA STUFF: The annual “Night with the Runnin’ Utes” is set for Oct. 21 ... Utah has an exhibition game with Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 5 and opens non-conference play against Southern Utah on Nov. 13. Both games are slated for the Huntsman Center ... The Pac-12 men’s basketball media day is set for Thursday, Oct. 15 in San Francisco ... In emphasizing that he’s not a system guy, Krystkowiak said the Utes have already added things they didn’t run at all last year over the first five days of practice. \nTwitter: @DirkFacer Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:24:35.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
