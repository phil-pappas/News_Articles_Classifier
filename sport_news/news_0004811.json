I look forward to playing. We’ll see what happens, but I’m out there. When my number’s called, I’m going to be out there looking to make plays.” \nCoach Rex Ryan did not deny that McCoy will attempt to play. \"I feel pretty good (about it) and sometimes the experts get it wrong,\" said Ryan. \"He makes a huge difference; he's a super talent.\" Sammy Watkins speaks out about role in offense \nMcCoy originally hurt his hamstring in mid-August in training camp at St. John Fisher College and missed the final three games of the preseason. He was back for the start of the regular season, but wasn't very productive in the first two games. He then tweaked the injury in practice leading up to the Week 3 game in Miami, and during that game, he was clearly hampered and ultimately had to come out. He hasn't played since. \nHowever, with the Bills at 3-2 and their offense sputtering badly since he and Sammy Watkins have been sidelined, McCoy recognizes the need to return and if he has to, play through some pain. \n\"Just how the season has gone, we need this win; it's a big one,\" he said. \"A lot of guys are banged up. Maybe get a big win here, get one more (against Jacksonville in London next week). Go into the bye week and have some time to get healthy; full week of no running and just treatments. So that's the mindset. Hurt or not, we need this win. So I'm out there for my teammates.\" Bills defense has its hands full vs. Bengals Sal Maiorana and Leo Roth preview the Bills showdown with the undefeated Bengals on Oct. 18. \nRyan wasn't quite as forthcoming on the Bills' quarterback situation. Starter Tyrod Taylor was officially listed as questionable with a knee injury, but Ryan isn't ready to rule him out of the game. \n“I think he wants to go, there’s no doubt about that,” Ryan said. “But we’ll see. He’s feeling a lot better, put it to you that way. As the week’s gone on, he’s looked better and better, if that’s any indication.” \nIf Taylor can't play, EJ Manuel would get his first start since Week 4 of the 2014 season and the former first-round pick said he’ll be ready for the opportunity should it come. \n“Yeah, I’m very eager to see what happens for Sunday, but I definitely feel confident in what I can do,” said Manuel. “I think my teammates feel the same way. I know obviously Tyrod’s going to try his best to go out there and play, but if he doesn’t, I’ll just go out there and help our team win. You have to believe in yourself. As I've gotten older, that's one thing I've learned. You have to play the whole game, 60 minutes. You can't get upset if the first quarter doesn't go how you want it to.” -- Ryan was asked about Watkins’ comments in The Buffalo News regarding his frustration over not being targeted often enough in the games he has played. Predictably, Ryan had no problem with it. \n“He's like every other wideout,\" Ryan said. \"You know, (Chris) Hogan said the same darn thing. Just 'give me the ball, give me the ball, give me the ball.' But look, we all get it, the guy is a tremendous talent. He's frustrated because he hadn't played. He's been out. So yeah, he's hungry. He wants to be out there, wants to be with his teammates and contribute. I think that's the big thing. Hey, get him the ball, that's fine. But I'd rather him get it on the field than out on the sideline.\" \n-- The Bills ruled running back Karlos Williams and special teams ace Marcus Easley out of the game. Williams has not been seen around the Bills facility since going into the NFL’s concussion protocol 10 days ago. Easley suffered a shoulder injury against Tennessee and did not practice during the week. \nMAIORANA@Gannett.com 7 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1LxZvpx TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:47:41.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
