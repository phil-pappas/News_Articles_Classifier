It’ll be another defensive, low-scoring game, but with DeSean back (hopefully) Good Cousins makes an appearance and the Skins win. \nJP Finlay : Jets, 24-16 \nI thought the Falcons were overrated and Skins would keep it close. I think Jets are underrated and will win by a TD or more. \nAndy Peden: Jets, 27-23 \nAt some point the Skins will make a bad QB look good. I say it’s this week (and probably next week too). \nTodd Davis : Redskins, 13-12 \nWhy so down, everyone? We’re somewhat competent and the Jets are a mirror image (defense, turnover-prone slinger) with a better record. I’ll take Alf over Ivory though and Skins to win. Also, #GAMEDAY2JMU \nNo Trent Williams, no dice. \nComposite prediction: Jets, 21-17", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:03:16.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
