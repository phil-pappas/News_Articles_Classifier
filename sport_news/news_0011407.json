Quetta, Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore and Islamabad are the five city-based teams that will take part in the first edition of the PSL, set to take place from February 4-24, 2016 in Dubai and Sharjah, according to a PCB statement. Interested parties may obtain the relevant bid documents from the PSL Head Office in Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, before November. The franchise ownership rights are being sold for a term of 10 years. The bids will have two proposals - technical and financial. “We are very keen on ensuring that all five franchise owners are technically equipped to build the team in all aspects and the same shall reflect in our process of bringing franchise owners on board,” said Chairman PSL Governing Council, Najam Sethi. With the awarding of team rights, the player draft will be the next key event. Top Pakistani cricketers, both national and domestic, will be joined by more than 150 foreign players in the PSL player draft. Star foreign T20 players such as Chris Gayle, Shane Watson, Kevin Pietersen, Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine are some of the top cricketers who have signed up with PSL.
