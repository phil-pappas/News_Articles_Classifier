(AP) - A settlement has been proposed in a lawsuit brought by several retirees against Pascagoula's Singing River Health System when the pension plan was almost terminated last year.\nLocal media outlets report the agreement says the health system will contribute $142 million to the floundering pension fund between 2016 and 2051. The county would give the system $13.6 million to operate over the next several years.\nThe plan would not require a tax increase.\nUnder the plan, the court would appoint a four-member authority to oversee the operation of the health system. The pension fund affects 600 people.\nPlaintiff attorney Earl Denham says the plan isn't financially viable.\nJackson County supervisors will likely discuss the agreement Monday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
