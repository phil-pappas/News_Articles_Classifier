Steven Branscombe / USA TODAY Sports By Luke Meredith AP Oct 26, 2015 at 2:02p ET 0Shares \nAMES, Iowa -- Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads says offensive coordinator Mark Mangino, a former head coach at KU, has left the program. \nRhoads says he and Mangino haven't been on the same page for weeks. Rhoads wouldn't say whether Mangino quit or was fired. \nThe move Monday came on the same day Iowa State promoted sophomore Joel Lanning to a starting role over senior Sam Richardson, but Rhoads says Lanning's promotion was not the reason Mangino left. \nRhoads announced that passing game coordinator Todd Sturdy will take over for Mangino, starting with Saturday's game against Texas (3-4, 2-2 Big 12). \nMangino was 50-48 in eight seasons as the coach at Kansas. He joined Rhoads' staff prior to last season. \nIowa State (2-5, 1-3) is averaging 26.9 points per game. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:28:46.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
