And seeing how things have played out so far — with PSJA Southwest (1-1) and Porter (1-1) in contention while PSJA High, Brownsville Pace and Donna North are winless — that makes Thursday’s game at PSJA Stadium between the Javelinas and Cowboys vital. \n“It’s a big game for us and big for them,” PSJA Southwest coach Jesus Reyes said. “It’s going to be one step forward going to the playoffs. The kids understand that.” \nLast season, it came down to PSJA Southwest and PSJA High for the final playoff spot. \nPSJA High won 27-0 in the second district game for each team. That meant Southwest had to beat a top-three team (again, either Mercedes, Edcouch-Elsa or Donna) to get in, and it didn’t. The Javelinas finished a game out of the playoffs. \nWinning today would give PSJA Southwest a leg up. \n“Our goal is to be 2-1 in district,” Reyes said. “We want to control our own destiny.” \nPorter and Southwest have similar styles. Each boasts an elite running back (Jesus Acosta at PSJA Southwest and Jorge Gutierrez at Porter). \nGutierrez is the district’s top running back with 1,003 yards and 13 touchdowns, and Acosta is fourth (609 yards, five TDs) despite playing the last two games with a broken bone in his hand. \nEach team has an offense that can sustain drives and kill clock. And each has a defense that leaves a lot to be desired. \nWhile Porter and Southwest are two of the top three rushing teams in 32-5A, they are also the worst in stopping the run. \nFor more on this story, visit RGVSports.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:07:02.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
