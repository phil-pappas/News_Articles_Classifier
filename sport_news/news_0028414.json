But, we’re still on Bowl Watch 2016 thanks to an impressive 4-2 start to the 2015-16 season for Kentucky football. So, where do people project the Wildcats to be playing in the postseason? \nCBS Sports has Kentucky playing against Cincinnati in the Birmingham Bowl.

Look, we all love Nashville, so let’s chalk this one up as a win. \nSaturday Down South has the battle of Wildcats as Kentucky will be taking on Kansas State in the Liberty Bowl. \nObviously any bowl game would be considered a successful season for Kentucky, but out of these three which one does BBN prefer?
