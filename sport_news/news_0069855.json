McConnell knocked down a baseline jumper with 6.5 seconds left to lift Philadelphia to a 97-95 victory over the Nets.\nAs the teams headed off the court after Brooklyn failed to force overtime, Grant signed autographs and posed for selfies with fans wearing Syracuse gear.\n\"I love all the Syracuse fans,\" Grant said. \"Being back in the area, it is amazing to see how much people actually care for you and respect you. It makes feel loved, especially when the fans are that great.\"\nThose in attendance Saturday paid between $25 and $115 (courtside seats) to take what was technically a 76ers' home game. That's a much cheaper proposition than getting tickets to any regular-season game in Brooklyn or Philadelphia.\nA number of area varsity basketball players turned out for the game. So did boys' basketball coaches Jamil Hood Sr. (Green Tech) and Jeff Huneau (Cohoes).\nWhat fans witnessed was a game that was sloppy most of the way until things ramped up in the fourth quarter.\nOkafor, the 19-year-old who was the No. 3 overall pick in June's draft, played just three minutes in the second half. The 6-foot-11, 270-pounder made his only basket with 8:24 remaining in the third quarter, finishing with two points (1-for-6 shooting), four rebounds and four turnovers in 16 minutes.\n\"I have to work on my entire game. I wouldn't pinpoint one thing,\" Okafor said. \"I have to keep progressing through the preseason.\"\nLike Okafor, Grant struggled early trying to find a comfort level. The 6-8 small forward sprang to life in the fourth quarter as he scored 10 of his 12 points. He added four rebounds and two blocked shots.\n\"It felt great,\" Grant said. \"I got off to a slow start. I couldn't get going, but I found my game and had a good fourth quarter.\"\njallen@timesunion.com • 518-454-5062 • @TUSidelines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:25:07.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
