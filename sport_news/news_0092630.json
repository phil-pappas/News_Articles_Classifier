This allows him to maintain nearly 85 percent of his linear speed, even when he redirects his forward momentum by as much as 60 degrees. And perhaps Fournette's best skill is his ridiculous top-end speed. On his 87-yard TD run , he accelerated to over 20 miles an hour. That was fast enough to out-run the pursuing defensive backs Rico McWilliams and Al Harris Jr., even though Fournette outweighs each of them by at least 44 pounds.\"", "external_links": ["http://player.espn.com/player.js?playerBrandingId=4ef8000cbaf34c1687a7d9a26fe0e89e&adSetCode=91cDU6NuXTGKz3OdjOxFdAgJVtQcKJnI&pcode=1kNG061cgaoolOncv54OAO1ceO-I&width=576&height=324&externalId=espn:13876833&thruParam_espn-ui"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:31:45.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
