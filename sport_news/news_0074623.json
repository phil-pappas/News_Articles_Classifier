Home plate umpire Dale Scott originally ruled the ball dead, but overturned the call on replay, prompting Toronto to play the game under protest. \nThen in the bottom of the inning, Texas gave the game away. \nElvis Andrus bobbled a ground ball, Mitch Moreland threw low to second base on a force attempt and Andrus dropped a ball at third after a bunt to load the bases. The Jays go tthe tying run on a bloop to right that went for a force play before Bautista hit a no doubter to left to send the Jays to their first postseason series win since 1993. \nThe Jays will play the winner of the Kansas City/Houston game in the first game of the ALCS. The Jays would travel to Kansas City or host Houston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:32:38.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
