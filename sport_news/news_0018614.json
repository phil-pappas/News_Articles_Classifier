In a sense, the Taft girls golf team was unable to find some after finishing second at the South Sequoia League Championship. “It has been a great season for the Wildcats in every way and the relationships we’ve built with the players and coaches from the other schools, especially BCHS has made finishing behind them at least a little more palatable,” said Taft coach Mike Cowan. Overall, Taft finished with a round of 539. In order to make it as a team to Monday’s Area, the team had to shoot under 500. Bakersfield Christian finished first with a round of 493. By winning the league title, the Lady Eagles automatically advanced to area. Wasco was third in the championship with a 632. Individually, Kathryn Tracy had the lowest score of the day for the Lady Wildcats with an 89. By finishing second behind Bakersfield Christian’s Madi Daniel’s three over 75, Tracy got medalist honors and qualified for Area this past Monday. Only the individual players who shot under 100 qualified for Area. Ruta Iotamo followed Tracy with a 101 and was tied for third best of the day and got medalist honors. Cindy Kindrick followed with a 111 while Sierra Pilgrim was one stroke back with a 112. Jadynn Rosenberger chipped in with a 126 while Hailee Rosenberger rounded out the scoring for Taft with a 130. “Individually, our girls showed significant improvement during the season,” said Cowan. “Ruta Iotamo was by far the most improved, followed by Cindy Kendrick and Jadynn Rosenberger.” Cowan felt the same of the returning players. “Our returning starters from previous seasons, Hailee Lopez, Sierra Pilgrim and Kathryn Tracy formed the foundation of our team this season and all not only showed improvement in their games, but growth off the course as well,” said Cowan. Along with finishing second in the championship, Taft also finished second in the South Sequoia League standings with 88 points. Bakersfield Christian won with 108 points while Wasco was third with 66 points.
