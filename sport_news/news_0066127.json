Coolbaugh rushed for 132 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Red Hook High School football team over Pine Plains/Rhinebeck, 62-7, on Saturday. \nNick Morrissey ran for 128 yards and two touchdowns, and Nick Michitsch added two touchdowns for the Raiders (3-5). Tristan Schiafo scored and had an interception, and Devin Scott had a touchdown. \nAlex Thiry also snagged an interception, and Tanner Guidi kicked eight extra points. Red Hook racked up 477 total yards, including 389 on the ground. \nRaiders coach Bill Stutz lauded Scott for playing well on both ends. “(Scott) broke his thumb the first game of the season, and this was only his second game back. He was always at practice and always helping out and it was great to see him back on the field.” \nRed Hook faces Saugerties or Ellenville in an outbracket game at 1:30 p.m. Saturday. \nMillbrook 40, Fallsburg 12 — Delvin Wood ran for 116 yards and two touchdowns — needing only four carries — and caught a 56-yard touchdown to lead visiting Millbrook on Friday. \nCody Homa ran for 71 yards and a touchdown, and Christian Williams scored a 41-yard touchdown. Jacob Wright completed 2 of 3 passes for 95 yards and a score, and Sam Storey had a 1-yard touchdown run. Chris Ross, Peter Rudivic, and Mike Triglia each made seven tackles. \nMillbrook (7-1) faces Chester in the Section 9 Class C semifinals at noon Saturday. \n\"We're preparing for Chester now,\" Blazers coach Sean Keenan said. \"We've got to tighten up on the mistakes we've made throughout the year.\" \nHighland 35, Ellenville 6 — Quarterback Mike Doxey threw for a touchdown and rushed for another to lead host Highland on Friday. Paul Hansut had two touchdown receptions. \nThe Huskies played their second straight game without head coach Carl Relyea, whom assistant coach Billy Phillips said is \"having problems with his Achilles tendons.\" \nMike Malheiro's touchdown staked Highland to a 7-6 halftime lead, but the Huskies dominated the second half. \n“We’ve been shuffling kids around in different spots,” Phillips said. “It was a tough spot for (Doxey) because he doesn’t get a lot of reps at quarterback. He stepped up and did real well.” \nHighland (2-6) receives a bowl game next week against an opponent yet to be determined. \nGoshen 13, Poughkeepsie 7 — Malik Lewis caught a 65-yard touchdown pass from Troy Schoonmaker for host Poughkeepsie on Friday. With the loss, the Pioneers (4-4) narrowly missed clinching a playoff berth. \n\"Obviously there are a lot of broken hearts,” Poughkeesie coach Jerry North said. “But we weren’t blaming each other.” \nThe Pioneers improved greatly from its one-win season last year. After losing three of its first four games, Poughkeepsie had a late-season surge with three late-game wins that put it on the doorstep of the playoffs. \nPoughkeepsie will compete in a bowl game next week against an opponent to be determined. \n“(The team) became better at life and have the attitude of not quitting when you’re down and out,” North said. \nKingston 33, Franklin D. Roosevelt 22 — Matt Amone threw two touchdown passes for host Roosevelt on Friday. He hit Tyler Vansteenburgh for a 34-yard score and E.J. Cameron for a 47-yard touchdown. \nAmone, a junior, started at quarterback in place of Justin Guerrero, who re-aggravated a knee injury in the Presidents’ loss to Minisink Valley last week, Roosevelt coach Brian Bellino said. Guerrero will sit out the remainder of the season. \nJake Niesen added a 6-yard touchdown run for the Presidents (1-7). \nRoosevelt will compete in a bowl game against an opponent to be determined. 1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pojonews.co/1S3qwST TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:12:16.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
