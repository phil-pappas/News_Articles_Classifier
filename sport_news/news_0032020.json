For now. \nMorgan played 90 minutes for the World Cup champion U.S. in their 1-1 draw with Brazil on Wednesday night amid reports that she was on the verge of being sent to the expansion Orlando Pride of the National Women’s Soccer League. \nMorgan has played with Portland for the past three seasons. The new Orlando team was announced Tuesday and will begin play next season. Morgan’s husband, Servando Carrasco, plays for Major League Soccer’s Orlando City. \n“I’m with Portland as of right now, so nothing’s confirmed,” Morgan said after the match. “Obviously, my husband does play there, so I’m in Orlando a lot, but there’s nothing right now that I can confirm.” \nSports Illustrated first reported the deal that would send Morgan and Canadian Kaylyn Kyle to Orlando for the Pride’s first pick in the NWSL draft, two international slots, and U.S. national team defender Meghan Klingenberg, currently with the Houston Dash. \nThe Thorns didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The U.S. will continue its victory tour with a match against Brazil on Sunday in Orlando. \n“If an opportunity arose where I was in Orlando that would be a great opportunity to be with my husband and be part of an expansion team and the continued success of the NWSL,” Morgan said. \nThe 26-year-old Morgan is one of the most popular female players in the world. She was on the U.S. team that won the Women’s World Cup this summer in Canada. She first made a splash at the London Olympics when she scored the overtime winner for the United States in a semifinal victory over Canada. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:32:42.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
