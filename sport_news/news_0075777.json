Afterward, he blamed himself for the Jays’ loss. \nHis teammates didn’t. \n“I didn’t think it was a big deal,” said Troy Tulowitzki, whose three-run homer keyed a third-inning rally. “I think everybody in that locker room had his back. Tonight, for him to put together the at-bats that he did, play great defence, he deserved it. He put his head down and he focused on the next game. That’s what you do in this game.” \nCall it redemption if you like – many will – but Goins was not to blame for that seventh-inning meltdown in Game 2. Granted, he should have caught the pop-up down the right-field line, which he gave up on because he thought he heard Jose Bautista call for it. But what followed – five KC hits and runs – had more to do with David Price’s pitching and the Royals’ gritty at-bats than with Goins’ gaffe. \nAsked after Monday’s win whether he felt he needed redemption, Goins did not hesitate. \n“No,” he said. “There’s no need putting extra pressure on yourself. Just come out and do what I’ve been doing all season.” \nJays’ fans are accustomed to his sparkling defence. But gradually during the regular season, he began to shed his good-field, no-hit reputation. While he batted .250 in 128 games, from mid-August onward he hit .305 with a .372 on-base percentage in 39 games. \nEntering Monday’s game, he was just two-for 23 in the playoffs. But in the second inning, his tenacity resulted in one of the team’s biggest at-bats of the post-season. \nAs he stepped in for his first face-off with Johnny Cueto, the Royals led 1-0. Two were out. Runners led off second and third. \nGoins took a strike, then swung and missed. He took two heaters for balls. He fouled off three straight pitches, then took another ball. Back from 0-2 to a full count. \nAnd on the ninth pitch, an 85-mile-an-hour slider – nine miles an hour slower than the previous pitch – Goins poked a single into left field. Tulowitzki scored easily from third. Kevin Pillar raced around from second, slid adroitly around the tag and banged his head into the dirt. \nToronto led 2-1, and never trailed after that, although the Royals kept the pressure on until the very end. \nWhen Goins hit his homer in the fifth, it seemed superfluous. In the ninth inning, when Kansas City scored four times, it began to feel significant. \nBack on Saturday, and during Sunday’s workout day, the media made much of the Game 2 play in which Bautista backed off when Goins signaled that he would catch that pop-up. When he answered media questions after that game, Bautista tried to avoid casting blame on Goins. Some reports construed his terse remarks as doing just that, and subsequently on social media, Bautista bristled at that interpretation. \nBut Goins said Bautista’s position on the subject was never ambiguous. \n“I know he has my back every day,” Goins said. “And I don’t read anything from the outside sources. He came up to me on the plane and told me he had my back, and we’ll just move past it. That’s what we did today.” © Copyright (c) National Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:29:24.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
