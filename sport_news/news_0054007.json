He ended the session 1.4 seconds adrift of Hulkenberg in seventh place. \nHulkenberg was 0.052 sec faster than Rosberg while Vettel, who also spun in the testing track conditions, was third fastest. \nSergio Perez was next up in his Force India with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in fifth and Carlos Sainz sixth for Toro Rosso. \nButton ended the session in 11th with Alonso, competing in his 250th grand prix weekend, 14th. \nMeanwhile, rain is forecast for the second session later on Friday, which could again result in limited track running.
