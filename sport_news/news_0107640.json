Holien says company officials told him they decided to go in another direction. \nHe says he's had an amazing run and doesn't hold any animosity. \nHolien has been the play-by-play broadcaster for Griz sporting events for 31 years. This is his 23rd season broadcasting men's football and basketball games. \nHolien says his favorite memories include Montana winning the 1995 and 2001 football championships and the Lady Griz beating Wisconsin in the NCAA women's basketball tournament in 1986. \nLearfield spokeswoman Jennifer Duncan did not immediately return a call for comment Wednesday.
