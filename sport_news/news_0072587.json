For awhile Friday night, it appeared the Panthers might have to rely on it since Watchung Hills was making things a bit difficult on homecoming night at Basilone Field. \nThe game was tied 14-14 at halftime. \nBut in a stretch of 13 seconds in the third quarter, the unbeaten and No. 3-ranked Panthers took the game away with two touchdowns that led to a 42-28 victory that delivered the Mid-State 38 Delaware Division title — a first for B-R since 1993. \nSenior quarterback Eric Nickel's 60-yard touchdown pass to Nick Attanasio and a 40-yard pick six by Jonny Kaye on the very next play from scrimmage gave B-R a 28-14 lead. The Panthers then forced a three-and-out before going on a 7-play, 80-yard touchdown drive capped by Nickel';s three-yard TD pass to tight end Mike Celli. Justin Davidovicz PAT extended the lead to 35-14. \n\"I just read him like a book. I saw it the whole way through. I left my man early, but I had faith in that. I saw it was a 10-0 yard in, my man ran deep but I just helped over the top,'' said Kay. \"It was like starting at 0-0 after the half. \n\"It's awesome to be part of it and be part of history is awesome,'' said Kay. \"It's a long journey, but it's not the only thing we're interested in getting.'' \nWatchung Hills kept pressing, but the Panthers (6-0) got that touchdown lead they really needed. Bridgewater-Raritan had wins over Phillipsburg and Elizabeth, so even if it lost to Franklin next week, the Panthers would have their title. \n\"Jonny's play was huge,'' said Nickel. \"I feel great having won it, it's crazy. It's almost like a dream, it's awesome no other way to put it.'' \n\"Kay's pick was huge, we had to get up two scores, it was big, but Watchung Hills kept fighting throughout the whole game, give em credit,'' said coach Scott Bray. \nThe line didn't play as well in the first half, but Watchung Hills matched it. \n\"They played like it was playoff game,\" said Bray of Watchung Hills. \"They played tough on the run. But we were able to get players in open space, and defensively we settled in and played tough.'' \nThe Panthers currently are the top seed in North 2 Group V and will stay that way with one more divisional game left at Franklin on Friday night followed by crossovers with North Hunterdon and Ridge to end the regular season. 70 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RNIo3T TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:25:43.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
