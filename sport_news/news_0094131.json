The 52 points are the most Boise State has ever allowed as a ranked team. \nThe Broncos (5-2, 2-1) served up four fumbles and three interceptions in the first half, including a 90-yard interception return for a touchdown by Marwin Evans as time expired in the first half. \nUtah State's Kent Meyers threw for 157 yards and a career-high three touchdowns and added 63 yards rushing and a touchdown.

(AP) - After missing the last two games with a hamstring strain, Marshawn Lynch is expected to return to the starting lineup for Sunday's game against the Carolina Panthers. \nLinebacker Bobby Wagner will be a game-time decision. \nLynch did not start against the Chicago Bears in Week 3 due to a calf injury and then exited the game for good in the second quarter after straining his hamstring before halftime. The two games missed were the first games in which Lynch was inactive since being traded to Seattle in 2010. \nLynch participated fully in practice on Thursday and Friday. \nSEAHAWKS-COLEMAN ARRESTED \nNo immediate charging decision for Seahawks' Coleman \nSEATTLE (AP) - Authorities say they'll wait until an investigation is complete before deciding whether to file criminal charges against Seattle Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman, who was arrested following a crash that injured a man. \nColeman is being investigated for vehicular assault and felony hit-and-run. \nDan Donohoe, a spokesman for the King County prosecutor, said in a statement Friday that Coleman was being released from jail and that he wouldn't appear in court. The investigation into Wednesday's incident, including full toxicology test results, was expected to take at least a month. \nColeman was booked into King County Jail early Thursday and initially denied bail. Bellevue police officers said they arrested him because he left the scene of the two-car accident Wednesday evening. \nSteve Hayne, one of Coleman's lawyers, has said Coleman was \"in shock\" and didn't flee or go far from the scene.
