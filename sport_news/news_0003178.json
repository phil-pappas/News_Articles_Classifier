What is interesting and fairly sad is that UL has many professors, students and season ticket holders that are women, mothers daughters etc and they don’t really seem to care. Where is their outrage? When does a fanbase, faculty or student body reach the point of taking a stand? Cat's Other Paw October 9, 2015 at 11:56 am | Permalink \nThis is an excellent point about Devonte Fields. Moreover, I’d be interested in all of the football and basketball players who have transferred in or permitted to remain enrolled at Louisville after committing sexual and/or violent offenses against females during the reign of Jurich. Ultimately, it matters none. Pitino will be regarded a legend for winning national championships at multiple schools, Petrino is invincible, and Jurich will be bolting soon to Texas (or somewhere similar) where he will make three times the salary he currently makes. The NCAA punishes student-athletes and schools, never coaches or administrators. J-Dub421 October 9, 2015 at 12:11 pm | Permalink \nDon’t forget that Petrino pulled the scholarship offer that nice kid from South Carolina (I think it was South Carolina), for Fields the day before signing day.

There are a few despicable acts that have taken place in the athletic department, but for SI to title this story “Louisville created and continues to nurture dangerous culture for women” is absolutely absurd and completely misleading. In fact, The University of Louisville is by far ranked the safest major University in the state— A ranking in which UK only ranks ahead of UPike and Kentucky State. \nAnd for you… I’m absolutely disgusted how humored and entertained you are by this whole situation. \n“It’s only 104 pages, and although it can be hard to read at times, the parts about Katina and her girls going to the UofL dorm make it a page-turner. \nE-book: $9.99 on Amazon Butter Lovers Microwave Popcorn: $3.98/12-pack” \n“if taking joy in this makes you a bad person, we’ll party in hell together.” \nI’M GLAD YOU THINK A GROWN WOMEN SOLICITING HER UNDERAGE DAUGHTERS FOR PROSTITUTION IS FUNNY. \nYou are clearly a hypocrite and care nothing more than to bash Louisville and get as much entertainment as you can from such a terrible situation. This is much bigger than sports or a rivalry. \nYou have no class, and I’m sickened by you finding this entertaining. Enjoy burning in hell.

The writers of this page pander to the willful ignorance of the UK fanbase who will gobble up piss in their cheerios if matt jones pours it in there. And then tell you how delicious it is. When i come to this page the thought that crosses my mind prior to doing so is, “i wonder what these bigots/assholes are talking about today” \nits sad but true, whether drew and tyler believe what they put in print is neither here nor there. the fact that they print it, knowing that it appeals to backward thinking racist rednecks who will lap up anything they say, just to make money and a name for their website is truly disgusting. \nand another thing, IT IS KSR. not LSR. they bash UL fans for caring about UK, but none of our major blogs give them any coverage. maybe once a month. even in a down time of year, there is at least one mention of UL in a negative light on the first page whenever i check the sight out. talk about insecurity. maybe you wouldn’t be so insecure if you had more than basketball to cheer about CATandMONKEY October 9, 2015 at 12:22 pm | Permalink \nLouisville student: Save your energy for exams. Your outrage should be directed towards the perpetrators of these acts, not the media outlets that choose to report/comment on such ridiculous travesties. \nAs a UofL undergraduate alum I am ashamed and embarrassed by the decisions of the athletic department and administration over the past 10 -15 years.

Please get over yourselves. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t matter if the girls were 17 3/4 years old or 18 years old. Focus on the fact that the “win at all costs” mentality at UL really does have costs. The cost in this case is hookers in the basketball dorms, and the crushing NCAA penalties forthcoming. Your athletics department is a dumpster fire and it has nothing to do with how everyone, including UK fans, saw it coming and are now laughing at you. theSkinny81 October 9, 2015 at 12:33 pm | Permalink \nHey, Louisville Student and danny, here’s an idea you might want to pass on to your Athletics Dept.: \nSTOP.

You say that the headline is misleading…in what way? The author of this article clearly indicates that the issue is the culture and mentality that has become increasingly prevalent in college athletics. He also argues that the manner in which UL has conducted itself over the past decade plus does nothing but encourage that mentality. That’s a hard argument to refute. And no one is delighting in the fact that this horrible woman pimped out her daughters, or that grown men would condone and pay for such things…it’s sickening. What is entertaining is the irrational portion of your fan base(there are plenty of rational ones as well) that continues to somehow try to spin this situation or muddy the waters; or worse yet, continue to throw out ‘these are just allegations from an untrustworthy source’ arguments. What is entertaining is that we joke about the lack of class, etc in the UL administration often, and now those jokes are being shown to, in fact, be true! It’s equal parts sadness in seeing innocent people get abused, and hilarity because of UL fans’ continued attempts to just look the other way!

Then you rehire a football coach that basically took a dump on your program when he left and then had his own sex scandal where he lied to the police and the school. Arkansas then fired him. IMO, and everybody’s got one, it tells people that your school doesn’t care how you treat women and that culture has trickled down to the players. I agree with you that it is terrible that underage girls were involved. Louisville has made their bed and now that they will have to sleep in it. WatchinginCali October 9, 2015 at 1:25 pm | Permalink \nWhat is sad is that the UL fan base is standing around supporting any of these clowns. If this happened anywhere on a college campus – administration, academic departments, medical schools – the entirety of the staff and faculty would be summarily dismissed. With no questions asked. \nThe only thing that makes this an issue is the money associated with the program and the overall winning percentage of Pitino. That is the very definition of win at all costs. \nYou admitted yourself that the whole thing is disturbing and disgusting. All you need to do now is take the other step and realize that there HAS to be a change in personnel or you will have (unwittingly) reinforced the behavior. That’s it. You either care about the morally-corrupt behaviors, the lives that were impacted and the illegal nature of what was going on in your athletic department or you don’t. There is no in-between. And the decision to support a coach and AD that allowed this to happen places you squarely in the latter. yarg October 9, 2015 at 12:14   \nI’m not going to go as far as “burn in hell” dude, but it probably is about time to step back and stop the “tee-hee look how embarrassing this is for UL” and recognize that there are real human beings in this story.

Booby Petrino October 9, 2015 at 1:33 pm | Permalink \nLol Louisville student is more worried about what KSR posts than they are about what disgusting things they’re school is responsible for. Classic Tard! Sweating this site to give your opinion that mostly everyone here is laughing at, while lining the pockets of those you are disgusted by. More comments + more clicks = more money for Matt and the rest of the crew that you want to burn. Oh goodness, the idiocy of Louisville fans knows no depths. GroundControlToNumber9 October 9, 2015 at 12:16   \nThis narrative is overkill and unsubstantiated… \nNone of the women involved with the coaches previous decisions or players were put in dangerous situations from the details that have been presented. Well, other than Petrino wrecking a motorcycle… but that’s transportation choices and not part of the narrative being attempt here. \nMedia uses the word ‘dangerous’ in this situation to sell tickets to the show (that includes you Tyler by quoting it). \nThe women: \n—– Pitino’s Affiar: …..Karen Sypher – An adult who chose to ‘play for pay’…..Pitino’s wife – An adult who was cheated on. We don’t know the full story here so I’ll leave it at that. \n—– Petrino’s Affiar: …..Jessica Dorrell – The girlfriend climbing the ladder in the UA athletics department…..Petrino’s wife – An adult who was cheated on. We don’t know the full story here so I’ll leave it at that. \n—– Breaking Cardinal Rules: …..Katina Powell – An adult who sold a service and enjoyed the power it gave her. Made money off story.…..Daughter 1 – An Adult. Mom brought them into the ‘be with basketball stars’&‘even get paid to do it’ dream…..Daughter 2 – An Adult. Mom brought them into the ‘be with basketball stars’&‘even get paid to do it’ dream…..Daughter 3 – Underage. Mom brought them into the ‘be with basketball stars’&‘even get paid to do it’ dream. \n– \nLouisville Basketball is culpable for a program ‘out of control’ regardless of if Pitino had any knowledge of ‘paid girls for players’. But the ‘dangerous’ bit is unproven as is the ‘continues to’ line in the SI sentence. \nBy putting her children in a situation where money was exchanged with an underage girl will likely put Katina Powell in jail (regardless of the justification, “these are the guys my girls wanted to be with and I encouraged and facilitated their connecting under the premise they were the most popular athletes in town and had the most potential (in regards to guys my girls could get the attention of) to be wealthy some day”). \nIf anything the SI title should be (click bait cleaned): Louisville had a program that was out of control and broken the law with women who aren’t concerned about it. papasnapper October 9, 2015 at 1:38 pm | Permalink \nI think you’ve missed the point. He is questioning the culture of teaching young men that women are only objects to be played with and dismissed. NOT what I would teach my children or grandchildren, nor want them to be taught while under another adult’s guidance. Booby Petrino October 9, 2015 at 1:41 pm | Permalink \noverkill and unsubstantiated? It is dangerous for women when men in powerful positions (ie coaches who young men look up to) teach young men that women are nothing more than sex objects. Rick, Bobby, and even Jurich are men of power and have done nothing to show that they respect women, and have only done the opposite. It is extremely dangerous. Rape and abuse of women come from men who weren’t taught to respect women. It comes from men who were shown that women are nothing but objects for them to control. One women even lost her job at UofL for speaking out against that culture. But hey, it wasn’t your job so let’s just call it overkill for her to be upset about that. So your headline “Louisville had a program that was out of control and broken the law with women who aren’t concerned about it” does not apply to all women discussed in the article. She cared, and she lost her job. Poppschmidty October 9, 2015 at 12:17   \nWe’ve had this a week now…it’s not our (THE BBN’s) problem. I will say that all the talk is about Pitino, but it may be time to look higher up than him at Jurich. Sad state of college athletics right now. Stay classy, my friends.

RICK October 9, 2015 at 12:35   \nI remember 15 years ago or so when Louisville hired Pitino the fans would post GOT PITINO, I think the GOT MILK slogan was popular back then . I am so glad they have GOT PITINO.

As in…”I GOT the clap” or “Oh, He’s GOT HIV”. He is a the sexual scandal disease that keeps giving…and UL is the host that doesn’t know that it isn’t normal for their pee to burn. Bluegrassstu October 9, 2015 at 12:35   \nBoth Pitino and Petrino should not be allowed to coach. Both have committed immoral sex deeds, if my children were offered scholarships to play sports for either coach, I would not allow it. In my opinion Jurich and Ramsey are desperate to be relevant on the major college sport scene. UKBlue1! October 9, 2015 at 12:52 pm | Permalink \n“Both have committed immoral sex deeds”.

Bobbum man October 9, 2015 at 12:43   \nThese UL fans are absolutely priceless, I’ve never seen a more dillusional fan base in my life. Now that we all but know the allegations to be true they try to spin it around on us with things like “these are actual humans involved” and how we shouldn’t be taking joy in it. What an absolute croc of s***. You guys would be eating this up if it were UK. As for the women, yes if she prositutued her Underage kids that’s a different issue and I highly doubt anyone is laughing at that aspect of The story. What I find funny is that you guys still don’t have any issue with ur university, with ur continued lack of care for decent people as leaders and players. But yet you are suprised something like this happened, and that no way Rick could possibly know. The article hit the nail on the head, you guys created this culture, pitino and Petrino, all the thugs kicked out of various schools for various rules/crimes. It’s not all some big coincedence, U put winning at all costs as the most important thing of ur program and it did well for a few years U became relevant in football and basketball again, and we all know about ur rifle shooting dominance. But it was only a matter of time with the jurich/pitino/Petrino dream team that it all came crashing down. What’s astonishing is that they all come out publicly supporting one another immediately instead of looking into these issues and why they’re happening. It’s comin crashing down cards and while I wish the best for that ladies children, in my opinion ur university 100% deserves a severe punishment and deserves every bit of it. #BringDownTheBanner CC4UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:39:04.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
