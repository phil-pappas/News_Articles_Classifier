What is interesting and fairly sad is that UL has many professors, students and season ticket holders that are women, mothers daughters etc and they don‚Äôt really seem to care. Where is their outrage? When does a fanbase, faculty or student body reach the point of taking a stand? Cat's Other Paw October 9, 2015 at 11:56 am | Permalink \nThis is an excellent point about Devonte Fields. Moreover, I‚Äôd be interested in all of the football and basketball players who have transferred in or permitted to remain enrolled at Louisville after committing sexual and/or violent offenses against females during the reign of Jurich. Ultimately, it matters none. Pitino will be regarded a legend for winning national championships at multiple schools, Petrino is invincible, and Jurich will be bolting soon to Texas (or somewhere similar) where he will make three times the salary he currently makes. The NCAA punishes student-athletes and schools, never coaches or administrators.

You say that the headline is misleading‚Ä¶in what way? The author of this article clearly indicates that the issue is the culture and mentality that has become increasingly prevalent in college athletics. He also argues that the manner in which UL has conducted itself over the past decade plus does nothing but encourage that mentality. That‚Äôs a hard argument to refute. And no one is delighting in the fact that this horrible woman pimped out her daughters, or that grown men would condone and pay for such things‚Ä¶it‚Äôs sickening. What is entertaining is the irrational portion of your fan base(there are plenty of rational ones as well) that continues to somehow try to spin this situation or muddy the waters; or worse yet, continue to throw out ‚Äòthese are just allegations from an untrustworthy source‚Äô arguments. What is entertaining is that we joke about the lack of class, etc in the UL administration often, and now those jokes are being shown to, in fact, be true!

Then you rehire a football coach that basically took a dump on your program when he left and then had his own sex scandal where he lied to the police and the school. Arkansas then fired him. IMO, and everybody‚Äôs got one, it tells people that your school doesn‚Äôt care how you treat women and that culture has trickled down to the players. I agree with you that it is terrible that underage girls were involved. Louisville has made their bed and now that they will have to sleep in it.

If this happened anywhere on a college campus ‚Äì administration, academic departments, medical schools ‚Äì the entirety of the staff and faculty would be summarily dismissed. With no questions asked. \nThe only thing that makes this an issue is the money associated with the program and the overall winning percentage of Pitino. That is the very definition of win at all costs. \nYou admitted yourself that the whole thing is disturbing and disgusting. All you need to do now is take the other step and realize that there HAS to be a change in personnel or you will have (unwittingly) reinforced the behavior. That‚Äôs it. You either care about the morally-corrupt behaviors, the lives that were impacted and the illegal nature of what was going on in your athletic department or you don‚Äôt. There is no in-between.

GroundControlToNumber9 October 9, 2015 at 12:16   \nThis narrative is overkill and unsubstantiated‚Ä¶ \nNone of the women involved with the coaches previous decisions or players were put in dangerous situations from the details that have been presented.

It is dangerous for women when men in powerful positions (ie coaches who young men look up to) teach young men that women are nothing more than sex objects. Rick, Bobby, and even Jurich are men of power and have done nothing to show that they respect women, and have only done the opposite. It is extremely dangerous. Rape and abuse of women come from men who weren‚Äôt taught to respect women. It comes from men who were shown that women are nothing but objects for them to control. One women even lost her job at UofL for speaking out against that culture. But hey, it wasn‚Äôt your job so let‚Äôs just call it overkill for her to be upset about that.

But it was only a matter of time with the jurich/pitino/Petrino dream team that it all came crashing down. What‚Äôs astonishing is that they all come out publicly supporting one another immediately instead of looking into these issues and why they‚Äôre happening.
