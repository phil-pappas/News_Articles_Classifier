Tilton/Getty Images Matt Kenseth, driver of the #20 Dollar General Toyota, celebrates in Victory Lane after winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway on Sunday in Bristol, Tenn. Matt Kenseth outwardly continues to be among NASCAR's calmest drivers. But no one would blame him if his blood is up Sunday at Talladega.\nAdChoices Kenseth entered the Chase for the Sprint Cup race at Charlotte as the man to beat, but he crashed out of that race. That meant he needed to win at either Kansas or Talladega to advance to the Eliminator Round. You know what happened at Kansas.\nMORE: Chase-clinching scenarios | Qualifying Saturday, race Sunday | Confidence a rare commodity\nNo one knows what will happen at Talladega. NASCAR's most unpredictable track can be counted on to provide two things: a major crash that collects some of the best Cup drivers; and a winner.\nKenseth has won at Talladega, the superspeedway with its restrictor-plate requirements. Once, in 31 starts. That, as much as anything, lets Kenseth know how hard it is to win there. He does, however have a good record, with a driver rating of 89.2 that is second-best among active drivers and 10 finishes in the top 10.\nThere's a good argument floating through the ether about whether NASCAR should have Talladega in the Chase. After all, it and Daytona are the only tracks that require restrictor plates, devices that limit air intake and thus lower speeds. Plate racing brings cars into tighter groupings, and the downside of that is simple.\nWhen a car crashes, it takes several others out. The Big One , it's called. Talladega is notorious for crashes that collect a dozen or more cars and make no distinction between contender and bottom-dweller.\nKenseth needs to be a contender. So does Kyle Busch, who also is among the last four drivers in Chase points and ripe for elimination after Sunday. Also in the bottom four: Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Ryan Newman.\nMORE: Must-win race for Junior | He's favored to win | One shot at green-white-checkered finish\nJunior has great success at superspeedways and enters Sunday as the favorite to win. He won the May race at Talladega and the June race at Daytona. He and Jeff Gordon have won six times at Talladega.\nNo one is safe this Sunday, because there's no way to make it through Talladega without peril. Busch was in solid position to advance in last year's Chase but found himself wrecked at Talladega. End of Chase. It could happen to anyone, even the guys in the top eight.\nFor Kenseth, there is no change of plans for this week. “It’s the same,” he said. “There’s some things you can control and some things you can’t.”\nKenseth can control how he races against Joey Logano. It will come as a surprise if he gets even with Logano for their Kansas set-to, in which Logano tapped Kenseth's car late in the race en route to winning.\n\"He just chose to spin me out because he wanted to be in the top groove instead of going left and trying to race me for the win the way a man should do it, really,\" Kenseth said after the race. \"I definitely lost any respect I had for him before today, that's for sure.\"\nThere's also a good debate going on about Logano's actions. One person who had no trouble with it: NASCAR czar Brian France. Speaking on a SiriusXM racing show this week, France called Logano's nudge \"quintessential NASCAR.\"\n\"Late in the race, I think that's a great example of everybody doing probably exactly what they should be doing,\" France said. \"You had Matt Kenseth trying to block and hold his position. He had a faster car behind him, and when you block, you risk that somebody is going to be in that position . . . and there was contact.\n\"Logano made a very smart decision in what he did because not only did he try to win the race, which he said he wanted to do and obviously he did, but the idea to late in that race, to have an opportunity to put one of the top teams on the outside looking in to the next round in Matt Kenseth, (who) has run so well, that's a smart thing to do,\" France said.\nFrance might have channeled Vince McMahon, the pro wrestling promoter, in his statement. The Logano vs. Kenseth dynamic might not play out this weekend, but it will down the line.\nHere's what Kenseth said Friday when asked about Logano's comments after the Kansas race that he was just trying to fight for position.\n\"He's lying when he said he didn't do it on purpose because he lifted your tires off the ground offset to the left,\" Kenseth said. \"And he's too good a racecar driver to do that by accident.\"\nKenseth wasn't finished.\n\"Someday he might mature a little bit,\" he said. \"But first of all, he should have stopped running his mouth. . . . He drove the car into the wall himself twice.\n\"I don't know how you can possibly either block someone or put somebody in the wall when they're not up alongside you — you're pretty talented if you can do that when somebody's four feet behind you.\"\nIf Kenseth doesn't win at Talladega and is no longer in the Chase, he will make things interesting for Logano even if he doesn't go for payback in the final four races of the 2015 Cup season.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658968-nascar-sprint-cup-talladega-the-big-one-earnhardt-chase-advance-confidence", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658787-nascar-talladega-chase-sprint-cup-green-white-checkered-safety-injuries-crashes-wrecks", "http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/13955685/matt-kenseth-says-joey-logano-lying-not-turning-purpose", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658645-nascar-sprint-cup-talladega-campingworldcom-500-time-tv-channel-schedule-online-streaming-information-pole-qualifying-winner", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/article/4658851-nascar-odds-talladega-2015-vegas-favorites-betting-lines-dale-earnhardt-jr", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658647-nascar-sprint-cup-dale-earnhardt-jr-kansas-speedway-hollywood-casino-finish-standings", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658808-nascar-chase-clinching-scenarios-talladega-what-drivers-need-to-move-on-earnhardt", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658872-nascar-talladega-wrecks-big-one-earnhardt-schedule-tv-channel-fantasy-stats-kenseth-logano", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:48:31.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
