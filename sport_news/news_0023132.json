Gave us some momentum early and were able to kind of run away with it.” \nPatrick Mahomes threw for 428 yards and five touchdowns, two to Jakeem Grant, to lead Texas Tech to the Red Raiders’ first Big 12 win. \nGrant had a career-high 166 yards on nine catches. He caught touchdown passes of 75 and 37 yards for Texas Tech (4-2, 1-2). It was Grant’s third 100-plus-yard game this season. \nDeAndre Washington had a receiving and a rushing touchdown, while Justin Stockton scored on a 54-yard run. \nThe Red Raiders intercepted Cyclones quarterback Sam Richardson three times — two by J.J. Gaines — and Texas Tech scored touchdowns off two of them. \nRedshirt freshman Mike Warren had his third straight game of more than 100 yards for the Cyclones (2-3, 1-1), finishing with a career-high 245 yards on 23 carries. Warren said hopes to continue to contribute as he did Saturday \n“If they set the bar high, it’s up to me to reach that, and I feel like this game truly showed that we as an offense, we can run the ball,” he said. “We’ve just got to keep going up from there.” \nIowa State quarterback Sam Richardson completed 10 of 21 for 139 yards and the three interceptions. He had three coming into the game. \nJoshua Thomas scored two rushing touchdowns for the Cyclones, each from a yard out. \nTexas Tech’s 776 total yards was a school record. \nIowa State coach Paul Rhoads said Texas Tech’s fast offense was relentless. \n“A lot of things were pivotal, starting out with the interception early that didn’t allow us to have a fast start and then several scrambles that, when it comes down to it, there’s not much excuse for,” he said. \nMahomes completed 33 of 46 passes with no interceptions. He was sacked for only the second time this season when he was called for intentional grounding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:36:08.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
