White scored three touchdowns and passed for a fourth, but the Owls’ offensive success couldn’t match that of the Flames, who used their passing attack to pull away from Kennesaw State. The News & Advance - Autumn Parry slideshow LYNCHBURG, Va. — As Brian Bohannon continues to build the football team at Kennesaw State, the most important tool he’ll have to keep the Owls moving forward are additional scholarships.The program does not have a full complement of scholarships available in its inaugural season, so there will understandably be growing pains when the Owls face the powers of the Big South Conference.Take for instance Saturday’s contest against Liberty. The Owls were beaten several times in the passing game and the defense’s lack of depth was exploited as the Flames’ running game found its footing.But the Owls kept plugging away on offense, and showed some life in the final minutes. The end result was a 45-35 setback before 20,393 fans at Williams Stadium, a contest that featured a Liberty team that opened the season ranked in both FCS top-25 polls with a roster loaded to the brim with scholarship players, and a Kennesaw State squad that is about two or three years shy of having a full roster of scholarship players.“I’m proud of the way our guys fought (Saturday),” Bohannon said. “You’re talking about a team coming in with half the number of scholarships, and our guys went toe-to-toe and fought pretty hard. There’s no quit in our football team.”Liberty (4-4, 1-2 Big South) ended its two-game losing streak by scoring a season-high 45 points, which also marked the most points allowed by Kennesaw State (5-2, 1-1) this season.Liberty senior quarterback Josh Woodrum, whose sound clip of guaranteeing the Flames would win their final four games of the season riled up some of the Owls’ players, dissected the secondary almost at ease.Woodrum completed 15 of 21 passes for 230 yards and four touchdowns. He threw three touchdown passes in the first half, all to Darrin Peterson, as the Flames built a 24-7 lead.Kennesaw State also helped keep Liberty drives alive by making uncharacteristic mistakes. The Owls were called for being offsides eight times, twice for unsportsmanlike conduct and once for a chop block on two different players on the same play.“We beat ourself a lot (Saturday),” Bohannon said. “I give Liberty a lot of credit. They’re a good football team, but, shoot, we had 11 penalties for over 100 yards. You’re not going to beat the defending Big South champion with 11 penalties. We’ve got to do a better job of that.”Kennesaw State quarterback Trey White rushed for three touchdowns on 29 attempts and added a touchdown pass to his backup, Jake McKenzie. McKenzie, who was in as a running back, spelled White at QB later in the game passed for a touchdown to Xavier Harper.Trey Chivers rushed for a game-high 97 yards on 14 carries.The Owls did not open the game as if they were intimidated by the rowdy crowd, engineering a 12-play, 76-yard drive that was capped by White’s 1-yard touchdown run to take a 7-0 lead less than 9 minutes into the contest.It was the sixth time in seven games that Kennesaw State scored on its opening possession.That score seemed to spark something in Liberty, which had not trailed at home until that touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:15:20.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
