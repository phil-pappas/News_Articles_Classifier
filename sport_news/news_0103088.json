At the moment, there is still enough space for people to get enrolled and get involved in the course.'' \nThe course, at Otago Softball's headquarters on Frasers Rd, will run from 4.30pm to 8.30pm on Friday, and 9am to 4.15pm on Sunday. \nPeople interested in registering can contact Coutts at osainc@vodafone.co.nz .
