And he’s not the only one. \nKaepernick threw his fifth interception in two games, took six more sacks and watched Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers pull off the big plays for a team San Francisco’s quarterback used to dominate in the 49ers’ latest ugly loss, 17-3 to the unbeaten Packers on Sunday. \n“We have to be able to get the ball out quicker to get it into playmakers’ hands,” Kaepernick said. \nSan Francisco (1-3), off to its worst start since 2010, has been limited to 28 total points over three games while giving up 107. \nThe frustration is clearly mounting. It showed from wideouts Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith. \n“I don’t want to be rude, but I’ve got nothing to say,” Boldin said to the large swarm of reporters at his locker. \nThere’s little to celebrate in any phase. Rookie punter Bradley Pinion even took venom from the home crowd as the 49ers had their four-game winning streak against Green Bay (4-0) snapped in the teams’ fifth matchup since 2012, including two playoff wins. \nKaepernick, who had played some of his best games against the Packers, went 13 for 25 for 160 yards and a 55.4 passer rating. Carlos Hyde was held to 20 yards on eight carries.
