Running back Elijah Hood confirmed that the players were tired of hearing such things, too. “We were hearing a lot about Wake’s defense, so we had to see for ourselves what we were up against. The results speak,” Hood said. North Carolina’s 50-14 blowout of Wake Forest in an Atlantic Coast Conference matchup Saturday night at Kenan Stadium certainly spoke volumes. “A lot of coaches said they were tired of hearing about Wake Forest’s defense, they were tired about hearing about Wake Forest. The thing is, we came out and wanted to jump on them,” Williams said. North Carolina (5-1 overall, 2-0 ACC) didn’t get exactly what it wanted, needing to overcome another sluggish start. Williams was picked off on his second and third throws, which helped Wake Forest (3-4, 1-3) to the first points of the game on John Wolford’s 1-yard pass to Cam Serigne. North Carolina’s senior quarterback absorbed responsibility for those early turnovers, then proceeded to complete 14 of 20 passes for 282 yards and three touchdowns, while adding 59 yards and another touchdown on the ground. The onslaught started on the first play of the second quarter, when Williams uncorked a high-arching 57-yard bomb to Mack Hollins for a touchdown. Hollins caught all of Williams’ touchdown passes, finishing with 103 yards on those three catches. “We knew going into the game they were going to create some issues for us with as much blitzing as they did,” North Carolina coach Larry Fedora said. “Our guys are playing well right now, they’re playing well as a team. Our chemistry, the love that they have for each other … it’s fun to coach this team.” Wake Forest’s Tyler Bell lost a fumble on the next offensive play. Five plays later, Williams ran into the end zone for a 13-yard touchdown. Hood took over for the Tar Heels’ next touchdown, taking 21 seconds and mixing his blend of speed and power on runs of 29 and 36 yards, with the longer run resulting in a touchdown. “The O-line just gave me the hole. I mean, they took out the linebacker, I was able to bounce it, get to the second level,” said Hood, who needed just eight carries to reach 101 yards. “Once I get to the second level, their safeties didn’t look like they wanted to come down on me too much. Make one guy miss and you usually get to the end zone.” Page 2 of 2 - Wake Forest answered with a 12-play, 75-yard drive that swallowed five minutes of the clock. The Tar Heels’ retort was accelerated by a 61-yard catch-and-run by Austin Proehl — the sophomore freed up to sprint down the sideline because of a block by Quinshad Davis. T.J. Logan capped that drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, his first score of the season. Twenty-nine points in the second quarter, all on drives that didn’t take more than two minutes. “I’ve always got total confidence in the offense,” sophomore defensive end Dajuan Drennon said. “I always know that … because I’m so used to them starting slow, I’m just like, ‘OK, well it’s just going to come to a point where it’s all going to click.’” The pace slowed temporarily in the second half, with an empty Tar Heels possession sandwiched by two nine-play drives that didn’t net points by the Demon Deacons. The strangest play — and the one that caused the most angst among this crowd — came after Ryan Switzer fielded a punt in between three Demon Deacons in the third quarter. Switzer was bumped as soon he caught the ball, then recorded a 70-yard return to Wake Forest’s 1-yard line. Switzer’s return was called back because officials determined he called for a fair catch. “Referee said he saw a fair catch, so that’s what it was. What are you going to say?” Fedora said. When North Carolina rattled off another three straight touchdowns at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth, this rout was complete. “We definitely know that we’re going to put up points. We have a lot of confidence in what we do, in coaching staff and their game plan. We expect to score,” Hood said. As backup quarterback Mitch Trubisky rumbled in for a 10-yard touchdown with 11:11 left, it capped a stretch in which North Carolina scored touchdowns on seven of nine possessions. The longest of those possessions took seven plays against what entered as a stout Wake Forest defense. “We take adversity as a good thing. We almost seem like we want to put ourselves in adversity just to prove that we can get out of it,” Drennon said. “Which is kind of weird, but it’s just kind of what happens.” ■ EXTRA POINTS …: Eastern Alamance junior offensive lineman Jonah Melton verbally committed to North Carolina before the game. Melton, who’s 6-foot-4, 290 pounds, is in his second season as the Eagles’ left tackle. … John Ferranto started at left tackle for the Tar Heels. Bentley Spain, who has started there three times this season, didn’t play because of an injury. … Hollins became the first North Carolina player with three receiving touchdowns in a game since ex-Cummings High School star Dwight Jones had three against Duke in 2011. … Western Alamance graduate and North Carolina freshman walk-on Hunter Lent punted three times for 45, 56 and 49 yards. None of those was returned, keeping the Tar Heels’ pristine mark of zero punt returns against this season.
