With that move, Mudiay, the seventh pick in this year's NBA draft, was thrust into a starting role for Denver. \n\"Ty's a great player,\" Mudiay said. \"But for the organization to show confidence to bring me in is more of a confidence builder for me.\" \nMudiay is only 19, but he isn't the typical teenage rookie.

(AP) After being denied eligibility to play at SMU by the NCAA, Mudiay played in China last season. He averaged 18 points, 5.9 assists and 6.3 rebounds in 12 games with Guangdong while playing against several former NBA players, including Stephon Marbury. Mudiay has also averaged 15 points, 5.4 assists and 4.8 turnovers in five preseason games starting for the Nuggets.\n\"The last two years have been rocky for [the Nuggets],\" Mudiay said. \"But I'm going to just come in here and do the best I can to change that. I'm trying to win. When you win, everything is definitely better. \n\"Being a rookie, being a high pick, you're kind of thrown into a situation where you have to develop. The team will develop as well.\" \nNuggets forward Kenneth Faried likes what he sees overall from Mudiay so far. \n[ Yahoo Fantasy Basketball: Sign up for a league today ] \n\"From the first two games to now, he has really progressed as a point guard,\" Faried said. \"He had turnovers the first two preseason games, but now he's confident. We're telling him to stay confident and stay on attack mode and he's doing just that.\" \nMudiay has also sought advice from Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry . Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony , who previously starred for the Nuggets, gave Mudiay advice about the NBA and living in Denver. Mudiay has also spent time talking to former Nuggets guard Chauncey Billups in Denver. \n[STACK: How Dwight Howard and six other NBA players improved their game ] \n\"If you really want to be on that level, you really need to seek out who is out there and who has done it,\" Mudiay said. \nOne NBA scout told Yahoo Sports he expects Mudiay to initially struggle, but he could grow into a star. The Nuggets have never had an NBA Rookie of the Year. \n\"From what I've seen, he's turnover prone in traffic,\" the NBA scout said. \"With him having the keys to the car, they're going to have to deal with his mistakes. He needs to improve his shot, but it's not broken where he won't be able to shoot. When he really learns how to play and the other guys learn how to play with him, he could be special.\" \nMudiay believes the 2015 NBA rookie class will be \"one of the best classes in a long time.\" Here's nine other rookies worth watching this season: \nKarl-Anthony Towns , Minnesota Timberwolves , F/C, No. 1 overall pick Scout's view: \"I like him. He's going to do well. I love his ability to shoot the ball [and] pass, and he learns. He has a high basketball IQ. He's not on a good team, but he will play well for them.\" \nJahlil Okafor , Philadelphia 76ers , C, No. 3 pick Scout's view: \"He's super talented. He is a low-post scorer. But long-term his body kind of scares me. Will he be able to hold weight off?\" View gallery", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:46:04.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
