Manuel Pellegrini's side is level on 22 points with Arsenal but has a superior goal difference. United stays fourth on 20 points. \n\"We created more chances but didn't finish them and that's disappointing,\" United manager Louis van Gaal said. \"You need to win these games for the fans.\" \nPellegrini was happy his side avoided defeat but not pleased with his team's defensive performance. \n\"I am satisfied with a point but I don't like to play in this way,\" Pellegrini said. \"It's important to have a point here, another point in the table, but I don't think it's the way the team must play. \n\"If you can't win it, then don't lose it by not concentrating.\" \nIn Sunday's late match, Liverpool was denied victory by a late Southampton goal in manager Juergen Klopp's first Premier League game at Anfield. \nSubstitute Christian Benteke headed Liverpool into the lead with a towering effort in the 78th minute, but Mane bundled in an equalizer four minutes from the end, before being sent off in stoppage time for his second booking. \n\"We knew it would be hard work today, three days after the last game, but we didn't create enough chances,\" Klopp said. \"We had our moments and played very good, but in the end, you have to score.\" \nKlopp wants Liverpool to play with more composure in their coming matches. \n\"We have to be more calm in the situations we create,\" Klopp said. \"They (the players) are strong, they are skilled but we are not cool. That is the problem.\" \nLiverpool is ninth on 14 points, with Southampton a place higher on the same total with a higher goal difference. \nHarry Kane scored a hat trick as Tottenham came from behind to thrash Bournemouth 5-1. \nMatt Ritchie put Bournemouth ahead after only 49 seconds before Kane levelled with a penalty. Mousa Dembele and Erik Lamela scored to put Tottenham comfortably ahead at halftime, before Kane completed his treble. \nSunderland got its first win of the season with a 3-0 victory against northeastern England rival Newcastle at the Stadium of Light. \nNewcastle was the strongest team in the opening stages but its performance was derailed when captain Fabricio Coloccini conceded a penalty on the stroke of halftime and was shown a red card after blocking a run in the penalty area from Steven Fletcher. \nAdam Johnson converted the spot kick, before Billy Jones and Fletcher also scored. \nThe win moved Sunderland off the bottom of the table and into 18th in the league on six points, above Newcastle. \nAston Villa drops to last on the day it fired manager Tim Sherwood. Villa has lost its last six league games and has not won since the first day of the season at Bournemouth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:40:00.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
