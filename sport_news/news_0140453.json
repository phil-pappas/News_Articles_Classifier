The Roughriders are 2-14 for the first time since 1980, when the CFL’s regular season consisted of 16 games per team. Saskatchewan also went 2-14 in 1979. \nThe Roughriders assumed a 21-3 lead on Saturday before the Eskimos stormed back with 32 consecutive points en route to improving their record to 13-4. \nSaskatchewan opened the scoring at 3:14 of the first quarter when Rob Bagg, a receiver by trade, scored on a two-yard run. Tyler Crapigna’s first CFL point — a convert — gave Saskatchewan a 7-0 lead. \nEdmonton’s Sean Whyte responded with a 37-yard field goal at 6:21 of the opening frame to reduce the Roughriders’ lead to 7-3. \nSaskatchewan answered emphatically when Brett Smith threw a quick slant to Ryan Smith, who took it the rest of the way for a 65-yard TD at 8:15 of the first quarter. Crapigna’s convert made it 14-3. \nThe Roughriders fattened their lead to 21-3 when Keith Price — taking his first snap in the CFL — threw a 29-yard TD pass to Naaman Roosevelt and Crapigna converted. \nThe Eskimos responded with 21 consecutive second-quarter points — with Whyte converting Reilly’s five-yard TD run (at 3:29), his 50-yard TD pass to Adarius Bowman (13:22) and his nine-yard scoring pass to Derel Walker (14:43). The outburst gave Edmonton a 24-21 halftime lead. \nWhyte opened the second-half scoring with a 37-yard field goal at 4:14 of the third quarter, giving his team a 27-21 lead. \nEdmonton went ahead 35-21 when Reilly hit Cory Watson for a 12-yard TD pass and then ran for a two-point conversion just over a minute into the fourth quarter. \nCrapigna’s 22-yard field goal, at 7:28 of the fourth quarter, reduced Edmonton’s lead to 35-24. \nBrett Smith finished with 11 completions in 15 attempts for 191 yards, with one touchdown and no interceptions. Price was 7-for-9 for 84 yards, with a TD and no picks. \nAnthony Allen led the Riders in rushing, with nine carries for 68 yards. Roosevelt paced Saskatchewan’s receivers with five catches for 101 yards. \nBowman had a monster game for Edmonton, catching 12 passes for 208 yards. \nReilly was 29-for-39 for 377 yards, with three TDs and an interception, while helping Edmonton amass 31 first downs. The Riders had 20 first downs. \nThe paid attendance was 30,488, although empty seats were conspicuous throughout the stadium. \nThe Roughriders will complete the regular-season with back-to-back road games — Oct. 31 against the Calgary Stampeders and Nov. 8 versus the Montreal Alouettes. \nNOTES: Linebacker Jeff Knox Jr., reached the 100-tackle mark, becoming the first Roughrider to hit that milestone since Jerrell Freeman in 2011 ... Knox was also named the Riders’ Wireless Age player-of-the-year, as chosen by the fans ... Defensive back Terrell Maze was honoured for his community involvement. © Copyright (c) The Regina Leader-Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:27:24.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
