Twitter Email Posted: Sat Oct. 17, 2015 \nHaving climbed out of an 0–2 hole to win their best-of-five Division Series against the Rangers , the Blue Jays are unlikely to be troubled by having dropped the first game of the best-of-seven American League Championship Series on Friday night. Losing Game 2 would be another matter entirely. Of the 75 teams to fall behind 0–2 in a best-of-seven series in major league history, just 13 (17%) rallied to win the series. That in addition to the manner in which they lost Game 1, being shut out for just the sixth time in their 168 games this season, and the possibility that they may have lost a key hitter in Edwin Encarnacion , make Game 2 an already crucial contest for Toronto. \nBlue Jays at Royals Series: ALCS Game 2, Royals lead 1-0 Start Time: 3:30 p.m. ET TV: FOX Sports 1 \n• VERDUCCI: Man with a Plan: Edinson Volquez dominants in ALCS Game 1 \n• Despite the offense’s poor showing in Game 1, the biggest question mark for the Blue Jays heading into Game 2 is what they will get out of rental ace David Price. Price was outstanding in his first 10 starts for Toronto after being acquired from the Tigers at the non-waiver trading deadline, emerging as the principal rival to Houston’s Dallas Keuchel for this year’s American League Cy Young award by going 8–1 with a 1.95 ERA and 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings down the stretch. However, his last start of the regular season was a stinker (five runs, four earned, in five innings against the Rays ), prompting the Blue Jays to skip his final regular season turn. He then struggled in his lone Division Series start , giving up five runs in seven innings, hitting two batters and giving up two home runs, and when called upon to pitch in relief in Game 4 on three-day’s rest, again proved ineffective , giving up three runs in three innings. Add that all up and Price has allowed 12 earned runs in 15 innings over his last three appearances, which works out to a 7.20 ERA. He has now made six postseason starts in his career, only half of which were quality, and thanks to poor run support, he has gone 0–6 in those starts. Working on full rest after throwing 50 pitches in relief, Price has a lot to prove in this game, which could wind up being his last start for Toronto before he hits free agency next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:06:27.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
