The senior-laden lineup pulled together at crunch time for its fifth win in its last six matches, handing Apponequet its fourth straight loss, 3-0, Wednesday night. “It’s not just out of luck that this team has come together after three years,” Old Rochester coach Matt Bisso explained. “They put the time in and play in the off-season and go to summer camps. It’s no surprise we’re playing well.” Old Rochester won by scores of 25-16, 25-21 and 25-23. On the other side of the floor, Apponequet puts out a roster of almost all juniors, most of whom are playing their first season on the varsity. The Lakers graduated five rotation starters from a year ago and have been dealing with injuries on top of that almost new roster. Libero Kendelle Carboni just returned from missing two weeks, Abigayle Litos has just been cleared to return to the team today and Sarah Milligan watched while on crutches. Hayli Marshall led the Bulldogs with nine kills and four aces, ending the third set with her final kill. Old Rochester seemed headed for an easy sweep, pulling out to an 8-2 lead in the third set, but Apponequet battled back to 23-22 and 24-23 in trying for force a fourth set. Senior setter Michaelah Nunes had 14 assists, but put her teammates in position to score points. “We play bigger than what we are height-wise and it’s about getting offensive on the attack right away,” Bisso said. “We want to force the ball instead of playing defensively. Tonight, we had our offense clicking all around. “Michaelah was setting on point and the hitters had time to play their game. Accuracy from the setter is super important. If we can’t get the ball set to the hitters where they want it, we can’t be on the attack.” Apponequet coach Jen Longo saw what Old Rochester was doing and doing it well. “They were more aggressive than we were tonight,” she said. “We’re a young team and are still working on skills rather than strategy. “We played nervous, tried to play it safe and made mistakes because of that. We have to play with more confidence.” WHAT IT MEANS: Old Rochester is right in the middle of the South Coast Conference with a 4-3 league record and 6-3 overall mark. Apponequet is now 1-6 in the SCC and 3-6 overall with non-league victories over Westport and Bishop Stang. BISSO: “We’re a competitive team and if we play our best, we can compete with anyone. We went five sets with Bourne and four with Fairhaven and Voc-Tech. Every night, any team can beat anyone in the conference. We showed fight against the teams we lost to the first time. Next time we play them, we feel we can beat them.” LONGO: “Kendelle (Carboni) has been out for two weeks and just came back. She is a phenomenal passer, but we have to adjust to that now. … In the second half (of the season), we’ve seen these teams once so we will know where to block and where to play and not have to wait until the first game. We can work on it in practice.” OLD ROCHESTER STATS: Zoe Smith had two blocks and Haley Aguiar had 10 digs.
