No other major national sports hall of fame museum is built into a stadium. \nEstablished in 1950 and long located in Oneonta, New York, the Hall announced its closing in January 2010. The archives have been stored since then. \nThe North Texas stadium was built by the late Lamar Hunt, a 1982 inductee into the National Soccer Hall of Fame and one of only three individual recipients of its Medal of Honor.
