Terry doesn't get a lot of chances to touch the football. \nVan Neils is the workhorse running back, and Rob Meidl is a dual-threat at quarterback. Brock Annexstad gets his catches and touchdowns. \nSo where does Terry, the junior running back, fit in? \n\"We'd like C.J. to get 12, 15 touches per game,\" West coach Mark Esch said. \"He's a guy who can break one.\" \nTerry scored three touchdowns as the Scarlets defeated Winona 42-19 to win the Big Southeast District, Blue Division championship Friday at Paul Giel Field. It capped a perfect regular season and set up another promising postseason. \n\"We knew this was going to be one of the better teams we've faced this season,\" Terry said. \"But now we have a perfect season so far, and we can use this momentum to carry us in the playoffs.\" \nWest, which is rated No. 1 in Class , scored on its second possession, moving 60 yards on six plays. The touchdown came when Rob Meidl floated a 44-yard pass to Terry, who ran under the football and into the end zone. Tyler Defor added the PAT. \n\"We don't rep many passes where you catch it over your shoulder,\" Terry said. \"I thought I was going to drop it, but I caught it and scored so I was pretty happy.\" \nThe Scarlets made it 14-0 on the next drive. Zachary Jakes blocked a punt, giving West the ball at Winona's 17. Three plays later, Meidl pump-faked to Brock Annexstad, whose double move left him open in the corner of the end zone for the 13-yard score. \nWinona, rated No. 7 in Class AAAA, got on the board in the second quarter. After stopping West on fourth-and-6 at the Winona 49, Winona used nine plays to score on a 9-yard pass to make it 14-7. \nThe Scarlets answered quickly, starting at their own 41. Meidl had four runs of the six plays, capping the drive with a 2-yard scoring run to restore the two-touchdown lead. \nWinona scored with 21 seconds remaining in the first half, but the PAT was blocked, leaving West up 21-13 at the break. Meidl had 53 yards rushing and 107 yards passing in the first half. \nBut Terry had just two touches, the long pass and a short run. \n\"We wanted to get him the ball, but they were taking away the edge,\" Esch said. \"Once we found a gap where we could cut it up, that became a very good play for us.\" \nWest had a 6-minute, 11-play drive to open the second half, with Terry scoring on a 9-yard run. \nWinona (7-1) answered, connecting on two long passes, but another missed conversion cut the lead to only 28-19. \nThe next score came on another fourth-down conversion, a 32-yard pass from Meidl to Annexstad, and Van Neils punched it in on the next play for the clinching score at 42-19 with 3:50 to play. \n\"Our fourth-down philosophy is if we're past (our own) 40, we're going to go for it,\" Esch said. \"It's worked pretty well for us, and I have a lot of confidence in our defense.\" \nThe Scarlets ended up with 375 yards of offense, with 228 yards rushing. In the second half, West rushed for 140 yards and threw only six passes. \nMeidl had 94 yards rushing, and Neils had 90. Terry ended up with 44 yards but scored the touchdowns. \n\"To be honest, I really don't care if I get 10 touches or just one touch,\" Terry said. \"As long as we get the win, I'm happy. \n\"The offensive line really played well. We don't give those guys enough credit.\" \nWest (8-0) will be the No. 1 seed in the Section 2 playoffs and have a bye in Wednesday's opening round. \nFollow Chad Courrier on Twitter @ChadCourrier Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:33:18.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
