The two teams are among the most successful in DR Congo and in 1984, a match between the two sides lasted just three minutes before fan disturbances took hold.\nThis year, chaos erupted when Motema Pembe took the lead, which prompted multiple fan invasions from both teams. According to reports, up to 45 people were injured the violence but there were no fatalities.\nLast year, 14 people died during a stampede at a football match in Kinshasa.\nThis 50-year-old rivalry makes El Clasico look friendly.\n[via 101 Great Goals ]", "external_links": ["http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/crazy-crowd-violence-erupts-at-the-kinshasa-derby-in-dr-congo-video/"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:21:00.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
