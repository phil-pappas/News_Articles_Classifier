As far as triumphant homecomings go … nah, this doesn’t have the looks of one at first glance.\nAs a Wisconsin Badger Gordon rolled up copious numbers of yards (4,915 in three-plus seasons) and touchdowns (49). As a Charger he has done neither in his first five games as a professional, going into Sunday’s game at Green Bay.\nThere have been glimpses, through these first five weeks, of the skills that convinced Tom Telesco to trade up two spots to pick him 15th overall last April.\nBut the numbers don’t lie, and they aren’t pretty. He has 270 yards in 71 carries, a 3.8 average, and has yet to score an NFL touchdown.\nHe has had one game statistically worthy of a No. 15 pick, 88 yards in 16 carries in Week 2 in Cincinnati; otherwise, he hasn’t had more than 51 rushing yards in a game and has had 38 and 42 the last two weeks. He has lost two fumbles in five games, including one Monday night against Pittsburgh on the Chargers’ first possession of the second half.\nAnd did we say he hasn’t scored a touchdown yet?\nGordon normally comes out to the podium during the news conference portion of Wednesdays at Chargers Park. Curiously – or maybe understandably, given the circumstances — he did not meet the media outside Wednesday, nor was he available during the open locker room period.\nReally, what can he say?\n“Play harder … just play harder for your teammates and plays will happen,” he said Monday night after the 24-20 loss to Pittsburgh. That’s fairly typical of Gordon, a solid young man who certainly hasn’t displayed any sense of entitlement in the early weeks of his career.\nHe’s certainly not going to say his problems are anyone else’s fault. But the utter chaos that has enveloped the Chargers’ injury-riddled offensive line has to have influenced Gordon’s effectiveness.\nWednesday’s scorecard, on the first day of preparation for the Packers: King Dunlap (concussion), Chris Hairston (ankle) and Chris Watt (concussion, groin injury) did not practice. D.J. Fluker (ankle) and Orlando Franklin (ankle) were limited participants.\nFranklin hasn’t played since Week 3 in Minnesota. If he is within range of returning – and it might still be a couple of weeks away, as a guesstimate – that’s the best news the O-line has had in a good, long while.\nMeanwhile, they could again have a front five of Kenny Wiggins, J.D. Walton, Trevor Robinson, Fluker and Joe Barksdale, with Tyreek Burwell the only reserve. Or there could be a late week roster move; guards Craig Watts and Michael Ola are currently on the Chargers’ practice squad.\nIn any event, Gordon’s struggles behind an embattled offensive line have unwittingly backed up a theme Coach Mike McCoy began promoting shortly after Week 1 whenever he was asked about Gordon.\n“It will take 11 guys doing their jobs better,” McCoy has consistently responded.\nAt first it sounded like typical CoachSpeak, a team-first narrative designed to keep the rookie humble. But the more the guys up front struggle, and the more Gordon consequently struggles, the more credibility McCoy has.\n“You look at one of the stretch plays we ran late in the (Steelers) game, the way we ran it, the way we blocked it up front, the way Melvin had patience hitting the crease,” McCoy said Wednesday. “There’s been plenty of good and bad in every game.\n“He’s a special player. But like I said, it’s got to be all 11. It’s not just one guy.”\n(Does that mean Philip Rivers needs to block, too, or just hand the ball off quicker?)\nGordon is a Wisconsin guy through and through, a high school star in Kenosha and a college star in Madison. Each city is about 21/2 hours driving time from Green Bay, and as devoted as Packers fans are, there might be a few No. 28 Chargers jerseys spotted in the stands at Lambeau Field Sunday.\nWill it help? The 5-0 Packers are noted for their pass rush (20 sacks this season, 16 of them in the last three games), and are seventh in the league in team defense. But they are 28th in the league in rushing defense with 130.2 yards allowed per game, one spot and 2.2 yards ahead of San Diego in the league-wide stats.\nSo maybe there’s a chance for Gordon to have a productive homecoming, after all.\nContact the writer: jalexander@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:33:53.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
