(Photo: Sue Ogrocki, AP)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE NBA superstar Kevin Durant has aspirations of owning an NFL team.\nThat is, once his hall of fame career is finished, of course.\nIn a recent interview on ESPN's Fantasy Focus podcast, Durant told Matthew Berry and Field Yates of his future plans of NFL ownership.\n\"My first priority would be the Washington Redskins, even if it was just a small percentage,\" Durant said. \"I just want to get involved. Growing up five minutes away from the stadium and always being a fan, I have a Redskins tattoo on my forearm. So I feel part of the team so much, so to be an owner and all the way entrenched with the team would be cool.\"\nWait, doesn't Washington also have an NBA team? Isn't Durant a free agent at the end of the upcoming season?\nOnce free agency rolls around, the 2014 MVP will inevitably draw interest from every NBA team. Where he decides to take his talents, however, depends primarily on the results that the Oklahoma City Thunder experience (or don't experience) this year.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Surprise teams and David West interview\nIf Durant and point guard Russell Westbrook aren't able to share the basketball and lead the Thunder back to the elite status that they once held, Wizards fans dreams could quite possibly become a reality.\nLiving in D.C., he could kill two birds with one stone and get a head start on his ownership dreams, too.\nBut, if Westbrook and Durant can coexist and establish their dominance while also staying healthy, Oklahoma City may as well hang the No. 35 jersey in its rafters now. Only time will tell.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN ", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f94ab8ff2f6d0fac88feb7126689b003ac231f4/c=759-0-3643-2884/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804135226754727-AP-NBA-Player-Stabbed.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RMOthc&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RMOthc&text=Kevin%20Durant%20wants%20to%20own%20Redskins&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b9d69a17e8cded0df6f0e4067be1a7fab395546/r=500x345/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635806001804300241-AP-Mavericks-Thunder-Basketball.jpg", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225252899&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a4931d1311650f7c1378c82beb2f14d5801a258/c=0-66-2077-1627&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635806001804300241-AP-Mavericks-Thunder-Basketball.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635806001804300241-AP-Mavericks-Thunder-Basketball.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:06:25.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
