The combination were victorious at Luhmuhlen in 2014, and second at the Kentucky Three Day Event earlier this year. Libby Law \nTim Price and Wesko, seen here at Aachen in August, are tipped as co-favourites for victory in Pau \nPundits are picking that Pau will be a repeat of that event - a showdown between Price and reigning Olympic and European champion, Germany's Michael Jung. Price and Wesko lead the first two phases at Kentucky, but were pipped in the final show jumping phase by Jung and his mare FischerRocana FST. \nJonelle, meanwhile, is still chasing her first four-star win, despite the consistent form that has seen her ranked as high as number two in the world. She will be riding her stable star, the spunky little mare Faerie Dianimo, on whom she was fourth at Pau last year. \n\"This is a world-class horse who has been going from strength to strength. If we can keep building on that, then surely it is a matter of time for that win to come,\" she says. Also for New Zealand, Sir Mark Todd is entered on his London Olympic horse NZB Campino, who is one of his main hopes for Rio. Libby Law \nSir Mark Todd and NZB Campino are among the big names jostling for Olympic selection \nFormer World and Olympic Champion Blyth Tait lines up with Bear Necessity V; Tait is keen to build on his recent success at Boekelo where he was second in the CCI3* on Xanthus III. He's made no secret of his desire to get a \"decent\" four star result with Rio certainly in his mind. \nThe other New Zealand riders entered are Jock Paget on Clifton Signature, Lucy Jackson on Bosun, and Dan Jocelyn on Phoenix L. Tim Price has a second ride in Lord of the Owls, in the horse's four-star debut. \nFifty-six horses have entered the CCI4* class, representing 11 nations including Australia, Germany, Great Britain and the USA. The dressage phase starts on Thursday night (NZ time) and runs for two days, followed by the cross country and the show jumping. Libby Law \nBlyth Tait and Bear Necessity V; seeking a strong four-star finish at Pau \nWhile Pau is the end of the 2015 season, it also marks the start of the FEI Classics Series for 2015-2016, which encompasses the world's six CCI4* events â€“ Pau, Adelaide, Kentucky, Badminton, Luhmuhlen and Burghley. The winner of the series scored a $US40,000 bonus. Andrew Nicholson is New Zealand's only previous winner of the series. \nFor more information, see www.event-pau.com \nFor more like this, see NZ Horse & Pony magazine, new issue out now - NZ Horse & Pony", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:38:04.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
