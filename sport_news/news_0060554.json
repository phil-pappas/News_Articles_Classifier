And, given Arizona’s defensive struggles, that could spell disaster.\nHere are things you should know about the Cougars, and why the Wildcats could be in trouble:\nThe Cougars can wing it. Washington State averages 398.5 passing yards per game, the most in the Pac-12 and fourth-most in the country. And for all the talk about Cal’s Jared Goff, it’s Wazzu’s Luke Falk who leads the league in passing yards per game (395.2), attempts (325) and completions (235).\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats XTRA app: Get latest news, scores\nIt’s a nightmare because … UA, despite playing run-first Stanford and the balanced UCLA, Oregon State and Colorado, ranks ninth in the league in passing defense. The Wildcats are allowing 7.4 yards per pass attempt, the second-worst total (behind Arizona State) in the Pac-12. The best way to disrupt a pass-happy team is to rush the quarterback, but Arizona hasn’t been very good at that, either: The Wildcats have just 13 sacks through seven games, and rank 76th nationally with 1.86 sacks per game.\n“We need to get as much pressure as we can, even if it’s not a sack,” UA defensive tackle Luca Bruno said.\nStill, a takedown or two would be nice. Consider: Jack Banda leads the team with two sacks — and he didn’t play a meaningful snap before last week.\n“We got a little lift from him,” Rodriguez said. “Everybody was probably saying, 'Jack who?' ”\nThey’re experienced: Each of Washington State’s 11 offensive starters has been in the system for three years or longer. Falk and starting running back Gerard Wicks are two of the team’s four starting redshirt sophomores. Standout receiver Gabe Marks is a redshirt junior, and left tackle Joe Dahl and left guard Gunnar Eklund are fifth-year seniors.\nAZCENTRAL\nPac-12 football power rankings - Week 8\nMarks and fellow receiver River Cracraft rank first and sixth in the Pac-12, respectively, in catches per game.\n“They have as good skill players as maybe anybody in our league,” Rodriguez said.\nIt’s a nightmare because … While Arizona has some on-paper experience on defense, the numbers are misleading. Take the two starting cornerbacks: Cam Denson is a sophomore, while Da’Vonte Neal is a junior converted receiver. Backups Jarvis McCall (redshirt sophomore), Sammy Morrison (true freshman) and Jace Whittaker (true freshman) lack big-game — heck, any game — experience.\nArizona’s inexperience, coupled with the Wildcats’ pass-rush problems, presents defensive coordinator Jeff Casteel with an impossible choice. Blitz the quarterback, and Arizona runs the risk of leaving the young DBs exposed. Sit back, and Falk will have as much time as he needs to throw.\n“The young guys have to grow up in a hurry,” Rodriguez said. “We’ve got to play with more confidence at every position.”\nWazzu’s beaten Arizona before: The Cougars’ upset win in Tucson two years ago might have been the low point of the Rodriguez era, in part because the Wildcats’ performance was so out of character. Quarterback Connor Halliday led WSU to a 420-yard, 24-point performance in a game the Cougars won by a touchdown. Arizona rolled to an easy victory in Pullman last year, but the Cougars still managed 37 points and 543 yards.\nIt’s a nightmare because … Washington State’s offense has improved over the last two years, while — because of injuries and inexperience — the Wildcats’ defense appears to be stalling. Linebackers Scooby Wright and Derrick Turituri won’t return this week, and Neal is still recovering from a hamstring injury.\nThose are just three names on what Rodriguez said is a 22-person injury list. The Wildcats must get healthy — and play well — to avoid falling victim to the Pac-12’s mad scientist.\n“Mike does what he does, and they have enough variety in the run game and the screen game to keep you off-balance,” Rodriguez said. “Whatever they have, there are a lot of adjustments out of it.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c47d660a401556d2cda0cdf550493e6d1fa9b13/c=87-0-612-525/local/-/media/2015/08/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635762183712997114-arizonawildcats.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8ffc7632601e80ff00fef42ef6946d9f1092c071/c=0-0-2324-2324/local/-/media/2015/10/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635808930489568345-booker.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:13:47.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
