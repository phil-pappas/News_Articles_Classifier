The Rangers (2-6), who fell 49-14 to Murphysboro on Friday, recovered in the second half of the contest to score a touchdown in each of the final two quarters and keep the SIRR-Ohio co-leaders from a shutout. This leaves Benton just as hungry for the final week victory. Offense The Rangers have a pass-rush combination with the talent to shred any opponent. But against Murphysboro, the Benton offense couldn't find its footing with 239 total yards against the Red Devils' 334. On the plus side, the Rangers did muster 124 yards in the air for more than half the team's total. Anna-Jonesboro totaled 365 yards with 245 on the ground. In contrast to Benton, A-J only picked up 80 yards passing, less than one-fourth of its total. It's strong ground game was achieved with great ball control, like the zero turnovers — fumbles or interceptions — against Sparta. Defense Benton consistently puts up a strong defense with a superior pass rush, solid middle and equally solid secondary. Unfortunately those positives didn't quite gel against the Murphysboro offensive onslaught that buried the Rangers under seven touchdowns on Friday. Anna-Jonesboro's battle with Sparta — the team that beat Benton in week 2 — showed the characteristics the Ranger defense possesses but that did not rise to the top for on Friday against Murphysboro. A-J holding Sparta to just 33 yards rushing on 14 carries, and holding the Sparta air attack to an average 8.3 yards per completion is evidence of a dynamic defensive effort. Summary The two teams' season records are a false representation of how good both Benton and A-J can play. The key to a final week victory may come down to the amount of time their defenses spend on the field. For Benton that means even keener offensive ball control that can keep the defense rested and that provides more scoring opportunities. When the dust settles tomorrow night, for the last night of season on Tabor Field, Benton could easily see its season record finish at 3-6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:29:39.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
