Now it’s on to Saskatchewan.\n\"I’ve been in this league long enough to know that playing in Regina is not an easy thing to do, so we have to have a sharp week of practise.”\nHeading into Pile O’ Bones this go-round has a slightly different feel.\nThe Roughriders have won just twice this year . At the same time, their extremely loyal fan base can work the turnstiles for more than the 28,517 that showed up at Commonwealth last Saturday to watch the CFL’s best team.\nAnd, they can rattle a visiting offence because they know that’s when they have to be the loudest.\n“I’ll be curious to see how it affects the crowd,” said Reilly. “That place is usually sold out. In terms of their team, I don’t even look at their record because I know the kind of players that they have on their defence for a number of years.\n“They have some new faces and new coaches, but the guys are the same -— (Tyron) Brackenridge, (John) Chick, all those guys. They’ve all been there for a while. I know what they’re capable of and they have a good defence. They’ve got good players.”\nEven though the Roughriders players are obviously frustrated with their season, these last few games could be their last chance to show what they have.\n“Their schemes may have changed but I know their guys pretty well,” said Reilly. “Whether or not playoffs are involved, guys are still going to take it as fighting for their jobs next season. We’ve been in that situation a couple of years ago. I know how it affects your locker room and I know true pros are going to fight for their jobs.”\nReilly had 332 yards passing and the offence outproduced B.C. by 230 yards but had to go down to the wire to get the W.\n“Speaking offensively, I though we were flagged correctly,” said Reilly after reviewing game films. “When we were flagged, it was because we were doing the wrong thing. That’s something that hasn’t shown up much this season. We addressed it right away, like we did earlier in the season. It’s accountability on everybody’s part, mine included. Everybody who watched the tape knows it wasn’t bad reffing. It was lack of discipline on our part.\n“The good news is that’s something we can fix, something we can control. We’ve done it for 12 weeks of the season, but for some reason in two or three weeks, we haven’t been doing it as good.”\nHead coach Chris Jones was in agreement that one of the offence’s better outings of the season could well have been wasted due to their lack of discipline.\n“We earned the great majority of those, especially the holding,” said Jones. “Those were well-earned. There was a couple of the pass interference calls I didn’t agree with. Other than that, we have to play a much cleaner game. We can’t turn the ball over, give up a blocked field goal and explosions in man-to-man coverage and expect to get where we want to go. We’ve played some pretty clean football over the course of the last 10 weeks and we need to get back to that.”\ncon.griwkowsky@sunmedia.ca\nEdmonton Eskimos not taking the brutal Saskatchewan Roughriders for granted\nBy Con Griwkowsky , Edmonton Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 04:22 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 06:02 PM EDT\nMike Reilly has seen the enemy and he didn’t have to look far.\nThe Edmonton Eskimos needed a late-game, almost unheard of in the CFL, 15-play drive to salvage the Eskimos’ sixth straight win.\nThe B.C. game was tougher than it had to be due to a series of untimely penalties.\nAlso in this article Photos: Edmonton Eskimos beat the B.C.
