Robertson broke his leg in two places that day, which happened nearly four years ago when Blackston was the holder and Robertson the kicker at Central Junior High in Springdale. \nThe injury happened in the final two minutes in the last game of the season and Robertson was in at kicker only because the starter, David Vowell, was out with a pulled hamstring. Robertson, a tough and sturdy linebacker by trade, had his season end in a frightening way when the tibia and fibula in his right leg were broken. \n“I was shocked by what I saw,” Blackston said about the immediate aftermath of the play. “Jacob was in terrible pain and my stomach just dropped. His leg was bent in half. I didn’t know what to do except to hold his leg propped up. Seems like it took forever for the ambulance to get there.” \nRobertson faced a long rehabilitation of four years because of the injury and no one would’ve blamed him had he decided to walk away from football. But Robertson said that option never entered his mind. \n“I wasn’t going to quit,” he said. “I love football and my friends and teammates helped keep me going through my rehab. They wanted me to get back on the field.” \nFast forward to this season, where Robertson and Blackston are still teammates and senior leaders for the surprising Wildcats (6-1, 4-0), who lead the 7A-West Conference standings. Robertson had six tackles and Blackston a touchdown catch in a 47-43 victory over Fayetteville last week. \nThe Wildcats hope to follow that big victory with a road win tonight at Fort Smith Southside. Har-Ber knows it can count on solid defensive play from Robertson (5-foot-9, \n228) who leads the Wildcats with 55 tackles on the season. \nHar-Ber coach Chris Wood compares Robertson to other standout defensive players from Springdale, including Robertson’s father, Dale Robertson, an all-state player on the Bulldogs’ state championship team in 1989. \n“He’s a typical Springdale type linebacker,” Wood said of his senior linebacker. “His dad was a fantastic player for coach (Jarrell) Williams over at Springdale and Jacob is a lot like him. He is physical and he has the instincts to where he controls the tackle-to-tackle box.” \nEven for someone as tough as Robertson, the recovery from a shattered right leg was slow and often painful. But Robertson returned his sophomore year and won his job back at linebacker as a junior. \n“My shin was shattered in like five or six places,” Robertson said. “Rehab took a long time, but I started to get healthy again toward the end of my sophomore year. At that point, I felt like I was back at full speed.” \nRobertson is again bearing down and knocking heads with ball carriers as the memories from that terrible day four years fade into the past. After football, Robertson plans to rejoin the Har-Ber wrestling team after placing sixth in the state as a sophomore. \n“Having Jacob Robertson back will help tremendously,” Har-Ber wrestling coach Nika West said. “He is a very good athlete who can help any team. It has been exciting to see him on the football field. He is very physical and, in both wrestling and football, that can help a lot.” \nRobertson hopes to continue his athletic career in football after high school. But he’s focused on the present, where Har-Ber has won six consecutive games and taken over the lead in the 7A-West Conference. \n“We’ve got a good quarterback (Fuller Chandler) and our defense is a lot better,” Robertson said of his team’s turnaround from 3-8 a year ago. “Our tackling is a lot better and we’ve got some young guys who’ve really helped this year.” \nHar-Ber will take the field tonight as the top-ranked team in Class 7A following consecutive wins over Bentonville and Fayetteville. That means extra scrutiny for the Wildcats, who must also face Fort Smith Northside and Rogers Heritage before the state playoffs begin. \n“Jacob is one tough dude,” Blackston said. “He’s the most passionate guy we have out there. He treats all road games like a business trip, but he likes to have fun, too. I’m glad he’s on our team.” \nJacob Robertson \nSCHOOL Springdale Har-Ber CLASS Senior HEIGHT 5-9 WEIGHT 228 POSITION Inside linebacker NOTABLE Leads Har-Ber with 55 tackles, including five for lost yardage… Finished with 57 tackles as a junior. …Plans to rejoin Har-Ber wrestling team after finishing sixth in the state as a sophomore. … Father, Dale Robertson, was a middle linebacker and tight end on Springdale’s state championship team in 1989. \n(Advertisement)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:40:45.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
