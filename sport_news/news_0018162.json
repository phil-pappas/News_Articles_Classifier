In particular, the 650-horsepower Chevrolet Corvette Z06 is giving the Viper high-performance headaches.\nWith two years of leeway, it is possible that the Viper will get a reprieve. But if not, it will have already served its purpose of boosting confidence in Dodge, both inside and outside the company.\nFor the latest car news, follow @MaximRides and Dan Carney on Twitter.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/autowriterdan", "http://www.drivesrt.com/2015/viper/", "http://blog.caranddriver.com/snake-binned-dodge-viper-could-bow-out-in-2017/", "http://twitter.com/maximrides", "http://www.allpar.com/news/index.php/2015/10/viper-leaving-in-2017-30239"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:28:45.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
