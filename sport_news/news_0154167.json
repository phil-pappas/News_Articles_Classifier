But he wasn’t fit to play at the start of the week,” said Schmidt. \n“He trained pretty much fully today, so there are no real doubts on him for next week. \n“Jared’s got bruising, with inflammation and discomfort but that’s getting better by the day. He can walk and jog freely now. \n“It’s just the frustration that he hasn’t been able to train fully. We’d be quietly confident at the moment that he will be ready for France. \n“We’d expect he’d be able to train with the team on Wednesday. \n“I think Jared’s importance would be reflected by his combination with Robbie Henshaw when he has played. \n“They made a really good combination during the Six Nations,” added the 49-year-old New Zealander. \nAs a result of the change in positions veteran wing Tommy Bowe gets a start. \nAlthough he scored two tries last Sunday, his place had been in doubt after a poor performance in a warm-up Test against hosts England. \nKearney’s brother Dave starts on the other wing for the Six Nations champions, who have a side packed with experience captained by Paul O’Connell. \nAfter two comfortable wins, victory over Italy would see Ireland seal their place in the quarter-finals and also assure France of a last eight spot. \nThe two sides play each other in the final Pool D game on October 11 with the winner topping the table and avoiding a likely quarter-final against New Zealand who are close to sealing first place in Pool C. \nIreland team to play Italy: \nSimon Zebo, Tommy Bowe, Keith Earls, Robbie Henshaw, Dave Kearney, Johnny Sexton, Conor Murray, Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien, Peter O’Mahony, Paul O’Connell (capt), Iain Henderson, Mike Ross, Rory Best, Jack McGrath. \nReserves: Sean Cronin, Cian Healy, Nathan White, Devin Toner, Chris Henry, Eoin Reddan, Ian Madigan, Luke Fitzgerald.
