Why? Because they pay lots of money for advertisements to think that you should drink Coca-Cola for a living? No, I totally disagree with that,\" Brady said. \"And when people do that, I think that's quackery. And the fact that they can sell that to kids? I mean, that's poison for kids.\" \nIn response, Coca-Cola released a statement to Fox Business on Tuesday that said, \"All of our beverages are safe and can be enjoyed as part of a balanced lifestyle.\" \nThe company also added that they provide many drinking options for everyone. \n\"We offer more than 200 low- and no-calorie beverages in the U.S. and Canada and a wide variety of smaller portion sizes of our regular drinks,\" the company said in a statement. \"As a responsible beverage company and marketer, we prominently provide calorie and sugar information for our beverages so people can choose what makes sense for them and their families.\" \nFrosted Flakes also came under fire by Brady. The Patriots quarterback said that Tony the Tiger's cereal is part of the country's obesity problem. \n\"You keep eating those things and you keep wondering why we do have just incredible rates of disease in our country,\" Brady said. \nKellogg's took exception to that comment and said in a statement that cereal is associated with lower BMIs. \n\"Cereal is a delicious and nutritious breakfast,\" a Kellogg spokesperson told Fox. \"Numerous studies show that a cereal breakfast is associated with lower BMIs (body mass index) \nTom Brady is not a fan of Coke or Frosted Flakes.
