If somebody says it was pre-planned, I don't agree with it. It is an accident and investigation should happen by CBI or state and guilty should be punished. Innocents should not be victimised in the name of investigation.\n\"Law should take its course and there should be fair investigation. I condemn any attempt to give political or communal colour to this incident. Such people are neither well wishers of the society nor of the country,\" Sharma said.\nThe minister also held a meeting at the village temple and said Hindu families have promised to protect the Muslim families.\nREAD ALSO: Dadri lynching a pre-planned murder, says Asaduddin Owaisi\nHis remarks came as parties stepped up attack on the BJP, alleging that it was trying to polarise the people on religious lines with such incidents.\nAfter meeting the victim's family, AIMIM leader Owaisi hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his silence on the issue, saying the \"Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas PM\" should have at least sent his condolences in a tweet if \"he believes in pluralism and upholding of law\".\n\"This wasn't an attack over meat. He has been killed in the name of religion. This is a pre-planned, cold-blooded killing. It cannot be an accident,\" he said.\nREAD ALSO: Rumours are baseless but can wreak havoc, says UP CM\nThe AIMIM leader also hit out at Union Minister Mahesh Sharma.\n\"Mahesh Sharma is the culture minister of the country and it is unfortunate that the minister who has taken oath on the Constitution doesn't have the courage and intellectual honesty to condemn the incident unconditionally,\" the Hyderabad MP said.\n\"He and his PM say 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas', then such incidents happen. These words should be put into practice,\" he said.\nREAD ALSO: Priest, 2 youths 'major links', police say\nBreaking his silence, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhikesh Yadav too targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying those who spoke against \"pink revolution\" should ban beef exports and alleged that they wanted to disturb the \"secular\" ethos of the country by raising such issues.
