Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Maryland's offense couldn't take advantage of three Michigan turnovers on Saturday. \nMaryland’s defense has often been put in difficult situations this season and forced to defend short fields after turnovers by the offense. In fact, the Terps defense has had to deal with it the most out of any team in the nation — Maryland ranks 127th of 127 with 17 turnovers this season. \nBut things were different against Michigan on Saturday. The Maryland defense stepped up and forced a season-high three turnovers, the first time this season the Terps haven’t had a negative turnover margin in five games this season. \nThe Michigan defense, though, locked down after any turnovers in the Wolverines’ 28-0 win . Any opportunity to score or swing momentum was immediately snuffed out by Michigan. \nAfter three Michigan turnovers, Maryland ran nine plays, had a total of minus-1 yards, punted twice and threw an interception. \n“First of all, our defense gave us a lot of opportunities to do more than we did,” quarterback Caleb Rowe said. “Hats off to them. I'm a little bit at a loss for words right now. It's just a matter of we need to get better this week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:18:17.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
