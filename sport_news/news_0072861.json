We just wanted to acknowledge him for his hard work and all that dedication.\" \"We were happy to do it just to show him a little bit of love and respect for what he's done for us,\" said Brock Holt. \"He loves what he does and he's really good at it. Just being around him, he's a good person. We're going to miss him and everyone that watches him on TV is going to miss his voice calling the games, for sure.\" NESN did not renew Orsillo's contract, inspiring a firestorm of criticism both regionally and nationally in August. Earlier this week, it was announced that Orsillo will become part of the broadcast team for the San Diego Padres in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:32:12.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
