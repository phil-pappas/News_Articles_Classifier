With a spot up for grabs in the title game, the top-seeded Bay State Buccaneers (9-1) face the fourth-seeded Middleboro Cobras (7-4) in the semifinals on Saturday night at Bridgewater State University at 7:30 p.m. The two rivals have had their share of battles over the years – with the Cobras playing the big brother role to the Buccaneers – and this one has all the makings of another installment in the rivalry. “Making it to the championship game has always been our goal, but going through Middleboro would be the icing on the cake,” said Bay State head coach J.P. McKernan. “They’re playoff tested so we have to bring our ‘A’ game.” Said Middleboro team owner and offensive lineman Garrett Perry: “The Bucs’ talent is always at the top of the league. But now I think they’re more disciplined. We hate those guys and they hate us. But I can’t say enough about how much they’ve improved.” To even get to this point, the Cobras, unlike the Buccaneers who had a first-round bye, had to get past the Quincy Militia in their opening round game and did so in convincing fashion, winning, 35-8. “Quincy had been playing as well as anybody,” Perry said. “Our game was very complete. We were very fundamentally sound. When you talk about trying to advance in the playoffs, it was the type of performance we were hoping to have.” Quarterback Andre Barboza, a midseason pickup for the Cobras, has turned into an x-factor and his talent was on full display against the Militia. Barboza tossed three touchdown passes and also ran for a score as his presence versus the Buccaneers could help push the Cobras to the next round. “Saturday was an example of the lift he can give our team,” Perry said. “He had a tremendous game. He’s a huge factor in how much we improved.” While Barboza has provided a spark to the Cobra offense, all indications are it will be a defensive affair when Bay State and Middleboro meet. The Buccaneers boast the top defense in the EFL, allowing only 8.9 points per game during the regular season, but the Cobras are near the top of the league defensively as well. “Playoffs are always like that,” said McKernan of postseason games determined by defensive play. “We know Middleboro has a tough defense. One mistake could cost you the game.” In Week 6 of the regular season, which occurred on Aug. 15, the Buccaneers dominated the Cobras in all facets of the game en route to a 22-0 win. Perry hopes that team’s development since then and also with the insertion of Barboza at quarterback since he did not suit up in the first meeting against Bay State, will bring a different outcome this time around. Page 2 of 2 - “We played really poorly,” Perry said. “We tackled poorly and turned the ball over. They made us pay for every mistake we made. “I think we’re a very different team than we were midseason. It wasn’t that long ago, but in terms of how we’re playing, it seems like a long time ago.” For Bay State, it’s not concerned with what happened in the regular season against Middleboro. Instead, the Buccaneers are focusing on getting a win to advance to next week so that they have a shot at a championship. “We just have to play as a team,” McKernan said. “Every man doing his job. Playing through adversity. “I can’t say one thing is going to be the key because you never know what can happen in the playoffs,” McKernan said. “If we stick together and play Bucs’ football, we’ll come out on top.” The last time the Buccaneers played for an EFL Championship was eight years ago when they defeated the Charlestown Townies, 20-12. The Cobras have captured 11 EFL titles, with their most recent coming in 2012 as part of back-to-back championship seasons. In the other semifinal Saturday night, the Taunton Gladiators are at the Worcester Mass Fury.
