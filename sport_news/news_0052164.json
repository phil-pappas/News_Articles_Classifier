Greiner, a Yreka resident since 1988, recently won the 12-race Summit Series Championship at the Samoa Drag Strip inEureka,Calif. He won the last six out of seven races, and the last seven out of nine, as well. “It was great to dominate like that,” Greiner said. Many of those Greiner races against are in their 20’s and 30’s, so being able to still perform at a high level at age 63 means a lot to him, he said. Greiner has no plans to go back to the sidelines any time soon, he said. “As long as I can get up and get in the car I will keep on racing,” he said. “It makes me feel young.” Greiner also helps put on cars shows throughout the area and recently helped put on the Sizzling September Car Show inYreka and a show inFort Jones earlier this month. He took a hiatus of around 10 years from drag racing and decided if “the opportunity arrived,” he would return. Greiner finally came back around three years ago when his now main sponsor, Lucas Oil, asked if he would like to get back behind the wheel. Currently, he is also sponsored by Lithia Dodge inMedford, Ore., Suds City AutoSpa in Yreka, and Hughes Engines. He is now competing in in his 1973 Plymouth Duster in more than 30 races a year throughout California, as well as in parts of Oregon and Nevada. Greiner said the key to doing well in drag racing “is all about consistency and reaction time,” which he said has been a strength of his and has helped him perform at a high level. A well known figure in drag racing for a number of years in California, Greiner said he loves the close bonds he has formed in the drag racing circuit. “Ilike the people around me,” he said. “In drag racing, we’re a big family. That’s what makes it so great.I’m here to race and have fun.” Greiner is competing in one more race this year this weekend in Redding,Calif., and will begin the new season the first of January.
