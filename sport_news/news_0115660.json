His one scoring pass went to Caden Kulp, who finished with five catches for 77 yards and carried the ball 13 times for 94 yards. \nTrinity (4-3) turned to Kulp and the running game in the second half, which is partly why it was able to outscore the Stars (5-3) after the break. \nThe Knights scored the only touchdown of the second half on an Ian Caddow 5-yard run. \n“The future is going to be bright. We’ve got a good group of warriors. If we play like we play, you see what you have on the inside,” said Trinity head coach Les Robinson of his team’s fight in the second half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:04:58.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
