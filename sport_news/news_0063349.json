It's the postseason. Tensions and emotions throughout baseball are at an all-time high.\nAdChoices That's especially true for Toronto Blue Jays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki.\nTulo's night started out great, launching a three-run home run in the third inning off Kansas City Royals starter Johnny Cueto to put the Jays up 6-2 in ALCS Game 3.\nThose highs were followed by some lows later in the game.\nTo start the seventh inning, Tulowitzki struck out looking and had some choice words for home plate umpire John Hirschbeck.\nThe situation cooled and it seemed to have passed until the top of the eighth inning when Tulo took the field. Apparently, the shortstop continued to argue balls and strikes and was ejected while standing in the field.\nThat ejection made him the first American League player to get tossed in a postseason game in 27 years:\nTroy Tulowitzki is the 1st AL player to be ejected in a #postseason game since Dwight Gooden in 1998. #ALCSonFS1\nâ€” FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 20, 2015 The Royals made it interesting in the ninth by scoring four runs, but the Blue Jays claimed Game 3 by a score of 11-8.\nMORE MLB: Want stories delivered to you?
