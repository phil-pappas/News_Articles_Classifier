His score was the third best individual tally from the five teams participating. Richard Gustaffsson was the low medalist with a 4-over-par 74. \nFellow Gladiator Nick Schroers almost made the regional, but lost in a four-hole playoff. \n\"He has been steady all year,\" Gladiator coach Tim Morris said of Oliver's play. \"He is starting to come into his own. I'm looking forward for him to have a successful regional tournament. He has the ability to shoot in the 70s.\" \nMeanwhile, Luray won the Conference 44 tournament with a 339, two strokes better than second place Altavista's 341. Stonewall Jackson was third with a 371, followed by Riverheads with a 380 and William Campbell with a 390. \nThe 1A East Regional will be played on Monday at the Hobbs Hole Golf Course in Tappahannock Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/2015/09/29/oliver-qualifies-regional/73058920/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:58:35.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
