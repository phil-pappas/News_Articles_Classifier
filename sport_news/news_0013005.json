In Fennelly’s 21 years as the women’s basketball coach in Ames, it’s one of the youngest teams he’s had. \nDon’t count on that being an excuse. \n“We’re going to have to coach them really hard because they’re going to have to play,” Fennelly said during his media day news conference. “They came here to play. They’re all different positions and they’re all very skilled, but you’re going to see a lot of all three of them this season. No doubt about that.” \nBridget Carleton — Iowa State’s first Canadian recruit and versatile 6-foot-1 guard — and TeeTee Starks along with forward Meredith Burkhall will all play key roles for Iowa State, but it’s the return of guard Jadda Buckley that could be the x-factor. \nBuckley played in nine games last season, but suffered a stress injury to her right foot that forced her out. A medical red-shirt gave the Mason City native a chance to have three more years of eligibility and build on a true freshman season where she averaged 10.9 points, 3.3 assists and 2.3 rebounds. \nAfter the departure of four-year starting point guard Nikki Moody, Buckley’s been handed the keys to the point guard job. She was able to learn the position as an observer last season, which has made the transition as the go-to point guard easier. \n“I think I was really able to see what he was actually saying by watching it rather than when I’m in those shoes,” Buckley said. “I think being able to see it then see it from a different standpoint, now I have both perspectives and can kind of put it together.” \nThe Cyclones had three seniors play significant roles last season, but Nicole “Kidd” Blaskowsky is the only senior with much experience this year after averaging 7.7 points and 4.1 rebounds per game. \nForward Madison Baier is the other senior on the roster, but Blaskowsky has taken on the role of helping bring the underclassmen out of their shell and getting them ready to play big roles on the team. \n“It’s definitely going to be a more vocal year and as the year goes on, some of the younger ones are going to be vocal, too, which is going to be pretty exciting because I like getting hyped,” Blaskowsky said. \nISU WOMEN 2015-16 \nl Coach: Bill Fennelly (21st year at ISU, 434-206; 28th overall, 600-259) \nl Last year: 18-13 overall, 9-9 in Big 12; Lost in first round of NCAA tournament \nl Key returners: G Jadda Buckley, G Seanna Johnson, G Kidd Blaskowsky, C Bryanna Fernstrom, G Emily Durr \nl Key losses: G Nikki Moody, G/F Brynn Williamson \nl Key newcomers: G Bridget Carleton, G TeeTee Starks, F Meredith Burkhall \nl Comments: montzdylan@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:45:03.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
