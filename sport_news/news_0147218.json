The thing about it, if you watch how our team fought back, we are very proud of them. The thing it can do is make us stronger, make them just believing in themselves.\n\"I told them that after the game in the locker room. I said, What's amazing is to watch how we fought back, 21 down in the third quarter and for us to go on that run in the fourth quarter, score two touchdowns within three or four minutes at the end.The amazing performance by Jerrod was just unbelievable. You see it a lot. You don't want that to be overshadowed because he played an unbelievable game.\"\nStrong on defensive issues\n\"If you look, the one run before half, we actually missed the tackle. You see guys that are coming in on the ball. When you attack it from the secondary, you got to keep it in front. The running back kind of got lost in the pile, so he ends up bouncing out too far inside on the 76-yard run. It was a guy up his gap but once it breaks the line of scrimmage, we're in zone coverage, so all eyes should be on the ball. We just don't make the play. It's more of a fundamental technique breakdown that can be corrected.\"\nStrong on Jerrod Heard\n\"But, no, I always felt like this with Jerrod. You just don't know what you're going to get sometimes. You walk out there at practice, you watch him practice sometimes, it's like, Wow! You throw him out there in the game, the things he does, when he goes back, he knows this, if I can't find a receiver, I know I can take off with it, make people miss in the open field. He has the athletic ability where he can do it. He won two state championships at the 6A level. For him to be a competitor the way he is, I'm not surprised at all.\"\nDT Poona Ford on team's mentality after the 45-44 loss to California\n\" After Saturday, even though we lost, I think it's a huge confidence booster. In the fourth quarter we battled. We know what our defense can be capable of and our offense can score.\"\nRB Johnathan Gray on the team's feeling after Saturday\n\"The Horns are definitely coming.' I feel what we displayed last week was amazing. You saw a team down 21 points. For us to rally back and even have a chance, then unfortunately we missed a field goal. But to put us back into almost going to overtime to a team we were supposed to lose to by 7 or 14, it shows how much fight we have and how much guys want it.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-09-22T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:43:37.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
