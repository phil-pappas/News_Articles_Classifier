He averaged 10.1 points and 5.5 rebounds, but this preseason has averaged 5.3 points and two rebounds. \nThe previous year, Barnes suffered a foot injury in the preseason and missed the start of the regular season. \nBarnes, 23, is in the midst of a negotiation period for a contract extension. He can either sign with the Warriors by the Oct. 31 deadline or become a restricted free agent next summer. \nThe injury put a damper on the Warriors' first game at Oracle Arena since winning the championship. \nStephen Curry scored 14 points and dished out seven assists but was 1 for 8 from 3-point range and committed four turnovers in 21 minutes. He did make highlight-reel plays, hitting a deep floater and tossing a behind-the-back pass to Marreese Speights for a layup. \nFans that lined up early to collect free Curry MVP bobbleheads began leaving after he checked out of the game in the third. The Warriors never held a lead in the second half as Denver was led by Kenneth Faried's 22 points. Advertisement \nThe Nuggets were able to shoot 49.5 percent from the field, as the Warriors were held to 40.2 percent. \nLeandro Barbosa led the Warriors with 16 points, and Draymond Green added 15. \nThe Warriors shot 24.1 percent from 3-point range but did see Jarell Eddie make his preseason debut and hit his first shot attempt from long distance. \nEddie is among the players competing for a roster spot as a reserve shooting guard behind Barbosa. \nGreen smiled at the memory of interacting with President Barack Obama in San Francisco on Saturday. \n\"As soon as I walked up, he was like, 'My guy! My favorite player,' \" Green said. \"That was pretty dope to me.\" \nCurry had previously insisted to Green that when he met Obama in February at the Oval Office, the president had very much wanted to talk about the Michigan State product. Watching Green and Obama exchanging pleasantries confirmed that. \n\"When Draymond turned the corner, (Obama's) voice kind of took another notch of volume: 'Hey Draymond, my guy, my guy,' \" Curry said. \"That was pretty funny.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:36:21.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
