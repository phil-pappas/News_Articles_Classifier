I love hot wings,\" she disclosed. \"After my last fight, one of the UFC owners flew in a private chef from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro so that he could make me hot wings, because there are no hot wings in Rio! That’s how important they are to me.\"\nRousey clearly has no issue flaunting her feminine figure for Self . But when it comes to her professional life, she doesn't want her gender to play a part in her success. \"I want my name to be mentioned along with Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali,\" she declares. \"And I don't want the word woman to be in front of champion.\"\nRousey has impressed another fellow feminist. Beyonce has used the athlete's inspiring \"do nothing b**ch\" speech during her performances, and that thrills Rousey. \"To be honest, it's a honor to have a real powerhouse of a woman like Beyonce just recognize my existence,\" she told ET. \"Such a huge compliment, I couldn't be more grateful.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.etonline.com/news/171836_ronda_rousey_admits_she_the_biggest_crier/", "http://www.self.com/fashion/celebrity/2015/10/ufc-champion-ronda-rousey-best-fighter-world/", "http://www.etonline.com/news/171466_ronda_rousey_responds_to_ronda_rousey_on_beyonce_using_her_do_nothing_speech_it_surreal/", "http://www.etonline.com/movies/173859_ronda_rousey_reveals_her_plan_for_winning_the_role_of_captain_marvel/", "http://www.etonline.com/news/169181_celebs_react_to_ronda_rousey_impressive_34_second_ufc_win/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:46:24.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
