Their actions had no malice or harmful intention.” \nDetails of the specific incidents have not been released, however, Quinlan ruled that “each player committed an act of foul play contrary to law”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:23:24.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
