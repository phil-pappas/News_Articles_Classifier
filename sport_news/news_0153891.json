The squad were originally due to leave on Monday but were told to stay back after their government warned of potential security risks. “Following the most recent information from Australian Government agencies and our own security advisers we have decided that, regrettably, we have no alternative but to postpone the tour,” Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement. CA sent a delegation to Bangladesh over the weekend to assess the situation and while they were there an Italian aid worker in Dhaka was shot dead in an attack that Islamic State said it had carried out. The delegation arrived back in Australia on Wednesday to brief government and CA officials and confirmed the cricketers could be targeted. CA’s decision came two days before the squad’s scheduled warm-up match at Fatullah and despite the BCB offering the touring side a level of security reserved for visiting heads of state. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:23:32.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
