Early on, he whipped a shot at Impact goalkeeper Evan Bush, attempting to curl it from the top of the box into the bottom right-hand corner. Bush just got his fingertips on the strike to knock it wide.\nA few minutes later, midfielder Robbie Findley played Giovinco into the box but the striker was offside.\nOn Toronto’s next attack, Findley again whipped a ball in, this time on the six-yard line, but it was just out of reach for the Italian.\nA great bit of skill by the Italian striker made room for himself to set up Altidore just before halftime.\nGoing into the break, it seemed like momentum was on Giovinco’s side and producing another highlight-reel moment wasn’t out of the question. But he faded in the second half.\nWith his squad absorbing much of pressure, the opportunities just didn’t come.\nIt’s not a half that at all reflected Giovinco’s season.\nThe Italian began his goal-scoring campaign this season against the Chicago Fire in April.\nHis most productive month in front of the goal came in July, when he tallied five goals in four games. He won the MLS goal of the week award just once, in mid-August for a free kick against Orlando City Soccer Club.\nThe only Toronto FC player to capture the Golden Boot, Giovinco scored off a penalty kick three times, and seven of his 22 goals were game-winners.\nMore on thestar.com\nToronto FC falls to Montreal Impact in regular-season finale\nMiami Dolphins' offence decimates hapless Houston Texans", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://www.mlssoccer.com/stats"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:04:06.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
