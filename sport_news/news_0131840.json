Special photo by William Lofton slideshow CANTON — Despite Brittain Brown rushing for 255 yards and three touchdowns, Cherokee could not secure a victory in a crucial Region 5 matchup against Milton, falling 28-21 on Friday at Tommy Baker Field.Brown single-handedly gave the Warriors (4-3, 2-3) the lead in the second half on Cherokee’s first two possessions. Trailing 14-7, the senior ran for a 62-yard touchdown on the Warriors’ first play of the third quarter to tie the game.After forcing Milton (2-5, 2-3) to go three-and-out, Brown exploded for an 82-yard touchdown run — again on the first play of the drive — to hand Cherokee a 21-14 lead.Just as quickly as the Warriors took the lead in two plays, Milton countered the shifting momentum when Patrick Bond returned the ensuing kickoff down to the Cherokee 22-yard line. The Eagles scored three plays later and tied the game.After a series of punts led both teams into the fourth quarter, Milton regained the lead when Cameron Adams scored on a 51-yard run.Cherokee never captured the momentum again and turned the ball over on downs on the team’s final two possessions.“We made a few too many mistakes here and there,” Cherokee coach Josh Shaw said. “Unfortunately, during the course of a game, it’s the little mistakes that add up, and it’s a reflection at the end of the game on the scoreboard.”Cherokee’s loss created a three-team logjam for fourth place in the region between the Warriors, Milton and idle Wheeler. Each team has one win against the other two.Neither Cherokee nor Milton could find an answer to stop the run as both defenses conceded more than 200 yards rushing.Milton grabbed the initial lead for the third week in a row when Adams scored on a 5-yard run early in the first quarter. Cherokee leveled the score on its next possession when an eight-play, 80-yard drive ended with a 3-yard Brown rush.Adams scored his second rushing touchdown of the game to give the Eagles a 14-7 lead early in the second quarter on a 30-yard run.Brown and Adams buoyed the majority of each team’s offensive attack as each running back found the end zone three times. Adams rushed for 176 yards and Brown had 255.Cherokee quarterback Nolan Donley was 20-of-35 for 215 yards.After traveling to Lassiter next week, Cherokee will end the regular season with region leaders Walton and Roswell.“I want to make sure we finish out the year and don’t pack it in,” Shaw said. “I think we have enough instilled in our players to know that they are not going to quit. They are going to go to work and we still have a lot to play for. We’re a young football team, and we’re going to grow from (Friday).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:27:42.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
