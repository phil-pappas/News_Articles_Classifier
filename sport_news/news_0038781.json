It's as simple as that.\"\nThe roster is almost identical, but these are not the Senators who breezed through the final two months of last season. This is not the same team that captured a city's heart with a desperate, historical run to make the playoffs.\nThis edition is not playing with nearly enough passion, especially in its own end.\n\"We're not consistent enough,\" said Cameron. \"We're struggling right now with our play away from the puck. We're struggling with our compete level. We're working hard, but we're not competing.\"\nInstead of a practice, Cameron drove that point home in team meetings the morning before the Senators open a four-game homestand with Nashville Predators. He stressed the importance of winning the 1-on-1 battles, and he made it clear he's expecting improvement Saturday night against the Predators.\n\"You can work to get there, you can skate 200 feet to get there,\" said Cameron, \"but if you don't win that battle, you worked hard to get there but you didn't compete when you got there.\"\nThrough five games, the Senators are being outshot 179-125, including a 68-36 margin in the first period and 59-41 in the third. And those numbers aren't even as bothersome as the quality of shots they're allowing.\n\"There's a lot of room for improvement,\" defenceman Mark Borowiecki said about the tilted ice surface the Senators have been playing on. \"Time in your own zone is one thing, Grade A chances against is another. If you're in your own end not giving up much, so be it. There's a lot of skilled players in this league, they're going to hang on to pucks. (Thursday) night, (Sidney) Crosby and (Evgeni) Malkin are going to do what they're going to do.\n\"For us it's eliminating those Grade A chances and right now, we're just giving up way, way too many.\"\nAfter the Predators leave, the Senators will have three days of practices to work on getting things right. And how will they do that?\n\"Repeat, repeat, repeat,\" said Cameron.\nThey could have their drill sergeant cut them a little slack with a better performance Saturday. For the visit from the hard-working Predators, they will not have one of their own most diligent players, as Clarke MacArthur will miss his second game with a head injury.\nCameron could provide no details to MacArthur's status other than that.\n\"I don't have anything,\" he said. \"I haven't talked to the trainers today. His recovery is a work in progress.\"\nThat does mean Shane Prince will get another chance Saturday. In his season debut against the Penguins, Prince started on the fourth line but played with just about everybody at some point. He wound up with 12:22 of ice time and a minus-1 as the only mark on his stat line.\n\"I thought Shane was quick,\" said Cameron, \"and he was on the puck.\"\nWhile saying \"no\" when asked if he thought any of his defencemen could benefit by watching a game from the press box, Cameron also conceded there was a possibility Chris Wideman could get in his first NHL game Saturday.\n\"He might,\" said Cameron. \"We discuss him every game, so the 'might' category ... until he gets in you can say might every game.\"\nMeanwhile, Cameron would not reveal his starting goalie for because he hadn't talked to Craig Anderson and Andrew Hammond before meeting with the media.\nAnderson has started the past two games, but he has yet to play at home. Cameron said that fact was a consideration, but not a big one.\nIs he happy with the goaltending he's received thus far?\n\"Our whole team has another level,\" said Cameron. \"I don't think you can put that other level on one guy. It's a matter of getting your whole team to play to the level at the same time. That's the challenge. Our goaltending hasn't been bad.\"\nNor has it been good enough, just like the Senators as a whole.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nBrennan\nOttawa Sens lucky to be above .500 Coach Cameron says 'we're not consistent enough'\nBy Don Brennan , Ottawa Sun First posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 05:55 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 16, 2015 09:03 PM EDT\nThe Senators' record flatters them.\nThrough five games, they are fortunate to be a notch above the .500 mark.\nVideo replay and a coach's challenge showed they were an inch from blowing a lead, and quite possibly the game, in the season opener against Buffalo.\nAlso in this article Sens vs. Pens, Oct. 16, 2015 About the author Don Brennan Don Brennan's Blog Follow Don Brennan on Twitter Other Stories Senators stop Sid, but not Penguins\nThe Senators were able to extend the scoreless streak of Sidney Crosby to four games, but they could not push the Penguins to a similar drought.\n0\nOttawa Senators explode for 7 against Jackets\nFor the first part of Wednesday's game at Nationwide Arena, the Senators looked like they were distracted.
