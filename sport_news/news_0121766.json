Sana magkaroon ng chance na makilala ni PNoy yung achievement ko,” said Nietes.\nNietes became one of the top fighters of the famed ALA Promotions when he pocketed the vacant WBO world minimumweight title by decisioning Pornsawan Porpramook of Thailand on September 30, 2007 in Cebu.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:26:21.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
