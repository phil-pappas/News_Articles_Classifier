Jay Inslee Thursday expressed a \"profound sense of loss\" in the wake of the Roseburg shooting.\nHis comments came as word of the shooting reached Olympia just before a previously scheduled news conference.\nInslee has been a strong advocate of tighter gun safety regulations.\nHe's tried to get them through the legislature, but to no avail.\nIn the wake of today's tragedy he said called such shootings a national scourge.\n“The fact that such an advanced country technologically, culturally, democratically has this absurd rate of gun violence is just totally unacceptable,” the governor said. “And I have been willing to help move the needle on this including having supported bans on assault weapons that are totally unnecessary in civilized society.”\nInslee said tighter gun controls are not enough, that improvements to the mental health system are also necessary.\nHe did not propose any legislation, but could do so during the next legislative session.\ncomment (3)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:13:26.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
