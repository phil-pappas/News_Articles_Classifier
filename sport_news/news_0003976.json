Construction could begin by the end of the year.\nThe DeKalb County Development Authority unanimously approved backing for the 359,000-square-foot project Oct. 8 by giving the developer a discount on its property taxes over the next 15 years.\nRandy Holmes of Seven Oaks told the board that the 4004 Perimeter Summit building doesn’t have tenants yet, but many businesses are seeking office space in the area.\nHe said the agreement with the DeKalb Development Authority is “a critical step” that will allow his company to move quickly as other developers are also considering new construction.\n“The timing is right in the market given the very favorable fundamentals of the office market in the central perimeter,” Holmes said.\nRay Gilley, the authority’s president, called it a “mega project” in terms of its economic impact.\n“It is a project that we’re excited to see happen because you really don’t see that many office buildings built,” he said. “They have a strong idea that they’re going to have some client interest by the time the building is complete in 2017.”\nThe development is projected to generate $25.5 million in property tax revenue over the next 20 years for DeKalb County, DeKalb schools and the city of Brookhaven, according to a fiscal impact analysis conducted for the authority.", "external_links": ["http://sevenoakscompany.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/4004-Summit.pdf", "http://www.myajc.com/news/business/cumberland-district-wants-to-include-chattahoochee/nfbZg/"], "published": "2015-10-15T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:57:19.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
