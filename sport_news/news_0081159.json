James de Haas and Marly Quince assisted on the game-winning goal. \n“We were disappointed last night with how the game went down,” Clarkson coach Casey Jones said. “It was a real good character win today. I thought our speed was good. We made some good plays.” \nIt was a back-and-forth game for the Golden Knights, who wound up with a 31-28 edge in shots in a game played on the wider Olympic-size ice sheet. \nClarkson took a 1-0 lead at 17 minutes, 41 seconds of the opening period on a power-play goal from A.J. Fossen, his third goal of the season, with Sam Vigneault and Kelly Summers assisting. \nThe Golden Knights extended the lead to 2-0 when Troy Josephs scored on a penalty shot at 4:09 of the second period. \nUNH (1-2) responded quickly with a power-play goal from Kyle Smith just 18 seconds later, cutting the lead to 2-1. \nThe Wildcats scored another power-play goal at 8:48 on a shot from Maxim Gaudreault to tie the game 2-2. \nClarkson regained a lead when Jordan Boucher scored an unassisted goal at 4:11 of the third period, putting the Golden Knights up 3-2. \nBut once again UNH responded to a Clarkson goal by tying the game 3-3 at 10:03 of the third period on a shot from Max Dawson. \nBoucher had a good chance at another goal a few moments before DiNallo’s game-winner but was thwarted by a solid save from UNH goalie Danny Tirone, who finished with 27 saves. \nSteve Perry made 25 saves for the Golden Knights. \nClarkson played without sophomore forward Janick Asselin, who was suspended for one game by ECAC Hockey for a hit to the head in Friday’s game at Merrimack.
