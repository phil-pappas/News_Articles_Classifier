On Tuesday, the IOC gave Kuwait until Oct. 27 to resolve a dispute over its sports legislation. \nIn recent years, the IOC has suspended Kuwait, India, Ghana and Panama. All were eventually reinstated. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:25:43.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
