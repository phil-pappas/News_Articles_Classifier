(AP) - Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O'Malley says the nation needs not just new leadership but a new way of governing, one that invites people of all parties \"to return to the table of democracy.\"\nO'Malley spoke via video link Monday to about 1,000 New Hampshire voters at an event hosted by No Labels. The group was created after the 2010 midterm elections to bridge the divide between Republicans and Democrats.\nThe former governor of Maryland says he's achieved results with a \"circle of collaboration\" that focuses on what works.\nNo Labels leaders described the convention as \"speed dating\" for New Hampshire's independent voters, who can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primaries.\nSeven other candidates plan to participate, each introduced by someone from the opposing party.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
