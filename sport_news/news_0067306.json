The EOW conducted raids to arrest 79-year-old Tarsem Kumar, 56-year-old Uma Gupta, who is employed in the PGI as Assistant librarian and 50-year-old Anita Rani, kin of SE Amarjit Gupta, who are accused in the FIR registered last month. All of them were not found at their places and the police have stepped up efforts to arrest them. The police also contacted the PGI authorities to find out about Uma Gupta who was found to have proceeded on leave. Punjab SE Amarjit Gupta was booked in 2012 by the Punjab Vigilance Bureau in a corruption case. Amarjit’s father Tarsem, wife Uma Gupta and sister Anita Rani are in the dock for a fraud amounting to Rs 15.35 crore and the role of the SE Amarjit Gupta is also being investigated though he is not an accused in the FIR. The accused are Directors of a company who agreed to sell an SCO in Sector 46 as well as another one in Sector 38 and the total amount agreed was Rs 20 crore, for which it was to be sold to the complainants. A sum of Rs 15.35 crore has been paid by the complainants Nand Kishore and Sanjeev Kumar but only a share to the extent of 18 per cent has been transferred, it was alleged. Anita Rani is the Director of the firm and accused Uma Gupta is the owner of the substantial shares and it was on account of their connivance that the entire plan was executed, the police said. The three accused were to transfer 16 per cent of the shares on the receipt of 25 per cent of the amount, 32 per cent share was to be transferred on the receipt of 50 per cent of the amount and 48 per cent shares were to be transferred on the receipt of 70 per cent of the amount. The accused received 75 per cent of the amount (Rs 15.35 crore) but transferred only 18 percent of the shares, it was alleged. While opposing their bail application, the counsel for the complainants, Advocate Harish Bhardawaj, argued that custodial interrogation of the accused was needed for the recovery of the minutes books of members, proceedings book of Directors, shareholders, register of shareholders and directors among other documents following which the court dismissed their anticipatory bail application.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:05:35.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
