He should carve up San Fran’s secondary.\nRavens RB Justin Forsett vs. Browns — With Steve Smith Sr. out, the Ravens will run the ball more often. Browns defense has given up the second most rushing yards this season.\nBuccaneers RB Doug Martin vs. Jaguars — The Muscles Hamster has been hit or miss this season, but in Week 5 against a soft Jags team, he should have a big game.\nFalcons WR Leonard Hankerson vs. Redskins — If you haven’t noticed, Hankerson has jumped right over Roddy White in the dangerous ATL passing game.\nBrowns WR Travis Benjamin at Ravens — Baltimore is strong vs. the run, but not as sturdy in the passing game. This game could turn into a shootout.\nChargers TE Antonio Gates vs. Steelers — He’s baaack and has great timing going up against a tight end friendly Pittsburgh defense. Duds\nBengals QB Andy Dalton vs. Seahawks — He’s been the second best player in fantasy football, but you should sit Dalton this week. He’s due for a stinker and it smells like this week.\nLions RB Ameer Abdullah vs. Cardinals — He’s had the misfortune of facing tough defenses, and the trend continues for at least one more week.\nPatriots RB LeGarrette Blount at Cowboys — Don’t let the three touchdowns before the bye week fool you. This is Dion Lewis’ backfield.\nRams WR Tavon Austin at Packers — He deserves a roster spot, but let’s see if he can string a few good games along before giving him a starting job.\nRaiders WR Amari Cooper vs. Broncos — He’s probably been your best receiver, but going up against the fantasy killing Denver defense I’d bench him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:12:37.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
