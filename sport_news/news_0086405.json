United thought the danger had passed but referee Carlos Velasco Carballo spotted the France striker had handled the ball and pointed to the spot. \nDe Gea tipped Eremenko's penalty on to the post but the ball bounced into Doumbia's path off the goalkeeper's legs and he tucked the ball away. \nUnited would have been 2-0 down soon after had De Gea not tipped over Musa's chip. \nRooney drew the first save of the match from Igor Akinfeev in the 32nd minute but the CSKA goalkeeper had nothing else to do before the half-time whistle. \nVan Gaal brought Marouane Fellaini on for Bastian Schweinsteiger at the break. Little changed initially but United then started to improve. \nRooney then glanced the ball into Akinfeev's arms from Ander Herrera's cross. \nThe away fans held their breath as Musa entered the box after a CSKA break but he drilled into De Gea's arms and United went on the attack again. \nFinally the pressure paid off. Herrera sent Antonio Valencia down the right flank and he whipped in a low ball for Martial, who beat Akinfeev with a diving header. \nUnited pushed for a winner as CSKA tired. Rooney appealed for a penalty in the dying minutes when the ball appeared to touch the arm of a red shirt. \nMemphis Depay came on for Lingard, but did not make a telling impact and United had to make do with a point from their trek east.
