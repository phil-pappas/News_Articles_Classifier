It has a lot to offer. (Getty Images) By Michael Tunison \nWhen an NFL quarterback is playing poorly on the field, it opens the floodgates for criticism about things that would never matter if he were performing well. And so we have headlines and condemning tweets about Kirk Cousins' statement that he prefers to listen to NPR over local sports talk radio and to watch HGTV instead of ESPN , in part to tune out all the noise. \nThe obvious delights of \"Wait Wait â€¦ Don't Tell Me!\" aside, we suppose talking points about narrative, legacy and intangibles could be useful when it comes to NPR. \nBut what does Cousins gain from his HGTV habit? Maybe more than you think. Here are five shows from which the QB could have a lot to learn. \nHouse Hunters \nKirk Cousins, in the last year of his contract, is likely to be playing elsewhere next season, quite possibly competing for the starting job for a team where 8-8 would be considered an improvement. Houston? Kansas City? There are a number of possibilities. And Cousins has to know how to go about buying a home in that market. \nTiny House Hunters \nLike many NPR listeners, Cousins is mindful of not owning in excess of what he needs. Think of the carbon footprint! This means owning a more globally responsible home. He picks up many useful tips from this show. Flip or Flop \nCousins gets another reminder of how difficult it is to transform a distressed property (or, say, a football franchise) into something successful. This only further convinces him of how nice it would be to be the third quarterback on the Patriots depth chart. \nYou Live In What? \nLiving in a converted grain silo almost certainly won't help Cousins on the football field, though it's sure to provide many fawning anecdotes to sportswriters: \"Cousins has such a work ethic, it's like he lives on a farm. Wait, he does!\" \nHidden Potential \nThis is just metaphorical misery porn for Cousins. Sure, it's about houses, but what if it were about him? Just think of how good Cousins could be with a good offensive line and receivers who didn't get hurt. And without the pressure of showing up RGIII! Doesn't this couple looking for their starter home realize that? Maybe they should. Perhaps if Kirk just yells it at the screen some more, they will. \n*** \nMike Tunison is a freelance writer based in Alexandria, Va.
