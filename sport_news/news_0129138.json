It’ll be hanging right up there between the 1996 AFC Wild Card banner and that highly cherished 2014 AFC finalist banner. And, perhaps, hanging alongside Colts coach Chuck Pagano, too. It will say: “We led the Patriots at halftime, 2015.” That’s a significant accomplishment for the Colts, who are better tattletales than tacklers, more adept at snitching than scoring points, more likely to whine than win. In the end, as just about everyone – including, in their Hoosier hearts, most Colts fans – expected, it was the Patriots who were on top, 34-27. In what was billed as the Deflategate Bowl, it was the upset hopes of the Colts – and not the footballs – that were deflated. After the Colts pointed fingers, it was the Patriots who racked up the points. Perhaps not enough to satisfy the lust for revenge on the part of angry Pats fans, who were hoping for a lopsided win that would make the 45-7 result of last season’s AFC title tilt seem like a nailbiter. Most of New England was looking for an utter rout, something along the lines of, say, Chicago’s famous, 73-0, demolition of the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL championship game. While the final score wasn’t humiliating, the Colts managed to embarrass themselves with a bizarre – which is a polite word for, in this case, utterly stupid – fake punt call by coach Pagano. The Colts, who had led, 21-20, at halftime, were hanging in, trailing by only six with a little more than a minute remaining in the third quarter, when, on fourth-and-3 at the Indy 37, Pagano inexplicably had his team line up in a formation that not only drew a flag for being illegal, but also resulted in disaster. The center and one other player, safety Colt Anderson, lined up well away from their teammates, who were near the right sideline, and punter Pat McAfee. Suddenly the ball was snapped to Anderson, who was alertly tackled immediately for a loss by Brandon Bolden, giving the Pats great field position. Which they took advantage of, turning it into a touchdown and a 13-point lead. Henceforth, such foolishness will be known as “pulling a Pagano.” Desperate times, one might rationalize, call for desperate measures. Desperation seems to sum up the sorry situation of the Colts whenever they play the Patriots. Indy quarterback Andrew Luck, drafted first overall in 2012 – Tom Brady, you may recall, was picked 199th in 2000 – now is 0-5 against Tom Terrific and the Pats, including two lopsided losses in the playoffs. Page 2 of 2 - Which is why, most years, a win over the Colts is nothing special, simply something expected. This year was different, because of Deflategate. While most Colts fans acknowledged the Pats were a better team, it disturbed them that Brady and the Pats had, in their minds – as in that of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, as well – had cheated. New England felt differently, as did Judge Richard Berman. So this game, this Deflategate Bowl, was going to be Brady’s vindication, his revenge, his chance to take out the frustrations of enduring months of questioning of his character and honesty. Not surprisingly, he downplayed that coming into the game, as did Belichick and, at the coach’s direction, all of the Patriots. But you know this wasn’t just another game to them. This was the Deflategate Bowl. While they would have liked to win by more – a lot more – they won. And it’s important to remember that, as far as the Patriots are concerned, they’d never lost their self-respect.
