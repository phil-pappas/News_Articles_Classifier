We’ve got to execute it the best way we can, and hopefully everything will work out the way we want.”\nAll week, the Pats have emphatically attempted to neuter every story line that carried over from the previous four blowouts against Andrew Luck’s Colts, whether it was related to Deflategate or otherwise, so Blount and Lewis refused to assume success would be a given.\n“History isn’t going to play a factor in this game,” Blount said. “All of the other games we’ve played, they don’t matter in this one. We have to make sure we stay focused and look forward to playing this year’s team, not last year’s team or the team before that. They’ve got different players. They’re better at a lot of things. We’ve got to make sure we study them and stay on top of it.”\nIn four matchups since 2012, the Patriots ran the ball on 54.8 percent of their plays for 772 yards (5.0 yard average, 193 yards per game) and 15 touchdowns. By comparison, in 55 games against everybody else in that span, including the playoffs, the Patriots ran the ball on 40.2 percent of their plays for 6,350 yards (4.1 per carry, 115.5 per game) and 61 touchdowns.\nThe Patriots’ dominance on the ground against the Colts has been well-documented, as Jonas Gray’s Sports Illustrated cover will forever attest, but their commitment to the run in those games has been relatively dramatic. Quite frankly, it should continue, as the Colts rank 19th in run defense this season. They were 18th in 2014, so the numbers suggest they’re worse despite front-seven additions like Trent Cole, Nate Irving, Kendall Langford, Henry Anderson and David Parry.\nThe new bodies haven’t yet yielded a defensive turnaround, and the Patriots will attempt to exploit that on national television, regardless of their willingness to admit it.\n“We’ve just got to be ready,” Lewis said. “I’m sure they (the Colts) know what happened in the past, so they’re going to be ready to stop what we’re trying to do. This is going to be a completely different game. This game is going to be completely different than anything that happened last year, or any other teams we played this year so far, so we’ve got to execute the game plan and everything will work out.”\nBlount has blown up the stat sheet twice in the last three meetings against the Colts with 24 carries for 166 yards and four touchdowns in the 2013 divisional round and 30 runs for 148 yards and three scores in last season’s AFC title game. Gray mixed in a monstrous 37 carries for 201 yards and four touchdowns in the 2014 regular season.\nThe Patriots preferred a heavy usage with their power backs, which could be big for Blount again tomorrow, but Lewis has also been a horse between the tackles this season. There’s no reason this can’t be a two-man party.\n“We’ve just got to be physical and get the ball downhill,” Lewis said. “We’ve got to do a good job all week of reading our keys and being able to run the ball downhill.”\nBlount traced their consistent pounding of the Colts to dedication to film review. Unless the Colts find a way to stop the run overnight, the Patriots will continue to feed the beast.\n“As a running back, the more you get the ball, I feel like the better it is for you to get into a rhythm,” Blount said. “The better rhythm you get in, the tougher it is going to be for a defense to stop you. If you get into a rhythm, and you get a feel for how they’re playing, it’s going to be tough for any defense to stop you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:00:03.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
