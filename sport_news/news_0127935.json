Glynn dished out 30 assists to lead the Lady War Eagles statistically. But Von Gremp and Gallaway came up at big plays late in each set. \n\"Elleson, Lindsay and Alye were pretty consistent,\" Miser said. \"But we had some other people step up tonight. Paige didn't get many swings, but when she did, she made them count. Hope had some big kills out of the middle to help us get that lead in the second set. \n\"Erika Reaser came in in that third set and that's intimidating with a 6-2 girl on the other side. But she took care of the ball. We had a lot of people step up tonight.\" \nHeritage will play at 2 p.m. Tuesday in the state tournament at Conway High School against the No. 2 seed from the 6A/7A East. \nRogers coach Jeanna Breedlove said her team gave away too many points early and waited too long to rally. But the Lady Mounties will look forward to next week's state tournament. \n\"We kind of struggled with the environment in that second set,\" Breedlove said. \"They responded too late in both the first and second sets. We're not going to look backwards. We're going to look forward. A lot of my girls got playing time tonight and maybe that will bolster confidence and they will come together as a team with lots of energy and enthusiasm.\" \nSenior Samantha Lassiter led Rogers with 14 kills, while sophomore Hannah Martin chipped in with 10 kills and 14 digs. Madison Sherrill led the Lady Mounties with 16 digs, while Audrey Herrera had a match-high nine blocks. \nRogers (16-15-3, 5-9) will be the No. 6 seed in the tournament and face the No. 2 seed from the East at 6 p.m. Tuesday. \nSports on 10/21/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:16:15.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
