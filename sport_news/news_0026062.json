A statement by the Consumer Affairs Ministry said “to increase availability and to prevent hoarding of pulses, the government has amended the Central order under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 with immediate effect to enable imposition of stock limits on pulses sourced from imports, stocks held by exporters, stocks to be used as raw materials by licensed food processors and stocks of large departmental retailers.” On September 28, the government had extended the stock limit of pulses, oil seeds and edible oil till September 2016. It had exempted from the order exporters with the import-export code issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, licensed food processors and retailers and departmental stores with multiple outlets. Now, the exemptions to stocks of pulses held by these categories have been withdrawn. Many experts believe the step was unnecessary as it may cause the market situation to become less transparent. Restrictions on certified exporters would send wrong signals about business practices in India in the international market, they said. Officials, however, say it is a remedial measure to tame the prices till domestic produce arrives in the markets. Hoarding, they say, is the main reason for the hike in prices as there was no “real shortfall” in the country. Therefore, the move will ensure that no trader maintains more than the prescribed stocks. The officials say the extension of zero import duty on pulses and import of 5,000 tonnes of pulses from the Price Stabilisation Fund will help ease the prices. Besides, to boost the production, the minimum support price for urad and arhar has been increased to Rs 4,625 per quintal and for moong to Rs 4,850 per quintal. It is creating a buffer stock through procurement and imports of pulses. The government is also considering early finalisation of a long-term strategy for procurement of pulses to help incentivise its production. Besides, a move is also underway to create an independent agency to monitor the demand of essential commodities and make timely intervention. The country’s pulses production is estimated to have fallen to 17.38 MT in 2014-15 from 19.25 MT in the previous year due to poor monsoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:05:33.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
