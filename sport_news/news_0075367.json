We weren't worried about it,” said Jets head coach Paul Maurice. “At that point, a review is going to take a lot longer than a timeout. That was as much, in my mind, to extend (the delay) as long as they can. Which was good for us too. We got our defensive guys rested.”\nMaurice tweaked his defence pairings during the second period, reuniting Byfuglien with Toby Enstrom and moving Tyler Myers with Adam Pardy and the move paid dividends.\n“It's so unusual for a man that big to do some of the things that he can do, at high rates of speed,” said Maurice. “The second half of that game, he was really good all over the ice. In his own end and making plays. He helped us get our offensive game going.”\nSince relocating from Atlanta, the Jets are now 2-3 in home openers and are 7-7-2 all-time as a franchise.\nThe Flames scored first as Mikael Backlund deposited the rebound after Ondrej Pavelec stopped Sam Bennett on a wraparound attempt at 3:38 of the first period.\nBut the Jets took advantage of a fortuitous bounce to even the score as Blake Wheeler caromed a pass in front off the right skate of Little.\n“Once we tied that game in the second period, we found a new gear and controlled the play a lot more,” said Little, who has three goals in his past two games. “And that was a big goal by (Byfuglien) in the third. He's a guy that's fun to watch when he's playing his game. He's just so strong on the puck and he shows he's got a nice pair of hands and great shot too. When he wants to take that puck to the net, there's not many guys in this league that can stop him.”\nAfter producing 11 shots on goal in the first period, the Flames were held to only four shots during the second and needed nearly 11 minutes to record their first shot of the third, finishing with 20 overall.\nBut Pavelec managed to stay sharp despite the lack of work, making the necessary saves when called upon to improve to 2-1 on the season, while lowering his goals against average to 2.01 and raising his save percentage to .936.\n“You have to, you have no choice,” said Pavelec. “It's about how you focus for every shot and for every minute.”\nThere was a scary moment for the Jets during the third period as Wheeler appeared to suffer a wrist injury, but after a quick trip to the dressing room to get taped up, the right-winger was back on the ice and didn't miss a shift.\nAlthough Wheeler wasn't available to comment, he supplied the insurance marker by scoring an empty-netter with 52.8 seconds left in regulation, moving him to three goals and seven points in five games this season.\n“It's just work,” said Maurice. “He looks like he's going harder than everybody else on the ice. He's had some games where I don't think he was overly excited about the way it was going for him and he's ended up with a point or two.”\nken.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nWINNIPEG JETS\nByfuglien's dramatic goal gives Winnipeg Jets home-opener win over Calgary Flames\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 10:49 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:53 PM EDT\nDustin Byfuglien has a flair for the dramatic.\nThe Winnipeg Jets defenceman forced a turnover in the neutral zone with under two minutes to play and put the puck between his legs before fooling Karri Ramo with an off-speed shot to propel his team to a 3-1 victory over the Calgary Flames.\nByfuglien's goal wasn't without a hint of controversy as Flames head coach Bob Hartley used his coach's challenge to see if the marker would be overturned because of an offside.\nHowever, the goal stood and gave Byfuglien his second of the season.\nThe Jets, who improved to 4-1, continue a six-game homestand on Sunday afternoon against the St. Louis Blues.\nSince relocating from Atlanta, the Jets are now 2-3 in home openers and are 7-7-2 all-time as a franchise.\nFollowing the opening ceremony, the Jets came out and threw their weight around a bit but it was the Flames that scored first.\nAbout the author Ken Wiebe Ken Wiebe's Blog Follow Ken Wiebe on Twitter Other Stories Jets fly out of the gate\nBetter than expected, yet ample room for improvement.\n0\nNikolaj Ehlers scores first NHL goal, Michael Hutchinson shines as Winnipeg Jets dump Rangers\nNEW YORK – During his first appearance on Broadway, Michael Hutchinson stole the show.\n0\nSee more from Ken Wiebe »\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Election primer: Where the party leaders stand on issues\n0\nWorld media on Canada's election: Pierre Trudeau in the news again\n0\nAttack on TPP is attack on all trade\n0\n'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' poster revealed\n0\nPaul McCartney's boyish enthusiasm shines in Toronto show\n0\nElection primer: Where the party leaders stand on issues\n0\nAttack on TPP is attack on all trade\n0\nFederal party leaders rally voters as election enters final stretch\n0\n'Goosebumps' tops 'The Martian,' at box office while 'Crimson Peak' falls flat\n0\nWorld media on Canada's election: Pierre Trudeau in the news again\n0\nSun Reporters Ganter & Longley on Blue Jays Win\nAndrea Christidis remembered\nJays get ready for Game 5\nBob Elliott and Steve Buffery on the Blue Jays win\nGame 5 will be The Stroman Show\nMore from Hockey Kessel, Crosby quiet as Penguins defeat Maple Leafs 0\nLeafs' Bozak misses game against Penguins 0\nWith Domi and Duclair, Coyotes doing player development right 0\nFantasy Fare: It's all so pointless 0\nThe Phil Kessel Quote: book 0\nInside Toronto sun.com News\nWhere the party leaders stand 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/@WiebeSunSports", "http://blogs.canoe.ca/thebrawl/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-17T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:22:05.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
