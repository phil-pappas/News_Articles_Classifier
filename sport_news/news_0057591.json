They let me know that they were still interested in me and talking to me,\" Herbert explained. \"The past couple of weeks I've been talking to Coach Frost and (Thursday) he wanted me to call Coach Helfrich. Coach Helfrich filled me in with a scholarship.\"\nHerbert, a Ducks football season-ticket holder who thought his dream of a future in Eugene was over after his leg injury, accepted on the spot.\n\"It was really tough going through that, but I didn't really spend much time thinking about it,\" he said. \"I focused on getting back. Fortunately, I came back stronger. I'm really blessed and honored and fortunate to be in the position I am now. I've been a big Oregon Ducks fan my entire life. We have season tickets, so I used to go to every single game. It'd be just a great feeling running out in front of my friends, family and the city.\"\nAlthough Herbert's commitment would appear to indicate Oregon has three quarterbacks in its recruiting class, the Sheldon signal-caller said Green is no longer a Ducks pledge.\n\"I've been told he de-committed,\" he explained.\nHerbert chose Oregon over offers from Montana State, Nevada, Northern Arizona and Portland State.\nIt's been a dream of mine growing up, and I'm excited to announce my commitment to the University of Oregonüíöüíõüèà\n‚Äî Justin Herbert (@Justin_Herbert5) October 9, 2015\nOregon now has 13 commitments in the class of 2016:\n4* S Brady Breeze , 6-1, 200, Central Catholic HS (Portland, OR)\n4* ATH La'Mar Winston , 6-2, 210, Central Catholic HS (Portland, OR)\n4* CB Jared Mayden , 6-0, 195, Sachse High School (Sachse, TX)\n3* TE Cam McCormick , 6-5, 235, Summit HS (Bend, OR)\n3* OL Jacob Capra , 6-5, 270, Placer HS (Auburn, CA)\n4* WR Dillon Mitchell , 6-1, 190, White Station HS (Memphis, TN)\n4* QB Terry Wilson , 6-3, 190, Del City High School (Del City, OK)\n3* OLB Hunter Kampmoyer , 6-4, 235, Bishop Union HS (Bishop, CA)\n3* RB Vavae Malepeai , 6-0, 190, Mililani HS (Mililani, HI)\n4* LB Darrian Franklin , 6-1, 215, Downey HS (Downey, CA)\n3* OT Logan Bathke , 6-6, 260, Lutheran HS (Orange, CA)\n3* LB/S Troy Dye , 6-3, 205, Norco High School (Norco, CA)\nUnrated QB Justin Herbert, 6-5, 215, Sheldon High School (Eugene, OR)\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Justin_Herbert5/status/652331011284467712", "https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "http://sports.yahoo.com/ccc/football/recruiting/player-Darrian-Franklin-161367"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:30:51.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
