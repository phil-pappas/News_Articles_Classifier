He was 150 feet in the air, removing thousands of honeybees that had made the Central Business District’s Maritime Building their home. \n“When we started getting up there, we had to maneuver around the building and the lights. It was a little difficult,” Abadie said. “It was a little scary. It was exciting overall.” \nSo people asked, what happens to the bees? The CBD honeybees have a new home not a block off Lapalco Boulevard in Marrero, because in the bee business if you get the bees, you keep the bees. \n“We get to keep the bees and we get the honey production,” said Glenn Gueho. \nGueho of the Busy Bee Company has been doing it for 54 years. The 65,000 bees are in a side yard, a small part of the more than 6 million bees here. \n99.9 percent of the CBD bees are female, but of the 65,000, there is only one decision making queen. Is this home now? You never know. \n“That queen can say I don't like this. We had a four-bedroom house before, you tried to put me in a one-bedroom apartment. I don't like the color. And they can move,” Gueho said. “They are going to be working here in this orange grove, traveling at a five mile radius of the Marrero area, never going back downtown, because they're too far.” \nTo separate the honey in a spinner takes about a half an hour. The result is pure gold. \nNext year, they'd like to get 15 to 20 gallons out of their new family members. \nGueho said his phone has been ringing off the hook for more work from as far away as Kentucky, and for honey, too.
