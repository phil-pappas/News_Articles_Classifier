Oregon won 26-20. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) SEATTLE (AP) — Make it a dozen straight for the Ducks.Make it another year of misery for Washington being owned by its neighbors to the south.Oregon quarterback Vernon Adams, Jr. returned after missing the previous two games to throw for 272 yards and two touchdowns, and the Ducks (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) won their 12th straight over Washington 26-20 on Saturday night.Adams sat out Oregon's win over Colorado and double overtime loss to Washington State last week with an injured finger on his throwing hand. He returned just in time to give Washington (3-3, 1-2) even more nightmares.Adams was a thorn for the Huskies a year ago when he was still playing at Eastern Washington and threw for 475 yards and seven touchdowns on the Huskies.Under center for the first time since making a brief appearance against Utah on Sept. 26, Adams was back to tormenting the Huskies.Adams threw two touchdown passes to Darren Carrington, returning after missing the first six games of the season after failing an NCAA-administered drug test during the football playoffs last season. Adams hit Carrington for 36 yards on Oregon's first possession then capped the Ducks first drive of the second half with a 9-yard strike and a 23-6 lead.Adams finished 14 of 25 passing. Royce Freeman added 138 yards rushing and Bralon Addison added an 8-yard TD run.At times during the first half Adams showed rust after missing 2 ½ games. But he was nearly perfect when it counted most on third downs. Adams was 5 of 6 for 182 yards and a touchdown in the first half on third downs. It started immediately when he found Dwayne Stanford for 48 yards on third-and-7 on Oregon's first possession. Adams capped that drive with another third-down gem, hitting Carrington for 36 yards and a 6-0 Ducks lead.Adams added another third-down conversion to Carrington for 29 yards that led to Addison's TD run. Adams' best throw came on the final drive of the first half when he escaped the sack attempt of Elijah Qualls and hit Addison for 44 yards after cornerback Kevin King tripped. That conversion led to Aidan Schneider's 28-yard field goal and a 16-3 Oregon lead at halftime.Washington's Myles Gaskin broke free for a 72-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter to get the Huskies within 23-13, but Addison answered by returning the ensuing kickoff 87 yards to the Washington 9. Oregon failed to capitalize with Schneider missing a 32-yard field goal wide left, but he later hit from 24 for a 26-13 lead with 9:04 left.Washington pulled within 26-20 on Jake Browning's 3-yard TD pass to Jaydon Mickens with 3:35 remaining but the drive took nearly 5 ½ minutes and the Huskies had only one timeout remaining. Oregon converted one first down but Adams was incomplete on third down and the Ducks punted back to Washington at its 20 with 1:11 left.K.J. Carta-Samuels entered at quarterback with Browning apparently injured and was intercepted by Ugo Amadi with 24 seconds left.Gaskin finished with 155 yards rushing, but his long TD run was the only big play against an Oregon defense that had given up 530 yards to Utah and 641 last week to Washington State. Washington finished with 385 total yards and committed seven penalties in the first half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:27:41.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
