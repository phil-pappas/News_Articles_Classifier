However, we believe that we have the right manager to turn this season around and that he has the squad with which to do it.” \nMourinho has faced widespread criticism this season for his public spat with former club doctor Eva Carneiro and for Chelsea’s poor displays. \n“I define this as the worst period in my career,” he said on Friday. “It’s a fantastic experience, even though I don’t want to repeat it again.” — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:05:06.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
