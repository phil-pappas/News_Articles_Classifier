Dhopade's former coach Anup Deshmukh was the only IM from Vidarbha, before Dhopade joined his mentor a few years ago. \n\nIt was a long and painful wait for this shy Amravati youngster. He achieved three GM norms quite early but could not reach the magic figure of 2500 Elo points. His third norm was at CSK tournament in Chennai in January 2013. So he had to wait 33 months to touch Elo 2500. \n\nPune turned out to be the lucky venue for him. He won the first three games to start in brilliant fashion. If he had won the 4th he would have touched 2500 but he drew that game on Thursday. Before the 4th round, his live Elo was 2499.40. \n\nHowever, Friday turned out to be a day to remember for Dhopade. He won both games to cross the magical figure of Elo 2500. He played a whopping 336 games from the third norm to the title on Friday. \n\n\"It is a dream come true for me. Ever since I started playing chess, it was my dream to become GM one day in my life. It is an unbelievable feeling. I still cannot believe it. It is undoubtedly the happiest day of my life,\" said Dhopade, who is a senior clerk in Central Railways. \n\nIt was so near yet so far for Dhopade in the last couple of years. Even the thought of remaining only IM crossed his mind several times but he did not give up. \n\n\"It was all struggle and frustration for me in the last 2-3 years. I thought I would never become GM in my career. But support of my parents, coaches and friends helped me to carry on. The journey from IM to GM was a challenging one but the wait was worth it. I finally realized my goal. I can sleep well now. By getting this I have got a giant monkey off my back now,\" said Dhopade, who did his graduation in Commerce from KL College, Amravati. \n\n\"It feels great to become the first GM of Vidarbha. I would like to dedicate this achievement to my parents and my close relatives, who supported me in my tough times. I am grateful to my coaches Anup Deshmukh and Ramesh Sir of Chennai. They taught me many different things and took me to the next level. Anup Sir was a major guiding force. He also told me the importance of physical fitness and spirituality in life,\" said Dhopade, who celebrated his birthday on October 5 in Pune. \n\nIt was time for celebrations at Dhopade's Amravati home as soon as they got the much-awaited news from Pune. His parents are getting continuous phone calls from friends and relatives. \n\n\"I am ecstatic. I have no words to describe my happiness. After a long wait, Swapnil became GM. When he was down, we encouraged him and asked him to believe in himself. He is a fighter to the core and I am proud of my son,\" said Hema, Dhopade's mother, who works in the PWD department. \n\nFather Sunil Dhopade took voluntary retirement from Amravati Municipal Corporation a few years ago. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:58:05.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
