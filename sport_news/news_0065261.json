(Image Source: Steve Dykes/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at the Monday Night Football matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the Detroit Lions: \nSeries: Seahawks Lead 7-5; Streaks: Seahawks won 3 of past 4; Last Meeting: Lions 28, Seahawks 24 (10.28.12) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: ESPN (Mike Tirico, Jon Gruden & Lisa Salters) \nSpread: Seahawks -9 ½; O/U 43 \nInjury Report: Lions: Out: RB Joique Bell (ankle), TE Brandon Pettigrew (hamstring); Doubtful: LB DeAndre Levy (hip), OT Corey Robinson (ankle); Questionable: DE Ziggy Ansah (groin), OG Larry Warford (ankle), CB Josh Wilson (lower leg); Probable: DE Jason Jones (knee) \nSeahawks : Out: RB Marshawn Lynch (hamstring), DT Brandon Mebane (groin), CB Tharold Simon (toe), S Steven Terrell (hip); Questionable: DE Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder), LB Bruce Irvin (ankle), LB Kevin Pierre-Louis (knee); Probable: DE Michael Bennett (non-injury related), LB Mike Morgan (hamstring), LB Bobby Wagner (ankle), TE Luke Wilson (back), LB K.J. Wright (hip) \nWhere They Stand: After losing the first two games of the season, the Seattle Seahawks flexed their muscles in their home opener in Week 3, a 26-0 shutout of the Chicago Bears. With a win tonight, the Hawks can pull into a second-place tie with the St. Louis Rams, one game in back of the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC West. The Detroit Lions are still searching for their first win of the season and are in jeopardy of dropping four games behind the Green Bay Packers in the NFC North. With Baltimore, New Orleans and Chicago all winning this week, Detroit is the only winless team remaining in the NFL. \nThe Lions: Wracking up passing yards has never been an issue for the Lions, not with QB Matthew Stafford under center. The Georgia product is second in the NFL with 19,726 passing yards since 2011. Of course WR Calvin Johnson has a lot to do with that, as he’s averaging 103.4 receiving yards per game for a total of 6,413 receiving yards, the most in the NFL over the past four-plus seasons. WR Golden Tate will be playing against his former team. Drafted by the Seahawks in 2010, Tate has four TDs in his past four on MNF. Rookie RB Ameer Abdullah scored a receiving TD last week, making him one of two rookies with a rushing and receiving score this season. With RB Joique Bell out, expect to see Abdullah’s role expand if he can hang on to the football. Detroit’s defense will be without the services of LB DeAndre Levy for at least another week. That means more will be expected of veteran LB Stephen Tulloch , while DE Ziggy Ansah needs to generate a pass rush. Holding down the back end, S Glover Quin had an INT last week, giving him six in his past nine games. \nThe Seahawks: In his career, QB Russell Wilson is 4-0 on MNF with nine TD passes, no INTs and a 123.1 rating. Including the playoffs, Wilson is 27-2 at home as a starter. Seattle’s leading pass catcher WR Doug Baldwin (17 receptions) has scored in his past two MNF games at home. TE Jimmy Graham is coming on with seven grabs for 83 yards and a TD last week. He’s the Calvin Johnson of TEs, leading the position with 369 catches, 4,541 yards and 48 TDs (tied) since 2011. Rookie WR Tyler Lockett has been a special teams dynamo, becoming just the second rookie ever to score a PR-TD and a KR-TD in his team’s first three games. Without RB Marshawn Lynch expect a heavy dose of undrafted rookie Thomas Rawls , who is coming off his first career 100-yard game. DE Cliff Avril , who has 14 sacks in two-plus seasons with Seattle, started his career with the Lions. Backing him up are hard-hitting tacklers, LB’s Bobby Wagner (26 tackles) and K.J. Wright (23). Their most dangerous playmakers are in the secondary. S’s Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor form the top duo in the league, while CB Richard Sherman leads all players with 26 INTs since 2011. \nPrediction: With one of the toughest red zone defenses in the NFL (42.9 TD percent), the league’s best home-field advantage and a quarterback who doesn’t lose at home, the Seattle Seahawks will even their record at 2-2, while making the Lions the first four-loss team of 2015. \nScore: Seahawks 30, Lions 16 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
