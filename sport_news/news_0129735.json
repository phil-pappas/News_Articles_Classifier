This is a serious problem, and responsible policies to address it deserve serious consideration. To witness the frenzy at City Hall, however, is to recognize, once again, Portland's yawning leadership vacuum.\nWhat Portland needs is someone – ideally a mayor – willing to step back from the crisis du jour and urge colleagues and constituents to consider how specific proposals fit within the city's larger function. Portland needs to provide reasonably priced housing, to be sure. But it needs to do a lot of other things, too, like furnishing employment and meeting the needs of middle-class people, including those with blue-collar jobs.\nConsider from a middle-class perspective two of the housing-cost measures under discussion.\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms\nRead more about the editorial board's priorities for Oregon.\nFirst, to generate money for affordable housing, Commissioner Dan Saltzman would like to explore a fee on new housing . Saltzman, who oversees the Housing Bureau, says he's going to ask Council this month to fund a study that will \"look at how new development impacts the need for affordable housing.\" Such a study could be used to justify the imposition of a fee on new projects, which would be used to subsidize affordable housing.\nSecond, Hales wants to tax anyone who'd like to demolish a residential structure – even to build a new one in its place - $25,000. As of weeks ago, the tax was just that – a tax . But the latest iteration of the proposal allows property owners to collect rebates for building multiple units or affordable housing. Council will discuss the proposal Wednesday.\nCouncil's policy grab bag includes other things as well. There's a promise to spend millions to reduce homelessness. There's the declaration of a housing emergency and consideration of a renter-protection ordinance. The two revenue proposals stand out, however, because they purport to address an affordability problem by, paradoxically, adding taxes and fees to the thing that's already considered too expensive.\nThe rising cost of housing in Portland is not a new phenomenon, nor have city commissioners been unaware of their own role in driving prices upward and otherwise increasing the cost of living in the city. Just months ago, for instance, the Council narrowly approved a new method of calculating system development charges for parks . As a result, fees will jump significantly for new housing and business space. Saltzman, one of two commissioners to oppose the park methodology, said he did so in order to preserve \"room\" for an affordable-housing fee.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

Council is now poised to discuss Saltzman's housing fee and the mayor's huge demolition tax. Room? Who needs room? There's no need to set priorities, it seems, when you assume that Portlanders have a limitless tolerance for higher costs, including taxes for the arts, new taxes and fees for housing and – next year – the adoption of a 10-cent citywide gas tax.\nHales and his colleagues together have failed Portlanders not only by agreeing almost uncritically to the steady escalation of costs, but also by helping to limit employment opportunities. If you're going to pay more and more for housing and for living, it really helps to have a good job. But when the Portland Planning and Sustainability Commission's environmental requirements effectively killed the Port of Portland's effort to develop part of West Hayden Island – and provide badly needed employment – most commissioners shrugged. The mayor even declared himself \"comfortable\" with the result. As a sequel, Hales has tried to chase off Pembina Pipeline Corp. , which would like to invest hundreds of millions in a propane-export terminal at the Port. So much for those jobs, too. Did his colleagues rise up in protest? Hardly.\nBy failing to recognize how each successive tax or fee increase contributes to an affordability problem everyone claims to abhor; by refusing to support the creation of blue-collar jobs (and even chasing them away!), Hales and his colleagues have pushed the city further in a direction no one likes. The wealthy are, and will remain, relatively immune to rising housing costs. Low-income residents will benefit from any increase in housing subsidies. The middle-class will see higher costs and receive no subsidies. Portlanders who work in politically unpopular industries, meanwhile, will find few friends in City Hall.\nIronically, the mayor's demolition tax itself embodies the problem. It's supposed to preserve the availability of affordable housing stock, yet low-income Portlanders aren't likely to buy single-family homes in today's overheated market. Such \"affordable\" houses are, thus, not affordable to most of them in any case. High-income Portlanders are best able to shrug off a $25,000 tax to build the newer and better homes they want. The tax, instead, will weigh heavily on middle-income homeowners, who may thus decide not to embark upon projects that would support the jobs of people in the construction industry, some of whom have modest incomes. What Hales seeks is, in effect, a $25,000 tax on job creation dressed up as an affordable-housing initiative.\nHigher taxes and fees, missed employment opportunities and a hard-pressed middle class. With the right leadership, Portland could do much better.", "external_links": ["http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=50265&a=548229"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:08:41.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
