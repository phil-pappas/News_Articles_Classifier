Barrie and Walsh will be joined by reporter Marty Smith, ESPN.com college football writer Chris Low and ESPN.com columnist Mark Schlabach.The event is free and open to the public Saturday morning.

Parking is available in the Pendleton Street Parking Garage and at meters around campus. Portable restrooms are available in the parking lots behind Harper-Elliott and Pinckney-Legare and in front of the Russell House.The SportsCenter on the Road bus will arrive in Columbia on Friday, and SportsCenter will air a live segment Friday afternoon between 4 and 5 p.m. from Greene Street in front of the Russell House University Union during the final Homecoming Week event, called “There’s No Place Like Carolina Celebration.” Students are encouraged to wear garnet and attend the event, which will be held 4-5:30 p.m. It will showcase the university community and feature food and drinks, giveaways, community speakers, recognition of local first responders and UofSC volunteers who have helped with the recent flood relief efforts and a display of banners, photos, float displays and more from the Homecoming week.UofSC previously attracted ESPN's College GameDay to broadcast its three-hour show live from the Horseshoe preceding home games most recently in 2014 against Missouri, 2012 against Georgia and 2010 against Alabama. Carolina has hosted GameDay a total of seven times since 2001.The SportsCenter on the Road bus is a mobile production facility that carries the equipment needed for doing a SportsCenter broadcast at a remote location.

The show visited Notre Dame, Michigan, Boston College, St. John's (Minn.), Clemson and North Dakota State earlier this season. It also has originated in the last year from the NBA Finals, NFL Draft, Super Bowl and the College Football Playoff.SportsCenter debuted on ESPN's launch day (Sept. 7, 1979) and is the network's first and flagship show.
