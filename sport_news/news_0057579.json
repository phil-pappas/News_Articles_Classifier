The Aztecs practiced Wednesday afternoon with the Axe on the field as a reminder of the importance of the game, which also happens to be the team's Desert Sky League opener. The storied rivalry dates back to 1932, and the Aztecs lead the series 48-39-4. Silva has been a part of the rivalry on the playing and coaching end. Silva graduated from Barstow High in 1989. Silva, who was a middle linebacker, vividly remembers the Axe Game in 1988, despite the team having a terrible regular season record that year. “The Axe Game is my greatest memory of playing football,” Silva said. “In 1988 we only won two games that whole season. That year’s Axe Game was one of those victories and we did it at Victor and brought the Axe back to Barstow. That’s a night I’ll never forget because that win was that special to us.” Friday night’s Axe Game will be the 92nd game between the oldest schools in the High Desert. The Aztecs edged the Jackrabbits last year, converting a successful two-point conversion in the final minutes to take a 29-28 lead. An interception on the ensuing drive would seal the victory for the Aztecs. Barstow came up short in 2013, losing 31-24 in Silva’s first season as head coach. Silva is expecting another competitive game Friday night at Ray Moore Stadium. “Victor throws the ball well, they have a good running back and they are a very athletic team that is a threat to us,” Silva said. “We’re preparing for a tough game. The past two games have been very tight and we don’t expect anything less. Come Friday, records and rankings are put aside, none of that matters when these two teams meet.” The Aztecs enter the game ranked No. 8 in the most recent the CIF-Southern Section Eastern Division poll. Barstow is the second-ranked High Desert Team in the poll’s top 10, behind No. 3 Serrano. The Jackrabbits boast a 3-2 record and the Aztecs have a 5-1 record. Barstow is undefeated in four road games this season. “All that stuff is out the window,” Silva said. “This is our only rival game of the year. Victor has the Bell Game with Apple Valley, but there is so much history between us. What makes this game more significant is that we only have five teams in our league. That means only two teams are making the playoffs. This is a big game not just from the rivalry side, but you wanna start league play with a win.” By Jose Quintero", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:07:39.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
