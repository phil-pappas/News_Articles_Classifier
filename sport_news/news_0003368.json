Buzzfeed compiled a list of the 43 best “drunken eats” in college towns across the nation, and Tolly Ho came in at #24, with this quote from a Tolly Ho fan: “Open 24/7, famous for their Ho Burgers. Be sure to tell them if it’s your first time [because they will give you a welcome gift].” \n—Erin Eversole, Facebook \nConfession time: I’ve never been to Tolly Ho. Confession time x2: I’m really excited about that welcome gift when I get around to trying it. \nCheck out the entire list at Buzzfeed , and give my your favorite Tolly Ho menu item in the comments.

And they made a really good omelette. \n(I also really enjoyed saying “country fried ho” as often as I could… Blue October 21, 2015 at 11:42   \nHaven’t been since it moved, but I always went with a sausage and egg sandwich and tots.

No, I’m not one of them; I missed it by a couple of years, but I had older friends who still consider the first place the ONLY Tolly Ho. (Lexington Trivia fact: The Tolly Ho started in the same building later occupied by Pete’s Wok, and now by Kennedy’s Greek Shop.) \nMy claim to fame: Sandy and crew gave Milady and I a wedding shower at the Ho on Sunday, way back when they closed on Sundays. I spent several Sunday mornings helping clean and waiting for my songs to come around on the jukebox because the idiots played “I Would Do Anything for Love” 10000 times in a row. The Tolly Ho helped make at least half of the man I am today (certainly by pound, if no other measure). I can’t go very often any more (read the weight problem in the last sentence), but the whole family’s converging in a weekend or two to celebrate multiple birthdays. \nOK, NOW I feel old and depressed. Before I start yelling at people to get off my lawn, go to the Tolly Ho. And make sure to let them know it’s your first time. They’ll welcome you appropriately (just ask my parents….). \nSad fact of lists: Miami U is 3rd on the list with a bagel joint. Yes, a bagel joint. As drunken a party school as the place is (and Number One Son is going there, and complains about it enough), it’s a sad testament to how lame a city Oxford OH is that their only drunk eat places are a bagel joint and convenience stores. EconProf October 22, 2015 at 9:35 am | Permalink \nAs someone with two degrees from both Miami and UK, I have to say I have eaten at both–don’t knock Bagel Deli till you try it but honestly, it’s a better lunch eat than a drunk eat. There were plenty of good drunk eats in Oxford back in the day, things apparently have not changed for the better (according to your son.) Have to give the gut busting award to the Ho.

October 23, 2015 at 7:35 am | Permalink | Reply \nHey! I work at the Ho now and let me tell you, this website is right. It is the best drunk food you can buy here in Lexington. If you don’t know what you want, trust me, our front line girls will help you. My personal favorite is the ROAST sandwich. Sandy our prep lady cooks it slowly in a crockpot all day for us. It comes on a Ho bun with Must, Mayo, Slaw, BBQ sauce and a slice of Cheddars cheese. Trust me when I say this was the best sandwich the Owner has come up with! For a side? Can’t go wrong with Epic Fries or, since the cold weather has started, Epic Hash browns. A bed of either, topped with our Ho-made chili, cheese sauce, 4 pieces of baon crumbled, jalapeños, and sour cream. Don’t feel like eating, but you have a sweet tooth? We have cookies, brownies, sundaes, candy, milkshakes, and (seasonal) atm pumpkin pie. Need ChapStick? Want a pack of cigarretes? Need a Ho-shirt to take home with you? All these can be purchased in our Ho-Mart! All in all, our restaurant in top notch and a must try!
