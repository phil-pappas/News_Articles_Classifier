However, defensive coordinator Eric Mangini indicated Brooks could play. \n“It’s not something that’s definitive right now,” Mangini said. “So we’ll have to see how it goes at the end of the week.” \nBrooks, 31, who is away from the team, is a nine-year veteran who has made 73 career starts. Mangini was asked if Brooks could play Sunday if he didn’t practice during the week. \n“With this situation, we’ll just have to see how it goes at the end of the week,” Mangini said. “Obviously, all of our thoughts and prayers are with Ahmad. We’ll see how it goes. Knowing Ahmad and the way that he’s worked, he’s someone that I feel comfortable with being able to pick things up quickly and contribute. But completely secondary right now.” \nIf Brooks doesn’t play, rookie Eli Harold, a third-round pick, or Corey Lemonier, will make his first career start against the Giants. Lemonier has played 38 snaps this season. Harold has played 36. \nTwitter: @Eric_Branch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:21:58.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
