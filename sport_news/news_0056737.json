More \nAt a hearing Monday afternoon, the WPIAL board heard testimony from school administrators, coaches and referees. \nThe WPIAL accepted the punishments both schools handed down after the fight. New Castle High School suspended 13 players for one game and two coaches.The Central Valley School District suspended one player. \nThe WPIAL board decided further punishment was necessary. It ordered one year probation of for the New Castle team and a public censure of its coach, Joe Cowart. That means the New Castle Red Hurricanes will be under the microscope and will face harsher penalties if players or coaches violate any rules. \nThe board is also requiring both districts to develop sportsmanship protocols. The executive director of the WPIAL said violence is unacceptable, but, robust rivalries are a good thing. \n“We want that rivalry to continue,” said Executive Director Timothy O’Malley. “But in the continuance of the rivalry, we have an understanding of how it is that you compete against one another and the behavior you exhibit during the competition.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:57:46.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
