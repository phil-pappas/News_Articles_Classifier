To fill the void, Goforth had played cornerback while Tahaan Goodman took his spot at safety. That didn’t last.\n“It was just an opportunity for Randall to get back to where he feels more comfortable at a position,” defensive coordinator Tom Bradley said of the switch back. “Plus, his leadership back there, getting everyone lined up, helps us tremendously.”\nThe 5-foot-10, fourth-year junior had not played cornerback since he was at Long Beach Poly High, switching to safety not long after he arrived at UCLA as a freshman in 2012. So it’s a position he had grown accustomed to.\n“It felt good,” he said of returning to safety. “It helps me play all kinds of angles on the field, get back home to where I usually am, leading the guys back there and being more vocal as a safety.”\nWith Goforth at safety, Ishmael Adams is now a starting cornerback.\nAdams missed the first three games of the season when he was suspended for his arrest for allegedly using force to steal an Uber driver’s cell phone.\nHe returned for the Pac-12 opener against Arizona, but his start against Stanford was his first of the season.\nOn Monday, the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office charged Adams with misdemeanor battery, but he won’t be subjected to further discipline. Coach Jim Mora said Tuesday that Adams’ status with the team remains unchanged.\nThat gives the Bruins some semblance of continuity, especially needed as they prepare to face Cal quarterback Jared Goff on Thursday night.\nThe strong-armed Goff, a junior, is widely considered the Pac-12’s most talented passer and projected to be a high first-round pick in next spring’s NFL draft should he declare.\nIn six games this season, he has thrown for 1,970 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions, while completing 67 percent of his passes.\nEARLY IMPRESSIONS \nIn 2013, Cal coach Sonny Dykes faced the same quandary that UCLA coach Jim Mora dealt with this season. His most talented quarterback was a true freshman.\nIn his case, it was Goff. In Mora’s case, it was Josh Rosen. Both arrived early for spring practice, eagerly hoping to win the job.\n“You sit down, you look at them, they’re pretty similar in a lot of ways,” Dykes said.\nThe Golden Bears struggled that year, finishing 1-11, but Goff showcased his skills. He completed 60 percent of his passes for 3,488 yards, 18 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.\nThrough the midway point of this season, Rosen has completed 59 percent of his passes for 1,568 yards, 12 touchdowns and seven interceptions.\nDykes believes Rosen is on a similar track.\n“I think Josh has a big arm like Jared had,” Dykes said. “Josh is pretty far along developed physically. He’s a strong kid. He’s got good size. What makes those kids special is their demeanor.”\nDykes said he was impressed when Rosen visited Berkeley for a summer camp in high school.\nRosen considered attending Cal before committing to UCLA as a junior.\n“I think what allowed Jared to win the job as a freshman was his approach, his mental maturity, his ability to learn things quickly,” Dykes said. “Probably the most important thing is his ability to handle adversity. It seems like Josh has that certainly, looking from afar.”\nSTARKS QUESTIONABLE \nBackup running back Nate Starks left Thursday’s game at Stanford with a head injury and was not at practice Tuesday.\nIn five games this season, the sophomore has rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns, including the go-ahead score in a comeback victory over BYU.\nIt seems unlikely he will be able to play against Cal. Freshman Soso Jamabo would be next on the depth chart if Starks can’t go.\nUNIFORM CHANGES \nUCLA will wear all-black alternate uniforms Thursday night and the school is encouraging fans to wear black clothing to the game as part of a “black out.”\nPlayers will also wear pink ribbons on their helmets to support breast cancer awareness. About nine affected family members of players, coaches and staff members will be among the team’s honorary captains before the game.\nIt’s a cause close to Mora, who said his grandmother died of breast cancer, and his mother is a two-time survivor.\nContact the writer: jkaufman@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:55:29.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
