Looking at the top four teams [in the region], that's the team we would have picked to play. I'd rather go back to Winslow and settle that unfinished business there.” \nThe Mariners earned the opportunity to play Winslow with Saturday's exciting prelim playoff win over Nokomis. \nOceanside led 1-0 at halftime as VanBlarcom scored with 3:43 left. In the second half, Emily Pratt scored off a penalty corner for Nokomis with 12:58 remaining. \nTo decide the well-played, evenly-matched postseason affair, Allen tallied the game-winner with 1:19 left in the second overtime. \nOceanside held a 10-8 edge in shots, while Nokomis held a 14-4 advantage in penalty corners. \nMattie Hooper made six saves in the cage for Oceanside, while Alexis Mazurek made two crucial player-saves for the visitors. Chelsea Crockett made eight saves in goal for Nokomis. \nHooper played her second straight game for usual starter Lauren Hoppe, who remained out of action with concussion-like symptoms. Coach Hall said Hoppe should be back for the Winslow game, “but who knows?” \nThe hosts threatened to end the game in the second OT with three potentially dangerous penalty corners. \nThen came Allen's heroics, thanks, in part, to teammate VanBlarcom. And, of course, Allen's will to push herself physically to the limit to help her team — and herself — keep playing the game they love. \n“She took the ball at about the 50[-yard area of the field], got a pass from Makayla VanBlarcom, and Mary worked it in past the 25, moved a little to the right and shot toward the right across the circle and hit the far corner [of the cage],\" Hall said. \"I was actually really close to subbing for [Allen] because you could see that she was trying to make her legs move. But she found enough energy to finish the play and she just collapsed after that. She played the whole game for us. The will was there but her body was worn down a little bit.” Courier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:22:13.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
