Fans and former players have become increasingly frustrated and vocal, to the point where planes flying banners demanding Golden’s ouster have become a regular sight at Miami games.\nNot long after one of those planes flew over Doak Campbell Stadium on Saturday and before the Hurricanes’ 29-24 loss in Tallahassee, Miami athletic director Blake James said his evaluation of Golden’s performance would come at the end of the year.\nBut as Miami shifted its attention to Virginia Tech on Tuesday, the coach found himself – again – having to answer questions about his future and about the pressure put on college football coaches overall.\n“All I can do is speak for is myself. I love our team. I love coaching at the University of Miami and I love coaching our players,” Golden said Tuesday. “They give me a lot of energy every day to come to work and enjoy it and I think from that standpoint, that’s where my focus is. I don’t worry about all that. I’m not an Internet guy, I don’t read newspapers or listen to radio. My focus is on my 114 players, my staff and obviously my family at home. I don’t really have time for anything else. Trying to get our players to be the best they can be, trying to build a great team and a program, that’s where my focus is.”\n*Hurricanes receiver Stacy Coley , who had a career performance at Florida State, was named the ACC Receiver of the Week on Monday.\nColey, a junior from Northeast High, Coley had 139 receiving yards on seven catches. His 38-yard touchdown grab gave the Hurricanes a fourth-quarter lead against FSU and Tuesday, the receiver said he’s hopeful his performance is something to build on after dealing with a nagging hamstring injury all season.\n“I have to keep playing, try to make plays for my teammates, for the wide receivers, and for Brad,” Coley said. “Every time the opportunity comes, I have to go get it.”\nColey, who came down hard on his hip making that touchdown catch, said he has been getting treatment for that injury, as well as the hamstring, up to three times a day. He expects to play against Virginia Tech.\n*Through Miami’s first five games, one of the biggest issues remains finding consistency.\nThe Hurricanes have played well for long stretches, but will struggle either to start a game or in the case of the Nebraska game, late. Hurricane defensive coordinator Mark D’Onofrio said figuring out why consistency has been a problem has been a priority for the Hurricanes, who will face their first Coastal Division opponent on Saturday.\n“I wish I had an answer to that, but I know we’re searching hard,” D’Onofrio said. “I know that. It’s lineup or how we start the game, whatever it is, we’re working our tails off to be more consistent. Just like last week and the week before, we look at the positive things that we’re doing and I keep telling the guys, let’s enhance those things. Let’s not lose those things. We played well on third down. We did an awesome job in the red zone, big short yardage stop. Let’s catch fire. … let’s eliminate those things that are hurting us, the explosive plays. We didn’t give up a lot of explosive plays last year. We’re giving up too many right now. That’s really what we have to fix. If we fix that, we’re going to be okay.”\n*Receiver Braxton Berrios , who has dealt with a knee injury this season but has worked his way back into the lineup and had three catches for 34 yards against the Seminoles, said the Hurricanes have done their best to try and move forward after the FSU loss. But he admitted it was a challenge – one Miami has to overcome. The Hurricanes have struggled in each of the last two seasons after losses to the rival Seminoles, but they can’t afford to dwell on this particular heartache with seven ACC games left.\n“It’s not easy. It’s not something you just walk away from. It’s a consistent effort to stay focused on Virginia Tech, and that’s what we’re doing right now,” Berrios said. “You want fuel and that was it.”\n*Though center Nick Linder (shoulder/trapezius muscle) did not practice Monday, Golden said he was hopeful the offensive lineman would be available Saturday. The same goes for defensive tackle Kendrick Norton (ankle), who was held out for precautionary reasons.\n“[Nick] was close today, we held him out. I think he’ll be ready,” Golden said. “ Demetrius Jackson has a little cut on his foot that we’re dealing with, that’ll be kind of a day-to-day thing. I think [Norton] will be okay. [He had a little bit of an ankle sprain, but he seemed good. We held him, Nick and Demetrius out today. I think they’ll be okay long-term.”\n College Football Miami Hurricanes Florida State Seminoles Virginia Tech Hokies Randy Edsall", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d9149/turbine/sfl-ums-al-golden-i-love-coaching-at-the-university-of-miami-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:33:09.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
