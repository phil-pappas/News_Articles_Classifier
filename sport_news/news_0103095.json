The closest other such market is located in Tanasbourne .\nErtman said Walmart is hiring between 90 and 95 part- and full-time employees. People can apply for those jobs at a temporary hiring center at 135 N.E. 43rd Ave. in Hillsboro, at other Walmart stores or online , Ertman said.\nThe Hillsboro Argus/OregonLive has previously reported that the market will be 50,000 square feet and is part of a development dubbed \"Sequoia Village.\" The development, according to the report , will also include two smaller retailers and 157 townhouses.\nErtman said she's excited to open the market and get to know the people of Hillsboro.\n\"That community feel is what we're looking for,\" she said.\nâ€” Jim Ryan\njryan@oregonian.com\n503-221-8005; @Jimryan015", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jimryan015", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/W+Baseline+Rd+%26+SW+Cornelius+Pass+Rd,+Hillsboro,+OR+97124/@45.5158004,-122.9011155,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54950fbc58164a31:0xff565df280d8ac02", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/135+NE+43rd+Ave,+Hillsboro,+OR+97124/@45.5206283,-122.9404889,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x54950ff090e34a49:0x7b13b4dd097da5ca", "https://www.google.com/maps/search/walmart+neighborhood+market/@45.4848139,-122.8383017,11z/data=!3m1!4b1", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Walmart+Neighborhood+Market/@45.5357137,-122.854908,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x54950f4797a4b8c1:0x6aca2b59f2553381", "http://careers.walmart.com/", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1397.8578754440668!2d-122.90111548334461!3d45.51580039166615!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x54950fbc58164a31%3A0xff565df280d8ac02!2sW+Baseline+Rd+%26+SW+Cornelius+Pass+Rd%2C+Hillsboro%2C+OR+97124!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1445034393406"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:43:32.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
