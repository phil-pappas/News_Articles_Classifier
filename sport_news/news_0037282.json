We had three players coming back from significant injuries.\n\"We have had so many contributors this year that one inning in a set of three games will not define our season.\n\"One game, one inning, a set of three will not define what these group of guys were capable of doing this year.\"\nWith starter Cole Hamels keeping the Blue Jays in check for 6-1/3 innings the Rangers looked in control taking a 3-2 lead into the bottom of the seventh.\nBut Texas self-destructed with a run of three consecutive errors, including two by Elvis Andrus.\nAfter Josh Donaldson hit a single to score Kevin Pillar to tie the game at 3-3, slugger Jose Bautista slammed a three-run homer into the second deck.\n\"Look, one inning won't define who this ball club is and who they've been all year long,\" said Banister. \"Challenging and I hurt for them.\n\"Cole (Hamels) did what he needed to do. We failed to make a couple plays behind him. We talked about it, the team that makes mistakes is going to be in trouble, bottom line.\n\"We are not a perfect ball club, by any stretch of the imagination, but what we do is we go out and play hard every single day. We show up for each other.\n\"We won the American League West when nobody thought we would do anything in the game of baseball.\n\"I'm most proud of how those guys played all year long, and how they showed up.\"\n(Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:10:10.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
