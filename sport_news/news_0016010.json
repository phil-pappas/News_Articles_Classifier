(Jim Middlekauff | lehighvalleylive.com contributor) \nAll week before Saturday’s Wilson at Pen Argyl Colonial League football game, everyone connected with both teams knew what would be the decisive factor – controlling the line of scrimmage. \nThe Green Knights’ defensive line fought the Warrior offensive line to, roughly, a draw. \nBut Pen Argyl’s offensive line decisively handled its Wilson foes, as the Green Knights’ 337 rushing yards showed. \nSo the Green Knights won the battle up front, on the whole, and thus not surprisingly won the game, 49-28, to delight a huge Homecoming crowd at Alumni Stadium. \nTake a bow, junior tight end Joey DePaolo, sophomore tackle Blake Fox , junior guard Dawson Hughes , junior center Tanner Barr , junior guard Vince Incalcaterra, and senior tackle Jake Sutton -- especially Sutton, whose play rose to all-league levels, and Barr, the glue in the middle who owned the space around him. (And notice all but one are back next year -- good news for Green Knight fans. \nPen Argyl sophomore running back Logan Sterner, who ran for 263 of those yards and a school-record-tying five touchdowns, loved what the beef up front did for him. \n“I couldn’t stop thanking the line for all they did for me,” he said. “The line was giving me all the space I needed. The holes were there all day. The line did great.” \nBarr said it was a matter of establishing physical superiority. Pen Argyl jumped to a 12-0 lead on two run-dominated drives. \n“I think those two big drives showed they couldn’t stop us at the line of scrimmage,” Barr said. “We had a lot of guys coming off the ball really well. We knew we could put points on the board running the ball with talented guys like Logan running the ball. And there’s nothing better for an offensive lineman than when we’re driving the ball running the way we were.” \nPen Argyl coach Paul Reduzzi liked it when a plan came together. \n“We thought the running game would be there for us today,” he said. “The kids really responded to us pushing to run the ball.” \nBarr said the line’s energy levels were the best of the season. \n“We had a lot of energy today,” he said. “I think it came from being 0-7 and really needing to win, and playing at home with the crowd.” \nAnd winning a battle that had to be won for Pen Argyl to be successful at last.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:17:09.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
