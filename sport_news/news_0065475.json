Facebook Some Lincoln High School students are pushing back against a plan by Denver Public Schools to open a charter middle school on the LHS campus, located in southwest Denver. A protest organized by the community group Padres y Jovenes Unidos is scheduled for 5 p.m. tonight in advance of a 6 p.m. public comment session being held by the DPS school board.\n\"The school board, the community and the students agree there is a need for a high-quality middle school in the southwest,\" says Karissa Frolov, a youth organizer with the Denver-based group. \"But there are ways to go about it. You can't just put a middle school here and say, 'Let's see how it works.'\"\nThe DPS plan calls for adding a branch of the high-performing DSST charter school network at Lincoln in the 2017-2018 school year. The school would actually open the year before but would be \"incubated\" at an existing DSST school for a year before moving to Lincoln. There are already six DSST middle schools and three DSST high schools in DPS. All nine are charter schools that focus on STEM education, which stands for science, technology, engineering and math.\nMiddle schoolers in southwest Denver need better schools, DPS officials say: 47 percent of the area's sixth graders are enrolled in under-performing schools, according to a presentation by district staff to the school board last week. By comparison, the district's existing DSST schools perform very well — and officials hope that a new DSST middle school at Lincoln would do the same.\nRelated Stories Obama touts his jobs plan at Lincoln High School in Denver (PHOTOS) Denver Public Schools But some community members are worried that adding a middle school at Lincoln will be detrimental to a high school they say is already overcrowded and lacking key resources. In a recent survey of more than 600 Lincoln students, 85 percent said they've been late to class because of overcrowding in the hallways and 92 percent said they've experienced long waits to get lunch. The survey was organized by students, some of whom spoke at a recent school board meeting in opposition to the plan.\n\"It just doesn’t make any sense to the students,\" Frolov says of the plan, which involves phasing in the middle school to add a total of 450 middle school students to the Lincoln campus by the 2018-2019 school year. \"Where are they going to put them?\"\nDPS officials say there's plenty of room. Lincoln has a capacity of 2,100 students but it hasn't been full for years — and the district predicts that the student population will shrink even more by 2018-2019. “As Lincoln becomes smaller, it creates the space for the additional students,\" Susana Cordova, DPS's chief of schools, said at a recent school board meeting . She denied that adding a middle school at Lincoln was the first step toward eventually closing the high school altogether.\nDenver Public Schools \"We are very committed to ensuring that Lincoln continues, that it has high-quality educational opportunities for students and that it needs to be fed by very strong middle schools across the board,\" she said. \"We have made the commitment that we will never turn students away from Lincoln.”\nBut not everyone is convinced. The slogan of the campaign opposing DPS's plan? Fix Lincoln First.\nThe school board is expected to vote on the plan on Thursday.\nContact: Melanie Asmar Follow: Melanie Asmar @MelanieAsmar Westword Westword", "external_links": ["http://lincolnlancers.org/", "http://www.boarddocs.com/co/dpsk12/Board.nsf/files/A35D6Z7706A9/%24file/BOE_2015%2010%208%20FAP%20SW_FINAL.pdf", "http://livestream.com/dpstv22/events/4409762", "https://www.facebook.com/DenverWestword", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Melanie-AsmarWestword/162305260526475", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205181382914319&set=pb.1237765555.-2207520000.1444674452.&type=3&theater", "http://www.dsstpublicschools.org/", "https://twitter.com/MelanieAsmar", "http://www.twitter.com/denverwestword"], "published": "2015-10-12T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:15:13.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
