The Shrimps took the lead in the 42nd minute thanks to an error from goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan. Tom Barkhuizen's cross from the right was deflected goalwards by Crawley defender Lewis Young, but Flahavan dropped the ball onto the head of home striker Kevin Ellison who bundled home his second goal of the season from two yards out.The home side added a second on 65 minutes when the in-form Shaun Miller scored his seventh goal in the last five games with a fine piece of individual play. The Crawley defence hesitated and Miller nipped in to create an opening before drilling a low shot past Flahavan from eight yards out.Crawley hit back with Rhys Murphy clipping the crossbar with a superb effort from the edge of the area and Shamir Fenelon seeing an effort cleared off the line by Aaron McGowan after a weaving run into the Morecambe box, before they reduced the arrears five minutes from time.Mitch Hancox delivered a fine cross from the left which Morecambe goalkeeper Barry Roche could only parry into the path of Murphy, who made it two in two games.However, any hopes Crawley had of a comeback were dashed in stoppage time when they conceded a sloppy penalty. Hancox caught Aaron Wildig in the box and substitute Paul Mullin sent Flahavan the wrong way from the spot for his fifth goal of the season.
