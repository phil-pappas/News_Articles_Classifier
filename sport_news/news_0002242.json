Game: Pebblebrook (3-3, 1-2) at East Coweta (5-1, 2-1)Last year: East Coweta 41, Pebblebrook 7All-time series: East Coweta leads 5-0Prediction: East Coweta 35, Pebblebrook 14For the first time in a while, Pebblebrook has a chance to win back-to-back region games. Tonight in Sharpsburg, the Falcons will face East Coweta and try to reach the .500 mark in Region 3 .The task will be challenging since East Coweta is in the running for a region title and refocused after its first loss of the season, a 29-21 setback to Langston Hughes.“They’ve got a really good football team,” Pebblebrook coach Kevin Saunders said. “The quarterback is exceptional. He throws the ball well and runs the ball well. I think they will be the best football team we have faced so far this year.”The Indians have already outscored two Cobb County teams (Harrison and Campbell) 52-16 this season. In those two wins, quarterback Will LaGuardia scored four touchdowns and running back Devonte Brown added three.Like Pebblebrook, East Coweta also runs the Wing-T offense, but the Indians are more familiar with it.“They run a lot more stuff out of their Wing-T than we do because they are very comfortable doing it,” Saunders said. “We don’t throw it as much as they do. We are still in the early part of learning this offense.”Even though the Falcons (3-3, 1-2) don’t have as much experience on offense and defense, they have still managed to win half of their games, including a 27-6 triumph over Campbell last week which ended a 10-game region losing streak.“We are further along than I thought we would be,” Saunders said. “As far as wins are concerned, if you would’ve told me we would be 3-3 after six games, I would have taken it. But we’ve still got a ways to go and are trying to build on everything.”Against Campbell, Gianni Montgomery ran for two touchdowns and J’uan Weary returned an interception for a touchdown in the Falcons’ first region win since 2013.The last time Pebblebrook won back-to-back region games was during the 2011 season.“We know we got our hands full and our kids are excited about the challenge,” Saunders said. “That is part of being a competitor. You like playing these types of games so we will see how it goes.”— By Maurice DixonGame: Campbell (2-4, 0-3) at Newnan (4-2, 2-1), 7:30 p.m.Last year: Newnan 35, Campbell 7All-time series: Newnan leads 5-0Prediction: Newnan 28, Campbell 14Campbell put emphasis on strength and conditioning and it showed during the preseason and the non-region portion of the schedule. The returning players are bigger and faster than a year ago, and that helped the Spartans win their first two games.Then the injuries started to occur. Campbell is missing starters on the offensive line, and several more on the defensive front seven. Without much depth to work it, the Spartans’ options became limited. Campbell will attempt to end its four-game losing streak tonight at Newnan. A win on the road will also help the Spartans bounce back from a tough loss to Cobb County rival Pebblebrook last week. The team is also searching for its first Region 3 victory.“We have a severe injury bug but told the kids we have to continue on,” Campbell coach Ryan Brady said. “No one is going to feel sorry for us. We have to be the best team that we can be and go out there and compete.”The Spartans have no intentions of giving up on the season but are at the point where they’re evaluating a lot of their younger talent and players who can play both ways. Against Newnan, Brady said he’s also putting together schemes that best suits the talent he has and putting players in positions where they can have success.Newnan is coming off a tough region loss to Westlake where it had an early two-touchdown lead. The Spartans will have to keep watch on quarterback Chancellor Johnson, who is a dual-threat for the Cougars.— By Adam Carrington", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:11:08.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
