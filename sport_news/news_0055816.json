LOUIS — Branch Rickey's unwritten rules of baseball etiquette may have been violated Saturday at Busch Stadium when Cardinals pinch-hitter Randal Grichuk burst out of the dugout to take a curtain call.\nGrichuk's pinch-hit home run in the fifth inning of Game 2 of the National League Division Series had cut the Cardinals' deficit to three runs in a 6-3 loss to the Cubs that tied the series at one game apiece.\nCurtain calls usually are reserved for big moments, and though it certainly was nice for Grichuk, it did not meet the minimum standards required for running out of the dugout and taking a bow.\nI'm not sure what page the rule is on because I've never seen the book, but former Cubs catcher John Baker called him out, tweeting that 2015 is \"the Year the Cardinal devalued the curtain call.\"\nIt appeared as though the Cardinals were grasping at straws in their attempt to fire up a crowd that had just awakened from a nightmare they never thought possible.\nThe Cubs used the Cardinals Way to fuel a five-run second inning, scoring two of their runs on safety squeeze bunts, just as Tony La Russa frequently did during his 16-year tenure managing the team.\n\"Everything has to be set up properly for that,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"I mean, that happens every so often, I guess a harvest moon, possibly.\"\nCubs breakdown for Game 2 Mark Gonzales and Paul Sullivan break down the Cubs' 6-3 win in Saturday's Game Two.\nMark Gonzales and Paul Sullivan break down the Cubs' 6-3 win in Saturday's Game Two.\nSee more videos In that case, there must have been a lot of harvest moons during Cubs-Cardinals games in the past. The Cubs were usually on the wrong end of the squeeze play, like a game at Busch in 2005 when David Eckstein pulled off a suicide squeeze straight back to pitcher Sergio Mitre that brought home catcher Hector Luna with the winning run in the 11th inning.\nManager Dusty Baker said the Cubs \"knew they were probably going to squeeze, we just didn't know when.\"\nThe Cardinals knew Saturday what was coming in the second when starter Kyle Hendricks showed bunt with runners on first and third and one out, but Hendricks still brought home Austin Jackson home with a bunt back to pitcher Jaime Garcia.\n\"In the postseason, it is the small things that win ballgames,\" Hendricks said. \"I just got it down, luckily, and whatever decision they made on defense, it worked out to our advantage. It's big. You have to be able to do those things.\"\nAddison Russell, who had one sacrifice in 523 plate appearances this season, followed in similar fashion, bringing home Miguel Montero to give the Cubs a 2-1 lead. Russell admitted he only started practicing his bunting last week.\nRussell also made a sensational play to rob Jhonny Peralta leading off the Cardinals second, showing the range that already has made him one of the game's best defensive shortstops. He dived to his right, bounced up and fired a bullet to first to nail Peralta.\n\"That was huge, especially coming back on the field in that big inning,\" Russell said. \"If he gets a hit, maybe the intensity (shifts) toward them and they create some momentum.\"\nHendricks marveled at the rookie's Ozzie Smith impersonation.\n\"If that's not No. 1 on the Top 10 list, I don't know what is,\" he said. \"He has been making plays for me all year. He's such an unbelievable athlete. He can play some shortstop, I know that.\"\nIt was that kind of a day, one that started with the Cubs blowing off batting practice, which Maddon said was optional.\n\"It wasn't optional,\" Dexter Fowler said. \"It was no b.p.\"\nNo b.p.?\n\"Yeah, no b.p.,\" Anthony Rizzo said. \"It was nice.\"\nBut Maddon said it was optional.\n\"Yeah, it was optional,\" Rizzo said with a laugh. \"Just no one took it. Everyone took the option not to take it.\"\nThe thing about this team is it enjoys doing nothing. They're baseball nihilists, immune to pressure.\n\"The hype is up, and we play into that,\" Russell said. \"We like the intensity, and we bring intensity each time we step in the field. That's just the type of guys I think we have. It's good to have.\"\nNow the Cubs go home to try to finish this thing off the next two games. Rizzo said the atmosphere at Wrigley Field on Monday should be electric.\nJust remember, curtain calls are optional.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Joe Maddon Jhonny Peralta National League", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619ce92/turbine/ct-cubs-breakdown-20151010", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619d346/turbine/ct-cubs-win-cardinals-way-sullivan-spt-1011-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-11T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:13:13.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
