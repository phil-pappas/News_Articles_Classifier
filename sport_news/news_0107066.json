I wish we could have played them -- or the Spurs (could have played the Warriors) -- but they still were the best team. They earned it.\"\nRivers, in comments published Tuesday in Grantland, made reference to the Warriors not having to face in the Western Conference finals the Clippers, who were eliminated in the semifinals by the Houston Rockets.\n\"You need luck in the West,\" Rivers told the website. \"Look at Golden State. They didn't have to play us or the Spurs. But that's also a lesson for us: When you have a chance to close, you have to do it.\"\nTold Rivers said the Warriors got lucky not having to play the Clippers or Spurs, Warriors guard Klay Thompson fired back Friday.\n\"Didn't they lose to the Rockets? Exactly,\" Thompson said. \"Haha. That just makes me laugh. That's funny. Weren't they up 3-1, too? Yeah, tell them I said that. That's funny, man. That's funny.
