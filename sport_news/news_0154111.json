Not even 10 minutes have passed and things were already looking very bad. \n\"A start like this from us is unacceptable; if we want to fight for big things we must learn the lesson as soon as possible. The only thing I can say is that we shouldn't play a game like this again. \n\"We tried to get back into the game, fighting until the end, but obviously we were penalised by our horrible start. \n\"Unfortunately, that was the end of a good month of September. \n\"Earlier in the week we had won against Wolfsburg in the Champions League, coming from one goal behind, and the team was feeling good before the international break, but then we had those horrible 20 minutes. \n\"Now we must carry on, as I said before, and play like we were doing in previous weeks. \n\"We must learn from this defeat. We have an important month of October ahead, with games that will demand our best level of performance, and we have to be ready for them.\" \nMata added: \"We still are in the top spots of the table and this is a long-distance race, we are sure of that. All the teams are finding difficulties, but we remain hopeful that we can achieve something important this season, and that's what we are working for every week.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:02.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
