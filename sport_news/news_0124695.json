Mark J. Rebilas / USA TODAY Sports FOX Sports Updated Oct 11, 2015 at 9:33p ET \nWith Sunday's 30-6 win at Dallas, the New England Patriots are now 4-0 and sitting comfortably at the top of the AFC East. Since they're undefeated and looking like world-beaters, comparisons to the high-scoring 2007 team that went 18-1 are natural. \nIt's a long season, and the Patriots are only a quarter of the way through it, but quarterback Tom Brady is on his Deflategate revenge tour and has the offense firing on all cylinders. In fact, the offense is playing so well that the Sunday's 30-6 win at Dallas helped the Patriots break a franchise record for most points scored through four games â€” previously held by the Pats' 2007 team. \nThe 2015 Patriots have scored 149 points in four games, edging the 2007 team's record by just one point. Brady and the offense are averaging 37.3 points per game, which is good for second in the league. If they keep up this pace, the 2015 Patriots and 2007 Patriots will be linked for weeks to come.
