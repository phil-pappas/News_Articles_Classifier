Tattoo artists from around the country are attending the three-day event, showcasing a wide variety of styles.\nA great way to see some amazing work is to attend the daily competitions. Here, inked art is judged by category, such as \"Best Large Tribal,\" \"Best Back Color\" and \"Best Traditional Small.\"\nThe \"Best of Day\" tattoo competition recognizes the best work created in a single day at the show, and is held each evening. Friday night's winner in this category was Kendall Marr of Sherwood, created by Kane Navasard of Orange County, California. The piece is a memorial to Marr's father.\nThe expo continues on Saturday and Sunday, with the \"Best of Show\" category being announced on Sunday evening.\n-- Kristyna Wentz-Graff\n@kwgphoto", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:34:57.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
