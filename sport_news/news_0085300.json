Photo: Tom Reel / San 24 of 24 NBA scouts not sold on Spurs 1 / 24 Back to Gallery Sports Illustrated spoke to NBA scouts — scouts scouting anonymously like it's a matter of national security — ahead of the season to get their take on each team.\nThe Spurs enter the season as one of the favorites to capture an NBA title, but the nameless prognosticators are worried about some potential weaknesses.\nHere are some responses and rebuttals to what they had to say.\n\"He and Tim Duncan remind me of [David] Robinson and Duncan. I wouldn't be surprised if Pop [Gregg Popovich] goes back to some of the stuff they ran back then. There will not be as much of an emphasis on three-point shooting. They will work the elbows, do a lot to get the ball into the post.\" Splitter grew into a valuable role player during his time in San Antonio, but he was always the fourth or fifth offensive option on the floor.\nHis post game wasn't Kendrick Perkins-level atrocious, but Splitter was never typically one to aggressively search for shots.\nNow, he's been replaced with one of the best shooting big men in the NBA, a near 7-footer who stretches the floor, making his defender uncomfortable at all times.\nThirty-six percent of Aldridge's shots came from 16-24 feet away from the basket, and his confidence behind the arc has continued to become a bigger part of his game each year.\nRELATED: Aldridge hopes to make AT&T Center home\nDuncan and Aldridge both like to populate the post, but Aldridge works almost exclusively from the left side of the floor.\nDuncan doesn't step out too much anymore. He operates deep in the post and up around the elbows — even the patented Timmy bank has seen a reduction in recent years, though he's as efficient as he's ever been, even nearing 40.\nDuncan and Aldridge are both intelligent passers at their position in an offense where ball movement is the first commandment, and their acumen should contribute to some beautiful basketball once the team moves past the awkward first date stage.\n\"You see some miles on David West... I thought getting another stretch four would have been a priority.\" David West isn't David Love or Ryan Anderson, but to say he can't stretch the floor is a bit of stretch itself.\nForty-five percent of West's shots came within that 16-24-foot range that defines Aldridge as a floor-stretching big.\nWest rarely steps out for a three — just 20 total attempts last year — but he's efficient and effective from away from the paint. West shot 50.2 percent from the land of LA, whereas Aldridge shot 41.6 percent.\nThe Spurs may lose a three-point threat when Aldridge needs a blow, but West is more than capable of stepping out and taking opposing forwards, especially those of the plodding variety, out of their comfort zone. And when he wants to bully you down low, you better believe he'll tango in the paint, too.\n\"Tony Parker needs to have his minutes cut. Point guard is such a tough position in the West; it's harder for him to be consistent. He still shoots a good percentage but he forces a lot of shots.\" It's difficult to argue against Parker's decline given his performance over the past 12 months.\nLast season was Parker's worst since he was a fledgling rookie from France. His points, assists, minutes and rebound numbers were all either the worst or second-worst of his career.\nHe still posted a league-average shooting percentage in the paint, but his ability to get there has greatly diminished.\nParker's greatest strength has always been an uncanny ability to slither into the teeth of the defense and convert at an elite rate; the guy on the court simply isn't as capable of that anymore.\nHis terrible Eurotrip travails this summer were well-documented, and his preseason struggles haven't proved encouraging.\nRELATED: Parker searching for place in Spurs' new-look offense\nOn any given night Parker can see Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Eric Bledsoe, Mike Conley, Damian Lillard or Ricky Rubio. That doesn't even include John Wall and Kyrie Irving and the rest out east.\nThere aren't too many nights you can loosen up on the defensive end of the floor when you're an NBA point guard, and for a player like Parker with 1,211 NBA games and nearly 40,000 in-game minutes on the odometer, any respite is a necessary relief.\n\"Danny Green is 0 for 6 or 5 for 6. You don't know what you are going to get from him. He gets away with being an O.K. defender because they have great team defense.\" \"They didn't replace Marco Belinelli, so there's a lot of pressure on Green and Kawhi Leonard to carry them from three-point range. Maybe Jimmer Fredette will step up and be Stephen Jackson this year.\" An overarching theme among scouts is concern with the Spurs' three-point shooting.\nRELATED: The end of Jimmer Mania\nBelinelli is one of the game's preeminent floor-stretchers, but he's kickin' it with George Karl in Sactown and there's really no one on the bench that can replicate his shooting on their own (R.I.P. Jimmer).\nBut the scouts might be buying too much stock in Green's preseason struggles.\nYes, he's shot just 2-of-9 from three, but it seems unfair to emphasize a nine-shot sample size over last year.\nGreen hit 191 threes last year and converted at a 41.9 percent clip. Every team in the NBA coverst a three-and-D player like Green — he's not the problem.\nThe problem is everyone else.\nAldridge has continued his efforts working away from the paint, but dude was still a 35.2 percent shooter on 1.5 attempts last season.\nParker has never been a downtown marksman; his 42.7 percent shooting last year feels like an aberration, and he's unlikely to take much more than the 1.3 he attempted.\nBoris Diaw is streaky. Same goes for Patty Mills.\nMuch of the Spurs long-distance hopes are in the gargantuan hands of Kawhi Leonard, who has displayed an increased tendency to launch from deep.\nRELATED: Is Kawhi Leonard really the NBA's best defender?\nThe reigning Defensive Player of the Year is expanding his offensive arsenal, and if his preseason numbers stick — 9-of-20 shooting (45%) from three — this starting lineup could go super nova.\n\"He shows you the unexpected. He emphasizes defense and doesn't allow any slippage. [But] what sets him apart is managing an entire season. He sees the big picture.\" The one thing everyone can agree on?\nPops is a hell of a coach.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824263/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824258/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824275/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824261/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824263/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824256/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824266/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/15/8827720/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/53/8833733/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824259/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824275/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824266/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824264/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824268/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824272/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824261/21/920x920.jpg", "http://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/Parker-searching-for-place-in-Spurs-new-look-6568974.php", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824273/27/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824264/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824258/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824271/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824272/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824265/21/920x920.jpg", "http://www.si.com/nba/2015/10/20/nba-scouts-preview-warriors-spurs-knicks-lakers-cavaliers-rockets", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824273/27/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/53/8833736/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/53/8833733/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/53/8833734/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/53/8833734/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824269/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/15/8827720/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/53/8833736/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824265/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824274/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824267/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824270/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824271/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824268/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824270/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824276/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824256/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824267/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824259/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824260/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824260/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824276/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824269/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824274/21/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:54:28.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
