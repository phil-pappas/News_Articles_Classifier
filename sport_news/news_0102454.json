But the house comes with a warning to potential buyers: It may be booby-trapped.\nThe Browns held authorities at bay in a nine-month standoff. They're in jail now serving at least 30 years. And the government wants to unload the couple's fortress-like home in Plainfield, New Hampshire.\nNow, bidders can get a tour of the property, complete with hidden doors and passageways, a turret and an underground bunker. But bidders are warned that explosives have been found on the property.\n\"They can't guarantee that they have found everything, but they have done a good faith search over and over again,\" said Roger Sweeney of the IRS.\nThe house is 6,000-square feet. The property is 100 acres. The auction will be held Oct. 22. Click here for more information.\nThis is the second time federal authorities have tried to sell the home. It hit the auction block about a year ago, but there weren't any bidders. This time, the starting bid has been cut from $250,000 to $125,000.", "external_links": ["https://www.treasury.gov/auctions/irs/conh_real_8031.htm"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:32:10.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
