Tickets for adults will increase from five dollars to eight dollars. Tickets for students and seniors will drop from three dollars to two dollars. \nDeclining revenue for the NJSIAA at Rutgers was a driving force behind the original move to Toms River. \n“The new pricing structure will allow NJSIAA to stay at Rutgers this year, but does not allow us to attain projected revenues and make a long-term commitment to the venue,” Timko added. “We continue to work with the Commissioner of Education and with Senator (Raymond) Lesniak, who has been in discussions with all parties about keeping the games at Rutgers. We remain hopeful that we'll be able to transition from a net-loss to a more economically sustainable event.” \nContacted by NJ Advance Media by phone on Monday, Lesniak said he was pleased that the issue had been resolved for this year and that he expects a long-term solution to be found as well. \n\"I'm certainly pleased because I was concerned this high school tournament was not going to be held at Rutgers, the state university, which is a great benefit to both the high schools and the university and the fans who like to watch the games. All I did was impress upon the parties to make every effort to bring the games back to the RAC,\" Lesniak said. \"I'm certain it will be resolved (going forward), we resolved it for this year and going forward I think everyone is going to be comfortable with the tournament staying at Rutgers permanently.\" \nThe move from Rutgers to Pine Belt Arena was met with political opposition, with Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) speaking out especially. \n“It’s the state university — the game should be played there,” Burzichelli said back in August . “This is ridiculous. It’s not about raising ticket prices; it’s about getting the event done. The university should participate to a greater extent if necessary because these are our public schools and this is our state university.” \nJeremy Schneider may be reached at jschneider@njadvancemedia.com .
