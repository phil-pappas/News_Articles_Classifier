Five states have prohibited them from operating, but none is as powerful and influential as Nevada, which has long been the bastion of legal gambling and operates under some of the nation’s strictest regulation. Nevada also seemingly has most to lose; its casinos have lacked the ability to stretch across state lines on the Internet, as daily fantasy sites have. The Nevada commission said operators of the state’s sports books may offer daily fantasy games if they wanted, but warned about its associations. “Although Nevada gaming licensees who have received approval to operate a sports pool may expose DFS for play themselves in Nevada (in compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations), such licensees should exercise discretion in participating in business associations with DFS operators that have not obtained Nevada gaming approvals” the group said in a statement. “While this Industry Notice is intended to provide clear guidance as to Nevada law, Nevada licensees wishing to conduct business with DFS companies should also conduct thorough and objective reviews of DFS activities under the laws of other states and any applicable federal laws.” Agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation have made inquiries into the practices of daily fantasy sports websites after players of the games and lawmakers made allegations of predatory tactics and questioned the use of insider information, according to fantasy players who said they had been contacted by investigators. The F.B.I. began contacting several prominent competitors in the contests, the players said, shortly after an employee of DraftKings, one of the two most prominent daily fantasy companies, admitted to inadvertently releasing data before lineups for the start of the third week of N.F.L. games were locked in. The employee, a midlevel content manager, then won $350,000 at a rival site, although DraftKings said he did not have an advantage. The players said that they were interviewed by agents from the bureau’s Boston office, who seemed to focus primarily on DraftKings, a Boston-based company. They also said that agents were examining whether the site encouraged and accepted deposits and bets from states where the contests were prohibited. It was unclear how far the investigation had proceeded. The F.B.I. declined to comment.
