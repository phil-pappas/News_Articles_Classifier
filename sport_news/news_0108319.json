Clearly this was very damaging for us,\" Cookson said.\n\"We're moving forward very strongly now. We've seen a restoration of the reputation of cycling. We have made huge progress with that. I'm confident we can go forward even more strongly.\"\nCookson also said the anti-doping measures undertaken by the UCI have brought \"the best credibility\" with the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nCookson has been tasked with restructuring the sport to the needs of athletes, teams, race organizers and sponsors after the scandal.\n\"The economics are challenging. There's no question about that,\" Cookson said.\n\"We've reached a balanced situation that recognizes the history and traditions of our sport while at the same time recognizes the need for evolution. We want to preserve what's beautiful about our sport around the world.\"\nCookson said the biggest changes the UCI management committee took at Richmond were to sort out the men's schedule and to start the Women's Tour as a revamp of the past World Cup series.\n\"What we're seeing is an evolution not a revolution,\" Cookson said. \"It's not a big bang solution, but it's one that will allow sustainable development. It's less risky.\"\nAsked about eventual parity between men's and women's offerings, a potential Women's Tour de France, Cookson warned progress would come in measured steps as the market dictates.\n\"We can't flick a switch and change the world overnight,\" he said. \"We've got to let the women's calendar evolve. The women's racing doesn't have to always be a match for men's racing. If we limit it to being a shadow, a copy, of men's pro cycling, we'll limit the evolution of it.\n\"I think it can stand on its own two feet.\"\nCookson said the World Cup leaders jersey used for women but not men is being considered for the men, but there are already plenty of special men's jerseys.\n\"It's something we're looking at,\" he said. \"We have to be a little bit careful how that evolves.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-26T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:28:17.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
