Sarkisian was absent from the team’s scheduled practice Sunday and was asked to take an indefinite leave after Haden determined he was “not healthy.”\nBefore the season started, Sarkisian was forced to issue a public apology for inappropriate behavior at a booster function, adding that a mixture of medication and alcohol had caused him to slur his words and use profanity when addressing the crowd at the school’s “Salute to Troy” event.\nSarkisian said he would seek treatment to deal with the problem and issued a ban on alcohol in the coaches’ locker room after games.\n“Through all of this we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well-being,” Haden said.\nSarkisian’s ouster follows an ugly first half of the season for USC. Picked to win the Pac-12 in the preseason, the Trojans are just 3-2 after a pair of disappointing home losses to Stanford and Washington.\nA former assistant at USC under Pete Carroll, Sarkisian returned as coach of the team after the 2013 season following a four-year spell at Washington. He was 12-6 as coach of the Trojans and has a 46-35 overall record as a head coach.\nWrite to Jonathan Clegg at jonathan.clegg@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:19:57.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
