I was at no stage requested by the FA to make a statement.\nInvestigation \n“I wonder whether this might be the only formal investigation in this country where the evidence of the individuals involved in the incident was not considered relevant. Choosing to ignore some of the evidence will surely influence the outcome of the findings.”\nCarneiro was dropped from first-team duties after Chelsea manager Mourinho criticised her for going onto the pitch to treat Eden Hazard during the opening match of the season against Swansea. She has since parted company with the club.\nCarneiro added: “Last season I had a similar experience at a game at West Ham FC, where I was subject to verbal abuse.\nFollowing complaints by the public, the FA produced a communication to the press saying there had been no sexist chanting during this game.\n“At no time was I approached for a statement despite the fact that vile unacceptable, sexually explicit abuse was clearly heard.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:54:12.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
