Newtown routs Bunnell to remain unbeaten at 5-0 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \nNEWTOWN — Unfortunately for Bunnell, the Newtown football team didn’t get off to a slow start, as it did one-and-a-half weeks ago against Bethel. \nSave for one first-quarter interception, the Nighthawks were on fire from the get-go, building a five-touchdown lead by halftime and rolling to a 44-13 win at home against the Bulldogs while improving to 5-0. \nPlaying a rare Monday night football game, the Nighthawks had 28 points before the Bulldogs had a first down and scored touchdowns on their final five possessions of the first half. \n“Our offensive line is playing real well the last couple weeks, and I couldn’t be happier with how we’re moving the ball up and down the field,” Newtown coach Steve George said. “They’re all new guys from last year, and they’re starting to mature right now.” \nWith the game still scoreless and facing a third-and-six at the Bunnell 38, Justin Dunn threw to his left to hit Ben Mason in the flat. \nMason took care of the rest, running with purpose down the left sideline and delivering a stiff arm before going in for the score. \nStarting running back Hunter Cobb suffered an apparent ankle injury on Newtown’s next possession, but Jared Pearson was there to pick up the slack, turning in a monster night. \n“I was really disappointed with Cobb’s injury, but I was excited to get the ball and get my opportunity tonight,” said Pearson, who carried 23 times for 162 yards and a touchdown. “It was a lot of fun.” \nEthan Carpenter ’s four-yard touchdown run made it 14-0, and Pearson took center stage on the Nighthawks’ next drive, carrying the ball on 10 of the 12 plays and wrapping it up with a nine-yard touchdown on a sweep left, patiently following his blocks in the end zone. \n“We have a lot of good running backs, and unfortunately we only use one,” George said. “Even though Hunter went down, we knew Jared would step up.” \nWith 1:31 left in the half, Newtown concluded an eight-play, 66-yard drive when Dunn threw to his left to hit a wide open Carpenter for the score. \nBunnell’s offense moved the chains for the first time on its next possession, but disaster struck when Mason intercepted a pass over the middle and turned in an impressive 74-yard return for his second touchdown of the night. \n“They execute a game plan as good as anyone I’ve seen in a long time,” Bunnell coach Sean Mignone said of Newtown. \nBunnell’s (2-3) David Vereen killed Newtown’s first possession of the night by stepping in front of a screen pass for the pick and returning it 16 yards to the Nighthawks’ 19. \nFour plays later, however, Newtown’s (5-0) defense forced an incomplete pass for the turnover on downs. \n“David Vereen was in the right spot at the right time and made a big pick,” Mignone said. “We’re down inside the 20, we stalled a little bit and we didn’t score. They had a long drive and scored and the momentum shifted and we never recovered.” \n“It was pretty cool (playing on a Monday),” Pearson said. “We put it in our heads that maybe it was a little Monday Night NFL football game, and that pumped us up. I think it was a unique night.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:17:58.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
