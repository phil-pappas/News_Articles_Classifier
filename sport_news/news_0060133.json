The Gales moved from No. 10 to No. 5 in the Division I state Associated Press poll, and stayed at No. 1 in computer poll. The Cruisers will be another tough road test. \nCircleville (4-1) at Bloom-Carroll (3-2) \n• In 2014: The Bulldogs were 4-6; the Tigers were 6-4. \n• Last meeting: Circleville won 36-39 in 2014. \n• Of note: This will be a tough task for the Bulldogs, who need a win to stay in the Mid-State League-Buckeye Division race, as well as the playoff chase. Playing at home on Thursday night should give the Bulldogs a boost. \nAmanda-Clearcreek (1-4) at Fairfield Union (2-3) \n• In 2014: The Aces were 6-5; the Falcons were 2-8. \n• Last meeting: Amanda-Clearcreek won 29-8 in 2014. \n• Radio: WFCO 90.9-FM, digital delay. \n• Of note: Both of these teams have struggled, so something has to give in this game. \nBerne Union (2-3) at Fairfield Christian (1-4) \n• In 2014: The Rockets were 1-9; the Knights were 1-9. \n• Last meeting: Berne Union won 41-19 in 2014. \n• Of note: The Rockets have shown the ability to score a lot of points, and proved last week they could play defense. This could be a high-scoring affair. \nLiberty Union (1-4) at Logan Elm (4-1) \n• In 2014: The Lions were 7-4; the Braves were 7-4. \n• Last meeting: Liberty Union won 22-0 in 2014. \n• Of note: This is a Mid-State League matchup of two teams going in opposite directions. \nFisher Catholic (3-2) at Grove City Christian (0-5) \n• In 2014: The Irish were 3-7; the Eagles were 6-4. \n• Last meeting: Grove City Christian won 41-37 in 2014. \n• Radio: WLOH (104.5-FM), delayed game. \n• Of note: After losing their first two games, the Irish have won three straight and have put themselves at the top of the Mid-State League-Cardinal Division race, as well as playoff contention. \nHarvest Prep (2-3) at Millersport (2-3) \n• In 2014: The Lakers were 7-3; the Warriors were 8-3. \n• Last meeting: Harvest Prep won 39-0 in 2014. \n• Of note: The injury bug has hit the Lakers, and after a rough start, Harvest Prep seems to be finding its groove. \nHilliard Bradley (5-0) at Canal Winchester (0-5) \n• In 2014: The Indians were 1-9; the Panthers were 9-2. \n• Last meeting: Hilliard Bradley won 42-7 in 2014. \n• Of note: The Indians continue to show some spark on offense, especially in the second half of games. They will need to get off to a good start against a very good Bradley team.
