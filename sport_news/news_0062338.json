Brown's \"dance.\" BOTH seemed choreographed...BUT ONLY one got the 15-yd. excessice celebration penalty. Care to guess which one? Maybe ONLY players on the \"sexy\" NFL teams (ie; Giants, Cowboys, Steelers) are allowed to do it. Am I being too picky? Perhaps. It didn't cost us this time...Another game it might.

NFL should make all play reviewable to make it fair for all teams. Of course that would make the games too long. Still they can make it a point to the refs to even it out. It's actually good for the NFL when underdog teams win, it keeps it more interesting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:53:26.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
