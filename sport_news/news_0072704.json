After going 4-for-4 against the Cubs in the NLCS, the Mets will have five days off before facing the Royals or Blue Jays, beginning Tuesday in Game 1 of the World Series.\n“The pros are you can sit back and dig yourself for a couple of days and that is always fun to know, right?’’ the Royals manager said Thursday at Kauffman Stadium, where some of his players participated in an optional workout. “And the cons are you just get anxious to go. You’ve got to throw maybe some simulated games in batting practice to keep guys sharp.’’\nHowever, what the Mets are waiting for is worth it.\n“I don’t see where there’s too many cons. They are going to the World Series, they are excited,’’ Yost said. “Their workouts are going to be fun and spirited. But once the games start again, the postseason is so much different than the regular season. They will be ready to go.’’\nDavid Price sent out a tweet Thursday accusing the media of twisting his words when it came to being used in relief in the ALCS, throwing in the bullpen during Game 5 and getting ready to come into the game if needed.\n“Haha media is funny..never said I was mad or upset about anything that’s gone on in the playoffs!! And stop twisting my words around..cheers,’’ Price tweeted.\n“I am not upset how things have transpired in the playoffs. The situation we have been in, we are a man down, especially with [Brett] Cecil down and [Aaron] Loup down,’’ Price said of the lefty relievers.\nCecil (calf) is not on the roster. Loup wasn’t with the Blue Jays for Game 5 in order to be with his wife, who gave birth at 27 weeks. That left the Blue Jays with 24 players and no lefty in the pen.\n“We don’t have a lefty in the pen. I understand it and I get it,” Price said. “At this point in the season you have to be ready for whatever. If I had gotten in that game [Wednesday], I am sure [Marcus] Stroman might have pitched Game 6 and I would have been ready for Game 7.“I didn’t see it to be a big deal. The text might have been a little bit weird. There has been good communication and they have definitely kept me in the loop.’’\nAs for Loup, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons didn’t see him Thursday at Kauffman Stadium but said he expects him back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:02:38.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
