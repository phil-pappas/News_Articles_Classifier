I don't see it as being a quick remedy to the situation.\"\nIndustry representatives said they were also \"cautiously optimistic.\"\n\"We don't know if the 24(c) process will solve this problem. Until there is action at the federal level, the 24(c) process appears to be the only avenue available to us,\" said Michael Elliott, executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group. \"So we're cautiously optimistic that manufacturers will want to work through the process and that growers will eventually have additional tools that help them provide a safe, high-quality product to their customers.\"\nCDA officials tried unsuccessfully to get any guidance from EPA on how to handle the issue of pesticides on marijuana when legal recreational sales began in January 2014.\nThe back-and-forth between CDA and EPA over the past three years resulted in a mixed bag of proposed regulations for which pesticides could be allowed to grow cannabis.\nCDA initially hoped to limit permissible pesticides to the most nontoxic, those that don't even require federal registration. But industry pressure to use more effective pesticides pushed that back and the state eventually allowed an array of chemicals whose warning labels were so broadly worded that using them on marijuana would not be a violation.\nIn May — months after Denver health officials quarantined more than 100,000 marijuana plants treated with pesticides not approved by the CDA — the EPA offered a letter outlining the possibility that the exemption program might actually work, but did not guarantee its success.\nAny company wanting an exemption would have to prove the product's safety on marijuana.\nIn late September, CDA devised a new approach , one that, as before, would limit the allowable pesticides for marijuana to the least toxic and those permitted for use on tobacco, but also gave the industry an opening through the 24(c) exemption by allowing it to prove other chemicals are safe to use.\nThe rule-making process is expected to last through January, CDA officials estimate.\nA passive process\nCurrently the state allows more than 200 pesticides on marijuana, but the new rules, if approved, would pare it to about 75 before any exemptions are added.\nEPA approval of a 24(c) application is a passive process. CDA would make the initial approval, then pass the application on to the EPA, which would either deny it or do nothing.\nThe 24(c) exemption was designed for situations of \"an existing or imminent pest problem\" where a pesticide registered with the EPA is not sufficiently available where the problem arises, according to the agency.\nFor example, a special local need registration might allow for a pesticide to be used on soy beans when it is only registered for use on corn, or to be used in an outbreak of a pest unique to a local crop and for which nothing else is available to combat the problem.\nBy showing that a pest cannot be adequately controlled and that unacceptable levels of damage would result without approval, the number of chemicals available to the marijuana industry could increase significantly.\nAny application, however, must also show a pesticide is already allowed on food products and tobacco, and allowed on crops with similar characteristics as cannabis.\nPersuading the pesticide industry to participate might be a hard sell.\n\"The cannabis market is a difficult market to enter because there are so many regulators and people who are afraid of that process — or being discovered in that process,\" said Mike Hughes of Pure Ag, a small agriculture company whose product was recently approved for use on marijuana in Colorado.\n\"I hate to tell you, but you guys are a minor market,\" Sandra McDonald of Mountain West Pest told industry stakeholders at a meeting in late 2014. \"You're not soy, cotton, soybeans, tobacco, rice or corn — the major six.\"\nNo company has yet changed a label to bar a pesticide's use on marijuana, CDA officials confirmed for The Post.\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@denverpost.com or @davidmigoya\nRicardo Baca: 303-954-1394, rbaca@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bruvs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:05:09.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
