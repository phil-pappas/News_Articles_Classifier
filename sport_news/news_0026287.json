Cori Lenzinger added a goal and an assist and Isabelle Houser contributed two assists. \nRELATED : Rapid recap: Voorhees field hockey team downs Belvidere \n“I kept saying ‘we don’t have anything to lose,’” Belvidere coach Beth Franceschino said after her team fell to 6-3-1. “Playing better teams only makes you a better team. A lot of teams look at it as a challenge, but it makes you play harder when you play teams like that.” \nBeaumont finished with 18 saves overall. She made 11 saves in the first half and held Voorhees to one goal despite facing constant pressure. Voorhees outshot Belvidere 22-0 and held a 22-1 advantage in corners. \n“Their goalkeeper (Beaumont) is great, and they packed it in in the circle,” Voorhees coach Taylor Vidak said. “It wasn’t an easy feat to score four goals against that team.” \nBeaumont feels team camaraderie plays a big part in the County Seaters’ success. \n“All the girls love each other, we really do,” Beaumont said. “This is the most loving team I’ve ever been a part of.” \nOther than a few miscues, Franceschino felt her team put forth a solid effort. \n“We made a few mistakes in different spots, but overall I don’t think we let down at all,” she said. “We kept fighting until the last whistle. I can’t ask for any more from my team.” \nBelvidere midfielder Paige White was injured with 9:37 remaining when she took a direct shot off her kneecap, but Franceschino indicated it was nothing serious. \nBeaumont is excited to play out the rest of the season. \n“Everyone wants everyone else to succeed,” she said. “I couldn’t ask for more from my senior year.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
