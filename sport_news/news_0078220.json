My husband and I stopped by for a recent lunch.\nOpened in May, the clean, cozy cafe seats about 30 at a smattering of two and four-person tables. We were greeted by a friendly cashier as we ordered at the counter and she later brought us our food after we chose a table.\nEven though the spot’s specialty is seafood, there are also chicken and tofu options on the modest menu, and there’s always a chalkboard special as well. On the day of our visit it was a garlic shrimp and noodle dish.\nSince it wasn’t unbearably hot during our visit, I wanted to try one of the restaurant’s two soups: New England clam chowder and minestrone ($3.25 for a cup and $4.50 for a large). I opted for the smaller size of the chowder, which was served piping hot. It had the right balance of the brine from the clams with the creaminess of the base without being too thick.\nOther starters on the menu included coconut shrimp ($3.99) served with a piña colada aioli, fried zucchini ($2.49) and fried calamari ($4.99), the latter served with housemade sesame barbecue sauce.\nFor lunch my husband selected battered fish and chips ($8.95) came with three large pieces of deep-fried swai, a mound of fries and fresh coleslaw. The fish was very good, crisp on the outside but flaky on the inside. The thin fries were slightly oversalted, though.\nOther fried selections include a calamari plate, a tempura style shrimp plate (both $8.95) and a panko-crusted chicken plate ($7.95).\nSince I had the chowder, I opted for an a la carte battered fish taco ($2.50) and a grilled shrimp taco ($2.95) over one of the larger plates. There were three large, plump shrimp in the soft tortilla. I had to take a couple of bites with a fork on both tacos so they wouldn’t overflow onto my lap. Both were topped with cabbage, aioli and a housemade pico de gallo.\nThere are also two-taco combinations for $5.95 (tofu, chicken or battered fish) or $6.95 (grilled or battered shrimp). All come with beans and rice.\nDeep Sea Fish Grill also has a number of charbroiled items, all topped with a choice of garlic butter or Cajun-style sauce and served with rice, coleslaw and bread.\nThe entrees start at $7.95 for swai and sole and go up to $11.95 for ahi tuna. The other fish options include tilapia ($8.95), mahi-mahi ($9.95), salmon ($10.95) and skewered shrimp with chili lime ($10.95).\nIf you’re looking for more vegetables, there is a selection of salads that includes tofu, shrimp, chicken or salmon ($6.95-$8.95). Fans on social media rave about the side order of grilled veggies ($2.50).\nWe were far too full for dessert (options include ice cream, brownie a la mode and cheesecake), but I did leave with one regret: not trying the fresh strawberry basil drink. Deep Sea Fish Grill has a rotating selection of juices that look as colorful as they do refreshing.\nAll meals for dining profiles are paid for by The Press-Enterprise.\nContact the writer: vfranko@pe.com or @vanessafranko on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw6cqe-b88538500z.120151013125437000gtaci83t.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw6cqe-b88538500z.120151013125437000g5pci8ke.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw6cqe-b88538500z.120151013125437000g5pci8ke.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw6cqe-b88538500z.120151013125437000gtaci83t.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:39:56.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
