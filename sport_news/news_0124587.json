An isolated sprinkle is still possible, but that's it today. By Saturday, we could see a 20% chance for a few more showers. This low will send a surge of Gulf and Pacific moisture from Hurricane Patricia toward SE LA. This will lead to much needed rainfall!\nA significant cold front looks to push through by Thursday of next week.\nFollow me on Twitter: @Bruce KatzFOX8\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
