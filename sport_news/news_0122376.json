I've been around this program since I was in high school. I'm thinking, 'We're Washington Township. We can beat anybody.' \"\nWashington Township (2-2), which debuts in The Inquirer Top 25 this week at No. 15, defense in difficult conditions as Nick Evangelista recovered a fumble for a touchdown, Murgia scored another, and the Minutemen also registered a safety.\nKicker Cooper Bentz also was instrumental in the victory with a 27-yard field goal as well as a pressure-packed 47-yarder that forced the third overtime.\n\"I told these kids, 'You can win this game,' Wechter said. \"They believed it. They never wavered.\"\nEmotional win. Triton coach Dom Tomeo will never forget the first victory of his career as the Mustangs beat school-district rival Highland, 2-0, on the night when the two programs honored former Triton star Brian Keller.\n\"It was everything,\" Tomeo said of the significance of the Friday night victory.\nKeller was a star quarterback and defensive end who led Triton to an 8-3 record in 2011. He was preparing for his senior season as a tight end at Lafayette College when he died from injuries suffered in an automobile accident in late June.\nKeller's parents, Sue and Mark, as well as his sister Emily were honorary captains. They were presented with a framed No. 15 jersey.\nTomeo said under school district rules, Triton can't officially retire Keller's number. \"But we're just not going to order No. 15 when we order new uniforms,\" Tomeo said. \"Nobody will wear that number.\"\nTriton was 0-3 entering the game but played sturdy defense in difficult field conditions and scored the only points when defensive tackle Dan Hurff recorded a safety in the second quarter.\n\"I'm so happy for our kids,\" Tomeo said. \"When you're 3-0, it's easy to clap and high-five and be the first in line.\n\"But this showed their character. They kept believing.\"\nTomeo said the weather was ideal considering the circumstances.\n\"Mr. Keller said Brian loved playing in bad weather, he called himself a mudder,\" Tomeo said. \"He said Brian probably called for the hurricane.\"\nWalter to William and Mary. Haddonfield two-way end Jake Walter committed to attend William and Mary on a football scholarship on Friday.\nWalter also had offers from Temple, Villanova, Bucknell, Lafayette, Lehigh, Maine, and Rhode Island.\n\"When I visited there, I knew it was everything I was looking for,\" said Walter, who visited the school in Williamsburg, Va., in the summer. \"It was right up my alley.\"\nThe 6-foot-3, 240-pound Walter was recruited as a defensive end. He said he also seriously considered Temple and Villanova.\n\"I felt like the best thing for me was to go away from home,\" Walter said.\nWalter will be the second Haddonfield two-way end to sign with William and Mary in the last two years, following 2015 graduate Ty Klaus.\n\"Ty is a great friend,\" Walter said. \"We text all the time. He wasn't pressuring me, but he was very supportive.\"\nHot quarterback. Senior Jose Tabora has thrown 11 touchdown passes as St. Augustine has bolted to a 4-0 record.\nTabora threw five touchdown passes in a 59-6 victory over Ocean City on Thursday night.\n\"He's making great decisions,\" St. Augustine coach Mark Reardon said. \"He knows he's surrounded by players who can make plays for him. He's not forcing anything. He's playing smart football.\"\nphilly.com/jerseysidesports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T03:35:15.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
