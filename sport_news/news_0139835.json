The Scot grimaced at his early efforts while Van Gerwen looked like he hadn't had a break after racing through his semi-final 24 hours earlier. \nThornton didn't even get a shot at a finishing double as the first set flashed past in a blaze of lime green. \nAs the maximums flowed for Van Gerwen, Thornton gritted his teeth and took a thrilling second set - edging two legs ahead, withstanding a fightback, and defeating his own nerves for the crucial checkout. \nFinally feeling a sense of belonging alongside the world No 1, Thornton took the third set as well after throwing the better arrows and matching everything Van Gerwen could muster. \nThe Dutchman, wholly unimpressed, raced through the next set in double-quick time with a 110 checkout for good measure. \nBut his composure deserted him at 2-2 in the fifth set with the odds stacked in his favour. Van Gerwen missed double 16, then six darts to take out just eight. Thornton sneaked the set from his opponent's clutches, only for Van Gerwen to rapidly reel off the next three legs. \nApproaching the business end of the final, the seventh set was a rollercoaster of the crowd's emotions as Van Gerwen wasted an early break of throw. Thornton caught him cold when the Dutchman screwed up a checkout from eight, then took the crucial leg with a 74 checkout moments after the world No 1 missed with 80 left. \nVan Gerwen forced a decider but the brilliant Dutchman, by this stage, appeared to be chasing the contest with the Irish crowd now vociferously backing the underdog. \nIn the final two legs of the decider, Van Gerwen faltered with his doubles and Thornton's biggest moment at the oche was realised. \nThe world No 7 from Scotland had lost his previous seven encounters with Van Gerwen but finally arrested that slide in advance of the Grand Slam of Darts.
