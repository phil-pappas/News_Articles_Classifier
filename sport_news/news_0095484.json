We lived in public housing,” Pierre recalled. \nPierre’s parents continued to support him as he grew into a star athlete. When Pierre was just 15 years old, his family’s support became even more crucial as Pierre embarked on fatherhood. \n“At the time it was very scary, being 15, not really knowing what to do,” Pierre explained. \nPierre’s wife and high school sweetheart Morgan Desir added, “Even just being a young dad, when he was 16 and his daughter was born, he was instantly amazing. I could just tell right then he was going to be great.” \nHe continued to pursue football and college with the help of his parents. Division one schools showed interest but Pierre could not get his ACT scores high enough, so he settled on a division two school, Washburn University. \nAfter his second daughter was born, he requested a transfer so he could be closer to home. His coached denied his request. As a result he could not receive a scholarship or play football for a year. At the time he worked odd and unpleasant jobs to make ends meet. \n“It was an apartment complex during flood season. This basement was completely torn apart with human waste trash, water everywhere, mud and we had to clean it,” Pierre recollected one his temp jobs. “I had to do it. I needed to make sure I got the eight hours because I needed the money that day.” \nHe returned to football at division two Lindenwood University where he made history, becoming the first player from Lindenwood to be drafted into the NFL when the Browns chose him in the fourth round of the 2014 Draft. One year later, he is a starter in the NFL. \n“I think everything that I went through has prepared me for whatever the NFL can throw at me,” Pierre said. \nAs he looks back on his journey, the father of three hopes one day his children can learn from his experiences. \nPierre said, “I just hope they learn that hard work pays off and if you have a dream just continue to go after that dream (and) to surround yourself with your family because when you don't have anything they are the ones that are going to support you through it all.” \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:12:45.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
