(Getty Images) \nAlabama has not made things easy on itself, but it kept its College Football Playoff hopes alive with a 19-14 win over Tennessee on Saturday in Tuscaloosa. \nAgain, the Crimson Tide got off to a slow start, managing only seven points in the first half, but they came up with a big-time drive to take the lead late in the fourth quarter, then clinched the game with a forced fumble. The Tide move to 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the SEC, while the Volunteers fall to 3-4 (1-3 in the SEC), with all four of their losses by a touchdown or less. Three Takeaways \n1. Run the ball, Lane? \nAlabama is not going to give the ball to Derrick Henry 40 times every game, and it shouldn't. The balance on Saturday was a bit strange, though: Henry touched the ball only nine times in the first half, and the teams went into halftime tied at seven. Nick Saban probably had a conversation with his offensive coordinator, Lane Kiffin, at halftime â€¦ and the Crimson Tide opened the second half with four straight Henry runs, before becoming pass-heavy again for a bit. That drive resulted in a field goal, and Alabama continued to lean heavily on Henry, who ended up running 28 times for 143 yards and two touchdowns -- including the game-winner with 2:43 left. 4th quarter craziness.&#10;&#10;Alabama responded to Tennessee&#39;s TD with another TD in this @BestBuy highlight. https://t.co/iztSCr5rc7 &mdash; CBS Sports (@CBSSports) October 24, 2015 \nFor all the complaining, though, Jake Coker completed 21 of 27 passes for 247 yards and an interception, with freshman wide receiver Calvin Ridley impressing again. Ridley caught seven passes for 88 yards and made some plays against acclaimed Tennessee cornerback Cameron Sutton. \n2. Tennessee still can't beat Nick Saban \nThe Vols have defeated Saban once: Sept. 29, 2001, when Saban was coaching LSU and the No. 7 Volunteers beat the No. 14 Tigers 26-18 . Since arriving at Alabama, Saban has made life miserable for the Vols, winning all nine meetings of the two cross-division rivals. The positive for Tennessee is that at least this one was close: It was the first time the Vols stayed within single digits since 2009. This is Tennessee&#39;s first lead over Alabama since 2011. &mdash; Josh Ward (@Josh_Ward) October 24, 2015 \nThe Vols put up an admirable fight and had a chance to win in the fourth quarter. After Adam Griffith kicked his second field goal of the second half to put Alabama up 13-7 with 7:08 left, Joshua Dobbs quickly led Tennessee on a four-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in 1:19, capped by a 12-yard touchdown run by Jalen Hurd. Tennessee powered through and took the lead over Alabama in this @BestBuy highlight. https://t.co/nY6b1OM6nF &mdash; CBS Sports (@CBSSports) October 24, 2015 \nBut Alabama responded with an impressive drive of its own, going 71 yards in eight plays, capped by Henry's touchdown with 2:24 left. Tennessee got the ball back, but Dobbs lost a fumble on a hit by Alabama's Ryan Anderson, which clinched the game for the Crimson Tide. \nYour thoughts, Peyton? &mdash; SEConCBS (@SEConCBS) October 24, 2015 \n3. Don't blame the kicker \nTennessee lost by five, and thus it would be easy to blame the kicker, because Aaron Medley missed all three of his field-goal attempts. It would be reasonable to ask for at least one make, but Tennessee didn't put him in great position: His misses came from 43, 51 and 51 yards -- one of which was at the end of the first half. \nThe Vols ran into expected problems because, with injuries, they started two freshmen on the offensive line against the nation's best defensive front. Hurd ended up running 18 times for 92 yards and a touchdown, while Dobbs completed 13 of 22 passes for 171 yards and a touchdown and was held to 19 rushing yards on 16 attempts (including sacks). Tennessee just couldn't quite sustain drives long enough, which is a typical occurrence against this loaded Alabama defense. \nIt's yet another frustrating defeat for the Vols, but they put up an impressive fight. At some point, the close losses are going to start turning into some close wins. Stat of the Game Derrick Henry now has a rushing TD in 13 straight games, the longest streak in Alabama history pic.twitter.com/Ai4YzPuSZF &mdash; ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 24, 2015 \nThe Alabama has occasionally struggled to get into a rhythm on offense, but it's obvious who the foundation of the attack should be. Henry scored both of the Tide's touchdowns to beat the Vols. \n* * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:33:48.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
