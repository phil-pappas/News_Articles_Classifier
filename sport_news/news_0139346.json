But at Wayne Hills, a 23-20 setback to Pascack Valley last Friday night in Hillsdale was met by some pretty direct statements from head coach Wayne Demikoff. \n\"We don't have moral victories at Wayne Hills,\" said a water-logged Demikoff. \"We're here to win (state) championships. We don't lose by three points and say 'we gave it a good effort'. We lost. End of statement.\" \nWayne Hills returns to action tonight when its biggest rival, Ramapo, comes to town for a 7 p.m. kickoff. While it's still early October, this is the Patriots' last home game of the regular season. And if the team doesn't win here, chances are any playoff games this season will also be played on the road. \nLast Friday's game marked the fifth-straight loss by Wayne Hills to Pascack Valley, dating back to 2012. Pascack Valley has put together a marvelous tradition, including two-straight NJSIAA sectional championships in 2013 and 2014, as well as an appearance in the 2012 final. The past two seasons, the Patriots and Indians have gone down to the wire, with Pascack winning a thriller, 21-19 last year and then holding off a late Wayne Hills rally this year to prevail by a field goal. \n\"Pascack Valley has a tremendous team,\" said Demikoff. \"And the reason why they're winning close games, like the games we had with them the last two times, is they find a way to win in the trenches. We fell behind early (last Friday night), and I liked the way our kids came back in the second half. We had chances to win. Yes, we were without a key man in our offense (Luca Grave), but injuries are a part of the game.\" \nGrave, a junior tailback and the team's most explosive offensive threat, was sidelined with a knee injury, which was incurred in the second half of a win at Northern Highlands on Sept. 26. Grave appears to be recovering, but a very wet field last Friday night wasn't the most conducive surface for him to test the leg. He's hopeful of playing this Friday night. \nDemikoff had reminded his team prior to last Friday's game that the aura of winning titles at Wayne Hills had ended at Pascack Valley the last time the teams played there in the 2012 playoffs. That was also Chris Olsen's last game as head coach and the Patriots lost a 20-11 contest. \nThe past two seasons, the teams had played in Wayne. This time, the Patriots (4-1) were hampered by some miscommunication in the defensive secondary, which led to two first-half touchdowns by Pascack Valley, the second coming on the final play of the half on a 67-yard score that made it 20-7 at halftime. \nWayne Hills' lone tally in the first half was on a 23-yard scoring pass from quarterback Brendan DeVera to Joe Kenny late in the second quarter, which was followed by a Dario Simi kick that made it 14-7. At the time, it appeared the Patriots had momentum, but the Indians' score at the end of the half turned that around. \nNevertheless, Wayne Hills was dominant in the second half. It cut the Indians lead to 20-14 in the third on a two-yard run by DeVera and Simi's kick. But what may have been the key to the game occurred late in the third quarter. Pascack Valley (4-0) had driven deep into Wayne Hills territory, but the defense stiffened and on fourth down it appeared Pascack Valley had fumbled the snap which would have given Wayne Hills the ball back on downs. Instead, the official ruled a penalty on the snap, pushing PV back five yards, but keeping the ball in their possession. On the next play, early in the fourth, Pascack Valley's Matt Urrea booted a key 27-yard field goal that extended the lead to 23-14. \nDemikoff was noticeably disappointed with the official's call, knowing that his team would have gained possession down by just six points, but didn't want to discuss the call afterward. Wayne Hills rallied back in the fourth, cutting the lead to 23-20 on a one-yard run by DeVera. \nLater in the fourth, Wayne Hills put itself in position to tie, or win, by driving 70 yards deep into PV territory, but the Indians' defense held on to win. Senior wide receiver Vincent LoVerde played a marvelous game on offense for Wayne Hills, catching five passes for 113 yards. Kenny had another stellar game on defense with 13 tackles while DeVera was 6-for-13 for 135 yards and a touchdown pass. DeVera also rushed for 104 yards on 17 carries and Jacob Casale played well, running for 75 yards on 10 carries. \nNOTES: The Patriots should have little problem getting fired up for Friday night's game. Ramapo and Wayne Hills have enjoyed a storied rivalry, which was interrupted by scheduling changes in the Big North Conference in 2012 and 2013. The teams renewed the rivalry last year, with Wayne Hills winning a thriller, 22-21, in Franklin Lakes. Ramapo last defeated the Patriots in the 2009 sectional championship game at the old Giants Stadium, 16-8. The last time Ramapo won at Wayne Hills was on Oct. 29, 2004, 24-20. Ironically, Wayne Hills began its legendary 55-game winning streak the following week and eventually would avenge the loss to Ramapo in the playoffs that year, winning 38-28, en route to the school's second state championship.
