Rousey fought Bethe Correia a month after the program went into effect, which is likely why she was tested to much. Correia was tested four times. \nRousey, the UFC women’s bantamweight champion, is scheduled to fight Holly Holm on Nov. 14. She will likely be tested at least one more time before that bout. \nCris Cyborg Justino, who was popped for using steroids after a Strikeforce title defense in 2011, has been tested twice under the USADA program. She shared a photo on Twitter. Tonight commission came to watch my dance class! pic.twitter.com/rW2KCbzPER \nRousey has blasted Cyborg over her steroid use in the past, though Dana White clearly wants the two fighters to meet if Cyborg can drop some weight. \nOn the men’s side, featherweights Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor have been tested twice. Thiago Alves and Antonio Silva took four tests, but no male fighter was tested five times like Rousey. \nRandom?
