It’s been roughly the same time since the Virat Kohli-Ravi Shastri combine took firm control of things in the longer format. And in this brief period, MS Dhoni’s famous ‘cool’ seems to be on the way out, and Kohli’s infamous aggression is on the way to becoming the defining trait of the Indian team. So it wasn’t surprising at all that the first thing Dhoni was asked to comment on today was the team’s changing attitude and approach. And instead of speaking for long without actually saying anything, the habit that he had acquired over the last few years, the T20I and ODI skipper came up with a succinct answer. “Being aggressive doesn’t mean exchanging heated words or having a physical confrontation. You could be aggressive in your own way. Rahul Dravid, for instance, believed that a good forward defence to a fast bowler could be the best form of aggression. So it’s nice to be aggressive, but you’ve got to respect the guidelines,” said Dhoni, who is returning to the thick of action after three months, perhaps the longest break he has had in his decade-long international career. The next question — about the team’s and his own batting order — too was a tricky one. Remember, he promoted himself to No. 4 in the ODI series against Bangladesh, pushing Rahane out of the squad. Although he did well at No. 4, many felt the move was unwarranted as the team needs him more at No. 6 than at No. 4. Instead of giving some vague answer, he admitted there was a bit of confusion in this regard as most of the batsmen in the side are top-order players. “If you see, most of our batsmen either open or come one down in the IPL for their teams. Dhawan, Rahane, Raina, Virat, Rohit… All these are top-order players. But someone has to play in the middle and lower middle order, so we will see what combinations suit us the best,” he said. With much of the staleness gone from his answers and his body not under as much stress after giving up Test cricket, Dhoni looks primed for what is a very crucial series for him. Already, there are whispers about the need to give the captaincy in all formats to Kohli. It will happen at some point in the future, of course, but Dhoni would want it to happen on his own terms. In that backdrop, this series becomes crucial for him both as a batsman and skipper. Having already lost an ODI series to Bangladesh, he can’t afford to lose another one. If that happens, he could find himself in a very tricky situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:13:43.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
