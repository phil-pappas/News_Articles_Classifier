Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for half of the global poor.\nHe said the prospect of emerging economies losing steam could challenge promises to eradicate extreme poverty.\n“If economic growth of the developing world over the last 15 years was an anomaly, was a blip, then we’re in trouble,” said Laurence Chandy, a fellow at the Brookings Institution whose research focuses on global poverty.\n“If instead it’s a kind new normal then we’ve got a good chance of getting close to this goal,” he said.\nThe World Bank first introduced a global poverty line in 1990, setting it at $1 a day. It was adjusted last in 2008, when the group raised it to $1.25 a day.\nAcross the planet, the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped by more than half since 1990, when 1.9 billion people lived on under $1.25 a day, compared to 836 million in 2015, according to the UN.\nThis follows the adoption in 2000 of the Millennium Development Goals, which included the eradication of extreme poverty.\nReplacing the MDGs are the Sustainable Development Goals, a set of 17 goals to combat poverty, inequality and climate change by 2030 – with ending extreme poverty for all people everywhere, a key target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:10:05.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
