Due to the ongoing police investigation, we are unable to discuss this matter further at this time.\" \nAccording to a statement from the LAPD, a victim reported the rape in October 2014, and she recently identified the 20-year-old football player as a suspect. \nPolice said Searl was booked on three counts of rape, but has since been released on bail. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
