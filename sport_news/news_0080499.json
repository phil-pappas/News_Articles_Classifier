(AP/Andy Kuno) Comments \nThe Seattle Mariners named Los Angeles Angels assistant general manager Scott Servais as their new manager on Friday, according to multiple reports. \nServais, is another former catcher with no previous managerial or coaching experience, who has been tapped for a big league managing position. \nJason Varitek, who's currently serving as a special assistant in Boston, had interviewed for the job, but it was unclear how serious he was about relocating to Seattle. \nVaritek also has no previous managerial or coaching experience since retiring in 2011. \nServais will become the fifth current major league manager (Kevin Cash, Brad Ausmus, A.J. Hinch and Mike Matheny) who caught in the majors and will serve a manager with no experience. \nTim Bogar, who was a coach in Boston from 2009-12, will be Servais' bench coach.
