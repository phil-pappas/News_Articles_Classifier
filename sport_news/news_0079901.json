But a message is sent when a high-profile athlete expected to play a high-profile sport for a high-profile basketball program is not yet ruled eligible in mid-October. The message: The NCAA believes there is reason to check, re-check and triple-check a potential problem. \nThe NCAA has not yet made a ruling on the eligibility of one of Kansas' top freshmen, Cheick Diallo. Media reports have suggested it's all right for Kansas fans to be concerned. \nCalipari all but scoffed at media interest in Labissiere's review. \n\"How did this ... become like a firestorm?\" he said. \nWell, let's see. First, it's UK basketball, which is synonymous with firestorms, real and imagined. As Calipari himself said at the 2011 Madness, \"We do more than move the needle. We are the needle.\" \nThen, there's the widely held view that Labissiere may be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. Calipari has likened him to Karl-Anthony Towns , the UK player who was the first pick in the 2015 draft. Key player on the pre-season No. 1 team equals heightened interest. \nThe what's-the-big-deal question does apply to the idea of someone trying to use a star prospect for financial gain. AAU coach Keith Easterwood helped light this fuse last year by saying Labissiere's guardian asked him how to profit off a player. Easterwood followed up last week by saying that this kind of question is fairly routine in the recruiting world. \n\"Over the years, it's not uncommon (to be asked) 'How do I get a shoe deal?'\" he said Tuesday on Gary Parrish 's Memphis-based radio show. \"I get people who call me because they have a relationship. Because they think they have a good player. People ask, 'How do I get paid for this?' \n\"I've never stepped over the line and tried to pimp a kid. But I get those calls all the time.\" \nParrish, a respected reporter for CBSSports.com, said Labissiere's guardian, Gerald Hamilton , went to great lengths during the recruiting process trying to find out how he could fund his 501 (c)(3) foundation called Reach Your Dream. \n\"It's not terribly unusual for an adult to try to profit in some way off of an elite recruit,\" Parrish said in an email. \"But Gerald mishandled the entire situation from the very beginning, and that's why this has become such a big deal. He talked openly, and constantly, about funding his foundation â€” the implication always being that Skal was his key to doing that.\" \nParrish also questioned Hamilton's judgment with regard to Labissiere playing for more than one high school and AAU program. \n\"He bounced Skal from one summer team to the next, then from one high school to another, all of which is often a red flag in the NCAA's eyes,\" Parrish said in the email. \"So Gerald, and Gerald alone, created this dilemma, and I predicted this years ago. So now Skal is left to see what, if anything, the NCAA can find. And that really is too bad. Because Skal genuinely is a sweetheart of a young man, and he wouldn't be in this position if Gerald would've just played everything straight ... or, at least, less clumsily.\" \nBetter than Simmons? \nOak Hill Academy Coach Steve Smith coached against Skal Labissiere 's team in the Marshall County Hoop Fest last year. He came away impressed. \n\"I thought he was the best player we played against last year,\" Smith said. \nAmong the players Oak Hill Academy faced last season were Harry Giles , the No. 1 rated player in the class of 2016, and LSU freshman Ben Simmons , who some rated the best player in the class of 2015. \n\"I thought he was better than Ben Simmons,\" Smith said. \"And, Ben Simmons, everybody talks about him being LeBron ( James ).\" \nWhy does Smith think Labissiere is better than Simmons? \"His skill level for a player his size was off the charts ... ,\" the Oak Hill coach said. \"He moved athletically like he was about a 6-2 guard, not a 6-11 guy.\" \nSmith is hoping the NCAA makes Labissiere eligible. \n\"Because he is a good player,\" the Oak Hill coach said. \"I'm sure they (the Cats) need him this year desperately. He would be one of their best players, if not their best player, probably.\" \nSkal and Cal \nOne of Skal Labissiere 's high school coaches said the player will have no problem being pushed by John Calipari . \n\"He'll welcome it,\" said Terry Tippett , who coached Labissiere at Evangelical Christian School in Cordova, Tenn. \"He soaks up coaching. He wants to be coached. So I don't think (Calipari) can be too hard on him.\" \nWhen reminded of how Calipari constantly wanted more-more-more from such talented players as Terrence Jones, Julius Randle and Karl-Anthony Towns , Tippett laughed. \n\"He wants to be good,\" he said of Labissiere. \"He wants to be coached. He may not know he's not playing hard, but he isn't intentionally lazy. Cal will bring that out of him.\" \nOf course, not all players welcome a demanding coach. \n\"Some of them resist you,\" Tippett said. \"Some are OK. They can't get enough. They ask questions. They stay later. \n\"We couldn't run Skal out of the gym. He was in the gym all day every day. He asks questions. He's a student of the game. He just works, works, works. That's why I don't think Cal can be too hard on him.\" \nOne man, one vote \nThe Southeastern Conference will announce its pre-season awards this week. Media vote for an all-league team, Player of the Year and predicted order of finish. \nHere's my ballot:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:40:29.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
