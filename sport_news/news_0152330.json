We usually talk football, but we want to make sure that they’re living the right way and doing the right thing.”\nWinthrop High School will not practice this week and will forfeit its game against Gloucester tomorrow after police announced they are investigating a locker-room video being circulated that shows a football player changing.\nSwampscott High School also forfeited games earlier this month after officials said the football team had five teammates perform exercises and athletic drills naked in the center of the school’s football field. Swampscott forfeited a freshman game and a varsity game against Saugus High School.\n“We talk about it all the time. We talk about hazing and bullying and how it’s not acceptable. It’s not part of athletics, and it’s not part of society,” said Duane Sigsbury, head football coach at Billerica High School. “Every time something does happen in the news, we go over it with them. They have to be responsible in the community, the field and the locker rooms.”\nWinthrop police Chief Terence M. Delehanty said police are speaking with at least 10 students and their parents about the video. Though a student said the video was sent through a group text message, Delehanty would not comment on how widely it was distributed.\nDelehanty declined to go into detail about the case and also would not say whether the student who was taped knew the video was being made.\nHazing is considered a crime under Massachusetts law, but it is a difficult problem to put a stop to, according to Dr. Susan Lipkins, a psychologist who has studied the problem. She said hazing is passed down from generation to generation as a type of rite of passage. There is also a “code of silence” that prevents teens from ratting on each other, Lipkins said.\nShe said canceling games is common but it doesn’t solve the underlying problem.\n“I think that it gets everyone in the community aware of what’s going on, and maybe other communities look and think, ‘We don’t want that happening to us,’ ” Lipkins said. “But adolescents believe that they have a special coding. They don’t think it’s going to happen to them — they think it’s going to happen to everyone else.”\nWinthrop Superintendent John J. Macero said the incident was a blow to the school’s reputation.\n“When anything like this happens it gives you a black eye on our programs, and we don’t like that at all because it’s a representation of Winthrop Public Schools,” he said.\nMacero said he believes the video was taken Monday evening in the boys locker room.\nPolice said they are working with the Suffolk District Attorney’s Office to determine if any charges will be filed.\nMacero added students need to set limits on using their smartphones, adding: “Today in the world with phones and social media, they just send things around and they don’t understand — unlike us who didn’t have that social media when we were younger.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:19:11.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
