I have to go to talk to Chubb. That’s impressive.” \nFournette leads the SEC and the nation in rushing with an average of 216.0 yards a game. Chubb is a distant second in the SEC and third nationally at 149.0 yards per game. \n“The last game how many yards did he have?” Mitchell said. “We were playing on Saturday so I can’t keep up with it.” \nFournette rushed for 233 yards against Eastern Michigan Saturday. That followed 244 rushing yards against Syracuse and 228 against Auburn becoming the first player in SEC history to rush for 200 in three straight games. \nChubb continues to be asked about his streak week after week. \n“It would be good to just get over 100 yards just in general because it’s a good game for the offense,” he said Tuesday. \nChubb rushed for 146 yards on 20 carries against Alabama, but was kept in check until he broke off an 83-yard touchdown run near the end of the third quarter. \nI think strategically, we'd have been better off trying to go downhill more,” coach Mark Richt said. “There were things we tried to do outside, and with the wet turf and just some matchups we had out there on the edge, I think our best shot would have been to go downhill against them.\" \n  Go to the previous story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:51:44.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
