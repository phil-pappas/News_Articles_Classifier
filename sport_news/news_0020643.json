He rushed for another 90 yards and two touchdowns on 14 carries. He returned an interception 89 yards for another touchdown. And he make a touchdown-saving tackle, coming from behind to chase down a Wayne Hills running back after a 75-yard run. \nIt was just another game for Woetzel, who also serves as a cornerback on defense. \nThe performance earned Woetzel The Record's Athlete of the Week honor. \nFor the season, Woetzel has six TD passes, 319 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns. \n\"We thought he was capable of this,” Ramapo coach Drew Gibbs said. “I think the one area you get impressed with is his game management and poise at the quarterback spot. Also, for a guy in his first year as a starting quarterback, his leadership, just his demeanor in a big game. \n\"He steps up. He doesn’t crumble under the pressure.” \nWoetzel's commitment was reported by NorthJerseySports.com. \n© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:04.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
