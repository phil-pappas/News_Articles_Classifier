They can still bounce back in a division where the other three teams are each 2-2, but they hardly look like a legitimate playoff contender.\nCritics are hammering Kelly for his risky, headline-grabbing offseason moves, and many are questioning his up-tempo offense that leaves the defense on the field far too long. Kirk Cousins led the Redskins on a 15-play, 90-yard touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter against a defense that look tired after being on the field two-thirds of the game.\nBut Kelly sees a team that's a couple plays from 3-1.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n___\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/jsonline.com/MAI/330775671/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A", "https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:06:47.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
