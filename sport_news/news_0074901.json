We bought no vote.\"\nBeckenbauer has not responded to repeated requests for comment from Reuters. His agent could not be reached on Saturday.\nThe DFB, which is headed by Niersbach, on Friday also vehemently rejected the Spiegel's report, saying its own investigation had found no wrongdoing in the process of being awarded the 2006 World Cup in a FIFA vote.\nHowever, the DFB said it was investigating a payment of 6.7 million euros ($7.6 million) from the 2006 organizing committee to FIFA for a cultural program during the 2006 World Cup and whether it was used as intended.\nDer Spiegel claimed this payment was a return of a loan paid to the bid committee by the late Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus to help it set up the alleged slush fund.\nFIFA was plunged into the biggest crisis of its 111-year history in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted in the United States on bribery, money laundering and wire fraud charges involving more than $150 million in payments.\n(Reporting by Karolos Grohmann ; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:41:19.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
