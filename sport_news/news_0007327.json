It's a short bus trip, and we're just happy to be playing in a playoff game and not just watching.\" \n\"I was hoping it would be Hartland,\" Brighton senior Joey Clifford said. \"Ever since we lost to them, I was hoping to play them again.\" \nHowell coach Aaron Metz's team had thought for a moment it would miss the playoffs after injuries ruined a 5-1 start. \nThe Highlanders were helped by one of the largest fields for 5-4 teams in recent memory. A total of 40 teams with that record got into the playoffs this year; many years it's less than a dozen. \nAll that, however, was ancient history the moment the pairings flashed onto TV screens across the state. \n\"We played Grand Ledge in 2010, so there's a little history,\" Metz said. \"It's good to be playing somewhere different, but most importantly it's an opportunity. We'll take any matchup we can and go for it.\" \nGrand Ledge has the top seed the next two weeks, so it could play host to Hartland in a rematch of last year's playoff game between the teams, which the Comets won 21-0 on a snowy Halloween night. \nGrand Ledge also has played Brighton in the playoffs, the last time in 2000 when the Comets held off a powerful Bulldogs team and went on to win the state championship. \nAt the beginning of the century, coaches got together to watch the show and players watched at their homes. These days, it's a team event. \n\"We watched film from Friday, then the selection show,\" said Savage, who had his team gathered at Hartland High School, as in the past. \"The kids went home, and the coaches are here trying to get stuff done.\" \nHowell also gathered at the high school to watch on a projection TV in the field house. \n\"I like it better than going out to watch the show,\" Metz said. \"It's a good team-building atmosphere, and it was kind of a cool setting, just our players and coaches.\" \nBrighton coach Brian Lemons, in white cap, is surrounded by players while watching Sunday's MHSAA playoff selection show at the Legacy Center.
