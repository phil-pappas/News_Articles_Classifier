A group of ten players were at three-under 69. On a hot and humid day when 30 players broke par, Morocco’s Younes El Hassani and Mustapha El Maouas carded matching three-under 69s for a share of the lead in the MENA division, one shot clear of their compatriots Mohamed Belaroussia and Mehdi Saissi. \nAlso, India’s 15 year old Rayhan Thomas returned a two-under 70, highlighted by an eagle on the 13th, to occupy solo second in the amateur division behind Alexander. \nFor the hosts, Azaan al Rumhy carded a disappointing nine over par for 81 to be placed tenth in the amateur category that comprises 11 players. \nOman's other golfer, Ali Hameed, decided to withdraw at the last-minute. He told Muscat Daily, “I wanted to focus on the forthcoming Nomura Cup in Abu Dhabi, UAE that begins on Thursday.” Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:49:27.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
