I lost control of my car. My teammates, including Marshawn, stopped 2 check on me. They weren't racin me\n— Fred Jackson (@Fred22Jackson) October 21, 2015 Though Jackson escaped injury – and did not crash into any other cars or bicyclists in a heavily-trafficked intersection – this is another headache for a Seahawks team in turmoil.\nFullback Derrick Coleman was arrested last Wednesday and spent two nights in jail on felony charges of vehicular assault and hit-and-run stemming from a crash in nearby Bellevue, Wash. That crash also occurred shortly after Coleman left the practice facility.\nThe team immediately suspended Coleman for the week, but he was reactivated on Tuesday, a day before the team is scheduled to travel to Santa Clara, Calif. for Thursday’s game against the division rival San Francisco 49ers.\n102 CONNECT 102 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LJDu7s", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809719298864282-GTY-490356564-76309692.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1LJDu7s", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/732941ac6f23d2f89acf53321b6ae5208725bc0c/c=0-13-2231-2988&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809719298864282-GTY-490356564-76309692.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bb9c441c9e17037375f63a738cedddac91ee9d40/r=297x400/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809719298864282-GTY-490356564-76309692.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LJDu7s&text=Fred%20Jackson%20crashes%20car%20outside%20Seahawks%20facility&via=enquirer", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LJDu7s&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/Fred22Jackson/status/656655528152567808"], "published": "2015-10-21T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:05:29.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
