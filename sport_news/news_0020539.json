The allegations centred around the notion that then-Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus secretly filled a slush fund with 10.3 million Swiss francs. \nBeckenbauer, head of the organising committee, and Wolfgang Niersbach, current head of the DFB, are said to have been aware of the fund from 2005 at the latest. \nLouis Dreyfus is alleged to have lent the illicit funds to the bidding committee prior to the World Cup vote on July 6, 2000, but it never appeared in their budget and was used to bribe FIFA officials.
