Northgate opened the scoring in the second half with two scores just 12 seconds apart to take a lead for good. \nThe Vikings got help from a defensive effort that forced six Drew turnovers on four fumbles and two interceptions. \nFor Northgate, the second-half wakeup call might have been just what it needed heading into next week’s game against unbeaten Starr’s Mill, with the winner advancing to this year’s Region 4- Championship on Nov. 6. \nThe Vikings headed into the contest with Drew winning by an average of 45 points, and finishing off most their contest with a running clock. \nNorthgate head coach Tommy Walburn expected Friday’s matchup with the Titans to be a tough test, but he challenged his team at the half to play like they had all season. \n“We had just had to go back to basics in the second half,” said Walburn, whose 101th career victory was a bit tougher than No. 100 last week in a 68-0 blowout over Forest Park. “We were able to get Kyle established in the second half and that made a huge difference. \nDrew quarterback Joseph Newman finished with over 200 all-purpose yards, help- ing the Titans move the ball. But the Vikings defense did a better job containing him in the final two quarters, and turnovers played a big role in the victory. \nAfter neither team was able to score on early drive to open the second half, the Vikings put the ball in the end zone twice 12 seconds apart in the third quarter. \nCater’s 1-yard plunge and James Skalski’s extra point put the Vikings ahead 14-13. \nOn the Titans’ next series, Terrence Carter intercepted a Drew pass and returned it 42-yards for the touchdown and a 21-13 lead. \nDrew wasn’t done, however, the Titans answered back on the next series early in the fourth quarter when Newman called his own number and scored on a short run to cut the lead to 21-19. \nThe Vikings stopped the Titans two-point conversion attempt — aided by a holding call — when Cameron Ramsey and William Young broke up a pass attempt from the 15-yard line. \nNorthgate’s defense came up with two more turnovers, including an interception by Skalski and another fumble recovery to stop late series by the Titans. \nCater and Evans put an exclamation point on the victory with the two late touchdowns. \n“I think we really needed a test like this heading into the game with Starr’s Mill,” Cater said. “We have been working hard since summer and it is paying off.” \nDrew added a touchdown as time expired. \nThe Titans took a 13-0 lead in the game scoring on offense and defense. \nNewman connected on a 7-yard pass to Cedric Davenport with 8:26 left in the first quarter and Justin Fantroyal returned Kyle McLaren’s interception 22-yards for a touchdown, but the extra point was blocked. \nOn the next play, Evans put the Vikings back in the game with a 60-yard run. \nVikings 35, Titans 25 \nNorthgate 0 7 14 14 —35 \nDrew 7 6 0 12—25 \n1st Quarter \nD—Joseph Newnan 7 pass to Cedric Daven- port (kick good), 8:26 \n2nd Quarter \nD—Justin Fantroyal 22 interception return (kick blocked), 4:39 \nNorthgate—Ton Evans 62 yard run (James Skalski kick), 4:32 \n3rd Quarter \nN—Kyle Cater 2 run (Skalski kick), 3:01 N—Terrance Carter 42 interception (Skalski kick) 2:49 \n4th Quarter \nD— Joseph Newnan 2 run (two-point failed), 11:10 \nN— Cater 1 run (Skalski kick), 3:15 \nN — Cater 2 run (Skalski kick), 2:20 D-Newman 11 pass to Lloyd Wheeler (no try), 0:00 More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:40:05.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
