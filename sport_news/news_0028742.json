The Carioca Cricket Club is hosting an open event for the national tournament in Rio de Janeiro on the weekend of October 31st and November 1st , photo courtesy of the CCC. \nThe CCC is also excited to welcome back the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) as a co-sponsor of this year’s event. Austrade is the Australian government’s agency dedicated to Australia’s economic prosperity. Their purpose is to help Australian companies connect with offshore markets, while also promoting the country’s educational institutions, tourism operators, governments, and citizens. \nThe CCC put on a brave performance at Brasília on July 4th and 5th. The team played four matches in the first round of the competition for the John Landers Shield, finishing with one win and three losses. While Hanbury acknowledged that the CCC’s chances of winning the 2015 championship are slim, the squad has been training hard. \nThe weekend tournament is set to be a great spectator event as well, including a famous gaúcho churrasco, with beef ribs barbecued over an open fire, beer and soft drinks, and in the evening a live band and DJ, and even a bonfire to celebrate Halloween. There will also be other activities for guests, including tennis, swimming and mini-golf. Ladies will also have an opportunity to take advantage of the Granado Spa, where they can get a manicure, a pedicure, or a massage. \n“The CCC is very proud to have the support of Granado as our Crown Sponsor – a long-established Rio company that produces and markets high-quality soaps, perfumes and personal hygiene products under the brand names Granado and Phebo,” Hanbury explains. “With the additional support from Austrade, this is going to be our best event ever.” \nSão Fernando P&CC is easily accessible, and is about a seventy minute bus ride from Ipanema. The CCC is arranging transport free-of-charge for anyone who would like to attend. The buses leave Praça General Osorio at 7AM and 10AM, and return to Rio de Janeiro at 7:30 PM and 10:30 PM. \n* This is a Sponsored article for the Carioca Cricket Club .
