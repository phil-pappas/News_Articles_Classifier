(Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images) The voice of the Blue Jays talks playoffs 4:27 Related Stories TEAM PAGE:Toronto Blue Jays \nIf David Price and the Toronto Blue Jays were paying attention to baseball's wild-card games Tuesday and Wednesday, they would have seen first-hand how much pitching aces affect the outcome of post-season contests. \nFirst Houston's Dallas Keuchel shut down the New York Yankees for six innings and three relievers completed a 3-0 shutout as the Astros advanced to the American League Division Series against the Kansas City Royals. Jake Arrieta of the Cubs followed with an even more dominant performance, stopping the Pirates in Pittsburgh on four hits with 11 strikeouts in a complete-game shutout, 4-0, to send Chicago to St. Louis for the NLDS. \nIt would be wise to follow those blueprints as the Blue Jays play their first post-season game in 22 years when they host the Texas Rangers on Thursday (3:37 p.m ET) in the opening game of the ALDS. Joe Carter's walk-off homer against Philadelphia won the 1993 World Series for the Blue Jays and the franchise hasn't experienced that kind of success since that memorable moment. \nPrice, 9-1 with a 2.30 ERA in 11 starts for the Blue Jays since being acquired at the trade deadline from Detroit, was tabbed by Toronto as the ace pitcher who could make the difference for a team that played .500 baseball (50-50) for the first 100 games on the season. Not only does Price get the ball for the series opener at the Rogers Centre, but he'd also be entrusted with the start should the series go to a fifth game next Wednesday. \nTexas wasn't forecasted to be playing in October but the club stunningly won the AL West after winning just 67 games in 2014. Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre swung a hot bat over the past two-plus months — .328 with 10 homers and 56 RBIs —and has five career post-season homers. \nToronto has an explosive offence but leading AL MVP candidate Josh Donaldson has struggled on the playoffs stage with no homers and no RBIs in 43 career at-bats. Price, too, has experienced his own post-season issues by going 0-5 with a 4.98 ERA in five starts. Pitching matchup Rangers RH Yovani Gallardo (13-11, 3.42 ERA) vs. Blue Jays LH David Price (18-5, 2.45) \nGallardo defeated Toronto twice this season and didn't allow a run in 13 2/3 innings — the only victories the Rangers had against the Blue Jays in six meetings. He was 2-2 with a hefty 4.85 ERA in six September starts but his success versus the Blue Jays made him the easy Game 1 call for manager Jeff Banister. \n\"I just go up there and pitch my game,\" Gallardo said in a press conference. \"They know the way I pitch. It seems like I have faced those guys throughout my career. It's not easy.\" Price will have 11 days off between starts so the possibility of early inning command issues does exist. Price won each of his final five regular-season starts but is just 3-4 with a 5.15 ERA in 11 career regular-season outings against the Rangers, and is 0-3 with a 4.66 ERA in three post-season starts versus Texas — the playoff outings coming when he pitched for the Tampa Bay Rays. Walk-offs \nBlue Jays SS Troy Tulowitzki (shoulder) is still experiencing pain but declared himself ready for the series. \nTexas LF Shin-Soo Choo was the AL Player of the Month for September, when he batted .404 with five homers and 20 RBIs. \nToronto RF Jose Bautista went 2-for-16 with a homer against the Rangers this season. Prior to the game, the Blue Jays will unfurl their 2015 AL East Division banner, the sixth in club history. Cito Gaston, manager for the Blue Jays' back-to-back World Series championships in 1992-93, will throw out the first pitch. Despite sunshine, the roof will be closed for the Blue Jays' playoff opener Thursday against the Texas Rangers, according to The Canadian Press.
