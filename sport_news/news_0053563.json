He helped broker the agreement bringing Safeway aboard as title sponsor; the tournament will become the Safeway Open in October 2016.\nWoods verbally committed to play at Silverado this year, but then he had back surgery. He’s the only member of the Turkey Eight not to come to Napa yet, as required by an agreement with tour officials. Those eight players, including Rory McIlroy , skipped the 2012 Frys.com Open for a lucrative exhibition event in Turkey.\n“I think Tiger’s going to come next year,” Miller said.\nThis year’s field was stronger than usual, with seven players in the top 30 in the world ranking. Two of them, McIlroy and Justin Rose , came to Napa because of their obligation arising from the trip to Turkey.\n“We’re going to have a nice field all the time, but you still need to have the horses,” Miller said. “ … I don’t know if Rory will come back, because he had trouble putting. He loved the course, but it might take the guys a couple of years to figure out the greens.”\nMiller supervised an extensive renovation of the North Course, with designs on attracting a tour event. He still worried a bit about long-hitting pros going crazy-low, but the winning score each of the past two years has been an altogether respectable 15-under-par.\n“I hate to make any changes, because I want the guys to get to know the course,” Miller said. “The only thing we could do is maybe grow a half-inch more rough, but I don’t think it needs that.”\nScary stuff: Tyrone Van Aswegen shot 68 and missed Sunday’s playoff by one stroke. Here’s the incredible part: One hour before his tee time, he was lying in a Napa hospital room.\nVan Aswegen, a 33-year-old South African, awoke feeling dizzy. He was diagnosed with vertigo and severe dehydration, but he still managed to complete his round — and threatened to win.\n“I was dizzy the whole round,” Van Aswegen said. “Putting was the most difficult thing. I don’t know if it was bending over and looking sideways, but I made some putts. It was weird.”\nBriefly: McIlroy tied for 26th after shooting 69. He was 71st (out of the 73 players who finished) in strokes gained/putting. … Brendan Steele , who led the tournament after each of the first three rounds, struggled mightily Sunday. He made eight bogeys on his way to shooting 76 and tied for 17th.\nRon Kroichick is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:47:42.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
