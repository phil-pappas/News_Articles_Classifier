Steve Sarkisian was fired swiftly by USC, a day after he was forced by the school's athletic director to take a leave of absence amid questions about his sobriety. Now we're learning some of the details about how the actual firing went down.\nAdChoices According to ESPN's Joe Schad, Sarkisian was en route to an out-of-state treatment facility on Monday when USC athletic director Pat Haden tried to call him to inform him of his firing. Schad reports that Sark could not answer the calls because he was on a plane, so the former Trojans coach ended up learning about his firing via friends.\nSteve Sarkisian didn’t answer Pat Haden’s calls b/c he was on a plane, en route to an out-of-state treatment facility\n— Joe Schad (@schadjoe) October 14, 2015 Steve Sarkisian learned he had been fired when he read an e-mail and text messages from friends expressing sympathy.\n— Joe Schad (@schadjoe) October 14, 2015\nSchad adds that Sarkisian is expected to spend at least 30 days in treatment.\nSarkisian was introduced as USC's new head coach in Dec. 2013 after going 34-29 during a five-year stint at Washington. He went 9-4 in his first year at USC and was 3-2 this season. The school believes Sarkisian was fired with cause , meaning they do not think they would have to pay the remaining money he is owed on his original five-year deal. It's unclear how much Sarkisian was being paid by USC, but we know Washington would have owed him at least $2.8 million last season, and his buyout at UW was $1.5 million.\nUSC's parting of ways with Sarkisian came quickly. It started when Sarkisian showed up to a team meeting Sunday and reportedly was not sober . After an avalanche of stories about his drinking problems emerged , USC decided to part ways with the coach on Monday. Sarkisian is now receiving treatment.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/schadjoe/status/654128655564587008", "https://twitter.com/schadjoe/status/654129027075014656", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/steve-sarkisian-alcohol-use-washington/277659", "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/sarkisian-kissing-off-15-million/", "https://twitter.com/schadjoe/status/654129243048181761", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/usc-steve-sarkisian-sober-special-teams-meeting/277594"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:19:56.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
