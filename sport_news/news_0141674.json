Vinson and the offense reached the first-down marker just four times in the first half. \nWithout Drummond, the Blue Tigers’ rushing attack came up with just 11 yards a week ago. \n“We have to be able to establish the run. We didn’t run the ball well at all last week,” Jones said. “Running the ball on offense and controlling the line of scrimmage is critical.” \nDrummond — who practiced in pads Wednesday for the first time all week — returning to the starting role should help. \n“He looks like he’s going to be ready to go,” Jones said. “We thought he’d be ready (last week) and it was a game-time decision. He just couldn’t go. This week where he is compared to last week is light years ahead, so we anticipate him playing.” \nThe former Missouri Tiger walk-on scored three touchdowns and averaged 27 touches in the first three weeks, before exiting at the end of the third quarter in the Week 3 loss to Quincy. \n“I think it shocked him,” Jones said of the heavy workload. “I told him he was going to play a lot, but I guess he didn’t believe me. So I guess he’s going to be like ‘Well next time you tell me something I’m going to believe you.’ But he’s going to be fine. If he’s capable of doing it, he’s going to do it. He’s a genuine enough guy that if he can’t go, he can’t go. And that’s good. Sometimes guys try and do something they know they can’t do.” \nJones clarified they’ll be careful with how they use him going forward, saying the change of weather will only make it more difficult to heal his beat-up muscles. Freshman running back Alonzo Travis and No. 2 running back Keith Lakey couldn’t find much room to work. \nTravis proved his worth in replacing Drummond at Quincy, running for 104 all-purpose yards on 14 touches, while getting nine carries for just 4 yards last week. Lakey gained 2 yards on two carries. \n“Lakey did a solid job and you look at Alonzo Travis, Alonzo played some against Quincy and he was put in gradually,” Jones said. “It wasn’t ‘You’ve got to start and be the guy.’ So, I think this week he’s a lot more prepared and understanding what it takes to be a guy that plays early in the game.” \nJordan completed 13-of-19 passes for 150 yards in his limited action. He also had a 2-yard rushing touchdown to cap off an eight-play, 75-yard drive in the fourth quarter. \nThe focus was turned to McMurry (2-2), a NCAA Division III team, after last Saturday’s loss. Senior running back Paxton Grayer is a threat. He is averaging 23.5 carries and 163 yards per game. \nDefending the run has been a struggle for the Lincoln defense. On the season, the Blue Tigers are allowing 214 yards per game and five yards per carry. \n“They have a great running back. We’re going to have to do a lot better job stopping the run,” Jones said. “We haven’t done a good job doing that.” \nMcMurry quarterback Matthew McHugh has a 54 percent throwing rate with seven touchdowns, five of which came against East Texas Baptist in the season opener. \nThe Blue Tigers expect to see multiple formations from the McMurry offense with one-back, two-back and multi-tight end sets. \n“They do a lot of different formations and personnel, but they run a lot of the same plays,” Jones said. “So they’ll try and mess with your support systems with different personnel groupings, but they run the same plays.” \nConsistency and a fast start are at the forefront of Jones’ mind ahead of today’s contest. \n“We have to control the line of scrimmage. We haven’t done it in all phases of our game in a long time,” Jones said. “We’ve been good on one side and not the other. We got to continue to play good special teams. I think our special teams have done a really good job across the board. If we play good special teams, control the line of scrimmage and control the turnovers, then we have a great chance to win. \n“We can’t get behind. We’ve been digging ourselves in holes the last three weeks. We were down three touchdowns at halftime against St. Francis. … We’ve got to get ahead, we’ve got to start off fast and when we do that, then we’ll be fine.” \nThe two teams have a common opponent in Langston. McMurry fell 32-29 to the Oklahoma team last week, while the Blue Tigers claimed a 35-32 win in their season opener. \n“We are not where we want to be, but we can still get to where we want to get to,” Jones said. “We’ve got to quit waiting until next week and make it happen this week.” \nPodcast:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:41:04.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
