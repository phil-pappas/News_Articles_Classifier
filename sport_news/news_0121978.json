By Mary Carr Mayle With the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project under way on several fronts, the most visible evidence can be seen from the beach on Tybee Island. It’s the dredge Alaska, working away some five miles offshore to deepen the shipping lane in the outer harbor.\nThe construction phase of the project kicked off in earnest earlier this year when divers began the recovery of the Civil War ironclad CSS Georgia from the bottom of the Savannah River.\nBut for most, it was the beginning of the dig – that first load of sand brought up from the river channel — that represented the culmination of more than 15 years of planning, study, sweat and tears needed to make the project a reality.\nThat moment came on Sept. 10, when Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. brought the Alaska into position, lowered its multi-bladed cutterhead and began grinding up sand, pumping it by pipeline onto a nearby barge.\nGreat Lakes, a leading North American dredging contractor, won the nearly $135 million contract to deepen the outer harbor shipping lane from 42 to 47 feet in preparation for the more massive ships expected when the new, larger Panama Canal locks are opened next year.\nThat contract calls for the company to dredge the 18.5-mile channel that extends from Fort Pulaski into the Atlantic.\nIt’s a lot like a highway construction job,” said Armand Riehl, Great Lakes project manager. “It’s just happening under water.”\nOf course, as anyone connected to Savannah’s multi-decade struggle to deepen its river would agree, it’s never really that simple.\nA dredge for all seasons\nAs part of one of the most environmentally mitigated projects in U.S. history, the dredging aspect of harbor expansion is subject to the seasonal habits of one of the area’s most valued natural resources, the loggerhead sea turtle.\nNoting that the contractor planned to use the more efficient hopper dredges in the outer channel, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Savannah District spokesman Russell Wicke originally said the earliest dredging could begin was December.\n“There is a window that prohibits hopper dredges from working in the entrance channel during much of the year to protect sea turtles,” Wicke said in July, adding that hopper dredge operation in the area would be limited to December 15 through March 31\nHowever, he said, that wouldn’t prevent other kinds of dredges from working to deepen the entrance channel during the rest of the year.\n“We were originally going to start in December with one of our hopper dredges,” Riehl said. “But when one of our cutter dredges became available in early September, we decided to go ahead and start with it. This group has been waiting so long already.”\nCutter versus hopper\nThe Alaska is a cutter suction dredge, a floating platform with an anchor at one end and an underwater rotating cutter head at the other that excavates the sea floor in a back-and-forth sweeping motion.\nThe cutter head feeds the excavated sand into a floating pipe and pump system that transports it to a nearby barge. The barge — called a spider barge because it’s equipped with spider-like arms that can be raised up — then pumps the material through its raised arms into a material barge, which is basically a huge, empty scow. When the scow is filled, it is towed to the designated dredge spoils site a mile and a half away, where it releases its load and returns for more, averaging six to seven trips a day.\nThe Alaska, which is working around the clock seven days a week, is capable of dredging between 300 and 400 feet of channel daily, removing the equivalent of 1,400 dump truck loads of sand every 24 hours.\nWhile the cutter dredge requires several other pieces of equipment to complete its task, the hopper dredge looks and functions more like a self-contained, self-propelled ship. Hopper dredges are designed to vacuum material from the sea floor through 6 to 8-foot wide drag arms that load it into the hold - or hopper - of the vessel. The cargo of sand can then be sailed to the ocean disposal site, where it is dumped through openings in the bottom of its hull.\nA hopper dredge moves at between 1.5 and 2 knots, covering more ground in a 24-hour period than a cutter dredge.\nThe hopper dredges Great Lakes expects to employ can dredge 5,000 feet of channel daily, moving the equivalent of 450 dump truck loads of sand every 24 hours.\nUnlike the cutter dredge, a hopper dredge is self-propelled and can easily move out of the way of cargo ships, a major advantage when working in the shipping channel of the fourth largest container port in the country, Riehl said.\nThe turtle conundrum\nThe different ways in which the two dredges operate makes the cutter much safer for sea turtles, said Jack Winn, quality control engineer for the project.\n“Historically, mechanical and hydraulic dredges, such as cutters, do not have issues with turtles,” he said. “With a cutter operation, the cutter head is buried down in the sand. It’s moving slowly and making a lot of commotion, giving turtles plenty of opportunity to get out of its way.\n“Hoppers, because they move faster and skim along the surface, tend to encounter more turtles,” he said. “That’s why they are environmentally restricted to the winter months here when water temperatures significantly reduce the number of turtles in the area.”\nRiehl said he expected the Alaska to be available into November. In December, the company will switch to one of its trailing suction hopper dredges – most likely the Padre Island or the Dodge Island, returning to cutters in April.\nGreat Lakes’ contract calls for the project to be completed no later than July 2018 although Riehl said the dredging is already ahead of schedule and should be done before then.\nABOUT THE COMPANY\nFounded in 1890 and headquartered in Oak Brook, Ill., Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp. (NASDAQ:GLDD) is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States and the only U.S. dredging company with significant international operations.\nThe company is also a significant provider of environmental and remediation services. Great Lakes employs more than 150 degreed engineers and also owns and operates the largest and most diverse fleet in the U.S. dredging industry, comprised of over 200 specialized vessels.\nAmong its notable projects are the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill cleanup, Diyar al Muharraq reclamation in Bahrain and the PortMiami harbor deepening. Great Lakes is no stranger to this area, having completed harbor maintenance for the ports of Savannah, Charleston and Brunswick as well as last year’s Tybee beach renourishment project.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:15:29.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
