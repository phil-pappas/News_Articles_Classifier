He is 6-foot-3, 220 pounds; runs the 100, 200 and 400 meters as well as long jumps in outdoor track and he loves to sack quarterbacks. “You usually don’t see a defensive end doing that kind of stuff in track,” Hendricken football coach Keith Croft said about Paye, the Hawks junior defensive end and sometimes running back. “We have had a lot of outstanding athletes over the years, but in terms of Kwity, he is a rare breed,” Croft added. Rare indeed: he's so special that — even though he’s only a junior — a member of the Boston College coaching staff stopped in last week at a Hendricken practice just to see Paye work. A coach from a major college football program coming to watch a high school junior practice doesn’t normally happen in Rhode Island. “I didn’t even know he was coming. It surprised me,” said Croft of the BC coaching visit. It was one more chapter in what has become an amazing saga of the fulfillment of a mother’s dream because of football. He came to America when he was six months old from a refugee camp in Guinea, where his mother had fled to escape the atrocities of a civil war in her native Liberia. He grew up in South Providence and, while many young people in his community were playing soccer, he never seriously kicked a soccer ball. “My mother had run track in her native country so the first thing I did was run in a track program when I was five years old,” said Paye. “Then my stepfather started me and my brother in football when I was seven.” He immediately fell in love with football. “It was fun,” said Paye. “Every kid likes to chase people around and have fun.” He now knows that the fun game of his youth also helped formulate his future. “It was good. It kept me off the streets when I was a kid and it teaches you how to work with others,” Paye offered about football. Growing up he always was bigger than most of his peers, and he was fast. So it’s not surprising his main focus during his youth football days was running back. But last season the Hendricken coaching staff decided his future in football was more about keeping points off the scoreboard than scoring touchdowns. “One thing we try to do, especially for a kid like him, is envision down the road,” said Croft. “We felt with Kwity, he is going to be a defensive player in college.” Page 2 of 3 - “I’m not saying he is an NFL player. But when you look at NFL pass-rushers that’s what they are looking for: size, speed, athleticism. Coming off the end he has those types of characteristics.” So Paye became a starting defensive end last season as a sophomore and right from the beginning he was a force. One of his best performances of the season came in the Division I Super Bowl where he helped Hendricken defeat previously undefeated La Salle. “Right after the Super Bowl, URI contacted us and said they were interested,” said Croft. “That was the start.” By last spring, UMass was paying heavy attention and interest began coming from outside New England. “The word is definitely out,” said Croft. “We never have had a player get this much attention so early in his career,” said Croft. “I was on the staff when Will Blackmon was here. Will had a big summer between his junior and senior years. There wasn’t a lot attention until his senior season,” added Croft, who now is in his eighth year as the Hawks head coach and 20th season as a member of the coaching staff. Paye knows more people are now watching him, dissecting his every move. “I just try to focus on the game and get the job done,” said Paye. “I know this season I need to work on being more aggressive. I think that helps on defense. I like being a pass rusher.” He still sees some duty in the Hendricken offensive backfield, but Croft tries to limit the number of times he calls on Paye to both stop runners and also run with the ball. But there are times when the coaching staff can’t avoid giving Paye the ball. Like last Friday night when Cumberland scored a field goal in its first possession of overtime giving Hendricken four chances to score from the 10-yard line or suffer its first defeat of the season. You didn’t need to be the second coming of Bill Belichick to figure Paye was going to get the ball on one of those four chances. Sure enough, on the second play of the series, Paye took the ball and ran four yards, off-tackle, for the game-winning touchdown. “He has a little more prominent role on offense this season, said Croft. “But while you want kids to try and win a championship, especially for someone like him, as coaches it is our job to deliver him to the college level in the best position we can.” Through it all, Paye has not lost sight that the tackles and the quarterbacks sacks are leading to the fulfillment of his mother’s dream when she came to America. Page 3 of 3 - “My mother’s dream was to have her sons go to college so they can have a better life,” said Paye. “Now I might get a free college education.” Some of the most important achievements don’t show up on the stat sheet. —jgillool@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:07:27.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
