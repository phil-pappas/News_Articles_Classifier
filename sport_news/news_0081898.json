It's been something of an obsession. But in spite of the Internet's illusion that absolutely everything in the history of recorded music has been unearthed and digitally restored, the tireless souls at Mosaic Records introduced me to the surprisingly neglected Bee Hive label.\nPianist Roland Hanna and Ed Wiley play during the \"Sassy\" session in Brooklyn in 2001. ( Efasax ) \"The Complete Bee Hive Sessions\" consists of 12 CDs of music that I, and perhaps you, had no knowledge of whatsoever. Between 1977 and 1984, married couple Jim and Susan Neumann, who had made their living in the world of lighting fixtures, decided to put together a jazz label to document musicians whose styles they liked. This was essentially how the iconic Blue Note label began, but in spite of the Neumanns' top-tier roster of musicians and stellar performances committed to tape and vinyl, Bee Hive didn't have the staying power of other, better-remembered independents.\nMost of the artists signed to Bee Hive were proven journeymen: vocalist Johnny Hartman, saxophonists Clifford Jordan and Nick Brignola, brass players Dizzy Reece and Curtis Fuller and expressive pianists such as Roland Hanna, Ronnie Matthews and Junior Mance.\nAdvertisement Everyone was given creative freedom in the studio. And while most of the music stuck to standards, blues and hard bop structures, there was an undeniable freshness and sense of purpose to nearly everything produced at the label. Fuller's \"Fire And Filigree,\" Reece's \"Manhattan Project\" and Jordan's \"Hyde Park After Dark\" rank with the most satisfying straight-ahead jazz recordings of the era â€” even though very few would have known about them then.\nIn the sets' (typically superb for Mosaic) liner notes, Susan Neumann said that the majority of these recordings didn't break even financially upon their release, but, nonetheless, she wished that they could have gone on forever. Forever is a long time, but perhaps the reintroduction of this music, in all of its sincerity and enthusiasm, will be granted some well-deserved acknowledgement.
