Reader"], "text": "#10 6-0, 241Anderson, SC View Full Profile said Reader will bring experience as the Tigers begin their stretch run, including playing four of their last six games away from Death Valley. \n“He just brings in more leadership and experience. He's been there and done that,” Boulware said. “He's been here for years and knows what he's doing. He took a little time off for just personal stuff, but he's been working out and he's stayed in shape. I saw him this morning when we were working out. I think he will be fine. He just brings in extra knowledge, experience and leadership. I think our young guys have done a good job being prepared every week, but he brings more depth to our defensive line.” \nSwinney said he hopes Reader can finish strong. \n“We found out Thursday, I believe, that he’s ready to rejoin us and I am excited about that. We will get back to work on Monday,” Swinney said. “I have no idea what to expect. I have no idea where he is football wise. He hasn’t even practiced, much less played. But the team is excited to have him back and we’ll get him out there and see where he is. He has done some training – not here – but I know he has been working out and doing some things. He’s excited to get back out there. Hopefully he can have a strong, positive finish to his senior season.” Rate this Story: Send Feedback to David Hood: Email | Comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:35:43.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
