Ten months after being one half away from winning the College Football Playoff national championship, the Ducks reached 3-3 for the first time since 2004 by losing to a Washington State team that had started the season with a home defeat to — gulp — Portland State.\n\"We had a couple opportunities on offense to finish the game and just couldn't quite put the nail in the coffin, so to speak,\" coach Mark Helfrich said.\nMark down this finish as one Oregon (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) will want omitted from the history book.\nThe Ducks led 31-21 with 8:20 remaining in regulation and the fans who hadn't already been chased away by the intermittent downpours would have been safe thinking they could bolt to the parking lot. Oregon had won 100 straight games when leading by 10 points, dating to 2005.\nBut quietly, slowly, Washington State (3-2, 1-1) began its comeback. Less than an hour later — after Oregon couldn't convert on third-and-two, and gave the ball back to WSU with 1:58 remaining; after the Cougars scored the tying touchdown with one second left in regulation; after a bizarre touchdown gave them the lead in double-OT; after a Jeff Lockie interception on fourth down ended the game — Cougars coaches sprinted out of their press box office, all hugs and high-fives, toward the elevators so as to join the celebration as quickly as possible.\n\"You can pick on one thing if you want but that game should have been over well before (overtime),\" offensive coordinator Scott Frost said. \"We had a chance to end the game with a first down, and we had them where we wanted them with five minutes left in the game but we didn't finish.\"\nScott Frost talks about QB rotation after loss to WSU Frost also talked about one particular play and about play calling, especially near the end of regulation.\nAfter two straight home losses, the question becomes how this Oregon season will finish.\nThe Ducks travel next week to suddenly resurgent Washington, riding high and with extra rest after knocking off USC on the road Thursday night, before entering what was expected to be their toughest stretch: at Arizona State, at home versus Cal, at Stanford, at home against USC.\nAt some point they will get quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. back, but one player won't be the cure. The same could be said for the insertion of Charles Nelson into the starting lineup at safety, a move he admitted he was \"skeptical\" of at first.\nNelson played well going three ways, joining in at receiver and on special teams, too, with his 12 tackles leading the Ducks. And with seven sacks and 13 tackles for loss, Oregon's front-four played its best game.\nBut they couldn't hold back the floodgates entirely. Washington State scored on its last drive to end the first and second halves, late scores that allowed the Cougars to snap an eight-game losing streak to Oregon, and leave the Ducks in an Oregon Trail-sized rut moving forward.\n\"We definitely let that one get away from us at home,\" said Lockie, who earned the start and completed 13-of-22 passes for two touchdowns, 123 yards and the interception. \"It hurts.\"\nMark Helfrich press conference after 45-38 OT loss to WSU Helfrich talked about missing chances to finish the game in regulation and about the quarterback rotation.\nWasted in the loss will be Royce Freeman's career-high 246 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries, and 46 receiving yards and a touchdown. With Oregon's passing game again struggling, UO leaned on Freeman like never before, and he held tough by accounting for nearly 55 percent of Oregon's total offense by himself.\nBut after taking the 10-point lead, Oregon pulled both Freeman and Lockie for reserves Kani Benoit and Taylor Alie, and UO went three-and-out on the ensuing series. WSU turned around and got a field goal to cut its deficit to a touchdown. Alie, Frost and Helfrich said, gave Oregon a better runner in their effort of running down the clock on the ground.\n\"In our mind I think if a quarterback can pull it and get a first down we can end the game,\" Frost said.\nBut Oregon went three-and-out on its next drive, as well, with Lockie and Freeman back in, giving WSU the ball with 1:58 remaining after Freeman couldn't get the two yards he needed on third down.\n\"That definitely turned the game,\" Frost said.\nTwelve plays and 70 yards later, quarterback Luke Falk, who finished with 505 passing yards and five touchdowns with zero interceptions, found Dom Williams in the corner of the end zone on a fade route to tie the score at 31. Twice on the drive, the Cougars converted third downs of at least 10 yards.\n\"I'm pretty confident we were out of position on both of those,\" defensive coordinator Don Pellum said.\nIncredibly, the knife was twisted even deeper in overtime.\nWith Oregon ahead by a touchdown, and the Cougars facing fourth-and-1 from two yards out, running back Jamal Morrow was stopped at the one-foot line. The Ducks thought they'd escaped and burst off the sideline in celebration — prematurely, it turned out. The ball was measured and the first down awarded. The game would follow soon after.\n\"They probably wanted it more,\" safety Tyree Robinson said of WSU's pair of half-ending touchdown drives. \"The quarterback, he's been getting hit all game. When it came to crunch time he stood in the pocket and made some quarterback sneaks and the running back is running the ball well. We played a great game. I'm very proud of my defensive team and the offense — but you have to finish.\"\n-- Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com", "external_links": ["http://player.performgroup.com/eplayer.js#ae44930f27386fb52dd3dd6af7.kren2iwlgrur1tm6buszdhrsh.s"], "published": "2015-10-11T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:16:31.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
