Several of the Indians are using the head gear and more will use it as the season wears on. \nThe impacts of head injuries and brain damage from athletic competition is something administrators and coaches worry about and deal with. \nBut Montrose High School is taking pre-emptive steps to protect the Indian football team. \nSeveral of the Indians are wearing Guardian Caps. This is an outer shell worn around the helmet to help reduce the impacts from violent collisions. \n“Getting these Guardian Caps is the result of us doing as much as we can to reduce the possibility of concussions in young players,” Montrose Athletic Director Lyle Wright said. “It’s a precautionary measure, but it is well worth the investment.” \nThe Guardian Cap is a one-size fits all helmet cover that can be worn on any current football or lacrosse helmet. It reduces the force of impact by increasing the time of deceleration upon impact. \nWright said he has researched the caps and talked to other administrators about them. \n“Colorado Mesa University is wearing them, and the Jeffco School district, the largest in the state, is using them,” he said. “I talked to the district A.D. and he said they did years of research on how to prevent head injuries and the caps were a good purchase.” \nIndian Football Coach Jim Scarry said the caps are a solid investment. \n“In today’s world we have to do everything we can to keep the kids safe,” he said. “If a player has had an injury they have to wear one, but many of the kids want to wear them so we will have more kids wearing them as time goes on.” \nScarry said he hasn’t researched the caps himself, but believes they will help. \n“The way we see head injuries and how they are treated has changed so much,” he said. “I’ve been in this game 30-some years, but back when I started we didn’t have the knowledge about brain injuries we have today.” \nScarry said the way coaches are teaching players to tackle has changed along with the technology. \n“Back in my day, we were taught to lead with our helmets, that was part of the game,” he said. “But my dad taught to tackle without leading with my head, so I have never coached any players to do that. It’s just not safe.” \nWright said the ultimate goal is to keep players playing. \n“We have had some concussions, but not a lot, but one is too many,” he said. “We will do whatever we can to keep the kids on the field and playing because that is what they want to do. We just have to make it as safe as possible.” More from our site", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:00:38.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
