BALTIMORE – Joe Girardi called the 2015 regular season “as much of a grind” as any he’s experienced in a baseball lifetime.\n“There was probably as much uncertainty, even on a daily basis,” Girardi said of managing the club’s aging sluggers, losing all five starting pitchers to the disabled list during the season, balancing a bullpen and still earning a postseason berth.\n“So, I think this was probably as rewarding as any club that I’ve been on that made the playoffs.”\nBefore the Yankees get to Tuesday’s wild card, there are still three final games at Camden Yards.\nFriday night’s rainout forced today’s day-night doubleheader. Ivan Nova is set to start the noon opener against the Orioles, while Luis Severino is tentatively scheduled to start the 7 p.m. nightcap.\nEntering Friday, the Yankees needed either a victory or a Houston Astros loss to secure hosting the wild-card game against the Astros, Angels or Twins.\n“We want to play at home. I think that’s the big thing for us,” third baseman Chase Headley said.\nBut as they enter the postseason for the first time since 2012, \nGirardi guides a high-priced club into a tournament in which they’re a considerable long shot.\nThe manager asks, essentially, “What’s new?”\n“I think we’ve been the underdog since Game 1 of the season in our division,” Girardi said.\n“I saw some publications where we were picked last. That’s OK because you have to go out and play the games.”\nMasahiro Tanaka is lined up for Tuesday’s wild card start, though he’s not been named officially.\n“I’m working myself so that I’m ready on that day,” Tanaka said through his interpreter.\nAfter nearly a two-week layoff because of a hamstring strain, Tanaka wasn’t sharp early in Wednesday’s five-inning start against the Red Sox.\nBut Tanaka said his leg is “good, maybe even better,” than Wednesday, and he’s revved up about his first MLB playoff experience.\n“It’s a do-or-die game,” Tanaka said. “So, it’s definitely going to be something very exciting.”\nIn the afterglow of Thursday’s clinching champagne celebration, the Yankees plotted the weekend course on a gloomy Inner Harbor afternoon.\n“The most important thing … is to clinch the home field for [Tuesday],” Girardi said of the Yanks’ best path to a division series, against either Toronto or Kansas City.\nGirardi won’t play any one player in both of today’s games, minimizing the risk of injury and fatigue.\nSo, Alex Rodriguez will serve as designated hitter once today.\nHeadley and Jacoby Ellsbury are improved after sitting out Thursday’s game with back issues; each will play one game today as well.\nEllsbury banged into the fence on a catch Wednesday but said Thursday he was available.\nHeadley’s back “just got a little tight” and “we wanted to make sure it didn’t turn into” something worse.\n“I definitely want some at-bats this weekend,” Headley said.\nAs for his essential late-relief tandem, Girardi figures closer Andrew Miller and lefty Justin Wilson could each work an inning to keep them sharp, but he’d use Dellin Betances “very sparingly,” if at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:30.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
