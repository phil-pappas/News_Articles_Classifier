After a scoreless first quarter in Friday's Class 2, District 6 Tournament first-round game in Palmyra, the Panthers exploded for 22 points in the second en route to a 35-0 victory over Montgomery County. Palmyra (8-2) got going with 10:26 left in the first half when junior tailback Clayton Hudson scored from 14 yards out. Senior Ben Cheffey added to the lead with a long, 92-yard rushing score to push the lead to 13-0 before senior running back Phillip Bland made it a 19-0 ballgame on a 19-yard streak to the end zone. Sophomore Noah Mencer's 37-yard field goal in the final seconds of the first half closed out the first-half. Bland and sophomore Peyton Plunkett each scored on runs of 13 yards in the third quarter to account for the final score. Palmyra finished with 467 yards of total offense, with 441 of those coming on the ground. Plunkett paced the Panthers with 123 yards on just six carries, while Bland added 102 on eight and Hudson 84 on 15. Cheffey finished with 74 yards on six carries.

Mark Twain turns away Chaffee behind rushing attack: The Chaffee High School football team got to enjoy a close game for about 14 minutes of Friday's Class 1, District 1 Tournament opener in Center. After Mark Twain High School took the first lead on a Tyler Elledge 60-yard run, Chaffee responded with a Landon Tenkhoff 7-yard run with 2:02 left in the first quarter. Then, from there, it was all MTHS. The Tigers (10-0) scored 41 unanswered points on two more touchdowns from Elledge, three from Caleb Hirner and a scoring-clincher by Terry Monroe. Elledge, a senior running back, rushed for 226 yards on nine carries to pace Mark Twain, who totaled 375 total yards via the rush. Hirner, a junior tailback, added 70 yards on 10 carries, and Monroe chipped in 50 yards on eight touches. Elledge gave his team some breathing room with a 57-yard scoring run with 10:44 to go in the first half that made it a 14-6 Tigers lead. Hirner then scored back-to-back-to-back touchdowns of 24, 14 and one yards, respectively â€“ all in the second quarter, as MTHS erupted for 28 points in the quarter for a 35-6 cushion. Elledge added an 80-yard touchdown run for good measure 14 seconds into the third quarter before Monroe's 4-yard score ended the outburst with (;13 left in the contest. Junior linebacker Brandon Hamilton had a team-high 10 tackles for the Tigers, while senior Walker Sharp added seven. Brady Hooley, a junior defensive back, reeled in an interception and returned it 43 yards. Page 2 of 2 - Mark Twain will meet the winner of Barat Academy and Monroe City on Oct. 30 in Center.
