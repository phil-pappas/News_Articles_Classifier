(AP) — Mark Iannotti passed for three touchdowns and rushed for one as Southern Illinois raced to a 73-26 win over Missouri State on Saturday. \nSouthern Illinois (2-3, 1-1 Missouri Valley) rushed for 416 yards — the most since recording 435 in 2009 — and finished with 673 total yards, the second time they've totaled at least 600 this season. \nIanotti's 61-yard touchdown run on the second play of the game set the tone for things to come, as the Salukis tallied 38 points by halftime, including all four of Iannoti's touchdowns. He was 13 of 20 for 206 yards and had 106 yards on six carries. Chris Perkins added 116 yards and two touchdowns on six carries. \nJason Randall scored on runs of 4 and 2 yards for Missouri State (1-4, 0-2), and Malik Earl caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Brodie Lambert in the second quarter.
