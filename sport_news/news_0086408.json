So how did he spend his time?\n“I’ve been sitting in the hot tub, just chilling,” Brown said with a smile after Wednesday’s practice. “[There wasn’t] really anything I could treat or anything to speed up the process.\n“I got on the elliptical a little bit, I got on the [anti-gravity] treadmill, but that’s been the last couple days. Before that, I was just chilling in the hot tub.”\nBut Wednesday, rather than sitting in the hot tub or jogging on the elliptical, Brown participated in portions of practice for the first time since suffering the injury. And while it was non-contact, it was a first step the second-year guard was very happy to take.\n“It is nice to get back on the court and move around, get into the plays a little bit,” Brown said. “Just watching on the sidelines, it looks like you’ve got it, but actually being on the court you’ve got to react a different way, so it feels good being out there.”\nBrown said he plans to ramp up each of the next few days, beginning with some one-on-one games before practice Thursday, and hopes to be back fully practicing and ready to go by this weekend, giving him a few days to go before the start of the regular season.\nCoach Lionel Hollins was asked about Jarrett Jack being named a potential future coach by some of the league’s general managers for NBA.com’s annual survey. But Hollins said that, from his own experience, it’s foolish for anyone to try and map out who is going to be a coach while they’re playing.\n“I don’t even think about that,” Hollins said. “That’s for you guys [to decide].\n“Nobody knew I could be a coach. I didn’t think about coaching until I quit playing. I went and tried to get another job and didn’t get hired. I went and tried to get another job and didn’t get hired. So I said, ‘What the [bleep] else do I know?’ I know basketball, so I went to university and became a coach.”\nHollins made it clear his response had nothing to do with Jack, one of the more respected players in the league, but he pointed out what has happened with Jason Kidd as an example of how it’s hard to tell how things are going to work out.\n“Coaching is different than playing,” he said. “There’s a lot of great players that can’t be good coaches. You look at a guy like Jason Kidd, he stepped right in and didn’t miss a beat.\n“Did anybody think that was possible when he played? I know when he got hired nobody thought it but the team that hired him, so who knows.\n“You can be the smartest player on the court, you can be the greatest leader on the court, but when you have to go out there and sit and watch them lead, it’s totally different.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brooklyn nets ,  jarrett jack ,  lionel hollins ,  markel brown", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:21:18.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
