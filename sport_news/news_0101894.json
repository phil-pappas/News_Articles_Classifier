As a team, the Cubs hit six home runs in the game. Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press Chicago Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant (17) broke out the lumber with a two-run home run and went 2-for-5 with two RBIs in Game 3 against St. Louis. As a team, the Cubs hit six home runs in the game. C HICAGO The young sluggers of the Chicago Cubs are making themselves at home in the playoffs. On a rare off night for Jake Arrieta, the Windy City rookies bashed their way to the brink of the National League Championship Series. Jorge Soler, Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber connected during a six-home run show for the Cubs, who beat the St. Louis Cardinals 8-4 on Monday for a 2-1 lead in the NL Division Series. Arrieta struck out nine before departing in the sixth inning, and the bullpen finished the job in the first postseason game at Wrigley Field in seven years. A third consecutive win for the Cubs on Tuesday afternoon, and the once woebegone franchise will advance to the NLCS for the first time in 12 years. The Cardinals, who led the majors with 100 wins this season, have won at least one playoff series in each of the last four years. Jason Hammel will start at home in Game 4. John Lackey, who won the opener, pitches for the Cardinals. Jason Heyward and Stephen Piscotty homered for St. Louis, which got to Arrieta for four runs in his worst start in four months. But the Cardinals were unable to keep the Cubs in the ballpark. The six homers for Chicago set a franchise record for a playoff game, one more than its total from Game 1 of the 1984 NLCS against San Diego. The Cardinals trailed 8-4 before Piscotty hit a two-run shot with two out in the ninth, a scary moment for a towel-waving crowd of 42,411 used to playoff heartache. But Hector Rondon retired Matt Holliday on a harmless bouncer to second, and the party was on. Arrieta improved to 18-1 with a 1.00 earned-run average in his last 22 starts dating to June 21, but he was far from his usual dominant self. He hadn’t allowed more than three runs in a game since a June 16 loss to Cleveland. And it didn’t matter, not one bit. Schwarber, Starlin Castro and Bryant homered against Michael Wacha in his first playoff appearance since he threw the final pitch of the 2014 postseason for the Cardinals, a game-ending, three-run shot for Travis Ishikawa in the NLCS against the Giants. Bryant’s two-run drive made it 4-2 with one out in the fifth and chased Wacha in favor of Kevin Siegrist. But Anthony Rizzo followed another long ball, a drive to right for his first hit of the playoffs. Even Adam Wainwright got into the act, serving up Soler’s two-run shot in the sixth. Soler, who struggled with injuries for much of the year, is 4 for 4 with two homers, four RBIs and five walks in the series. The final homer for Chicago went to Dexter Fowler, practically an elder statesman in Joe Maddon’s youthful lineup. Fowler doesn’t turns 30 until March, but Soler, Bryant, Rizzo, Schwarber and Castro are all 26 or younger. Blue Jays 8, Astros 4 ARLINGTON, Texas – The Toronto Blue Jays went deep early and used a pair of Cy Young winners to force a deciding Game 5 in the AL Division Series. Josh Donaldson and Chris Colabello hit home runs before 40-year-old knuckleballer R.A. Dickey threw his first postseason pitch, and the Blue Jays won 8-4 in Game 4 on Monday to send the series back to Toronto. Game 5 is Wednesday. Cole Hamels will start for the Rangers against Marcus Stroman in a rematch from Game 2, which Texas won in 14 innings. After losing the first two games in the series at home, the Blue Jays won both games in Texas in a span of 24 hours. Dickey, the 2012 NL Cy Young winner, allowed one run over 4 2/3 innings and was pulled with a 7-1 lead and a runner on base. Then 2012 AL Cy Young winner David Price took over and pitched three innings, getting the win after losing in the opener. Kevin Pillar also connected as three of the first eight Toronto hitters homered off Derek Holland, in his first postseason start since 8 1/3 scoreless innings against St. Louis in Game 4 of the 2011 World Series. Royals 9, Astros 6 HOUSTON – Astros shortstop Carlos Correa couldn’t handle a deflected grounder that might have been a double-play ball, helping the Kansas City Royals rally for five runs in the eighth inning to beat Houston 9-6 on Monday and force their playoff series to a decisive Game 5. Correa homered twice, doubled, singled and drove in four runs in Game 4 of the AL Division Series. Houston took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but a tough error charged to the 21-year-old rookie keyed the Royals’ comeback to even the matchup at two games apiece. Game 5 will be Wednesday back in Kansas City. Late in the game, a tweet from the account of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott congratulated the Astros on advancing to the AL Championship Series. But the defending AL champion Royals had other ideas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:21:30.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
