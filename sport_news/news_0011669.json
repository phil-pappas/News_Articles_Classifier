I've become good friends with them. You talk with them a little more, and get to know each other. Definitely on the ice, the more you practice with each other get to know each other's tendencies.\" \nPrince, a skill guy, said he has developed a bond with Neil, who celebrated his 900th game with a goal, and assist and a fight. \n\"It was real special for him and it was just great to be a part of it,\" said Prince. \"Me and him have played well together, we've played a lot of pre-season games together too, and seem to score pretty much every game. So if we can keep that going, and keep this line going, it's good for the team.\" \nPrince acknowledged discovering he has more room on the ice with Neil as a linemate. \n\"I've watched Neiler since I was a kid, I know he always has his teammates backs, so I'm definitely not concerned there,\" said Prince. \"I definitely can hold my own, but I know if anything happens, I'm protected out there.\" \nOverhearing this, Neil laughed and recounted a scrum in which he, Smith and Prince were involved - and Prince accidentally punched Smith. \nIn the penalty box, Smith asked Neil why. \n\"That's what happens when you close your eyes and swing,\" Neil said, laughing. \n-- Don Brennan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:36:14.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
