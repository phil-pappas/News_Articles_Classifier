(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) \nWASHINGTON — The Redskins will face off against a second straight NFC East opponent this week in the Philadelphia Eagles. The performance against the Giants last week left a lot to be desired. The weather this week could do the same. With possibly rainy and windy conditions expected, this could benefit the Redskins because it might slow down the Eagles’ offensive attack. Chip Kelly and Philadelphia like to spread out the offense and do it at a quick pace, which the rain might dampen. Here are some things to watch for this week. \nSecondary health \nThis could be an issue come Sunday. Cornerback DeAngelo Hall is already out with a toe injury and Chris Culliver hasn’t practiced all week. Culliver’s officially listed as questionable and Jay Gruden is optimistic he can play despite not having practiced. Field conditions and weather will factor into whether he plays and how effective he can be. \nIf Culliver doesn’t play, then the cornerbacks this week will be Bashaud Breeland, Will Blackmon and Quinton Dunbar. Blackmon was signed last week to provide some depth and Dunbar, signed from the practice squad this week, is a converted wide receiver. Luckily, Sam Bradford isn’t a real dynamic quarterback and doesn’t scare a lot of people, but a shallow secondary could make for a long day. Stay tuned. \nTurnovers \nKirk Cousins threw two interceptions last week and Matt Jones fumbled through the end zone. All three cost the Redskins in the loss to the Giants. They can’t afford to keep turning the ball over and expect to win games. As Jay Gruden said last week, he couldn’t believe they had ever won a game being minus five in the turnover differential. Ball protection is even more important this week because of the weather. They practiced outside this week and in the bubble, but also worked with a heavy, wet football and did a number of things to prepare for the rain. \nSpecial Teams \nLet’s just say this unit hasn’t really been the highlight of the season. Yes, there have been injuries to key members of the special teams units, but that can’t account for everything. The Redskins had a punt blocked last week on their first possession and have already released a kicker and had a kick returned for a touchdown. This week they will have to contain Darren Sproles, who returned a kick 89-yards for a touchdown last week. This unit needs to improve and do so quickly. \nRunning game \nThe Redskins have made it known that they want to be a running team and Gruden likes to have a run first identity. \n“I think that running football teams like to play in the rain, I guess,” he said this week. “We like to think of ourselves as a little bit of both. It can benefit us. They’re a running team also. I know that they like to run the ball also, so it could benefit them.” \nThe team has worked hard this week on holding onto the football. Matt Jones has two fumbles this year, and last week’s happened on the way into the end zone, costing Washington a touchdown. This is one of the biggest factors this week. Whichever team can establish the run and not be forced to throw 40-50 times should win the game. \nWeather \nThis could take you back to an old school NFC East battle. If the rain and wind are a factor it will be interesting to see which team can execute its game plan the best, not turn the ball over and come away with a win. \nBoth teams are 1-2 and the loser will drop to the bottom of the division. This will tell us a lot about the Redskins and their ability to bounce back from last weeks loss on the road. It’s an important game, being both in the division and at home. If this team has indeed turned the corner and think they are headed in the right direction, then following up the loss with a good performance Sunday would be an important step. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP.
