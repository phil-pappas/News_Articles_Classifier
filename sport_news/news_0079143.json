We've got some good content for video.\"\nAlthough Blandisi's goal came with Albany a man up, the Devils' power play was one of the main culprits.\nFormer Devils defenseman Mark Fraser took a double minor for Binghamton early in the second period — two minutes for roughing ex-teammate Mike Sislo , and two more for quibbling with referee David Banfield — but Albany didn't capitalize.\nThe Devils had another opportunity less than a minute after Fraser left the penalty box, but they failed to cash in.\n\"When you get six minutes of power play and don't get a goal, that was a huge confidence builder for them,\" said goaltender Yann Danis , who made 28 saves in his Albany debut. \"For them to get that late goal in the second changed the momentum.\"\nThe goal was the result of a 2-on-1 break, finished when O'Dell took a pass from Tobias Lindberg to break a 1-1 tie.\nDavid Dziurzynski was left alone in the slot early in the third to make it 3-1, and, as Danis said, \"We weren't the same after that.\"\nThe Devils did hold a 33-32 edge in shots on goal but were outshot 12-5 in the third, when they were trying to come from behind and forcing offense.\n\"All those goals were very preventable,\" Kowalsky said. \"It was just guys out of position, guys playing together for the first time, a lot of these guys. But we have to be a lot tighter in our own end than that.\"\nThe Devils had five rookies in the lineup, including Blandisi, who led the Ontario Hockey League with 52 goals last season.\nIt was easy to see why after he fired a shot that hit Binghamton defenseman Fredrik Claesson and ricocheted into the net.\n\"It was a good feeling when it first happened,\" Blandisi said. \"It tied the game up at 1 there, but it's not as good when you lose.\"\n\"He's got a knack for the net,\" Kowalsky said. \"That's a goal scorer's goal. ... He has the ability to score. The big thing is him committing and playing a 200-foot game.\"\nSENATORS 4, DEVILS 1\nAlbany 1 0 0 — 1\nBinghamton 1 1 2 — 4\nFirst period — 1, Binghamton, Greening 1 (Mullen, Paul), 9:48 (pp), 2, Albany, Blandisi 1 (Gragnani), 13:46 (pp).
