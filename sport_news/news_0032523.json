In the third quarter, it scored 10 straight points to take a 17-0 advantage into the final quarter.After a Cass field goal midway through the fourth quarter, Sequoyah put the game away on a 41-yard touchdown pass from Austin Tracy to Derrion Rakestraw.The Colonels were then driving with 5:23 left in the game, but Brooks Morris intercepted Cass quarterback Trevor Lowe and returned the ball to the Colonels’ 6-yard line.Sequoyah’s defense smothered the Cass backs and forced the Colonels to throw. Although Lowe did throw for 188 yards, the Chiefs forced him into 19 incompletions and the interception.Teter said Sequoyah’s defensive success didn’t surprise him.“We felt like, coming in, that our defense could have some success against them,” Teter said. “Although you might not know it from our record, our defense has played well all season. Our offense has just put the defense in some tough situations, but they came through big (Friday).”After a scoreless first quarter, Sequoyah’s Cameron Gales scored from 1 yard out with 1:30 left in the half, and Ethan Riggle’s extra point gave Sequoyah a 7-0 lead.Riggle then stretched Sequoyah’s lead to 10-0 on his 32-yard field goal at the 7:13 mark of the third quarter.Gales scored on a 2-yard run with 1:21 remaining in the third quarter, and Riggle’s extra point gave the Chiefs a 17-0 lead. After Cass got on the board with a 41-yard field goal from Brandon Romero, the Chiefs scored their final touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:02:30.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
