Besides this, the board had cancelled English tests at 69 examinations centres after UMC cases on a large scale. A majority of such centres were located in the National Capital Region—Mewat, Palwal, Sonepat, Rohtak, Bhiwani and Rewari. On September, 29, flying squads registered 495 cheating cases in English exam and 436 UMC’s on October 1. One teacher on exam duty at Sampla centre was relieved from duties on this count. Sources said that though Section 144 had been imposed within 200 metre radius of the centre to thwart attempts of supply cheating material from outside but an assembly of hundreds of youth, especially in rural areas, is a common sight. One of the teachers on exam duty confided that they too want to maintain the sanctity of board exams but are vulnerable against a crowd of people aiding cheating. Policemen too were indifferent in such cases. Wazir Singh Ghanghas, state president of Haryana Vidhyala Adhyapak Sangh, blamed the state and education board of going soft on this issue. “If they are serious, they can have cheating free exams but education is at the bottom in priority list,” he said. A board spokesperson said that a huge manpower is at work to conduct smooth examinations and the department was cracking its whip on cheating. More than 220 flying squads have been constituted, 15,390 supervisors and 1,539 centre superintendents had been directed to do the needful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:10:26.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
