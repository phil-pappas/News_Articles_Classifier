St James Park manager Steve McClaren is already without his second choice Karl Darlow because of a foot injury. \nTheir other senior keeper, Rob Elliot, has been away on international duty as well, and was listed as a substitute for Republic of Ireland's game against Poland in Warsaw. \nNewcastle are bottom of the table after failing to win any of their first eight games in the top flight this term. Losing Krul - a consistent performer for them in recent years having made 184 appearances for the club - is a major setback for them. \nHe tweeted after the game in Astana: \"Gutted to come off with an injury tonight. Thanks for all the get well wishes. I will know more about the extent of the injury after scans.\" \nNow Krul has received the worst news possible, with a statement on Newcastle's website confirming he faces several months on the sidelines. \nIt said: \"Tim Krul has been ruled out for the rest of the 2015/16 Premier League season with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. \n\"The Dutch international had to be withdrawn after 81 minutes of the Netherlands' European Championships qualification match at Kazakhstan's Astana Arena on Saturday evening. \n\"Scans have since determined the severity of the injury. Krul will now return to Tyneside for further treatment and rehabilitation. \n\"Everyone at the club wishes him a speedy recovery. Following Krul's injury, Freddie Woodman has been recalled from his loan spell at Crawley Town.\" \nKrul has vowed to start rehabilitating straight away and spoken of his disappointment at not being able to help Newcastle in their bid to retain their place among England's elite. \nHe said: \"I'm devastated the scan has confirmed my biggest fear, that I have torn my knee cruciate playing for Holland in the game against Kazakhstan last night. \n\"My recovery and hard work starts now to fully recover. I'm devastated I can't play a part on the pitch to help the team turn this season around. I still believe this club can - and should - be up there with the top teams.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:08:59.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
