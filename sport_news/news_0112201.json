It may have been the turning point of his season. \nThe St. Joseph junior linebacker, a serious Division I prospect, got into a little on-field wrestling match with a Don Bosco player at the end of a play late in the game and was ejected. \nThat meant Acceus had to sit out the next game against St. Edward of Ohio, one of the biggest games on the Green Knights’ schedule. \n\"That was my fault,\" Acceus said before Thursday’s practice at Dinallo Stadium. \"That’s a level I never want to go back to. I never should’ve gotten angry. It showed I was selfish and wasn’t thinking about the team.\" \n\"That was completely out of character,\" St. Joseph coach Augie Hoffmann said. \"He just got caught up in the moment.\" \nAcceus, who lives in Spring Valley, N.Y., apologized face to face to the coaching staff and then to his teammates. He said the brief moment of anger provided a major dose of maturity, and he – and by extension, the Green Knights – have been reaping the benefits ever since. \nSince returning to the lineup, the 6-foot, 200-pound Acceus has been one of the premier players on one of North Jersey’s best defenses. He has a team-high 53 tackles in six games, including four sacks, and will be a focal point Saturday afternoon when the Green Knights, No. 2 in The Record non-public football Top 6, takes on No. 1 Bergen Catholic in a Big North United Division game. \n\"You can’t coach what he has,\" Hoffmann said. \"He’s mobile. Explosive on contact. \n\"He has exceptional speed. He’s an intense individual. He’s a quiet, ‘Yes, sir. No, sir’ guy, but you can see he has laser focus.\" \nAcceus returned from the one-game suspension with something to prove. He had nine tackles and two sacks in a 20-7 victory over DePaul. He then had 12 tackles in a win over Eastern Christian Academy and 17 in a loss to St. Joseph Prep. \n\"I’ve just been focusing on my responsibilities,\" Acceus said. \"All I’ve been doing is make sure I do my job. I just try to keep any big play from happening.\" \nAcceus already has Division I scholarship offers from Rutgers, Boston College, Miami, Wisconsin and Indiana State. He’s not afraid to admit he’s still a work in progress, and he said the first two months of this season have been a great learning experience. \n\"I usually have low self-confidence,\" Acceus said. \"I felt like I wasn’t a good player. I just didn’t believe in myself. \n\"I’d make a mistake in practice, and I’d get down on myself. But the coaches have embraced me and taught me so much.\" \nAcceus also is learning how to be a leader. \nHe said he’s not very vocal – \"I don’t know how to yell,\" he said with a smile – but his play, coupled with his willingness to take responsibility for his mistakes, has earned respect. \n\"He’s just a good kid,\" Hoffmann said. \nThe St. Joseph offense isn’t quite as explosive as it was last season, and the defense has been the backbone of much of the Green Knights’ success. Acceus said the team learned a lot about itself during its two recent road trips that included a well-played loss to IMG Academy and a rather shocking loss to St. Joseph Prep. \n\"We can’t come out and be lackadaisical,\" Acceus said. \"We have to be ready and come out guns blazing. \n\"We can’t be too relaxed. We can’t be laid back. That’s why I hope we get to go out first on defense Saturday, so we can set the tone.\" \nThe Crusaders are a different team without injured senior quarterback Jarrett Guarantano, but still are dangerous because the offense is now much more unpredictable. Acceus, however, believes the St. Joseph defense is up to the challenge. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:57:23.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
