He has been out since straining the medial collateral ligament in his left knee Sept. 27 in a win at St. Louis. \nBackup quarterback Mike Vick was ruled out. He strained his right hamstring last Sunday in a victory over Arizona and did not practice all week. \nThird-string quarterback Landry Jones replaced Vick in the third quarter, rallied the Steelers to the win, and is the presumptive starter this week for Pittsburgh (4-2). \nSafety Will Allen (ankle) and defensive end Stephon Tuitt (knee) will also sit out Sunday. \nAllen will miss his second straight game and again be replaced by Robert Golden. \nThe injury to Tuitt, hurt in last week's game, is expected to create a shuffle on the defensive line. Nose tackle Steve McLendon is likely to shift to end with backup Daniel McCullers taking over on the nose. Reserve end Cam Thomas is also expected to play more snaps. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:05:59.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
