The 2015 Legislature enacted new laws -- including sick-leave requirements and a new retirement program â€“ that will increase paperwork for many businesses. Other changes, including a higher minimum wage and possible tax increases, loom as possibilities in 2016, via either the Legislature or ballot measures.\nHow do these changes affect small businesses? What can businesses do to implement new laws and regulations as efficiently as possible? What can local governments do to help small businesses? Is the small business climate getting worse or better?\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive's fourth Big Idea forum, Nurturing Small Business , will explore these and other questions at 6:30 Wednesday at the University of Oregon's George S. Turnbull Portland Center, 70 NW Couch Street. You can register for the event at this website.\nPanel members are Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose; Beaverton Mayor Denny Doyle; Charles Funches, loan portfolio manager for Micro Enterprise Services of Oregon; Franz Spielvogel, chief executive officer of Laughing Planet; and David Chown of Chown Hardware. The event will be moderated by Erik Lukens and Mark Hester of The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board.", "external_links": ["http://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-big-idea-nurturing-small-business-tickets-19050952913?aff=BoardShare"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:21:57.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
