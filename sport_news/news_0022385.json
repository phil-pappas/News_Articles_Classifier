Our partnership with the Rockford Park District allows us to play our games here,\" says Rockford Hockey Club president Ron Hart. \"The off-ice center here is part of their development. It makes them better. Most of the rinks don't have this so it's a great opportunity for hockey and youth hockey in this area.\" Can't Find Something? 10322 Auburn Road, Rockford, IL 61103 Switchboard: 815-335-2213", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:25:13.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
