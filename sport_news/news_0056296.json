Some thought it was an elk. One called it an oryx, a type of striking-looking antelope native to Africa.\nSteve Clark quickly provided The Oregonian/OregonLive with photographs of the animal that he took in the Northwest Portland park. It's definitely an oryx!\nThe oryx, it turns out, belongs to Reed Gleason, a Skyline Boulvevard resident who has raised a small herd of oryx over the past two decades. He spent hours looking for his missing oryx Saturday before finding it unharmed -- and confronting the dilemma of how to get it home.\nEverything about Oryx What are they? They are antelope and live in desert-like environments. There are four species, and the Forest Park oryx is clearly a scimitar-horned oryx. How common are they? They are rare â€“ and not just in Portland. Scimitar-horned oryx are believed to be extinct in the wild, although one large semi-wild population is being raised to be set free in Tunisia. Hunters who like its exotic long horns are to blame. How big are they? They stand about 3 feet high at the shoulder, and the slightly curved horns can add another 3 feet. Males weigh from 300 to 450 pounds, and females 200 to 300 pounds. How do they behave? They are very sociable and like to live and travel in herds, which is bad news for our lonely orxy in Forest Park. They can tolerate extremely high temperatures and can go for as long as nine months without water. They try to stay away from their primary predators: lions, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, golden jackals What do they eat? They eat a healthy high-fiber vegetarian diet: foliage, grass, herbs, shrubs, succulents, legumes, buds and fruit. Sources: Smithsonian Institution, Wikipedia, University of Michigan Clark provided pretty persuasive evidence that the wandering animal is specifically a scimitar-horned oryx, which are extinct in the wild.\nAngie Neff, Clark's wife, reported that the animal seems to trust people and is probably owned by a local family. Oregon Zoo officials told the couple that it is not missing an oryx, she said.\nForest Park is known to be home to deer, coyote, porcupine , bobcats, mountain beaver and all manner of birds. Portland authors Colin Meloy and Carson Ellis have offered some more fanciful suggestions .\nBut there was clearly something out of the ordinary on Germantown Road on Saturday morning, dispatchers said. They don't usually get a single early-morning call reporting large animal sightings in that area.\n\"We got many calls on that animal today,\" a dispatcher told The Oregonian/OregonLive.\nLarge, unusual and with horns were the common descriptors, she said. Most other observations varied. \"Some described the horns as curvy. Some straight.\"\nOne caller reported that he was able to shoo the animal off the road and onto a trail, the dispatcher said.\nFor a time Saturday, Gleason erroneously believed that not one, but two of his oryx, were loose in Forest Park. A second head count of the herd determined only one was missing.\nGleason is known for his devotion to oryx. He has posted adorable videos to YouTube, including this one:\nBack in 2009, Willamette Week wrote about another of Gleason's oryx getting loose into Forest Park. The animal scared some hikers. But that story had a happy ending when Nosy got home on his own in time for his grain dinner.\nThis being Portland, naturally this happened:\n@PDXoryx -- Betsy Hammond\nbetsyhammond@oregonian.com", "external_links": ["http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-10901-more_bite_than_a_great_white_shark.html", "http://www.wildwoodchronicles.com/authors", "http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/PhotoGallery/AfricanSavanna/2.cfm", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ys9ZTdmM-2E"], "published": "2015-10-24T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:18:44.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
