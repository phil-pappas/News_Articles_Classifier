(Kenneth K. Lam / Baltimore Sun) Edward Lee Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Johns Hopkins football still unbeaten, but Jim Margraff not entirely happy after 34-7 rout of Dickinson. \nJohns Hopkins raced to a 34-0 advantage over Centennial Conference rival Dickinson on Friday night – a run capped by junior wide receiver Bradley Munday taking a swing pass from junior quarterback Jonathan Germano and sprinting 72 yards to the end zone just 21 seconds into the third quarter. \nThe Blue Jays, who improved to 6-0 overall and 5-0 in the league and moved to No. 10 in the latest D3football.com poll, cruised to a 34-7 win, but coach Jim Margraff still picked out a few details to rehash. \nMargraff was not entirely happy that the offense sputtered and did not score another point in the final 29:39 of the contest. \n“The first play of the second half, Brad Munday took a swing pass 72 yards for a touchdown, which put us up 34-0, and I thought we lost focus a little bit at that point,” Margraff said Wednesday morning. “I thought our defense played well the entire game, and I thought the offense lost a little bit of focus after a 34-0 lead. They continue to play well. I just thought we lost a little bit of steam at that point.” \nThen again, Margraff said he understood why the players may have taken the foot off the accelerator in the second half against the Red Devils (2-4, 2-3). \n“If you lose a little focus when you’re up by a lot, that’s understandable,” he said. “You still want to work on it, but I’d much rather come out the way we’ve been, and that’s to come out focused and playing hard and playing well. Hopefully, we continue that this week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:17:25.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
