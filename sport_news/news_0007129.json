Shout out 2 @CoachAvery6 4 visiting me @ShepherdCenter 2day during lunch. Awesome guy & a Jaguar 4 life! Thx! #gettingitin #physicaltherapy — Devon J. Gales (@IAmDevonGales) October 14, 2015 \nJohnson — who played basketball at Southern from 1986-88 — was in town for a recruiting trip. \nKnowing he would be in the area, Johnson called Southern athletic director Roman Banks to ask if he could visit Gales. \n\"I don't want to get emotional. I think he did more for me than I did for him,\" Johnson said following Alabama's open practice Thursday night . \"His attitude was so great. He's making progress in his rehab. His mom and his entire family was there. And I'm glad he lifted my spirits about life. He thought I lifted his spirits. He's got a long road ahead. But every day, he's gaining a yard, he's gaining a yard. And I believe one day he's gonna walk again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:11:52.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
