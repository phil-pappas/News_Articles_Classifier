Along with the thick clouds, isolated light showers are trying to fall in western KELOLAND. Anything that is hitting the ground in western KELOLAND is very light. The isolated showers will move into central South Dakota later this afternoon, but anything that hits the ground will remain less than a tenth of an inch. Eastern KELOLAND will have a little bit of sunshine this morning, but clouds will soon take over for the afternoon. Highs this afternoon will range from near 60 in southeast South Dakota to the middle 40s in western South Dakota. \nIsolated showers will be possible tonight as temperatures fall to the 30s and 40s. We’ll continue to run our light shower chances through midweek, but the amounts of rain will stay less than a tenth of an inch in eastern KELOLAND. Amounts may approach a quarter inch today through Wednesday in Rapid City. Wednesday will be much cooler with highs in the 40s. \nTemperatures will slowly warm for the weekend with highs returning to the 50s for Saturday and Sunday. There is a slight chance for showers on Saturday, but don’t let that chance cancel any Halloween plans you may have. The showers will remain light and widely scattered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:59:51.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
