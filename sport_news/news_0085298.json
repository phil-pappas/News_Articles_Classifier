The Jays turned around 2-0 deficit with three straight victories to win the best-of-five set.\n\nMembers of the Kansas City Royals celebrate their 14-2 win against the Toronto Blue Jays during Game 4 of baseball's American League Championship Series on Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015, in Toronto.

You know you've still got a lot of work ahead of you.\"\nToronto manager John Gibbons said his team's performance against Texas in the ALDS gives them an added confidence boost.\n\"They've done it before,\" he said. \"It definitely wasn't easy. But we proved to ourselves we could do it. But it will be a battle.\"\nKansas City, which finished the regular season with an American League-best 95-67 record, has history on its side.\nOf the last 79 teams to have a 3-1 lead in an LCS, 67 of them have advanced to the World Series, with 39 winning the league pennant in five games.\nOne of those 12 teams to claw back from a 3-1 hole, however, was the 1985 Royals, who rattled off three straight wins to claim the ALCS from the Blue Jays in seven games.\nThis Kansas City team is used to playing on big stages after winning the AL pennant and advancing to the World Series last year.\nYost says that experience will help his team going forward.\n\"You know, last year there was a lot of excitement,\" Yost said. \"We hadn't been through it. This year we do have that experience. We've been through it. We understand what it's like.\n\"I think we're more comfortable in this environment now. So just makes it a little bit easier.\"\nCatcher Salvador Perez, who's 2 for 15 with a home run, a walk, an RBI and three runs scores during this ALCS, agreed with his manager.\n\"I think the experience is important for us,\" Perez said. \"Last year we just wanted to be in playoff because we've never been before.\n\"Now we know how it feels, and now we want to win.\"\n___\nFollow @throwinsmoke on Twitter\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:00:53.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
