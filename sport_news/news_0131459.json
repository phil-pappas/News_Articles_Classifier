They need to beat the Czech Republic and hope Turkey, two points ahead of the Dutch, do not beat group leaders Iceland, if they are to make the play-offs.\nWith the injury ruling him out for rest of the season, Newcastle United's Krul said he was \"devastated\" he will not be able to help the Magpies turn their campaign around as the club find themselves glued to the bottom of the Premier League table.\n\"I'm devastated the scan has confirmed my biggest fear, that I have torn my knee cruciate playing for Holland in the game against Kazakhstan last night,\" Krul told the club's website (www.nufc.co.uk).\n\"My recovery and hard work starts now to fully recover.\n\"I'm devastated I can't play a part on the pitch to help the team turn this season around. I still believe this Club can, and should, be up there with the top teams,\" he added.\n(For .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:33:24.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
