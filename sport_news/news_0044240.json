He also dusted off getting plunked by Pittsburgh reliever Tony Watson to send the Cubs to the NL Division Series in St. Louis starting on Friday. \nDexter Fowler homered and scored three times for the Cubs. Kyle Schwarber added a towering two-run shot off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole as Chicago raced to an early lead and let Arrieta do the rest. \nThe largest crowd ever at PNC Park failed to rattle Arrieta or one of baseball's youngest teams. Manager Joe Maddon's club played with swagger and confidence and looked right at home while snapping a nine-game playoff losing streak that dated to the 2003 NL Championship Series. \nRANGERS-BLACKHAWKS \nRangers hold on for 3-2 victory over Blackhawks \nCHICAGO (AP) - Oscar Lindberg, Kevin Klein and Derek Stepan scored in the first period, and the New York Rangers ruined Chicago's Stanley Cup party with a 3-2 victory over the Blackhawks on Wednesday on the first night of the NHL season. \nJ.T. Miller had two assists and Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves for New York. \nCheered on by a sellout crowd of 22,104, with many dressed in their usual red jerseys, the Blackhawks raised the banner for the franchise's sixth NHL title during a colorful pregame ceremony. Fluorescent balls bounced around the seats and LED wristbands for the fans provided a synchronized lightshow during player introductions and highlight presentations. \nAll-Star winger Patrick Kane, the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York, heard loud cheers when he skated onto the ice for the Cup celebration. Kane has not been charged. \nArtemi Panarin scored in his first NHL game for Chicago, which is trying to become the first team to defend the title since the Red Wings in 1997-98. Teuvo Teravainen also scored, and Corey Crawford made 24 stops. \nBLUES-GOMEZ \nBlues sign Scott Gomez to 1-year contract \nST. LOUIS (AP) - The St. Louis Blues signed forward Scott Gomez to a one-year contract Wednesday. \nThe 35-year-old Gomez, a 15-year NHL veteran, attended training camp on a professional tryout. He had seven goals and 27 assists in 58 games last season for New Jersey. \nSt. Louis added forward Scottie Upshall on Monday, also after a tryout. \nThe Blues placed forward Patrik Berglund on long-term injured reserve. Berglund underwent shoulder surgery in August and will be evaluated in four months. \nSt. Louis said defenseman Alex Pietrangelo and forward Alexander Steen will be assistant captains. \nNLDS-CARDINALS-ROTATION \nBesides Lackey in Game 1, Matheny mum on rotation \nST. LOUIS (AP) - John Lackey gets the start in Game 1 of the NL Division Series for the St. Louis Cardinals on Friday. \nAt the beginning of a two-hour workout for the NL Central champions on Tuesday, manager Mike Matheny said he was not ready to announce the rest of his playoff rotation or his roster. Matheny said he will likely reveal the roster after a workout Thursday. \nThe 36-year-old Lackey went 9-4 with a 1.93 ERA in 17 starts at home. Overall, he was 13-10 with a 2.77 ERA - the first sub 3.00 ERA of his big career. \nMatheny has Jaime Garcia (10-6, 2.43), Lance Lynn (12-11, 3.03) and Michael Wacha (17-7, 3.38) for Games 2, 3 and 4, in some order. Wacha could be pushed back after going 2-3 with a 7.88 ERA in five September starts. \nUS-ITALY \nUS women's team beats Italy 79-66 \nROME (AP) - Atlanta Dream star Angel McCoughtry scored 19 points to help the U.S. women's team beat Italy 79-66 on Wednesday night in the second game of the Americans' European tour. \nPhoenix's Candice Dupree had 15 points and six rebounds, Chicago's Elena Delle Donne and Phoenix's Brittney Griner added 13 points each, and Los Angeles' Candace Parker had 10 points and 12 rebounds. Chiara Consolini led Italy with 16 points. \n\"There were stretches of the game where we really played well, and there were stretches of the game where we let them do a lot of things that hurt us,\" said coach Geno Auriemma of the Univesity of Connecticut. \"But I think that's why we're here. We want to know a little more about our players. So, whenever you're pushed a little bit like we were today, that's a good thing.\" \nSince being selected to coach the team in 2009, Auriemma has directed the squad to a 24-0 record and gold medals in the 2012 Olympics and 2010 and 2014 world championships. \nThe Americans opened Sunday night in Spain with a 94-52 victory over Spanish League champion Uni Girona. They will face Dike Naples on Thursday night, and finish the tour Friday night at EuroLeague champion USK Prague. \nOBIT-GALLATIN \nHall of Fame basketball player Harry Gallatin dies \nEDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (AP) - Harry Gallatin, the Hall of Fame basketball player who was a seven-time All-Star forward for the New York Knicks in the 1950s, died Wednesday.

He then coached in the NBA, going 111-82 in 2 1/2 seasons with the St. Louis Hawks and 25-38 in parts of two seasons with the Knicks. \nGallatin served as Southern Illinois-Edwardsville's athletic director from 1967 to 1972.
