In addition, Honor Code, a major contender for the Classic, will prep in a one turn mile, the Grade 2 Kelso Handicap, on the Gold Cup undercard.\nIt appears that American Pharoah will go straight from last month’s loss in the Travers at Saratoga directly to the Classic. Without a prep race in between, the lengthy nine-week gap should give him plenty of rest before his attempt at racing’s first grand slam. Last weekend, West Coast contender Beholder, a 5-year-old mare and probably chief challenger to the Triple Crown winner, won easily in the Zenyatta Stakes on Santa Anita’s opening weekend.\nThe Classic will be held on Oct. 31 at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Ky., for the first time in the event’s 31-year history. The richest race in North America with a purse of $5 million will culminate a racing season that produced the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years in American Pharoah. The Classic will be the last scheduled race of his career as he will go to stud at Coolmore Ashford Stud in Kentucky after the race.\nThe Classic, run at a mile-and-a-quarter, should draw a quality field including several from this weekend’s races at Belmont. The Jockey Club Gold Cup, run at the same distance as the Classic, always attracts top contenders and this year is no different.\nLast year’s winner Tonalist (6-5) was instilled as the morning line favorite by oddsmaker Eric Donovan. He will look to repeat his winning effort at Big Sandy against a much smaller field than he faced last year. Tonalist will have Hall of Fame jockey John Velazquez aboard and drew the outside post No. 6.\n“Six out of six is good,” trainer Christophe Clement said of the draw. “Basically, that way Johnny can do whatever he wants. It’ll be more up to Johnny than to me but I think it’s OK. It’ll be up to Johnny to do what he wants.”\nTonalist has only posted one win in his four starts this year, but he has suffered from some poor rides and was in contention in each of the four races. He should be a major contender Saturday afternoon against the small, but quality field. He’s also looking to atone for his abysmal performance in last year’s Classic at Santa Anita where he just didn’t take to the speed favoring track.\nOddly, the race has only four trainers looking to make their way to the winner’s circle, as both Jimmy Jerkens and Todd Pletcher entered two horses each. Jerkens will have Wicked Strong and Effinex in the gate and Pletcher sends out Constitution and Coach Inge to challenge the heavy favorite.\nWicked Strong (6-1), who lost rider Rajiv Maragh in a horrific fall in last year’s Gold Cup, returns looking for his first major win of the racing season. Last year’s Travers runner-up comes out of a third-place finish in the Woodward at Saratoga.\nEffinex (6-1) has had a roller-coaster year, but has two wins at the distance and could be a factor if he doesn’t bolt like he did in the Grade 2 Brooklyn on the Belmont Stakes undercard.\n“He’s won at it twice so that’s got to mean something,” Jerkens said of the distance. “He’s kind of hard to figure out. I don’t why he did what he did the day he bolted and I don’t know why he acted the way he did in the gate. He keeps us guessing, but when he gets in that gate with the right frame of mind, he’s as good as any of them, that’s for sure.”\nThe Jockey Club Gold Cup is one of the few races on the NYRA circuit that Pletcher has never won. His two charges will both be competitive in the race. Constitution (3-1), who won the Grade 1 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream earlier in the year, attracted hot jockey Javier Castellano to ride. Coach Inge (5-1) comes off a strong second-place finish in the Woodward after winning the aforementioned Brooklyn at 1½ miles.\nJCGC Outlook: 1 – Tonalist; 2 – Constitution; 3 – Coach Inge; and 4 - Effinex\nHonor Code’s connections decided to skip the Gold Cup and focus on the Kelso, a one-mile race, as a tune up for the Classic. In many racing circles he’s being mentioned with the top two Classic contenders as one of the top horses to bring home the prize in Lexington. A strong effort Saturday afternoon against a field of seven will catapult him into single digit odds in Kentucky.\nHonor Code will try to add the Kelso to his Met Mile win at Belmont on Belmont Stakes Day and look to win his fifth race in his last six tries.\nTop contenders include Red Vine, who comes out of the Pacific Classic after finishing third behind Beholder and Mylute, who will be one of two entrants for Pletcher in the Kelso.\nJerkens didn’t discount trainer Shug McGaughey’s decision for Honor Code to skip the Gold Cup for the Kelso discussing the decision on a national media teleconference Tuesday.\n“I think he thinks he’ll stay fresher just running the mile, and just hoping that he gets a good fast pace to run at in the Classic. I think it’s a good move on Shug’s part to do that. You know, like you say, the rest of us aside of the big three we’re just trying to earn our spot and see if we can get lucky and maybe get a piece of it.”\nGene Kershner, a Buffalo-based turf writer, is a member of the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters Association, and tweets @EquiSpace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:43:33.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
