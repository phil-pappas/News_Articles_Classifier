It's a crazy feeling,\" Paulsboro quarterback Carlton Aiken said of taking part in the storied matchup. \nAiken shined as his Red Raiders cruised to a road win in a game that - as usual - will also go a long way toward deciding the Colonial Conference Patriot Division. \n\"Winning this game, especially the 100th, is just a great feeling,\" said Aiken, who completed 17 of 24 passes for 254 yards and a touchdown. \nPaulsboro running back Dehron Holloway walked with a slight limp after the game. \nHolloway is just a sophomore, standing 5-foot-7 and weighing just 160 pounds. But he spent the afternoon not just juking, but running over and through defenders. \nHe finished with 72 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries. His final carry was a two-yard touchdown - his South Jersey-leading 18th -that put the Red Raiders ahead by 35-6 in the fourth quarter. \n\"My knee popped in and out a little bit on that play,\" he said. \"But I'm all right. It was just a tough game, hard fought.\" \nHolloway gave the type of gritty, throwback performance that could make fans of any generation proud, something he was aware of throughout the game. \n\"We're only six miles away from each other, this is a big rivalry,\" Holloway said. \"We had to come out here and play our hearts out.\" \nAfter a game that was never really in question, Paulsboro (5-1, 4-0) leads the series, 52-43-3. The rivalry began in 1915, and the teams played just five times before 1933. They've played every season since then. \n\"Paulsboro came to play today, we just didn't come up big when we had to,\" said Woodbury coach Al Mailahn, whose team fell to 3-3 and 2-1 in the division. \"But it's awesome . \n\"It's just always been such a big thing in both of these communities that are so close together.\" \nPaulsboro 6 15 7 7 - 35 \nWoodbury 0 0 6 0 - 6 \nP: Emmanuel Simon 17 pass from Carlton Aiken (kick failed) \nP: Dehron Holloway 7 run (John Pellegrini pass from Aiken) \nP: Aiken 1 run (Matt Calce kick) \nW: Darius Triplett 1 run (kick failed) \nP: Holloway 9 run (Calce kick) \nP: Holloway 1 run (Calce kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:10:30.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
