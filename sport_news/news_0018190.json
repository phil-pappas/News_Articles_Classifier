The 2016 regulations also specify that only one specification can be used during the season. \nHowever, Thursday's meeting provisionally agreed that development will indeed be allowed during 2016, as it was this year. This will be a huge boost for both Honda and Renault, as they attempt to close the gap on their rivals. \nIn addition, the possibility of using year-old engines is back on the table, after Manor Marussia was given dispensation this season to use the 2014 Ferrari unit. This will potentially open a door for both Infiniti Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso. \nOnly members of the FIA and representatives of the four engine manufacturers, with Toto Wolff (Mercedes), Maurizio Arrivabene (Ferrari), Cyril Abiteboul (Renault) and Yasuhisa Arai (Honda) joined by their top engineers. The other teams were not present. \nAs the proposals require rule changes for next season, they still have to go through the process of being formally drafted and unanimously agreed by all the teams at the F1 Commission. It then has to be ratified by the World Motor Sport Council. At the moment, no date has been set for the next F1 Commission meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:23:44.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
