We need to be organised in our possession otherwise they will counter us really quickly and we'll find ourselves in the game. \n\"West Ham have a bigger and stronger squad than us. But if we can stay clear of injuries and keep this group together, we can compete with them and that's what we've got to hope to do.\" \nWhile City, Arsenal and Manchester United occupy the top three spots, Pardew and his players can lay claim to the current best-of-the-rest tag - as the Englishman prepares to host another in-form side. \n\"It is a top-of-the-table encounter,\" he added. \n\"That is good for two teams who weren't predicted to be there at this stage of the season. We're coming off a good performance and West Ham will be aware of that. I am sure they will be looking to upset our rhythm and what we do really well.\" \nGoing into the international break in good form it would be usual for Pardew to be disappointed to have lost a number of players to their respective nations. \nBut this time the gap between club fixtures has helped the Eagles get a number of players off their injury list and back into contention for the London derby. \n\"It's good news for us,\" Pardew said of his available squad. \n\"Damian Delaney is back training, Mile Jedinak is back training, Jordon Mutch is back training and so is Chungy (Lee Chung-yong. The only ones missing for this weekend are Connor Wickham, Marouane Chamakh and Joel Ward.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:12:59.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
