India rode on Kohli’s brilliant 138 to post 299/8 and then restricted the visitors to 264/9, despite a valiant ton by rival skipper AB de Villiers, to win by 35 runs. “It is one of my more challenging innings in ODI cricket, especially because of the attack they have,” said Kohli. “Besides, the pitch wasn’t quick enough to get boundaries. So I had to run a lot, keep pushing the boundary fielders and keep looking for gaps. Probably that’s why I started cramping in the end. In the afternoon it gets pretty tough in Chennai and the conditions to bat are pretty difficult. But right now I feel great about it,” he said. His knock included 66 singles and nine doubles. Kohli said he knew he would have to push himself hard given the conditions. “Till about 70 or 75, I had hit only three boundaries and a couple of sixes. The effort was to keep rotating the strike and keep getting those doubles as well,” he explained. But in the end, said Kohli, the physical exhaustion was worth every bit as India won the match. “It feels really special to get a big hundred, especially as we were 1-2 down in the series. It was something that needed to be done while batting at No. 3 again. I knew that this pitch was probably a 260-270 pitch but I pushed myself after I got my hundred,” Kohli said. “I was getting cramps but I thought if I could get 30 or 35 more runs here, the team will probably get to 300. That was the whole point of pushing myself and it feels absolutely wonderful that we are 2-2 now.” — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:11:58.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
