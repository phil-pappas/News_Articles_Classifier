The Vikings must now forfeit their victories over Lebanon and Pine Grove due to the use of an ineligible player. (Jeremy Long â€” GameTimePA.com) \nThe Northern Lebanon football team has forfeited its first two contests of the season for having used an ineligible player, the PIAA District 3 Committee announced Tuesday. The previously undefeated Vikings now sit at 5-2 and 19th in the newly adjusted District 3 power rankings with victories over Pine Grove and Lebanon converted to losses. The top 16 teams in the power rankings make the District 3 tournament. \nNorthern Lebanon defeated Pine Grove in its opener, 52-0, and beat Lebanon 51-27 on the road in Week 2. \nThe school's administration self-reported the ineligibility issue, which violated a PIAA by-law from Article XIII, Section 1, Sub-section A stating: \nTo remedy any possible harm to opponents from participation by an ineligible student or Coach, and to remove any incentive for such participation, a school is required to forfeit all Contests in which an ineligible student participated and/or an ineligible Coach coached on behalf of the school, regardless of whether the ineligibility was known at the time of participation and/or Coaching or discovered later. \nAn opposing coach on Northern Lebanon's schedule this season reacted to the news Tuesday. \n\"In the end, the losses aren't the worst part. I feel bad that this young man wasn't given the proper guidance upon entering the school,\" the opposing coach said. \"Somewhere in the chain of command, either through lack of knowledge or intentional neglect, this was missed. Advertisement \n\"We actually had the same thing this year, and my AD told us the student was ineligible for 15 days. I never had to deal with it. We were able to take care of it from the beginning, the right way for the kid and the team.\" \nMore to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:19:10.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
