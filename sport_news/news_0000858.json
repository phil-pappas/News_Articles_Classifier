(Photo: FILE) 2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThree weeks before the men's basketball season begins, Furman has already suffered some injuries \nThe Paladins held their annual purple and white scrimmage Saturday with All-SoCon guard Stephen Croone, sophomore point guard John Davis and freshman forward Jalen Williams watching from the sidelines. \nCroone, who's the leading returning scorer in the Southern Conference with an average of 17.3 points per game last season, has a torn ligament in his left thumb. He will have surgery Monday and is expected to miss 4-8 weeks. \n\"It stinks for the kid, but he will be back,\" head coach Niko Medved said. \"We will know more after he has surgery.\" \nWilliams, out of Wade Hampton High, suffered what doctors described to Medved as a \"mini-stroke.\" Medved said Williams will not participate in any activity for a couple of weeks and will definitely redshirt this season. The ailment is similar to what happened to Williams' freshman teammate Andrew Brown when Brown was at Travelers Rest High. \n\"Jalen just had a really unfortunate situation,\" Medved said. \"The doctors anticipate it's not going to be a long-term problem for him.\" \nDavis is out indefinitely after suffering a concussion a couple of weeks ago. He still hasn't passed the necessary tests to return. \nWith Croone and Davis out, Medved said sophomore forward Daniel Fowler has been playing point guard in practice, along with freshman Jonathan Jean. \n\"Clearly, it's changed the way we practice without the two kids that played point guard for us last year,\" Medved said. \"It's just an opportunity for other guys to get better and expand their role.\" \nMedved said Saturday's scrimmage was \"good for about a game-and-a-half.\" With a no subs, Medved said players got a little fatigued late \n\"It got a little bit sloppy, but I thought overall it was pretty good and productive,\" Medved said. \"I thought we had a pretty good turnout today. It was really neat to see our fans come out and check us out.\" 2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1S2TmTj TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:19:24.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
