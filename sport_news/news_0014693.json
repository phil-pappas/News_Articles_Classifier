Senior Joe Takacs found himself in the path of the shot with his back to goal, and flicked the ball past a diving Parker Shade to put his team ahead after 2:30 of play. \n“I just hit it, hoping it would go somewhere, and Joe somehow got on the end of it and put it in,” Long said. \n“I do it a lot in practice,” Takacs said of the flick. “It paid off during a game.” \nTwelve minutes later, Takacs headed down a Phillipsburg corner, resulting in a Vernon handball in the box. Keegan Halloran stepped up and smoothly finished the ensuing penalty kick. \n“It definitely motivated our whole team,” Takacs said of the fast start. “It made us want to defend and win this game. And we did.” \nThe Stateliners dominated the run of play after jumping ahead, bossing the ball at midfield and creating several opportunities. \n“We wanted to make sure that we defended as a group, played hard, played tough, won the 50/50s and (took) our opportunities when we created them,” Phillipsburg coach Evan Weller said. “We did that today.” \nStill, for all the chances that came Phillipsburg’s way, including a long-range effort by Long that hit the crossbar, it couldn’t come up with the blow that knocked Vernon (10-4-1) out for good. \nThat made for nervous moments when William Schiesswohl, who blasted the corner of the goal frame with a free kick earlier, ripped a shot into the side netting to pull Vernon to 2-1 with 3:14 remaining in the second half. \n“I feel like we feel asleep after we hadn’t scored in a while,” Long said. “We kind of just started playing lazy and sitting behind the ball.” \nThe Stateliners ushered out the remainder of the game without incident, however, and are on track in the county bracket after a runner-up finish in 2014. \n“We were banging on the door there,” Weller said about getting a third goal. “It would have been nice to get that one. However, even without it, the kids worked hard and did what needed to be done.” \nP’burg hasn’t won a county crown since 1989. \n“We certainly believe in ourselves,” Weller said. “We believe we’re capable of doing some great things. … We’re going to practice all week to get mentally prepared and we’re going to go up to Newton next Saturday and try our chances against a good team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:55:43.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
