Villar is president of Spain's soccer federation and a vice president of FIFA and UEFA, which governs European soccer.\nBlatter is accused of making a \"disloyal payment\" to Platini in 2011, as well as negotiating an unfavorable television contract involving former vice president Jack Warner. Valcke has been accused of misusing expenses and other infringements of regulations. All three deny any wrongdoing and have appealed .\nThose sanctions can be extended by up to 45 days, which effectively ends Blatter's reign over world soccer — with the FIFA congress to replace him scheduled for Feb. 26.\nThe Ethics Committee said Wednesday it was continuing to investigate the allegations against the three men and will do everything possible to reach a speedy resolution.\nA FIFA statement read: \"The investigatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee has confirmed that proceedings are ongoing against FIFA President Joseph Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini, both of whom are currently provisionally suspended. The investigation is focusing on a payment of CHF 2 million from FIFA to Michel Platini in February 2011.\n\"The investigatory chamber will do everything in its power to ensure that a decision can be taken by the adjudicatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, chaired by Hans-Joachim Eckert, within the 90-day suspension period (which began on 8 October 2015) of the two football officials.\n\"The investigatory chamber also confirms the ongoing proceedings against suspended FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke related to the suspicion of misuse of expenses and other infringements of FIFA's rules and regulations.\"\nThe FBI and the attorney general of Switzerland are also conducting investigations.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer-news/4657684-sepp-blatter-fifa-suspension-michel-platini-jerome-valcke", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer-news/4657555-blatter-and-platini-banned-by-fifa-ethiccommittee", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4653134-david-beckham-england-mnchester-united-photos", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4612418-classic-memorable-photos-of-pele-brasil-cosmos-soccer-world-cup", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:08:29.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
