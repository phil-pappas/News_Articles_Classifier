Raise your hand if this what you expected to see on Thursday Night Football this week. \nAnyone? Anyone? Beuller? Can a healthy Wagner help stop the bleeding? \nI didn’t think so. It’s gone a bit sideways for the Seahawks the last two games, blowing two score, 4 th quarter leads in each of the past two games. They’ve played well enough to win the games in both cases, just not in the 4 th quarter where mistakes on defense and a lack of production on offense continue to plague them. \nOn paper, the Niners and the Seahawks look like a prime time TV scheduling flop right now. Don’t discount what might happen in this game, however. This is a division rivalry game between two teams that quite frankly, don’t like each other and nerves are frazzled on both ends making fights and shoving matches highly likely. \nThe Seahawks badly need a victory if they hope to still somehow wind up with a playoff spot. Here’s what I’ll be watching for in this one. Finishing \nWe’ve all heard it repeatedly in 2015 about the Seahawks. They can’t finish a game. They’ve had a lead in the 4 th quarter in every game this season but have four losses. \nIt’s easy to point a finger at the defense for not hanging on to those leads but that’s not 100% accurate or fair. The offense has gone to sleep in the 4 th quarter this season. They have to continue to score a few points in the last quarter of these games while resting the defense and taking time off the clock. Sherman and LOB need to listen to each other a little bit better to avoid miscues. \nThe above statement is by no means an endorsement of the great play of the Seahawks defense. They too have been bad and share the blame for the losses. Two major things are killing the Seahawks defense. #1. They can’t cover a tight end. I personally believe this to be a communication problem but tight ends scoring touchdowns against the Seahawks are getting really old. Figure it out gentleman. Get on the same page and cover that guy. The Seahawks defenders certainly have the ability. #2. The Seahawks can’t stop the run. The defense is allowing an average of 100 yards per game on the ground. That’s 16 th in the NFL . By comparison they were 20 yards better and 3 rd overall in this category last year. A healthy Bobby Wagner will help in this area but they haven’t been good even when he has played. The O-Line \nFor two weeks now, the offensive line has been a bit better. In the Panthers game, Tom Cable went with Patrick Lewis at center over Drew Nowak . Lewis responded and played pretty well. \nThe bad news here is that Lewis wound up injured and will not be available Thursday. Nowak figures to get the starts again until Lewis is healthy. The Seahawks have re-acquired Lemeul Jean-Pierre to serve as a backup center. Special Teams \nGranted he hasn’t had many chances since a hot start but I think it’s time that the Seahawks find a way to get rookie Tyler Lockett some chances on special teams. Lockett has previously returned a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns on the season. It certainly wouldn’t hurt to come up with some trickery to try and make that happen again. Wilson and the offense need to think 7, not 3. Turnovers \nThe Seahawks defense did a very good job taking the ball away last week. Two interceptions of Cam Newton, and nearly a third, netted the Seahawks a total of just six points, however. \nRussell Wilson has to take advantage of these situations. Settling for three points is something the Seahawks have done far too many times in this year. In fact, the Seahawks are dead LAST in the NFL in red zone TD percentage at 28%. \nWhen the Hawks are in the red zone or have a short field thanks to a turnover, they need to score seven points. Stay Out Of The Press \nThe Seahawks have had their names in the press the past couple of weeks for a couple of reasons other than for what they have done, or not done, on the field. \nWe have Derrick Coleman leaving the scene of an accident, getting suspended, then getting re-instated. We also have Fred Jackson getting in a wreck that was initially called a drag race with Marshawn Lynch but that part of the story has since been rebuffed. \nIt’s likely that neither of these situations have the Seahawks players that are involved legally at fault for anything criminal at this point. Still, they were there, it happened, it’s on the news and it needs to not happen anymore. All these things serve as a distraction and take away the focus the team needs now, more than ever. Prediction \nIt’s going to be feisty. It’s going to be ugly at times. There’s probably going to be at least a couple of shoving matches but the Seahawks are going to end the losing streak. \nSeahawks take the Niners, 27-17 in this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:39:05.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
