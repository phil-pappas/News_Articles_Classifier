Read Stephen's stuff here. Follow him on Twitter here. \nCavalier Insider: Syracuse played its first four games at home before traveling to South Florida last week and losing by 21 points. Is the 3-2 record more reflective of a favorable early schedule or do you see this team competing for a bowl? \nStephen Bailey: I actually think the game on Saturday will determine whether or not this Syracuse team can compete for a bowl. The offense has shown promise, but not 60 minutes of production yet. The defense has been able to generate pressure, but not consistently enough to avoid giving up the big plays (tackling has also been an issue). With a young team, it's hard to know what to expect, but looking at the back half of the schedule I don't think 3-3 will be good enough to get to six. \nCI: Orange freshman quarterback Eric Dungey returned last week after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit against Central Michigan on Sept. 19. His passing numbers are solid – 660 yards, seven touchdowns, one interception — but he's also second on the team in rushing attempts and third in rushing yards. How much of a threat does he give Syracuse in the option game? \nSB: He's definitely athletic enough to get you 6-8 yards on an option run or take off when receivers are covered to pick up a first down. What impresses me most about Dungey's mobility, though, is his accuracy throwing on the move — especially off play action. If SU can get the running game going, look for Dungey to take shots over the top off play action. \nCI: Almost expectedly, Syracuse's defense gave up 244 yards to LSU running back — and Heisman front-runner — Leonard Fournette on Sept. 26. But then the Orange yielded 282 on the ground to USF last Saturday. How much of a concern is the SU run defense? \nSB: It's a legitimate concern. There are a couple guys on defense (weak-side linebacker Marqez Hodge and corner Corey Winfield come to mind) who have really struggled in the run game. Hodge got fooled on a Fournette touchdown and was one of many who failed to shed blocks quick enough against the Bulls. USF beat SU to the perimeter with speed and solid blocking. I think that's a good recipe to beat this unit. \nCI: What was a main reason behind the Orange hanging with LSU in that 34-24 loss? And what showed up in that game that didn't against USF? \nSB: I think it was a combination of stout play from the Syracuse defense early, a slow start from LSU and some well-executed offensive plays late. To be honest, if the Tigers gave Fournette the ball more early and avoided penalties, I don't think it would have been as close. Still, the Orange definitely got up for the game and turned in a performance that generated some excitement within the fanbase. \nCI: This is Virginia's first football meeting with Syracuse as ACC members. The schools have already foreshadowed what could be a nice basketball rivalry. How is UVa viewed from the Orange fanbase? \nSB: That's a good question. Via my roommate, an SU fan: \"I don't think much of UVa football. They're a beatable ACC team.\" I would say that's probably the general opinion, but it's also fair to say that Central New Yorkers haven't watched a ton of the Cavaliers this season. The 1-4 record certainly masks some talent. Subscription Required An online service is needed to view this article in its entirety.
