''He's always run well at Belmont, and we got what we needed today.''\nEmpire Dreams rallied six wide in the stretch for his fifth win in 17 starts. The winner covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48.35 on a fast track.\nEmpire Dreams paid $9.70, $4.20 and $3.40. Royal Posse returned $4.10 and $3.60 while Full of Mine, a 71-1 shot, showed at $23.\nIn other New York Showcase Day stakes:\n-Get Jets, the even-money favorite, took the $250,000 Sleepy Hollow for 2-year-olds by 1 1/2 lengths over Fish Trappe Road. The colt, trained by Tony Dutrow and ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr., won for the second time in three starts, paying $4.10 to win.\n-Palace earned his 12th career victory in the $150,000 Hudson Handicap for sprinters. The 4-5 favorite paid $3.60 to win for the team of trainer Linda Rice and jockey Cornelio Velasquez. The 6-year-old ran the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:15.68.\n-Rice was back in the winner's circle one race later. La Verdad easily captured the $150,000 Iroquois for filly and mare sprinters by 3 3/4 lengths as the 1-5 favorite. Rice now faces decisions. She pre-entered Palace and La Verdad in next weekend's Breeders' Cup at Keeneland. She has until entry time Monday to determine if either comes back on short rest.\n-Lubash edged Kharafa by head in the $200,000 Mohawk in another meeting of these veterans of state-bred turf races. The 8-year-old Lubash won for the 16th time, avenging a 1 1/4 length defeat to Kharafa in last year's Mohawk. Lubash paid $9.10 to win.\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing Belmont Park   34382/73864   2458/4545   7559/11364  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:38:00.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
