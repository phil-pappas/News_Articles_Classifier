Four male students are in custody for plotting to gun down students and faculty at an upcoming Summerville High School event. The students, while not in possession of any weapons, had detailed the plot in written plans that included a list of specific names, and how to obtain guns, Tuolumne County Sheriff James Mele said. The group further detailed the plan when questioned by detectives. In a press conference Saturday afternoon, the sheriff would not talk about the specific time planned for the shooting, fearing a possible copycat. In addition, the Sheriff’s Office will not contact the parents of students on the list until the ongoing investigation is complete. The four were arrested Friday and turned over to Tuolumne County Probation Department before transfer to a juvenile facility outside the county, as there is not one in Tuolumne County. The students, whose names were not released because they are juveniles, were charged with conspiracy to commit an assault with deadly weapons. The case will be prosecuted by the Tuolumne County District Attorney’s Office. The investigation began Wednesday afternoon when a group of students overheard three of the potential gunmen discussing the plot and notified a teacher who then notified administration. At the press conference Mele and Summerville Union High School District Superintendent Robert Griffith commended the students who notified administration, but said they want to keep their identities unknown at this time. “Their willingness to get involved prevented what well could have been another needless tragedy,” said Mele. The school removed the suspect students from class, searched for weapons, and contacted the Sheriff’s Office shortly after. No weapons were found, and an immediate threat was not identified. The three were immediately removed from campus. Detectives questioned the students and searched their homes. Mele would not elaborate on the evidence found but said electronic devices were among the materials confiscated. The investigation revealed a fourth accomplice, who was removed from campus Friday. When asked about motive Mele said, “I have no idea, but I do know the discussion needs be: How do we stop this violence? Because it's not just gun violence. This is an issue of violence on our campuses.” It is a cultural issue Mele said should be addressed through partnerships between schools, law enforcement and mental health workers. Several parents voiced concern over the school’s ability to protect i’s roughly 650 students and questioned adequate drills and training on campus. Griffith told The Union Democrat after the press conference that an active shooter training for staff is scheduled for Oct. 15. He said he does not know if the school has held the training in the past. The school schedules 10 drills a year, which can be either lockdown or fire drills. Senior Sarah Boyer said she can not remember performing one lockdown drill while at the school. Griffith said he has participated in several lockdown drills during his three years. If students are unaware of the drills that presents another problem, he said. The campus has security personnel, but Griffith would not reveal how many or how often they patrol, for fear it would give criminals the upper hand. Griffith said to prevent violence on campus the answer is not in security and safety protocol but in school culture. “We always need to monitor closely our students,” he said. “We need to give them other options than talking to the friends about how much they want to damage the school and seek help instead.” Counseling on campus provided by the Tuolumne County Superintendent of Schools Office will be available Monday. But, Mele and Griffith said law enforcement presence and security on campus will not be increased. \n“At this time I want to reassure the community that there is no further threat to the students or staff,” said Mele.
