(AP) - It looks like the case of some missing sleeping bags at a New Hampshire high school has been put to bed.\nConcord police received a report that 15 sleeping bags were missing from Concord High School last month. They were used in a course called \"Reaching Our Potential in Education.\"\nStaff told police the class stored the sleeping bags, worth a total of $1,900, inside a locked room back in June. But they were gone this fall.\nThe school conducted an extensive search and called police.\nShortly after putting out a news release Friday, Concord police got a call from the school that the sleeping bags were recovered. It appears they were sent out for dry-cleaning over the summer - but that wasn't known to the people looking for them.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
