At the end of the day South Africa won the game and we weren't good enough to win. \n\"At the end of the day South Africa did what South Africa do. They hung in there right until the end. They got one chance and they took it and that was the result.\" \nThe New Zealander now will turn his attention to the RBS 6 Nations campaign and will hope the likes of Rhys Webb, Leigh Halfpenny and Jonathan Davies can come back into the fold after injury. \nGatland added: \"There's a number of players that will come back in the next four to six months. We've got the Six Nations to look forward to now and then a tour of New Zealand next year.\" \nSpringboks captain Du Preez couldn't contain his delight after going over to put South Africa in front after trailing for the majority of the second half. \nDu Preez said: \"I must say it was an awesome feeling in a tight game. I was just delighted that we could pull it through. \n\"It was a tough game and they came on to us all game. We just kept pushing, kept pushing. \n\"We've still got two more games to go, obviously New Zealand or France. We've learnt from the Japan game and the character from this team and the belief is amazing.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:09:19.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
