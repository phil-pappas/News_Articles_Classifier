He practiced on Wednesday, splitting reps with backup quarterback E.J. Manuel, but was not seen at practice on Thursday, NFL.com’s Marc Sessler reports.\nManuel is slated to start Sunday for the Bills. He has appeared in three games this season and started one, throwing for 263 yards and one touchdown.\nWatkins did not practice Thursday either after sustaining an ankle sprain last Sunday against the Cincinatti Bengals. In four games this season, Watkins has made 11 receptions in 18 chances for 147 yards and two touchdowns.\nIn addition to Taylor and Watkings, Ryan said wide receiver Percy Harvin (hip), defensive tackle Kyle Williams (knee), right tackle Seantrel Henderson (concussion) and running back Karlos Williams (concussion) would also be out on Sunday.\nHarvin has been dealing with a lingering hip injury, but reportedly did not join the team in London for personal reasons. On Thursday, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Percy was contemplating his NFL future in the wake of hip and knee injuries that are expected to keep him out indefinitely. Vic Carucci of The Buffalo News reported that Harvin could be considering retirement.\n- Erin Flynn\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/657179009747283968", "https://twitter.com/mikerodak/status/657173740585881600", "http://www.si.com/", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000562820/article/no-sign-of-tyrod-taylor-at-start-of-bills-practice", "http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/21/buffalo-bills-percy-harvin-out-jaguars-london-personal-reasons", "https://twitter.com/viccarucci/status/657174662598774784", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:25:19.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
