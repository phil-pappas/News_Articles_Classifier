After a tough loss to Smyrna last week, the Senators bounced back nicely in a dominating effort over the Panthers. Dover took control early, building a 23-0 lead after one quarter. The Senators would add two more scores before the first half came to a close, leading Polytech 37-0 at the break. With the lead in hand in the second half, Dover would score once more to give them the 43-0 victory. The Panthers continue to struggle on both sides of the ball, being shutout Monday for the third time this season while falling to 0-5 overall. Polytech will be the guest at another team’s homecoming later this week when they travel north to Baynard Stadium where they’ll take on DMA Friday night at 7 p.m. Dover is also on the road later this week, hoping to keep pace in the Henlopen North taking on divisional foe Cape Henlopen Friday night at 7:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:12:49.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
