Saturday is no different, especially against a typically sound program in what should be a hostile environment.\nThe Horned Frogs play away from Fort Worth for the second time in three weeks and have a trip to Iowa State waiting next week, making this a key stretch to play through. TCU is 2-0 on the road this season, having won those contests by a combined nine points. The point differential is significantly different at home.\nKansas State comes off a two-point loss at Oklahoma State, going down on a last-minute field goal. The Wildcats likely can't afford another loss should they hope to compete for a Big 12 crown. -- Jose Rodriguez\nWho: No. 2 TCU (5-0, 2-0 big 12) at Kansas State (3-1, 0-1)\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Saturday\nWhere: Bill Snyder Family Stadium in Manhattan, Kan.\nTV/radio: FOX / WBAP-AM (820), KTCU-FM (88.7)\nLine: TCU-10 (as of Tuesday afternoon)\nFull coverage: Predictions, analysis and more\nClick here to visit the Horned Frogs page\nTCU prediction: Behind Boykin, Horned Frogs pull away late on the road\nFive things TCU fans should know about Kansas State, including its QB carousel\nBig 12 power rankings (10/7): TCU, Baylor hold serve with dominating efforts\nBest in Texas (10/5): Baylor, TCU in fight for top spot; Houston gains ground on Texas Tech\nBest in Texas breakdown (10/5): Longhorns well behind in-state rivals; SMU remains a mystery\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcuhornedfrogs/2015/10/06/five-things-tcu-fans-know-kansas-state-including-qb-carousel", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-105-baylor-tcu-fight-top-spot-houston-gains-ground-texas-tech", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcu-horned-frogs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/06/big-12-power-rankings-107-tcu-baylor-hold-serve-dominating-efforts", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/tcu-prediction-behind-boykin-horned-frogs-pull-away-late-road", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-breakdown-105-longhorns-behind-state-rivals-smu-remains-mystery"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:14:42.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
