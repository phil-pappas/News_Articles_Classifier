Bill Lackey/Staff Related Contributing Writer SPRINGFIELD — \nThe finally healthy Shawnee football team has found its offense. But like every other team that plays Kenton Ridge, the Braves couldn’t find a way to slow down Jayden Davis on Friday night. \nDavis ran through big holes thanks to his big offensive line. He broke tackles. He found the end zone twice. He gained 242 yards on 21 carries to surpass 1,000 yards this season. And lots of Davis was what the Cougars needed to keep the ball away from the Braves for a back-and-forth 41-28 victory at Shawnee. \nThe Cougars defense put an end to Shawnee’s hopes with a fourth-and-1 stand at their 10-yard line with 2:21 left. Davis added a 51-yard touchdown a minute later. \nKenton Ridge entered the week in third place in Division IV, Region 12 playoff points. The Cougars could gain many more points the final three weeks with games against Bellefontaine (2-5), Stebbins (6-1) and Tippecanoe (6-1). \nAfter Shawnee (2-5, 1-1 Central Buckeye Conference Kenton Trail) returned an interception for a touchdown late in the first half, the Cougars (6-1, 2-0) mostly stuck to the ground. Davis did most of the work, but quarterback Noah Schleinitz made some big runs, too. \nTied 14-all at the half, the teams traded touchdowns until Schleintz’s 34-yard run set up Kobe Holtz’s three-yard touchdown run for a 35-28 lead with 6:05 left. \nSchleinitz started the second half with a 20-yard touchdown run. Shawnee answered with Alec Bennett’s 24-yard touchdown pass to David Barnett. Then it was Davis from 11 yards out followed by Shawnee’s Josh Nelson from three yards out. \nOther than an impressive opening drive by the Cougars that ended in Jayden Davis’ four-yard touchdown run, the first half was a defensive battle until the final three-plus minutes. The last big defensive play tied the score 7-7 when Shawnee’s David Barnett returned an interception 38 yards for a touchdown. \nThen the offenses took over. \nThe Cougars started it with a six-play, 60-yard drive on all running plays. Davis, who had 78 yards on 10 carries in the first half, ripped off runs of 25 and 28 yards to move the ball to the 1-yard line. Kobe Holtz scored from there for a 14-7 lead with 56 seconds left in the half. \nThe Braves then went 69 yards in five plays to the score 14-14 with one second left on Josh Nelson’s two-yard run. The drive started with Alec Bennett’s 40-yard pass to Michael Guyer.
