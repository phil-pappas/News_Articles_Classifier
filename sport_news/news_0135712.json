So quarterback Chris McQuire did some scrambling of his own to keep NHS in the hunt. It helped give Nokomis its third straight victory, a 21-20 decision over Kincaid South Fork on Friday night. Nokomis (3-4) trailed the Ponies 20-14 early in the fourth quarter. NHS coach Gabe Cesaretti said his team faced a fourth-and-goal at the South Fork 9-yard line. “We ran a pass play,” Cesaretti said. “Chris couldn’t find anybody open, so he scrambled for a touchdown. “It’s great to have an athletic kid who can do things like that sometimes. He’s been great at that this year.” McQuire added the extra point for a 21-20 lead with 10 minutes 29 seconds left. Late in the game, Nokomis’ Aaron Lovelace then forced a South Fork fumble recovered by McQuire, and NHS held on. The Ponies (1-6) fell to Mount Olive 14-8 in Week Six. Nokomis plays at Mount Olive (4-3) this coming Friday. “South Fork came out really aggressive; they were ready to go and got after us,” Cesaretti said. “They always play us tough.” PURPLE RIDERS ROLL: For Niantic Sangamon Valley, the bad news was a 42-0 loss to fellow unbeaten Arcola, a team “as good as advertised,” according to Sangamon Valley coach Michael Lee. The good news was, Friday didn’t end the Storm’s season. And Sangamon Valley will be Class 2A for the playoffs while the Purple Riders will be 1A. “They’ll be a tough out in 1A, a really tough out,” Lee said of the Riders, who shut down Sangamon Valley’s attack by holding the Storm to 103 net offensive yards. “I thought our defense actually played pretty well,” Lee said. “We gave them two big plays all night. But we couldn’t sustain any drives. “I think we made them punt six or seven times, but we’d go three and out and gave the ball back. Their defensive line was a handful. They’re not all that big, but they’re quick. It’s tough to go around them or through them.” TOUGH LUCK FOR WALTON: Carlinville is 5-2 after Friday’s 42-19 win over Hillsboro as the Cavaliers’ defense held the Hiltoppers’ standout running back, Caleb Jackson, to 36 second-half yards (for 132 total). The Cavaliers also got 216 yards and five touchdowns from junior running back Jacob Dixon. Page 2 of 2 - But not all the news was good for the Cavies. Junior quarterback Adam Walton, making his first start since suffering a broken collarbone in Week One against Roxana, suffered a similar injury in the first quarter on Friday and is out for the season. Easterday was uncertain whether the collarbone snapped in the same spot it did previously. “He’d been tackled three or four times before, and things were fine,” Carlinville coach Chad Easterday said. “But he kind of got whipped to the ground going for the end zone. “We feel very bad for Adam. But there’s light at the end of the tunnel. He can recover in the offseason and come back next year.” Carlinville’s expected to go with freshman quarterback Jarret Easterday, son of the coach, for the rest of the season. BURGER’S BIG WEEKEND: It couldn’t get much better for Connor Burger than it did this weekend. The New Berlin senior was crowned homecoming king, and he scored four touchdowns Friday night in the Pretzels’ 34-27 win over Athens. Burger caught a halfback pass from Hunter Stockton for a 39-yard TD that pulled the Pretzels within 27-26 in the third quarter. He later got the ball on a reverse and ran it 48 yards for what proved to be the game-winner early in the fourth. “It got kind of bottled up,” New Berlin coach Barry Creviston said of the reverse. “We couldn’t formulate it well enough where everyone (for Athens) was fooled. “They sniffed it out, but Connor turned it up the middle. Most of (the Warriors) had gone outside. He’s pretty fast.” — Contact Dave Kane: 788-1544, dave.kane @sj-r.com, twitter.com/davekaneSJR By Dave Kane , Staff Writer Lincoln Courier By Dave Kane , Staff Writer Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 6:06 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:48:48.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
