Kate Brown and Umpqua Community College interim President Rita Cavin held hands Monday as they toured the campus. They talked with students and faculty who were returning to the Roseburg school for the first time after a gunman killed nine and injured nine others 11 days earlier.\n\"There's still a lot of healing that needs to happen,\" Brown said at a news conference after the tour. \"Students I talked to need a lot of support and a lot of love.\"\nThey found it Monday morning on the narrow, winding road that leads to the college. Hundreds of Roseburg residents lined nearby streets, holding up flags and signs in support of students. Drivers wiped away tears as they moved past.\n\"We feel like we are in a bubble of love,\" Cavin said.\nCavin said administrators have not begun talking about what will happen to Snyder Hall, the site of the shooting. Eventually, they will include community members in a conversation about about a plan for the building. For now, Cavin said she was focused on bringing students back. Cavin said many students aren't ready to return yet.\n\"It's so important that students get back in class and get back to studying and have a sense of normalcy,\" she said. \"This isn't quite normal, but we're trying.\"\nBrown has been in \"constant contact\" with school leaders, Cavin said.\nThe governor's spokeswoman, Kristen Grainger, said Brown was initially scheduled to leave for her Asia mission Saturday. But she remained in Oregon to participate in today's reopening.\n\"It was really important to her to do this,\" Grainger said. \"We wanted to let Umpqua Community College reopen the way they thought would be best. And they wanted the governor to be part of this.\"\nBrown left for her trip later Monday, Grainger said. The cost associated with Brown's itinerary change wasn't immediately clear.\nThe governor has pledged to support the school however she can. But ultimately, Brown said, the best aid will come from the town.\n\"This is a very strong and resilient community,\" Brown said. \"They will provide the support these students need to move forward.\"\nDenis Theriault of The Oregonian/OregonLive staff contributed to this report.\n-- Casey Parks\ncparks@oregonian.com\n503-221-8271\n@caseyparks", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/caseyparks"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:03:57.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
