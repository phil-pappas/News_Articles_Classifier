(AP) — Even before now-former players accused him of running a racially hostile program, Illinois women’s basketball coach Matt Bollant sensed the atmosphere in the locker room and the tone of the program needed to change. \nAt the team’s media day Thursday, Bollant said close losses last season weighed on the team. \n“Before any of that happened, I said this needs to be a reflection of me,” the fourth-year coach said. “Moving forward it’s going to be my voice. Anyone who knows me knows I’m optimistic.” \nThe accusations against Bollant and now-former assistant Mike Divilbiss followed the 15-16 season, one in which the team lost seven straight. \nThe lawsuit accused the coaches of holding segregated practices for less-favored players, using more severe discipline for black players, barring white and black players from rooming together and using derogatory terms for black players, among other things. \nThe allegations became public in May and, in July, the subject of an ongoing lawsuit filed seven now-former players. \nDivilbiss left the team, but an outside law firm hired by the university said the allegations were unfounded, and Bollant kept his job. \nHis team heads into the season with a roster of just 11 players. \nBut they include 6-3 center Chatrice White, an honorable mention All Big Ten player last season and a member of the under-19 U.S. national team that won the world championship last summer. One of her opponents at that tournament, 5-7 freshman guard Jaelyne Kirkpatrick of Canada, is also on the roster. \nBollant believes his team has a chance to win some of those close games it lost last year. \n“I think we took a huge step last year,” he said. “We were so close last year.” \nIllinois will open the season Nov. 7 with an exhibition against Indianapolis. The Illini will play their first four regular-season games at Parkland College in Champaign while renovation work continues on the State Farm Center.
