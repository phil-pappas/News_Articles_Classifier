They seem to think the winningest quarterback of his era needs outside forces to motivate him. The beauty of Brady is he does not.\nHis motivation to beat you, or in this weekend’s case beat the Dallas Cowboys, does not need outside stimulus. He does not need Greg Hardy’s classless remarks, or Roger Goodell talking about having no regrets over the Deflategate fiasco to push him. He handles that himself.\nIn fact, those who suggested this week that he will beat the bejeezus out of the Cowboys Sunday afternoon because he’s “pissed” at Hardy for being what the world knows he is (which is to politely say not the brightest bulb in the box), or because he’s “pissed” at Goodell and his other Deflategate accusers have little understanding of what motivates him.\nTom Brady doesn’t need to be angry at anybody to work harder on the smallest detail of his craft than anybody else in his sport.\nTom Brady doesn’t need to feign being insulted that someone thinks his supermodel wife is attractive (duh) to prepare himself for every minute detail about the Cowboys this season and in seasons past to be ready for every possibility.\nTom Brady doesn’t need Greg Hardy to inspire him to get to AT&T Stadium earlier than usual Sunday to check where the stadium clocks are or search for what other quirks might affect his performance in an unfamiliar venue.\nHe doesn’t want to beat the Cowboys any more today than he did before Greg Hardy reconfirmed what many already believed, which is to say Hardy is a classless fellow who has been blessed with a large body, unusual agility and a load of fast twitch muscles which in combination have made him a very good pass rusher but not a very smart person.\nYet talk radio and the blogosphere couldn’t jump faster on the mistaken notion that now he did after Hardy said: “I love seeing Tom Brady. He’s cool as crap. Have you seen his wife (Gisele Bundchen)? I hope she comes to the game, I hope her sister comes to the game, all her friends come to the game. One of my favorite games of the year, guys.\n“I hope I come out guns blazing. I’m full of excitement and full of juice.”\nThe stupidity of this statement almost knows no bounds, although to be fair, what Hardy said about Brady’s wife was not exactly insulting beyond the idea of bringing her up at all. So let’s look at the rest of this genius’ soliloquy.\nA guy who was accused of allegedly throwing his then-girlfriend by her hair onto a sofa covered with firearms and threatening to kill her if she told the media wants to come out “guns blazing?” Wonder what his SAT scores were.\nHe adds he’s “full of juice.” I’ll bet.\nIf you really think any of this has inspired Brady to new heights of preparation you have no understanding of Brady and little understanding of highly successful athletes. It is precisely because they do not need this type of nonsense to motivate them that they exceed their coworkers. Tom Brady doesn’t need any motivation beyond a sign that says “Game Today” outside a football stadium to motivate him.\nThat’s why, at an age when nearly all professional athletes have begun to recede, he continues to dominate. It is not because he’s “pissed” at anyone, I can assure you of that. It’s because he is more competitive than most of his peers and because he not only is smarter but works harder than most of them. Most of all, it’s because he remains open to the notion of working as hard at his craft today as he did when he was back in San Mateo, a tall, skinny kid with dreams of things few around him thought possible.\nHe didn’t succeed at Michigan because he was “pissed” at Lloyd Carr. He succeeded against long odds and difficult circumstances because he believed in himself when few others did and rather than get angry about it, went out every day trying to improve himself rather than worry about them.\nHe succeeded in the NFL not because he was “pissed” about being the 199th player drafted 15 years ago (although he was) but because he didn’t let that affect either who he thought he was or how hard he worked.\nLong after becoming the best quarterback in the game, he continues to succeed not because he’s “pissed” at those who insult him, question his team’s honesty or make rude remarks about his wife. He continues to succeed because nothing about how he approaches his job has changed. He still takes nothing for granted, including the required work.\nThe most telling thing Greg Hardy said during his Monologue on Madness came not while speaking about Brady but rather when asked what he learned from his four-game suspension for domestic violence.\n“I’m a really good pass rusher when I put my mind to it,” Hardy opined.\nNow there’s some introspection.\nBut there’s more than that in his statement. There’s the difference between Hardy, a sometimes great pass rusher, and Brady, an always great quarterback. One puts his mind to his job sometimes. The other all the time.\nThat’s what separates Brady from the rest. It’s also why someone like Hardy, or Rex Ryan and his herd of testosterone-overloaded Bills, regularly lose to him. Brady doesn’t need them to motivate him to crush them. He handles that himself.\n“Nah, I’m just getting ready to play, man,” Brady said when asked if he was bothered by Hardy’s remarks. “I’ve got to focus on my job … I really don’t care about his personal feelings.”\nBeing “pissed” at a fool or an NFL executive on a fool’s errand doesn’t help him to accomplish that. Nor does he need it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:38:45.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
