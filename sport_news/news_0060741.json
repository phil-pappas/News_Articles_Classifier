As thoroughly beaten as United were last week, they were just as impressive this week in defeating Everton handily, by a score of 3-0 at Goodison Park. Van Gaal is a “happy coach,” as very well should be. \nHere is the YouTube of the Louis van Gaal post match interview embedded below: \nAnd below you’ll find the YouTube of the Louis van Gaal post match press conference. United remain in third place. \nThey are tied with Arsenal in points (19), but the Gunners are up on United in goal differential by two. \nNext Sunday will be a monster of a Manchester Derby. \nThey’ll host table topping Manchester City, who will be without Sergio Aguero, and quite possibly without David Silva as well. Maybe Van Gaal will be a happy coach again after that contest? \nPaul M. Banks owns, operates and sometimes writes The Sports Bank.net , which is partnered with FOX Sports Engage Network.
