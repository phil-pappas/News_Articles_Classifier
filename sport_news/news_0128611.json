You're a fool.\" (Mary Schwalm / Associated Press) Jeff Jacobs Contact Reporter Jeff Jacobs Fans can be awful in this era of social media: Just ask the Colts or the Wolverines \nSTORRS â€” When the Colts' Griff Whalen leaned over the football Sunday night in Indianapolis, he didn't count on snapping his way onto to a list that includes Pete Carroll, Fred Merkle, Leon Lett, Jim Marshall and Jean van de Velde. \nWhen Michigan's Blake O'Neill dropped back to punt Saturday at the Big House, he certainly didn't count on moving into the Big House of Permanent Humiliation along with Chris Webber, Steve Bartman, Andres Escobar and Bill Buckner. \nBut there they are today. \nThere is a certain sobriety in our land, an undeniable perspective capable of addressing problems, apportioning the correct blame and finding the necessary remedy. It's just not going to be found in sports. Not in 2015. Not when fans believe they are as important as the players. Not when the ever-devolving media, led by radio talk show hosts armed with pitchforks and torches and schooled in hyperbolic arson, are certain they have all the answers. \nThe tweets started immediately. Some emails followed Saturday night and Sunday. Coach Bob Diaco and offensive coordinator Frank Verducci had made some calls that turned bad in a 28-20 loss to South Florida. The Huskies went for it on fourth-and-1 on the opening drive and got snuffed. With eight seconds to go, the Huskies stupidly decided to run another play instead of kicking a sure field goal, didn't get out of bounds and the clock expired. There were a few other plays, too. (Chuck Schilken) \nDid Diaco deserve to be second-guessed? Of course, he did and he was in this space. Did he deserve to be second-guessed after the 9-6 loss at Mizzou, especially on the fake field goal and interception? Of course, he did. And he was in this space. \nBut some of these tweets and emails I've gotten have left me shaking my head, or smh as the social media shorthand goes. Diaco has finally started to turn around this program, one that had sunk into a cruel joke the past three years, and some people want his head on a platter? Really? He finally got the team to where they are competitive with just about anyone and the outrage over one play ruins the improving stuff on the other plays? I was unaware marijuana had been legalized in Connecticut. (Tribune wire reports) \nYet as outrageous as some of this stuff is, it is impossible to dismiss it out of hand. Big decisions should never be made in the heat of the moment, but if there are thousands and thousands of fanatics, fueled by what passes as responsible media today, trending in one emotional direction, sanity can sometimes be a casualty. Owners, college presidents, athletic directors can be held hostage to an extent by the whimsy of the crazed masses. It takes a brave man or woman to stand true. \nAfter he bobbled the snap and foolishly tried to pick up the ball and punt it away instead of just falling on it, O'Neill did worse than allow a touchdown. He allowed a touchdown as time expired to lose to dreaded rival Michigan State. It has been suggested that O'Neill fell prey to his Australian rules roots and did what was natural for him and that's do anything to move the ball along in such a situation. \nYet some of the reaction was anything but natural. Telling him to go back to Australia was one of the milder responses. Death threats and telling O'Neill to go commit suicide would be among the harsher. Death threats? Great. \nThe outrage directed toward coach Chuck Pagano, Whalen and the Colts, meanwhile, centered more on ending their jobs. Yet make no mistake, it was no more muted. In fact, it has gone on longer and louder in New England and in Indy, around the NFL entertainment machine that is television. \nAnd that's why I asked Diaco on Tuesday about the psychology of coaching trick plays, going for it on fourth down, etc. And how you handle the fallout. \n\"You have these exotics, exotics that the team is excited about,\" Diaco said. \"Because of the people in the arena on the front end, doing the work, everybody knows it's a 50-50 deal. It's exciting. It's an energizer. Even if it doesn't work, it can manifest itself in another area, like maybe it slows the rush down, or a backside guy stops crashing, or they loosen up the coverage so we can run a little more. \n\"Everything is explained. It can produce a big play or even if it doesn't, creates a circumstance that is working for us.\" \nDiaco pointed to what was a big problem early on this season. Extra points were getting blocked. Field goals were attempted under duress. \n\"Our field goal protection has improved, but it also may be the fact that [the opponent's] attack has slowed down based on the fact we're very willing to fake field goals,\" he said. \"Sometimes it works even when it doesn't work. Internally the guys don't get upset when they don't work.\" \nBut what about the fallout? That Colts' play turned into one of the biggest jokes in recent sports memory. It's one thing to try that trick, swinging-gate play on fourth-and-3. High schools do it. Colleges do it. \nBut when it's clear the Patriots had two guys surrounding the snapper, it never should have been snapped. Down 27-21 in the third quarter from their own 37, the Colts were still in the game. Punter Pat McAfee lined up wide right. Whalen, a wide receiver, lined up at center. Safety Colt Anderson played quarterback. There was no way it was going to work and it didn't. At that moment, everybody in American thought the same thing. Bill Belichick gets so deep into the other team's heads that they outsmart themselves and end up as morons. \nPagano tried to take full responsibility, but in a half-hearted manner by using the generic \"communication breakdown.\" It took McAfee to explain the situation on \"The Bob & Tom\" radio show that Whalen was a backup in that situation and had no real knowledge of what was happening. He was in because Clayton Geathers was hurt earlier in the game. \n\"The fallout you just deal with,\" Diaco said. \"You understand as a coach and a player if it works, you understand you are the smartest guy on the planet, you're a riverboat gambler, you're a gunslinger, you're the Mad Hatter. If it doesn't, you're a goat. You're a fool. You're good on it either way.\" \nFaced with fourth-and-2 from the Michigan State 47, with a two-point lead and 10 seconds to go, Diaco said he felt Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh made the right call to punt and avoid a Hail Mary pass or some sort of pass to the sideline to attempt a field goal. \n\"That's what the book says to do, although where that [book] is, I don't know,\" Diaco said. \"But those moments are interesting. That's what makes it fun and you guys get to write stuff. And that's cool.\" \nThe fun, of course, ends when you are the one on the opposite side of the fan's saber and the media's musket. \n\"Why's the punter out there?\" Diaco said. \"To punt the ball. Everything he has done is to operate as fast as he can to punt. To coach that moment of, 'Oh, if you just would have fallen on it, the game would have expired and we would have won,' he's not even going on the field thinking that scenario. And not one person in the crowd of [111,740] was thinking about it, including the coaches on the other side.\" \nDiaco said holders for field goals do get coached on time and situation. But, rarely, does the moment require falling on a mishandled punt with time expiring. \n\"I'm sure everyone in the country will [coach it] now,\" Diaco said. \nProbably. \n\"Look, as a coach you come in, take accountability and try to protect your players,\" Diaco said. \"In 2015, insulating ourselves is a challenge. You can get me anytime you want. I got two phones, three phones, email here, email there, everybody is tracking everything. Our players are out there communicating on platforms that are wide open for anyone to come in and be crushing. People can be mean.\" \nYes, they can be. And stupid, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:32:51.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
