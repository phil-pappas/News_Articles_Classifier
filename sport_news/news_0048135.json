LOUIS â€” For one inning, Jorge Soler and all those Chicago Cubs rookies looked like playoff-tested veterans and the St. Louis Cardinals appeared shaken.\nThat's all it took.\nKyle Hendricks and Addison Russell had successful squeeze bunts and Soler capped a five-run (all unearned) second inning with a two-run homer off Jaime Garcia, and the Cubs held off the Cardinals 6-3 on Saturday night to even their NL division series at a game apiece.\n\"Listen, I can't be more proud of our guys,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"When you win a wild-card game like we did, I promise you, you settle in. We didn't win yesterday, but we were not overwhelmed by anything.\"\nMaddon made all the right moves a night after the Cubs lost the opener 4-0. Now the teams shift to Wrigley Field for Game 3 on Monday, the first playoff game at the friendly confines since 2008, where Chicago's 22-game winner Jake Arrieta faces St. Louis' Michael Wacha in the best-of-five series.\n\"Getting back there 1-1 with our big dog on the mound, the atmosphere is going to be good,\" Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said.\nThe usually steady NL Central champion Cardinals made two errors as the Cubs didn't hit the ball out of the infield in scoring their first three runs in the second.\n\"It is hard to watch a club that's played so well defensively, see a couple things happen that are kind of uncharacteristic for us,\" Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:28:16.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
