Honda stroked home the spot kick and Okazaki scored from close range soon after to make it 2-0. Former Bayern Munich forward Takashi Usami sealed the win late in the game. \n\"We knew this would be a tough game for us,\" Japan's Bosnian coach Vahid Halilhodzic said after the game. \"We came through it and now can look forward to the next challenge.\" \nThe win puts Japan a point clear of Syria and two ahead of Singapore, which had a 1-0 win over Afghanistan. \nA first half header from Koo Ja-cheol gave South Korea a 1-0 win in Kuwait to make it four wins from four in Group G. The Taeguk Warriors were missing injured English Premier League stars Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace's Lee Chung-yong. \nQatar also maintained maximum points with a 1-0 win over China, to move five points clear of the visitor. \nIt was an encouraging night overall for southeast Asian soccer. Iraq needed an injury-time penalty from Younis Mahmoud to salvage a 1-1 draw in Vietnam and move two points behind Group F leader Thailand. \nNorth Korea's winning streak in World Cup qualifying came to an end with a 0-0 draw against the Philippines. \nThe North Koreans lead Group H with 10 points from four game but are not just a point clear of Uzbekistan who won 4-0 in Bahrain. \nAn injury-time goal from Abu Nahyeh gave Palestine a 1-1 draw against East Timor. Turkmenistan defeated India 2-1, Maldives defeated Bhutan 4-3 and Lebanon beat Myanmar 2-0. \nThe top team from each of the eight groups and the best four second-place teams advance to the next round of qualifying.
