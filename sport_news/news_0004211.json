Two months earlier, such a celebration was almost impossible to imagine. Yet, with their 15-2 rout of Baltimore on Wednesday, the Blue Jays brought an appropriate conclusion to their unstoppable, late-season run. Toronto entered the doubleheader needing only one victory to eliminate the New York Yankees and claim its first title since 1993. The suspense ended quickly as the Blue Jays built a 4-0 lead in the fourth inning before adding four unearned runs in the fifth. The remaining innings were a mere prelude to a celebration more than two decades in the making. There were several hundred blue-clad Toronto fans in the small crowd that gathered for the makeup of a game washed out by rain on Tuesday. \"You're on the road, but it felt like a home game,\" said Marcus Stroman, who pitched eight strong innings. \"I thought the majority of the stadium was Blue Jays fans. So that just goes to show how excited people are to take the trip down from the North to see us clinch. It's been special.\" Because there was a second game to be played, the Blue Jays opted to put off the champagne celebration until after the nightcap. After waiting this long to toast a division title, a few hours probably wasn't going to make much of a difference. \"Everyone is elated,\" Stroman said. \"Everyone is ecstatic and happy. But we have 30 minutes in between games so we have to lock it back in quickly. I am sure there will be a celebration postgame.\" Stroman (4-0) allowed one run and five hits with eight strikeouts in his fourth start since returning from left knee surgery. Jose Bautista hit his 40th home run, Edwin Encarnacion delivered No. 37 and Justin Smoak also connected for Toronto. Ryan Goins had a career-high five hits to help the Blue Jays win their sixth straight. Orsillo lands with Padres SAN DIEGO — Don Orsillo has landed with the San Diego Padres after being ousted as the Boston Red Sox's television play-by-play voice. The Padres said that Orsillo has signed a long-term deal and will become the primary television play-by-play broadcaster on FOX Sports San Diego when Dick Enberg retires after next season. Next year, Orsillo will do select games on television and radio. In Boston, Orsillo wasn't offered a new contract with NESN and is being replaced by Dave O'Brien. Orsillo first broadcast Red Sox games on NESN in 2001 and became the full-time play-by-play man in 2005 when the network acquired rights to all local telecasts. Orsillo was popular with Red Sox fans, but his true popularity seemed to catch the club by surprise only after the news leaked that he wouldn't be brought back. Fans brought signs to the games begging the team to keep him, and a petition to bring him back garnered more than 65,000 online signatures. Page 2 of 2 - Cardinals clinch division PITTSBURGH — The St. Louis Cardinals are back in a familiar spot: on top of the NL Central looking down at everyone else. Jason Heyward's third-inning grand slam powered the Cardinals over the Pittsburgh Pirates 11-1 in the second game of a doubleheader, giving St. Louis its third straight division title and 11th since 1994. This one may be among the most impressive. The Cardinals and assured themselves of the best record in the majors this season despite losing several stars to injury for long stretches. Heyward's shot off Bobby LaFromboise, who replaced an ineffective Charlie Morton (9-9), gave St. Louis an early six-run lead. Tyler Lyons (3-1) had little trouble making it hold up as the Cardinals reached the 100-win plateau for the ninth time. Twins win 4th straight CLEVELAND — Kyle Gibson wants to be known for excelling in key moments, and he came through in his most important start yet. Gibson (11-11) threw six shutout innings and Torii Hunter had a three-run double as the Minnesota Twins gained ground in the AL wild-card race, winning their fourth straight with a 7-1 victory over the fading Cleveland Indians in the first game of a doubleheader. Joe Mauer and Byron Buxton hit solo homers for Minnesota, which entered play trailing the Angels by 1 1/2 games for the AL's second wild card. The loss dealt another setback to Cleveland's slim playoff hopes. The Indians enter the nightcap six wins behind the Angels with six games left.
