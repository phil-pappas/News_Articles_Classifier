John Clark, founder of the Oneida Legion Post 727 baseball program and ROWVA High School coach since 2002 died late Wednesday night at home. He was 62. Funeral arrangements are pending. \"It was just devastating,\" Jake Dixon, a former Legion player for Clark who went on to a college and pro career, said of hearing the news . \"I have the utmost respect for him. He had a tremendous impact on my life.\" \"It's just a reminder of how precious life is. He had a fall league practice out on the diamond last night\" said Tim Farquer, a former Babe Ruth player for Clark, now superintendent of Williamsfield schools, a baseball co-op partner with ROWVA last spring. \"It's just terrible,\" said former Galesburg Legion coach Steve Cheesman, a frequent opponent. \"First and foremost, he was a terrific human being. \"He was a pinnacle of the baseball community around here.\" \"When people in our community thought about baseball, the first person they thought of was John Clark,\" said ROWVA superintendent Joe Sornberger. \"Not only did he teach baseball but he also taught life lessons. For that we are forever greatful.\" Clark, a graduate of what was then known as ROVA High School, started the Oneida Legion program in the 1990s which drew players from the ROWVA, AlWood, Galva, Williamsfield, Princeville and Stark County areas and occasionally, even Galesburg. He began coaching ROWVA High School in 2002, produced six straight 20-win seasons at one stretch and his success included several regionals and a sectional championship. Dixon recalls a highlight of playing for Clark's Legion team. \"It was when we played Galesburg in the district and we had the opportunity go to farther than any other Oneida team,\" he said. \"I think the game went 11 innings and I pitched nine. It was just s big win for us small town guys.\" But Clark's coaching impact included more than wins and losses. \"One of the best things anybody said about him was how much umpires respected him,\" said Clark's son James, who helped his dad coach and began his own coaching career after playing for him. \"I don't know how many times they told me how much they respected the way he treated them. \"He never tried showing anybody up. He just enjoyed being out on the diamond.\" And anywhere else baseball was being practiced, played or discussed. Dixon, who now resides in North Carolina, recalls Clark stopping by his baseball school in Kewanee just to watch him give lessons. Farquer, who once coached against Clark, remembers him being active in the Greater Peoria Baseball Association and attending that group's meetings to promote his players to college coaches.

Those who knew him agree, Clark may be gone but his influence will remain. \"He was my biggest mentor in terms of coaching,\" said James Clark, now assistant baseball coach and sports information director at Knox College. \"I learned a lot from him. \"He was more level-headed than me. Hopefully, that's something I can carry on in my coaching.\" \"The comforting thing is how much his traits get passed down,\" said Farquer. \"With John, it was the honesty, the truth. \"But probably the most amazing thing is ROWVA or Oneida probably wouldn't have baseball without John. He's a reason there's a field there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:09:51.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
