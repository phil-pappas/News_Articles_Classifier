(AP) - Kelvin Taylor rushed for 99 yards and two first-quarter touchdowns and No. 11 Florida defeated Missouri 21-3 on Saturday night.\nThe Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC) amassed 337 yards and possessed the ball for 37:53, converting 23 first downs.\nQuarterback Will Grier targeted eight receivers, completing 20 of 33 passes for 208 yards in his fifth start. Demarcus Robinson led Florida in receiving with six catches for 79 yards.\nFlorida's defense never allowed Missouri's offense to settle into a rhythm. Missouri was 1 of 13 on third down and opened the second half with three consecutive three-and-outs.\nDrew Lock made his second start for Missouri (4-2, 1-2) in place of Maty Mauk, who is suspended indefinitely for violating team policy. He completed 16 of 39 passes for 151 yards, but threw two interceptions, one of which was returned by Jalen Tabor for a 40-yard touchdown.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
