Diamont replaced the injured Nate Sudfeld and Hills had not started in the previous three games for Maryland.\"One thing we did a good job of is responding and making adjustments because we saw some things that we didn't expect to see,\" Ohio State linebacker Joshua Perry said.The Buckeyes have a better idea what they're getting from Hackenberg, a junior who has started the past two seasons against them. He's passed for 1,086 yards with seven touchdowns and two interceptions this season.\"We know we've got a kid in there who's got a pretty good arm, done some great things,\" Perry said.But just as the Buckeyes prepare for Hackenberg the passer, he had touchdown runs of 1 and 5 yards vs. Indiana last week, jokingly drawing comparisons by his coach to OSU quarterback J.T. Barrett.\"Hack is competing right now with Barrett to be the No. 1 dual-threat quarterback in the Big Ten based on last week's performance,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said.Perry feels the Ohio State defense will be ready.\"We're probably going to see something we haven't seen before,\" he said. \"We have to be on the lookout, keep our heads up. We have to be adaptable. That's going to be huge.\"Ohio State ranks 21st in scoring defense (17.3 points per game); tied for 57th against the rush (152.7 yards) and has allowed the ninth fewest passing yards (147.5).The Buckeyes have yielded 11 plays from scrimmage (nine of them passes) that have gone for 20 or more yards.\"Our defense is based on effort, execution and fundamentals,\" Ash said. \"As long as we can see those three things showing up on film we'll keep moving forward. If one those three things is missing we've got to stop, press pause and find out why.\" \nAP Photo/Darron Cummings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:24:36.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
