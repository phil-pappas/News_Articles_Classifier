Pascack Hills coach Scott Ernest looked at his team at halftime. His Cowgirls sat nearby a disheartening scoreboard that showed upset-minded Midland Park ahead by two.\n\"But they had that look in their eye,\" Ernest said of his team in the middle of its first round Bergen County girls soccer tournament game in Montvale.\n\"I was just thinking to myself, ‘These guys are not going to go down this easy.’ And in the second half, we got to it.\"\nSpecifically, Pascack Hills’ Allison Ernest and Erica Bardes got to it.\nThe pair of junior playmakers led the 14th-seeded Cowgirls’ second-half charge en route to a 3-2 overtime win against 19th-seeded Midland Park.\nErnest cut the Cowgirls’ deficit in half and Bardes tied it with 17 minutes left off an Ernest assist. Three minutes into extra time, Bardes struck again, ripping a hard, arcing shot from 20 yards out to ignite a wild celebration and cap the comeback.\n\"As Midland Park was walking off, I said to the girls, ‘We’ve been on that side, we know how that feels,’’’ said Ernest, whose team was 0-2 in OT games this season. \"I think they were motivated to make sure it didn’t happen again. We showed a lot of character. We showed a lot of poise.
