Much more than rivalry bragging rights on line for Georgia-Florida By Marc Weiszer published Sunday, October 25, 2015 close Georgia reached the SEC championship game three times during a four year stretch — in 2002, 2003 and 2005 — in coach Mark Richt’s early years with the Bulldogs despite not leaving Jacksonville with a victory those seasons against Florida. Since then, neither team in the rivalry game has made it to Atlanta without winning the game. Florida was the SEC East champs in 2006, 2008 and 2009 after beating Georgia and the Bulldogs reached the league championship game in 2011 and 2012 following wins over the Gators. It seems likely that trend will continue this year as the division’s two top teams--and only ones with winning records--meet Saturday at 3:30 p.m. on CBS at EverBank Field. “Where it is in the season you’re hoping when you play it’s a huge game for the race to Atlanta,” Richt said. “You know it’s going to be a big game no matter what, whether everybody’s 4-0 in league play or 0-4. It’s going to be a big game when Georgia plays Florida. We know that part. You always want it to be as meaningful as possible. You want it to be on the national stage. You want the game to be relevant in regard to trying to get to the SEC championship game and that’s where we’re at right now so that’s a good thing. Both teams know how important it is.” Georgia (5-2, 3-2 SEC) will win the SEC East by going 3-0 in its final conference games against Florida, Kentucky and Auburn. Florida, under first-year coach Jim McElwain, was picked to finish fifth in the SEC East in the preseason by the media behind Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri and South Carolina. The only loss for the Gators (6-1 overall, 4-1) came in its last game to LSU, 35-28, on Oct. 17. “I think it’s obvious he’s doing a great job getting everybody on the same page and playing as hard as they can,” Richt said. “Just been winning, been winning some big games and have just done a great job, I think.” Said Bulldogs defensive lineman Sterling Bailey: “They’re playing good football right now. They’re winning games and it’s going to be an important game for both of us.” This is just the second time in the last six meetings that Florida, ranked 11 th in this week’s Associated Press poll, enters the game as a ranked opponent. The other was 2012 when No. 12 Georgia upset third-ranked Florida 17-9. An unranked Florida upset No. 9 Georgia 38-20 last season. “I definitely think everyone needs to be a little extra locked in, do a little extra film work, do whatever you have to do to be ready for the game,” Georgia inside linebacker Jake Ganus said. “It’s a big one.” An unranked Georgia team (in the AP poll) last beat a ranked Florida squad on Nov. 11, 1989 when the Bulldogs took down the No. 20 Gators 17-10. The Bulldogs are 0-7 since then in that scenario. Georgia is fifth in others receiving votes this week in the AP, but No. 23 in the coaches’ poll. The rest of the SEC East after Florida and Georgia all have losing conference records with Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Missouri and South Carolina each with just one SEC win. McElwain is the fifth Florida head coach that Richt will have gone up against. He is 5-9 against Steve Spurrier, Ron Zook, Urban Meyer and Will Muschamp with the Gators. “This is what college football is all about,” said McElwain, who has never been in the Jacksonville stadium but has driven by it in recruiting. “I just think these traditions and the fact that it’s played there I think is great. I think it’s a lot of fun for a lot of people and everybody involved. Other than knowing you could kind of set your television by it for a lot of years, I think this is something that the reason you get into this business is to play in these kind of games and be a part of them.” Note: Georgia will leave a day earlier than it usually does for a road game. The team will fly to Jacksonville on Thursday for the first time, Richt said. UGA doesn’t have classes on Friday this week. “We thought we could get in there and let them get a good night’s sleep,” he said. “Even sleep in a little bit on Friday and get into our routine like we normally would have on a Friday. We thought we’d give that a shot and see how that worked.” The change comes after Georgia lost last season and is another travel switch this season. The team is flying out of Athens instead of Atlanta and is staying in town at the Georgia Center for home games. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:09:50.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
