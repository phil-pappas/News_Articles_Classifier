Be it these paid ho‚Äôs, or the hostesses that show them around on their visits to the campuses. Why do you think football players who have committed to schools take visits to the other schools.

I‚Äôve heard stories of Louisville cheer coaches partying with their cheerleaders and taking lots of drugs (the overdose of their teammate last year further proves this), Morehead cheerleaders have been seen chugging beers before camps, practices, and games, yet nothing from UK. It may go on everywhere but from what I‚Äôve seen, UK is pretty strict when it comes to things like this. (Or maybe they‚Äôre just good at hiding it?)
