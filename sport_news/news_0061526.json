So it’s hard to imagine either one of them having a crisis of confidence on the ice. Yet here they sit, one goal between them — a shorthanded tally by Hossa on Saturday, no less — through the first six games of the season.\nAnd yeah, even top guys start squeezing the stick a little tighter.\n“Some guys are more natural to get into it right away, and [for] some it takes longer,” Hossa said before Thursday’s game against the Florida Panthers. “You score a goal right away, you get the confidence sooner. [If] you cannot score, then the confidence comes a little bit later. It’s all about timing, I think. Even for the best players, like Sidney Crosby — it took five games for him to get a point. So even one of the best of us needs a longer period of time. But world-class players like that, you’re not worried about those guys.”\nAnd no, nobody’s worried about Toews and Hossa, either. But if the Hawks are going to get their offense going and stabilize their ever-changing lineup, it’s going to start with the two big guns on the top line.\n“I can speak for myself and say that I need to find that energy and that jump that I haven’t had my first handful of games,” Toews said. “It makes things easier just being in the right places, winning your battles, all those things that come from playing with energy. … The two of us want to get to that level we were playing at at the end of the season last year. It’s not an easy thing, especially early. But I think at the end of the day, once we kind of settle in and shake off that rust a little bit, we’ll be able to settle down and it won’t matter as much who’s playing with us.”\nToews, like most players, has been here before. He had an 11-game goal drought around New Year’s last year. He scored once in a 14-game stretch in 2013-14. And he had one goal in the first 17 games of the 2013 playoff run. Each time, Toews has talked about needing to see the puck go in just once, just to get that confidence back.\nBut if he wants to do that, he’ll have to start playing more selfishly. Through six games, he has only put 11 shots on goal. As a center, it’s his natural instinct to want to pass the puck. But even Joel Quenneville wants him to have a shoot-first mentality right now.\n“First and foremost, I’ve got to get to the areas where I’m going to get to shoot, and once I do get there, like you said, be selfish and shoot the puck,” Toews said. “Whether it goes in or not, we’re always going to generate chances and further possession off of shots. That’s what I need to be thinking — going out there and using that shot and making myself dangerous as a result of that. You kind of open up other options, too, when guys will be jumping on you thinking you’re a threat to shoot the puck all the time.”\nThere’s no panic in guys like Toews and Hossa. They’ve broken out of enough scoring slumps to know that, eventually, the goals will come. But the difference between feeling frustrated and feeling confident is a big one, even for the most accomplished of players.\n“All of a sudden, then you start feeling it,” Hossa said. “The game is easier, you get more confidence on the puck, you’re skating lighter and you make things happen around you.”\nNOTE: As expected, Bryan Bickell will be a healthy scratch tonight against the Panthers. Quenneville had a brief chat with Bickell toward the end of the morning skate.\n“I told him I didn’t mind how he was playing, but his last game was ordinary,” Quenneville said. “We’ve got some other guys who could come out as well, and have come out as well. You have to do what you can to get yourself back in there and get quality ice time.”\nEmail: mlazerus@suntimes.com\nTwitter: @marklazerus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:46:21.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
