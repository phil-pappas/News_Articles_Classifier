Thus, a player whose banishment from baseball is being reviewed by the current commissioner (Rob Manfred) and a player banned for 2014 by the previous commissioner (Bud Selig) will be on the same set discussing baseball’s biggest games.\nMLB did not have veto power to prevent this, but was given a heads-up by the network and did not fight it. MLB was pleased with Rodriguez’s comportment this season.\nRodriguez and Rose will join host Kevin Burkhardt and Frank Thomas, Raul Ibanez and Max Scherzer in the studio.\nLike Rose, Rodriguez has a deep affinity and knowledge of the sport. However, he has not always been graceful when having to speak off the cuff.\nRodriguez was suspended for the entire 2014 season for his involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs.\nHe returned to the Yankees this season and became one of their most important players and leaders on a wild-card team. Despite struggling down the stretch, he finished with 33 homers and was acknowledged by others in the clubhouse for bringing knowledge and calm to the Yankees.\n  alex rodriguez ,  mlb playoffs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:50:02.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
