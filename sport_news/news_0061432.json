About three hours after the 1-1 draw at Goodison Park, Rodgers had his contract terminated.\n\"All of us have experienced some wonderful moments with Brendan as manager and we are confident he will enjoy a long career in the game,\" the FSG’s ownership group said.\n\"Although this has been a difficult decision, we believe it provides us with the best opportunity for success on the pitch. Ambition and winning are at the heart of what we want to bring to Liverpool and we believe this change gives us the best opportunity to deliver it.\" \nLiverpool said the search for Rodgers’ replacement was underway, with much of the media speculation centering on Juergen Klopp, who is on a break after leaving German side Borussia Dortmund at the end of last season.\nThe timing of the announcement caught many by surprise, but the upcoming international break means Liverpool’s next league game isn’t until Oct. 17 — at Tottenham — giving the club two weeks to hire a replacement. \nLiverpool is in 10th place in the Premier League after winning three of its first eight games. \nARSENAL BLANKS UNITED: Alexis Sanchez scored twice in the first half, leading Arsenal to a 3-0 win over Manchester United in a dominant display that propelled the London club into second place in the Premier League.\nArsenal decided the game in the opening 20 minutes after a furious start at the Emirates. Sanchez’s backheel-flick at the near post opened the scoring in the sixth minute, and Mesut Ozil doubled the lead a minute later when he coolly curled the ball home after being set up by Theo Walcott.\nSanchez’s second was a fierce shot from the edge of the area in the 20th. It was Sanchez’s fifth goal in two league matches after his hat trick against Leicester last week. \nThe Gunners leapfrogged United into second place with 16 points, two behind leading Manchester City.\nUnited is just behind Arsenal on goal difference.\nUnited entered the weekend as the league leader but couldn’t cope with Arsenal’s quick passing and high tempo as the Gunners looked like a completely different team to the one that lost, 3-2, to Olympiakos at home in the Champions League in midweek. \nBAYERN ROLLS: Robert Lewandowski scored twice as Bayern Munich routed previously unbeaten Borussia Dortmund, 5-1, to open up a seven-point lead after eight Bundesliga matches.\nBLATTER’S DAUGHTER UPSET: Sepp Blatter’s daughter said media envy and hatred is to blame for the FIFA president’s reputation being ruined and it will take \"several people to do the job in the future.\"\nDaughter Corinne Blatter Andenmatten was quoted by Swiss newspaper Blick that her father’s interrogation by Swiss investigators on Sept. 25 lasted eight hours. She feared \"they would take him away in handcuffs.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:44:52.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
