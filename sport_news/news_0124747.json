Suddenly, senior quarterback Connor Cook's eyes started looking more toward Paul Lang and Jamal Lyles.\nThe two backup tight ends came through with two critical catches late in MSU's 30-10 win over Central Michigan last week. In large part, it's because the Spartans feel like they have three starters at the position.\n\"I think we have a lot of depth at the tight end spot, which is good,\" Cook said. \"They get first downs. They're possession guys. They're big targets, they're big, strong guys. When you get a big enough target with Josiah Price or Jamal Lyles and Paul Lang, it's kind of a mismatch on a linebacker.\"\nTight ends are often called a quarterback's best friend because of their abilities to both block and catch the ball. Price and Connor Cook have become well-acquainted the past few years, becoming the Spartans' top touchdown connection.\nBut like elsewhere across MSU's roster, injuries are testing the depth at that position after Price left last week's win with the ankle issue. His status for Saturday is uncertain.\nAll three continue to be listed as co-starters on the Spartans' depth chart, with senior Lang having started the first three games and junior Lyles getting the nod last week. MSU coach Mark Dantonio said those three have averaged a little more than 30 snaps per game apiece.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMSU notes: Dennis Finley ready for chance to fill in at LT\n\"It's really important for us, especially just for Connor to know we're always there when he needs us,\" Lang said. \"We want him to have confidence in us to open up the passing game overall, especially for those young receivers.\"\nPrice remains the star of the group in terms of numbers as a receiver. Four of the 6-foot-4, 252-pound junior's catches have gone for touchdowns this season, one in each game, and his 92 receiving yards rank third on the team. Price also set the school record for career TD catches by a tight end with his 14th and has 50 catches for 676 yards in his three seasons alongside Cook.\n\"Josiah's a big target. He's got great hands, and he runs great routes,\" Cook said. \"He's a smart guy and knows how to get open. Having a guy like that, it's fun to throw to him — a guy that can bail you out if you don't throw him the best ball, and he can make a good catch.\"\nLyles last week broke open for a 26-yard catch from Cook early in the fourth quarter to help move the Spartans into CMU territory and set up Gerald Holmes' touchdown run. The 6-3, 263-pound converted defensive end now has 12 career receptions for 176 yards, showing the ability and athleticism to work downfield in the passing game. His two catches this year have totaled 44 yards.\nOn MSU's next drive after a turnover, Lang converted a third-and-short with a 9-yard reception from Cook. That kept the drive moving for Holmes' second scoring run to put the game away. Lang now has six grabs for 19 yards and a TD in his career, but the 6-5, 260-pounder has been more the blocking force of the three tight ends.\n\"We all have certain situations that they are probably better at and they are used in all the situations,\" Dantonio said. \"I think Josiah is the guy that's getting most of the catches for touchdowns, etc., but Lyles and Paul both have that ability. You can really go five deep there, because I think we have two other tight ends in (Matt) Sokol and (Dylan) Chmura that are good players, as well, or will be.\"\nShould starting left tackle Jack Conklin be out for an extended period of time, the tight ends' already important blocking responsibilities on the edge could expand to help Conklin's expected replacement, sophomore Dennis Finley, develop into his new role.\nThey're also vital for Cook's ability to stretch the field vertically, both along the line by keeping him upright and in stretching out opposing linebackers in pass coverage to open up more room for wide receivers to run their routes.\n\"I'd say we all feel comfortable with whatever is asked,\" Lang said. \"We've all been taught and learned everything, both run and pass. I feel like all five tight ends we have here are comfortable both running routes and blocking. But our main focus is blocking, because that blocking opens up our passing game.\"\nCome back Saturday for a live blog of the MSU-Purdue game.
