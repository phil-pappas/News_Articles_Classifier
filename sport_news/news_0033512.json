The Red Devils will lock up with No. 2 ranked North Central today. The Panthers upset No. 1 Carmel to advance to the semifinal round. \nJeff and North Central are the state’s only two unbeaten teams. \nCulver took an early lead after last years state runner-up Sam Concannon beat Jeff’s Brock Winchell, 6-1, 6-0 to be the first off the court. \n“I felt Brock was very competitive, even though the score did not reflect how well he played,” Jeffersonville coach Mark Reilly said. “[Concannon] is still undefeated and played like a state champion.” \nJeffersonville responded by wining the next three matches. \nBradley Cross was the first Red Devil off the court. He got Jeffersonville started with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Joshua Thompkins in No. 3 singles. \nThe Red Devils’s No. 2 doubles team of Keith Asplund and Blake Winchell were the next off after beating Culver’s Evan Dillion and Ean Anderson 6-2, 6-3. \nThe clinching point came when Jeff’s No.1 doubles team of Jack Reilly and Sam Coward defeated the Culver duo of Brian Tao and William Billcic 6-2, 6-3. \n“Our crafty lefty, Sam, used the wind to make his serve highly effective,” Coach Reilly said. “Jack’s big forehand and kick serve provided a lot of easy points for put-away shots for Sam at the net.” \nKooper Falkenstein saw his perfect season come to an end at the hands of Culvers’ Chris Bilicic 0-6, 6-4, 6-1. Falkenstein has had an amazing year and has been the constant for Jeff all year in the No. 2 spot. \n“He had such a big smile when the players went out on the court to celebrate, Reilly said of Falkenstein. “True character comes out after a defeat and Jeffersonville has a class act with Falkenstein on the court.” \nJEFFERSONVILLE 3, CULVER ACADEMIES 2 \nAt Indianapolis \nSingles: Sam Concannon (C) d.
