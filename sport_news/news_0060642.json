It was American Pharoah's fifth drill since returning to his home base last month and was in stark contrast to his leisurely five-furlong work of 1:01.20 last week. \nBaffert said he wanted to get a strong work out of American Pharoah and he handled it well. Stablemate Madam Aamoura provided a target for the colt, who started about seven lengths behind her before charging past the filly. \nBaffert has indicated American Pharoah could be sent to Kentucky around Oct. 25 or a couple days later. The colt is set to run in the $5 million Classic before being retired to stud duty.
