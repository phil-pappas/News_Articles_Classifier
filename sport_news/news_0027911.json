And I’m sure that however it turns out, that this is a group of players that will play as hard as they can play for each other. Obviously we would have loved to have done it right here in our house. Well, that’s not the case. We’re going to have to go do it in another location, and we’re going to play a baseball game.”\nRangers give Cole Hamels ball for Game 5 of ALDS\nBy Mike Rutsey , Toronto Sun First posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 09:06 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 12, 2015 09:10 PM EDT\nIn Game 5 for all the marbles, the Texas Rangers will go with left-hander Cole Hamels.\nHamels was the Rangers Game 2 starter who ended with a no-decision in a game Texas won 6-4 in 14 innings.
