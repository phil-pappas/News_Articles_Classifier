I'm usually having to make dinner and it can be tough those nights because Jaxon, especially, needs a lot of attention. I'm usually holding him on one hip while I'm trying to cook.\"\nJaxon, who is about 17 months old, is the couple's younger son. Their oldest son, Camden, 3, has picked up some bad habits from his parents: Tackling and swearing, Cavallari said.\n\"He’s really into (football) now and he tackles Jaxon — which is not good — but I've been taking him to the games and he's been having a lot of fun,\" said Cavallari, a reality star turned shoe designer. Cutler, 32, injured his hamstring in the Arizona Cardinals game last month trying to make a tackle after an interception.\nCavallari said Camden has picked up swearing from her.\n\"Camden said the f-word once. He said it like, 'Mommy, why did you say f---?' so he didn't just say it for no reason. It really makes you catch yourself and make you be aware of what you’re saying all the time.\"\nThe couple's third child, a girl, is due in November. Cavallari said in a recent inteview that her daughter's name was inspired by a woman's dog but she did not reveal the name in the interview.\nPhotos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler.\n Kristin Cavallari Jay Cutler Chicago Bears Arizona Cardinals", "external_links": ["http://celebritybabies.people.com/2015/10/02/kristin-cavallari-football-season-motherhood-routine/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611cfa3/turbine/chi-jay-cutler-chicago-bears-photos-20140102", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612783d/turbine/ct-kristin-cavallari-jay-cutler-bears20151005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611bbb1/turbine/chi-jay-cutler-chicago-bears-photos-20140102-065", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611bbad/turbine/chi-jay-cutler-chicago-bears-photos-20140102-067"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:03:12.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
