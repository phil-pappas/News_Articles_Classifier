But we missed way too many serves and made hitting errors.” Hunter Scott led the Burros offensively with 14 kills, and Tinoi Martin added nine. Defensively, libero Morgan Jones had 18 digs, and Rachel Fortney had two blocks. Burroughs will next visit Oak Hills for the second of two matches between the schools. The Burros swept the last contest on Sept. 30. “We’re planning to work on the same thing we’ve been working on:blocking,”Beckstrom said. “As we get to other teams, we’ll have to be able to throw down the ball.” The Burros’ next home game is on Oct. 26 against Apple Valley.
