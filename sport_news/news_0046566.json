At the time, Netflix said existing customers wouldn't see a bill increase for two years.\nOn Thursday, Netflix said standard-plan customers not already grandfathered into a lower price will continue to pay $8.99 until October 2016.\nThe company would not say whether the standard plan is Netflix's most popular in Canada.\n\"To continue adding more TV shows and movies including many Netflix original titles, we are modestly raising the price for some new members in the U.S., Canada and Latin America,\" the company said in a statement.\nIn a telephone poll of 4,002 anglophone Canadians conducted for the Media Technology Monitor last fall, 39 per cent said they had access to a Netflix subscription, up from 26 per cent in 2013.\nMTM also found that 82 per cent of Netflix subscribers said they used the streaming service every week.\nThe results are considered accurate within 1.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:15:07.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
