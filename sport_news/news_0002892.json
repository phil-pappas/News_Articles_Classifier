(Baltimore Sun) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Terps interim coach Mike Locksley said Shane Cockerille's move back to quarterback boosts depth. \nOver the summer, redshirt sophomore Shane Cockerille approached former Maryland coach Randy Edsall about switching positions from quarterback in order to get on the field and contribute . In the past week, interim coach Mike Locksley asked Cockerille to switch from fullback back to quarterback to help give the team better depth behind starter Perry Hills. \nWith third-string quarterback Daxx Garman “a little banged up,” Cockerille’s second position switch in a matter of months gives Maryland insurance at a position it’s struggled to find consistency at this season. \n“When you look at the hits that Perry took in the Ohio State game, I don't think that his mom will be really happy if we continue to let him get beat up like that,” Locksley said Tuesday. “So [we’re] moving a guy that has the similar skill set like Shane does.” \nAgainst Ohio State, Maryland installed a game plan tailored to Hills’ strengths that included an emphasis on the quarterback running the ball. Hills gained a Maryland quarterback record 170 yards and scored twice on the ground in a 49-28 loss. But he took some big hits against the Buckeyes, and with Locksley planning to keep a similar offense moving forward, Cockerille’s switch allows the Terps to keep a similar offense is something happens to Hills. \nGarman and Caleb Rowe, who is listed as a co-backup with Cockerille , are more traditional dropback passers with less mobility. Cockerille was a three-star recruit out of Gilman who was rated as the No. 16 dual threat quarterback in the Class of 2013 by Rivals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:06:14.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
