Sharma scored again with 18:19 left in the game off a pass from Rocco Coulibaly to increase the lead to 2-0. \n\"The second goal was a great team goal,\" Sharma said. \"We must have passed it six or seven times in a row, all one touch, and just ended with the finish.\" \nConnor Bayne headed in a free kick from Nick Steed with 15:09 left to increase the lead to 3-0. Steed came back four minutes later with a goal on a penalty kick after a tripping call in the box, and Coulibaly scored the final goal off a Michael Woglom assist with 2:33 to go. \nNotre Dame (15-0) has now outscored its opponents 141-3 this season and is ranked third in Class C by the New York State Sportswriters Association. Lansing, ranked fifth in the state in Class C, dropped to 14-1-1. \n\"We knew it was going to be tough coming in,\" Sharma said. \"We were ready to go. We came out hot, and it showed on the scoreboard.\" \nLast year, Notre Dame was a 3-2 winner over Lansing in the Large School title game. The Bobcats beat the Crusaders each of the previous three seasons in the final. \nNotre Dame's closest game before Saturday was 4-0 over Waverly. The Crusaders have reached 10 goals in a game eight times. \n\"Lansing did a really good job trying to press us and knock us off our rhythm,\" Crusaders head coach Brian Adams said. \"That's something we try to do to other teams. I talked to everyone in the second half about just trying to be a little more creative, trying to be a little less predictable, and just play quicker, because that's what's going to beat a press like that any time. We started a little slow in the second half, but once things got rolling, they looked really, really good.\" \nLansing was able to get off only three shots against the Crusaders. Notre Dame goalie Will Brennan was called on to make just a single save. \n\"I thought at halftime we were in a good place, 1-0,\" Lansing head coach Adam Heck said. \"When you chase a lot, you're going to get tired, and I think we wore down and the third, fourth, fifth goal, really, we had to press, and it is what it is. I thought at halftime if we could have got the next goal, we would have been in a good spot, put them under a situation they hadn't been in.\" \nSaid Adams: \"When you spend a lot of time chasing, you will get tired. We spend a lot of time conditioning, so that allowed me to keep my starting 11 in there almost 100 percent of the minutes.\" \nThe teams could see each other again in the Section 4 Class C tournament. Top-seeded Notre Dame plays either Unatego or Spencer-Van Etten in a quarterfinal at 3:30 p.m. Oct. 24 at home, while No. 2 Lansing hosts either Marathon or Odessa-Montour at the same time. \n\"I'm excited for them,\" Adams said of his team winning the conference title. \"It's all business in there. When we got done, all they were talking about was, 'OK, onto the next game.'\" \nOn Twitter: @SGAndrewLegare 17 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://stargaz.tt/1LBmD6L TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:07:48.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
