The Patriots back has not only been a big hit with the Patriots, but on fantasy teams, too.AP Photo Posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 2:00 am \nHere's a quick rundown of the weekend's games and thoughts on each: \nSunday, 1 p.m. \nChicago @ Detroit: Alshon Jeffery should finally return this week as a WR2 for Jay Cutler. Keep on riding the consistently reliable Matt Forte as an elite RB1. Martellus Bennett remains a mid-range TE1. Disappointing Matthew Stafford is on shaky ground as the starter for Detroit, let alone fantasy teams. Calvin Johnson is still a WR2, but ignorable in DFS formats. Ameer Abdullah is a decent \"flex\" play, but Theo Riddick cuts into his upside out of the backfield. \nWashington @ New York Jets: A great matchup for Ryan Fitzpatrick & Co. elevates Brandon Marshall to mid-range WR1 status, while Eric Decker is a WR2/3. The running game goes through rock solid RB2 Chris Ivory. Matt Jones and Alfred Morris remain uninspiring RB3s for Washington. DeSean Jackson still appears a week away with a hamstring, resulting in Pierre Garcon being their only relevant pass-catcher as a WR3. \nArizona @ Pittsburgh: Ben Roethlisberger is on the verge of returning, which would boost his entire offense. Borderline WR1/2 Antonio Brown would resume elite WR1 status with Ben under center. Le’Veon Bell is a top-three RB regardless. Carson Palmer should have a field day against Pittsburgh’s talent-deficient defense. They simply don’t have the horses to stop WR1 Larry Fitzgerald and resurgent RB2 Chris Johnson. \nKansas City @ Minnesota: Jamaal Charles’ season-ending injury will certainly be felt, but Charcandrick West is the top beneficiary as an immediate RB2. Expect Jeremy Maclin and Travis Kelce to pick up some slack in the passing game as well. Adrian Peterson is matchup-proof against Kansas City’s tough defense. It’s tough to trust Mike Wallace as more than a WR3 until Teddy Bridgewater begins the sophomore leap many were expecting. \nCincinnati @ Buffalo: QB1 Tyrod Taylor is highly questionable with an ankle ailment, but it’s hard to trust any of Buffalo’s pass-catchers regardless. LeSean McCoy is still sidelined with a hamstring, while Karlos Williams has a concussion of his own, making Buffalo players tough to rely on. Andy Dalton is playing as well as anyone in the league, elevating A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert as elite options at WR and TE. Giovani Bernard’s pass-catching role makes him a solid RB2, while Jeremy Hill is just a touchdown-dependent RB3. \nDenver @ Cleveland: The story remains the same for noodle-arm Peyton Manning, who is being carried by his WR1 duo of Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders. Offseason darling C.J. Anderson is untrustable in a time-share with the more talented Ronnie Hillman. Gary Barnidge’s 16 targets over the last two weeks make him an intriguing dart throw at TE, while Duke Johnson has emerged as a solid RB2 in an offense starving for playmakers. \nMiami @ Tennessee: A coaching shakeup may lead to a newfound reliance on Lamar Miller, a risky but potentially rewarding RB2. Ryan Tannehill’s favorite possession option, Jarvis Landry is a WR2 on mass of targets alone. There are worse WR3s than Kendall Wright, but with only 16 catches on the year, he’s not as consistent as often assumed. Delanie Walker remains a low-end TE1 as a reliable red zone option for Marcus Mariota. \nHouston @ Jacksonville: The relative stability of Brian Hoyer keeps DeAndre Hopkins afloat as an elite WR1 without any relevant pass-catchers behind him. RB1 Arian Foster’s ten targets last week show that Houston is ready to ride him into the ground even at significantly less than 100 [percent. Allen Robinson is locked in as a target-heavy WR2 under impressive sophomore Blake Bortles. Bellcow T.J. Yeldon is banged up with a groin injury, but should carry value as an RB2. \nSunday, 4:05-4:25 p.m. \nCarolina @ Seattle: Marshawn Lynch returns for what should be a fantasy-adverse defensive struggle, but resumes RB1 status. Jimmy Graham is just a complementary option in Russell Wilson’s low-volume passing attack. A brutal matchup for Jonathan Stewart renders him no more than a RB3/Flex. Greg Olsen is a decent TE1 as Cam Newton’s sole reliable pass-catcher, but yards will be hard to come by for Carolina. \nSan Diego @ Green Bay: RB2 Danny Woodhead is the preferred option over Melvin Gordon in a game in which San Diego is likely to play from behind. Antonio Gates’ impressive return makes him an immediate top-five TE1, while Keenan Allen remains a solid WR2. Randall Cobb should bounce back after last week’s 28-yard effort as a top-five WR1. This is the perfect week for Eddie Lacy’s frustrating season to get back on track as an elite RB1 against San Diego’s soft defense. \nBaltimore @ San Francisco: A battle of talent-deficient offenses should result in an avoidable matchup for fantasy purposes. Colin Kaepernick’s favorite target, Anquan Boldin is a middling WR3 against his former team. Fire up Carlos Hyde as an opportunity-based RB1/2. Baltimore’s offense goes through RB2 Justin Forsett, who should play through his ankle injury after two straight 100-yard performances. Steve Smith is questionable to return as a banged-up WR2. \nSunday, 8:30 p.m. \nNew England @ Indianapolis: Explosive in space, Dion Lewis has emerged as an every-week RB1 for the best offense in football. Top TE Rob Gronkowski should return to the end zone after two straight games without a touchdown, while Julian Edelman is an easy WR1 in a game where Tom Brady may pass 50 times. Andrew Luck’s return opens up the offense for WR1 T.Y. Hilton, as well as intriguing WR2 Donte Moncrief. Frank Gore is a middling RB2 in a game that will be decided through the air. \nMonday night \nNew York Giants @ Philadelphia: QB1 Eli Manning is playing the best football of his career, elevating the abilities of those around him. Alpha WR1 Odell Beckham is questionable with a hamstring injury, but should play at less than 100 percent. Pass-catching option Shane Vereen is the top beneficiary as an RB2 if Beckham and Rueben Randle aren’t at top form. DeMarco Murray has settled in as a middling RB2 for a resurging offense. Jordan Matthews’ recent string of down games has dropped his value to WR2 until he resumes his usual target load.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:43:54.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
