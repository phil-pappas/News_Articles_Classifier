It’s not our practice to respond to rumors, but I thought it was important to let you know that we’ve done our due diligence and Dave Hart and I are very confident there was no inappropriate conduct with any players or coaches.\" \nThe Vols are 0-2 in the SEC with Georgia coming to town this weekend.
