And now that the Mets lead the Chicago Cubs 2-0 in the series, Bukiet says they are heavily favored to make the World Series.\nBukiet has issued predictions for each of the remaining five games in the series, largely based on the starting pitchers. For tonight’s third game in Chicago, the Mets have a 53 percent chance of winning, he says. For the next three games the Cubs have a slight statistical edge. But if it comes down to a final game seven, the Mets have a big advantage.\nIn game four, the Mets have a 44 percent chance against the Cubs.\nIn game five, the Mets have a 49 percent of winning.\nIn game six, the Mets have a 41 percent chance of winning.\nAnd in game seven, the Mets have a 61 percent chance of beating the Cubs.\n“It looks good for the Mets to win the National League,” says Bukiet. “I’ve been a Mets fan for 50 years and hope they win it all. After the championships I’ll review the numbers and make my predictions for the World Series.”\nBukiet updates his website often, where he provides the likelihood of each team taking the series. The numbers are revised as the probabilities change with the progression of each series.\nDuring the season Bukiet applies his model to determine whether it is worthwhile to wager on games. His picks have led to positive results for 9 of the 15 years he has been studying baseball.\nHis method uses a Markov process approach, which he originally published in the journal Operations Research. The method enables one to assess prospective trades and evaluate who should win the Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Awards.\nAbout NJIT\nOne of the nation’s leading public technological universities, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is a top-tier research university that prepares students to become leaders in the technology-dependent economy of the 21st century.
