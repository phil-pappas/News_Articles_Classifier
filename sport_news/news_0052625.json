Once the first one goes in, it seems like we play with more confidence. We know we can put balls in the back of the net, but we just had to start executing better.\" \nThe execution led to another showdown with IHA with a county championship on the line. Highlands says it has moved on from last year’s 1-0 defeat to the Blue Eagles that snapped its 88-game unbeaten streak — and the results have indicated as much — but many of the players who experienced last year’s streak-stopping heartbreaker will be taking the field again Saturday. \nThe frustration now long dissipated as the sun set at River Dell on Sunday, Madigan spoke eagerly about the upcoming opportunity. \n\"We’re excited to be going back,\" she said. \"We’ve got a lot of seniors in our group and it’s great for them. If the crowd and atmosphere are anything like last year, it will be a fantastic setup. We’re looking forward to it.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:45:20.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
