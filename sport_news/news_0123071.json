A waggish, impish moment? And during a debate yet?\nStanding onstage for two hours can test the mettle of the presidential candidates. And it also tests their kidneys — which is why when CNN cut away for commercials Tuesday night, the candidates rushed offstage and headed for the bathrooms.\nBut Clinton barely made it back on time after one break.\n“Secretary Clinton, welcome back,” CNN moderator Anderson Cooper said, looking as relieved as Clinton did.\n“Well, thank you,” Hillary replied. “You know, it does take me a little longer. That’s all I can say.”\nThe audience roared. Or at least the women in the audience did. They got the joke. And the men were then empowered to laugh along with them.\nOPINION\nFollow @politicoroger\nAnd for one highly unexpected moment, a whole bunch of people were laughing.\nWhy is this important? Or even noteworthy?\nBecause Hillary Clinton showed something she rarely shows in public: her human side.\nIn fact, she did more. She actually showed she could be human.\nThis is not a small thing for Clinton. She is bright, experienced, prepared. But she is often robotic — which is the opposite of human.\nShe is so used to being a target — having been one for so many years — and this has made her very, very cautious. Guarded, wary, even paranoid. Which is what the whole email thing is about. She was going to keep her emails private no matter what!\nThat one hasn’t worked out so well.\nBeing the brightest kid in the class has limits. Her husband always had to be the brightest kid. And he wanted everybody to know it. But he also had his aw-shucks, down-home, country-boy side, which was designed to humanize him.\nIn 2008, Hillary’s campaign found it almost impossible to humanize her (except for that famous choked-up moment in New Hampshire, which she refused to repeat).\nThis time around has only been slightly better. She went on “Saturday Night Live” and read some lines that somebody wrote for her.\nBut how would she show human and not be a robot in the very first Democratic debate, in a 50,000-square-foot ballroom at the Wynn resort and casino in front of an audience of more than 1,200, which could intimidate anyone?\nHuman is risky. Robot is not. Unless you have something to prove this time around.\nThat she would do well against the Democratic field is not to denigrate the field. Compared with the Republican clown car, the Democrats look like masterminds (well, maybe excepting Lincoln Chafee).\nAnd Bernie Sanders was prepared to do battle. The first sign was that he had actually combed his hair, which was a new thing for him. Personal grooming is not Sanders’ strong point.\nBut it was Clinton who turned the tables on Sanders early on, when she attacked him on gun control. “Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill,” Clinton said.\nAnd from that moment on, she really had no opponents other than herself.\nThe others had some good lines.\nMartin O’Malley called Donald Trump a “carnival barker” and said, contrasting the Democratic debate with the two Republican ones: “On this stage, you didn’t hear anyone denigrate women. You didn’t hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants. You didn’t hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief.”\nAnd Clinton did occasionally try to cut corners. When asked how her presidency would be different from an Obama third term, she said: “Well, I think that’s pretty obvious. I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we’ve had up until this point.”\nThat got a big whoop from the audience, but it was not a real answer, and Anderson Cooper did not let her get away with it.\n“Is there a policy difference?” he asked.\nAnd she somewhat weakly mentioned prescription drugs and financing education.\nBut it was a debate she knew she had won. Hit the issues. Showed the human.\nSo she relaxed and reverted to form in her closing statement.\n“Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people?” she said.\nBut this is not vision. It does not inspire. It does not uplift. It is merely safe.\nSo Clinton still needs the vision thing. But one debate at a time.\nFollow Roger Simon on Twitter: Follow @politicoroger\nTweets by @politicoroger", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/politicoroger"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:16:14.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
