Both Jerry and Stephen Jones have insisted it was a realistic return date, although, it would be well ahead of his timetable. NFL.com's Ian Rapoport reports Bryant is \"incredibly unlikely\" to play Week 7. He went on to add that he \"may not even be practicing yet.\"\nFANTASY ANALYSIS\nSorry Bryant owners. Of course I feel like the bearer of bad news. Don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you. It appears he still may be a ways away. His injury was a back-breaker for fantasy owners. However, look at it this way, if you can survive this long without him, imagine how strong your team will be once he returns. That's a glass is a quarter full outlook, nonetheless, you'll just have to make due for the time being. He should be considered week to week at this point.\nSource: Ian Rapoport via Twitter\nJoin the discussion by visiting our forum!\nSign up for SCOUT Fantasy today and get expert advice for your big Fantasy draft!\nPlay in a ScoutFantasy League today and get ranked!\nDrafts are filling every night.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.scout.com/fantasy/forums/5397-fantasy-talk", "https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/656249159691993088", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.scout.com/", "https://secure.scout.com/a.z?s=532&p=12"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:31:27.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
