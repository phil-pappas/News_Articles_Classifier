(AP) -- Argentina's Emiliano Grillo made a 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole Sunday to win the Web.com Tour Finals-ending Web.Com Tour Championship, and Rob Oppenheim got the last PGA Tour card when Lucas Glover shook up the order with a closing bogey.\nAdChoices The 23-year-old Grillo beat Chez Reavie by a stroke in the last of the four events that replaced PGA Tour qualifying school, finishing with a 1-under 69 for a 14-under 266 total on the Dye's Valley Course at TPC Sawgrass.\n\"I gave my best out there, and I think the best thing I did all day was making that putt on 18,\" Grillo said. \"It's been a great week. I'm on the PGA Tour and it feels great.\"\nReavie had a chance to force a playoff, but missed a 15-foot birdie putt. He shot a 68.\nThe series featured the top 75 players from the Web.com Tour money list, Nos. 126-200 in the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup standings and non-members such as Grillo who earned enough money to have placed in the top 200 had they been eligible. The top 25 players on the Web.com Tour regular-season money list earned PGA Tour cards. They were competing against each other for tour priority, with regular-season earnings counting in their totals. The other players were competing for 25 cards based on series earnings.\nGrillo earned $180,000 for the victory to finish second on the series money list with $283,667. Reavie, the winner in North Carolina in the second event in the series, made $108,000 to top the list with $323,067.\nOppenheim took the 25th and final card with $32,206, edging Eric Axley by $101. Oppenheim finished with a 67 to tie for seventh at 7 under and earn $19,000. Glover's bogey on the final hole dropped the 2009 U.S. Open winner from a three-way tie for 10th into a five-way tie for 12th, giving Oppenheim an extra $800. Axley, 25th last year by $31.66, missed the cut.\nGlover earned a card with a 14th-place finish on the series list.\nReavie and Patton Kizzire, the Web.com Tour's combined money leader with $518,241, earned full tour exemptions and spots in the Players Championship. Reavie, the 2008 Canadian Open winner, finished 166th in the FedEx Cup.\n\"It's everything,\" Reavie said about becoming fully exempt. \"A couple of years ago I was hurt and didn't know where was going to end up and here I am playing the best golf of my life and I've got a spot back on tour.\"\nKizzire closed with a 67 to tie for fifth at 10 under.\n\"It's hard to believe,\" Kizzire said. \"I've always believed in myself, but it's hard to believe that I came out on top. I don't like to think about what I've done, I just like to keep going and try to do better.\"\nSam Saunders was third at 12 under after a 67. Saunders, Arnold Palmer's grandson, was sixth on the series list with $114,950 after finishing 137th in the FedEx Cup. Rhein Gibson was another stroke back after a 65. He was 10th on the series list after finishing 33rd on the Web.com Tour regular-season money list.\nKyle Stanley (68) and South Africans Thomas Aiken (65) and Tyrone Van Aswegen (68) also tied for fifth. Stanley was 11th on the series list, Van Aswegen 17th, and Aiken 23rd.\nHenrik Norlander was third on the money list with $215,743, followed by Andrew Loupe at $195,405. Norlander won the series opener in Indiana, and Loupe won last week in Ohio.\nRoberto Castro also earned a card along with Michael Thompson, Tom Hoge, Brett Stegmaier, Hiroshi Iwata, Ricky Barnes, Derek Fathauer, Anirban Lahiri, Mark Hubbard, Robert Garrigus, Tim Wilkinson Derek Ernst, Luke List and Brian Davis. Castro matched the course with a 62 to tie for 10th at 8 under.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf6kyJ.img&quot;}}", "http://ap.org/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Grillo", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf4JQ5.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeRtnW.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;With", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeRtXe.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAdga9B&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Jordan", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;golf&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&q"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:55:00.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
