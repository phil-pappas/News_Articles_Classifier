Watson variety show. \nSpecial guests include a powerful offensive line, determined backfield mates, a stingy defense and rock-solid special teams. \nOn a cool, overcast Saturday afternoon, Chenango Forks junior Watson lined up under center, in the backfield, out wide, and as a safety, a kick returner and a punter. Rival Chenango Valley saw far too much of the Blue Devils standout. \nWatson scored three touchdowns over the final 8 minutes, 57 seconds of the second quarter to lead Forks to a 43-27 Section 4 Football Conference non-division victory over visiting CV. \nIt marked Forks' 22nd successive victory over its neighbors and this one wasn't nearly as close as the score indicates. \nWith 8:16 to go in the third quarter, the hosts held a 43-7 lead, showing no rust from a two-week layoff that included a forfeit win over Lansing last week. \nBy halftime, Watson carried 14 times for 154 yards. He amassed 132 yards on his final five attempts of the half, the last a highlight-reel, 46-yard scoring run 28 seconds before intermission. \nDuring that highly-impressive stretch, the 33 on his jersey could just as well have read: Hazardous material, keep away. \nThe really good stuff for Forks came after Watson switched from quarterback to halfback. Tony Silvanic took over at quarterback in the second quarter, when yards and points started coming in bunches. \n\"We started mixing it up and playing me at halftime and I didn't think they were ready for it at all,\" said Watson, who played running back last season before switching to quarterback this season. \nWatson's last possession at QB resulted in the game's first touchdown. Forks drove 50 yards 50 yards in 10 plays, the big play an 11-yard run by Tim McDonald on third-and-9. McDonald took a toss left and made it to the sideline before being forced out at the 28. \nOn the next play, Watson rolled left on a designed pass, didn't like what he saw, tucked it, reversed field and gained 10 yards, and a tripping penalty moved the ball to CV's 7. Two plays later, McDonald ran off the left side, scoring on a 4-yard run and Silvanic's PAT made it 7-0, with 21 seconds left in the opening quarter. \nFollowing the Warriors' third straight three-and-out to start the game, Watson returned a 40-yard punt by Nick Pert 30 yards to CV's 16. Three plays later and now in the backfield, Watson took a pitch right, made a sharp cut, broke a tackle and scored from 13 yards. McDonald's two-point run made it 15-0 with 8:57 remaining in the half. \nRyan Ehrets recovered a CV fumble on the ensuing possession and Forks took over at its 31. A 22-yard run on a sweep left by Watson, aided by a downfield block from Dylan Studer, moved the ball to CV's 43. Five plays later, Watson took a toss left, narrowly avoided a tackle attempt in the backfield, cut it up and then to the right and finally into the end zone from 21 yards. Silvanic tacked on the extra point for a 22-0 Blue Devils lead. \n\"They have a lot of good running backs, especially the Watson kid,\" CV coach Jay Hope said. \"He doesn't need much to make you miss and he has another gear that can take it the whole way.\" \nCV (5-4) finally answered. Quarterback Mark Mullins found Chris Vegiard on a long crossing route, a pass that just avoided defensive back Cody Lamond on the left side. Vegiard continued on for a 70-yard scoring play and Pert's PAT drew the Warriors to 22-7, 1:25 before halftime. \nAs Mullins and Matt Slezak dropped McDonald for losses and the first two downs of the next possession, CV took timeouts after each play. But on third-and-13, McDonald swept around the left end for 14 yards. Watson ripped off a 20-yarder around the right side on the next play and Studer took a toss left for another 13 yards to CV's 46, setting up Watson's grand-finale of the half. \nHe started right in glide-mode, exploited the smallest of seams and burst through it. Once in open field, he cut it back to the left and eased into the end zone 28 seconds before halftime. Silvanic's PAT extended the lead to 29-7. \n\"It was going to be a good play anyway, but he turns a long play into a touchdown,\" Forks coach Dave Hogan of Watson, who finished with 158 yards on 15 carries. \nThe Blue Devils (7-1) put the finishing touches on this one early in the third quarter. Studer returned the second-half kickoff 79 yards to CV's 9, setting up a 3-yard scoring run by McDonald one play later. \nCV's next possession ended in a punt that McDonald took back 41 yards to CV's 17. Studer scored from 4 yards two plays later for a 43-7 lead. \nThereafter, Mullins and Co. had their way with Forks' backups. Mullins threw three fourth-quarter scoring passes, a 7-yarder to Sam Trebilcock, and two more to Slezak that covered 67 and 14 yards. Mullins finished 13-for-22 for 266 yards and four TDs. Slezak caught seven passes for 132 yards. \nForks, which didn't attempt a pass, rushed 274 yards in the first half and 337 overall. Linemen Brandin Paulhamus, Zach Ostrander, Ehrets, Nick Hutchinson and Joseph Aldrich played a big role. \n\"They made their blocks and we made some big plays,\" Watson said. \nThis coming Saturday, Forks will host the loser of Saturday night's game between Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour and Lansing in a Class C semifinal. \nThe Warriors will get a rematch against Susquehanna Valley in a Class B semifinal this coming Saturday at home. The Sabers beat CV, 19-16, in Week 7. \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1N01HHk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:07:59.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
