First-round pairings will be released late Friday night by the IHSAA. \nAgain this year, pairings will be released after each round rather than a predetermined set of brackets. \nHere is a look at the area district races and scenarios with one game remaining: \nCLASS 4A DISTRICT 5 \nThe four qualifiers have been determined, and Kennedy (8-0, 4-0) has wrapped up the title. The rest of the order is simple if Linn-Mar (4-4, 3-1) beats Jefferson (5-3, 2-2): The Lions would be the second seed, Cedar Falls (5-3, 2-2) third and Jefferson fourth. If Jefferson wins by five points or more, the J-Hawks vault into the second spot and force the IHSAA to make a decision on first-round site assignments. \nCLASS 4A DISTRICT 6 \nWashington (7-1, 4-0) wrapped up the title with a win last week at Iowa City High. The Little Hawks (5-3, 3-1) also have a playoff berth wrapped up, and clinch home field with a win at Muscatine (6-2, 2-2). Cedar Rapids Prairie (3-5, 2-2) is a qualifier unless it loses at Ottumwa (4-4, 1-3) and Muscatine beats City High. \nCLASS 4A DISTRICT 7 \nThe champion will be determined at Pleasant Valley, where the Spartans (6-2, 3-0) host Iowa City West (3-5, 3-0). If Dubuque Hempstead (5-3, 1-2) defeats Davenport Central (1-7, 0-3), the Mustangs and Davenport North (1-7, 1-3) qualify. If not, it comes down to the 13-point rule — currently Hempstead is at minus-19, North minus-24, Central minus-35. \nCLASS 3A DISTRICT 3 \nIt’s not as tricky as it looks. West Delaware (8-0, 5-0) is the champion, Independence (7-1, 5-1) is the runner-up and Decorah (4-4, 3-2) is third. Waverly-Shell Rock (5-3, 2-3) gets the fourth slot regardless of Friday’s outcome at Charles City (3-5, 1-4) because the Go-Hawks would hold the point-differential advantage on both Charles City and the winner between Crestwood (2-6, 1-4) and Vinton-Shellsburg (2-6, 1-4). \nCLASS 3A DISTRICT 4 \nThe playoff quartet is set, led by champion Cedar Rapids Xavier (7-0, 5-0). Maquoketa (6-2, 5-1) is the runner-up, and Solon (4-4, 3-2) and Dubuque Wahlert (3-5, 3-2) play for third place at Dubuque. \nCLASS 3A DISTRICT 5 \nIt’s simple here. Washington (7-1, 5-0) goes to Brady Street Stadium on Thursday to play Davenport Assumption (6-2, 5-0) for the championship. Fairfield (4-4, 3-2) is at Clear Creek Amana (4-4, 3-2) on Friday with third place on the line. \nCLASS 3A DISTRICT 6 \nGilbert (7-1, 5-0) has wrapped up the title, with Ballard (5-3, 4-1), Bondurant-Farrar (5-3, 4-2) and Benton Community (5-3, 3-2) claiming the other three slots, in that order. \nCLASS 2A DISTRICT 3 \nThe most competitive district in 2A features a three-way tie at the top. North Fayette Valley (6-2, 4-1) holds the point-differential edge at plus-44 and claims the title if all three co-leaders win. Dyersville Beckman (5-3, 4-1) is sitting second at plus-31, Waukon (7-1, 4-1) is third at plus-27. Waukon wins the title with a win and a North Fayette Valley loss (to New Hampton); Beckman is the champion with a win and a Waukon loss (to Oelwein). New Hampton (4-4, 3-2) is the fourth-place team. \nCLASS 2A DISTRICT 4 \nAnamosa (8-0, 5-0) has the championship in hand. The winner between Mount Vernon (6-2, 4-1) and Tipton (7-1, 4-1) gains the second spot — and home-field advantage in Round 1. Cascade (4-4, 3-2) earns the fourth spot. \nCLASS 2A DISTRICT 5 \nCentral Lee (7-1, 5-1) clinched the title last week with a win over Williamsburg (5-3, 4-1), and the Raiders are the runners-up. Third place is on the line this week, when Mid-Prairie (6-2, 3-2) hosts Mediapolis (6-2, 3-2). \nCLASS 2A DISTRICT 6 \nSouth Tama (8-0, 5-0) visits Aplington-Parkersburg (7-1, 5-0) Friday with the district title on the line. Union (3-5, 3-2) has the third slot locked up, and the fourth spot will be snagged by the winner between Roland-Story (3-4, 2-3) and Iowa Falls-Alden (3-5, 2-3). \nCLASS 1A DISTRICT 4 \nThe title belongs to Dike-New Hartford (8-0, 5-0). The Wolverines are at Jesup (5-3, 3-2), which will grab the fourth spot, regardless of Friday’s outcome. South Winneshiek (6-2, 4-1) visits Hudson (7-1, 4-1), with the winner taking second place and the loser finishing third. \nCLASS 1A DISTRICT 5 \nWest Branch (8-0, 5-0) can lock up the district title if it wins at Alburnett (7-1, 4-1). The Bears also take the title in the event of a three-way tie, if Wilton (4-4, 4-1) defeats North Cedar (2-6, 2-3). Alburnett is the champion if it upsets West Branch and if North Cedar knocks off Wilton. Bellevue (4-4, 2-3) gets the fourth spot if it defeats Wapello (2-6, 0-5) and/or a Wilton win over North Cedar. \nCLASS 1A DISTRICT 6 \nLots of possibilities, and all seven teams have at least a glimmer of hope of making the postseason. Iowa City Regina (7-1, 5-0) is in the driver’s seat, and takes the title if it wins at Pella Christian (6-2, 4-1). If Pella Christian wins, the Eagles are champions if Sigourney-Keota (5-3, 4-1) loses to West Marshall (2-6, 1-4). The battle for fourth place is full of possibilities. Highland (4-4, 2-4) plays a non-disrict game with Central Lee, and the Huskies’ fate will be determined by other results within the district — West Marshall’s outcome with Sigourney-Keota, and a battle at Columbus Junction between Eddyville EBF (1-7, 1-4) and Columbus Community (2-6, 1-4). In the event of a two-way tie, Highland lost to Columbus and defeated EBF. If it’s a three-way tie, Highland’s point-differential is locked at minus-31, West Marshall is minus-32, Columbus minus-39, EBF minus-41. \nCLASS A DISTRICT 4 \nAll is determined here. Denver (7-1, 5-0) is the champion, followed in order by Gladbrook-Reinbeck (6-2, 4-1), Grundy Center (4-4, 3-2) and Ackley AGWSR (3-5, 3-3). \nCLASS A DISTRICT 5 \nMaquoketa Valley (6-2, 6-0) has successfully defended its crown. It could be murky after that: Lisbon (6-2, 5-1) is at North-Linn (4-4, 4-2), and East Buchanan (5-3, 4-2) travels to Easton Valley (3-5, 3-3). If East Buchanan wins, Easton Valley is eliminated. North-Linn could finish as high as second if it wins (and if Easton Valley wins) or could be shut out of the postseason altogether with a loss and an Easton Valley victory. The most likely scenario is Lisbon second, East Buchanan third, North-Linn fourth. \nCLASS A DISTRICT 6 \nWinfield-Mount Union (8-0, 6-0) hosts Pekin (7-1, 6-0), and the victor claims the district crown while the loser is the runner-up. Lone Tree (5-3, 4-2) has claimed a postseason berth and can virtually eliminate New London (4-4, 3-3) with a victory. If New London wins, the Tigers have a chance if WACO (3-5, 3-3) loses to Danville (2-6, 2-4). \nCLASS A DISTRICT 7 \nBGM (8-0, 6-0) has wrapped up the district title, and Colfax-Mingo (6-2, 5-1) is the runner-up. Montezuma (6-2, 4-2) is sitting good for a spot, win or lose against BGM, based on its point differential. Lynnville-Sully (5-3, 4-2) leapfrogs Montezuma for third if it beats Belle Plaine (5-3, 3-3) and Montezuma loses. Belle Plaine can push Lynnville-Sully out of the playoffs with a win by seven points or more (if Montezuma loses) or any sort of victory (if Montezuma wins). \n8-PLAYER DISTRICT 4 \nThe playoff qualifiers have been determined, and so has their order. Elkader Central (8-0, 6-0) is the champion, followed by Turkey Valley (6-2, 5-1), Midland (5-3, 4-2) and Springville (4-5, 3-3). \n8-PLAYER DISTRICT 5 \nDon Bosco (6-0, 5-0) is the champion, while the runner-up will be determined this week when Colo-Nesco (7-1, 4-1) visits HLV (7-1, 4-1). Meskwaki Settlement (4-5, 3-3) has wrapped up the fourth berth and is idle Friday. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:43:27.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
