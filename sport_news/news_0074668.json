(Sue Beyer | lehighvalleylive.com) By Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 13, 2015 1:58 AM, updated October 13, 2015 4:58 PM View/Post Comments \nEaston freshman Elessa Jacobs lost only one game in the District 11 Class AAA singles tennis tournament entering Monday's final. \nThe championship match at Lehigh University didn't go as well for Jacobs as she fell to defending champion Nina DeLuna of Southern Lehigh . \nBut the young Red Rover still has time to capture some district gold. \n\"She's got three more years to go. She's going to make an impact in this district,\" Easton coach Joe Rossi said. \nRELATED: Easton off to strong start behind freshman Elessa Jacobs \nJacobs, the daughter of former Easton basketball standout and current Phillipsburg boys basketball coach Eric Jacobs , had a 4-2 lead in the first set before DeLuna made a four-game run. \n\"She started hitting really good winners just to come back to make it 4-all and then win the set 6-4. She really kicked it up a little bit and played her best, I think,\" Jacobs said. \nThe Rover was again battling tough in the second set before DeLuna used her experience to pull away and clinch a 6-4, 6-2 win. \n\"I think she looked amazing out there,\" Rossi said of Jacobs. \"She really kicked it up a notch. She played great all year long but this is probably the best level of play that I've seen her. She played one of the past champions. Coming in as a freshman and just experiencing this is just unbelievable right now. So she knows where to set the bar and what she's got to work to in order to get it.\" \nRELATED: Southern Lehigh's Nina DeLuna gets best of friend Elessa Jacobs \nIt was the first loss of the season for Jacobs, who dropped to 21-1 in singles play. \nThe freshman, whose mom Cyndi was a field hockey player at Easton, has been key for the Red Rovers, who went from 3-9 in 2014 to 13-4 this season. \n\"I'm just ecstatic to have Elessa on our team. It raises the bar for everybody else,\" Rossi said. \"And they support her dearly to come out and win. They all showed up here today. It's just a great group and she just leads the pack. I'm happy she's here and that she did so well. I'm proud of her.\" \nAlthough it didn't result in gold, Jacobs thoroughly enjoyed her first trip to the district singles finals. \n\"It's amazing. It's such an amazing experience,\" Jacobs said. \"And just to be here, it's just amazing with all the fans supporting me. It was really fun.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:39:23.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
