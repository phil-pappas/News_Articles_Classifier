But, our kids did, too,\" El Dorado Coach Scott Reed said. \"They didn't back down one inch. We're one play away from winning the game. Unfortunately, that's where we are. But, I feel a whole lot better about tonight's effort and game than I did about a week ago. I'm so proud of our kids. Coaches, too. I think our defensive staff did a good job.\" \nThe Zebras' four-game scoreless streak was snapped in the first quarter. El Dorado (4-4, 2-3) became the first team to score a first-quarter touchdown against Pine Bluff when Love threw a 46-yard pass to Rhett Conner. \nKawon Love rushed for 123 yards on 24 attempts with 1 touchdown. He also passed for a score and caught three passes for 45 yards. John Sixbey was 6-of-17 passing for 108 yards. Defensively, the Wildcats recovered four fumbles. \n\"I'm telling you, our kids right now, they're not happy that we lost. But, they know that we belong,\" said Reed. \"We hadn't had many moral victories in the past and I don't want that at all. But, if we keep getting this kind of effort, we're going to be back in it pretty soon.\" \nPine Bluff led 21-14 at halftime, but Mitchell Emrich's 3-yard touchdown run with 9:32 left in the third quarter tied the game at 21-21. \nSkelton's 4-yard touchdown run put the Zebras back on top, 27-21, with 2:33 left in the third quarter. \nLove tied the game at 27-27 with a two-yard run, but the point-after attempt was blocked by Pine Bluff's Keshawn Whaley. \nThe Zebras responded, as Skelton converted on a third-and-2 with a 4-yard run. Two plays later, he handed a shotgun snap that was high, found a crease to the right side, cut back across the field to his left and outran the Wildcats' secondary for a 63-yard touchdown run. \nIt was the third straight loss for El Dorado, which began the season 4-1. The Wildcats still have to win their way into the postseason. Reed believes Friday night's effort could get them there. \n\"I'm so proud of our kids tonight,\" he said. \"We've been through a tough couple of weeks. They bought in to the, 'Are we the 4-1 or the 4-3 team?' Unfortunately, the result is not a win. But, it's a step in the right direction, no doubt. It's a huge step because that's by far the best team we've seen. They are very talented. They are physical. And, we matched that tonight. \n\"It's going to hurt tomorrow when you look at the score but there was a lot of good that came out of tonight.\" \nSports on 10/24/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:19:02.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
