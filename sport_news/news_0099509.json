The group has since met several times to develop ideas for addressing the issues that arise out of the island’s events — crowds, excessive drinking and other public safety concerns.\nIn a letter dated Oct. 6, Demery Bishop, chairman of the crowd control task force, recommended to Buelterman that the city prohibit the consumption of alcohol “in specific public places.”\nThe goal, Bishop wrote, is to regulate crowds, traffic and enhance public safety across the island. Other coastal communities have adopted similar policies with some success, he wrote.\n“We’re not saying that we’re going to go out there and sniff everybody’s cups to see what’s inside their cups or anything of that sort,” said Tybee Police Capt. Joel Fobes. “It’s just a tool to help us when sometimes the crowds get a little out of hand. If you want to vote for it, fine. If you don’t, it’s not going to be a heartbreak.”\nThe city has some options for implementing a new policy, Fobes said. The initial recommendation developed by the task force was to ban open air drinking except in the case of events, where organizers can petition the city to sell wristbands for outside alcohol consumption.\n“When you’re in the festival zone, you could go down there and drink,” he said. “What it stops is people going down to the beach with a cooler full of beer, just drinking. It would cause the people to have to get up and actually go to the bars or go to the convenience store in order to purchase something to drink.”\nConversely, Fobes said, the city could adopt a policy that prohibits outdoor alcohol use during large events or busy times of year.\nThe amount of effort put into developing these proposals certainly merits further discussion, said Public Safety Committee Chairwoman Wanda Doyle, but the discussion should encompass more city officials.\nTybee is one of the last remaining towns on the East Coast without tough alcohol consumption restrictions. It’s fostered a good atmosphere for groups and families who join together at city facilities like Memorial Park, Doyle said, and whatever happens next will be an important move on the part of the city.\nShe added that no members of the ad hoc task force were present to provide input Thursday.\n“The whole council needs to be involved in this so we are all on the same page and together with this. It’s an important process,” Doyle said. “A lot of people spent time on it. When you talk about prohibiting it in public places, island wide, I don’t know.”\n“It’s just against our culture,” Councilman Bill Garbett said.\nCouncilman Monty Parks, who stressed he is skeptical of an island-wide ban, said visitors to Tybee “treasure their afternoons on the beach.”\nHe said he favored restrictions that would cut back on the public consumption later in the evenings.\n“They look forward to it, their Sunday afternoon with a glass of wine or watching a sunset or sunrise on the beach,” Parks said. “I think they live for that. However, I agree after 9 o’clock at night on 16th Street, helping (police) in your job, maybe slowing down the party a little bit might be a good step.”\nThe public safety committee will convene again to discuss the proposal at 10 a.m., Nov. 12 at the city’s public safety building, 78 Van Horne St.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:18:04.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
