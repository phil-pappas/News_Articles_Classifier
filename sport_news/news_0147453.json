The defense was dominating and a one-score lead looked like it could hold on a wet and windy afternoon. \nBut St. Joseph found the end zone on all three of its third-quarter possessions, two of which started with short fields due to Vineland miscues, and built a lead too great for Vineland to overcome. \n“We gave them the game,” Seymore said. “They didn’t beat us.” Vineland football: Reyes, Bokma impressing as freshmen \nSeymore gave Vineland (2-2) its early lead as he took a pitch 56 yards to pay dirt on the team’s second play from scrimmage. \n“He just had a great run,” St. Joseph coach Paul Sacco said. “He’s a horse. He’s a load to tackle.” \nSeymore’s run was insult to injury for the Wildcats (3-1), as their star running back A’Laam Horne was lost for the game just a few minutes earlier after hurting his ankle. \nA’Laam’s absence, along with some timely Vineland defense, stymied St. Joseph’s attack in the first half. \nOn the Wildcats’ first drive after Seymore’s touchdown, quarterback Salaam Horne had a 46-yard scamper, but Fighting Clan linebacker Jarred Banks tracked him down and stripped the ball, which his teammate Rodney Melton recovered. \n“I saw him going, I knew he was fast, but I just tried to take the best angle,” Banks said. “I didn’t know he fumbled till I saw the other player jump on it.” \nSt. Joseph threatened again at the end of the first half, as a low snap on a punt gave the Wildcats possession on Vineland’s 40, but Banks stepped up again, intercepting Salaam Horne near the goal line as time expired. \n“We thought we won and that was it,” Seymore said of his team’s attitude at halftime. “We thought we won and started messing up.” Buy Photo Varsity Football: Vineland at St. Joseph Jose F.
