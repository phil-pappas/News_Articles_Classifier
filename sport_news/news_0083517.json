It must happen. But before anything can happen, one man needs to sign off, and we seem to be collectively overlooking his importance to this process. \nThat man, of course, is John Henry. \nThe team's principal owner has a long and complicated history with aces. He acquired Curt Schilling over Thanksgiving dinner in 2003 and gave him a bonus in the unlikely event of a World Series , a clause that paid off handsomely (before being outlawed by MLB). \nHe let Pedro Martinez walk in 2004, and then months later traded his best prospect, Hanley Ramirez , to acquire Josh Beckett , which helped win another title. \nHe signed John Lackey to a big free agent deal that looked like a disaster until it was a steal. He extended Beckett and then counted his blessings when the Dodgers offered a bailout. He bid adieu to Jon Lester without much of a fight before watching the 2015 season collapse without the big lefty. \nAlong the way, Henry made a few points abundantly clear. Long-term contracts in free agency almost never end well. Giving a lot of money to a pitcher in his 30s is a terrible idea. Today's best teams win with young cores, not old ones. \nNow Dombrowski's here in place of Ben Cherington to head up baseball operations, and the assumption is that he'll find an ace by any means necessary, whether it's via free agency or trade. Presumably no one is off the table. \nThat means the Red Sox will make a free agent run at David Price , kick the tires on Johnny Cueto, explore a deal with Jordan Zimmermann. It means they'll talk trade, whether it's for Oakland's Sonny Gray, Cleveland's Carlos Carrasco, or San Diego's Tyson Ross. Maybe they'll shock us with a short-term stopgap like Lackey (fat chance of that). \nBut to assume any of the above is to presume that Dombrowski has been given 100 percent autonomy, and that's not how things work. Dombrowski must answer to Henry, and we still don't know exactly where the owner stands on the issue of acquiring a No. 1 starter in light of three last-place finishes in four years. \nWe know what he has said in the past, like in a 2014 interview with Bloomberg when he declared: \"… virtually all of the underpaid players are under 30 and virtually all the overpaid players are over 30. Yet teams continue to extravagantly overpay for players above the age of 30.\" \nAnd we know what he has said on multiple occasions specifically about the bad business of overpaying pitchers in their 30s, which is why, despite his clear personal affinity for Lester last winter, he let his ace be whisked off to Chicago. \n\"We're more discerning with free agents in their 30s,\" Henry said last spring. \nNow imagine Dombrowski presenting a seven-year, $200 million proposal to Henry to land Price this winter. Such an offer would check virtually every \"don't\" on Henry's list, from Price's age (30), to the length of the deal, to the fact that it would be coming in free agency. \nFor Henry to sign off on such an expenditure would require him to renounce his core beliefs. Maybe the fear of yet another second-division finish has caused him to reconsider and throw caution to the wind. \nMore likely, if you ask me, is that Henry hasn't changed his philosophies one bit. He still sees such deals as needlessly risky and perilous. \nIn other words: Let the Sonny Gray Watch begin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:12:53.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
