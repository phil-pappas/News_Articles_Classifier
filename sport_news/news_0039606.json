Last season's team was big and physical and could muscle down low with the best of them, this year's team, Calipari says not so much. \n\"That we're not as tough as I thought we'd be. I thought we'd be more of a tough -- not a rough house team, but I thought we'd be able to hold ground. We're just going to have to train them, make them -- they got to be more aggressive. I know all of the fouls that are going to be called. That's fine. This is a team. Let them call fouls on us, but just -- lets go.\" Said Coach Cal. \nPart of the reason this year's team is not as physical is the size differential. Cal says having more guards will be an adjustment early on in the seaosn. \n\"How do we play if we're playing three guards? How do we defend if we're playing three guards? I mean, there's a lot of things that we have to come to grips with on. Last year we played 7-foot, 6-11, and 610. Now we're playing with three guards the very next year? Okay. How are we going to play, because it's totally different.\" Said Cal. \nCalipari has down played his team all off-season, but fans will get to judge the Wildcats for themselves Friday night when they take the court for Big Blue Madness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:10:10.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
