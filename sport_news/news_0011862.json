It was going to be in front of a big crowd, and it was going to go back and forth.” \n“A gallant effort,” said IHA coach Maria Nolan, whose team had not lost to a Garden State foe since an epic three-setter versus Bogota in the 2012 Bergen County final in this gym. “This loss is a loss just to start a new streak.” \nNV/Old Tappan (9-0) owned the height advantage and was swinging with confidence. Senior setter Kelly Brogan set arguably New Jersey’s deepest corps of hitters to the tune of 22 assists. Illovsky and senior middle Kirsten Kaiser delivered seven kills apiece, sophomore middle Julia Passante six and senior hitter Natalie Alechko five to go along with her team-high 13 digs. \n“Even when we were down a couple of points, we stayed together and we didn’t want to get too down on ourselves,” Brogan said. “It’s just working together and communicating and trusting.” \nNV/Old Tappan fighting back from the 14-6 deficit in the second set was significant. Immaculate Heart’s front line, including seniors Annabel Reyes (6 kills) and Casey King (6 kills), were putting up a formidable block. Nevertheless, the Golden Knights chipped away, and back-to-back kills by Illovsky cut the deficit to 22-21. Her kill tied it at 26. Her final kill came after an IHA service error. \nSo what does NV/Old Tappan defeating IHA mean beyond ending a 93-match winning streak? Well, the Golden Knights should receive the top spot at Tuesday’s Bergen tournament seeding meeting, and the final is here Nov. 1. Beyond that, who knows? \nSaid Nolan: “I’m confident that now that we’ve played them – that was a strong team, that was a great match to play – we’re glad to have the opportunity to play here, and we’ll rebound.” \nSaid Landeck: “I think that when you’ve been successful, teams want to beat you. I don’t think today changes that. When you’ve been consistently good — and there’s a lot of other programs besides us that have been consistently good – people want to beat you.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:50:51.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
