At stumps, Punjab (434/5 in 127 overs) were just 33 runs behind Gujarat first innings total of 467. Manan Vohra (104) scored a patient century while Uday Kaul (78) hung around to strengthen the hostsâ€™ position at the end of Day Three. Gujarat gave four reprieves, two each to Yuvraj Singh and Manan Vohra, to let the game slip away from their hands. Centurion Vohra would have been out on the first ball had part time wicketkeeper Samit Gohel held on to an edge. Yuvraj began his innings with a six over long on and completed his half century with a backfoot punch. Romesh Powar gave Yuvraj a reprieve after he misjudged a catch outside the 30-yard circle. From there on, the Punjab batsmen relished on Gujarat's mild bowling attack. Jiwanjot Singh (51) was the first one to go as he lost his concentration after completing his half-century.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:04:24.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
