The Tigers are the first team in the two-year history of the CFCC to make a double-digit jump to No. 1.\nThe geometric mean difference between LSU and No. 2 Utah is just 0.14 of a place, with Ohio State close behind at No. 3.\nLast week's No. 1, TCU, slid five spots to No. 6 after a tougher-than-expected win a Iowa State.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. For the second consecutive week, none of the five formulas that combine into the CFCC had the same No. 1 team. Michigan State is No. 1 in Richard Billingsley 's rankings, Utah is No. 1 in Wes Colley 's rankings, Baylor is No. 1 in Ken Massey 's rankings, Alabama is No. 1 in Jeff Sagarin 's rankings, and LSU is No. 1 in Peter Wolfe 's rankings.\nLSU was seventh and 10th, respectively, in Massey and Sagarin's rankings — the only two of the five formulas that factor in margin of victory — but was ranked second by Billingsley and Colley.\nUtah State jumped 23 spots to No. 40 after forcing eight turnovers in a 52-26 win Saturday against Boise State. Kansas State, which lost 55-0 to Oklahoma on Saturday, was this week's biggest decliner, falling 25 spots.\nThe College Football Computer Composite combines five of the computer formulas used in the former Bowl Championship Series standings to remove the human element from college football rankings. It is compiled by taking the geometric mean of rankings formulated by Billingsley, Colley, Massey, Sagarin and Wolfe. Among the metrics feeding the CFCC are wins and losses, strength of schedule, home-field advantage, recency of game and, in Massey and Sagarin's case, margin of victory.\nUpdated CFCC rankings are published each week during the season on FootballFour.com . The complete ranking of all 128 FBS teams is below.", "external_links": ["http://footballfour.usatoday.com/", "http://prwolfe.bol.ucla.edu/cfootball/home.htm", "http://imgur.com/RkHpsVv.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768715971618409-football-four-promo2.jpg", "http://archive.azcentral.com/ic/news/projects/css/linkset.css", "http://cfrc.com/", "http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Bowl%20Championship%20Series", "http://www.colleyrankings.com/"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:36:09.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
