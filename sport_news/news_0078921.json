But the strangest thing happened to me at the Georgia-Missouri game on Saturday.\nOn the first play, Georgia’s pass was tipped and intercepted by a Missouri player who took off for the end zone. Horrified, I clapped my hands to my temples like blinders. The lady to my left shouted, “No, no, no,” as the Missouri player pounded toward the goal. She clamped a hand on my shoulder and spoke above the roar. “Don’t look. You don’t want to see it. He’s going to make a touchdown.”\nThough the Dawgs tackled him short of the goal line, it looked like a score from our vantage point.\nTo my surprise, tears sprang to my eyes.\nI have never once cried over the game of football. Not when Heisman winner Herschel Walker turned pro after his junior year. Not when Auburn, by pure, dumb luck, beat us on the last play of the game a couple of years ago. Not even when Nick Chubb’s knee bent outward in a sickening arc in the Tennessee game. And Nick Chubb has been my favorite player since he was fiddling second to Todd Gurley.\nThe last two losses sank our spirits after such a strong start to the season. Alabama we could understand, but Tennessee? And now Missouri had humiliated us on the first play.\nStill, that was nothing to cry about. So what was happening?\nMaybe my husband Bill’s chance encounter with Coach Mark Richt had something to do with it. The day before Saturday’s game, Bill crossed paths with Mr. Richt when the coach was on the way to a team meeting. Bill shook his hand and said, “Coach, your effort to instill values and integrity into the players is the most important thing you do for the team.”\nMy guess is that Coach Richt hasn’t heard many positive words lately.\nThen, the night before the game I read a piece in The Red and Black, the student newspaper. The article described the way the team has rallied around Nick Chubb since his injury.\n“It seems that every Georgia player has shared a prayer with running back Nick Chubb this week and pleaded for fans to do the same.”\nJay Rome, a Bulldog who fought back from an injury himself, was Quote: d as saying, “I prayed with him and let him know that sometimes you can’t lean on yourself all on your own. You have to put your trust in God. He has the master plan.”\nTight end Jeb Blazevich added, “. . . please pray for Nick. We’re just concerned about him as a person right now, not as a much as a player.”\nIt hurts to see guys like that stumble in front of 90,000 hopeful fans. It hurts enough to cry.\nThe spirit among them seldom develops out of nothing. When times get tough throughout their lives, the young men on Mark Richt’s teams will be able to remember how to handle trouble. Uphold one another and trust in God.\nI suppose it depends on which game we’re talking about, but in life in the long game that’s called winning.\nCarol Megathlin is a Savannah writer.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:12:02.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
