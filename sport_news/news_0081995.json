I already told them that this is going to be my last year, regardless (of what happens),” Perasol said.\nBut he said Ateneo’s current woes had nothing to do with his impending departure.\n“Alam nila lahat yan this is my last year. My team knows that, my players know that, kaya this is our last hurrah together, with Kiefer (Ravena) and Von (Pessumal).”\nPressure on Perasol had been mounting especially after Ateneo’s 80-76 loss to archrival La Salle last week.\nReports said that several backers were willing to make a midseason coaching change but Ateneo president Jett Villarin gave his full support to the former Air21 and Powerade mentor.\nHowever, Perasol, whose three-year contract expires after the season, will leave regardless of the team’s fate.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:13:25.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
