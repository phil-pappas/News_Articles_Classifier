(Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images) \nChris Culliver wasn’t 100 percent, but he suited up anyway in Sunday’s 23-20 win over the Eagles, drawing praise from teammate Ricky Jean Francois . \nGiven how he looked while getting beat on a pair of long touchdown passes against Philadelphia and the importance of getting healthy before facing Atlanta’s Julio Jones in Week 5, Culliver shouldn’t have any problem taking it slow during his walks with his four rescue dogs this week. The Redskins cornerback, who is featured in a new PETA ad promoting Walk Your Dog Week , would urge fellow dog owners to do the same. \n“[A] lot of times, we get busy and tied up in things that we’re doing … not giving our animals enough love and care,” Culliver says in a PETA release. “[W]hen you’re walking your dogs, just don’t rush, don’t be on the phone, and take time out to actually bond with your dog.” \nCulliver loves dogs. Last year, his foundation put on a dog show to support the American Bully Kennel Club and he has posted several photos of his own dogs on Instagram. \nScott Allen writes about all things D.C. sports.
