(Photo: Kinfay Moroti/news-press.com) Buy Photo \nSouth Fort Myers (5-1, 0-0) at Riverdale (3-4, 0-1) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — South Fort Myers: This is a District 7A-12 game where South will be without its leading rusher, E'Quan Dorris, for the second game after he underwent an emergency appendectomy last week. Sophomore running back Fa'Najay Gotay filled in during a 35-7 win over Ida Baker last week, rushing for 164 yards and two touchdowns. The Wolfpack defense is also firing on all cylinders. It held Baker's productive spread offense to just 32 yards from scrimmage. The key matchup in this one will be South's defensive front seven vs. Riverdale's huge offensive line. Riverdale: Already having lost a game in this three-team district, this is a must-win for the Raiders. Coach Damon Jones team got back on track with a rout of DeSoto County last week, but South is a different animal. The offensive line must give quarterback Daniel Ulmer time to throw in third-down situations and Ulmer must utilize 6-foot-4 target Jacob Tracey, who has 24 receptions for 441 yards and five touchdowns this season. \nThe News-Press' pick: South Fort Myers 28, Riverdale 14 \nEstero (2-5, 1-0) at Fort Myers (4-2, 1-0) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — Estero: This is a District 6A-11 matchup. The teams enter this contest with 1-0 district records and the winner likely will finish the season as district champion. Estero opened the season 0-5 but has back-to-back victories against East Lee County and a 21-20 victory last week against Golden Gate. Fort Myers: The Green Wave are coming off what coach Sam Sirianni Jr. described as a much-needed bye week. Of 10 key players who missed action two weeks ago because of various injuries, about half are expected to return. Fort Myers has an all-time record of 19-3 against Estero and has not lost to the Wildcats since falling 27-6 in 2001. “They’re 1-0, and we’re 1-0,” Sirianni said. “I don’t care what they did before that. They’ve made great strides in the past two weeks.” \nThe News-Press pick: Fort Myers 42, Estero 10 \nDunbar (4-1, 1-0) at Cypress Lake (2-4, 1-1) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nRadio : 93.3 FM \nOnline : Livecast on TigerFM.com \nWhat to watch for – Dunbar : The Tigers escaped Island Coast with a 34-20 win last week. Running back Abraham Alce had 144 yards and three touchdowns. Dunbar trailed at half. The Tigers score 28 points per game against just 13 given up. This game starts a stretch of three straight district games. Cypress : The Panthers lost their second straight game on Friday, this time 28-20 to Lemon Bay. Clifford Moore had his third 100-yard game in four outings with 101 yards. The Panthers are being outscored 52-20 in their last two outings. They allowed five sacks and had four turnovers last week. They are scoring just 18 points per game against 27 given up. \nThe News-Press' pick: Dunbar 27, Cypress Lake 20 \nIda Baker (3-4, 1-1) at Port Charlotte (3-3, 2-0) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — Baker: This is a crucial District 6A-10 Baker has to have. Port Charlotte is the favorite to earn the second playoff spot in the district. Bulldogs coach Brian Conn challenged his players' effort and heart following a loss to South Fort Myers where it managed just 32 yards of offense during a season where it averages over 300 yards a game. Port Charlotte's bruising running game threatens to move the chains and keep Baker's high-powered offense off the field. Quarterback Jordan Diggs needs to take advantage of every possession Friday. Port Charlotte: The Pirates are coming off a 36-21 loss to undefeated Sebring. \nThe News-Press' pick: Port Charlotte 35, Ida Baker 31 \nMulberry (1-5, 1-2) at Bishop Verot (5-2, 2-1) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nWhat to watch for – Mulberry : Lost 34-32 in a shootout to Lake Placid last week. Only fell to Avon Park by six previously. Scoring only 12 points per game and giving up nearly 32 points per contest. The Panthers have given up 40 points twice in losses. Bishop Verot : The Vikings picked up a 38-28 win over East Lee County. They fell to Avon Park 18-7 two weeks ago. Running back William Scott was back from a two-game suspension and picked up his fourth 200-yard game. He has 959 yards in just five games. The quarterback carousel continues with Korey Besse and Alex McDougall. Deven Thompkins has four interceptions in the secondary this season. \nThe News-Press' pick: Bishop Verot 35, Mulberry 13 \nLehigh (1-5, 0-1) at East Lee County (1-4, 0-1) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nWhat to watch for – Lehigh : The Lightning can pick up a crucial District 6A-11 win and stay in the hunt for a playoff bid, despite their record. They beat Cape Coral 34-23 last week. Lehigh has given up at least 20 points in three losses. Its schedule to end the regular season includes winnable games against East Lee, Estero and Riverdale. The defense is yielding 30 points per contest. East Lee County : The Jaguars fell 38-28 to Bishop Verot in a competitive game. They’ve given up at least 30 points in the last four games. East Lee is scoring nearly 22 points per game and giving up 33. Lothario Adderley is leading the team in rushing. \nThe News-Press' pick: Lehigh 36, East Lee County 12 \nCharlotte (6-0, 2-0) at North Fort Myers (2-4, 0-2) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nWhat to watch for – Charlotte : The Tarpons, the seventh best team in Class 6A, are coming off a bye. They haven’t failed to score more than 40 points in a game. They’re averaging less than five points given up per game and could tie last year’s mark for wins with a victory over the Red Knights. Elijah Mack has rushed for 680 yards, averaging just 15 carries per game. Quarterback Brennan Sims has a completion percentage of 63 and has passed for 1,123 yards and has been intercepted just once. North Fort Myers : The Red Knights fell to Port Charlotte 33-27 last week in a game they needed to remain in the hunt for a District 6A-10 playoff bid. This is a must win. Running back Zaquandre White was back last week and rushed for 47 yards. He caught two passes for 55 yards and two touchdowns. J’Ravien Anderson leads the offense at quarterback and has 939 yards passing and 263 yards rushing. Defense is giving up 24 points per game. The Red Knights need to find a way to stop potent Tarpons attack. \nThe News-Press' pick: Chartlotte 32, North Fort Myers 28 \nImmokalee (2-4, 1-0) at Mariner (2-4, 0-2) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nWhat to watch for – Immokalee : The Indians fell in a close one to Palmetto Ridge, 22-20, last Friday. It was their third loss in four games. They give up 27 points per game and score about 18 per contest. Malcom Jackson is the team’s leading rushing with 501 yards. The Indians can remain undefeated in 5A-12 with a win. Mariner : The Tritons lost to Lely 49-27 last week. They’ve given up 40 points in three losses and scored the most points in a game they have all season last week. They average 174 yards rushing per game behind Geovanni Garcia, who has 404 yards this season. The team scores just 16 points per game and gives up on average nearly 30. \nThe News-Press' pick: Immokalee 34, Mariner 14 \nIsland Coast (2-5, 1-1) at Cape Coral (1-5, 0-2) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nRadio: 1240/1270 AM \nWhat to watch for – Island Coast : The Gators have given up at least 28 points in all seven games this season. They fell to Dunbar 34-20 last week after grabbing the lead early. Quarterback Kory Curtis is hitting just 46 percent of his receivers and has been intercepted four times. Antonio Greaves leads the team in rushing with 403 yards. Marlon Gaymon leads in receiving with 32 catches for 449 yards. Cape Coral : The Seahawks lost their fifth straight game last week to Lehigh. The Seahawks give up nearly 45 points per game, despite scoring nearly 27 points per contest. Cape Coral averages 380 yards of total offense. Quarterback Maurice Flournoy was injured in last week’s game and is questionable this week. Receiver CJ Lewis leads the team with 26 receptions for 366 yards and six touchdowns. \nThe News-Press' pick: Island Coast 42, Cape Coral 20 \nCommunity School (5-1, 2-1) at Evangelical Christian (2-4, 1-2) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — CSN: This is a District 2A-7 game. The Seahawks lost their grip on first place in the district with a 47-7 loss to First Baptist last week, but holds the head-to-head tiebreaker over Moore Haven for the second playoff berth. The Seahawks defense missed two chances to get off the field on third-and-long situations early against FBA and it snowballed from there. George Schmelzle and Joe Lang have each hit the 400-yard rushing mark this season. ECS: The Sentinels picked up a much-needed victory over St. John Neumann last week after losing three straight. Quarterback Michael Marcelak and running back Chris Ceasar carried the offense in the win, combining for nearly 250 yards on the ground. They'll have their hands full against a defense that has given up more than 20 points just twice this season. \nThe News-Press' pick: Community School 24, ECS 14 \nPalmetto Ridge (6-0, 1-0) at Naples (5-1, 1-0) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — Palmetto Ridge: This game could serve as a de facto District 6A-12 championship game. Palmetto Ridge needed a late touchdown drive to hold off Immokalee at home last week with its undefeated season in jeopardy. As usual, running back Jaheem Washington, the area's leading rusher, will be a huge factor in the Bears offense. Immokalee's speed on defense kept him below his yards per game average, showing that Palmetto Ridge is vulnerable when the senior doesn't hit his number. Against Naples' stingy defense, Bears quarterback Cody Young needs to be a threat with his arm to keep the Golden Eagles' safeties from crowding the box. Naples: The Golden Eagles have never lost to Palmetto Ridge in 10 meetings. In addition to the defense giving up just 13 points since the season opener, the offense has been nothing short of dominant. Tennessee running back commit Carlin Fils-Aime's touches have been limited this season thanks to a few blowouts, but expect coach Bill Kramer to unleash him in this crucial district game. A talented Palmetto Ridge front seven will be tested this week and have to get off blocks to keep Friday from becoming the Fils-Aime show. \nThe News-Press' pick: Naples 45, Palmetto Ridge 24 \nGolden Gate (3-4, 0-1) at Barron Collier (5-2, 0-1) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — Golden Gate: This is a District 6A-12 game. This young Titans team needs to win its last three games to match its win total from each of the last two seasons. Quarterback Chris Nazaire was stopped on a go-ahead two-point conversion during a 21-20 loss to Estero last week. The defense, which will have to account for Barron Collier running backs Jamel Davis and Kerry Brown, is surrendering 27.5 points per game this week. Barron Collier: The Cougars' postseason hopes rest on taking care of business this week and then upsetting Naples, a tall order that could leave the Cougars with seven wins and on the outside looking in. Tight end Matt Heuerman continues to have an impressive senior season, catching 46 balls for 598 yards and seven touchdowns, and could be poised for a huge performance Friday. \nThe News-Press' pick: Barron Collier 34, Golden Gate 6 \nSFCA (3-3, 1-2) at Marco Island Academy (2-4, 1-2) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — SFCA: This is a District 2A-7 game. The Kings dropped their second district game last week with a 48-35 loss to Moore Haven. In the game, SFCA gave up four passing touchdowns to the Terriers. In order to defeat a pass-happy Marco Island Academy, the Kings will have to generate interceptions. Look for them to do that with Tristian Upton, Chase Reed and Luke Griner, who all have two interceptions apiece on the year. Marco Island Academy: The Manta Rays had a bye week to prepare for the Kings after a 42-16 loss to First Baptist Academy on Oct. 2. Look for Marco Island to air it out with quarterback Andrew Fowler. Fowler has thrown for eight touchdowns on the year and has passed for 1,008 yards, the most in District 2A-7. \nThe News-Press pick: SFCA 38, Marco Island Academy 35 \nGateway Charter (0-6, 0-3) at Lakeland Tenoroc (3-3, 2-1) \nTime: 7:30 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — Gateway Charter: This is a District 4A-6 game. The Griffins lost last week to Avon Park 53-7, their second straight loss allowing 50 points or more. Look for Gateway Charter to improve their defensive play this week against a team that has only scored 55 points on the season. Lakeland Tenoroc: The Titans defeated LaBelle last week in an overtime thriller 10-9. Tenoroc, currently third in District 4A-6 behind Avon Park and Bishop Verot, will look to move up in the district standings with a win. \nThe News-Press pick: Tenoroc 33, Gateway Charter 12 \nFirst Baptist (5-1) at Haines City Landmark Christian (0-6) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nWhat to watch for — First Baptist: The Lions picked up a big victory in a District 2A-7 game last week over then first-place team Community School of Naples. Look for the Lions to add to their four-game winning streak tonight as they will face Landmark Christian with a defense that has only allowed 86 points on the year. Haines City Landmark Christian: The Patriots lost last week to Admiral Farragut 64-0, their third time being shut out loss this year. \nThe News-Press pick: First Baptist 49, Landmark Christian 7 \nLaBelle (3-4, 2-2) at Lake Placid (2-5, 1-3) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nWhat to watch for – LaBelle: The Cowboys look to recover from a 10-9 loss to Teneroc. Senior Hugo Vargas has completed 45 percent of his passes and thrown for 180 yards on 40 attempts. Tray Williams continues to lead the Cowboys’ rushing attack, posting 895 yards on 135 carries. Lake Placid: The Dragons host LaBelle in a conference matchup after a close game against Mulberry \nThe News-Press' pick: LaBelle 28, Lake Placid 14 \nSt. John Neumann (0-6, 0-4) at Moore Haven (6-1, 3-1) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nWhat to watch for – SJN: The Celtics look to grab their first victory in an away game against the Terriers after a 32-7 loss to Evangelical Christian School. This season, St. John Neumann has allowed 227 points and has only scored 45. Moore Haven: Senior D’Angelo Ware leads the Terrier rushing with 432 yards on 42 carries. John Cox has thrown for 357 yards and has a .575 completion percentage. \nThe News-Press' pick: Moore Haven 35, Neumann 0 Read or Share this story: http://newspr.es/1RKZfUY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:12:00.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
