A Sanford player took a shot near the top of the circle, but on its way to the cage, the ball was deflected on its way and flew over to end the opportunity. \nPadua had six shots in the overtime, but just one was on goal because Amendum was aggressive in cutting down angles, forcing the Pandas to take difficult shots that hit the side of the cage. \n“I just had it in my head that I have to keep us in it, and that’s my job to make sure we stay in it,” said Amendum, who made six saves. “I just keep my feet moving and keep on my angles and watching the ball the whole time.” \nPadua had the better chances in the first, and Sanford (8-2-1) had the better opportunities in the second, but neither could get those multishot chances that lead to goals.

I think everyone was playing defense because nobody knew how the game was going to go,” Panda coach Jayne Hughes said. “We’re both great teams. I think it was going to come down to who was getting it in the first, so I think everyone was playing defense on both sides to make sure it wasn’t going to happen.” \nHailey Power made four saves for Padua.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:09:33.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
