Five days in this heat - you need to be 100% before you start. \n\"I think he'll be fine, but we'll see how he gets through training today and make a decision tomorrow morning. He'll know how his body feels and how empty he is.\" \nStokes took 4-57 as Pakistan made 523-8 declared in their first innings in last week's drawn first Test in Abu Dhabi and followed that up with 57 as England replied with 598-9 declared. \nIf Stokes is passed fit, Cook has hinted that England are likely to name an unchanged side after they went close to winning the first Test on a dramatic final day. \nThere have been suggestions they may decide to rest seamer Mark Wood, who has been troubled by an ankle problem, with Liam Plunkett a likely replacement, while a third spinner could also be an option with Samit Patel coming into the side alongside Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid. \nCook added: \"Everyone else has pulled up pretty well. I haven't seen the wicket, whether it is a three-spinner wicket here or not, so we have to look at that option to see whether we need it or not. But my gut instinct is we will probably stay the same.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:27:09.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
