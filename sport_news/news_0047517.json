But which five of these have been outstanding so far heading into the second international break of the season. \nDEDE AYEW \nHis long awaited move to the Premier League materialized over the summer and much was expected from the Black Stars deputy captain and he has not failed to deliver. \nFour goals in his first eight matches is a fantastic return considering the difficulty of the league. To make issues more interesting, three of the four goals - 75% - have come with headers. \nAgain, three out of these four goals have been against last season’s top six (Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham). \nHis impressive start saw him claim the Barclays Premiership Player of the Month in August. Despite having cooled off a wee bit in September, he resumed normal service in October grabbing Swansea’s first goal against Tottenham. \nSo far, so good for Dede, and more will expected from him as the season wears on especially during the December period where matches come in thick and fast. \nJEFFREY SCHLUPP \nSchlupp is one of the least mentioned Black Stars players but he is arguably the most consistent player in the Stars set-up. \nWeek in, week out, the Leicester has performed his role admirably be it as left back or left wing. Blessed with considerable pace, the left footed player is hardly beaten by opponents in a league where most games are frantic. \nHis winner on Saturday was testament to his non stop running all season. Baba Rahman and Andre Ayew’s inclusion in the Black Stars will possibly still keep Schlupp out of the side, but if Baba continues to be a bench warmer at Stamford Bridge, Schlupp could be considered for a starting berth. \nEMMANUEL AGYEMAN BADU \nThe former Asante Kotoko man has been one of the standout performers in a sluggish start for Udinese. \nDespite getting injured in their opening day victory over Juventus, Agyeman Badu has bounced back strongly to score two goals over the course of an early season. \nThe former U-20 World Cup winner was rumored to be joining Stoke over the summer but never materialized. All the same, he has kept a cool head to emerge as one of the leading figures of Udinese. Two goals in six matches is an impressive turnout for a player who uses his energy all over the pitch. If he maintains such good form, his wish to move to the Premier League will be a reality sooner rather than later. \nABDUL MAJEED WARIS \nOne of many Ghanaians who moved during the summer and he has taken over exactly where his compatriot Jordan Ayew left off for Lorient. \nWaris is arguably one of the natural number ‘9s’ the country currently possess but has been hampered by injury time and again. Even in France this season, he has had a few weeks off the pitch nursing an injury. \nOnce on the pitch, it is back to what he is doing best and that is finding the back of the net. \nWaris knows the way to go and that has been evidenced by his two goals in his first five Ligue 1 matches. He was a constant threat yesterday as he tormented the Bordeaux defence all night. He won a penalty last night and stepped up to duly convert. \nThe former Right to Dream Academy trainee has been nominated for his clubs Best Player of the month in September and this is testament to his impressive form at the beginning of the European season. \nAFRIYIE ACQUAH \nThe Torino hard man just like Agyemang Badu has been one of the mainstays in an impressive start to the season by the Turin side. \nAcquah has been strong pillar in the engine room of Torino adding grit and steel defensively as well as an additional presence upfront. \nHis main task has been pulling the strings in the middle and covering grounds, something which he has done to perfection so far. The added bonus to his fine start has been his goal scored this season. For a youngster who has been in the news for not so pleasant reasons, he has kept his composure and mental fortitude to produce consistent and polished displays week in, week out. \nDespite his side going down this weekend, Afriyie still received praise from his boss. “Acquah did do well, he was the only player who could cover all the roles in midfield,” Giampero Ventura said. \nThat has been the high levels set by Acquah this season. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
