The good thing about Raheem is that he wants to learn. \n\"He has started his career at City really well but hopefully we can slow him down a bit on Sunday and come out on top.\" \nHaving scored a record 11 goals in this fixture, Rooney's performance on Sunday could be decisive too. \nThe United captain has been criticised for a lean return of two goals in eight league matches this season, but continues to make significant achievements in the game. \nRooney, who turned 30 on Saturday, became England's all-time leading goalscorer in September and after scoring in the 3-0 win over Everton last week he became the joint second highest scorer in Premier League history alongside Andy Cole. \n\"He was a great striker over the years for Newcastle and for United, which I think was the best time of his career,\" Rooney said of Cole. \n\"He was a natural goalscorer, he was great to watch and he was a big player for United. \n\"It's great to be alongside him now. I am still quite a long way off Alan Shearer; he has 260 goals and that one may be difficult to reach, but I am pleased to be second with Andy.\" \nRooney reaching the landmark age of 30 has generated much debate about his ability and status at the club. \nFor Phil Jones, there is no doubt his United team-mate deserves to be regarded as one of the club's all-time greats. \nDefender Jones said: \"He's a great guy in the dressing room. He has a laugh and a joke but he's serious when he needs to be. \n\"He's a great lad, an unbelievable player and probably one of those who will go down as an all-time great for Manchester United.\" \nAnother derby winner like the famous one he struck in 2011 will help Rooney's standing, although t he former Everton forward does not believe the outcome of the match will be crucial in the race for the title. \nRooney added: \"Winning is top of our agenda, but you can't say whichever team wins will go on to win the title. \n\"There is a lot of local pride, we want to win and it's important that we go into the game confident. If we play the way we know we can, then we can certainly take the three points.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:20:53.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
