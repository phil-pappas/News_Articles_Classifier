(AP) - Former members of a now-disbanded fraternity chapter at the University of Michigan say they’re continuing a muddy tradition despite objections from the school and the national fraternity. \nThe Ann Arbor News reports (http://bit.ly/1Lloz2U ) the 82nd annual Mud Bowl is scheduled to take place Saturday outside the former Sigma Alpha Epsilon house. \nWater dumped in the yard makes for muddy play at the charity touch football game, which is held in in conjunction with the Ann Arbor school’s homecoming events. It was at risk of ending, but some former SAE members decided to host it as independent students. \nThe group called the “Flying Eagles” says they’ll play another group of students. \nOfficials from the university’s Interfraternity Council and Office of Greek Life have been encouraging their members not to participate. \n___ \nInformation from: The Ann Arbor News, http://www.mlive.com/ann-arbor \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:32:54.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
