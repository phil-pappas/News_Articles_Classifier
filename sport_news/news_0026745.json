His parents, Lindsay and Matt Austin, are determined to save his life. Meet the courageous 4-year-old Nebraska boy dying from a painful and rare genetic disease — and his determined parents who are on a mission to save him.\nLittle Ryan Austin has been fighting for his life since he was diagnosed last year with an extremely rare and incurable disorder called Hunter Syndrome, which leads to irreversible body and brain damage, his family said.\nThe brave boy endures seven-hour weekly drug infusions, administered with a needle through a hole along his rib cage, and has already undergone four major surgeries before his second birthday.\nBut even with the excruciating enzyme replacement treatments, doctors say Ryan is only expected to live until he's a teenager.\n\"We're determined to prove them wrong,\" his mother Lindsay Austin told the Daily News. “This fight is the fight of our lives.”\nfacebook Little Ryan Austin will slowly lose the ability to walk, eat, play and recognize the people he loves, his parents said. Ryan's persistent parents say they're not ready to stop fighting for their little boy who hasn't even given up on himself.\n\"He's so strong and so brave. Every day he hurts. He aches a lot. But he still faces every day with such a big smile and so much love,\" said Lindsay Austin, 27, adding that loved ones call him Ryan the Lion for his courage.\nThe little-known Hunter Syndrome causes delayed development, thickening of the lips and tongue, enlarged internal organs, respiratory problems, hearing loss, stunted growth, cardiovascular disorders and other devastating symptoms.\nThose who have the disease are missing an enzyme, or have a malfunctioning enzyme, that normally breaks down certain materials in cells and tissues, according to the National MPS Society.\nfacebook Ryan endures excrutiating seven-hour long enyzyme replacement treatments every week. There is an estimated 500 cases in the United States and about 2,000 worldwide.\n\"We were quite blindsided by it,\" Lindsay Austin said.\nRyan was born seemingly healthy, despite a pattern of getting sick. His parents' worlds were shattered when they learned what was causing the recurring illnesses and then researched it.\n\"I was overwhelmed. I felt like I was reading something wrong. It said it was deadly, that it would kill him after years of pain and suffering,\" Ryan's mom said.\nfacebook Ryan has the support of his father, Matt Austin, who is determined to find a cure for Hunter Syndrome. \"It was right there in front of me, telling me my baby was going to die,\" she added. \"I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. It was the worst day of my life.\"\nRyan has lost a lot of his ability to speak and understand words, his heartbroken mother said.\n\"He used to get excited about a gift. He would go, 'Wow!' Now he doesn't say words. He no longer says, 'I love you.' It's hard,\" she said.\nThe adorable toddler will slowly lose the ability to walk, eat, play and recognize the people he loves, his parents said.\nfacebook Doctors say Ryan would be lucky to live to his teenage years. His mother, Lindsay Austin, says Ryan will prove them wrong. But Lindsay and her husband Matt, 29, have been proactive in his treatments and medication and remain hopeful for a cure.\nThe couple has raised about $9,000 toward the Help Extinguish Hunter Syndrome nonprofit foundation, with funds being directed to Gene Therapy Research, the potential cure for Hunter Syndrome.\nThe Papillion parents have also worked tirelessly toward spreading awareness through their own \"Ryan Our Lion\" website .\n\"We just hold strong together,\" Lindsay Austin said.\nmchan@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories EXCLUSIVE: Sick Long Island boy meets idol Ellen DeGeneres Sick Long Island boy, 4, taken off life support, has died British teen dies from rare ‘Benjamin Button’ aging disease", "external_links": ["http://www.ryanourlion.com/#!ryans-page/c22nt", "http://www.extinguishhuntersyndrome.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:37:58.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
