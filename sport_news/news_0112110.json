You never saw him get up and scream and holler and pump his fist. \n“But we didn’t need that. Anquan (Boldin) was our emotional leader, and Larry fed us with his play on the field. Now, that whole team feeds off his energy.” \nThree weeks into a new season, and the Cardinals are full of great energy and great stories. None are better than the resurgence of Fitzgerald. He has 23 receptions. He has been targeted 28 times. He has five touchdowns, filling up a box score just like old times. \nAgainst the Bears, he corralled a touchdown pass while being strangled by a Bears defender. The referee didn’t even bother to throw a flag. \nAgainst the 49ers, he was pummeled after a catch in the end zone and simply refused to drop the football. He is more emotional because he has perspective, because he’s been starving for five years, because individual success means more than ever before, even if he can’t dare say so.

It happened with me. It happened with Anquan. Someone steps into a situation and says, ‘Yeah, he’s good. But we can find somebody better. Somebody faster. Somebody more explosive.’ \n“But you can’t. Guys like that can't be replaced. Guys like Larry, they always find a way to say, ‘Yeah, you thought you could find somebody better?’ ” \nWhen told he looks intensely satisfied with each passing reception, Fitzgerald said the following: \n\"The older you get the more you appreciate things. You see the hourglass run out of sand and you start to appreciate the relationships and all that's going on in your life a little more. I just thank B.A. (Bruce Arians) for the opportunity to win his trust.\" \nThe last five years have been complicated for Fitzgerald. During the final three seasons under Ken Whisenhunt, he dealt with a succession of inferior quarterbacks. He begged Warner to come out of retirement. And just when Carson Palmer arrived, it felt like Fitzgerald was being phased out of the offense by a new regime that just didn’t grasp his greatness. \nSurely, you remember his father’s tweet after the opening game in 2014, when Fitzgerald was targeted three times and produced one catch in a narrow win over the Chargers? \n“The whole world saw on Monday Night Football the politics and business of football. If it’s been decided that you’re not getting the ball, just win.” Arizona Cardinals podcast: The Bird's Eye View from Kent Somers and Mike Jurecki \nWhether that was true, false or just a father's love, here are the facts: Fitzgerald's targets dropped from 153 to 136 in Arians’ first year, and plummeted to 103 by the end of 2014. Yet last season was also a time of hope, when Fitzgerald had begun to find a real trust with Palmer before the Cardinals quarterback was lost to injury. \nClearly, it’s taken some time for Arians to embrace Fitzgerald, and for Fitzgerald to embrace and learn a new way of playing football. He was pushed to discomfort by Arians, just like he was with former offensive coordinator Todd Haley, who once called Fitzgerald a “one-trick pony.” \nYet Fitzgerald persisted then, and he’s prevailing now. He is proof that nobody stops the great ones. And just the other day, Palmer called Fitzgerald the best blocking receiver in football. Never thought I’d hear that. \n\"That's the equivalent of a basketball player saying he's the best screen setter in the game,\" Fitzgerald cracked. \"Twenty years from now, when they talk about my past, I hope they don't say, 'He was one of the best run blockers of his era.'\" Arizona Cardinals offense to find a challenge from Rams \nBut there’s something much greater at work here: The rise of Fitzgerald has enriched this team and its story immensely, taking the energy to another level. You can’t define it. But you can feel it. Everyone can. \n“It's because everyone wants it,” Warner said. “Everybody looks forward to Fitz making one of those plays because he’s synonymous with that. And the buzz when he does something like that carries over much longer than one play. \n“I liken it to Q and Larry back in the day. Anquan would make a play, knock somebody down, run somebody over, and you could feel the guys get bolder. Then Larry would make a one-handed catch and the team would feel invincible, like nobody could stop us. That’s how it feels this year. When Fitz is rolling, with all the other pieces they have, you just feel like they can’t be stopped.” \nFor Fitzgerald, it’s a feeling that’s been a long time coming. Now, it’s like a football in the end zone. You’re going to have wrestle it out of his arms. \nGood luck with that. \nReach Bickley at dan.bickley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8253.
