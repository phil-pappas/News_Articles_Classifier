Many lined up at a handful of shops that opened just after midnight.\n\"I've been looking forward to this day for many years,\" said Mike Coleman, 49, of Southeast Portland, who said he previously obtained marijuana \"from private sources\" but on Thursday waited in line outside of Farma on Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard.\nThe Real Dope Having trouble keeping up with all the developments as Oregon wades deeper into legal marijuana? Sign up for The Real Dope , a weekly newsletter emailed directly to you every Tuesday from The Oregonian/OregonLive. The launch of the recreational market in Oregon was not without bumps. The health authority, which is still ramping up its staff of inspectors, had just one on the ground Thursday.\nThe inspector stopped by five dispensaries and spotted a range of violations. Some had failed to post public health warnings about their products. Others were handing out free marijuana, including cannabis-infused gummy candies.\nProduct giveaways are not allowed on dispensary property, according to state rules.\n\"We have distributed a ton of information and warnings about giveaways,\" said Jonathan Modie, a health authority spokesman who accompanied the inspector on Thursday.\nModie said some dispensaries he visited were checking IDs but did not have a system for making sure the same customer did not return to buy more that day.\nThe state does not require that stores record a customer's name, but they are supposed to prevent the same customer from purchasing more than what's allowed in a single day.\n\"Unless the person checking IDs remembers that person came in before, it's going to be difficult to know that person was already there earlier in the day,\" said Modie.\nNothing in the state's rules keeps consumers from going to other shops to purchase more during the course of a day.\nFrom the consumer's point of view, the day was a success.\nA line of about 50 people lined up outside of Shango in Hillsboro Thursday morning. At 10 a.m., owner Adrian Perte opened the doors, announcing, \"Here we go! Here we go!\"\nThe crowd cheered. Passing motorists honked their horns. Perte said he thought inventory would be sufficient to meet demand.\n\"We have a feeling that we're going to have quite the large crowd in the next few weeks,\" said Perte.\nFoster Buds in Southeast Portland opened at midnight and did brisk business until dawn, said budtender Justin Hames, 26. More than 100 people streamed into the shop in the early morning hours for $15 cannabis plants and dried flowers, which sold for $9 to $15 a gram.\nIn all, the shop sold about a pound of flowers and 20 marijuana plants between midnight and 5 a.m., said Hames.\n\"It's been extremely professional, fun and organized,\" said Hames, as customers browsed jars of flowers. The top selling marijuana strains came with names like: Galactic Jack, Girl Scout Cookies, Blue Dream and Tranquil Elephantize.\nNot everyone saw the day as a cause for celebration.\nLaura Burningham was unhappy to see Calyxes, a marijuana dispensary in Southwest Portland's Multnomah Village neighborhood, operating near her child's preschool.\nShe said she worries about the lack of research on marijuana and its potential health implications. Plus, she said the state hasn't done enough to address marijuana use among young people.\nSaid Burningham: \"We'll just have to be more diligent with our children individually.\"\nWestside Wellness in Beaverton sold nearly a day's worth of marijuana, plants and seeds in the first hour and a half after opening, said co-owner Claudia Lavander.\nBill Roberts, 37, of Forest Grove, was among those in line.\n\"I'm taking my receipt today,\" Roberts said, \"and I'm framing it.\"\nOregonians last year said yes to legalizing marijuana, but the Oregon Liquor Control Commission is not expected to unveil a regulated industry until next year. Since July, marijuana possession has been legal in Oregon. Recreational sales, however, were expected to begin until late next year. But Oregon lawmakers decided to speed up the timetable for recreational sales. They approved a temporary sales program that allows people to make limited purchases from already established dispensaries, which are overseen by the health authority.\nThose businesses may sell up to a quarter-ounce of dried flowers, roughly enough for seven to 12 joints, as well as four starter plants and an unlimited number of seeds to people 21 and older.\nAt Tree House Collective on Northeast Sandy Boulevard, Robert Huff, 52, a photographer, bought two grams of dried flowers.\nA longtime pot smoker, Huff said the ability to legally buy cannabis eased some of the stigma surrounding the drug.\n\"I don't have to feel like I'm doing something wrong that I never really thought was wrong,\" he said.\nHuff, who works near the shop, couldn't resist stepping inside. \"The draw was too much,\" he said. \"I parked and I was like, 'Well, I gotta go over.'\"\nMarijuana activist Anthony Johnson, chief petitioner of Measure 91, bought a gram of the strain, Trainwreck, at Cannabliss & Co. in Southeast Portland.\nHe vowed to save it for posterity.\n\"Hopefully,\" said Johnson, \"it will find its way into a museum someday as a piece of history.\"\nJim Ryan, Anna Marum, Rich Read, Amy Wang, Wendy Owen and Melissa Binder of The Oregonian staff contributed to this report.\n-- Noelle Crombie\n503-276-7184; @noellecrombie", "external_links": ["http://www.oregon.gov/OHA/Pages/index.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:18:19.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
