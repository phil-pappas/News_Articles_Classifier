Despite an improving forecast, it will still take weeks for the state to return to normal after being pummeled by an historic rainstorm. South Carolina had problems with crumbling roads and bridges and old drinking water systems and dams long before the historic floods of the past week. Now the state faces what will likely be hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars of bills to fix washed out roads and bridges and destroyed dams.

Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott on Tuesday asked York County Sheriff Bruce Bryant if he could send resources to assist in the recovery. \nFaris said the seven York County deputies will assist in working patrol shifts. \n“We’ll be answering to whatever Richland County asks us to do,” he said. “They’ve been working around the clock since this whole thing started. Whenever we can give those officers a break so they can get a warm meal and some rest and be sharp for the next day, we’ll do whatever we can to help them out.” \nAt least 19 people have died in South Carolina since the rain began falling last weekend, and residents and first responders are bracing for the possibility of more flooding in the days to come, according to the Associated Press. About 800 people were in two-dozen shelters around the state, and Gov. Nikki Haley said she expects that number to rise.
