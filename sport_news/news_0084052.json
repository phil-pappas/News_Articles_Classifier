Sentiments from the 3,500 or so folks who showed up were all over the place. But one wish was near-unanimous and repeatedly underscored: The legal marketplace for recreational weed, set for full launch in 2016, should be developed and run by Oregonians. Several folks referred to the state's soon-to-expand ranks of pot entrepreneurs as nothing less than Oregon pioneers.\nWell enough. Oregon's pot is frequently celebrated as the best anywhere: The state's bloated medical market occasioned the growth of several potent strains ambitiously developed in uncommonly fecund settings. Local pride naturally followed. But it would be foolishly prideful to shackle a promising, significant expansion of marijuana's marketplace by cutting off the engagement of productive, imaginative folks from beyond Oregon's borders. Oregon's wine industry, for one, profits from immigrants and talents from afar.\nA preliminary draft regulation of a subcommittee of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, charged by the Legislature with regulating recreational marijuana, requires that applicants for a license to sell recreational marijuana be Oregon residents minimally for two years and that recreational marijuana businesses be 51-percent owned by Oregonians. Insisting upon local ownership, however, could complicate efforts by local owners to raise sufficient local private equity – bank loans will be unavailable to the marijuana sector, owing to federal prohibitions on the drug – and potentially undermine efforts to make Oregon's marijuana trade fully transparent, an overriding goal of Measure 91.\nThe OLCC's subcommittee didn't act unreasonably in fashioning the draft rule, however. The Legislature, its ear tuned to the wishes of citizens, wrote the residency requirement into the statute governing marijuana sales and left it to the OLCC to fashion regulations. As OLCC Chair Rob Patridge told the editorial board of The Oregonian/OregonLive this week: \"Lawmakers did put some things into (the statute) ... and we are bound by the law.\"\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms", "external_links": ["http://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/pages/default.aspx", "http://www.oregon.gov/olcc/pages/commissioners.aspx#Commission_Chair_Rob_Patridge"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:35:53.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
