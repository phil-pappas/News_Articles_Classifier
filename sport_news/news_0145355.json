This served as another showing of the complete nature of this team. They didn't run the ball with dominance, but were able to punch it into the end zone four times on the ground. \nThe defense continues to be opportunistic and make plays when necessary. Seems whatever the weakness in the opponent, the Bengals have been able to exploit it through their 4-0 start. Today, it was the Chiefs' struggling offensive line and conservative offense. That meant five sacks for a loss of 38 yards. \nThrough four games, they've only really been faced with one dramatic finish. They've turned the others into foregone conclusions. \nCincinnati now owns a two-game lead in the AFC North, with Seattle coming to town this week. The assessment by John Harbaugh that this is the most talented roster in football looks less and less like conjecture as they cruise into October. \nCincinnati Bengals wide receiver Brandon Tate (19) makes a catch on a pass from quarterback Andy Dalton (not pictured) in the second half against the Kansas City Chiefs at Paul Brown Stadium.

In fact, he's raised his level of play to unprecedented levels. Dalton finished with a passer rating over 100 for the fourth consecutive game. That's the first time in his career he's had a streak of four. When the Bengals had to have a play, he provided it. His continued improvisation skills kept drives going and delivered the offensive play of the day when he broke free of the pocket to toss a dart to a diving Brandon Tate on the run. \nAt one point after he ran for a first down in the fourth quarter, he popped up with a confident point forward. This is the part of the difference in Dalton. The fire and confidence shows on a weekly basis now. No more than today. \nDANCE OF THE GAME \nDomata Peko notched a sack and tackle for loss in the first half. Both were followed by his latest dance. Names for this belly rub rumble are being accepted. Thus far, the Stanky Belly and Samoan Shuffle are leaders in the clubhouse. \nUPON FURTHER REVIEW \nThe Bengals continue to wonder what is and what isn't considered a catch. One week after a Tyler Eifert catch and dive into the end zone were nullified against Baltimore, causing confusion and controversy surrounding the rule league-wide, the Bengals thought they ended up on the other end of the conversation Sunday. A 20-yard reception by Jeremy Maclin was hauled in near the sideline, but after a hit from Reggie Nelson, the ball became dislodged as he hit the ground. The Bengals challenged, but it was still ruled a catch on the field. \nTo say whether the call was correct or not would mean anyone has an understanding of what the heck constitutes a catch in this league anymore. Maclin didn't complete the process of the catch through the ground, so that would seem to mean the call would be incomplete, but the crew of officials disagreed. \nTWEET OF THE GAME \nOn the Jeremy Hill touchdown run at the end of the third quarter, the Chiefs were determined not to let A.J. Green beat them so they rolled out a straight double-team press as if he were a gunner on a punt. Hill ran the other direction for his 5-yard score. \nTHREE KEYS REVISITED \nSlow Down Justin Houston: The Bengals did just that. Houston was rendered almost a non-factor. One week after Elvis Dumervil caused dozens of issues for the Ravens, Cincinnati concocted a plan to take him out of the game. Credit to Andre Smith who spent much of the day across from him. \nMaintain Balance: The Bengals offense threw for 321 yards and ran for 124. They hit quality per play averages on both. Allowed Chiefs to pick their poison. \nTackle in the Secondary: This could have been better on a day receiver ran free in the defensive backfield. Luckily for the Bengals the sure tackling returned in the red zone forcing the Chiefs to settle for seven field goals. \nGAME-CHANGER \nMichael Johnson \nThe biggest play of the game came by virtue of hustle from Johnson tracking down Travis Kelce from behind on third-and-30 deep in KC territory. Even though Kelce was headed into traffic and a certain punt, Johnson dove in and dislodged the ball seconds before Kelce went down. \nIt ended up a fumble scooped up by Reggie Nelson and eventually a 5-yard touchdown run from Jeremy Hill. The 29-15 advantage was one the Chiefs couldn't overcome. \nPaul Dehner Jr. is a columnist for the Cincinnati Enquirer. He can be reached at pdehnerjr@enquirer.com.
