Blame that on a combination of Mother Nature, which has pounded the area with constant rain this last two weeks, and the Cardinals having an open date last week following their 34-12 win at Topsail on Sept. 18. And then there’s another influence outside JHS coach Beau Williams’ control: That Jacksonville’s Coastal 3-A Conference game against West Carteret is in Morehead City. “We tried to get it moved up to Thursday and they couldn’t do it because they had a hall of fame thing that night,” Williams said. “And I would have liked to have played (Saturday), but they said they couldn’t because of the Seafood Festival (Friday through Sunday). They wanted to still play Friday, but once I told them school was released early … we just couldn’t do it. I would have loved to have gotten it (game) done.” That means Jacksonville (2-2, 0-0) will visit West Carteret (0-6, 0-1) on Monday at 6:30 p.m. The Cardinals will turn right back around Friday and visit Richlands for a 7 p.m. kickoff. “It’s been a different year,” Williams said. “We have to make sure nobody gets hurt.” Williams said the Cardinals have still practiced outside, despite the rainy weather. “It’s been business as usual to try to get everything ready,” he said. “There’s not much left we can do but hope we can get it in Monday.” A new first for Morris Chris Morris has experience several firsts as Dixon’s first-year football coach, ranging from his first meeting with his players back in July to the team’s first practice and the Bulldogs’ first win – a 14-13 season-opening victory at First Flight. Morris will have another first this weekend – his first hurricane following his move from Kentucky this summer. And because of Hurricane Joaquin and the rain the storm is expected to give the area this weekend, Morris is having to adjust Dixon’s routine following their 35-0 home win over Kipp Pride on Thursday in a game moved up a day because of the inclement weather concerns. The Bulldogs planned on getting together for their normal Saturday routine of light running and stretching and watching game film Friday, but were unable to do that because Onslow County schools closed two hours early Friday. “We will go Monday like we normally do,\" Morris said. Rain, rain ... we’ll play anyway Unlike many of his coaching brethren, Swansboro coach Tim Laspada doesn’t mind getting all wet on a football Friday night. He certainly would like to play on a nice, dry field, especially with quarterback Eli Frantz having thrown for nearly 800 yards in five games this season, which leads the area. Page 2 of 3 - But if the rain comes, Laspada’s motto is simple: Play on. “This is football,” he said after losing to fifth-ranked and unbeaten West Craven on Thursday night in the rain. “We’re going to play no matter what. That’s what we do, and whether it hurts us or not, we’re not going to make that excuse.” Big win? You bet Croatan’s 27-26 win over East Carteret was big. The Mariners (4-2) had only lost to 1-A power James Kenan and were ranked No. 9 in 1-A in The Associated Press poll. And for Croatan (5-1), it was the Cougars’ fifth straight win and moved them within one win of tying the school record for victories. After a 28-6 loss to 1-A Pamlico in its opener, Croatan had beaten four straight 3-A teams – Richlands, West Carteret, Topsail and Swansboro – and then edging the Mariners heading into its open date before opening East Central 2-A Conference play Oct. 9 at home against North Brunswick. “This obvious was the best team we’ve played,” coach David Perry said. “It’s a huge win for us heading into conference. We’ve got 10 days to get ready for North Brunswick. We’re the hottest team right now in the conference.” Weather? What weather? The field at East Carteret definitely favored a running game, although Mariners’ quarterback Brennan Lewis had no problems passing the ball. But Croatan running back Sam Nay said he and his teammates – and coaches – were confident going into the game, no matter the weather or field conditions. “Rain or shine our coaches all week were, ‘we’re going to shove it down their throat,’” Nay said. “Rain or shine, it’s not going to matter. Our backs got it. Our line knows what we’re doing. rain or shine, it doesn’t matter how slippery it is, we’re going to hit them in the mouth.” Record updates Seven of the area’s 10 teams are at .500 or better, led by Croatan at 5-1. Northside and East Duplin are both 4-2 while Swansboro comes in at 4-3. Southwest (3-3), Dixon (3-3) and Jacksonville (2-2) are at .500. Teams with losing records: White Oak (3-4), Richlands (1-5) and Lejeune (0-5). The longest winning streak for the 10 area teams: five games, owned by Croatan. The Cougars lost their opener 28-8 to 1-A Pamlico and haven’t lost since. Croatan plays host to North Brunswick (3-2) this Friday in the teams’ East Central 2-A Conference opener. Concerned about game Morris said he was worried what playing Kipp Pride a day earlier than scheduled would do to his team. Page 3 of 3 - “Anytime you’re dealing with 14 to 18-year-old boys … anytime you have anything that (changes) their routine, it worries you as a coach,” he said. Go figure Let’s see if we’ve got this right. White Oak gives up 40 points in an 18-point loss at home to county rival Swansboro and two less (38) in an 18-point loss on the road to perennial state power (and unbeaten and second-ranked) Havelock on Thursday night. He said it “It was definitely exhausting,” Nay said after carrying the ball 36 times for 192 yards – and coming off the field for a few plays after throwing up. Briefly Dixon’s 35-0 win over Kipp Pride on Thursday night was the Bulldogs’ first shutout since a 34-0 win over Mattamuskeet on Aug. 24, 2012. The Bulldogs finished 7-4 that season. ... East Duplin has put up 44 points or more in four games this year but also has been shut out twice – by state 1-A power Wallace-Rose Hill (45-0) and James Kenan (28-0). ... Northside has scored 47 points or more in three of six games this year while also suffering one shutout – 43-0 to perennial state 3-A power Havelock.
