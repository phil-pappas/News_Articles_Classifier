They take pride in their defensive philosophy. \n“Our goal is to shutout a team every game,” said South Tama defensive back Cody Kellogg, who intercepted his fifth pass of the season. “Our defense is pretty tough. I think we’re capable of that every game.” \nSouth Tama allowed just 146 total yards and has a gang-tackling approach to stopping the opposition. Only seven plays against the Trojans went for double-digit gains. \n“Our kids play as a unit,” Hoskey said. “They know defense is an 11-man game.” \nBryce Chyma provide all the points the Trojans would need, scoring on a 20-yard run with 7:13 to go in the half and that capped a five-play drive that started on their 45 — their best field position before the break. \nIn the third quarter, Williamsburg pulled even at seven apiece when Derek Greiner picked off a Clayton Rosenberger pass for a 47-yard TD return. \nSouth Tama answered immediately. Chyma capped off the next drive with a 3-yd TD to take the lead for good. Jerry Lowe added a 14-yard score late to ice the game in the fourth. \nThe Trojans were able to pound the ball the entire game. Lowe rushed for 229 yards on 42 carries, playing through a sprained ankle. The Trojans were strong and physical up front. \n“You had to,” Hoskey said. “Each of these teams were pretty even, as far as the skill positions and speed out there, so our advantage we figured coming into this game that we could pound a little b it more.” \nWilliamsburg (5-2) didn’t have much of an answer for the Trojans. Williamsburg Coach Curt Ritchie said it wasn’t due to a lack of effort on their part. \n“Our thought defensively played with a ton of heart,” Ritchie said. “I can’t count out our effort. Our kids played tremendously hard. \n“They took control up front. They handled both sides of the ball.” \nThe Trojans (7-0) have enjoyed success this season, receiving leadership from experienced seniors. They have taking their lumps and are now returning them, looking to make postseason noise. \n“I have about six, seven guys on here that started as sophomores,” Hoskey said. “They took their beatings for a year and then last year we were pretty decent. Now, they’ve been around and know what it takes.” \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:48:09.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
