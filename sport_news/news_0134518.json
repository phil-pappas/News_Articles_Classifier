(Photo: Craig Bailey/FLORIDA TODAY) Buy Photo \nVIERA – A Palm Bay High team that came in with four consecutive wins by an average of 35 points learned for sure that it can win the close ones, too, and by the closest of margins. \nViera’s offense ended deep in the red zone, a pass completed as the final second expired in a 40-35 Pirates road victory. \nPalm Bay had led by three touchdowns at halftime and 12 points with 8:52 to play. It was enough to improve to 5-1 as the Pirates return to District 14-5A play in a week. \n“I’m proud of the way the guys rallied around each other, guys cramping up, some out,” Pirates coach Dan Burke said. “These guys bonded tonight.” \nEveryone contributed on a roster closer to 30 than anyone in red and black would like, not only skill players playing both offense and defense but linemen, too. Running back Brian Landkford-Johnson had another huge night —280 yards this time — exploding through holes created by the line for touchdowns of 14, 50, 15 and 64 yards. \n“We’re just fighters,” Lankford-Johnson said. “It’s not just me. We all can make plays.” \nJared Morris pounded the Viera defense early, and he had a stretch of 2:42 in the second period in which he scored on runs of 5 and 3 yards. In between, he drove Hawks quarterback Hayden Kingston into a teammate who knocked the ball loose and, eventually, into the hands of Morris. \n“I got the quarterback to roll out, and Mitchell Cook caused the fumble,” Morris said. “We were tired out there sometimes, but overall we were good.” \nBig plays were everywhere. Chase Harris catching a 32-yard pass that bounced high in the air in a collision with two defenders. He kept his concentration and took in the ball flat on his back, leading to Lankford-Johnson’s 14-yarder. \nThat possession was set up on a gem delivered by Cook, laying on the ground himself but reaching out to grab the foot of a Viera player who took the snap on a fake punt and appeared to have a chance at a first down. \nHarris made another key catch, this one for 10 yards on a third-and-9 play in which Stuart Brown sprinted to his right and found the receiver to keep a drive going after a Jay Boyd 3-yard run brought the Hawks within 34-28. \nCook combined with Brandon Taylor to sack Kingston in the final minutes, forcing a punt. Ozzie Samuel ran back to cover a short kickoff, the ball live as Hawks charged it in the fourth quarter. \nMORE: Brevard County high school football \nViera, down by 20 with just 5:49 remaining in the third, made its own big plays in the comeback. Kingston on target and his receivers explosive in touchdown passes of 20 yards to Alex Cabrera and 47 to Tre Nixon, the latter with 3:12 to play. \nBrennen Deplancke scored on a 6-yard in the first to give the Hawks their only lead. Kingston scored from the 3 in the third, faking a handoff and running nearly untouched into the end zone to cut it to 34-21. Jay Boyd got Viera within 34-28 at 10:54 of the final quarter on a 3-yard run. \nContact McCallum at 321-242-3698 or bmccallum@floridatoday.com.
