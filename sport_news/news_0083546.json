Bunch once again linked up with Lynch on a 12-yard pass three plays into the Rangers’ fourth possession. By the time the dust had cleared on the offensive flurry, Roland led 34-0 at the end of the first quarter. \nLynch wasn’t done yet. He took the kickoff to open the second half and raced 80 yards for a score, boosting the Roland lead to 54-0. \nFor the game, Lynch caught 6 passes for 149 yards and four scores and ran a kickoff back for a score. \nBunch was 9-11 passing for 215 yards and five scores and ran once for 15 yards and another TD. \nRoland (6-1, 3-0) gets back in action next Friday at Stigler. \nHeavener (2-5, 1-3) hosts Spiro on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:49:52.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
