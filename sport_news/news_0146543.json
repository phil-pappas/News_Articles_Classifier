The team announced Sunday morning that first-base coach Arnie Beyeler would not be retained for 2016. Informed of the decision on Saturday night, Beyeler coached first for the Red Sox on Sunday. He also brought out the lineup card. \"I just really wanted to change a little bit of the mixture on [the coaching staff],\" president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said. \" I feel in Arnie’s case, he’s done a great job in so many ways. He took the news as well as you possibly can. He’s a good person. He’s worked hard. He’s been a Red Sox person. We just wanted to make a change on the staff in a direction, and that's the one we decided to go on.\" \"Arnie has been so dedicated, so loyal, and is one of the hardest-working coaches that I've ever been around,\" said. \"He spends so much time watching video, positioning guys. He does a great job with their footwork and fundamental and getting them out there and drilling them. He also does a great job controlling our running game. \"I'm sorry to see him move on, sorry to see that decision, but as we all know in this game, things change quickly and there's reasons for a change. Arnie will be just fine. He'll land on his feet again. He's a very qualified coach.\" Beyeler was disappointed but understanding of the decision. \"I was disappointed without a doubt, but that said, I have nothing but good things to say about these guys,\" said Beyeler, who has been with the Red Sox organization for nine seasons. \"To get a chance to bring me up here on the big-league staff was a dream come true. I had a nice ride out of that.\" It's hard not to see Beyeler as a kind of scapegoat for the failure of Hanley Ramirez to take to left field. Boston's outfield coordinator, Beyeler oversaw Ramirez's disastrous conversion to left. He was also criticized by Yoenis Cespedes after the outfielder was traded to Detroit last offseason. At the same time, Beyeler was the man in charge when Brock Holt and Mookie Betts transitioned seamlessly to the outfield. \"I can look in the mirror walking out of here and I did the best I could do while I was here,\" Beyeler said. \"When you finish in last place, things can change, guys get moved, people get fired. That’s the nature of the business.\" Beyeler said he did not believe the problems with Ramirez were the deciding factor in the organization's decision to move on. \"I didn’t get that feeling at all,\" he said. \"[Dombrowski] just said they needed to make a change. My spot was the one that they decided to change. I’ve been in this situation before and something good came out of it.\" Page 2 of 2 - Beyeler had been on the major-league staff for three seasons. Prior to that, he had managed for six years in the system — four of them in Portland and two in Pawtucket. He won the Governors' Cup in 2012 with the PawSox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:32:44.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
