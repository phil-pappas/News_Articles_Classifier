(Matt Smith | For lehighvalleylive.com) By Brad Wilson | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 02, 2015 7:00 AM, updated October 02, 2015 2:15 PM View/Post Comments \nHow does a gifted running back like Northwestern Lehigh’s Harry Hall change the game around him? \nAs the Tigers are set to visit Saucon Valley tonight (7) in a critical Colonial League football matchup, here’s seven ways Hall impacts a defense. \nVision with the ball. “We haven’t seen a running back with his vision,” Saucon Valley coach Matt Evancho said. “He’s very patient with his blockers, and he follows them extremely well.” \nQuickie cutbacks. This is related to vision, but defenses can’t be overly aggressive with Hall; give him a cutback lane, and poof, he’s gone. “We absolutely must be disciplined,” Evancho said. “We cannot overpursue.” \nTackling must be sharp. “The No. 1 thing with Hall is no arm tackles,” Panther linebacker Mike Paolini said. “He’ll break through those pretty easily.” In preparation for Hall, Evancho said Saucon Valley tackled more this week. “We can’t be reaching to tackle him,” Evancho said. “We have to get into his legs and body and bring him to the ground.” Of course every minute spent on tackling is a minute not spent on something else such as ... \nPlay-action passes. “Almost everything we do passing is off the play fake because with Harry defenses have to respect him,” Northwestern coach Josh Snyder said. It also allows the Tigers to make a plus out of a necessity. “We like to play fake and move our quarterback, Dylan Snyder , because at 5-7 he can’t see over the pocket, so we get him moving and he throws well on the move.\" Related to this … \nTigers’ dangerous quick screens. Northwestern’s quick passes to the perimeter can be extremely effective and even if they rarely involve Hall, his running, as Snyder said, sets the screens up. “It’s all based on the run,” Snyder said. Without Hall, those plays would be less effective. \nSheer speed. Teams must contain Hall because if they don’t he can go the distance from anywhere. “In track Harry beat me in the 100-meter dash,” said Saucon Valley defensive back Zach Thatcher. “He has the power to run you over, too. I just have to hope I am faster than him in pads.” \nCreating a challenge. A veteran defense like Saucon Valley’s loves a challenge like containing Hall. “Preparing for Hall brings out the best in all of us,” Paolini said. “It makes us do our best in practice.” \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
