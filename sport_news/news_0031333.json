He then missed two straight field goals against the Razorbacks — one from 25 yards and another from 48 — before bouncing back with a 35-yard make in the fourth quarter. \nRELATED: Field goal kicking remains a problem for Alabama \n\"You have to be able to take it to the game,\" Saban said, \"by focusing on the very things that allow you to have the success in practice that you have.\" \nGriffith has made just 56 percent of his field goal attempts during his Alabama career (19 of 34), including just 6 of 12 this year. \n\"Mentally, you have to have a positive attitude about what you're doing,\" Saban said. \"You have to believe in it. You have to trust it. You have to think about 'What does it take to make this kick?' And not think about 'What's going to happen if I miss?' I think a lot of that is eliminating the negatives and focusing on the process of what you have to do to be consistent in what you're doing.\" Alabama Beat Reporter Show, Oct. 12, 2015 Alabama beat reporters John Talty and Matt Zenitz discuss the twitter report that Arkansas head coach Bret Beilema feigned bump from Alabama offensive lineman Cam Robinson then celebrated the resulting flag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:23:12.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
