Vargus had 13 carries for 161 yards and three touchdowns as East Bridgewater (6-0) won a non-league battle of undefeated teams with a 37-14 victory over visiting Dighton-Rehoboth Friday night. After forcing Dighton-Rehoboth (5-1) to punt on the game’s first possession, Vargus went to work. A 25-yard run by Vargus and a 14-yard completion from Ryan Graham to Greg Plunkett set up the Vikings at the Falcons 4. Vargus capped the drive with a 4-yard touchdown run and a David Trask extra point gave EB a 7-0 lead. Dighton-Rehoboth was forced to punt on its next possession, but East Bridgewater’s Adam Carr blocked the punt and Mike Khoury returned it 27 yards to the Falcons 23. On play later, Graham hit Plunkett for a 23-yard touchdown pass and a 14-0 lead 41 seconds left in the first quarter. The Falcons responded on their next drive when Jake Salera took and handoff from quarterback Cam Reed and raced 64 yards to the end zone for a touchdown to cut the deficit to 14-7. That would be as close as the Falcons would get as the Vikings turned to Vargus. Vargus ripped off a 50-yard run to set up his second touchdown on a 4-yard run for a 21-7 lead just over a minute into the second quarter. Dighton-Rehoboth turned the ball over on downs at the East Bridgewater 43 and Vikings quickly found the end zone again. After a 13-yard completion from Graham to Plunkett, Vargus went 44 yards on the next play for his third touchdown of the game and a 27-7 lead with 4:48 left in the first half. East Bridgewater picked up in the second half where they left off in the first. The Vikings increased their lead to 34-7 when Graham (4-for-8, 100 yards and two touchdowns) connected with Jake Peterson for a 50-yard touchdown pass on third and long. Trask booted his fourth extra point with just over four minutes gone in the quarter. Dighton-Rehoboth quarterback Cam Reed scored on a 1-yard keeper with seven seconds left in the third quarter to cut the deficit to 34-14. Trask closed out the scoring for East Bridgewater with 2:22 left in the game with a 28-yard field goal.
