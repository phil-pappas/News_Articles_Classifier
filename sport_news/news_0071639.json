It was a wonder goal that beat us. Then the second half, we put them under pressure. I don’t think they troubled us once the second half. I am really proud of the way we fought back in the second half. It was definitely a complete turnaround from Friday.” \nWashburn (2-6-2, 1-3-0 MIAA), put some pressure on the RiverHawks in the second half, outshooting Northeastern State 6-3. Jordan Woodruff posted the shutout for NSU (8-2, 3-1). \n“When we had the opportunities, we were right there, the ball just didn’t bounce the right way or we were one second too late or one second too early,” Jones said. “We’ll correct that.” \nWashburn put up seven shots, with Rachel Kuhlanek, Cadence Bourne and Morgan El-Attrache attempting two apiece. \nKaitlin Minnich recorded two saves in goal for the Ichabods. \nCudjoe’s goal was one of the few opportunities Washburn allowed, leaving Jones satisfied with WU’s defensive effort. \n“We high-pressured them and kept them basically in their half most of the game,” Jones said. “We were really organized defensively, and we were organized when we had the ball. It’s just finding that final decision.” \nWashburn will continue a four-game homestand against Missouri Western at 6 p.m. Friday. \nNortheastern State 1 0 — 1 \nWashburn 0 0 — 0 \nNortheastern State — Goal: Cudjoe. Shutout: Woodruff. \nRecords — Northeastern State: 8-2, 3-1 MIAA. Washburn 2-6-2, 1-3 MIAA. \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:53:40.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
