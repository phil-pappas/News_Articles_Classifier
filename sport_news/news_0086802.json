It’s just tough to deal with. People just don’t understand.’’\n“I get it as a fan. You’re a fan of a player, you never want to see someone get hurt, especially when you have a whole nation behind you.\n“But my slide was not dirty, and it’s completely legal. So I have no remorse over the slide. I just wish he hadn’t gotten hurt. I wish he would have jumped over me or gotten out of the way.’’\nThe Pirates, and Kang himself, refused to blame Coghlan, saying it was a hard-nosed play.\nUSA TODAY\nMets turn to Plan B: Wilmer Flores replaces Ruben Tejada\nMajor League Baseball would rather Utley not show up – chief baseball officer Joe Torre suspended Utley for Games 3 and 4, calling it a violation of the major league rule that prohibits “this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.”\nThe Mets certainly agree, although Utley is appealing his suspension and could still play in New York.\n“It was dirty,” Mets infielder Kelly Johnson said. “There are so many things wrong with that play. Our starting shortstop is out of the playoffs with a broken leg. …I want a rule about a guy going into Ruben like that. We don’t have a rule about that slide, or whatever that was, that tackle.\n“It’s sad. I don’t get it, I really don’t.’’\nTejada never had a chance. In the eighth inning of Game 2 of their Division Series game at Dodger Stadium, he took the flip from second baseman Daniel Murphy for what was supposed to be one out. When he turned his back, Utley steamrolled into him, starting his slide well past second base. Tejada flopped in the air, screamed, and when he came down, had no feeling in his leg.\nFractured right fibula.\nThe Mets called it dirty. The Dodgers say it was simply being aggressive.\nThe Mets called it reckless. The Dodgers say it’s old-school.\nThere’s a faction of the baseball fraternity saying he should be immediately suspended. There’s another faction congratulating him for playing the game as hard as anyone who put on a uniform.\nYou make the call.\n“I don’t know how much could be been done to prevent it,’’ Cubs veteran pitcher Dan Haren said, “but I definitely think the slide was late. I played against Chase for 12 years, and he plays the game hard. Sometimes, almost to the extreme.\n“You can’t prove he was trying to hurt him, but Utley has the reputation of going pretty hard to second. He does little things throughout games where he’ll block the base with his legs when people try to slide in.\n“We all know he plays the game hard. Maybe too hard.’’\nUSA TODAY\nMatt Harvey has chance to avenge Mets vs. Chase Utley, Dodgers\nWhen Coghlan broke Kang’s leg with his slide three weeks ago, the Pirates actually understood, refusing to fault Coghlan. He did the same thing during his rookie season in 2009 while playing with the Miami Marlins, sliding into Tampa Bay Rays second baseman Akinori Iwamura, who suffered a torn ACL. Iwamura was never again the same, and out of baseball in a year.\n“I never cried about that,’’ said Cubs manager Joe Maddon, who was managing the Rays at the time. “It happens. Listen, everybody wants to put everybody in a bubble anymore.\n“I mean, my God, I’m really not into that. I don’t like the knee jerk overreaction to anything. Utilize the rules that are in play, but don’t overreact to that one play.’’\nMaddon never offered an opinion on whether he believed Utley’s slide was dirty, or clean, but believes it was within the rules.\nIf you want to know the truth, Maddon believes the Buster Posey Rule should go away, too. Home-plate collisions have been prohibited the last two years after Posey, the San Francisco Giants’ All-Star catcher, broke his left leg and suffered three torn ligaments when Marlins outfielder Scott Cousins bowled him over in 2011.\n“I hate it,’’ Maddon said. “I don’t like it at all. I think the rule at the plate is ridiculous. That needs to go away.\n“It was one play, and it was based on bad technique, that’s why the catcher got hurt. It’s like this one. It was only one play. When one situation occurs, we overreact to it. I’d rather not.\n“I’m not defending the slide, but it was an awkward situation. If you want to legislate anything, make it like an NBA flagrant foul, where there would have to be a flagrant component to it.’’\nCertainly, if such a rule existed, Utley would have more flagrant fouls in his career than Dennis Rodman. It’s just how he plays. It defines the man.\nUtley has had a wonderful 13-year career, and will be revered in Philadelphia for helping the Phillies win the 2008 World Series, but to many fanas, all he’ll be remembered for will be Saturday night.\nUSA TODAY\nNightengale: The Chase Utley Rule is inevitable, and not a moment too soon\nHe will be savaged Monday night in New York during the player introductions for Game 3, and should be the most hated visiting player since John Rocker was reviled for his racist comments about New Yorkers. He’ll need extra security at the stadium, just like Rocker did in 1999, or even former Toronto Blue Jays catcher Ken Huckaby, whose third-base collision in 2003 separated Yankees icon Derek Jeter’s shoulder.\nGo ahead, ask Cousins how it feels living in San Francisco, and remembered only as the man who ruined Posey’s season, and whose hit incited a dramatic rule change.\n“I felt so bad for Cousins because he got blown up,’’ said Coghlan, who was on deck at the time of the collision. “He got all of these death threats, and all of these things that people never hear about. Cousins never tried to hurt him. It was a completely clean play, but people in San Francisco hated him. Nobody’s malicious, or trying to hurt somebody.\n“Chase is a gamer, and plays really hard. You can question whether it was borderline dirty or not, but that his style.\n“I don’t believe that (Utley) tried to hurt him. It’s completely within the rules. If it’s within the rules, what are you going to do?’’\nStill, you’ll find no sympathy in New York, and for every player that believes that Utley’s slide was absolutely dirty, another will say that it was clean, only ultra-aggressive.\nThere’s no cop in New York who can stop the Mets from their own vigilante plan. You could see them drilling Utley in the ribs at the plate, or sliding as hard as they can into second base, regardless of who the middle infielder may be.\nA hard slide from a Dodgers base runner broke the leg of the New York Mets' shortstop, and the teams disagree if the play crossed the line. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\nIt’s going to get nasty, and baseball better change their rules this winter, making sure we never see anything like this again.\nWe love aggression, yet, when you’re talking about player’s livelihoods, and potentially ruining careers, permitting beanball wars make more sense than what’s happening now.\nIn the batter’s box, at least you’re wearing a helmet.\n“It’s the topic of the day,’’ Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. “We talked about it. We’re not allowed to slide into the catcher or run over the catcher with gear on, but guys can almost tackle a shortstop or second baseman.\n“It’s crazy.’’\nYou can be assured that changing the rule will be the hot topic of conversation in November at the General Manager’s meetings in Boca Raton, Fla., negotiated by the owners and union, and by start of the 2016 season, it will be implemented forever.\nIt makes no sense to change the rules to protect catchers, and not do it for middle infielders - you know, the ones not wearing shin guards and a mask.\n“It was pretty late (slide) for me,,’’ said Cubs veteran catcher David Ross. “I definitely think (MLB) will be on top of this. And I think will happen fast.’’\nMaybe, not soon enough.\n“I think in the postseason,’’ Cubs shortstop Addison Russell said, “it’s only going to get worse. I wouldn’t even be surprised if there’s a slide that looks worse than that.’’\nYet, even as a 21-year-old rookie with a promising career in front of him, Russell adamantly says there’s no need for a rule change. He even called Utley’s play clean, saying it’s the infielder’s job to get out of the way of baserunners.\n“Hey, it’s baseball,’’ he said.\nOnly to soon look a little different, thanks to the Chase Utley rule.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/playoffs/2015/10/11/matt-harvey-new-york-ny-mets-los-angeles-la-dodgers-nlds-postseason-game-3-chase-utley-ruben-tejada/73791540/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06788e73582fd7b9c17507df2638eec083166849/c=254-0-3534-3280/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801629963843207-USP-MLB-NLDS-New-York-Mets-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers-003.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/95a8289b793d7281b4f4a0eaccd2583bfc184620/c=510-0-2548-2038/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801828215607069-USATSI-8794553.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/mlb/2015/10/11/73778880/", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4550490342001_thumb-newslook895324.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/10/11/mets-turn-plan-b-wilmer-flores-replaces-ruben-tejada-nlds-dodgers/73788442/", "http://usat.ly/1RBgyYI", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4550490342001_thumb-newslook895324.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4550490342001_thumb-newslook895324.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/10/11/chase-utley-rule-slides-mlb-ruben-tejada/73775582/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7052dedde644d5f826e7696a6e310e19cd57bb58/c=0-0-2628-2628/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801859732408657-USP-MLB-NLDS-NEW-YORK-METS-AT-LOS-ANGELES-DODGERS-76584186.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:04:23.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
