Coach Brian White does not preach revenge but said the team never forgot how it got knocked around during a 21-0 loss to Liberty in 2014.\n“We talked about that all week long because they physically pounded us,” White said. “That was as sound a defeat as we’ve had in a long time. Being physical, that’s our style.”\nWhite said it also helped that Liberty senior quarterback Alex Lando did not play because of an injured right throwing shoulder he suffered last week against Westland. Senior Corbin Rapier started.\nFew quarterbacks could have mounted much against Davidson, especially after it took a 12-0 lead on 16- and 15-play touchdown drives on its first two possessions. The Wildcats converted four third downs on the first drive. Ryan Royer scored on a 2-yard run.\nRoyer, who ran for 143 yards on 30 carries, said the players were determined to make up for last season’s loss.\n“I remember they were so much more physical than us,” he said. “They dominated us. We couldn’t get anything going offensively, defensively and on special teams. We had the mind-set that we wanted to win so badly. Hilliard Davidson football is hard-nosed.”\nOn their second possession, the Wildcats converted on fourth-and-1 at their 18-yard line on a 3-yard run by Royer. Two third downs also were converted before quarterback Jack Klein ran for a 1-yard touchdown.\nDavidson’s defense never let the Patriots (6-2, 3-2) get into any kind of rhythm. It held on downs at its 15 and 35 in the second quarter, its 32 in the third quarter and at midfield in the fourth.\nDefensive lineman Dylan Day was in the middle of things with two sacks and by falling on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown after a snap went over Rapier’s head.\n“We just tried to get after them with our front four,” Day said. “We wanted to stop the running game first because that got them struggling off the bat. Getting stops gets our offense going. It keeps the ball out of their hands.”\nThe outcome was all but sealed after defensive back Tyler Lomphoy made a diving interception at the Liberty 12-yard line with 1:52 left in the third quarter.\nThree plays later, Royer scored on a 7-yard run around right end to make it 19-0.\nOffensive lineman Kyle Bessen said the players are playing for one another.\n“We’d do anything for each other,” he said. “We’ve developed chemistry. We’re always around each other. We’re playing as a unit. We’re coming together.”\nmznidar@dispatch.com\n@MarkZnidar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:22:10.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
