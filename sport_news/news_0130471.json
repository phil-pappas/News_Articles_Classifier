They say teams’ windows close after a while. We’ve been close, but we’ve always been missing something.\n“But if I had to guess what a championship team is — since I haven’t experienced that — I would guess the makeup we have on this team is the type of makeup that you need.”\nLast season, the Caps had a 101-point campaign. In the playoffs, they won a tough, seven-game first-round series against the Islanders. They then claimed a 3-1 series lead vs. the Rangers — only to lose the final three games, including Game 7 in overtime, to be eliminated.\nIt may have been a valuable part of the learning process. The Caps, having added veteran forwards T.J. Oshie and Justin Williams, believe they’re more ready than ever to compete for the Stanley Cup.\n“We think it’s the right time,” said vastly underrated goaltender Braden Holtby, who shut out the Bruins in all three games last season.\n“Maybe a few years ago our group was still a little bit naive, and we wouldn’t have bought in (to Trotz’ message) as easily as we did last year. Last year, we were all ready for it. It was time for us to grow up as a team. Barry was the guy to teach us how. Obviously it was just one year, and we still have a lot to do in order to reach that full potential of what our team can be.\n“But having a guy like Barry there brings an automatic sense of commitment and accountability. That’s exactly what our team needs. Every team does to be successful. You have to wake up in a lot of ways and learn from experience.”\nIn an earlier NHL era, Wayne Gretzky’s Edmonton Oilers were maybe the most talented team ever assembled. But the Oilers didn’t become a championship team until after they were swept in 1983 by the New York Islanders. They learned that playoff hockey isn’t only about skill.\nThe Caps have been trying to learn the same lesson.\nSaid Holtby: “A playoff game isn’t based around skill so much — well, maybe it is now more than it used to be — but at the same time, you’ve got to block shots, you’ve got to forecheck hard, you’ve got to set up the game right. You know, road game, grind the other team as hard as you can in the first period, don’t worry about scoring goals. There are the kinds of things we began to learn last year.”\nFor years, of course, under an array of coaches, the Caps were a one-dimensional team — taking their identity from Ovechkin, a super talent but not well-acquainted with the defensive zone. Now this is a sound all-round club, which plays with skill, but also heaviness and grit.\n“The Washington Capitals have always had those great skill players, who are going to make great plays and fill the net,” tough winger Tom Wilson said. “The last couple of years we’ve had really good depth with guys who can make plays, but also guys who are big and heavy and can make other teams pay.\n“We want to be a team that’s hard to play against. When you’re a skill-based team and you’re not playing the right way, teams can come in and feel like they didn’t really have to work too hard for it. We want to make sure teams come into our building and have a really hard game.\n“I think the greatest thing is that we have the skill. We have some of the greatest players in the world in this locker room. We just need to work on playing the right way — playing as a team, and playing with a team identity of being heavy and making it hard on other teams to come into the Verizon Center or even play us at their home rink.”\nThe Bruins can certainly attest to how difficult it is to play the Caps and Holtby. This may be the year the rest of the NHL knows it, too.\nThis week’s B’s timeline\nTomorrow vs. Tampa Bay, 1:05 p.m. — The Bruins split last season with the Stanley Cup finalists, winning their first two meetings, but then suffering costly losses in the last two — points that could have gotten the B’s into the playoffs. Watch for talented 20-year-old Jonathan Druin, the left winger on a line centered by Steve Stamkos.\nWednesday at Colorado, 10:05 p.m. — The Bruins met the Avalanche twice last season, with a regulation loss and an overtime setback. The Avalanche, though, were maybe the most disappointing team in the NHL, dropping from 112 points to 90. Ex-Bruin Carl Soderberg is now with the Avs.\nSaturday at Arizona , 10:05 p.m. — The B’s handled the lowly Coyotes in both encounters last season. Phoenix had just 56 points a year ago. Rookie left winger Max Domi, 20, is a kid to watch.\nCHALLENGING TIMES BEHIND THE BENCH\nToronto’s Mike Babcock became the first coach to invoke the NHL’s new coaching challenge rule, which allows coaches to request a video review of goals on which there may have been offside violation or goaltender interference. Babcock questioned a goal by Montreal’s Jeff Petry Wednesday, claiming Canadien Tomas Plekanec interfered with Leafs goalie Jonathan Bernier by poking his stick into his face.\nThe refs consulted a video tablet at rinkside and agreed with Babcock: The goal was disallowed.\nCoaches can make these challenges only if they have their timeout remaining. In winning the challenge, Babcock retained his timeout.\nAn element that coaches must consider is that a timeout may not be wise after an icing call against their team in order to change players. Teams may just have to stick with tired guys for the ensuing faceoff in their end — because if the timeout is used, it will not be available later to question a possible decisive goal-against.\nBruins coach Claude Julien questioned whether coaches will be willing to use the challenge for an icing call, when it might prevent disputing a goal later in the game.\n“I would say from my perspective, a lot of times I’m going to have to bite my bottom lip and hope that we can get the puck out (after an icing) and get a change, vs. using that timeout and losing the challenge,” he said. “It’s called a challenge, and I think it’s a challenge for us, as well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:43:52.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
