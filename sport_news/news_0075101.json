Rather, the U.S. Soccer Federation shared video clips that it produced. \nTranscribed excerpts: \nHe tried putting a positive spin on the CONCACAF Cup setback last weekend at the Rose Bowl, saying it offered long-term benefits. \n“As a team, everyone is growing far more when things go the wrong direction than when things go well. When you have a couple of tough results, you have a couple of defeats that are bitter to swallow, that is when a team is really becoming a team. That is when players start to stick together. That is when players and coaches start to solve problems and have discussions internally how to move things in the positive direction again. So going through tough times is teaching you far more than going through good times.” \nOn the long-term aims, he pointed to the World Cup. \n“It’s always difficult in a negative moment to talk about the bigger picture, but it’s important to keep the bigger picture in mind. The bigger picture is Russia 2018. So every competition [World Cup qualifying, 2016 Copa America, 2017 Gold Cup, friendlies] is there to build toward Russia. That means to break in younger players, to help them to grow and get through growing pains. It means to build new chemistry, new leadership, and to fine-tune a lot of things over a couple of years. We’ll go through ups in that period and we’ll go down sometimes, like right now, but we all do that as a team.” \nAs for those downs, like after the Mexico loss, he cited a weather analogy … \n“We take those results, we take the [criticism] — me especially as a coach, you get it all over the place right now. But you stand up in front of your team and tell them, ‘Listen, there’s not only sunshine.’ We’re going to refocus and we can’t wait to be in St. Louis [Nov. 13 vs. St. Vincent and the Grenadines] in front of our crowd and get the first three points in World Cup qualifying.” \nReader thoughts welcome in the comments section … \nSteven Goff is The Post’s soccer writer.
