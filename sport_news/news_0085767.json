(AP) â€” Lorenzo Cain sprinted home from first base on Eric Hosmer's single in the eighth inning, Wade Davis weathered a 45-minute rain delay and a white-knuckle ninth, and the Kansas City Royals beat the Toronto Blue Jays 4-3 Friday night to earn their second straight trip to the World Series. \nThe victory in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series sent the Royals into the World Series, starting Tuesday night at home against the New York Mets. \nAfter the delay, Cain promptly worked a leadoff walk from closer Roberto Osuna, and Hosmer followed with a clean single that Bautista fielded down the right-field line. \nRather than hit the cutoff man, though, Bautista threw to second to keep Hosmer to a single. That gave the speedy Cain, running full speed the entire way, enough time to beat the relay throw from second base with a textbook slide that ignited a sellout crowd. \nDavis retired Josh Donaldson on a grounder with runners on second and third to end it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:16:26.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
