FOOTBALL: Shippensburg claims Little Brown Jug with 41-13 win over Big Spring \nBy Shawn Michael \nFor GameTimePA.com Posted: 10/23/2015 11:41:05 PM EDT \nSHIPPENSBURG &GT;&GT; It's very possible that the Shippensburg football team played its best game of the season on Friday night. \nAnd it picked the perfect time to do it. \nIn a matchup against Mid Penn Colonial Division rival Big Spring for the Little Brown Jug, the Greyhounds controlled the game from the opening kickoff and rolled to a 41-13 win over the Bulldogs. \n\"We were so fired up in the locker room for this game,\" Ship senior Cole Friese said. \"I think this was by far one of the best games we've played. We weren't going to lose this one.\" Shippensburg's Cole Friese catches a big pass over the middle against Big Spring during the Little Brown Jug rivalry game on Friday.

On the opening kickoff, Adam Houser took the return 90 yards for a touchdown to put Big Spring (4-4, 1-3 MPC) in a 7-0 hole. \nThen after a Bulldog punt, Ship capitalized on two Big Spring personal foul penalties, and Tyler Gustafson hit Wade Mills for a 10-yard touchdown to make it 13-0 halfway through the first quarter. \n\"We did some things tonight and had a lot of success,\" Ship coach Eric Foust said. \"I think we're really starting to hit our stride, and we came into the game really focused.\" \nThe Bulldogs, who were without top running back Tristan Robb, couldn't get much of anything going on offense. They totaled just 202 yards with all but 20 coming on the ground.

The kids played hard and gave it all they got.\" \nBig Spring controlled the ball for much of the second quarter. Sandwiched around a Nathaniel Sheffield touchdown run by Ship, the Bulldogs hit a pair of field goals, with the second one coming with 12 seconds left in the half. \nBut with time for one more play, the Hounds came through with the dagger. Gustafson hit Mills on a screen pass to the left side, and Mills broke one tackle and went untouched the rest of the way for a 70-yard score at the halftime buzzer. He finished with 94 yards on three catches with two touchdowns. \n\"We've been working on that play for a while now, and it worked for us tonight,\" Mills said. \"It was just a play to see what would happen, and we broke off a big one.\" \nThe rest of the game belonged to Friese and the defense. \nFriese led the team in yards from scrimmage, finishing with 79 yards on the ground and another 74 receiving. Defensively, Shippensburg forced three three-and-outs in the second half and didn't allow the Bulldogs to score until their final drive of the game.

(Ryan Blackwell — GameTimePA.com) \nFriese said, \"Every time I got the ball, I just wanted to run as hard as possible.\" \nSheffield said, \"I think we just got really hyped for this game, and this was the first game we really played as brothers.\" \nThe Greyhounds, who had the final spot in the District 3 Class AAA rankings at 16 coming into the game, will focus on securing a spot in the playoffs. That starts with avoiding a letdown against James Buchanan, like they did last year. \nFoust, \"I think last year may actually help us for this game, but we have to come ready to play. We have to keep improving to win these last two.\" \nNOTES &GT;&GT; Adam Houser had a 21-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, and Friese capped off the scoring with a 34-yard dash in the fourth ... Big Spring (2) and Shippensburg (1) were called for a combined three personal foul calls early in the game.
