The development has cleared the decks for the issuance of a no-objection certificate (NOC) by the UT Estate Office, which is required for opening the multiplex. The case was decided by the quasi judicial court of Sarvjit Singh, Chief Administrator-cum-Finance Secretary, after hearing an appeal filed by the promoter of the multiplex. For the past seven years, the UT had held up the completion certificate on different counts — building violations, restoring the façade as per the heritage guidelines and seeking environment clearances. Earlier, the Chandigarh Heritage Committee had directed the management of the mall to give the facade a concrete finish by coating the exterior of the building with fresh concrete. Accordingly, the promoter had restored the original concrete finish. Amit Batra, a senior official of the TDI Group, said they were hopeful of starting the mall soon. Last year, the Urban Planning Department of the UT had asked the Fire Department to issue an NOC on the basis that the building was under the “architect frame control” of Le Corbusier and it was not mandatory for any old building of the city to have a clear passage for the movement of fire tenders around the premises. While rejecting the suggestion, the Fire Department had replied that the mall was not covered under the “architect frame control” of Le Corbusier since it was constructed recently and it could not get the relaxation. During an inspection, a team of the Fire Department had pointed out non-availability of provision for a 6 m thorough passage around the building to have free access for fire tenders in case of a fire. Fire tenders, weighing up to 45 tonnes, could not gain access to the building due to non-availability of open space. Referring to the National Building Code of India, officials stated that it was mandatory to have a 6-m-wide open space on all sides of the building. However, later the NOC was issued subject to certain conditions. Penalty issue under consideration\nSources said the case of charging penalty for building violations/misuse from the date of issue of the show-cause notice was still undecided. The issue of revising the misuse /building violation charges was under consideration. The Estate Office had calculated a penalty of around Rs 36 crore and the case is pending with it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:08:14.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
