By Mark Znidar The Columbus Dispatch • Friday October 9, 2015 5:00 AM \nAge: 17 \nGrade-point average: 3.3 \nSport: Golf \nCollege choices : Has been offered scholarship aid from Longwood (Va.) to play golf and has received interest from Toledo. He also has visited Bowling Green and Florida Southern. Interested in business administration \nQuestion: How did you win the Division I sectional individual championship? \nAnswer: I shot a 1-under-par 71 at Clover Valley. The conditions were perfect. I had it to 2-under going into the final nine holes. It meant a lot to win. My coach (Jeff Olson) said he won the sectional his senior year and that he didn’t want to have that on me. He played at Dublin Coffman. \nQ: How was it to play in the state tournament? \nA: I made it as an individual my sophomore year. That was exciting seeing hundreds of people on the course watching. I was eighth after the first round. The second day, the wind and rain got to me and finished 28th. I thought I was calm. You always want to get the tee shot and the first putt on the first hole over with. \nQ: What else is going on in your life? \nA: My sister, Katie, has Down syndrome. She plays in the Miracle League Baseball in Dublin on a rubberized field, and I help out. Every player has a teenager aiding with batting and running the bases. Katie will turn 12 on Friday. She is in sixth grade. She is going to a camp in two or three weeks. I’m going and she’s excited for me to meet all of her friends. Katie has helped me so much in life. We’re also going to be in the Buddy Walk. We’ll go around Crew Stadium in a group and try to raise money for Down syndrome. You meet a lot of people. It’s a lot of fun. Jordan Spieth, the No. 1 player in the world, has a sister with Down syndrome. \nQ: What else do you do? \nA: I work at Oak Haven Golf Course. I set up tables for outings and park carts. I’ve been doing this since seventh grade. That’s my home course 24-7 during the summer. But I started playing at Mill Creek where Ben Curtis grew up. My second mom — Nancy, the aunt of Ben Curtis — had me over for dinner all of the time. I also spent a lot of nights there. Nancy is my friend Dan’s grandmother. \nQ: It sounds like you got started early in the game. \nA: My dad, John, put a club in my hands when I was 2 years old. I didn’t really get into it until the sixth grade. The next year, I played in a lot of large tournaments. \nQ: Tell us about your parents? \nA: My dad teaches health at Marion Harding and my mom, Diane, teaches sixth grade English in the Olentangy school system. \nQ: What’s it like being the son of educators? \nA: It always has been homework first and everything else second. I have a reading comprehension problem. I used to be four or five grades behind in reading. I have come a long way. I get more time to complete tests. My parents sent me to Ohio State for reading classes, and those have helped a lot. We just read The Kite Runner in my English class. It took me an hour to read one chapter. I wound up listening to it on YouTube and cut the time in half. \nQ: Your goal is professional golf? \nA: I want to get a degree first because I want a backup plan. I do have a good understanding of what it will take to become a pro golfer. Coach Olson played in the PGA championship (at Whistling Straits) this summer. He’s the pro at the Golf Club of Dublin and I’ve picked his brain on what it takes to get that far. I have a friend, T.T. Crouch of Mount Vernon, trying to get through qualifying school. He just graduated from Florida Southern. I talk to him a lot for advice. I love golf — it’s my passion. I’m going to take that road. \nQ: You must love to practice. \nA: I’ve been known to be out there 12 to 13 hours a day. You have to be patient and trust the process. \nQ: Have you ever played a famous course? \nA: I just played Torrey Pines in San Diego. That’s where Tiger Woods has won eight times. That course made me realize how good you have to play. \nQ: There is a lot of travel during the summer, right? \nA: I was away from home the entire month of July. I was in Florida for two weeks and San Diego for a week. I played in the Optimists tournament for the third straight year. I won that tournament last year. This year, I stayed with a host family in Orlando. One golfer was from Switzerland and another from Colombia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:08:11.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
