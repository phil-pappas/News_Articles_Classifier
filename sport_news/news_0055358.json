I didn’t ask any more questions ... As soon as I heard it was about business, I wasn’t interested any more.”\nChris Cairns arrives at Southwark Crown Court to stand trial for perjury.

The pair were staying in the same hotel on the eve of the inaugural Indian Premier League event.\nMcCullum gave evidence last week claiming Cairns had told him he was the perfect player to engage in spot-fixing whereas some of his countrymen “wouldn’t have the balls” to do it.\nMcCullum said Cairns approached him twice about spot-fixing but acknowledged he made a mistake by failing to report the approaches to the ICC’s anti-corruption unit.\nPonting was cross-examined by defence lawyer Orlando Pownall QC on Tuesday and asked whether he considered McCullum knew about match-fixing or needed it explained to him.\n“Right now, I would; in 2008, not so much,” Ponting replied, later agreeing to a question that a phone call about a business proposition would’ve been “wholly unremarkable”.\nBrendon McCullum says Chris Cairns approached him to engage in spot-fixing. Source: Getty Images\nPonting said he had never talked about the call with McCullum again.\n“For a start I wasn’t aware Brendon had gone and spoken to Chris Cairns,” Ponting said. “It was none of my business. Brendon’s private life and business life was none of my business, I wasn’t going to ask him.”\nOther former cricketers have given evidence at the trial, including Black Caps Kyle Mills, Shane Bond and Shane Bond.\nCairns was accused of match-fixing in 2010 by then IPL chairman Lalit Modi when he was playing for the Chandigarh Lions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) two years earlier.\nCairns sued and won damages but is now accused of lying under oath in the libel case when he said he’d “never” cheated at cricket.\nThe maximum sentence for perjury is seven years in prison.\n Ponting’s explosive evidence at Cairns trial", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/126769b1955d3f6ea8e47865b32790e9", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/784755452ef42f9b0ad6ce666607540e", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F14%2FDVU_141015_CRI_CAIRNS_AT_HIS_BEST_V_AUSTRALIA_PKG.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3dbeba039cdd9d110bb27a1e46587012", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/chris-cairns-trial-ricky-ponting-says-he-was-with-brendon-mccullum-when-proposition-was-made/story-e6frf3g3-1227576274632", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:46:22.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
