(AP Photo) Comments \nThe Buffalo Bills are in London preparing for their NFL game against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium on Monday. Off the practice field, Buffalo All-Pro defensive tackle Marcell Dareus has been the center of attention. \nThe former Alabama standout has taken part in a variety of activities, including tackling Shakespeare with a public reading of selections from \"Romeo and Juliet.\" \nThe former Huffman High School standout also took part in an NFL Play 60 event at the training ground of the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club of the English Premier League, where the British youngsters got a taste of American football and Dareus tried his hand (or feet, in this case) at the game the rest of the world calls football. OK, Pele he ain't, but @buffalobills ' Marcell Dareus shows the kids some skills at @SpursOfficial 's training ground! pic.twitter.com/bbHa08LZJj â€” NFLUK (@NFLUK) October 20, 2015 \nDareus and teammate Jerry Hughes participated in a taste test of British cuisine. Perhaps not surprisingly, the 331-pound Dareus liked the menu, finding the breakfast's blood sausage \"a little bit different from a Jimmy Dean\" and being surprised by how much he liked toad in the hole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:39:27.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
