Arizona's oath once barred membership in the Communist Party and has been successfully challenged in court. It was rewritten in 2003.\n\"Amazingly enough, yes, they can make him sign that oath,\" Barr said.\nBut, he said, it doesn't make much sense when everyone employed by the state, including janitors, takes the oath.\nAbout 800 adjunct faculty members were asked to sign the pledge ahead of the school's accreditation renewal next year, the school said. If students don't agree with the requirement, they can contact state legislators or Secretary of State Michele Reagan, said the school's interim president, Chris Haines.\n\"We must abide by the law,\" Haines said.\nStudent Patricia Rudnyk signed up for Sallis' class several times and said she doesn't believe he can be replaced.\n\"We fought for these rights,\" she said. \"Don't just sign them away.\"\n___\nInformation from: KPNX-TV, http://www.12news.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1QJFxrN"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:49:01.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
