He is going to play for us for the next few years. He loves rugby union, he is settled in Bath and he knows he is a six [blindside flanker]. \n\"He said to me 'I know I am a six'. He enjoys being a six, he enjoys the game better because he is more involved. Proving he is an international back-rower is the big challenge now for Sam.\" \nEngland coach Stuart Lancaster did not consider Burgess as an option in the back row because he was not a viable line-out jumper. \nBut Ford said: \"We've said 'Come back to Bath, carry on playing well'. We have an unbelievable run of fixtures coming up. We have Toulon, Leinster, Leicester, Northampton and Wasps twice. \n\"If he can play six in those games against the best in Europe, I am sure England will have a look at him in that role. I am sure he'll break into the international squad as a six. I am hoping that he excels with us over the next few months and then if England consider him again, it'll only be in the back row. \n\"We will no doubt show everyone he is a back row, not a centre.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:48:54.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
