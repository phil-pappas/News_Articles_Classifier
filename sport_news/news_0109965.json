I looked at him and said 'I'm taking you to the hospital.' He looked pretty bad. I asked God 'Let him live, let him live,'\" Parr recalled . \"I got right over his face and said that. I don't think he heard me.\"\nParr reportedly died of congestive heart failure. Born in Montgomery, AL, Parr died at a hospice facility in Washington.\n\"Without Jerry looking out for Ronnie on March 30, 1981, I would have certainly lost my best friend and roommate to an assassin's bullet,\" former first lady Nancy Reagan said in a statement obtained by CNN . \"Jerry was not only one of the finest Secret Service agents to ever serve this country, but one of the most decent human beings I've ever known. He was humble but strong, reserved but confident, and blessed with a great sense of humor. It is no wonder that he and my husband got along so well.\"\nHinckley Jr. was found not guilty by reason of insanity and is confined to a mental facility.\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
