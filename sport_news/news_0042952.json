This excellence is now something that is expected of them, according to Ozark coach Yancey Little.“We’ve had some of those close games, but as long as you win and move on that’s all that matters,” said Little. Branson (12-14) put up a fight in the district semifinal round on Thursday night at Kickapoo, as Ozark (22-4) escaped them 5-3, after being tied at three midway through the fourth inning.“We kept battling. Branson played very well. I thought they pitched very well and very smart and kept us off balance. We put pressure on them just about every inning, but we just didn’t come up with that big hit,” said Little. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE GAME The Pirates scored a run early in the first inning, but Ozark answered back with three of its own before the inning was over. But Branson’s designated hitter Gracie Jeager ripped a double up the right field line to bring in two runs to tie the game up at 3 in the third inning. Ozark quickly took back the lead via a run brought in by catcher Lauren Chambers in the bottom of the fourth, and solidified their lead in the sixth with a double from Eva Rasey that brought in a run.“We had that one with Eva. She had that nice hit there in the sixth inning that gave us a two-run cushion which is important,” said Little. Ozark pitcher Brooke Pridgen threw two strikeouts and gave up only six hits through seven innings pitched.“I was relying a lot on my change-up and curve ball. If they were in front of the box I sent my change-up to keep them off balance and if they were in the back I sent them my curveball to keep them off balance.” Despite the season-ending loss, Branson coach Mary Arnold said she’s proud of how hard her team played against Ozark, a team that nearly run-ruled the Pirates earlier in the season.“Good teams make good plays and that’s what they did. But I don’t think it’s anything you can take away from our performance either,” said Branson coach Mary Arnold. “We almost got run-ruled earlier in the year from them and gave up four homeruns. Today we battled. Take away the first inning of the game and things are a whole lot different.” Ozark will play host Kickapoo at 5 p.m. on Friday evening for the district championship.
