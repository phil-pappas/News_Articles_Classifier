I said to the lads that someone else has to have the horrible feeling of losing as we'd not won for a while. \n\"Now it's about trying to build on this result. We need to get some consistency. \n\"So the message will be to use this result to push on and not be up and down in terms of performances and results.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:18:41.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
