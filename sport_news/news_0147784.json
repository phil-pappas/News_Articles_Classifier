They are scheduled to play a split doubleheader today. \nThe New York Yankees’ game in Baltimore and the Marlins-Phillies game in Philadelphia also were rained out and rescheduled as part of doubleheaders today. \nHowever, that schedule may be in jeopardy as rain and wind are forecast throughout the weekend. The weather had already postponed racing on tracks and grass Friday. \nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Joaquin’s threat to the East Coast was fading as new forecasts showed it likely to curve out into the Atlantic while moving north and weakening in coming days. \nSo the NFL said it expected the Washington Redskins’ home game against the Philadelphia Eagles to be played as scheduled Sunday at 1 p.m.. \nThe nearby University of Maryland did adjust, moving up the start time of its football game against No. 22 Michigan today from 8 p.m. to noon. \nIn Dover, Delaware, rain wiped out qualifying for the NASCAR playoff race Sunday at Dover International Speedway. Rain also washed out qualifying for the NHRA event in Mohnton, Pennsylvania. \nStaff/wire report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:00:49.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
