Newark’s Thompson (17-1, 6 KOs) has traveled to Manchester, England, where he’ll box Liverpool’s Smith (20-0-1, 10 KOs) on Saturday night for the vacant WBO junior middleweight title. If Thompson wins, he’ll become the first fighter from New Jersey to own a recognized world title since Paterson native Kendall Holt held the WBO junior welterweight championship from July 2008-April 2009. Thompson, 26, knocked out Los Angeles’ Brandon Adams (17-2, 12 KOs) in the second round May 22 in Corona, Calif., to move into position for a title shot. The former New Jersey Golden Gloves champion and Smith will fight for the 154-pound championship the WBO stripped from Demetrius Andrade (21-0, 14 KOs) on July 31 because he didn’t make a title defense for more than a year.\nLOCAL LOOK: Paterson natives and Eastside alums Curtis Harris and Omar Sheika will be part of the inaugural class of the New Jersey Amateur Boxing Hall of Fame on Oct. 25 at Amici Ristorante in Linden. Harris won a 132-pound national Golden Gloves title in 1974, when he beat eventual International Boxing Hall of Famer Aaron Pryor on his way to the championship. Sheika was an alternate on the 1996 U.S. Olympic Team and fought for super middleweight world titles four times during a 15-year pro career that ended in 2012. Call 973-471-2458 for tickets ($65) to the 4 p.m. dinner and induction ceremonies.\nTHE FINAL BELL: HBO’s Jim Lampley moved Andre Ward into the top spot on his pound-for-pound list during an episode of \"The Fight Game\" that debuted Wednesday night. Ward (28-0, 15 KOs) obviously has the résumé to warrant consideration, but a shoulder injury and promotional problems have limited him to two fights in the past three years. That’s not nearly enough activity to be called the best boxer in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:04.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
