On that cold Wisconsin afternoon, it was Minnesota Vikings safety Harrison Smith who out-jumped Greg Jennings to come down with a Rodgers bomb.\nThis time it was a little bit of bad luck at the line of scrimmage that resulted in the turnover:\nIn between, Rodgers went 19 full games without an interception in Green Bay, going 317-of-456 for 4,299 yards and 43 touchdowns. The Green Bay Packers went 14-1 during the streak (Rodgers missed seven games with a collarbone injury in 2013).\nThe total streak, including the end of the Minnesota game and the start of Monday night's contest, covered 587 attempts, including 48 touchdowns -- all of which are NFL records.\nOf course, Rodgers' ridiculous stats at Lambeau aren't limited to those 19 games. Coming into Monday night, his career passer rating at home is a league-record 113.4, almost 13 full points ahead of Peyton Manning's 100.6, and his touchdown-to-interception ratio of 5.9 is a long way ahead of second-place Tom Brady's 3.7.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:40:34.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
