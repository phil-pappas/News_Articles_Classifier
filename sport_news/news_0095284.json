Photo by Matt Kincaid/Getty Images The Dallas Stars completed a four-game road trip last night with a 4-1 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins . It was the fifth win in a row for the red hot Stars and completed a two-game season sweep against the Pens. Pittsburgh lost to the Stars on Opening Night 0-3. After last night’s game Dallas is now 6-1-0 on the young season.\nThe Penguins were hoping for redemption after being shutout against the Stars in the first meeting, and in the first ten minutes of the game they looked like the Penguins of the old. A beautiful blueline bomb from Johnny Oduya completely stunned Marc-Andre Fleury to give Oduya his first goal as a Star and opened up a night of scoring for Dallas. The Stars added another goal in the first period off a John Klingberg power play goal with help from Patrick Sharp. A costly turnover in the second led to an unassisted goal from Jason Spezza, and Mattias Janmark earned his third goal of the season to round out the Stars scoring. An unassisted goal from Nick Bonino accounted for the lone Penguins goal.\nOnce again, goaltending and special teams were the difference maker in the game. “Nemo made some great saves,” said Oduya in postgame commentary . “Otherwise we could have been down two, three goals.”\nThe Stars also successfully killed off five penalty kills including a dangerous 5-on-3 situation near the end of the game. Vern Fiddler was sent to the box for tripping at 16:27 in the third. Less than thirty seconds later Jason Demers was given a major penalty and a game misconduct for an elbow to Bonino. The Penguins pulled Fleury to give them a 6-on-3 advantage for nearly a minute and half but failed to produce a goal thanks to stellar goaltending from Antti Niemi .\nThe NHL Department of Player Safety announced today that Oduya would receive a hearing on Friday for the hit on Bonino.\nThe Stars return home to the American Airlines Center for a four-game homestand where they will seem the Panthers, Ducks, Canucks and Sharks. The first game is on Saturday, Oct. 24 at 7 p.m. against the Panthers.", "external_links": ["http://stars.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/boxscore?id=2015020093", "http://video.stars.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=853822&catid=1229"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:59:15.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
