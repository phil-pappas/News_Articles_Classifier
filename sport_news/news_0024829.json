Both ended up getting off to unbeaten starts as they look to head into the playoffs with momentum as we recap the day. D1 Bound Edges NJ Demons 36-34 This game saw the stars out in full force with head coach Mike Toro highlighting his D1 Bound team with Dominique Toussaint (Christ the King '16) and Jordan Wilmoth (Immaculate Heart, NJ '16) , heading to Virginia and Dayton respectively.The Demons though countered with UConn commit Andra Espinoza-Hunter (Blair Academy, NJ '17) , and 6'9\" high major recruit Felicia Aiyeotan (Blair Academy, NJ '16) , and from the start you knew this one was going to be a barnburner.It was a back and forth start with Toussaint and Espinoza-Hunter trading threes, and while both teams didn't struggle to finish around the rim, Toussaint had 9 in the opening half, while Espinoza-Hunter had 8 so it was no shock that the teams were tied at 13 heading into the half.A large chunk of the second half belonged to the Demons as they controlled the pace of play, and were able to start getting Aiyeotan in position to score inside, while the backcourt duo of Keer Sun (Blair Academy, NJ '16) and Julia Cunningham (Watchung Hills, NJ '18) helped propel them to a 32-23 lead with 4:04 to play in the game.Normally that would be a deficit just too big to overcome, but when you have the talent that D1 Bound has, you absolutely couldn't rule them out, and they proved to have the fortitude to fight through and make the big run that near everyone in the building expected.Toussaint made clutch FT's off a missed three, and Jada Lucas (New London, CT '17) was able to pressure the ball in the backcourt on defense and create back to back turnovers which led to easy D1 Bound points on the other end.Espinoza-Hunter fouled out with just over a minute to go and that seemed to be the final straw for the Demons as Wilmoth punctuated a 12-0 to see D1 go up 35-32 with 37.8 seconds to go in the game.Aiyeotan was able to finish on a second chance inside with 14.2 seconds to play to cut the D1 lead to 35-34, and while Toussaint went just 1 of 2 from the FT line in the closing seconds, the Demons couldn't get off a good look for the win as Katie Kinum (New Providence, NJ '17) had the ball stolen near midcourt as time ran out, giving D1 Bound a hard fought, come from behind victory over a talented NJ Demons squad, 36-34.While Toussaint led D1 with 13 points in the winning cause, there were a lot of others that contributed including Wilmoth and Lucas who each had 6 points a piece in the victory.In the defeat it was Espinoza-Hunter who paced the Demons with 13 points of her own, with Sun and Aiyeotan each chipping in with 7 points in the loss. D1 Bound Tops Scarborough Blues, 45-38 This was another tough and hard fought game that D1 Bound found a way to pull out. They were up by just 4 at the half as the Canadian squad came to play early in the morning, but down the stretch it was once again too much Toussaint as she raised her game when her team needed her most to snag the 7 point win.Even though D1 didn't shoot the ball all that well in this one, they got there was to the basket and were able to beat the Blues defenders to the basket, with Toussaint scoring 11 of her 16 points in the second half to push D1 Bound over the top late.Lucas was excellent at the lead guard spot once again, and Alisia Machado (Medgar Evers '16) provided a valuable weapon on the perimeter knocked down a pair of second half threes in a solid offensive effort. Jaclyn Ronson (JC Richardson, ON '16) led Scarborough with 10 points in the loss though the Blues played a strong game from start to finish in hanging with one of the Rose Classic's elite teams. New Heights Over Westchester Hoopers (Reynolds), 39-24 This wasn't what one would call a great effort by New Heights in the teams first of three games on the day, but head coach Chez Williams had his team pressure the ball for much of the second half against a shorthanded Hoopers squad as they pulled away late for the convincing win.Early on it looked like no one wanted to win the game as both teams combined to shoot rather poorly from the outside. It wasn't until nearly 12 minutes into the game that a three ball was hit when Sydney Zambrotta (Christ the King '16) broke the ice with a long three from the left side. Kaelynn Satterfield (Christ the King '19) , one of the top freshmen in New York, putting on a passing display as she was able to step out and find cutting guards going to the basket for New Heights as they finished the first half strong going on a 16-3 run to take a 25-14 lead into the break.Playing with just 5 players, the Hoopers were going to be in for a struggle against a talented New Heights team, and it put even more pressure on the shoulders of star guard Teisha Hyman (Woodlands '19) to perform, but constantly being double and even triple teamed, never allowed her to get in a flow or rhythm to get good looks at the rim.Zambrotta hit a pair of long jumpers to get her shot going for the rest of the day, while Lynette Taitt (Bishop Loughlin '16) was a defensive maven creating havoc in the backcourt all game long, allowing New Heights to get the day started off on a positive note by taking the 15 point win.It wasn't the performance that Williams would've liked, but they got the job done with Zambrotta scoring 16 points to lead New Heights in the win. Satterfield and Skydajah Patterson (Bishop Loughlin '16) each had 6 points as well in the win.Hyman was limited to just 12 in the loss for the Westchester Hoopers, but considering the defenses thrown at her all game long, it's a credit to her abilities that she was able to do as much as she did. New Heights white-out Scarborough Blues, 68-47 Give New Heights a lot of credit in their second game of the day as against a team that gave D1 Bound all sorts of trouble they thrived, controlling the game from the start, with Milicia Reid (Bishop Loughlin '17) putting together a first half to remember, helping them blow past their Canadian counterparts with ease.Reid didn't have the best of first games as she only had 2 points against the Hoopers, but she clearly came out with a purpose in this one as she was able to get out in transition and do a great job finishing driving to the basket, or pulling up for solid midrange looks.She had 14 points in the first half as New Heights grabbed a 13 point lead at the half, and they never looked back from there.It was a game high 21 points for Reid, while her Loughlin teammates Patterson and Toucan Billings (Bishop Loughlin '16) each had 12 points to easily roll past Scarborough for the 68-47 win. Rachel Woodburn (Pickering, ON '16) was a star though for the Blues as she had 17 of the 47 Scarborough points, and looked the part of a D1 prospect from up north. New Heights Bully Cape Cod Bulls, 49-24 It was another nice and easy victory for New Heights to close out their 3 games on Saturday as after a slow first 4 minutes, they ran out and took a dominating 15 point halftime lead en route to a 25 point win.With the route on early it was a balanced team effort for New Heights as Taitt led the way with 12 points, but Brie Pergola (Torrington, CT '17) was a fantastic outside shooting threat as she connected on 3 threes in the second half to finish with 9 points. Zambrotta also had 9, with Reid adding 7 in the victory. Joie Grassi (Plymouth North, MA '17) led the Bulls with 9 in the loss, with Erin Hill (Martha's Vineyard, MA '17) scoring all 7 of her points in the first half for Cape Cod in the defeat. Castle Athletics best Canarsie Nation 36-33 It was the Infinity Hammonds (Murry Bergtraum '17) show as the transfer from down in Virginia proved she is going to be a difference maker in the PSAL this season. She is small at just 5'4\", but she is a dangerous shooter and great playmaker as she showed on Saturday, helping lead Castle back from a 7 point deficit in the second half, to grab the 3 point win over a tough Canarsie squad.It was Hammonds and Cinnamon Dockery (Murry Bergtraum '18) that really did most of the damage late in the game as the duo was able to score driving inside, while Hammonds was also finding Dockery, and other Castle teammates in great spots to score as the Canarsie defense began collapsing on the diminutive guard. Brianna Jones (Canarsie '18) knocked down 3 of her 4 three point attempts, and Kania Pollack (Boys and Girls '18) did an excellent job at running the offense and being a facilitator, but there was too many 2nd chance points late, and a couple clutch Hammonds buckets sealed it as Castle fought back and took the impressive win, 36-33.Hammonds had 15 points and number of highlight reel assists to lead the way in the win for Castle, while Dockery and Daiyanni Davis (Murry Bergtraum '17) each had 8 points to help push them to the win.Jones and her 9 points led Canarsie Nation in the very tough defeat, with Tamia Tart (Boys and Girls '18) chipping in with 8 as well in the loss. Castle (Luck) stops United NJ (Navy), 25-22 The second Castle Athletics entry in the Rose Classic may not have the standout stars, but they got a great second half from Cristina Camerlengo (Susan Wagner '17) as they came all the way back from a 13-5 halftime deficit to score 20 second half points and rally late for the 3 point win.Camerlengo had 8 points, but she had 6 of those in the closing 5 minutes of the game when Castle made their big run, and helping her was Meaurie Pickett (Trenton Catholic, NJ '16) who had some clutch rebounds on both ends of the floor late to help seal the victory. Keiko Fox (Bridgewater-Raritan, NJ '18) had her 8 points all in the opening half, as the United NJ guards seemed sluggish and nervous with the ball in their hands late, which opened the door for big defensive opportunities that Castle took advantage of to bring home the come from behind win.
