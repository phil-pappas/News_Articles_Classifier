Incumbents and newcomers are calling for district-wide change during their campaigns this fall, but their plans differ depending on what they perceive to be the district's greatest weakness.\nThere are seven candidates running for three open seats; two of those, Dan Jorgensen and Cathy Wildman, are current members. Mary Lewis, the internally selected secretary for the board, is term-limited.\nThe five new faces are Linda Cerva, Grant Barrett, Billie Ann Day, Monica Colbert and Mike Donald.\nThe top three candidates will get seats on the at-large, seven-member board and serve for four years. The election is nonpartisan.\nA recent study completed by a group of 17 community and education groups found that only about 50 percent of students in the Aurora Public Schools District graduate high school. There are more than 41,000 students in the district who come from 130 different countries, and nearly 30,000 of them qualify for free and reduced lunch.\nAdvertisement For the candidates, the report's findings were staggering and disheartening, but each of them pinpointed an area for improvement that they found most pressing.\nFor Cerva, a tax advisor and former paralegal, the language barriers and lack of at-home support that many students face in APS is a dire challenge.\n\"We should bring in teachers who speak different languages that are adaptable to the students and their needs,\" Cerva said. \"There could also be something like a parents night where parents come in and learn the math and literature that their children are studying so that they can help their children with their homework.\"\nBarrett, the owner of Abilene Awards and Logos at 13900 E. Florida Ave., said the district needs a greater diversity in institutional options, including more magnet and charter schools. Barrett has six children in APS, and he and his wife attended district schools themselves.\n\"Any decisions that I make would be focused around student achievement,\" he said. \" There's going to be competing ideas for how to make that happen, but my decisions will lean toward what's best for students.\"\nDay is a former high school teacher for inner-city and college preparatory public schools in Washington, D.C. She has a doctorate in education and a master's degree in African history. She moved to Aurora in 2006 after her retirement and said that after years of observing the district, she believes she can affect the type of change needed by answering crucial questions.\n\"Who are the individual students behind the statistics in that report? Why are they what they are, and what is the difference between the other areas of the state with which they are compared?\" Day said. \"I support early childhood education, increased funding and would seek to engage the community to understand the need for that.\"\nColbert is a nonprofit worker who has spent much of her career in the mental health field all over the state. She said that mental health resources for students are integral to their success and development. She has two daughters in the district.\n\"I think it's obvious that graduation rates are not where they should be. It's not how we want to be represented as a community, and it's not what we want Aurora to be known for,\" she said. \"But you can't address the overall academic achievement of children if other basic human needs aren't being met.\"\nDonald did not return calls for an interview, but a post on his Facebook page from Sept. 3 offers a position statement for his candidacy that includes an opposition to Common Core standards and support of merit-based programs for teachers.\nCurrent board treasurer Jorgensen and vice president Wildman are up for reelection. Both have backgrounds in teaching â€” Jorgensen has a doctorate in education, has been a teacher at the college level, worked in educational administration at APS and also worked for the Department of Education. He has three kids who are in or have finished school in the district.\nWildman taught first through fifth grade in APS since 1985 and also served as a teacher mentor.\n\"When Dan and I came on the board, we both had a history at APS,\" Wildman said. \"I was a teacher there for 25 years, and he worked out of the assessment office. I would be concerned about turnover at this point because there is huge learning curve. I just personally think it would be very difficult.\"\nIf Jorgensen and Wildman are unseated, six of seven members would have two years or less experience on the board.\nThe board of education approves curricula and instructional materials, evaluates the superintendent and adopts the annual budget. In APS, current board has devised a strategic plan, APS2020: Shaping the Future , that delineates their goals for student success, which they have devised over more than a year of work.\n\"I moved to Aurora two years ago and constantly heard conversations in the community with disgruntled district parents,\" Cerva said. \"This happened on the watch of the current board. The incumbents who are up for reelection, and I hate to say that ... but those (graduation rate) statistics tore my heart to pieces, and I believe that I can do something to create change.\"\nJorgensen and Wildman said too much change on the board could rupture the work that the existing board has done to create its strategic plan. They say this is not the time for change in leadership.\n\"I have great appreciation for anyone who steps up to run for the board ... but my concern is that I don't believe the district can go through another leadership cycle and turnover of current board members,\" Jorgensen said. \"Quite honestly, it takes two years to get enough experience to be effective. And right now it's too critical with where the accountability clock is. We can't step back. We have to have people who already know how to hold ourselves and the administration accountable.\"\nMegan Mitchell: 303-954-2650, mmitchell@denverpost.com or @Mmitchelldp\nElection information\nAdams County: co-adamscounty.civicplus.com or 720-523-6500\nArapahoe County: www.arapahoevotes.com or call 303-795-4511", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/The.Donald.For.School.Board", "http://aps2020.aurorak12.org/reform/"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:14:12.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
