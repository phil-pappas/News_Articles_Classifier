Mariners 2B Robinson Cano undergoes surgery for sports hernia 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nMariners second baseman Robinson Cano will be out an estimated six weeks after he underwent surgery Tuesday in Philadelphia to repair a right side and left side core muscle injury, per a statement from GM Jerry Dipoto. \nCano is expected to recover from what's typically referred to as a sports hernia well before spring training starts in February. \nThe surgery was performed by Dr. William Meyers of the Vincera Institute. According to Tuesday's release, Cano was first diagnosed with a core injury to his right side in late September, but a pre-surgery MRI by Dr. Meyers revealed that his left side was also injured. \nCano, 32, played through the injury and finished the regular season on a 16-game hitting streak, capping a huge second half of 2015. Over his final 82 games, he batted .330 with 17 home runs, 55 RBIs and 15 doubles to go along with 52 runs. \nIt marked a 180-degree turnaround after Cano got off to a mediocre start to his second season in Seattle before hitting .212 during June as the Mariners fell out of the playoff race. The prolonged slump caused Cano to miss an American League All-Star selection for the first time in five seasons. On July 28, he sustained what was announced as an abdominal strain, but only missed three games. \nIn an interview with USA Today in July , Cano shouldered the blame for his bad first half but also said he was dealing with acid reflux disease and the death of his grandfather, Ovidio, in March. \nThe veteran's strong second half helped him approach his career averages, but much of it came after Mariners management had given up chasing the second AL Wild Card. In 156 games, Cano batted .287 with 21 homers and 79 RBIs. \nThis is the second straight year Cano misses some of his offseason. Last November, he suffered a non-displaced fracture of his right small toe when he was hit by a pitch in an All-Star game in Japan. \nCano still has seven seasons remaining on the 10-year, $240-million contract he signed in December of 2013. He turns 33 on October 22. \nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Mariners news . Contact sports reporter Adam Lewis at adam lewis@seattlepi.com or @AdamLewisPI .
