Music pounded. Quarterback Johnny Manziel threw go-routes to starting tackle Jake Matthews, just because. The looseness of it all initially chafed Polian, who Saturday brings the Wolf Pack into Kyle Field.\nBut Polian said the atmosphere fostered by coach Kevin Sumlin made an impression on him.\n\"The single biggest lesson that he taught me is that football should be fun,\" Polian told reporters this week. \"He didn't mind playing music, he liked them bouncing around, he liked when they had smiles on their faces. ... I saw how effective it was. When we went into big games, they were loose.\"\nThe No. 17 Aggies are heavily favored to get the most enjoyment out of Saturday's meeting. It's A&M's final nonconference game before SEC play starts next week against Arkansas in Arlington's AT&T Stadium.\nPolishing for conference competition and staying healthy while getting to 3-0 would be the Aggies' ideal outcome against the Mountain West Conference opponent. A&M cruised over overmatched Ball State 56-23 a week ago, and Nevada (1-1) fell to then then-No. 22 Arizona, 44-20.\nA&M will attempt to continue last week's offensive flow, when the Aggies scored touchdowns on six of their seven first-half drives.\nStarting sophomore quarterback Kyle Allen impressed offensive coordinator Jake Spavital.\n\"He played great,\" Spavital said. \"He looks very comfortable back in the pocket. He's composed. I think he's playing at a very high level. He's making mature checks. ... The kid's playing very smart right now.\"\nA&M will continue to try to get sophomore receiver Speedy Noil, also a return threat, more involved. He's been slowed to this point by a non-specified soft tissue injury, but coaches said that he's looking more like the player who occasionally made jaw-dropping plays as a freshman.\n\"I think you saw a better version of him last week. He's starting to get healthier,\" Sumlin said.\nThe Aggies also expect to work several defensive players back into the mix. Linebacker A.J. Hilliard returns from suspension, and linebacker Josh Walker is expected to return from an unspecified injury. Defensive tackle Julien Obioha may make his season debut after undergoing an appendectomy shortly before the start of the season, Sumlin said.\nThe depth will be vital as A&M heads into league competition.\nA&M's defense gave up 74 yards on Ball State's first two plays last week but tightened to allow just 102 total yards in the half. The Aggies also didn't allow the Cardinals to convert a third down in eight first-half attempts.\nA&M will host its second game in the new Kyle Field since its $485 million makeover, after drawing 104,000 against Ball State. School officials this week said they are addressing fans' concerns over opening issues that included long concession lines, audio failures and problems navigating the new stadium.\nPolian had his own issues a week ago, receiving two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties during the loss to Arizona. Nevada fined the coach $10,000 for what athletic director Doug Knuth called sideline behavior that didn't align with the values of the university.\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-19T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:51:04.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
