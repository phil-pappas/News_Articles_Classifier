(AP) - A new proposal seeks a statewide election on removing the Confederate battle emblem from Mississippi's flag. But it could be years before the issue reaches a ballot, and there's no guarantee voters would accept it.\nMississippi officials said Friday that a Jackson resident filed paperwork for a ballot initiative that would erase all references to the Confederacy from the flag, where the emblem has been since 1894. Voters chose to keep it in 2001, but the shooting of nine black worshippers at a South Carolina church in June has renewed debate about publicly displaying Confederate symbols.\nCritics say the emblem is a divisive reminder of slavery and segregation. Supporters call it a symbol of Southern heritage.\nThe earliest the proposal could be on the ballot is 2018.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
