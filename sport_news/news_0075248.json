He was a limited participant in practice on Friday after also being limited on Wednesday and Thursday. Iloka said on Wednesday he expects to play against Seattle, \"barring a setback,\" and the fact that he was at least a limited participant in practice all three days is a sign he will probably play against the Seahawks. \nShawn Williams played 63 of 75 defensive snaps in place of Iloka against Kansas City. \nGilberry is battling a calf injury and was a limited participant in Friday's practice after not practicing on Wednesday or Thursday. That's probably a good sign that he will be able to play against Seattle. \nThree other players are listed as probable: running back Jeremy Hill, cornerback Adam Jones and safety Reggie Nelson. All three were full participants in Friday's practice. \nJones is dealing with a groin injury and didn't practice on Wednesday and was limited on Thursday. \nHill has a knee injury that led to him being a limited participant on Wednesday and Thursday. \nNelson has a hamstring injury that had him as a limited participant on Wednesday, but he was back to being a full participant on Thursday. \nThe Seahawks injury report will be announced later this afternoon. \nJeremy Hill photo: Tony Tribble for Local 12 \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
