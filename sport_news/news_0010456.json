Comment Staff Writer Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 1:19 pm Updated at 6:36 PM PETERSBURG — The Richard Bland College men’s soccer team can best be described as a melting pot. Robin Jonathan Deutsch, RBC director of athletics communications and marketing, said that, of the 22 players on the roster, 12 of them are not originally from the United States. “If you were to look at Division I, they might have a spattering of international players,\" Deutsch said. \"This is really very rare to have this many international players.\" The team’s head coach Eduardo de Souza, who came to RBC in June 2014, is also not from the U.S. originally. He hails from Brazil and has been coaching for 14 years. When he arrived, there was only one player left from the year before. “I recruited the rest within two months to start the season in August,” de Souza said. “I basically had to start from scratch.” He recruited his players by contacting his personal and international connections. His efforts resulted in what the team is today: a diverse mix of cultures and backgrounds. Players have come from all over the world - from Portugal in Europe to Bosnia-Herzegovina to Kenya in Africa. “I think it’s very good because it brings diversity to the school, the soccer team and athletic department. Soccer is an international game, called football outside of the United States, so in a lot of countries around the world, it’s the number-one sport,” de Souza said. “It’s important to have this diversity on the team because they’re going to bring their background on the game and their knowledge on the game from their own countries. \"They watch live games over there, play everyday in school and club,\" the head coach added. \"It’s really 24 hours of soccer, so it’s helped them to understand the game better and to love the culture of soccer.” The players also agree and enjoy learning about each other’s cultures. Sukrija Dudic, freshman forward from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and sophomore forward Godfred Obed Baisel both said they spend a lot of time with their teammates playing the video game FIFA, debating about soccer and studying. “I think we get along really well because everyone has different views and opinions from their country,\" Dudic said. \"Everyone incorporates their opinions from their country. And since we’re all international, everyone is more accepting.\" Dudic said the best part about having such a diverse team is the food. “In my room, one of my roommates is from France. We have someone from Argentina, Sierra Leone, El Salvador and Ethiopia. We all just share - we’re like a family so everyone’s curious as to what other dishes taste like. I think the best is when our families come to visit for home games, so they all bring dishes and all of us eat each other’s food,” Dudic said. As far as speaking to those teammates who aren’t as advanced in speaking English, de Souza said he often tries to speak to players in their native language because he speaks Spanish and Portuguese. Baisel said players help one another if they are not confident in their English. “We try to reach out, listen to them carefully and just put in our mind that they’re not good with English so we have to be more patient. It’s been going pretty well,” Baisel said. With the season coming to a close, de Souza said he wants to continue recruiting players at home and abroad to bring more diversity and international students to the school. “It’s going to be good for the school, for the regular students here to interact with such a diverse environment and for my team of course,\" de Souza said, \"because we’re not just going to grow on the field, but off the field too because it’s a good learning curve for everybody.” • Amir Vera may be reached at avera@progress-index.com or (804) 722-5155.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:06:10.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
