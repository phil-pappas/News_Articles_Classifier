The Aggies have gone from being labeled as one of the worst football programs in the nation to a consistent winner over the course of just six seasons. \nOne of the most recognizable signs of this is this oft used stat: Utah State is one of just four FBS programs to win at least 30 games and record three bowl victories in the past three years joining Clemson, Michigan State and Oregon. Those are big name programs to be mentioned with, but there is just one problem: It is not enough. \nThe Aggies still find themselves on the outside the top Group of Five programs. They are not Boise State. They have not won the big games schools like Utah and TCU did before they joined the higher ranks when the conference realignment craze happened. \nThey are not at the level of Northern Illinois. Yes, I know the Aggies beat NIU in the 2013 Poinsettia Bowl. NIU won at least a share of its conference championship for the last five seasons. Utah State does not have the name recognition or history of programs like Cincinnati or Memphis. \nGiven the opportunity, the Aggies have usually performed great against big-name opponents on the national stage but ultimately find a way to lose. It all started in 2011 when Chuckie Keeton led the Aggies to a near upset of the defending national champion Auburn Tigers. Auburn needed two touchdowns in the last two minutes to pull out the victory. \nIn 2012, a missed chip-shot field goal against Wisconsin with just six seconds left kept the Aggies from walking out of Camp Randell as world-beaters. The Aggies gave USC all it could handle in 2013, ultimately falling short by three points. \nIt is a disheartening cycle. The Aggies have come so close to joining the select group of Group of Five teams. There is only one way to truly become an elite Group of Five team. \nTo be the best you have to beat the best, and for a long time Boise State has been the best. Make no mistake about it this game is a big deal. Utah State head coach Matt Wells touched on it briefly in Monday's press conference. \n\"I have a lot of respect for this program. It's going to be a major challenge for us, but one that I know we're up for and one we're excited about,\" he said. \"We haven't beaten them yet since we have been in this league, but the fact that the winner is in the driver's seat for the Mountain Division, makes it a big game. We're excited for the challenge. We have a lot of respect for that program and staff.\" \nA loss at home to Boise State sentences the Aggies to another year of being, at best, second-best. Another year of waiting to prove they truly belong at the top of the Group of Five teams. Another year of a program waiting to take that step forward. \nSo the Aggies need to, in the immortal words of former Raiders owner Al Davis, \"Just win, baby!\" Parker Robertson is a graduate of Utah State University, a freelance contributor and an avid fan of sports.
