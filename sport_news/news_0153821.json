The college, which is closed, hopes to open early next week.\nThe gunman, 26-year-old Christopher Harper Mercer, opened fire inside a classroom, killing nine people before dying in a shootout with police, authorities said. Read more about Mercer here.\nIt’s not clear if Mercer killed himself or died from officers’ gunfire.\nAt least seven other people were hurt during the rampage.\nGunman had multiple weapons\nAt a news conference Friday morning, Douglas County, Ore. Sheriff Jon Hanlin said teams of investigators and victim specialists were working with families, helping facilitate next-of-kin notifications and providing counseling resources.\n“The families are currently living through the nightmare in the most personal way possible,” said Hanlin said, asking for the media to respect their privacy.\nHe then introduced FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Celinez Nunez.\n\"We have recovered a total of 13 weapons that are connected to the shooter and/or the shooter’s residence,\" said Nunez.\nSix guns -- five pistols and a rifle -- were found at the college. Of the seven that were found at his home, there were two pistols, four rifles and one shotgun. I nvestigators also recovered a significant amount of ammunition there.\nA flak jacket with steel plates inside as well as five magazines of ammunition was recovered lying next to one of the rifles inside the school.\n#UCCShooting press conf. closed w/ reminder of toll-free Tip Line number for relevant incident info/photos: 1-800-CALL-FBI. Choose option 7.\n— Douglas Co Sheriff (@DouglasCoSO) October 2, 2015\nMotive for rampage\nPolice have blocked off Mercer's apartment four miles north of the college in Roseburg. The search may reveal why he went on the rampage.\nThe father of an injured student, who spoke with reporters outside a hospital, said Mercer was targeting students based on their religion.\n“This man had enough time to ask people, one by one, what their religion was – ‘Are you a Christian?’ he would ask them. Then (he said) ‘Stand up’ and they would stand up and he said, ‘Good, because you're a Christian you're going to see God in about one second,’ and then he shot and killed them,” said Stacy Boylan.\nSimilar accounts have been reported, but Boylan’s account has not been corroborated by police.\nHundreds at a candlelight vigil in Roseburg. 10 dead, 7 hurt in shooting at Umpqua Community College #UCCschooting pic.twitter.com/RzqR1Zhz55\n— Kevin McCarty (@KevinKIRO7) October 2, 2015 Gunman’s father reacts\nThe gunman's father said the only word to describe his emotions following the shootings is shock.\n“I am just as shocked as anybody at what happened. Obviously, it’s been a devastating day for me and my family,” Ian Mercer said as he spoke to reporters briefly Thursday night outside of his Los Angeles area home.\nHe said he is speaking to the FBI, but asked for privacy for his family.\nActive shooter tactics\nMeanwhile, officials say the actions of officers likely saved lives.\nPolice employed a tactic to help get paramedics to victims much quicker. They brought rescuers into what they call a \"warm zone\" -- an unsecured area during a shooting.\nThe idea is to first get victims medical treatment and then get them out of the building, as soon as they can.\nOfficials have not said exactly how the shooter interacted with the victims as he fired, but one active shooter expert, Jesus Villahermosa, says the best thing you can do is lock yourself down in a room.\nAgain, we thank hundreds of LE officers, mental-health counselors, victim specialists & others from all over OR who responded. #UCCShooting\n— Douglas Co Sheriff (@DouglasCoSO) October 2, 2015 But Villahermosa says too many students are taught to duck and cover, no matter where they are.\n“Lockdown is the number one tactic that saves the greatest amount of lives. But if you’re near the shooter, the next tactic is run,” said Villahermosa.\nVillahermosa says duck and cover only works if you're in a locked room. If you're in the same room as the shooter, you either need to run or fight, according to Villahermosa.\nVillahermosa recently taught the survivor tactic to 6,000 students in the Olympia School District.\nSeveral local districts, including Issaquah, have adopted the FBI's \"run- hide- fight\" strategy.\nThousands attend vigil\nThursday night, thousands of people packed a Roseburg park for a vigil to remember the victims. Read the story here.\nOne of the students who was at the school at the time of the shooting said her boyfriend saved her life when she froze. He helped her jump over a cliff to escape.\n“It was horrible. I was hyperventilating. I could barely move my legs. He had to drag me around, basically,” said UCC student Angel Ardito.\nThe president of the college told the crowd that counselors will be available all weekend at the college.\nAngel Ardito goes to #UCC , had to climb down cliff to escape #shooter . She knows 3 injured students. @KIRO7Seattle pic.twitter.com/HiBJxSdoek\n— Joanna Small (@JoannaKIRO7) October 2, 2015", "external_links": ["http://t.co/HiBJxSdoek", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/shooter?src=hash", "http://t.co/RzqR1Zhz55", "https://twitter.com/JoannaKIRO7/status/649795720937996288", "https://twitter.com/KIRO7Seattle", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCCShooting?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/KevinKIRO7/status/649776235086655488", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCCschooting?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCC?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/DouglasCoSO/status/649775759372910592", "https://twitter.com/DouglasCoSO/status/650004128093966336"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:01:46.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
