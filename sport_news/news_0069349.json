New Mocs basketball coach Matt McCall will get on the bus with some good players this season. And if he can get the guys to reach their potential, it should be quite a debut year for McCall. With ten seniors and juniors on the roster, Matt McCall knows he walked into a good situation at UTC. Now it's just a matter of coming together. Said McCall-\"There's no question we have the talent, but we've got to continue to become a team. We need to continue to focus on team, and team being the most important thing. If the best thing for our team is to come off the bench, will I be accepting of that role. All those things go into winning and winning a championship.\" The 6-10 Justin Tuoyo is a game-changer for Chattanooga, and McCall believes he can become super elite by working with his opposite hand. Said McCall-\"Because I think he has unbelievable confidence going to his right making moves. I wanted him to get in that same confidence going to his left. You know repitition is the mother of skill.\" Said Tuoyo-\"I've just been trying to work on my left hand. It has been a long summer. A long summer. So I've worked on everything that I can.\" The Mocs were a running, pressing team last year. And under Coach McCall, they'll be even more up uptempo. Reporter-\"You said this team will press more than last year?\" Said Tuoyo-\"Yes sir. Hard to believe I know. We've been working at it. We've been practicing hard and conditioning for it. That'll be something new for the fans.\" Chattanooga was 22-10 last season, and yet, they lost in the first round of the SoCon tournament. Said Tuoyo-\"Everyone was expecting a championship, and that's what we expect every year. The fact we didn't get that, I feel like we came up short of our goal. Our goal this year is to come home with a championship for the city of Chattanooga.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:44:48.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
