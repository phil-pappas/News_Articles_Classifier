The journey that began with a desire to hone his skills and learn the intricacies of pastry-making took the 25-year-old chef around the world.\nAn excited Toshin said, \"It has been a very soul-searching journey to create the menu, and a space which becomes the perfect backdrop to it. What has been a dream for over a year has finally been realised, and it is a very exciting and honestly emotional moment for me to see it all come together so beautifully.\" The chef promises to serve his patrons macarons, cookies, handcrafted pralines, artisanal chocolates and desserts that are on par with the best in the world.\nWhether digging into a chocolate cookie that is sinfully gooey or biting into a macaron that is lighter than air, every bite at the patisserie guarantees to leave you blissfully satisfied. Toshin says the ingredients used in making the confectionery are pure and original, and every recipe is personally crafted with passion, love and care. While jazz musicians Fareed Haque and Christian Galvez kept the audience hooked, Shriya was among the many who seemed impressed with the delectable desserts on offer at Toshin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:20:00.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
