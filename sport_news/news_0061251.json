He looked at his 68 career wins, his three-straight trips to the national tournament, and saw it all as one massive underachievement. \n“The saying — I don’t know exactly how it goes — but basically, if you keep doing the same thing and expect different results, that’s the definition of insanity or stupidity, or whatever you want to call it,” he said. “I just haven’t reached the goals I’ve wanted to reach.” \nAs Weatherman enters his senior season, he and the ISU coaching staff opted to make a change. He has competed at 174 pounds the last three years, but will be dropping down to 165 for the 2015-16 campaign. \nISU coach Kevin Jackson said Weatherman’s cutting in weight allows for the rest of the team to fill in so they can be at their strongest. The Cyclones enter this season ranked No. 20 by Flowrestling. They finished 14th at last season’s NCAA championships with 39 points, 63 fewer than the national champion Ohio State Buckeyes. \nBut Jackson added that the move also puts Weatherman in a position to wrestle his individual best. The Ballard product is ranked ninth at 165, and Jackson believes he has the necessary tools to compete for an NCAA title. \n“It’s energized him,” Jackson said. “He’s recognized that it’s his last year. He’s not going to compete internationally. This is his last go-around, his last opportunity to accomplish his goals. \n“He hasn’t become an All-American yet. He hasn’t been to the finals. But he has the ability and the technique and the talent to get there and do that.” \nWeatherman has twice come close to earning All-American honors. As a freshman, he reached the quarterfinals at 174 at the NCAA tournament, where another victory would’ve sent him to the semifinals and guaranteed a top-six finish. He lost there, and then again in the round of 12, ending his tournament just a win shy of finishing in the top eight. \nThe next year, Weatherman again reached the blood round at nationals — and, again, he lost, just one victory short of securing a spot on the podium. \nLast season was perhaps the most-devastating of his three-straight trips to the NCAA championships. Weatherman was bounced from the tournament after just two matches. He entered as the 13-seed, and lost both bouts by a combined score of 15-1. \n“I didn’t wrestle well,” Weatherman said. “That’s the worst I’ve wrestled all year long. It left a sour, bitter taste in my mouth all summer. I took a step back and evaluated where I was at and where I wanted to be. \n“And then I took action.” \nAfter taking some time off, Weatherman eased his way back into the practice room. He wasn’t there every day, but he was in the weight room five days out of the week, “putting on some good weight,” he said. \nNear the end of June, he started running more a few times a week. He backed off the weights and began to lean his body down. Weatherman said he was outmanned at 174 at times, but feels a lot bigger and stronger now. \n“He’s been working hard,” said Lelund Weatherspoon, who will fill in at 174 after wrestling 184 last season. “I actually drill with him a lot now. We’ve been going at it. He’s more offensive now. He’s getting to his moves better. He’s more sharp. He’s more focused. He’s determined.” \nStill, Weatherman said he must maintain his new lifestyle all season. He said he’s “paying the price” now, and that will make the victories feel much sweeter. \n“Everyone eats when they’re hungry, and sometimes I can’t,” he said. “That kind of thing. You have to do everything right. Everything has to be perfect.” \nHe reminds himself of this every morning. Back in June, when he started running, he took a sticky-note and wrote “2016 national champ” and stuck it on his nightstand. It’s the first thing he sees every morning when he wakes up. \n“Just keep reminding myself of the ultimate goal,” he said. “I have one year left at it. I need to take full advantage of it.” Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers. In no way do they represent the view of Stephens Media LLC or this newspaper.
