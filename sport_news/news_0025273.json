Willie Desjardins played with a chemistry set Tuesday. It didn’t blow up in his face. \nThe Vancouver Canucks coach is still in the experimental stage and wants to know what he’s got by November. \nThat’s understandable. \nWith 14 games next month and 10 on the road, he knows standings don’t change much after the U.S. Thanksgiving. \nWith rookie Jake Virtanen making his NHL regular-season debut against the lethargic Los Angeles Kings and Jared McCann parked for the night, lines got the test-tube treatment with mixed results in a tidy 3-0 victory and a sweep of a two-game California trip to improve to 3-0-1. \nBrandon Sutter centred the third line with Derek Dorsett and Virtanen while Alex Burrows returned to the top line with Henrik and Daniel Sedin. \nThe second line stayed intact until Sven Baertschi was dropped to the fourth line and replaced by Brandon Prust. He fought for the second-straight night and also set up Adam Cracknell’s goal. \nWho knew? \nAnd Alex Edler wired a slapshot from the left point over the glove of Jonathan Quick. \nAgain, who knew? \nRegardless of the alignments, what Desjardins got was a dedication to defence and the Canucks killed three straight penalties in the third period. The winless Kings had just nine shots through the first two periods and 15 overall and the 36th career shutout for Ryan Miller may have been the easiest of his career. \n\"The majority of those guys (Kings) have won two Stanley Cups, so you know they have the mental game to turn it on, so you've got to stay ready,\" said Miller. \n\"For me, it was watching our guys set up plays the right way and supporting each other that was nice to see. After losing that lead to Calgary, were weren't getting on top of guys and they were stretching the zone on us. We've been much better these last two games and got the right results.\" \nThe big buzz here is Milan Lucic being dropped from the first line and coach Darryl Sutter’s job being in jeopardy. But the buy-in that Desjardins is getting from top to bottom was the biggest story Tuesday. \n\"It wasn't busy for us tonight because Ryan wasn't giving up rebounds,\" said Desjardins. \n\"If he did, he'd be a lot busier. He's just handling everything so clean. It makes a big difference.\" \nWHAT THIS MEANS: \nWhen Jake Virtanen took a direct route and rocked Connor McDavid with a clean and heavy check at the Young Stars Classic in Penticton last month, pulses quickened. \nIf that was an indication of how the prized 2014 first-round draft pick was going to play in a tournament against his peers — and then in the preseason against NHL veterans — the ongoing search for a big right winger to play with an edge and pace as part of the next wave may have ended. \nOf course, that’s saying a lot. \nVirtanen is 19, but he did have two goals and two assists in six preseason games and led the Canucks in hits. And he’s big at 6-foot-1, 208 pounds. \nBut he’s also green. He didn’t break a sweat on his first shift Tuesday in his regular-season debut. He did hit Matt Greene in front of the benches but absorbed a Drew Doughty hit and was knocked off the puck in the defensive zone. He kept searching for where to go offensively with Brandon Sutter and Derek Dorsett. \nI N A WORD: \nDREAMY: Adam Cracknell not only scored his second goal in as many games, he’s one goal away from a career high of three goals in 24 games with St. Louis in 2010-11. \nSLEEPY: Ryan Miller barely broke a sweat and didn’t have to worry about a fatigue factor in back-to-back starts. He faced just five shots in the first period and four in the second. \nPUNCHY: Brandon Prust gave away height and a weight advantage to Andy Andreoff in an early bout, but more than held his own in a prolonged scrap. \nWHAT WE LEARNED: \nJared McCann has done everything to earn the trust of the coach in transitioning to the tough role of a third-line centre . \nIt might not be enough. \nResponsible in his own zone and creative offensively, the 19-year-old rookie has a goal and a plus-2 rating in three games in 10:53 of average ice time. But what happens when Chris Higgins returns from a foot fracture? \nIf Brandon Sutter stays in the middle and Alex Burrows on the top line, McCann could be edged out of a roster spot and returned to junior. \nADVANCED STATS \n31: Length in seconds of Virtanen’s first shift. He never played more than a minute on the third line and his longest shift was 1:15. His shortest was 19 seconds. \n5: The combined season points for Adam Cracknell (2) and Brandon Prust (3), which was one more than Henrik and Daniel Sedin until Henrik assisted on Alex Edler’s goal. \n0: Goals for chemistry-conscious Vrbata through four games. He’s just a fraction off when pulling the trigger. He missed a power-play chance Tuesday. \n56: Distance in feet of Edler's first goal of the season. He not only played the puck off the boards but got all of it to beat Jonathan Quick glove side. « Previous 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:52:24.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
