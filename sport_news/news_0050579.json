New York Mets' Yoenis Cespedes hits an RBI double during the first inning of Game 3 of the National League baseball championship series against the Chicago Cubs Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015, in Chicago. \nNEW YORK (AP) - Mets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes has received a cortisone injection in his sore left shoulder, and the team expects him to be ready for the World Series next week. \nCespedes left Wednesday night's NL Championship Series finale at Chicago in the second inning. The slugger had the injection on Thursday and was told not to participate in baseball activities for 24 hours, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said. Cespedes did not attend Friday's voluntary workout at Citi Field. \nMets manager Terry Collins says: \"We've got it taken care of. The doctors, they said, look, he'll be OK, and so tomorrow we'll find out.\" \nCollins said he didn't ask how Cespedes got hurt. Hitting coach Kevin Long said Cespedes thought he did it doing push-ups. \n\"He didn't do it playing golf. He didn't have a bad sand shot or didn't get stuck in the side of a bunker,\" Collins said.
