Cody Williams finished 18-for-30 for 207 yards, one touchdown and one interception, while junior slot receiver Darren Ambush had a big day, catching nine Williams passes for 107 yards.\nCoastal Carolina redshirt senior quarterback Alex Ross was solid, going 20-for-31 for 282 yards. All-American running back De'Angelo Henderson finished with 91 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries.\nRoss, the reigning Big South Offensive Player of the Year, converted two third downs on the final drive to move the offense into position for Granger's field goal. A 17-yard pass over the middle on third-and-11 from the Monmouth 44-yard line moved the chains, as did a 12-yard pass to Tyrell Blanks on third-and-4 from the 21. The Chanticleers then handed off to Henderson three times before turning the game over to Granger.\nThe game-winning drive began with 3:02 left to play after Monmouth failed to convert on fourth-and-3 from the Coastal 43-yard line as Williams' pass to freshman wide receiver Ugo Ezemma fell incomplete.\n\"We all played well, we had our keys, we did our assignments, we practiced all week really hard to face a really quarterback and I think we held our own,\" senior cornerback Joe Johnson said. \"I think we've proven over the last two weeks that we can play with almost anybody if we put our minds to it. I think we finally picked up enough steam where we have the confidence on defense that we're to go out and get the ball back to our offense. For the most part, we were able to do that today.\nGranger's second field goal of the day, this one from 32 yards, gave Coastal Carolina a 20-13 lead with 3:30 to go in the third quarter, but Monmouth had an answer.\nOn the sixth play of the next drive, Chaney took a handoff, went left, broke a tackle, weaved his way through some traffic, then raced 21 yards for a touchdown. Matt White's extra point tied the game at 20 with 24 seconds to play in the third quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:08:33.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
