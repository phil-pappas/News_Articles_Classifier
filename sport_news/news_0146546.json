On Oct. 8, the board is expected to adopt the fiscal year 2016 budget and tax rate, which sets aside funding for the strategic plan.\nFast-paced growth and an uptick in emergency calls in the area have caused a severe strain in ambulance services provided by Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services, according to the strategic plan.\n“Currently both ambulances stationed in our District are out of station, (assigned to other calls or not available for service) over 40% of the times when another EMS emergency is occurring,” the strategic plan reads. “In those cases, another ambulance from outside this area is required to respond, increasing critical response time.”\nAustin-Travis County EMS has held a longstanding contract with the PFD, which serves roughly 100 square miles in northeastern Travis County. Roughly half of the more than 97,000 residents in the service area live in Pflugerville.\nThe strategic plan states that the PFD would eventually double the number of ambulances immediately available within the district under its contract with Austin-Travis County EMS.\nAnthony Marquardt, president of the Austin-Travis County EMS Association, attended the second of two public hearings on the PFD budget and tax rate. Though he said he had a good conversation with a board commissioner after the meeting, he still has reservations on the strategic plan.\n“We want to serve that community; it’s been with us for a very long time,” he said. “We understand that they can elect to move forwad the way they are. I just hope they realize this is a large commitment.”\nMarquardt also expressed concerns on what role Austin-Travis County EMS will play as the PFD implements its own ambulance service.\n“There are a number of relevant logistical and clinical matters that have not been established including medical direction, protocol, dispatch, mutual aid agreements, or system oversight,” Marquardt said in an Austin-Travis County EMSD Association media release.\nPFD Fire Chief Ron Moellenberg said the fire department conducted a self-analysis to determine service gaps in the area, and it became apparent that their is a growing need for EMS, specifically transport to hospitals. He said Austin-Travis County EMS agreed that the current ambulance service in the area is not enough to serve the growing number of emergency calls.\n“We’ve been watching this,” Moellenberg said. “This is not a new desire to get into the ALS business or ambulance business. It’s a need identified by the strategic plan and we’ve been slowly crawling our way to that point.”\nIn July, the PFD provided funding to train several firefighters to be certified as paramedics. Six more firefighters were trained as paramedics in September, with the goal of having them certified in December 2016, according to the strategic plan.\nThe first in-house ALS ambulance will be in service by next year, according to the strategic plan, with an additional ambulance in service by 2017. In 2018, two additional ambulances will be in service, and two ALS squads will begin in either 2019 or 2020.\nThe proposed fiscal year 2016 budget includes a tax rate of 9.58 cents per $100 property valuation. The ESD operated on a 9.82-cent tax rate last fiscal year. Under state statute, ESDs are prohibited from raising their tax rates higher than 10 cents.\nThe proposed budget includes salaries for up to 12 new firefighter positions, one paramedic program coordinator, one battalion chief, one lieutenant and three training officers.\nA 5 percent salary expense is also included in the proposed budget, as well as a 10 percent increase in employee benefit expenses.\nRoughly 40 percent of revenue is created through a half-cent sales tax in parts of the district, which helps offset property taxes.\nThe proposed budget allocates $374,000 to pay bonds and $15.7 million for the general operating fund. Roughly $1 million is also set aside to pay off general debt like vehicle and facilities payments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:06:30.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
