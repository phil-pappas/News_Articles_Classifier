Here's some reaction from around the nation.\nChip Patterson, CBS Sports: Arkansas was caught off guard by the Aggies on this stage for the second year in a row. After playing the game Bret Bielema wanted to play for 50 minutes, Texas A&M stormed back in the 11th hour and stole a win.\nSam Cooper, Yahoo! Sports: For Arkansas it's another loss in a disappointing start to a season with high expectations. Bret Bielema has done plenty of talking, but hasn't backed it up with three straight losses.\nNick Cole, Saturday Down South: It was the first SEC game of the year for both Texas A&M and Arkansas. So though the Razorbacks entered the game on a two-game skid, as opposed to the 3-0 start for Texas A&M, it was pretty much a blank-slate type of game for both teams, which have had their eyes on a run at the SEC West this season.\nRobert Cessna, The Eagle: Consider it a new Aggie tradition, one somewhat hard on the heart, but certainly satisfying. Texas A&M senior cornerback De'Vante Harris broke up a fourth-down pass intended for Arkansas' Drew Morgan to give the 14th-ranked Aggies a pulsating 28-21 overtime victory Saturday at AT&T Stadium in a Southeastern Conference opener for both teams.\nAubrey Bloom, The Eagle: [Kyle] Allen, like the rest of his teammates, closed the game strong, but while his numbers in the first half were good, the rest of the team came out of the gates a little slow.\nSam Khan Jr., ESPN: This wasn't a pretty victory, as the Aggies' defense was truly tested (and, at times, dominated by Arkansas' offensive line) for the first time this season, and they picked up some bumps and bruises along the way, but it's a critical win for a team trying to earn respect in the SEC West.\nBeau Holder, TexAgs: When the dust finally settled in Arlington on Saturday, Texas A&M had beaten Arkanasas ... in overtime ... for the second year in a row (and scored a fourth straight win in the series, overall).\nBrent Zwerneman, Houston Chronicle: The Aggies were the last ones left grinning in a 28-21 overtime victory over the Razorbacks - the second consecutive year the teams went to overtime. And for the second consecutive year, A&M pulled a rabbit out of its hat for the victory.\nThe No. 14 Aggies improved to 4-0 overall, while Arkansas dropped to 1-3.\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["http://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/rapid-reaction-texas-vs-arkansas/", "http://www.theeagle.com/aggie_sports/football/despite-win-qb-allen-knows-he-must-learn-from-mistakes/article_887fa159-f3e7-5bc9-8ad8-595f6e0a3186.html", "http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/texas-a-m-beats-arkansas-in-ot-after-4th-quarter-comeback-032523709.html", "http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/25318159/texas-am-survives-scare-from-arkansas-in-ot-win-celebrates-in-cowboys-stadium", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "http://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/aggies/article/A-M-strikes-late-tops-Arkansas-in-OT-6532710.php", "http://www.theeagle.com/aggie_sports/football/aggies-making-habit-of-beating-arkansas-in-overtime/article_cff43395-08ef-5bda-8c4a-d1b5d5aca9cd.html", "http://texags.com/s/18284/aggies-celebrate-another-overtime-defeat-of-arkansas", "http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/107312/texas-am-comes-from-behind-to-steal-28-21-win-from-arkansas"], "published": "2015-09-27T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:01:26.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
