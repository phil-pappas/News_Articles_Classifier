Sarkisian was fired Monday, five games into his second season.\nUSC President Max Nikias issued a statement in strong support of Haden, who is under scrutiny for his handling of Sarkisian's problems and the football team's struggles under Sarkisian.\nHaden and interim coach Clay Helton spoke after the Trojans went back to work in their usual morning practice. They will be at No. 14 Notre Dame on Saturday for their annual rivalry game.\nHelton says he won't discuss Sarkisian's private life or behavior.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
