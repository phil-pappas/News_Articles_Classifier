And a good one.\nHe verbally committed to the University of Utah today — the same day the Utes offered a scholarship. His other offers were from Army, Northern Arizona, UNR and Weber State.\nGrabbing a scholarship offer from Utah of the Pac-12 Conference, a top-25 program, was not only a big-time accomplishment for Hubert. It’s also significant for Moapa Valley, the defending state champions who have produced a Division-I recruit in each of the past three seasons.\n“If you can play, they will find you,” Hubert said.\nLast year, he caught 49 passes for 964 yards and 14 touchdowns on offense, and recorded 71 tackles and six interceptions on defense. He also had about 600 return yards.\nWith opposing coaches determined this season to not let Hubert beat them, Moapa Valley has been creative in getting him the ball. On kickoffs, the ball is usually kicked away from Hubert, but teammates quickly lateral the ball back for him to return.\nLast week against Legacy, a large-school opponent, Hubert had nine rushed for 161 yards and three touchdowns. Through five games, he has 11 touchdowns.\nHe was recruited to play wide receiver at Utah.\n“This is all pretty awesome,” he said.\nVerbal commitments are nonbinding until national signing day in early February. That means Hubert can still be recruited by other schools.\nRay Brewer can be reached at 702-990-2662 or ray.brewer@lasvegassun.com .
