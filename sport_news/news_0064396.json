The Hendrick Motorsports driver knows and asserts that he’s been more productive on the type of race track that underpins the Sprint Cup series. \nBut this nugget — Earnhardt has not won on a 1.5-mile surface since 2005 at Chicagoland Speedway — suggests otherwise. \n“I know that 10 years of not winning has got a little bit more to do than luck,” Earnhardt admitted. But, he again insisted, “We have been running good enough.” \nJust a little bit better would go far today at Kansas Speedway in furthering Earnhardt Jr.’s quest for a first championship at NASCAR’s highest level. He will start 15th in the Hollywood Casino 400. \nEntering the second race of the three-event second round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup, he ranks 11th in points, 19 below Brad Keselowski, who tentatively possesses the eighth and final transfer spot. The Chase-eligible field will be narrowed to eight next week at Talladega Superspeedway. A win assures advancement to the ensuing round. \n“As a driver, I think I am a little bit more consistent at the short tracks and obviously the plate tracks we run pretty good at,” said Earnhardt, who won at Talladega and Daytona this season. “I like the mile-and-a-halfs, and I run pretty good at them, but we’re always second third, fourth, or fifth.” \nEarnhardt was in position, he thinks, to recoup a top-10 finish at 1.5-mile Charlotte Motor Speedway last week before he crashed after running through what he and Kyle Busch called an undiscovered oil patch. He’d earlier been impacted and sent into the wall by Carl Edwards. Earnhardt finished 28th. \nHe had been in position to triumph at Kansas this spring, too, but couldn’t get past eventual winner Jimmie Johnson on a final restart and finished third. He led the 2011 Coca-Cola 600 before expending his fuel on the final lap. But despite the consistency and the opportunity, he remains winless over 107 races on 1.5-milers. \nEarnhardt Jr. said his points finishes the past five seasons — seventh, 12th, fifth and eighth since 2011 — suggest consistency, especially with 11 1.5-mile races currently in the 36-race schedule. \n“We’ve maintained a good standing in the points through the regular season. We’re running well, finishing well and we’re up front in a lot of these races,” he said. “I am a better short track driver than I am a mile-and-half driver. I don’t know.” \nEarnhardt Jr. is sixth in top-10 finishes (26) during that span, trailing Matt Kenseth (32), Kevin Harvick and Jimmie Johnson (31), Carl Edwards and Brad Keselowski (29).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:14:27.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
