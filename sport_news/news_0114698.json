It's easy, and it's covered by insurance,\" Gunderson said. \n\"The men who do come in here often are because their wives requested it,\" Avera Family Medicine Dr. Joe Seurer said. \nIt's a request that Seurer says can be life-saving. One of the biggest health mistakes many men make is not regularly going to the doctor for screenings. \n\"Things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes are all things that if we find them early, we can prevent downstream complications, such as heart attacks and strokes,\" Seurer said. \nWhen you're in your thirties, you should see a doctor at least once every other year. One of the main things you should get checked? Your blood pressure. \n\"People who have high blood pressure don't necessarily feel bad, so they wouldn't necessarily come in to be seen,\" Seurer said. \nMen in their 40s should also visit a doctor at least every other year. And If you have health issues or a family history of a disease, you might want to see your doctor more often. \n\"People with high blood pressure uncontrolled for long periods of time are at risk for kidney disease, strokes and heart attacks,\" Seurer said. \nWhen you hit the big 50, your list of recommended screenings increases. \n\"That's when we should start screening typically for prostate cancer, and they should start setting themselves up for a colonoscopy,\" Seurer said. \nWhile Gunderson understands why many men forgo their regular screenings, this Sioux Falls man is relieved to hear he has a clean bill of health. \n\"Maybe it's considered an inconvenience, or they don't want to know. They're afraid to find something out,\" Gunderson said. \"Usually after a checkup, I have more incentive to take a little bit better care of myself. That way, too and get some exercise and eat right.\" Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
