Photograph by: Arlen Redekop , PNG \nThis story should probably begin with one of those happy face emoticons. \nAfter all, it’s about Ben Hutton, the Vancouver Canucks’ rookie defenceman who always seems to be smiling. \nAnd why shouldn’t he? All the 22-year-old Hutton has done is defy the odds by coming straight out of college — save four games with the Utica Comets of the AHL late last season — to earn a National Hockey League roster spot. \n“I have always been a happy guy,” Hutton says with, yes, a big smile. “I get that a lot from people, that I’m always smiling. I tend to smile a lot, apparently. Actually, when I got my teeth knocked out in junior, they started calling me Smiley. I have had that nickname a few times. You can definitely tell when I am happy.” \nWhich seems to be just about all the time. His mom and dad, Janet and Jim, say their son has always been a people person who loves life. \n“Really with Ben, what you see is what you get,” Janet Hutton says over the phone from the family’s home in Prescott, Ont. “There’s no pretence there. If you see him smile, it’s because he is happy. That is who he is.” \nHutton was the surprise of training camp for the Canucks. Defencemen, even the best ones, normally take some time to develop. \nMattias Ohlund, for example, spent three seasons in the Swedish Elite League before joining the Canucks. Fellow Swede Alex Edler spent a season in Kelowna in major junior and the better part of a year in the minors before earning a roster spot in Vancouver. More recently, Chris Tanev played parts of three seasons in the AHL before he found a full-time spot on the Vancouver blue-line. \nHutton is just seven games into his NHL career and realizes that anything can happen, but he has shown no signs that he does not belong. \nThe past few weeks, beginning with last month’s Young Stars tourney in Penticton, are something of a blur for Hutton. He has found it difficult to process all that has happened so quickly. \n“It has been a whirlwind,” he says. “Coming into camp I just wanted to play my game, obviously I wanted to make the team, but I just wanted to play my game and show them that I could play. At the start I was a little bit like, holy cow, look at this, this is Daniel Sedin, or is it Henrik, you know what I mean? I was star-struck. \n“Then I started practising with them and playing a few games with them and it was like, wow, I can skate with these guys, I feel pretty good. I got more and more confident and when it came down to the end I was like I really want to make this team. I was very happy when they told me I was staying. That was probably the biggest my smile has ever been.” \nEveryone, including his teammates, has been talking about his poise. One of Hutton’s strengths has been how composed he remains under pressure. He’s been adept at handling the opposition’s forecheck and moving the puck out of his own end. \n“You watch him with the puck and he is so calm under pressure,” says Tanev, who possesses that quality himself. “He finds outs in our end all the time and he is not just shooting it up the glass or rimming it around the boards. A lot of young guys sort of panic when they get in those situations, but he’ll find the centreman or make a move and skate the puck out of the zone. He is very composed and he is always calm. He’s very impressive.” \nAsked where their son gets his composure, Jim Hutton quickly quips: “That’s from his dad, not his mom.” \nJanet does not disagree: “That’s true,” she says. “Ben has always played that way. He’s pretty laid back and he does get that from his dad. He has never been a person who worries about what is going to happen tomorrow or the next week. \n“His focus is dialed in on today and I think maybe that allows him to just focus on his game.” \nIf his dad takes credit for his poise under pressure, Hutton says his mom deserves credit for his other real strength: his skating. \nHutton has great wheels, another asset that helps him get the puck out of the defensive zone. He looks like a natural on skates, but Hutton jokes that he owes his skating prowess to the patience of his mom, who would not let her young son give up when he could not stay on his feet. \nWhen he was three or four, his mom would take Hutton to the local rink every Monday for public skating. \nInitially, it did not go well. Even with the help of a chair, young Ben had trouble staying upright. \nHe’s been told he did not take his lack of early success well. \n“I couldn’t skate and was one of those competitive, almost bratty kids,” Hutton says. “So when I couldn’t skate I was very frustrated and I came off and threw a massive hissy fit in the locker-room. \n“My mom wouldn’t give up and we kept going every Monday, and eventually I learned how to skate. \n“But I didn’t learn how to stop properly. My mom told me the story how she was skating around and I was racing one of the other kids and I wanted to tell her I won. I came up behind her, but I didn’t know how to stop and I slipped and took the back of her legs out and she went down and hit her head and apparently she was hurting a bit. I was just skating around saying, ‘Sorry, Mom, love you, look at me. I can skate.’ ” \nHutton was a fifth-round draft choice of the Mike Gillis regime in 2012 and after four seasons of Junior A hockey in Ontario, where he was converted from left wing to defence, he went to the University of Maine. \nHis dad thinks the three years his son spent at Maine benefited him both on and off the ice. \n“That college experience has helped form him into the guy he is,” Jim says. \n“He’s a little calmer with the way he handles situations, more mature. He went to college as a young boy and became a man. Not only on the ice, but also as a person.” \nThe decision to leave Maine a year early this past spring was not an easy one for Hutton. He wanted to complete his business degree — something he hopes to do online — but decided it was time to turn pro. \nA few months later as a member of the Canucks, Hutton has no doubt that decision was the right one. He’s now earning an NHL salary of $896,250 US and vows the money won’t change him. \n“Sure, the money’s great,” Hutton says. “But you know it’s not going to be there forever.” \nHutton hasn’t done anything crazy since getting his first NHL paycheque. With the help of fellow Canucks rookie Jake Virtanen, Hutton just got a car deal with Abbotsford Chrysler and took possession of a new Jeep. \nHe has spent his spare time doing things like playing golf at the Stanley Park pitch and putt and visiting the Vancouver Aquarium. One day last week, Virtanen took Hutton on a tour of his hometown of Abbotsford, which included a stop at Virtanen’s parents’ house for dinner. \n“My parents loved him,” Virtanen says. \nHutton’s proud parents — who recently made their first trip to Vancouver to watch Ben play in the Canucks’ home-opener — are confident success will not spoil their son. \nJanet was encouraged recently when Ben demonstrated his frugal side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:11:29.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
