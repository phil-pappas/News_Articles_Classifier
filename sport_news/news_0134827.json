Staff file photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow CANTON — Kelley Hartman finished with a game-high 17 kills, and defending Class state champion Sequoyah cruised past Northgate 25-10, 25-15, 25-21 on Saturday to return to the final four. The third-seeded Lady Chiefs (24-14) will travel to second-seeded Cambridge (31-11) on Wednesday. It will be the Area 7 rivals’ fourth meeting, with Sequoyah winning a three-setter during the regular season and Cambridge winning twice in the area tournament.Sixth-seeded Northgate (28-19) led 10-8 in the second set of Saturday’s match, but Sequoyah scored seven straight points off Karen Morris’ serve, and 12 of the next 13. “We made some errors there and (Northgate) was playing well,” Sequoyah coach John Edwards said, “but I thought we did a good job running what we were supposed to, keeping our composure, and things started going our way again.”The Lady Chiefs ran away with the first set when they went on a 6-0 run on Lauren Hartman’s serve to extend their lead to 18-6. The set ended on back-to-back kills by Kelley Hartman.“I don’t think there’s anything else I can say about them,” Edwards said of the Hartman sisters. “I think this must be the sixth or seventh year that I’ve had a Hartman on my team, because their older sister was here, too, and I’m not ready to see them go yet, and they’re not ready to stop playing.”Kelley and Lauren Hartman are seniors committed to play volleyball at South Alabama next year. Their older sister, Maggie, is entering her junior season playing basketball at Harvard.Northgate was most competitive in the third set, where Katie Stanton had seven of her team-leading 12 kills, but the match ended on a Northgate serving error, wrapping up the straight-sets victory for Sequoyah. “We talked about being (in the final four) and having that capability,” Edwards said. “Whether or not it would happen, with all the new pieces on this team, (we didn’t know). But they’ve been OK with their role, become closer as a team, pushed each other in practice and become better every time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:13:56.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
