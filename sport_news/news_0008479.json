Look at any defensive metric, and there is a good chance the Broncos are at or near the top of the list. Denver has forced 14 turnovers, the most in the N.F.L. And the Broncos defense has allowed only seven touchdowns this year, second best in the N.F.L. to the Jets (who played one fewer game). Denver’s defense has even chipped in when it comes to scoring, as the Broncos defense has three touchdowns this year, tied for the league lead with Atlanta and Arizona. And, more important, all three defensive scores have come in critical situations. In Week 1, with the Broncos trailing the Ravens, 13-9, in the final seconds of the third quarter, Aqib Talib took a Joe Flacco pass 51 yards for a touchdown. Four days later, Bradley Roby scored on a 21-yard fumble to win the game in Kansas City. And on Sunday, leading, 9-7, with seven minutes remaining and the Raiders in field goal range, Chris Harris intercepted Derek Carr and took the pass back 74 yards for the game-clinching score. While Peyton Manning is failing to meet his typically lofty standards, his team still sports the best record in the league, thanks to perhaps the best defense Manning has ever had.
