(Photo: Charlie Litchfield/The Register) \nTom Brands and his Iowa wrestling program secured key commitments from two of the state's elite wrestlers in Lisbon's Carter Happel and Bettendorf's Jack Wagner on Tuesday. \nHappel, a three-time state champion, was ranked as the nation's No. 25 senior prospect by Flowrestling this summer. Happel, who projects to wrestle at 141 pounds in college, is 154-1 during his high school career in Iowa, including his 58-0 mark as a junior. Three backpoints from the Night of Conflict \nHappel was named to The Register's first Iowa Eight wrestling team this summer . Happel picked the Hawkeyes over Northern Iowa. \n\"He puts in more time than anybody I've ever coached (in 38 years) probably. (Four-time undefeated state champion and two-time NCAA champion) Jeff McGinness was right there. He was really dedicated and spent a lot of time at it, but Carter's even more thorough with his training habits and things like that. As good as he is right now, he knows he needs to get better. He knows what it takes and I don't have to motivate him to do much,\" Lisbon coach Brad Smith told the Register in July.

Wagner selected Iowa over Nebraska, Minnesota, Virginia Tech and Iowa State. Wagner was also an Iowa Eight member . \n\"I've grown up a Hawkeye fan and have [the] mentality of always wanting to score and be physical,\" Wagner said. \"I want to be in that environment.\" 621 CONNECT 34 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1LIXnLC MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:59:41.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
