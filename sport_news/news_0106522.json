The 25-14, 25-20, 25-21 sweep of the San Bernardino Valley Wolverines gave the Coyotes momentum heading into the second half of the season, said Cerro Coso head coach Kim Young. “We tried to stay consistent, and we played excellent,” she said. “It paid off, and I knew it would.” The Coyotes rallied behind strong performances by outside hitters Miranda Brater (.360 hitting, 10 kills) and Kristel Teuscher (.250, six kills), and both dug out 12 attacks apiece in the match. As a team, Cerro Coso had 28 kills, as the Coyotes spread the ball offensively. From the serving line, Metzli Heck and Monica Gutierrez each had five of the team’s 13 aces against the Wolverines. “We’ve seen a lot of success with serve and serve-receive,” Young said. “We’re always focused on those two elements. We’re just really trying to dial in on them as the season continues.” Up next, the Coyotes (2-18, 1-4 Foothill Conference) will visit the College of the Desert Roadrunners (7-9, 4-1) in Palm Desert. On Oct. 7, the two squads faced off at Cerro Coso, where the Roadrunners rallied back from a one-set deficit to win in four. Young asserts that now, the Coyotes know better. Practice has gone smoother, and the team chemistry is the highest it has been this year. “College of the Desert didn’t do anything that we thought were out of the ordinary,” Young said. “We just need to play our game. Our team goal is that we get ahead and stay ahead.” By Christopher Livingston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:38:18.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
