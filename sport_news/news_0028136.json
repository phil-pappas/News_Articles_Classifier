But he had a plan - if his players followed it - that could work.\n\"You have to be real disciplined to play Cox,\" defensive back Tracy Martin said. \"They told us that the first thing (Cox) showed to hit it.\"\nThe seventh-ranked SunDevils (5-1) followed the plan, punishing Johnson, DeMasi and anyone else who touched the ball as they handed the No. 5 Falcons their first loss of the season with a 27-14 victory.\n\"This win means everything for us for the playoffs and everything for our power rankings,\" said Salem coach Robert Jackson, whose team came in ranked ninth in the Group 5A South Region. \"Our goal is to finish with the No. 1 seed like we have for the last two years... We needed a win for ourselves.\"\nCox, playing its second game in five days, had the momentum early. Salem punted after its first possession, and the Falcons - led by Johnson and DeMasi - moved the ball 65 yards into SunDevil territory. But a fumble on the next play was picked up by linebacker Marcus Joyner, who raced 87 yards for the touchdown.\n\"I saw the ball come out and I just took it down the field,\" he said. \"It was right there for me and I was gone.\"\nThe Cox coaching staff could only shake their heads.\n\"We set the tone like we wanted to in the first drive,\" Cox coach Bill Stachelski said, \"and we got it right down there and fumbled.\"\nSalem padded its lead on quarterback Tyler Watson-Jones' 13-yard touchdown pass to Devante Williams for a 14-0 margin.\nThe SunDevils had a chance to score again before the half but were stopped at the Falcons' 31 with 1:44 left. Johnson guided the Falcons downfield and threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Josh Herslow with 33 seconds remaining to cut the deficit to 14-7.\nCox attemped a reverse on the first play of the second half, but wide receiver Tayvion Robinson's pass was intercepted by Taeyonn Reynolds.\n\"That was something that we thought was there, and it was there but we asked a freshman to do something that he wasn't accustomed to doing,\" Stachelski said. \"But that's on me but that really took our momentum away. That was not the way to start the second half.\"\nOn the next play, Salem running back Malik Butts scored on an 18-yard run. The SunDevils missed the two-point conversion but led 20-7.\nCox (5-1) had a chance to score midway through the third quarter, but Martin picked off Johnson at the Salem 5.\n\"I was in Cole's eyes and I got underneath and picked it off,\" Martin said. \"We knew we were going to have a tough game but we showed up and did what we were taught and we won.\"\nLarry Rubama, 757-446-2273, larry.rubama@pilotonline.com , Twitter@LHRubama\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
