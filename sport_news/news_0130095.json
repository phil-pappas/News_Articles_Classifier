(AP) - The four major candidates in the Louisiana governor's race are squaring off in their first televised debate together, with attack ads intensifying as the Oct. 24 election nears.\nThe debate is Thursday night at WDSU-TV in New Orleans.\nThough a previous forum aired on television, Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter didn't participate.\nHis three chief rivals - Republican Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards - have criticized Vitter as skipping most events where he can't see questions in advance.\nAlso in the debate are two lesser-known candidates: Democrat Cary Deaton and Jeremy Odom, an independent.\nOutside of the New Orleans area, people can watch the 6 p.m. debate on KALB-TV in Alexandria, KAQY-TV in Monroe and KTBS-TV in Shreveport.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
