Well, you'll probably have to wait until November.\nAdChoices The Week 8 slate has a handful of games that might shake things up, but for the most part only a major upset or two will change the picture as it now appears. Here are the five games that have the most potential to have an impact.\nNoon ET, ABC | 5dimes line: Clemson by 2½\n© Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports This is only the second road game for the Tigers, and the first one at Louisville was a closer call than their fans would have liked. The Hurricanes, meanwhile, still have plenty to play for — weekly aerial banners notwithstanding. Only one of their two losses was in ACC competition, and that one to Florida State was outside the Coastal Division.\nAll that said, Clemson still owns a considerable talent edge, and that talent has been meshing well since the Louisville escape. QB Deshaun Watson can still be INT-prone, and he must watch out for Miami CB Artie Burns who has swiped five passes already this year, but Watson and top WR Artavis Scott are capable of making the big hookup at any time. Hurricanes QB Brad Kaaya has only been picked once in 2015, but his offensive unit isn't as explosive. He can expect heat from Clemson DE Shaq Lawson.\n7:30 p.m. ET, Fox | 5dimes line: USC by 3\n© Kim Raff/AP Photo Utah quarterback Travis Wilson (7) hands the ball off to Utah running back Devontae Booker (23) in the first half of an NCAA college football game against California on Oct. 10 in Salt Lake City. Utah is two games clear of the Pac-12 South field. Although they can in theory absorb a loss and still win the conference title, the Utes would rather not put that hypothesis to the test. The Trojans can only spoil at this juncture, but they'd love to start now.\nThough the backfield duo of QB Travis Wilson and TB Devontae Booker have been outstanding for the Utes, the defense has stood out every week. The Utes are keeping opponents under 20 points per game while enjoying a plus-two average turnover margin, best in the FBS. USC QB Cody Kessler and WR JuJu Smith-Schuster have home-run potential, but the Trojans' much younger defense needs to plug some leaks.\n7 p.m. ET, ESPN | 5dimes line: Mississippi by 6\n© Justin Ford Mississippi Rebels quarterback Chad Kelly (10) carries the ball against the Fresno State Bulldogs at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. This, quite simply, is an eliminator in the SEC West. The Memphis loss was damaging to the Rebels' overall résumé, but they still own that valuable potential head-to-head tiebreaker against Alabama in the league. The Aggies have no such victories in hand and really need to acquire one.\nThe biggest unknown as game time approaches is the availability of Ole Miss DT Robert Nkemdiche, who is going through concussion protocols. Even if he isn't cleared to play, A&M QB Kyle Allen will be feeling the heat as he looks to overcome last week's nightmarish outing against Alabama. Rebels QB Chad Kelly didn't do his best work a week ago, either, and Aggies DEs Myles Garrett and Daeshon Hall will try to keep him off his game.\n3:30 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN2 | 5dimes line: Oklahoma by 12\n© Tony Gutierrez/AP Photo Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield (6) throws a pass as he warms up before an NCAA college football game against Texas Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, in Dallas. The Sooners got a nice bounce-back result last week at Kansas State, but their puzzling Texas loss still has them playing catchup in the Big 12. Texas Tech is in an even deeper hole. The Red Raiders had the misfortune of drawing TCU and Baylor in their first two conference games, but they could still be dangerous despite largely going through the motions against Kansas a week ago.\nThere's the obvious subplot of OU QB Baker Mayfield taking on his former school for the first time. But the Sooners' best weapon might be TB Samaje Perine against the Texas Tech defense that hasn't exactly been airtight against the run. Red Raiders QB Patrick Mahomes can sling it around with the best of them, but he'll need help from backfield mate DeAndre Washington to keep the throwing lanes clear.\n7 p.m. ET, ESPNU | 5dimes line: LSU by 17\n© Gerald Herbert/AP Photo LSU running back Leonard Fournette (7) carries against Florida defensive back Keanu Neal (42) in the second half of an NCAA college football game in Baton Rouge, La., Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015. Everybody is aware of it, but the elements are in place for the Tigers to be bitten by the dreaded letdown. LSU is coming off the big Florida win, and there's an idle week on tap before the colossal Nov. 7 showdown with Alabama. The Hilltoppers, on the other hand, have a golden opportunity. A win in Baton Rouge would be the most significant for Conference USA this season and would put WKU in the conversation for a major bowl.\nHilltoppers QB Brandon Doughty is well on his way to a second consecutive C-USA player of the year honor. He spreads the ball among a terrific receiving corps that includes primary deep threat Taywan Taylor and TE Tyler Higbee. WKU doesn't present much of a ground game, however, so the attack might struggle against LB Kendell Beckwith and LSU's very fast back seven. Then there's the matter of trying to contain Tigers TB Leonard Fournette, a feat that has yet to be accomplished in 2015. Tigers QB Brandon Harris has also made some long connections by air with WR Malachi Dupre, but the intermediate passing game could still use some work before the challenging stretch drive.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:39:32.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
