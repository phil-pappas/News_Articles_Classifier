So it’s a good situation to have … I think preseason, through August, I thought those guys really performed well. It wasn’t a surprise for me, for us, but at the same time, prior to that there were questions about who our running back was gonna be. So it’s just, I guess, not a pleasant surprise, but it’s a good feeling to know that we have depth and we’ve got quality at running backs -- for years to come being that those guys are so young.”\nLondon (372 yards, 4.7 per carry, three touchdowns) will start Saturday night for No. 4 MSU (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) at Rutgers (2-2, 0-1) and Scott (376 yards, 6.2 average, four touchdowns) will appear early. And then Warner will see if a “hot back” emerges, as Scott did last week in a 146-yard, two-touchdown outburst against Purdue.\nMonty Madaris could see bigger role with offense “They're definitely great backs,” Rutgers senior linebacker Quentin Gause told the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press of the Spartans’ runners this week. “They run hard and watching the film, they know how to get through that hole. With them, we have to play really great run defense and everyone is going to have to do their job.”\nWarner compared the Scarlet Knights’ 4-3 scheme to Western Michigan’s, with more aggression.\n“We’re always gonna expect pressure,” Warner said. “And so that’s what we’re getting ready for, variations of pressure they can bring in the run game and the pass game. They’re not gonna sit back and let us run the ball down their throat, I know that. Nobody’s gonna do that in our game, so that’s what we’re always being ready for.”\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @joerexrode .
