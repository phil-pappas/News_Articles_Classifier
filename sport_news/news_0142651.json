Highly-regarded assistant coach Luke Walton will fill his seat while he is out, and only time will tell whether Warriors fans should be concerned about the prospect of having someone of his relative inexperience at the helm. For all we know, Kerr could be back in no time. Or, perhaps, not.\nThis much is safe to say: the Warriors sure do miss former Warriors associate head coach/New Orleans Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry right about now. Make no mistake, though, Walton's imprint on this group - which I chronicled during the Finals - has been significant. Kerr, in fact, thought so highly of Walton's candid insights and acumen last season that he made his mantra - \"When we don't do stupid (expletive), we're really (expletive) good.\" - a theme of sorts down the stretch. And in this particular scenario, Kerr clearly saw the notion of suffering through the back pain as, well, stupid.\nKerr isn’t the complaining sort, so it spoke volumes when he showed up at Las Vegas summer league in July with the kind of grimace and gait that made it abundantly clear that he was miserable. I spoke with his wife, Margot, at the time, saying hello briefly while asking if they had been enjoying the glow and shine of their memorable moment. She shook her head and frowned. Kerr’s back situation, quite clearly, was a bigger deal than most had realized.\nUSA TODAY\nAndre Iguodala says he's OK with being the Warriors' Sixth Man\nKerr spoke about his back on Tuesday at the team’s practice facility, when I asked if the experience with his back had taken any of the fun out of his championship summer.\n“It took all of the fun out of the summer,” Kerr conceded. “Yeah. I did not have any fun over the summer, which is unfortunate given that we just won the damned title. I was looking forward to a lot of fun, but it’s all part of it and I’ll be ok.”\nIf not now, apparently, then in due time.\n“At this point, the most important thing is to make sure Steve is healthy, completely recovered and ready for not only the rigors of a long NBA season, but day-to-day life in general,” Warriors General Manager Bob Myers in the team's statement. “We don’t anticipate the recovery process will be long term, but as of today we don’t know the exact timeframe. We’ll evaluate his progress daily and provide updates as necessary.”\nUSA TODAY' Sports' Sam Amick discusses Golden State Warriors at media day.", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1FAlGLd", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4517951913001_thumbnail-for-video-4517883959001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4517951914001_video-still-for-video-4517883959001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/warriors/2015/09/28/warriors-stephen-curry-steve-kerr/72986654/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4517951914001_video-still-for-video-4517883959001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5f77ad89ad578b3b7d93cfba997ef5be270e0183/c=353-0-2420-2067/local/-/media/2015/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635790570906988124-USP-NBA--Playoffs-Golden-State-Warriors-at-Clevela.1.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/nba/2015/09/29/73022714/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/warriors/2015/09/28/andre-iguodala-warriors-sixth-man/72996318/", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4517951914001_video-still-for-video-4517883959001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2db5221b7abb1dc6657c65bb8f6c6360f34af4c/c=360-0-2883-2523/local/-/media/2015/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635790547632106927-USP-NBA--Playoffs-Golden-State-Warriors-at-Clevela.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:06:40.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
