She's such a great champion and has been playing quite well the last month or so. \n\"I'm happy with the way I played, though, and I'm really happy I was able to beat her.\" \nOn her next opponent, Jankovic added: \"She's a different player to Venus - she's so solid, she runs a lot of balls down and doesn't really give you any free points. \n\"So I have to play really aggressive and try not to make any mistakes, and we'll see if I'm going to be able to win.\" \nSecond seed Kerber needed just 71 minutes to thrash Sam Stosur 6-2 6-2. \nAustralia's Stosur had triumphed in three of their five previous meetings but was no match for her German opponent on this occasion, with Kerber now just one win away from sealing her place at the WTA Finals in Singapore. \n\"I'm feeling good after this match - I was playing good tennis,\" Kerber said. \"It's always tough to play Sam. She's a great champion and a great opponent. So I'm really happy about my performance. \n\"I'm not thinking too much about needing one more win tomorrow, though. It's going to be another day and another match, and I'm just going to try and play some good tennis and win the final here.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:14:21.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
