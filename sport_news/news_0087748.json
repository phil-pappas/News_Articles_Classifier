Roy Hodgson complained he gave the ball away too much for the national side last year and he did so on a few occasions on Friday. \nBut when he charged at the Estonian defence, he looked like a young Wayne Rooney did in his pomp and he deservedly won the man of the match award. \nEngland will come up against tougher opposition than this - and the Lithuanian side they will play in their final Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday - but they now have nine wins from nine matches and no one can complain about that. \nIf they beat Lithuania in Vilnius, they will become the sixth side in history to qualify for the European Championship with a pristine qualifying record. \nRooney, out with an ankle injury, received a huge round of applause when he collected a golden boot from Sir Bobby Charlton before kick-off for breaking his scoring record. \nAfter the pair retreated to the stands, the cheers gave way to silence as a dull opening half ensued. \nWalcott volleyed at Mihkel Aksalu and Barkley fluffed two chances to beat the Estonia goalkeeper. \nA brief moment of alarm was caused in the home defence when Taijo Teniste gained space in the box, but Chris Smalling blocked his shot. \nEngland were dominating possession but there was little excitement. Those who popped off early for their half-time pie missed the breakthrough, however. \nJust when it looked like the Estonians had managed to hold out for the first half, Barkley sliced open the visitors' defence to find Walcott, who took one touch before rolling the ball past Aksalu. \nBarkley brought the home fans to the edge of their seats with a 40-yard sprint but he was dispossessed when he had options at either side of him. \nThe midfielder redeemed himself somewhat moments later when he drifted in from the right flank past two Estonians and unleashed a powerful left-foot drive that whistled by Aksalu's far post. \nBarkley landed his next shot - another high drive - on goal but the Estonian stopper scrambled to his right and tipped it over the bar. \nHodgson brought Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jamie Vardy on to inject some life into the game and it was the Leicester forward who helped put the win beyond doubt five minutes from time. \nVardy latched on to Kane's flick-on from a long punt up field from Joe Hart and he squared for Sterling, who had the simplest of finishes. \nTWEET OF THE MATCH \n\"Hard to see beyond England for next summer's Euros\" - Gary Lineker is convinced. \nPLAYER RATINGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:59:37.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
