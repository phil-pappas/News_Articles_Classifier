Take our quiz to find out.\nOregon voters approved Measure 91, legalizing recreational marijuana for adults, in November 2014. Possessing the drug became legal July 1, 2015, and now retail sales are getting under way as part of an early sales program approved by the 2015 Legislature.\nLawmakers were concerned that consumers would have nowhere to legally buy pot for a long time after possession became legal. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission, the agency tasked with regulating the new industry, won't have a permanent retail program ready to go until late 2016.\nSo legislators approved a temporary program that kicks off Oct. 1 -- this Thursday.\nCredit for the correct quiz answers goes to Noelle Crombie , The Oregonian/OregonLive's expert on all things marijuana; Jeff Mapes , our senior politics reporter, who followed the Legislature's many adjustments; and George Rede , who covers workplace issues.\nWant to learn more? We'll be rolling out lots of coverage this week, especially Thursday as sales begin. You'll find stories at oregonlive.com .
