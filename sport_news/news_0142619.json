Start School Later endorses the recommendations made by these health groups, and advocates for school start times, at minimum, after 8 a.m. for all grade levels. \nWritten by Contributed · Filed Under Schools \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:32:18.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
