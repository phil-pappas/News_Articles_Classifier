Appealing Tale, fresh from some sharp efforts at Del Mar and Santa Anita, went to the front very early in the $400,000, Grade 2 Kelso Handicap and stayed there. \nWith jockey Joe Talamo sitting quietly most of the way, they set fractions of 46.35 seconds for the half mile and 1 minute, 09.89 seconds for six furlongs before stopping the clock in 1 minute, 34.86 seconds for the mile on a sloppy and sealed track. \nThe victory prompted West Coast trainer Peter Miller to report by telephone, \"\"It's on to the Breeders' Cup next. We'll probably cross enter in the Breeders' Cup Sprint and the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. But, we'll probably lean more on the Dirt Mile,\" he said. \nHonor Code, the winner of Saratoga's Whitney Handicap and Belmont's Metropolitan Handicap, was sent postward as the 3 to 5 favorite with jockey Javier Castellano. They tried to come from sixth in the field of seven but fell 3-3/4 lengths short of Appealing Tale and Red Vine, the winner of Monmouth's Majestic Light. \nHall of Fame trainer Shug McGaughey, speaking of the Classic, said Honor Code will be \"fine\" for that race. Jockey Javier Castellano said Honor Code \"gave me a strong finish, but I couldn't get there.\" \nFlower Bowl \nAfter a rather disappointing summer, Ken and Sarah Ramsey's home-bred Stephanie's Kitten captured the 38th running of the $500,000 Grade 1 Flower Bowl Stakes for fillies and mares—with some help from a rabbit. \nThe mile and a quarter race was moved from the Inner Turf Course out to the Widener for better footing after two days of deluge. Soft footing or not, the home bred daughter of Kitten's Joy is now eligible for the $2 million Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf. \nTrainer Chad Brown sent out Stephanie's Kitten, Danza Cavallo and Regardez. Each ran as a separate betting interest. \nDanza Cavallo and Castellano cut out all the pace before Stephanie's Kitten and Irad Ortiz came after them in the stretch with Ortiz looking for his fourth win of the day. \nAfter running head-to-head past the 1/16 pole, Stephanie's Kitten pulled away to a 1-1/2-length win over Danza Cavallo with Mutatis Mutandis, making her first start in North America 2-1/4 lengths back in third. \nAfter the Flower Bowl, Brown was pleased with the mare's performance and the soft ground. He did not make a firm commitment to the Breeders' Cup race. He said, \"A combination of her currently training as well as she has all year and catching soft ground the last two starts resulted in her turning the season around. \n\"Her last two breezes were as good as I've seen her breeze in a year. You look at her — she's run at the Grade 1 level from age 2 to 6 — that's very rare,\" he concluded. \nFrizette \nNickname, making her third lifetime start, earned a spot in the $2 million, Grade 1 Breeders' Cup for Juvenile Fillies when she stalked the pace set by the favored She's all Ready and then went on to win the $400,000, Grade 1 Frizette at one mile on the main track. \nThe Steve Asmussen trainee beat six rivals running the distance in 1 minute, 37.76 seconds. She and Castellano were 3-1/2 lengths ahead of Nemoralia. She's All Ready was another 1-1/4 lengths back in third. \nWhen asked about Nickname going to Keeneland for the Breeders' Cup, Asmussen said, \"We'll make sure she's 100%.\" Then, he continued, while beaming, \"I do know the last time we won the Frizette was with My Miss Aurelia, who went on and won the Juvenile Fillies.\" \nChampagne \nJockeys are beginning to learn 'Don't give up a mount on a stake horse. If you do, Joe Bravo is liable to get on it and beat you.' \nThis was the case when Javier Castellano had a choice between Ralis, Saratoga's Grade 1 Hopeful Stakes winner, and Greenpointcrusader, who broke his maiden on the Upstate track a week before the Hopeful. \nTrainer Dominick Schettino called for Bravo to ride the son of Bernardini in the $500,000, Grade 1 Champagne Mile. 1 minute and 36.25 seconds after the gate opened, Greenpointcrusader was guaranteed a stall in the $2 million, Grade 1 Breeders' Cup Juvenile on the Saturday (Oct. 31) card at Keeneland. \nWhen Ralis (8 to 5) failed to make the board, the result of the Champagne became a long shot affair with the first four finishers being Greenpointcrusader (6 to 1), Sunny Ridge (23 to 1), Portfolio Manager (12 to 1) and Sail Ahoy (8 to 1). \nA bettor who put down $2 on the superfecta and had them in the correct order, collected $11,715 — a sum that could cover the expenses on a trip to the Breeders' Cup. \n'Jersey Joe' Bravo is very serious about his riding. But, when he wins a major stake, the Long Branch, N.J. native can become on of the happiest people ever to grace a winners' circle. \nHere are his comments after Greenpointcrusader won the $500,000, Grade 1 Champagne Stakes that earned the colt a start in the $2 million, Grade 1 Breeders' Cup Juvenile at the end of October. \n\"The stride this big boy has, man, that was fun. The last sixteenth of a mile, I kind of geared him down. I didn't really want to get to the bottom of him. How great is this Breeders' Cup going to be this year? Every day is a blessing, that's all.\" \nFor current equestrian news see Horse News or check out the online version of the print edition.
