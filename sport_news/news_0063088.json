(Photo: Lisa Bernheim/News Journal) \nMANSFIELD — If the high school football playoffs started today, seven from the area would get to play. \nBut the playoffs aren't starting this weekend. There are three games left in the regular season, so there is plenty of time for movement into the top eight of a region, which is good news for six teams on the bubble, and time to fall out of one of those coveted spots for the aforementioned seven. \nHere's a closer look at the scenarios — with the help of JoeEitel.com — leading into Week 8 of the regular season: \nLucas \nThe Cubs are 7-0 and first in Division VII, Region 24. Third-place Hicksville is a full two average points behind the Cubs, as Lucas has more than double the points of eighth-place Tiffin Calvert, 8.9898 to 4.0929. Of course, they control their own destiny, but even if they don't beat Danville in Week 9, it's pretty hard to see a scenario where the Cubs aren't playing in Week 11. \nWynford \nLike Lucas, the Royals are leading Division VI, Region 20 at 6-1 with 12.5571 points. They control their own destiny with games against 3-4 Upper Sandusky, 5-2 Buckeye Central and 1-6 Bucyrus. Wynford should be back in the playoffs for the 14th time. \nAshland \nThe Arrows are third in Division III, Region 8 with a 6-1 record and 14.8857 points, but they do not control their own destiny. Wins over 2-5 Clear Fork, 4-3 Madison and 5-2 Lex should be enough and wins over two of the three could be enough to make the postseason. \nColonel Crawford \nThe Eagles are also third in Division VI, Region 20 with a 6-1 record and 10.0000 points. Crawford does not control its own destiny, but it is close. It can score nice points with wins over 5-2 Buckeye Central, 3-4 Upper Sandusky and 3-4 Carey. \nBuckeye Central \nThe Bucks are fifth in the same region as Lucas, and they most definitely control their own destiny if they can win-out. Of course, that's easier to write than accomplish as their final three games are with Wynford, Crawford and 4-3 Mohawk. Could a six-win BC squad make the field? This year's region isn't the strongest, so there is hope if things don't go well for the Bucks over the next couple of weeks. \nHillsdale \nThe 5-2 Falcons are hanging in the Division VI, Region 19 standings at seventh with 9.3786 points. The next two weeks will tell the tale for Hillsdale as it has 6-1 Norwayne, 6-1 Chippewa and 1-6 Dalton to close out the season. \nFredericktown \nThe 6-1 Freddies are eighth in Division VI, Region 21 with 8.6934 points. They have 4-3 Highland on Friday followed by 2-5 Northmor and 5-2 Cardington, so if they win-out, it will be hard to keep the Freddies out of the playoffs. \nBubble Teams \nMansfield Senior is tied for 12th in Division II, Region 5 with 8.3857 points, but just an average of 2.5 points away from the final spot. And with big-point games looming with 6-1 Wooster, 5-2 Lexington and 4-3 Madison, the Tygers would be in a good place with three more victories and maybe even two more. \nLexington is 10th with 9.15 points and Madison 11th with 9.1286 points in Division III, Region 8. Both have Mansfield Senior and Ashland left. If they can beat them both, playoff spots looks promising. If not, the season ends after Week 10. \nShelby is 4-3 and 10th in Division IV, Region 13 with 7.0786 points, but 2.7 points away from eighth. The Whippets likely can't move on if they don't beat 5-2 Bellevue in Week 9. \nGalion is 4-2 as the computer rankings don't recognize the Columbus Crusaders. The Tigers are 10th in Division V, Region 16, only 0.6 points shy of eighth place with 8.2222 points. The problem is Galion doesn't have a lot of strong opponents down the stretch and will really need the teams they've beaten to keep winning. Best of the remaining three opponents is 4-3 North Union. \nCardington is 5-2 and 11th in Division VI, Region 21 with 6.6571 points. The Pirates are 2.3 points away from a playoff spot right now. While beating 0-7 East Knox won't help the cause much, 4-3 Highland and 6-1 Fredericktown certainly will, which means Cardington must finish strong to make the playoffs for the first time. \nRob McCurdy covers high school sports at the News Journal and can be reached at rmccurdy@gannett.com or 419-521-7241.
