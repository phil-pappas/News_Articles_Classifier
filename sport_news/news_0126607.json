It’s my job and what I get paid to do. It’s what the guys expect from me. \n“It doesn’t matter, it really doesn’t. I know that’s maybe a crazy answer. You think I’m BS-ing you, but it is the truth. I am here to play well and help this team win. That is my job and all I can focus on.” \nMathews did as much last Friday, leading the Ticats to a lopsided victory against the visiting Roughriders. As such, he was recognized as one of the CFL’s top performers of the week. To no surprise, Mathews, subbing for the rest of the 2015 season for an injured Zach Collaros, shrugged at that as well. He claimed not to know until he was told by centre Mike Filer during practice. \n“I don’t look at that stuff,” Mathews said. “I don’t think a lot of guys do. I think the whole thing is, ‘Hey, good, we won a game.’ We move on to Montreal and we have to do the same this week.” \nThe storyline heading into a visit on Sunday to Montreal got a bit juicier when the Als, who have been tripping over themselves on and off the field, acquired Glenn. At 36, Glenn has thrown a pass for five other CFL organizations, including Hamilton, which employed him from 2009-11. His best years are in the past, and whether his presence on the Alouettes roster during the final month of the season can help Montreal get into the playoffs is disputable. Still, Ticats defensive coordinator Orlondo Steinauer figured on a challenge despite his group making short work of Glenn last week. In what would be his final appearance for Saskatchewan, Glenn was replaced by Brett Smith to start the third quarter after an ineffective first half. In his career, Glenn is 14-8 against the Tiger-Cats, his best career record versus any opponent. \n“Definitely, we would be shocked not to see him,” Steinauer said. “We’re just going to focus on ourselves, but we’re definitely aware they have a veteran presence (in Glenn). \n“He can still win you football games. I’ve always looked at Kevin as a guy who is going to get you to the playoffs and anything can happen once you are in. He (has) kind of that consistency.” \nAustin made a move on Wednesday, picking up Canadian defensive back Mike Edem from Montreal for a sixth-round pick in the 2016 CFL draft and conditional seventh-round pick in 2017. Edem, an East Division all-start when he was a rookie in 2013, has played in four games for Montreal this season. \nBut no big trade splashes for Austin, whose team is 9-5 and owns a share of first place in the East with the Toronto Argonauts. There should be a boost on offence this weekend as receiver Andy Fantuz returns from an elbow injury. As much as Mathews welcomes the sight of Fantuz, he will just go out and do his thing. \n“Jeff is a pretty centred guy, emotionally and mentally,” Austin said. “He understands the role he is in. He understands his play is completely dependent upon the quality of the play of the guys around him. He gets that. He is going to keep doing his job and try to help his teammates win football games and continue to be well-prepared.” \nBIG SHOES TO FILL \nIn replacing Zach Collaros under centre, Jeff Mathews is under no illusion. \nMathews knows he has big shoes to fill for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, and he got on track with a strong performance last week against Saskatchewan. \nIn trying to keep the Ticats’ Grey Cup hopes alive for the next six weeks, it’s as much about getting the little things right as it is making big plays. \n“It’s not easy,” Mathews said. “Zach is one heck of a player and he proved to be the MOP through (12) games. It’s a big adjustment (for receivers), the way you call a play in the huddle, and I am trying to make sure it is seamless for those guys. \n“They had to make a huge transition and they have done a great job ... there is always chemistry to be built. Each week it’s a new challenge. You have new tendencies that players and teams do in certain coverages that you are trying to get that to teammates, to receivers especially and to understand when we run (a certain) route it is going to be a little different than last week. It’s like fine-tuning.” \nterry.koshan@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:46:32.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
