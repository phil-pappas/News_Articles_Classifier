Robert Darnell, who has worked for four years as a corrections officer at the Central New Mexico Correctional Facility in Los Lunas. “How are you supposed to watch over these (inmates) if you can’t stay awake?”\nIn some cases, officers say they face 16-hour work days and up to 72-hour workweeks.\nTop-ranking Corrections Department officials said no specific incidents have been pinpointed to staffing levels, but acknowledge high vacancy rates due largely to trouble recruiting and retaining employees at low pay rates are a long running problem spot.\nAs of this summer, five of the state’s six state-run prisons had vacancy rates of 20 percent or higher – the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility outside Las Cruces is the only one that did not – and starting corrections officer pay is just $13.65 an hour in most cases.\nThe Western New Mexico Correctional Facility in Grants and the Springer Correctional Center both had vacancy rates of more than 40 percent.\n“You can only ask someone to work overtime for so long,” Deputy Corrections Secretary Mark Myers told the Journal . “We can’t keep running our officers into the ground.”\nWhile some corrections officers volunteer to work extra hours, Myers said overtime has been made mandatory in some cases for corrections officers, due to the need to keep certain posts staffed around the clock in state-run prisons.\n“We can’t shut down a prison and go home – we’re the keepers of the keys,” Myers said.\nThe agency has contracted with an outside firm to do a staffing study – it’s expected to be finished in a month or so – on how to best deploy guards, but he said low pay levels for corrections officers has prompted many officers to leave for jobs with other law enforcement agencies and left the agency shorthanded.\nHe also said New Mexico salary levels for corrections officers are, even after 2014 pay raises, still among the nation’s lowest, while adding that additional raises are a top priority for the department for the 2016 legislative session.\nThough it’s unclear how much “new” money lawmakers will have to divvy up for the coming year, top budget officials in Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration have also signaled that targeted pay raises will be a priority.\nFinance and Administration Secretary Tom Clifford told a legislative committee in August that low salaries were causing workforce woes at the state Corrections Department, in addition to several other agencies.\n“We’re having significant turnover and overtime issues in those departments,” Clifford said.\nMessy history\nNew Mexico’s history with prison staffing issues is a messy one.\nAn attorney general’s report on the 1980 prison riot at the old penitentiary outside Santa Fe – one of the deadliest in the nation’s history – noted the prison had a correction officer turnover rate of 76 percent in the year before the riot. In addition, nearly 60 percent of the guards on duty at the time of the riot had been working there for less than three years.\nSanta Fe attorney Mark Donatelli, who has been involved in state prison issues for decades, said high correction officer vacancy rates raise concern, specifically vacancy rates of 40 percent or higher.\nLow officer staffing levels and high turnover can negatively affect a prison, in part by increasing tension between guards and inmates and, in some cases, making it more difficult for prisons to offer rehabilitation programs – including vocational programs – for inmates, he said.\n“It creates a culture that sometimes increases tension,” Donatelli said. “Either you’re burning out your staff, or some needs, important needs, are going unmet.”\nIn addition to vacancy rates, Donatelli said other key factors to monitor are inmate numbers per prison and the breakdown of prison staff assignments by prison security levels.\nAs of this week, there were 7,320 incarcerated inmates in New Mexico prisons, though that figure includes both the six state-run prisons and the five privately run prisons. Private prisons have stipulated staffing levels in their contracts they must adhere to, and the Corrections Department can – and has – levied fines for failing to comply.\nMeanwhile, Donatelli also said he believes the lessons of the 1980 prison riot are still fresh in the minds of most legislators and state corrections administrators, saying, “They haven’t forgotten that overcrowding and a lack of staffing is a dangerous combination.”\nDeputy Corrections Secretary Myers said the high vacancy rates have not had a negative impact on inmate programs, but acknowledged that starting any new programs would likely take additional resources.\n“It makes it hard for us to do what we need to do to meet our goals,” Myers said. “It’s hard to establish those goals if we have an unstable workforce.”\n“We’re doing everything we can to avoid a situation where someone gets hurt,” Myers added.\nReality show\nOne bright spot could be the A&E television show “Behind Bars: Rookie Year,” which followed a group of new corrections officers working at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, located outside Santa Fe.\nA recent academy class for corrections officers in training included 41 cadets, a larger number than usual, and a number of them indicated that the reality TV show – its first season just finished airing – sparked interest in the possible career path, Myers said.\nThe Corrections Department has also begun offering satellite training classes for would-be corrections officers, in hopes of attracting new recruits.\nHowever, the difficulty keeping new corrections officers on board has led to some officers having to work 15- to 16-hour workdays, a Corrections Department spokeswoman said.\n“We’re in agreement the officers should not be working those long hours,” agency spokeswoman Alex Tomlin said. “We appreciate the officers and what they do.”\nCentral New Mexico Correctional Facility officer Darnell, an active union member, said that while some corrections officers are racking up the overtime pay, they are paying the price in other areas.\n“With the hours we’re seeing, the stress is through the roof,” Darnell said in a recent interview. “What we’re creating, it’s almost like the perfect storm.”\nHe lauded Corrections Secretary Gregg Marcantel and other top-ranking agency officials for pushing for pay raises, but said more needs to be done.\nTo draw attention to the situation, Darnell and other union-affiliated officers at the Los Lunas prison held a picket in August to protest the high vacancy rates, workweeks of up to 72 hours and the negative side effects they say are caused as a result. They also launched an online petition urging the Governor’s Office and state lawmakers to address the situation.\n“We want the public to know the facilities are not safe,” Darnell said.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a00_jd_04oct_prisonbox-640x162.png"], "published": "2015-10-04T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:06:13.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
