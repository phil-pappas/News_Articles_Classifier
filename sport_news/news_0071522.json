But the bad part is that we don’t compete for two weeks.” \nThe Trojans’ Alyssa Slobodiak (22:08) finished first as she had a season-best time to lead the Green Sea Floyds girls, which had eight runners finish in the top 10. Meanwhile, Madison Pope (Third, 23:39), Abby Marlowe (Fourth, 23:40) and Katya Howell (24:07) were each named to the All-Region team, representing the Trojans. \nOn the boys’ side, Alfredo Vasquez (18:48) paced Green Sea Floyds with a first place finish, while Bryce Ford (second, 19:01), Steele Willoughby (third, 19:21) and Dawson Floyd (fifth, 20:26) were named All-Region runners. \n“I’m really proud our boys and girls were champs,” Elvington said. “Eight in the top 10 on the girls side and seven in the top 10 for the boys; not bad. I was pleased with how we placed in the region.” \nMeanwhile, Elvington said the Trojans will have to just go even harder during practice with the extended time off. \n“It’s kind of disheartening because we’re peaking; we had our top 11 boys finish with personal best times and the girls have been doing really well, too,” Elvington said. “We just have to run and practice real hard from now until then.” \nThe Green Sea Floyds girls are 25-11 overall this year, while the boys stand at 20-17. Elvington wants to see a strong showing in Columbia. \n“We need to focus,” she said. “We want to finish well and have some all-state runners.” \nGirls \nTeam scores: Green Sea Floyds 23, Carvers Bay 45, Latta inc. \nTop 10: 1.
