Crowley said she threw Manziel's wallet out of the window. \nThe report stated the couple then stopped the car in an Avon neighborhood and continued arguing. That's when a second witness called police. \nMinutes later, police stopped Manziel's car on Nagle Road where he said both he and Crowley had been drinking in downtown Cleveland earlier that day. \nIn the report, Crowley told police Manziel pushed her head into a window. She wanted her cell phone because she was concerned about her safety and said she just wanted to return to Texas. \nThe report stated police did see an abrasion on Crowley's arm but later determined that the abrasion was from Manziel's attempt to keep her from getting out of the vehicle while it was on the road. \nAccording to the report, police did not believe the couple was intoxicated to the point where they could be charged and Crowley told officers that she did not want to press charges so both were allowed to leave the scene in Manziel's car. \nThe Browns released a statement claiming they were aware of the incident: \nWe were aware of the situation. It is a matter that we take seriously and have expressed our concerns to Johnny directly. Those conversations will remain private and we will refrain from further comment at this time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:01:54.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
