The Bluegrass Poll will be out on Wednesday, and maybe that will give us a bit more clarity.\nEven Bevin’s campaign leaked a poll recently that showed Conway ahead by three percentage points -- although Republicans believe if they are correctly predicting who will go to the polls, that Bevin will eke out a narrow win.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nJack Conway fights 'wonkish' ways in gov. bid\nIt’s because of that -- and maybe concern about down-ticket races -- that the Republican Governors Association has come in at the last minute and bought $1.6 million in ads over the last two weeks of the campaign.\nFrustrated that Bevin wasn’t raising money and had spent relatively little of his own on the election, the governors association had only weeks earlier pulled out after having spotted Bevin a cool $3 million in ads.\nConway’s folks, on the other hand, believe they are on track to win.\nPolls have consistently shown that the attorney general has a lead in the race and although that lead remains stubborn at around five percentage points, his internals are starting to see some of the down-ticket Democrats establish bulges a bit bigger than they have been in previous polls.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nDrew Curtis takes on major party candidates\nThey are convinced that the months of attacks on Bevin -- for being late in paying his taxes and for taking conflicting positions on everything from the Medicaid expansion to early childhood education to his support or non-support of public-private partnerships to build roads -- are taking their toll.\nBevin, they say, is nearly “upside down” in his favorable and unfavorable ratings, which is a key measure of a candidate’s electability.\nBevin now has an ad up starring his wife, Glenna, in which she decries the Democratic ads, calling them “misleading” and “false.”\nMany of the ads about Bevin’s tax delinquencies are, in fact, misleading. Late taxes on his vacation home in Maine were because the tax bill went to the wrong mortgage company. Tax delinquencies on his Connecticut bell manufacturing company were accrued before he took over as president.\nBut the ads that show him flip-flopping on various issues are true. That’s actually Bevin in those ads -- saying one thing, then denying he ever said it.\nThe only attack Republicans have mounted on Conway link him to President Barack Obama. The most recent ad has a woman saying of Conway, “Just like Obama, maybe worse than Obama.” The ad doesn’t say about what she is talking.\nDemocrats are hopeful with Obama’s second term winding down that the line of attack, which has served the Kentucky GOP well for the past six years, is growing weary with voters.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nMatt Bevin loses his TV-funding super PAC\nAt the same time they’re concerned that Bevin, who is a strong retail campaigner, has made inroads around the state over the last two years -- talking to voters while Conway has spent the vast majority of his time raising money for the air war.\nAbout the only thing we know for certain is that Drew Curtis, the independent candidate who breathed some life and humor into this election, is not going to win. He’s not raised significant money and has aired no television ads. His spokeswoman has even been on Facebook talking about job interviews so she’ll have employment after the election.\nIt’s probably a smart move for her to lock up a job now because if Bevin can pull out the win, the job market will be much tougher on Nov. 4, with all the Democrats looking for work.\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
