Especially with a player like Beckham, who is one of the fastest receivers in the NFL, a hamstring injury could seriously impact his ability on Monday night.\nNow that he is expected to be out on the field, however, the question is -- how will the Eagles stop him?\nThe Eagles didn't have much luck last season containing Beckham. The last time the two teams met, Beckham caught 12 passes for 185 yards and a touchdown, but that was against an Eagles' secondary that has since been torn apart and rebuilt.\nHead coach Chip Kelly spent big money on cornerback Byron Maxwell , and also brought in cornerback Walter Thurmond, who has since turned into a stellar safety. The team also promoted Nolan Carroll to starting cornerback.\nWHO WILL WIN: Eagles or Giants? Against the Giants on Monday night, it will be interesting to see how defensive coordinator Billy Davis deploys his new secondary against Beckham.\nSpeaking earlier in the week, Maxwell revealed that the team doesn't plan on having how shadow Beckham. While there could be some gamesmanship at work, with Maxwell unlikely to reveal the team's plan, that isn't surprising. Davis and secondary coach Cory Undlin have yet to have a cornerback shadow a receiver throughout the game so far this season, and Davis didn't do it last year either.\nPart of the problem with having a player shadow Beckham is how much the Giants move him around. Beckham lines up both on the outside and in the slot, and sometimes even lines up in the back field. Although Maxwell does have some experience in slot coverage, asking him to chase Beckham around all night might be too much to ask of any cornerback.\nAssuming the Eagles don't shadow Beckham, Davis' decision will be whether or not to give his cornerbacks help over the top.\nLast year, Davis left his cornerbacks in man coverage against Beckham, and the results were ugly. Davis has shown this season he isn't afraid to leave his cornerbacks out on an island, as he did it time-and-time against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 1, a game where wide receiver Julio Jones torched the Eagles' secondary.\nMore than likely, Davis is going to trust whatever cornerback lines up across from Beckham to cover him.\nIf Davis learned a lesson from last year, and from earlier this season, he will give that cornerback safety help over the top, not asking one player to stop Beckham on his own.\nA task no cornerback has shown he is able to do -- even if Beckham might not be 100%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:09:46.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
