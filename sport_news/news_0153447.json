Comment   Nicholas Cicale Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 2:11 PM By Nicholas Cicale Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 2:11 PM In what felt like a close game for much of the first half, St. James Area lost to Luverne 42-7 Friday night. During the pregame, SJA celebrated senior night, and took the field wearing pink accessories for breast cancer awareness. The Cardinals scored on their opening drive, with Nick Overgaard catching his first of many long receptions. After a fumble, Jaxon Nelson ran the ball in from 37-yards out, giving them a 14-0 lead. Chris Johnson helped SJA shake off their slow start, by recovering a fumble. Johnson also emerged as a receiving threat on offense. After a smooth one-handed grab on the first drive, he drew a pass interference call two drives later. The penalty set up a first down, and Brady Stevens connected with Max Svalland on a wheel route in traffic. Svalland took the pass 43 yards and into the red zone, Then Brady Halvorson bounced a run outside for a Saints score. Overgaard caught a long pass to start Luverne’s next drive, and was tackled by Tylar Larson to save a score, at least momentarily. Luverne added a touchdown a few plays later. Down 21-7, Halvorson had a good kickoff return, and Svalland ran for a first down. After a few quarterback scrambles for plus yardage, Stevens was replaced momentarily by Sandin Skow, who hit Halvorson in traffic to extend the drive. The Saints attempted a field goal, which would have made it a two-possession game, but couldn’t get the ball through the uprights. Nelson scored a second rushing touchdown, and Overgaard scored in the last five minutes of the first half. Decian Beers scored the final touchdown of the contest in the third quarter, as the SJA defense was able to give Luverne some resistance up front down the stretch. Kevin Arkaputra produced the highlight of the fourth quarter with a big tackle behind the line of scrimmage. SJA will play their homecoming game Friday evening against the Windom Eagles. Windom is also currently 1-5, with their lone victory coming against Lester Prairie back on August 22.
