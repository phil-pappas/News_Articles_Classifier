In the end, No. 8 Oklahoma tripped No. 2 Kansas State 41-31 in Bob Stoops’ first appearance in Manhattan as the Sooners coach. Stoops had previously served on Bill Snyder’s original staff, where he rose to co-defensive coordinator before leaving in 1995. \nThe Wildcats rolled off 17 unanswered points during a 10-minute stretch of the second half, but pulled no closer than seven after the Sooners built a 38-14 margin midway through the third quarter. \nA blocked punt Terence Newman returned 16 yards capped K-State’s comeback bid with 10:31 remaining after Quincy Morgan had scored on a 69-yard touchdown pass from Jonathan Beasley barely two minutes earlier. \nOklahoma, which eventually went unbeaten and claimed the national title, stiffened the rest of the way. Quarterback Josh Heupel completed 29 of 37 passes for 374 yards. He accounted for three touchdowns. \n“We knew they had the capabilities and that’s something we prepared for,’’ K-State linebacker Ben Leber said. “We tried to stop them, but they came out and exploded.’’ \nBeasley managed 211 yards passing for K-State, going just 14 of 36 with two interceptions. The Cats’ David Allen led all rushers with 60 yards on nine carries. \n“Hopefully, we know we haven't played our best games, but I think (the win) will turn some eyes,’’ OU linebacker Rocky Calmus said. “You know, they are the No. 2 team in the nation and we beat them out. The next step is No. 1 (Nebraska) and we have that in two weeks.’’ \nThe loss snapped the Wildcats’ 25-game home win streak and a five-game win streak against OU. \nIt also marked the first meeting between the programs since three former K-State assistants – Mike Stoops, Brent Venables and Mark Mangino – left after the 1998 season to join the OU staff Bob Stoops originally assembled. \nBIG 12 TACKLING DRILL \nHOT SHOT \nOklahoma State DE Emmanuel Ogbah \nThe 6-4, 275-pound junior surprised many when he came back this season. Big 12 rivals want to advise Ogbah he can make good coin playing football elsewhere. In league play, Ogbah is tops in sacks, tackles for loss and fumbles forced. He scored a touchdown last week to help in an OT win at West Virginia. \nCOLD (WELL, SOFT) SPOT \nTexas retires ailing Bevo \nBevo XIV was unable to attend the upset Texas handed Oklahoma last week and has since retired after being diagnosed with Bovine Leukemia Virus. The latest in the line of iconic steers followed the Longhorns since 2004, attending 107 wins and the second inauguration of President George W. Bush. \nMUST-SEE GAMES \nWest Virginia (3-2, 0-2) at No. 2 Baylor (5-0, 2-0) \n11 a.m. Saturday, Fox \nHeat is on Dana Holgorsen following two defeats to begin league play. A soft nonconference schedule hurt the Mountaineers, as did a season-ending injury to S Karl Joseph. The Bears are keeping their best players “fresh’’ and could substitute by the masses again, though WVU leads the nation with 13 picks. \nNo. 19 Oklahoma (4-1, 1-1) at Kansas State (3-2, 0-2) \n2:30 p.m. Saturday, ABC \nNetworks execs were fooled, like everyone, into thinking OU would be undefeated. Bob Stoops is 16-1 in the game after playing Texas. The lone defeat happened last year against K-State. Stoops is 6-0 after losing to the Longhorns. The Cats have issues, but also 11 TDs in 11 red-zone trips the past two games. \nNo. 3 TCU (6-0, 3-0) at Iowa State (2-3, 1-1) \n6 p.m. Saturday, ESPN2 \nThe best player you don’t know in the Big 12? It could be RB Mike Warren of Iowa State. He rushed for 245 yards last week, the most by an FBS freshman this season. He’ll try to keep the TCU offense on the sideline, but with Trevone Boykin, Todd Doctson and Aaron Green, the Frogs can score in a heartbeat. \nNATIONAL TACKLING DRILL \nHOT SHOT \nIowa RB Jordan Canzeri \nBig Ten teams still love to pound the pig and undefeated Iowa is no exception. Canzeri rushed 43 times for 256 yards in a win last week over Illinois. His 75-yard touchdown burst provided a 10-point margin. Canzeri then rushed on 11 consecutive plays to position the Hawkeyes for a fourth-quarter field goal. \nCOLD SPOT \nSteve Spurrier’s resignation \nThe departure of Steve Spurrier as South Carolina coach halfway through the season was disappointing. The successful coach revolutionized the SEC with his “Fun ‘n Gun’’ approach and also the snappy jabs that always provided good bites and copy. Still, Spurrier quit on his team after starting 0-4 league start. \nMUST-SEES \nNo. 10 Alabama (5-1, 2-1) at No. 9 Texas A&M (5-0, 2-0) \n2:30 p.m. Saturday, CBS \nBy going 25 of 41 for 322 yards passing against Mississippi State, QB Kyle Allen delivered A&M its first home win under Kevin Sumlin against a ranked foe. Coming off a bye, the Aggies welcome Bama. A&M stumbled to an 8-5 finish following a 5-0 start last year. Bama has not lost two SEC games since 2010. \nNo. 7 Michigan State (6-0, 2-0) at No. 12 Michigan (5-1, 2-0) \n2:30 p.m. Saturday, ESPN \nMichigan became the first FBS team to shut out three consecutive opponents since Kansas State in 1995, when the Wildcats led the nation in total defense. Some hire, this Jim Harbaugh character. Injuries limit the Spartans, though they remain unbeaten. They have won six of the last seven against the Wolverines. \nNo. 8 Florida (6-0, 4-0) at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0) \n6 p.m. Saturday, ESPN \nWith QB Will Grier suspended for the season after failing a drug test, the Gators turn to Treon Harris, a better runner. LSU counters with Brandon Harris at QB. He set personal bests with 18 completions, 28 attempts and 228 yards last week against South Carolina. RB Leonard Fournette remains the Tigers star. \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:04:12.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
