Email him at jon_wertheim@yahoo.com or tweet him @jon_wertheim .\nThis week’s Mailbag, while marveling at Ash Barty and her “ seamless transition from tennis to cricketer ….”\nHi Jon, I'm sure you've received plenty of mail about Genie Bouchard's decision to take legal action against the USTA after her locker room concussion. I am wondering what you think of this development.\nI certainly cannot deny or confirm negligence on the part of the USTA, but it seems to me that Genie's decision to take to the courtroom is a bad signal for fans hoping to see her gain momentum on the tennis court. Further the indication that this could cost the USTA \"millions and millions\" feels like an indication that a player once touted to be the next Sharapova in terms of marketability has resorted to playing blame games instead of restoring the state of her currently struggling tennis brand.\n— Brennan Mange, Durham, N.C.\nTennis Video Eugenie Bouchard suing USTA over locker room fall at U.S. Open by SI Wire", "external_links": ["http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/ash-barty-made-seamless-transition-from-tennis-to-cricketer-says-brisbane-heat-coach/story-fnii0bxd-1227573566093", "http://twitter.com/jon_wertheim", "https://twitter.com/jon_wertheim"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:16:46.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
