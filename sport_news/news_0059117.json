(AP Photo/John Bazemore) more > By PAUL NEWBERRY - Associated Press - Wednesday, October 21, 2015 \nATLANTA (AP) - Coach Mike Budenholzer is still reluctant to provide an answer to the lone question mark in the Atlanta Hawks lineup. \nFrom all indications, though, Kent Bazemore will be the starting small forward when the regular season begins next week. \nThe 6-foot-5 swingman has started all five preseason games he’s played in, making it clear he’s the choice to fill the vacancy created when DeMarre Carroll signed a free-agent deal with Toronto. Bazemore had his best game yet Wednesday night, leading the Hawks with 18 points in an 82-81 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. \nThabo Sefolosha was the other main contender for the spot, but he’s still working his way into playing shape after recovering from a broken leg. \nNow, all that’s left is for Budenholzer to make it official. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:31:09.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
