Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 9:54 am Vaqueras get 3-0 win over Arizona Western By ED PETRUSKA, Staff Writer Casa Grande Valley Newspapers Inc. SIGNAL PEAK — The Central Arizona College volleyball team totally controlled Wednesday night’s match against Arizona Western, so much so that the Vaqueras did not have to use a timeout. Central snapped a two-match losing streak and stayed in postseason contention with a 3-0 victory at the George Young Activity Center. Game scores were 25-19, 25-15, 25-21. “Throughout the season, we’ve talked about giving a consistent effort and executing the game plan to the last whistle,” CAC coach Mike Owens said. “That’s what we did tonight. “It’s a great night when you can’t single out an individual player. It was a real team effort. Everyone contributed and everyone was engaged.” Shelby Apodaca delivered 14 of the Vaqueras’ 36 kills and also served five aces. The aces came in succession — three to close out Game 2 and two on her first service opportunity in Game 3. Savannah Ekis had eight kills, followed by Jael Jundt with five, Karson Bisharat with four, Janet Sauter with three and Bailey Crenshaw with two. The Vaqueras raised their overall record to 9-8. They are 5-5 in the Arizona Community College Athletic Conference, two games ahead of Western (10-8, 3-7). Central was tied with Eastern for second among the ACCAC’s four Division I teams going in. The top two teams (Yavapai was 6-1 in conference play prior to Wednesday’s matches) will play for the Region 1 championship. “The pressure was on us not so much for a victory, but to play well and execute,” Owens said. “The girls focused on the process, and the win came with that process.” There were six ties and three lead changes in Game 1. Central led 13-10 before the Matadors tied it for the final time at 13-13. Apodaca had three kills during a 5-1 run that put the Vaqueras ahead to stay at 18-14, and game point came on a tip kill by Crenshaw. Western led once in Game 2, going up 2-1 before CAC scored three straight points and six of the next seven. That run featured two kills by Apodaca and one by Bisharat. Wiebke Zink’s ace gave the Vaqueras a 12-8 advantage, and back-to-back kills by Apodaca extended the lead to 18-12. CAC closed the game with a 7-2 surge. Game 3 had three ties and three lead changes. Central went ahead to stay at 7-6 on Apodaca’s ace, and the Vaqueras took a 14-10 lead on Bisharat’s ace. After Paola Figueroa’s kill pulled Western within 21-19, CAC got a block from Sauter to make it 22-19 and a kill by Ekis for match point. Figueroa had 13 kills for the Matadors, who finished with 34. Deja Lester had eight kills, and Karen Asprilla had six.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:18:00.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
