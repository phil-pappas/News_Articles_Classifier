(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) more > By PETE IACOBELLI -   \nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) - No. 6 Clemson began preparing for life after Notre Dame well before beating the Fighting Irish this past weekend. \nTigers co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said coach Dabo Swinney made sure for the two weeks leading up to Saturday night’s thrilling 24-22 victory the players knew there was much more season to go. \n“He was telling them, ‘Hey, this is going to be a big moment. But it’s only a moment,’” Scott recalled Monday. “At the end of the day, we’re going to be 4-0 or 3-1 and it’s not going to mean a lot as far as the whole season.” \nThe season continues Saturday when the Tigers (4-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) take on Georgia Tech (2-3, 0-2). \nClemson hopes for a championship season will depend on its ability to leave the past behind and focus on the next game. \n“We have a goal and dreams that are set in front of us,” said quarterback Deshaun Watson. \nScott said coaches will remind younger players how Clemson opened 2011 at 8-0 and rose to No. 8 nationally before losing three of their next four games. \n“This doesn’t mean a lot if we don’t take care of business,” he said. \nThe Tigers stayed perfect and moved into the top 10 by holding off No. 15 Notre Dame’s late rally in the instant classic played in a soaking rainstorm. \nClemson carried a 21-3 lead into the fourth quarter before the Irish rallied with 19 points and 225 yards in the final period. The game came down to a two-point conversion with Clemson defensive tackle Carlos Watkins stuffing quarterback DeShone Kizer short of the goal line with 7 seconds left. \nThe sold-out crowd, most covered in orange ponchos and rain suits, roared when time ticked down, many rushing the soggy field to celebrate with the players. \nAs Kizer and Watson left the field, the friends shared a few words. \n“This is one of those games in the future we’re telling our kids about,” Watson said Kizer told him. \nBut that’s the past and the future, the Tigers need to remain in the present. \nClemson showed off many strong attributes its hopes it can carry into the game against the Yellow Jackets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:03:15.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
