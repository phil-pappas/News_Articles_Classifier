United beat New York City 2-1 on a rainy Friday night to secure an Eastern Conference playoff spot. \nFrank Lampard opened the scoring in the first minute for the fastest goal in City’s opening season. Bill Hamid blocked David Villa’s attempt and Lampard slotted the rebound for his third goal in his last four games. \nFabian Espindola equalized in the 73rd minute. Josh Saunders dove to get a hand on Chris Pontius’ shot and Espindola put in the rebound. \nVilla sent a ball just over the crossbar in the 41st and rolled one wide of the near post in first-half stoppage time. \nD.C. United ended its six-game winless stretch to move into a share of first place with the New York Red Bulls. City had its three-game winning streak stopped. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:27:04.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
