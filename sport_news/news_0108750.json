Cardinals thrilled to return home after four weeks on road 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nIt's been four weeks since Lamar last played a home game, so it's understandable if they are a bit homesick. \nBut the queasiness they expected to subside, remains present.A heartbreaking defeat like they suffered a week ago at Southeastern Louisiana will do that to you. \nThe Cardinals (2-2, 1-1 Southland) were a fourth down stop away from beating their second-straight ranked Southland opponent on the road and enter the Abilene Christian game anxious to get back in the win column. \n\"We definitely have a chip on our shoulder,\" Cardinals senior quarterback Joe Minden said. \"We were so close to coming back here 2-0 in conference and we're not so that kind of hurts.\" \nToday's 7 p.m. game against the Wildcats (3-2, 1-1) at Provost Umphrey Stadium is the Cardinal's first home game since their home opener against Bacone College , a span of 35 days. \nExpectations have soared since the 66-3 victory over the Warriors with the upset victory over then-No. 3 Sam Houston State and close loss to then-No. 22 Southeastern Louisiana. \nNow, the Cardinals face a Wildcats' team Lamar head coach Ray Woodard is wary of. \n\"(Abilene Christian) is just a good, solid football team,\" Woodard said. \"If you look at them, they already looked like a Southland team at the beginning of the season.\" \nThe Wildcats sputtered last Saturday against Central Arkansas 42-14 in their first road conference game of the season, however. \nThe Bears jumped out to a 32-0 lead at one point in the second quarter and if Lamar can duplicate that success, will be in good shape. \n\"I'd love it if we were able to start like that,\" Woodard said. \"But I don't think that will happen to them again.\" \nWoodard doesn't expect Abilene Christian to come out flat again and Wildcats' head coach Ken Collums is hoping for a performance more like their 35-32 victory over Stephen F. Austin two weeks ago. \n\"That was the first time a team got out on us and we couldn't do anything about it,\" Collums said. \"(Central Arkansas) came out and took it to us.\" \nCollums knows the Cardinals' chip on their shoulder won't be the only thing they have going for them. \n\"If you face a team that's healthy and in a groove, you have to play great to beat them,\" Collums said. \"It doesn't take a long time to look at (Lamar) and realize they are a good team.\" \nWoodard doesn't expect a letdown after two emotional conference games. \nInstead, he expects the Cardinals to come out and live up to the expectations that have been placed on his team because of those games. \n\"This is like our home opener,\" Woodard said. \"We had an opportunity to start out 2-0 so that kind of set us back a little bit. We have to keep moving and keep getting better and hopefully this game will do that for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:53:16.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
