(AP Photo/Darko Bandic) more > By - Associated Press   \nZAGREB, Croatia (AP) - Ideye Brown scored a late winner to earn Olympiakos a 1-0 victory over Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday. \nThe Nigerian made the most of a cross from Dimitris Siovas, racing down the left with no support before surging past two defenders and goalkeeper Eduardo to score in the 79th minute. It secured a second consecutive away win for Olympiakos in Group F after beating Arsenal last time. \nThe 27-year-old Brown’s classy finish atoned for squandering an earlier chance, missing an open goal after sliding to meet a cross from Felipe Pardo. \n“I tried to run fast when I saw Pardo. I went for the ball … Then I managed to score a more difficult goal. That’s football,” Brown said. \n“We knew we had to score. Now we’re level with Bayern and we want to make it to the next round.” \nZagreb fought hard for an early goal and could have taken the lead in the 10th minute but Armin Hodzic was too slow to react in front of the goal after Marko Rog skipped past two defenders to set up the chance. \nThe hosts spent most of the match defending, although Domagoj Antolic and Rog both hit the post in the second half. \nThe Greek champions played without any of their fans at a half-full Maksimir Stadium over fears of crowd trouble. \nZagreb coach Zoran Mamic said experience and not skill determined the game. \n“We had more chances, but they scored,” Mamic said. \n“It’s not always best team that wins. The difference today was between players who have more experience and players who have less experience … We still want to be the surprise of this group.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:12:23.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
