Last season, DiLeo suffered a needless injury in the postseason. To say that Nick DiLeo felt the highs and lows of playoff baseball last season would be an understatement.\nXavier's then-sophomore pitched a one-hit shutout against St. Raymond to punch the Knights' ticket to the CHSAA Class A Intersectional championship.\nThe Knights, seeded eighth, scored an extra-innings victory over St. Joseph by-the-Sea just three days later, but DiLeo slammed his bat after his final plate appearance and inadvertently injured his wrist.\nHe had to miss his scheduled start for the next day's double-elimination tournament, and the Vikings wound up defeating Xavier to clinch the league title.\nAs painful as the experience was, it taught DiLeo a valuable lesson: The Knights need him to be calm, cool and in charge during big situations.\nThat holds true for this season, one in which DiLeo has been tabbed as the Knights' ace, replacing graduated Robbie Maguire .\n\"It's the best thing in the world,\" the junior said of being the top arm in the rotation. \"You know the whole team is counting on you. . . . Last year, I was on the mound a lot more, and that got my pitching confidence up. This year, I'm looking to take off.\"\nAdded Xavier coach Rich Duffell: \"He's my No. 1. He's very important to us.\"\nThe junior southpaw went six innings, striking out six and allowing five hits in the Knights' 6-2 season-opening victory over Fordham Prep in the Bronx on a rainy Wednesday.\nJames McCool , who was the emergency starter in last year's final, picked up the save after DiLeo set the tone.\n\"Locating the fastball, getting ahead in the count - that was everything,\" DiLeo said afterward. \"Getting behind in the count is ... no fun.\"\nOr, for that matter, falling behind, period. Xavier's run to the finals as an eighth seed out of the losers bracket last season was surely memorable, but with a host of key players returning, the Knights see no reason why they can't be one of the league's dominant teams from start to finish.\n\"Last year was a great year, but we fell short,\" DiLeo said. \"This year, we expect to be back and we want to win it all. Second place is not good anymore, not that it ever was.\n\"It doesn't matter that last year I was a sophomore, this year I'm a junior,\" he added. \"I have to pitch against the best teams, and we have to beat the best teams to take it all.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:20:17.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
