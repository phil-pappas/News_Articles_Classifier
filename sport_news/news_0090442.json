Datisa had its accounts frozen by the Justice Department as part of the ongoing FIFA investigation.\nThe specter of the investigation and allegations of corruption remain evident, even in the statement released Friday.\n“We are extremely happy for our fans, our teams and our partners, that we were able to find a way to host the Copa America Centenario celebration in the United States under an entirely new structure for managing the tournament’s operations and finances,” the statement read. The improved governance structure will bring greater accountability and transparency to the event so it can serve its two intended purposes – to celebrate the 100 years of history of Copa America, and provide a once in a lifetime spectacle for fans in the CONCACAF and CONMEBOL regions.”\nCONCACAF and CONMEBOL also announced an agreement to form a new executive committee for the event, which will include two members of each group and a member of U.S. Soccer to manage the tournament and finances. The groups hope it will create “greater financial transparency.”\nThe tournament is set for the summer of 2016, and will feature the 10 teams of CONMEBOL and six CONCACAF teams. The United States, Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica already have gained entry, while playoffs between Panama and Cuba, and Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti will determine the final two slots.\nVenues have not yet been selected for the event.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:38:02.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
