By CHRIS CASEY ccasey @shawmedia.com \nAdam Durocher and the St. Charles North football team found out just how important one kick can be. \nNorth had just taken a late lead over Geneva two weekends ago, and Durocher lined up his PAT to give the North Stars a seven-point lead. \nGeneva’s Griffin Bellano blocked the kick and North ended up losing by a point. While it might not have been the junior kicker’s fault that it was blocked, it proved the point that in high school, getting in the end zone doesn’t guarantee seven points. \n“It’s so important to for everyone to do their job on special teams,” Durocher said. “I try to go out and do the same things every time, with my steps and everything, and pay attention to the little details. It’s one kick and it’s over with, but that lost us the game and it shows how important every play can be.” \nDurocher has had kicking in his blood since he can remember. Although his parents never played soccer, all of the Durocher kids have. If that last name sounds familiar, it’s probably due to the fact that Durocher’s sister, Hanna, was the 2015 Kane County Chronicle Girls Soccer Player of the Year last spring and currently plays at NCAA Division II Barry University in Florida. \nTheir younger brother, Billy, is the kicker for the North freshman football team, as well. \nAdam Durocher played soccer up until eighth grade, but once his kicking ability was recognized by North assistant coach Tom Poulin after a game with the sophomore team last year, the varsity job has been his ever since. \nWhile the Friday night lights atmosphere gets most high school players hyped to run out on the field, the mantra of a kicker is much different. While players bang their helmets together or get jacked up celebrating a touchdown, Durocher has learned to like his privacy. \n“I try to stay away from everyone,” Durocher said. “As a kicker, you can’t really get too fired up or have a ton of energy, you know. All of the steps and alignment can change if you’re off by just an inch, so it’s important to keep focus and stay calm.” \nIt may have been hard for Batavia kicker Jack Carlson to keep his cool when the Bulldogs took the field at Oswego in Week 1. Carlson, a freshman, took part in a tryout for the position with the entire Batavia football team during the summer. \nCoach Dennis Piron joked that it came down to wide receiver Canaan Coffey, running back Zach Garrett, Carlson and a few linemen. While Coffey still takes care of the punting duties, Piron saw something in Carlson that gave him confidence in a freshman at the varsity level. \n“He’s got the ability to put the ball anywhere,” Piron said. “He’s got the perfect mindset for a kicker. He’s calm and focused when he gets out there. He has one thing to worry about taking care of and he does it very well.” \nTwice this season, Carlson, who Piron said has missed two extra points has executed an onside kick to perfection. As uncommon as it was, with both coming in key situations, there was something more unusual. \nThe right-footed kicker used his left foot for an onside kick against the North Stars. \n“I just tried it in practice once lefty, and I ended up being pretty good at it,” Carlson said. \nCarlson, also a wide receiver for the freshman team, said varsity wideout Nick Stuttle sits with him before games to calm his nerves. Ever since the Oswego game and first home game, the nerves have dwindled. But the freshman’s confidence gained him more than enough respect from his varsity peers. \n“When you’re able to spot the ball and put it in a place, and you know he’s going to put it in that place, our confidence in him is amazing,” Batavia quarterback Kyle Niemiec said. “What’s even better is the confidence he has in himself. It seems like he’s been up here forever, you know, and it’s crazy to think that he’s just a freshman.” \nThe luxury of having a reliable kickers is one of the more undervalued things in high school football. After St. Charles East’s Nick Candre drilled a 45-yarder in a Week 2 game, Saints coach Bryce Farquhar said, “I don’t see many people around being able to do what he does.” \nBefore suffering a torn labrum in Week 3, Marmion’s Connor Hoeft had built a reputation as one of the top kickers in the region. \nAs it is, coaches have enough stress poring over film and game-planning for teams. Having that reliable kicker is one less concern heading into Friday nights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:18:27.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
