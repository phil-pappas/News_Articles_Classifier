(AP) — Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy expects to return from a hamstring injury and play Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals. \nMcCoy has missed each of the past two weeks after a setback at practice. He is listed as probable. \nThe status for two other top playmakers is unclear. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor and receiver Sammy Watkins are questionable. \nTaylor was limited at practice for a third straight day Friday. The quarterback sprained a knee ligament in Sunday’s 14-13 win over Tennessee. If Taylor is unable to play, EJ Manuel will start in his place. \nWatkins has missed each of the past two games because of a calf injury. \nReceiver Percy Harvin has an injured hip and is questionable.
