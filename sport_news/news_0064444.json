Arumainayagam, or 'Orumai' as he was affectionately called in Kolkata during his stint with Bagan from 1961-68, was playing for Southern Railway in Chennai when Pele came calling 38 years ago.\n\n\"I still remember the date â€” September 22, 1977,\" Arumainayagam, a member of the gold medal-winning Indian team at the 1962 Jakarta Asian Games, told TOI. \"I got a phone call from a member of the Mohun Bagan management who invited me to a meeting with Pele over dinner after the exhibition match.
