I got to training with Manchester City on Monday and they told me a phone call had come in from Walsall. \n\"I rang Jordy straight away and he had nothing but good words to say. He told me it’s a fantastic club, a close-knit club and they play really good football. \n\"Hearing things like that made it even easier to come. I came down on Tuesday morning, met the lads and spoke with Dean and he said I was going to play. I was delighted.” \nWhile pleased to mark his debut with a goal, Evans was more impressed with the performance of Smith’s side at Oakwell. \nHe said: “I thought we played some excellent football – I thought we were outstanding. I got a goal, which is a great start, but it’s great credit to the team. They all work really hard for each other.
