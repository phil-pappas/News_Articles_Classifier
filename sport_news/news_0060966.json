It’s the most important game for us because it’s the next game,” he said. “We’re all excited to get up there and play them.”\nExcitement?\n“We’re excited to play any team in the league,” Amendola said. “Everyone’s good and everybody has a lot of athletes and a lot of good football players, so this is no different.”\nRunning back Dion Lewis has played four games for the Pats, but he already sounds well-versed in the Foxboro mantra.\n“We’re just taking it game by game,” Lewis said. “Whoever’s next on the schedule, that’s who we focus on, so we’re just kind of taking that approach.”\nWhen asked what he knew of the feud with the Colts, and whether there was a different feel in the locker room, Lewis continued to speak coach Bill Belichick ’s language fluently.\n“Like I said, it’s just the next team on the schedule and we want to win every game, so that’s the goal,” he said.\nTough addition\nOne thing Ninkovich would speak to is the challenge the defense will face with Indy’s biggest offseason acquisition, Frank Gore .\n“Great running back who’s had a lot of success in this league,” Ninkovich said.\nAt 32, the Colts weren’t just taking a flyer on Gore when they inked him to a three-year deal this spring. The $12 million contract has $8.5 million in guaranteed money. In five games he has 325 yards on the ground, and has found the end zone three times.\n“He’s a physical running back,” Ninkovich said. “He has a lot of experience, he’s very talented and he’s physical. So he’s definitely a very good running back that’s been doing it for a long time.”\nGore began his career with San Francisco, earning five Pro Bowl trips.\nChung choice\nThe Patriots defense held a strong Dallas rushing attack to 100 yards on the ground in the 30-6 victory. Belichick credited strong safety play, and singled out one defender in particular.\n“We got a lot of support from the safeties in the running game, and Patrick ( Chung ) played very well. He tackled well as he usually does.”\nChung recorded five tackles and two assists, and Belichick continued to laud his tackling and instincts.\n“Patrick is one of the best tacklers on our team, but he has a real good sense of how to fit on those runs, when to shoot the gap, when to stay back and play over the top, that type of thing, and he’s a very good in-line tackler,” he said. …\nNate Solder left Sunday’s game with an arm injury, but assured reporters that he was fine. “There’s nothing wrong with my elbow,” Solder said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:52:30.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
