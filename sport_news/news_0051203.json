After 22 years in the darkness, the Toronto Blue Jays are centre stage in Hogtown. \nFor once, streets from Steeles to Lake Shore are being painted blue — and it has nothing to do with our dreadful Maple Leafs. \nI’ve been going regularly since 1998 — this year alone we saw 40-plus games, and that’s before the playoffs. I understand there are some new people on the bandwagon — and we’re happy to have you — but here are six things you should know now that you’ve joined us. \n1. The Jays have their own sign language: The players love to salute one another after clutch hits and scoring plays. \nFour of my faves: \nTHE SIX — Josh Donaldson pays tribute to the city every time he crosses home plate by pointing three fingers from his left and right hands skyward. It’s also the number on Marcus Stroman’s jersey and a nod to local rapper Drake. \nYOU CAN’T SEE ME — Joey Bats copped wrestler John Cena’s hand wave in front of his face after throwing out a New York Yankees player earlier this year. Munenori Kawasaki has, of course, put his own spin on it. \nSTIRRING THE POT — The boys were culinary artists in another life. After a single, double or triple, they’ll twist their invisible spoon inside what I only image is about to be another delicious win. \nEDWIN’S EDWING — Every time he hits a dinger, Edwin Encarnacion rounds the bases with his right elbow extended. It’s also known as “walking the parrot.” \n2. Don’t get a knockoff jersey: Everyone wants to show their Blue Jays pride, but there’s nothing that looks worse than fake fan gear. You want to show your pride? Go for one of the classic logo caps or one of those newer 6ctober tees . And if you really want to be a super fan, for a cool $9,025 you can bid on Jose Bautista’s game-used jersey from Game 5 of the ALDS. \n3. Know the songs: The players all have walk-up songs. Get to know ’em. Marcus Stroman struts out to Drake’s Miss Me , Troy Tulowitzki steps into the batter’s box to Aloe Blacc’s The Man and catcher Russell Martin uses Marvin Gaye’s Got to Give it Up. There’s also Take Me Out to the Ballgame (you have to sing it) and OK Blue Jays (that too) during the seventh-inning stretch, and now in the eighth, Blue Swede’s Hooked on a Feeling. \n4. Fan etiquette: Downing a few beers is OK. Hurling them from the 500s onto unsuspecting fans below because of a perceived slight is not. This isn’t a soccer game. Cheer, chant, but don’t abuse your fellow neighbours because of a blown umpiring call. Just because an ump disrespects the game doesn't mean our city will disrespect itself. Be cool, Toronto. #ComeTogether — John Tory (@JohnTory) October 14, 2015 \n5. We want two more ‘bush parties’: Remember, it’s not going to be a celebration when we beat the Kansas City Royals, it’s going to be a “bush party.” So say that often in the lunchroom at work. \n6. Be prepared for heartbreak: Now that we’ve tasted a smidgen of victory, glory seems like it’s right around the corner. But as you get buckled in and this roller-coaster makes its way up, try and remember win or lose: It’s the ride that counts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:07:08.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
