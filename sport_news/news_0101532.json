We played our hearts out with guys like Tommy Trupo and Trevor Starcher playing their hearts out and a guy like Chris Sanchez coming off the bench and playing well.\" \"We were hoping for three points. One point right now, at least it keeps us in the ball game here for a Conference USA Championships bid. We have to get a big win next weekend against UAB at home.\" #BEHERD Stay up to date with Marshall men's soccer and receive the latest news, stats and photos.
