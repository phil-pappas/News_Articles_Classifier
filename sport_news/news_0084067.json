After gashing Miami for 166 yards on Oct. 4, he rushed for 146 yards and one touchdown on 20 carries Sunday. Give credit to another great effort by the offensive line, but Ivory also should be commended for making quick and decisive cuts to wherever the hole might be. QB Ryan Fitzpatrick contributed an 18-yard TD on a scramble.\nPass offense: B+ \nFitzpatrick compiled his highest passer rating of the season (113.1) despite throwing one interception. He threw for 253 yards and two TDs, both in the second half. WRs Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker each lost a fumble in the first half, leading to a pair of Washington field goals. But both caught second-half TD passes. Decker also atoned with a 35-yard catch to set up a touchdown, and Marshall made an outstanding adjustment to catch an underthrown ball from Fitzpatrick, turning it into a 35-yard score.\nRun defense: A+ \nThe Jets completely shut down the Washington running game, limiting the Redskins to 34 yards on 17 carries, with a long gain of a paltry 8 yards. FS Marcus Gilchrist and ILB David Harris stuffed Redskins RB Chris Thompson for a 1-yard loss on third-and-goal from the 1 in the fourth quarter, keying a successful goal-line stand.\nPass defense: A \nStar CB Darrelle Revis allowed an easy 2-yard TD catch to Pierre Garcon in the first quarter, but that was the only major blemish in this area. Revis made up for that mistake with a momentum-turning interception of Kirk Cousins in the third quarter, setting up the go-ahead touchdown. Gilchrist also picked off Cousins, whose longest completion was 20 yards. DL Sheldon Richardson and DL Muhammad Wilkerson shared the Jets’ lone sack.\nSpecial teams: D \nThe Jets were guilty of an incredible gaffe that could have been costly in a closer game. They had only 10 men on the field for a fourth-quarter punt by Ryan Quigley from his own end zone. The Redskins blocked the kick and recovered it for a TD. K Nick Folk connected on two of three field-goal attempts, missing from 49 yards. Jeremy Kerley had a 22-yard punt return, his longest of the season.\nCoaching: B+ \nThe failure of coach Todd Bowles and special teams coordinator Bobby April to notice they were a man short on that punting situation lowers the grade. Otherwise, Bowles and his staff were solid. He and DC Kacy Rodgers did a good job of getting Richardson back into the mix in his return from a four-game suspension, using a lot of 4-3 fronts to do so. OC Chan Gailey wisely stuck with a good thing by continuing to utilize Ivory extensively, even dialing up three screen passes to him for 50 yards.\n— J.P.
