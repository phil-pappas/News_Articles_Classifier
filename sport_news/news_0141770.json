(AP) - The absence of two veteran receivers and his go-to tight end won't change a thing for Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco. \nFacing the Cleveland Browns on Sunday in an important AFC North matchup, the Ravens (1-3) will be without leading receiver Steve Smith and speedy Michael Campanaro, both of whom were injured last Thursday night in a win over the Steelers. \nTight end Crockett Gilmore, who has 10 catches for 151 yards and two touchdowns, missed practice Wednesday with a strained calf. \nThat leaves Flacco with less-heralded wide receivers Kamar Aiken, Marlon Brown and Chris Givens. The primary tight ends are rookies Maxx Williams and Nick Boyle. \nFlacco says, \"It's my job to see whoever the guy is that's open and give him a chance to make the catch.\" CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
