But Kelly said neither he nor his agent have heard from anyone in the college ranks.\n\"No,\" Kelly told reporters when asked Thursday morning.\nThe Eagles are an inconsistent 2-3 heading into the Monday night showdown against the New York Giants . The Eagles have yet to win a playoff game under Kelly. He came from a successful college program at Oregon . He said he understands why the rumors start.\n\"I understand that it's gonna happen. We're not successful, we're not winning, I came from college and I'm gonna go back to college,\" Kelly said. \"I hope some day to be like (New York Giants) Coach Coughlin and win enough games where I can stay around long enough where that speculation ends. But I understand you have to ask the question.\"\nKelly has been rumored to headed back to college almost since the day he arrived in Philadelphia. He was linked to Texas and Florida in the past. Most recently, he has been mentioned as a possible candidate at Southern California after Steve Sarkisian was fired.\n\"It's an unfortunate part of the game, and the other unfortunate part is there are people who have lost their jobs,\" Kelly said. \"Somebody, a friend of mine in Steve Sarkisian, is dealing with a big issue right now, and I wish him the best.\"\nThe best way for Kelly to stop the speculation is to win games. The Eagles could vault into the first place in the NFC East if they can defeat the Giants.\n-- Geoffrey C.
