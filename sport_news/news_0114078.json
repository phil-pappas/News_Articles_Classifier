They are designed to be stiffer, allow better energy transfer and offer more tread to prevent slipping when climbing rocky and craggy mountains. Once you decide whether you need shoes for flat or clip less pedals, you have to look into other factors like stiffness, compatibility, comfort and fastening system. Whether you are out on a casual or a downhill ride, the right pair of shoe will ensure that you give your best performance and make the best of your bike ride. Here are four factors that need your consideration:Fastening systemMost mountain bike shoes have a Velcro strap or a buckle system. While the Velcro strap is easy to use and stays in place through mud and water, the buckle or ratchet system is known for its durability and offers an amazing fit. Shoes that come with a ratchet system have one buckle at the top and two Velcro straps beneath that. Some shoes also come with a combination of Velcro and buckle fasteners. In other shoes, laces in the fastening system are hidden in pockets to prevent them from getting dirty or caught in the chain.StiffnessWhile buying mountain biking shoes also consider the stiffness of the shoes. A stiff pair is excellent for long distance rides because it provides greater support to the feet. These shoes are excellent at transferring energy from the foot to the pedals and thus improve speed and performance. On the other hand, in bike rides that require more climbing flexible shoes are recommended.TreadDon't forget to take into account the amount of tread on the outsoles. Mountain biking requires shoes that offer greater tread so that you do not slip when riding up or down a steep hill. Moreover, in mountain biking shoes the cleats are recessed into the sole of the shoe. This prevents you from slipping when you are on your foot and climbing on rocks with your bike.BudgetYou do not have to necessarily buy the most expensive pair for your cycling endeavors. Most often, the most expensive models are only lightweight and come with certain fit adjustments. However, these features are not equally important to all riders. Mountain biking shoe brands have a range of prices to choose from. Make sure that you choose one that fits you best, offers great comfort and falls in your budget.Article Source: https://www.apsense.com/article/4-things-to-look-for-in-mountain-bike-shoes.html About the Author Diadora Cycling is a leading manufacturer of sports footwear.
