The Hurricanes had lost 10 in a row on the Avalanche's ice and managed just two ties in the last 19 seasons. \nRask's goal and Ward's performance helped end that streak and gave Carolina its second win in six games this season. \n\"I guess it's been a long time coming and we were due,\" Ward said. \"It's always a tough building to play in.\" \nIt was the first 3-on-3 overtime game for both teams. \nColorado's second group in the extra period got caught on the ice, leading to the goal. Murphy fed Rask in the slot, and Rask took the puck to the front of the net and beat Semyon Varlamov with a backhander. It was Rask's second of the season. \n\"They were out there a long time,\" Rask said. \"I had a step on the guy and just put it in the net.\" \nVarlamov finished with 18 saves. \nColorado had a great chance to win in regulation on an odd-man rush late in the third period. Jarome Iginla fed a pass across to Matt Duchene, who had Ward down and an open net in front of him, but the goalie got his stick on it to keep it scoreless. \n\"It's absolutely painful,\" Duchene said. \"I am probably going to have nightmares about that one. I made the move and got it upstairs just in case he was down and he sticks it out and just nicks it enough to go wide. I feel awful right now.\" \nIginla almost ended it early in overtime when he went alone into the Carolina zone. Ward made a save on the breakaway. \nSoon after, Rask scored to give the Hurricanes a 2-1 mark on their seven-game road trip. \n\"With 3-on-3 obviously you have to be ready for the scoring chance because they're going to be coming,\" Ward said. \"The way we've seen throughout the league, the goaltender has to make a big save and then hopefully you can turn it around and go back the other way. Fortunately we were able to do that.\" \nVarlamov returned to the net after backup Reto Berra played two games. Varlamov entered Wednesday 1-2 with a 5.06 goals-against average. He was pulled from his last start after allowing five goals on 19 shots against Boston a week ago. \nHe was much sharper against the Hurricanes, especially in the second period. He stopped center Elias Lindholm on a clear shot from the right circle and also made a glove save on Kris Versteeg's breakaway with 36 seconds left in the period. \nHe also stopped Nathan Gerbe on a shorthanded breakaway in the first. \n\"Both teams had some looks,\" Carolina coach Bill Peters said. \"Gerbe had a shorthanded breakaway, Versteeg was in alone and we had a 2-on-1 prior to the game going into overtime. We had opportunities we just didn't find a way to finish them. Good play by Victor taking it hard to the net.\" \nNOTES: Carolina D John-Michael Liles left the game late in the second period when he took a skate to the face from Iginla. He returned in the third period. After the game he said he took the butt of the skate to his two front teeth but was fine. ... Avalanche D Tyson Barrie served the second game of his three-game suspension for his hit on Anaheim D Simon Despres on Friday. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
