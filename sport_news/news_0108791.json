The hosts scored with virtually the last kick of the match through Islambek Kuat, but it mattered little.\nIt was also a night of celebration for Robin van Persie, who was introduced late to win his 100th cap for his country.\nEl Ghazi threatened first for the Dutch after seven minutes, cutting inside from the right before unleashing a left-footed shot that failed to trouble Kazakhstan goalkeeper Stas Pokatilov.\nThe Ajax winger got another chance shortly after following a sublime cross from Memphis Depay, but aimed his header from 5 yards out wide of the target.\nWijnaldum came close to breaking the deadlock in the 27th minute after a fine cross from El Ghazi but the Newcastle man’s header went over the crossbar.\nDepay should have opened the scoring just minutes later following a sublime through ball from Daley Blind, but the winger shot wide after ignoring the unmarked Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to his right.\nDanny Blind’s men did take the lead shortly after the half-hour mark, though. El Ghazi set up Wijnaldum with a clever layoff and the midfielder found the net with a low left-footed shot.\nEl Ghazi should have capped a fine first Netherlands outing with a goal in the dying seconds of the opening period after another superb cross from Depay, but his timing let him down as he volleyed it wide for a goal kick.\nThe Netherlands made a superb start to the second half and doubled its lead in the 50th minute. Huntelaar set up Sneijder after a fine team move and the Galatasaray star hammered home from a narrow angle.\nEl Ghazi nearly made it three after some good work from Virgil van Dijk minutes later, but his attempt was cleared off the line.\nWijnaldum got the chance to double his tally midway through the second half but blasted his shot from a narrow angle over the crossbar.\nTimur Dosmagambetov shot wide from inside the area in the 67th minute as Kazakhstan finally threatened. Yuri Logvinenko then nodded wide of a gaping goal shortly afterward.\nThey did halve the deficit deep into injury time as Kuat turned home Sergei Khizhnichenko's header back across the face of goal but there was no time for an equalizer.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:57:09.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
