Verbal commitments are non-binding, but Vaughn is expected to make it official on National Signing Day in February.\n\"I planned it that way,\" said Vaughn of his birthday announcement. \"It was a big-time decision and was something that I could give myself.\"\nThe 6-3, 195-pounder is ranked in seventh in the state according to Rivals.com and is ranked as the 18th-best safety nationally in the Class of 2016.\nVaughn had several offers and said he chose Notre Dame over Texas A&M and Tennessee. He made his official visit to South Bend on Sept. 5.\n\"They're big on academics, plus they're a big-time football program, so really it's the best of both worlds,\" said Vaughn, who plans to major in business management. \"It was hard to turn them down; you can really sense the tradition there.\"\nVaughn is the third player in Whitehaven's class of 2016 to verbally commit, joining wide receiver Kerrick Jones (Navy) and defensive tackle Michael Perry (Jacksonville State). He'll be the first local player to play for Notre Dame since Collierville's Matt Shelton, who played wide receiver there from 2001-2005.\nLIONS WIN REGION TITLE\nAlyssa Hall said it's not usually a problem to motivate her Harding volleyball team, especially not when a region championship is on the line.\nThe Lions — sparked by an MVP performance from Lauren Deaton — captured the Division 2-A West Regional tournament title Tuesday, turning back St. George's, 25-20, 25-14, 25-22.\n\"They usually motivate themselves, and they play better when they do,\" said Hall, whose team improved to 37-6. \"I told them to just relax and play their game. They knew how important this game was.\"\nHarding, the top seed in the west, will host King's Academy Saturday at 11 a.m. St. George's will host an opponent to be determined on Saturday with the winners advancing to next week's state tournament in Murfreesboro.\n\"I'm proud of our team,\" said Gryphons coach Emmy McClain. \"We have an eighth-grade setter, Annika Thompson, who's filled some really big shoes. But we also have six seniors and they do a great job building team unity.\"\nIn the third-place game, St. Mary's reached the final eight for the first time in school history, rallying from two down to beat ECS 10-25, 22-25, 25-17, 25-20, 15-13.\n\"We literally just took a couple of deep breaths and focused,\" said Turkeys coach Kari Duncan, who was honored as the region coach of the year. \"I told them we had nothing to lose; just have fun and remember why you play volleyball.\"\nSt. Mary's travels to play Zion Christian on Saturday while ECS visits nationally ranked Knoxville Webb.\nIn AAA, Bartlett won the Region 7 championship with a 25-22, 17-25, 27-25, 25-14 victory over Dyer County. On Thursday at 6 p.m., the Panthers (32-8) will host Region 8 runner-up White Station, which lost in three sets to Houston in the championship match. Houston will host Dyer County at 7 p.m. with both winners advancing to state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:31:49.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
