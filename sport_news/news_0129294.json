He did not take questions.\nMets manager Terry Collins told reporters Harvey called and said he got stuck in traffic.\n\"I just screwed up,\" Harvey said.\nNew York opens its NL playoff series against the Dodgers on Friday night in Los Angeles. Harvey is scheduled to start Game 3 at Citi Field next Monday.\n\"I'm concerned about the guys that are here. And the guys that are here, we had a great workout,\" Mets captain David Wright said. \"So you have to talk to Matt about that.\"\nHarvey was not on the field as the Mets went through drills from around noon to 2 p.m. General manager Sandy Alderson initially said he didn't know why Harvey was absent.\n\"Obviously, today was not the greatest. I know we had a mandatory workout. And the last thing I ever want to do is not be here for my team,\" Harvey said. \"Basically, there's no excuse. I screwed up. I wasn't here. I showed up a little late.\"\nHarvey's agent, Scott Boras, also was in the dark at first. He told The Associated Press by phone he wasn't sure why his client wasn't at the workout.\nThere was no word from the Mets about whether Harvey might be disciplined.\n\"I've talked to Sandy and I've talked to Terry and my teammates and apologized to them and apologized to everybody,\" Harvey said, wearing sweats and a Mets cap while seated in front of a microphone.\n\"They understand I'm here to get my workout in and be with the team. Unfortunately today, I screwed up. So there's not really anything else to say. They know what happened and I told everybody and apologized to everybody, told them it's not going to happen again. It's never happened before and unfortunately it happened kind of at a bad time.\"\nHarvey's time in New York has been anything but drama-free. The right-hander was in the middle of a ruckus last month over his workload on the mound in his first season back from Tommy John surgery. He finished 13-8 with a 2.71 ERA in 29 starts and 189 1-3 innings.\n___\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
