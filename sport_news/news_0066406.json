He asked the Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology to take the responsibility of accepting this challenge and look for new techniques in the agricultural sector. The Chief Minister was speaking at the closing ceremony of the 98th All-India Farmer Fair and Agro Industry Exhibition organised at the university. More than 10,000 farmers from across the country participated in the exhibition. As many as 600 stalls were set up on the occasion. The Chief Minister said the prosperity of any country was measured through agricultural growth. He asked policy makers of the Central and state governments to ensure that any research related to agriculture did not face any difficulty. The Chief Minister said the cultivating area was shrinking drastically while the underground water level was falling due to the cultivation of three crops in the same land within one year. “This is a major cause of concern for scientists, farmers and stakeholders. They will have to take collective measures to increase productivity capacity with minimum water consumption,” he said. He said water bodies and ponds would be developed for water conservation in the hill areas while efforts were needed for water harvesting and conservation in sub-mountain regions. The Chief Minister asked scientists and VC Dr Mangla Rai to develop new agricultural techniques to accelerate production. Earlier, the Chief Minister inaugurated Dr YL Naine examination hall at the university. It has been constructed at a cost of Rs 1.10 crore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:06:17.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
