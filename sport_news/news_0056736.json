Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch teamed up with the coffee company to craft a limited edition drink — which, of course, was dubbed \"Beast Mode.\" It's a double mocha Frappuccino with mint, cream and protein powder—topped with whipped cream, purple berry drizzle and matcha. Starbucks will donate up to $100,000 to Lynch's foundation via the 24 cents donated per drink sold in Washington and Oakland stores, per KIRO 7 . The Seattle-based company will also kickstart the campaign with a base $24,000 donation. The limited edition drink will reportedly be available Oct. 22 through the end of the NFL season.
