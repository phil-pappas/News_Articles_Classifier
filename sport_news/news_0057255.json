Mayfield was on a whole new level, tossing five touchdowns and racking up 282 yards.\nHubener received little help in the run game, as Kody Cook only rushed for 19 yards and Charles Cook 18 yards. The Wildcats were only able to account for 110-yards on the day.\nThe defensive unit didn’t have much time to rest in between possessions, but never did have an answer for the Sooner attack. Mixon, Perine, and Brooks all took over 10 carries for at least 41 yards, with Mixon taking one of his 15 carries into the end zone.\nThe Sooners were extremely effective in reading the defense and setting up each facet of the game, as running screens on blitz’s and going deep when K-State packed the box, provided lots of offensive fireworks early.\nCook did come in at the end of the game in place of Hubener, but did little to impress going one for eight and throwing an interception.\nAfter two strong performances against top teams, the blowout loss might have been inevitable for the heavily injured Wildcat squad. Dropping to 3-3 on the season, Kansas State is in need of win to snap their three game losing streak.\nThey’ll look to pull it off with an easier matchup on Saturday, as the Wildcats travel to Texas to take on the Longhorns at 11:00 a.m.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
