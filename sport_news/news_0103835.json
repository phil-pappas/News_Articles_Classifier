Patrick Stadium, as the Tigers capitalized late in the game to win 27-19. \nThe game was more tightly contested than the eight-point final score indicated, as Gautier gave a valiant effort but fell short at the end. \nSophomore quarterback Dandre Humbles led the offense for the Tigers, as he threw for two touchdowns and helped the running game with some tough rushing yards of his own. \nGautier was up 7-0 early after scoring from the one-yard line with just under four minutes to play in the first quarter. \n“At times, we didn’t take assignments that we were supposed to take,” Hattiesburg coach Tony Vance said. “They were able to move the chains on things like that.” \nWith the second quarter underway, Humbles threw a dagger to junior Jordan Murphy, setting the Tigers up at the 20-yard line. On the next series of downs, sophomore Fabian Franklin executed a halfback wheel from the left side, catching the pass from Humbles in the end zone to tie the game at 7-7. \n“We have to come out and play harder,” Vance said. “Also, we have to just be disciplined.” \nThe game later pulled to 21-19, with 9:18 left to play. The Tigers had a chance to put the game away, starting at the Gator three-yard line facing first and goal. \nHumbles tried to capitalize on the possession himself on a scramble and play action roll-out, but failed to score, leaving the Tigers facing a fourth and goal from the three-yard line. \nHumbles then threw a jump ball to Murphy, scoring the potential game-clinching touchdown with 8:55 left to play. \n“I thought they had to make plays when they had to make plays,” Vance said. “Guys stepped up and did what they had to do to get the win.” \nThe Gators had a crucial drive going down the field, with just 4:34 left to play. Senior quarterback Le’Charles Pringle led the Gators down inside the Hattiesburg 40 yard line, behind a dominant offensive line. \nFacing a third and seven from the 46-yard line, senior Roy Rogers converted the crucial possession to give the Gators life with 2:20 left on the clock. \nGoing up against third and 12 after an offensive penalty, Pringle stepped back to throw, but he cost his team the efforts. Sophomore Raykell Ducksworth intercepted Pringle, ending the game with just under two minutes left. \n“It was a great interception and a great job of maintaining possession,” Vance said. “It gave us a chance to run the clock out.” \nThe possession capitalized a stalwart effort from the Tiger defense, who held Gautier to only 19 points. \n“I thought our entire defense played well,” Vance said. “We did a good job of controlling the clock.” \nHattiesburg will host Pearl River Central on Oct. 30. 25 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1S1YdUK TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:00:00.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
