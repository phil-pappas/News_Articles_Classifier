He was only about a foot away but, somehow, the ball hit the back of the cup and popped back out.\nIt’s a seriously rotten piece of luck. He didn’t hit the ball overly hard and it rolled straight in the middle of the hole. What’s likely is that the hole itself was cut slightly incorrectly, which caused the ball to rebound back out of the hole.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:58:48.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
