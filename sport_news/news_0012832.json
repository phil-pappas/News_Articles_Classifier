Manuel Pucciarelli couldn't get on the end of a cross from Piotr Zielinski on the left flank but Rade Krunic was there to slot in at the back post for his first Serie A goal. \nZielinski got on the scoresheet himself shortly before the hour, heading in the rebound after Massimo Maccarone hit the bar. \nInter Milan can move two points clear of Fiorentina ahead of the Tuscan side's match at home to second-placed Roma Sunday. \nBottom club Bologna also plays later, against fellow promoted side Carpi. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:05:38.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
