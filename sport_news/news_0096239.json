TEAM LINE-UPS Calvin Dinsley V S: Andy Wright. \nKidderminster: Snedkner; Hodgkiss, Rowe-Turner, Langmead, Young; Maxwell, Whitfield, Dinsley; Murphy (Styche 58), Hassan, Francis-Angol. \nSubs not used: Palmer, Tunnicliffe, Campbell, Forsyth. \nSouthport: Crocombe; Challoner, Foster, Wright, Davies; Almond, Jones, Joyce, Nolan; Stockton (Phenix 62, Rutherford 87), Bishop. \nSubs not used: Viscosi, Thompson, Blakeman. \nReferee: Derek Eaton (Gloucs). \nAttendance: 1,593 (89 away fans). \nHarriers are now eight points away from safety and will be desperate to end their grim winless run when they visit Stourbridge on Saturday for an eagerly-awaited FA Cup fourth qualifying round clash. \nTheir hopes of opening their victory account against the Sandgrounders looked a possibility at times, but luck deserted them during the first-half when new-boy Ben Whitfield had two efforts strike the woodwork. \nThey also failed to take their chances in the second period, particularly on 69 minutes when substitute Reece Styche’s ball control let him down when he was in an excellent position to break the deadlock. \nHarriers’ failure to find the net made it a frustrating afternoon for head coach Dave Hockaday, who felt his new-look side had not deserved to lose. \nHe added: “All the old football sayings come to mind and I’m really scratching my head to wonder how we’ve lost that game. But we have and we’ve got to take it on the chin. \n“We’ve got to keep believing, because nobody is going to feel sorry for us and we don’t expect that.” \nHarriers lost their two games against Southport by a similar scoreline last season. \nBut they did produce a first-half display which suggested they were capable of securing their first win since triumphing 3-1 at home to Braintree Town on March 28. \nOn 27 minutes, they went perilously close to nudging ahead when the eye-catching Whitfield fired in a curling shot which rebounded off a post. \nNine minutes later, luck deserted him again when the midfielder’s first-time shot, following a teasing cross from captain Jared Hodgkiss, smacked against the bar.
