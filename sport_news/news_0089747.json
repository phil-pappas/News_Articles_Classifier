(Photo: Dan Holm/The Register) Buy Photo \nThe 2012 state champions being one win away from back-to-back district titles may not seem like a huge accomplishment, but the Ankeny Hawks know how far they've come. \nIn July, they wondered how good a team with one returning offensive starter and a first-time head coach could be. This week, coach Rick Nelson's club is playing in one of seven de facto district title games across Iowa, splitting unbeaten ties for first place with one head-to-head showdown. \n\"We want to win the district championship, but what we'd really like is that No. 1 seed that comes with it,\" Nelson said. \"That's an even bigger bonus. \n\"Everybody would like to be a No. 1 seed going into the playoffs. If you're one of the district champs, it's not a given, but it's a little easier path to get to the dome than if you're the two, three or four.\" Breaking down Iowa's tightest prep football playoff races \nNo. 6 Ankeny (7-1, 4-0) plays at Southeast Polk (5-3, 4-0) Friday night to claim the Class 4A District 1 championship. While it isn't the most highly-ranked of the Week 9 district deciders, it may be the most hotly-contested. \nSince its 0-3 start, Southeast Polk has won five straight games by an average of 36 points. Ankeny's only loss came on a 52-yard last-second field goal to previously ranked Johnston. And of course, Southeast Polk coach Brad Zelenovich was with the Hawks for the last two seasons. \n\"I'm not really sure how I compare to (Zelenovich), because I don't know if I coach like him or it's a 180 (degrees), I don't know,\" Nelson said, \"but the assistant coaches pretty much remained the same for the kids and that was a huge plus.\" \nThe other 4A spot that has saved the best for last comes in District 7. Iowa City West (3-5, 3-0) survived its 0-4 start and can be the state's only sub-.500 district champion with a win at No. 9 Pleasant Valley (6-2, 3-0). \nRELATED: Hoover, Lincoln linked in dual playoff push​ \nQualifying from the Quad Cities the night before will be the winner of the 3A-5 tilt between No. 10 Washington (7-1, 5-0) and Davenport Assumption (6-2, 5-0). The Demons will rely on sophomore quarterback Ryan Reighard and his nearly 2,300 total yards and 28 touchdowns to clinch first-place on Thursday, while Assumption tries to find a foothold in 3A just two seasons removed from 4A football in the Mississippi Athletic Conference. \nThe 2A highlight on Friday night comes with No. 2 South Tama (8-0, 5-0) taking on No. 4 Aplington-Parkersburg (7-1, 5-0) for the top spot in District 6. It's a classic \"unstoppable force versus immovable object\" matchup – the Falcons are scoring 54 points per game in district play, while South Tama has allowed one offensive touchdown all year – that has been left to heat up until the last week of the regular season. \n\"Something's got to give in a game like this, so hopefully we're not the ones giving in,\" South Tama coach Jay Hoskey said. \n\"Two years ago we were playing in a pretty good 3A district and on defense we were starting probably five of these seniors as sophomores. They took their lumps and still played well. Now we've got a bunch of guys playing well, they're well-coached by my assistants, and we just play consistent, 11-man football.\" \nAll 14 teams featured in these title-deciding games have already earned home-field advantage in next Wednesday's first round. But winning Friday could mean securing another round at home, maintaining a win streak, and a potentially easier matchup with a fourth-place team instead of a tighter two-seed vs. three-seed game. \n\"Home-field is more comfortable with the preparation and travel time, but more than that you just want to gain momentum going into the playoffs,\" Hoskey said. \"You want to think you can beat anybody and go far in this situation and hopefully get to the UNI-Dome someday. We're getting a good test.\" \nThe road trip is more than two hours for Pocahontas (7-1, 5-0), but with the 1A-3 title on the line, fans will flock to No. 7 Saint Ansgar (7-1, 5-0) on Friday. The Saints have won six in a row by an average of 43 points, but Pocahontas is dangerous with a strong defense and star senior Tanner Youngberg, who has nine receiving touchdowns and an 11-player best nine interceptions on the season. \nClass A gets a pair of ranked showdowns to decide two first-place squads: No. 10 West Hancock (7-1, 5-0) visits No. 2 Algona Garrigan (8-0, 5-0) and No. 9 Pekin (7-1, 6-0) tries to unseat No. 5 Winfield-Mount Union. The higher ranked teams are home and if they stay unbeaten, they could be playing at home for another few weeks. \nAfter all the hard work of getting to Week 9 undefeated in district play, that's all these teams want. \n\"We went to Simpson College's camp and thought, 'Oh boy, have we got some work to do,' \" Nelson said. \"But the kids kept showing up and do exactly what we ask of them and we've gotten better. I am a little surprised at how this has gone, but now that I know the coaches and the kids, I can see the work ethic and we'll see what happens on Friday.\" <a href=\"//8115148.polldaddy.com/s/high-school-insider-pick-em-week-9\">View Survey</a> 3 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1LM63RA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:29:04.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
