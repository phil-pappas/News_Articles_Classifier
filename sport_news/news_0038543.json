People came to view the designs created by students in the Sioux Falls district. \nThere was controversy with some religious designs last year, but City officials say they would not censor the students work. Now, each plow has a disclaimer decal that says the city encourages creativity. One New Technology High School student says he didn't hold back his creativity when it came to his school's unique design. \n\"So we created the mask and I wanted it to look fierce so I made him like all angry, so when it's coming at the snow its like 'Ugh! I want to eat you!'\" New Technology High School Student Michael Tetrault said. \nThe public had the opportunity to vote on their favorite design. The winner of the competition will be announced next week.
