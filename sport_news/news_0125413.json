Chile were playing official World Cup qualifiers and he is an important player for them so they will use him if they can.\n\"He is a guy that always wants to play so I knew that was always going to be a tricky situation.\"\nWenger also said that defender Laurent Koscielney was having a test to see if he would be available following the hamstring injury he picked up against Olympiakos Piraeus in the Champions League at the end of last month, but that Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini had recovered from their knocks and were available for selection.\n\"We have three players who could come back and be available again and I don't think we lost anybody from our last game,\" said the Frenchman.\nWenger was attending Arsenal's annual general meeting later on Thursday.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:55:38.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
