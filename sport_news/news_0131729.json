From here will be determined the future of both Bihar and the country. You have to decide whether from here on the country will move towards divisiveness or harmony.”\nKick-starting her party’s poll campaign, she said the Prime Minister is an expert in packaging and repackaging.\n“Modi is trying to mislead the people of Bihar. The package he announced is more farcical than real. What is the truth of this package? Prime Minister, an expert in packaging and repackaging, has simply rehashed old schemes of previous governments and presented them as a new package. What not he has said to belittle the people of Bihar,” she said, asking people to choose whether they are with secular forces or those which divide the country.\nRaking up RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s remarks on reservation, Sonia, without naming Bhagwat or RSS, said, “There is match fixing going on between Nagpur and BJP. But I want to tell you that Congress is committed to Constitutional provisions on SC, ST and OBC quotas.”\nTerming the 15-month rule of Modi as “harmful” for the country, the Congress chief said, “Except for a few corporates no one has benefited”.\n“You are all aware of the 15-months’ record of BJP’s policies that have adversely affected the country. Hasn’t unemployment increased, have budget cuts not been made on welfare schemes for women, are farmers getting fair price for their produce,” Sonia said mocking at the NDA alliance as “Bhanumati ka kunba” (coming together of odd forces).\n“Put all your strength to defeat such forces who want to divide society, make false promises and who have hurt Bihar’s pride,” she said.\nSeeking votes in the name of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whom she described as an “able CM with a clean image”, she also questioned the PM over his foreign trips taunting him for “spending more time abroad than at home”.\nSonia also charged that Modi was discriminating with opposition chief ministers and states ruled by them and questioned his ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ slogan, asking whether people of such states did not belong to the country. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:30:26.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
