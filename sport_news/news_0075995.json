He looked fantastic today and I really feel good about the way he's coming into this race.\"\nThe Breeders' Cup Classic will be run at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky on Oct. 31, giving American Pharoah plenty of time to regroup after finishing a shocking second in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga in August.\n\"We were 50-50 as to whether or not we were going to run in that race,\" Baffert said of the Travers Stakes. \"Unfortunately, he didn't really run his race and coming out of it, I could tell everything ... had kind of taken its toll.\n\"He needs the 60 days (leading into the Classic). This horse, he runs well fresh.\"\nBaffert said American Pharoah was likely to be flown to Kentucky from California early next Tuesday.\nAmerican Pharoah entered the pantheon of U.S. thoroughbred racing's all-time greats by winning the Belmont Stakes wire-to-wire in June to become the first horse to capture the coveted 'Triple Crown' in nearly four decades.\nIn winning a seventh straight race, American Pharoah became the 12th horse and first since Affirmed in 1978 to sweep the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.\nAfter making his farewell racing performance in the Breeders' Cup Classic, the muscular son of 2009 Kentucky Derby runner-up Pioneer of the Nile will then retire to stud.\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes ; Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:53:03.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
