By Danielle Joynson , Staff ReporterFiled: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 at 07:20 UK Last Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 at 07:25 UK \nLe'Veon Bell gave Pittsburgh Steelers a late 24-20 victory over San Diego Chargers by scoring on a one-yard wildcat run with zero seconds on the clock at the Qualcomm Stadium on Monday night. \nIt was a risky move with just five seconds of normal time remaining, but it came off as Bell took the direct snap and managed to get the ball across the line in the end zone after being charged at by his opponents. \nThe Chargers opened the scoring in the first quarter as Antonio Gates , who made his return from a four-game PED suspension, caught from a 12-yard pass from Philip Rivers . \nThe hosts had a slender 7-0 lead after the first quarter and they kept a four-point advantage until Antwon Blake intercepted Rivers and returned it 70 yards for a touchdown to swing the momentum in Steelers' direction after half time. \nIn the fourth quarter, with Steelers leading 10-7, Gates and Rivers scored their 73rd combined touchdown, the most between a quarterback and tight end in NFL history, but Markus Wheaton responded at the other end after catching Mike Vick 's 72-yard pass. \nThe drama came in the closing seconds of the clash when Vick led a 24-yard scramble before sending a 16-yard pass to Heath Miller at the one-yard line. \nSteelers took the wildcat risk in the hope of taking victory, and they managed to pull it off to give themselves their third win of the season.
