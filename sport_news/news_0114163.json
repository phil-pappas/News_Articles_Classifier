The Phillies fired general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. Thursday, with 22 games left in their worst season since 1972. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) PHILADELPHIA (AP) Two people familiar with the decision say the Philadelphia Phillies will hire Matt Klentak to be their general manager.\nAdChoices Both people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Saturday because the team hasn't announced the move. The 35-year-old Klentak had been the Angels assistant general manager since November 2011.\nKlentak replaces Ruben Amaro Jr. He was fired in September by new team president Andy MacPhail.\nKlentak previously worked for MacPhail in Baltimore as the Orioles director of baseball operations from 2008-11. He then served as the No. 2 man behind GM Jerry DiPoto for four seasons. Klentak interviewed for DiPoto's job after he resigned this summer. The Angels hired Billy Eppler earlier this month.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:34:46.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
