I look forward to serving this university community to the best of my ability. I think we have wonderful opportunities here so it's just a real privilege at this stage in my career to have this new challenge and opportunity.\"\nThe board of trustees met Thursday morning before making the announcement. Nikki Zollar, chairwoman of the presidential search committee, expressed her sadness over President Wayne Watson's retirement and her excitement about Calhoun's selection.\n\"I think he's going to be fantastic,\" Zollar said. \"I think that he will work well with every group that is important to the university.\"\nCalhoun holds multiple degrees in philosophy, science and education. He is also an ordained itinerant elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. His contract begins Jan. 1 and ends Dec. 31, 2020. He will be paid a base salary of $300,000 and will have full use of the president's mansion and a car.\n\"His qualifications are impeccable, his experience has great depth to it and equally as important, his vision, his vision as an educator, is something that is going to take Chicago State University to the next level,\" Watson said. \"I'm very pleased.\"\nThe search for a new president began in May after Watson, who has led the school since 2009, announced he would retire. During his time as president, the university had its accreditation renewed and established better relations with the community. However, his tenure was marred by declining enrollment and whistleblower lawsuits.\nAfter the meeting, Watson's critics said they were pleased with the announcement and expressed their support for Calhoun.\n\"Of the three candidates, I thought he was the best,\" said Robert Bionaz, a Chicago State professor and chapter president of the University Professionals of Illinois, who sued Watson in federal court for allegedly trying to shut down a faculty blog. \"I thought that his ideas in terms of what he wanted to do at the school were good, I thought he was personable, I think he will be useful in terms of raising money and I think he comes in with at least a basic understanding of some of the problems.\"\nZollar said Calhoun was the only candidate of the three finalists that had overwhelming support from students, faculty and staff.\n\"Each group that interviewed the candidates rated them in certain categories, and that information was put together for us and it showed that Dr. Calhoun had the highest rating in every category from every constituency,\" Zollar said. \"It was like a tidal wave. There's no stopping him.\"\nChicago Tribune's Jodi Cohen contributed.\ngwong@tribpub.com\nTwitter @gracewong630\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Colleges and Universities Education Chicago State University", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616e3bd/turbine/ct-chicago-state-new-president-met-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:10:54.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
