(Katie Meyers / UCLA Athletics Â« By John Reid \nDaily News Staff Writer \nThere was a time not long ago when Matt Dickerson thought he might not play football again. Dickerson, a Serra High of San Mateo grad of 2014, is playing plenty for UCLA's defensive front these days. Look for No. 99 when the Bruins visit Stanford Stadium for a Pac-12 game on Thursday, Oct. 15 at 7:30 p.m. \nDickerson, who played in 12 games as a reserve and on special teams as a freshman, became more vital to the Bruins' defense after starter Eddie Vanderdoes tore an ACL while celebrating a touchdown in the season opener. \n\"I'm not sure how Eddie's injury affected my playing time,\" Dickerson said. \"Our whole defensive line has stepped up.\" \nDickerson credits the junior Vanderdoes, as well as ex-Bruin Owamagbe Odighizuw, for taking him under their wings. Odighizuw, a defensive lineman, was drafted by the New York Giants in the third round of the NFL Draft last spring. \n\"I learned a lot from the older guys since I have been here,\" Dickerson said. \nDickerson's former coach at Serra, Patrick Walsh, cites Dickerson's versatility as one of his strengths. \n\"Matt can play multiple positions because he's athletic,\" Walsh said. \"He is at a crossroads where they can put him inside, making him 300 pounds because he has the frame for it. Or they can keep him slight, put him outside where he can run off the edge. It gives him the advantage over other people.\" Advertisement \nWhen Dickerson was a senior at Serra, he was one of the most ballyhooed players on the Peninsula, receiving scholarship offers from many major colleges. Two things happened that changed Dickerson's life, the first being a back injury. Dickerson sat out the entire football and basketball seasons because of two fractures in his vertebrae. \n\"It was hard to sit on the sideline for football and basketball,\" Dickerson said. \"Those were my two favorite sports. I really wanted to be out there.\" \n\"We lost an All-American defensive lineman in a season where we were pretty good,\" Walsh said. \"We lost his practice intensity and his work ethic. Matt loves football. He's one of those guys who sleeps and drinks football.\" \nDickerson was all set to play for Notre Dame when his father, Clarence, was stricken with prostate cancer. Clarence, who played football at Henderson State in Arkansas, has since recovered. However, at the time Matt Dickerson felt he needed to stay closer to home, so he switched allegiance to UCLA. \n\"It was the best decision I ever made,\" Dickerson said. \"We have a great staff. I can't complain.\" \nThe Bruins started this season 4-0, rising to No. 7 in the nation before being upset by unranked Arizona State last week. \n\"Give credit to ASU,\" Dickerson said. \"We have to look at the film to see what we need to do to get better.\" \nUCLA (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) is idle until its date with the Cardinal in what should be a sold-out Stanford Stadium. Dickerson expects many family and friends to be there. \n\"It's a big game,\" Dickerson said. \"I'm looking forward to coming back to my roots.\" \nDickerson is 6 feet 4 and 290 pounds. \n\"I'm still getting used to playing at this size,\" Dickerson said. \"In high school, I was never heavier than 260 or 270 pounds. It's still new. I'm trying to adapt.\" \nDickerson earned a half of a sack last season in a game against Memphis and had a full sack at UNLV earlier this season. Dickerson has seven tackles on the year, four solo. Far from satisfied, Dickerson is more than happy to be playing the game he loves. \n\"I've improved everywhere from last year,\" Dickerson said. \"When I went to training camp as a freshman, I was nervous when I put the pads on. I didn't want to reinjure my back. My back feels good, knock on wood.\" \nEmail John Reid at jreid@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at twitter.com/dailynewsjohn .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:24:49.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
