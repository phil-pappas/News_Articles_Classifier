The Lady Tigers had Buckeye on the ropes after holding leads in Games 4 and 5.\"We did,\" said KAHS volleyball coach Ken David. \"I think our inexperience of being in that position really was the thing that killed us.\"Shaunti Short led the Academy with 40 assists and four kills. Senior Alexis McDade dug up 22 and killed eight, and senior Kiersten Kinsey had 11 digs and five aces.The Academy led 11-4 in Game 4 before Buckeye mounted a comeback on the backs of Lady Tigers' errors. Academy made 13 direct errors after building the seven-point lead and Buckeye earned nine points during the stretch.Buckeye built its own five-point lead, 21-16, but the Lady Tigers fought back to tie it, 22-22. The Lady Hawks won four of the next six points to even the match, 2-2.\"We're learning how to win, but it's a process,\" David said. \"They're starting to see what they can do, but they get shocked by it. We can't get shocked by it.\"Academy let another lead disappear in Game 5. The Lady Tigers jumped out to a 4-0 stake, but couldn't hold it together as Buckeye scored 15 of the next 20 points to secure the win.\"We played not to lose and we have to play to win every single time,\" David said. \"We're growing some leaders, but we want everyone on the floor to be one. We'll get that confidence.\"Academy played Grand Canyon (3-9) in a non-section match Saturday.
