One play was probably 40 yards down the field on an interception and two guys targeted our quarterback while he was on his back.\n\"The third time he was hit late, their coaches were yelling out at us, 'He is faking, get up and off the field.' I'm trying to tend to a player who is hurt after an illegal act and Koz is yelling at me. He used the term, 'Old Fart,' and said, 'I'll meet you after the game.' \"\nFootball notes: DuPage Valley race turns into expected meat grinder Rick Armstrong And on it goes.\nThe annual grind that is the DuPage Valley football season continues in 2015 in the revamped conference which added District 204 schools Waubonsie Valley, Neuqua Valley and Metea Valley.\n\"Anybody can beat anybody else on a given night,\" Waubonsie Valley coach Paul Murphy said a...\nAnd on it goes.\nThe annual grind that is the DuPage Valley football season continues in 2015 in the revamped conference which added District 204 schools Waubonsie Valley, Neuqua Valley and Metea Valley.\n\"Anybody can beat anybody else on a given night,\" Waubonsie Valley coach Paul Murphy said a...\n(Rick Armstrong) Kozlowski, who is also Guerin's athletic director, vehemently denied the allegations and intimated that his own legal rights were being violated.\n\"He came running on the field saying that he is going to sue me and it's a lawsuit,\" Kozlowski said \"I didn't know what he was talking about, ranting and raving that I'm a moron and I don't know the rules. I told him I'd be more than happy to talk to him after the game. I'm assuming that's the threat. I don't know.\"\nBelskis said the penalty that sparked the argument with Kozlowski — blocking the younger Belskis far away from the play — was declared illegal by the IHSA this year.\nHe said Kozlowski objected to the call.\n\"That was what I was yelling at him, about the rule,\" Belskis said. \"I did not call him any names. I did say this was in the (new) rules. He did not say we would talk about it (after the game). What he said was that he'd meet me at the 50 (yard line) after the game and beat my ass. For him to be an administrator and act like that...\"\nBoth coaches are relatively new to their schools — it's Belskis' third season at Aurora Central and first as the Chargers' head coach, and Kozlowski's second at Guerin — and there is no history between them.\nBelskis was aware of the excitable Kozlowski's history of sideline theatrics directed at officials.\nKozlowski made winners of downtrodden programs at Wauconda and North Chicago, where the outspoken coach had his share of supporters and detractors.\n\"We heard about all this when he was up north, berating officials and other coaches,\" Belskis said. \"I can tell you firsthand it happened yesterday. We have video of his antics on the sideline. Now it is up to other people.\"\nKozlowski said he would never try to injure another player, and he was incredulous at the rock-throwing allegation. He said his players were in the locker room while Aurora Central's bus was departing, and there are no rocks at the school to throw.\n\"We will let the facts speak for themselves,\" Kozlowski said. \"What he's doing now is slandering me, and I'm not going to take it. It will harm my reputation and I'm not going to let him do that. He has now gone into a slippery slope and I look forward to having this all come out.\"\nBelskis insisted his team's bus was hit by rocks.\n\"We're not making that up,\" he said.\nMike Helfgot is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\n High School Football", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56008b88/turbine/ct-abn-football-notes-st-0922-20150921", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56008e62/turbine/ct-spt-0921-prep-fb-kozlowski-belskis-20150919"], "published": "2015-09-21T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:46:07.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
