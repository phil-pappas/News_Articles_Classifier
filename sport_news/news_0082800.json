Thus far, Davis has lived up to the hype. He is recognized as a strong contender for the Most Valuable Player Award after having attained career highs in nearly every major statistical category last season and having become the most efficient player in the N.B.A.\nHe reintroduced himself to the casual fan in the 2015 playoffs, averaging 31.5 points, 11 rebounds and 3 blocks and wowing crowds, even as his New Orleans Pelicans were swept out of the first round by the eventual champions, the Golden State Warriors. The teams open their season against each other Tuesday (10:30 p.m. Eastern, TNT).\nDavis’s team has improved along with him. But he may have trouble continuing to build on his achievements this season. No matter how good he is individually, the Pelicans will find it difficult to make it out of the first round, because their conference is so competitive and because New Orleans has yet to transform itself into a really impressive unit.\nIt does not help that entering the regular season, a good chunk of the Pelicans’ roster is sidelined for varying lengths of time. Tyreke Evans is slated to miss six to eight weeks after knee surgery, joining point guard Norris Cole, forward Quincy Pondexter and centers Omer Asik and Alexis Ajinca on the injury list. Another point guard, Jrue Holiday, will be limited to about 15 minutes a game through January, in an effort to avoid further injury to his leg.\nThe sudden shortage of point guards will force the Pelicans and their new coach, Alvin Gentry, to rely on a lesser player to run the offense, possibly the fan favorite Nate Robinson. But really, the pressure to make up for inactive teammates will be toughest on Davis. He will be expected to do enough early in the season to keep the Pelicans afloat until his supporting cast recovers. And if he does not manage to do so, expect the sky-high forecasts for this year to lose some altitude.\nDavis is likely the most compelling individual star in the league this season, and there is little question which team will be most captivating in contending with the pressure of proving skeptics wrong. The Golden State Warriors, despite having had one of the most dominant seasons in league history, still face their fair share of doubters.\nDoc Rivers, the coach of the Warriors’ most irksome rival, the Clippers, has been perhaps the most public of the skeptics. In a recent interview with Grantland , he implied that Golden State might have been less fortunate had it faced the Clippers or the Spurs in the postseason, a point that has been echoed by other analysts with less personal stake than the Clippers’ leader. Rivers did not mention it, but the Warriors were also lucky that their opponents in the finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers, were missing their second-best player, Kyrie Irving, for most of the series, and Kevin Love for all of it.\n The Warriors have responded to Rivers’s comments aggressively in the news media, but their lukewarm preseason performances may have offered extra ammunition for those wondering whether they are prepared to stage a repeat this season. Their roster has not changed much, though David Lee, who provided support in the postseason last year, has left for Boston. The only notable addition is Jason Thompson, an underrated defender and a good addition for a team that could use a little more frontcourt depth.\nThe Golden State personnel change that should most intrigue N.B.A. fans is Gentry’s move to New Orleans. The Pelicans’ new coach has long been known as an offensive mastermind, and his guidance helped the Warriors to the second best attack in the league. Golden State’s system is unlikely to change much, but it will be fascinating to see whether they can adjust to defenses that will be more familiar with their tactics after a full season of seeing them dominate.\nThe Pelicans, who had a solid, if stagnant, offense under Monty Williams, should see better movement with Gentry at the controls. They will most likely run fewer isolation plays for Davis and do a better job of getting him the ball when he is already in position to score. Given his teammates’ injuries and his own elite status, Davis will no doubt be working hard, but Gentry may be able to help lessen the load.\nIf the Pelicans are to succeed, though, their new coach will have to transform what has been a one-man wrecking crew into a coherent squad. And the Warriors, without Gentry, will have to show that they are still a coherent unit in order to shake off the doubts that have already arisen before the season has even begun.\n ", "external_links": ["http://stats.nba.com/league/team/", "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-edge-of-glory-will-the-clippers-make-the-leap-or-hit-reset/", "http://www.nola.com/pelicans/index.ssf/2015/09/jrue_holiday_will_be_under_min.html", "http://a1.nyt.com/assets/article/20151023-153751/images/foundation/logos/", "http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/year/2015", "http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/10/9/9489307/nba-klay-thompson-doc-rivers-warriors-clippers-sunflower-seeds"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:50:22.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
