Comment By Cindy Boren, The Washington Post Chillicothe News - Chillicothe, MO By Cindy Boren, The Washington Post Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 10:52 AM By Cindy Boren, The Washington Post Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 10:52 AM In \"this would only happen to the Chicago Cubs news,\" there's this little gem: The team's closer, Hector Rondon, was briefly trapped inside the Busch Stadium bullpen bathroom during Game 1 of the playoff series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Only a MacGyver-like move freed him when the lock on the door jammed in the middle innings of the Cubs' loss to the Cards on Friday. \"I was banging on the door: 'Hey, I'm locked in!'\" Rondon told reporters (via CSN Chicago). \"So they started to pull the door and I found like a metal [object]. I put it between the door and it finally opened, but I had been there for like five minutes.\" At some point, he might have wondered whether the Cubs, who haven't won the World Series since 1907, truly are cursed. . .if he hadn't been too busy trying to escape. \"I started looking which way to get out, because they had like [an opening] over the door,\" he said. \"So I think like: 'Oh my God, I have to jump over there.'\" At least he didn't have to go Johnny Quinn on the door.
