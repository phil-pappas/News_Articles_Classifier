It's going again now and I'm looking forward to the next games. \n\"I needed to be a part of this. I play for my country. I'm proud to do it. There are no small games and I have given everything I have for City, I will always do this, but I do the same for my country.\" \nKevin de Bruyne is also raring to go for City after scoring his sixth goal in seven games for club and country. Kompany insists he is \"not surprised at all\" by his compatriot's rich vein of form since a summer move from Wolfsburg. \n\"I've known him for a long time now, but just it's a natural development,\" Kompany explained. \n\"We play very offensive football at City, which is perfect for him, but we want to show that with Belgium too, and it suits him. When we have players like him, fit and doing well, we can beat any team.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:13:11.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
