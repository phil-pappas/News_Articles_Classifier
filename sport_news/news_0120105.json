Major droughts, floods and famines force people to migrate and \"increase the risk of conflicts,\" he said.\nIn addition, making the transition to renewable energy sources will help ease power struggles over the control of oil and natural gas resources, Fabius added.\nDefense ministers of neighboring Chad and Niger described the growing desertification of Africa's Sahel region as a multiplier of threats —especially in the troubled Lake Chad region, which is facing frequent attacks by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram.\nMahamadou Karidjo, Niger's defense minister, said his government's main concern was \"to ensure that Nigerien people don't starve to death\" amid climate changes.\nHaitian Defense Minister Lener Renauld stressed the importance of curbing global warming.
