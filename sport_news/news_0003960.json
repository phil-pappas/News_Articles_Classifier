[and] very slight-framed girl,” Detective Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans from the child abuse squad told 2GB Radio on Thursday.\n“These adult males are quite large men,” he said.\nPolice believe the girl was either unconscious or semi-conscious at the time of the attack – which she did not report – but officers have since made contact and interviewed her.\nThe girl is undergoing counselling.\nA 17-year-old boy, a 23-year-old and two 24-year-olds have since been charged with a string of offences, including sexual assault in company. A 25-year-old has been charged with concealing a serious indictable offence.\nAll five have been refused bail and were due to face courts at Penrith and Mount Druitt on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:48:50.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
