(AP) - Matt Ryan threw for 251 yards and a touchdown pass, and Devonta Freeman ran for 116 yards as the Atlanta Falcons held off the Tennessee Titans 10-7 Sunday. \nThe Falcons (6-1) bounced back from their first loss this season by grinding out a road win and overcoming two interceptions. Freeman notched his third consecutive game with at least 100 yards, and Atlanta outgained Tennessee 378-256. \nThe banged-up Titans (1-5) lost their fifth straight overall and ninth consecutive on their home field dating back to last season. They played without rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota and two starters in their secondary. Their defense kept them close, giving Tennessee plenty of chances needing only a field goal to force overtime. \nBut Zach Mettenberger was intercepted by Falcons safety Robenson Therezie with 1:31 left to seal Atlanta's victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:51:34.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
