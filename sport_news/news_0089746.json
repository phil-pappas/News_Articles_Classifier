He played well against the Cardinals, completing 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns.\n\"We were not shocked by his performance, but we were pleased by it,\" Tomlin said.\nThe Steelers (4-2) have gone 2-1 without Roethlisberger. However, Vick has struggled, completing 40 of 66 passes for 371 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.\nOffensive coordinator Todd Haley called more low-risk plays for Vick, who signed as a free agent at the end of the preseason when backup quarterback Bruce Gradkowski was placed on injured reserve with a hand injury.\nThe Steelers, though, will likely open up the offense more if Jones starts. He had extensive action in the preseason as he played five games rather than the normal four because of the Steelers appearance in the Hall of Fame game.\n\"He took advantage of those reps, like we all talked about during the course of the preseason, but regular season is different from the preseason,\" Tomlin said.\n\nSeattle's slow start confounds Carroll\nWhen Pete Carroll struggled as a head coach during his first stint in the NFL, and when Southern California was in its rebuilding phase during his early years in Los Angeles, there was a talent gap that explained some of the shortcomings.\nThat is why Carroll, above all others in the Seattle Seahawks hierarchy, is struggling to understand where his current team stands now. A team with starting talent the envy of many in the NFL could at 2-4 be arguably the biggest disappointment in the league through the first six weeks. \n\"I haven't really been in this kind of situation with a really good team where it felt so much different and the results are flipping,\" Carroll said.\nThe Seahawks sit at a crossroads headed into Thursday's game at San Francisco, beginning a critical two-week stretch that will determine where this season goes. Seattle is already facing long odds to reach its goal of making the playoffs. Only 8 percent of teams since 1990 that have started 2-4 ended up playing in the postseason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:35:56.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
