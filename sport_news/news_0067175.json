TAMMANY PARISH, LA (WVUE) - The family of a missing St. Tammany Parish woman say they’re hoping remains found in a burned vehicle, don’t belong to Me’Shell King. The coroner is testing the remains as the sheriff’s office confirms the car’s make and part of the license plate match those of the missing woman.\nIt’s been over three weeks since Me’Shell King was last seen alive.\n“It is bizarre, and I’ll tell you one thing, she would never go off and leave her child,” said the woman's mother, Cheryll Yates.\nOn Sunday afternoon, says two women walking in a rural area off Highway 16 in Sun stumbled upon the burned car and found bones inside, according to the Sheriff's Office.\n“Our coroner’s office has positively identified the bones in the vehicle as human remains and will take the next four or five days trying to process that evidence to make a positive identification of the individual,” Sheriff Jack Strain said.\nThe burned out car is a Mitsubishi, the same type of car King owned. And part of the license plate matches King’s.\n“It scared me and scared me bad, but I have to have hope,” Yates said.\nMe’Shell King was last seen leaving her job at the Shell station in Bush on Sept. 20. Yates says thousands of people across the country have pitched in to find her, and they’ll continue to look.\n“We are holding up by our faith that until we have confirmation that this is Me’Shell, then she has not been found yet,” Yates said.\nSheriff Jack Strain says the investigation is far from over.\n“Until we know for a fact that it is or is not Miss King, we’ll continue to work her as a missing person,” Strain said.\nYates said her daughter is an incredibly kind person who would give the shirt off her back to someone in need. She just can’t imagine why Me’Shell is missing, or why anyone would want to harm her.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
