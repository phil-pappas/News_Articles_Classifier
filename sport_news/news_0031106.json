Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 4:03 PM Updated at 6:09 PM Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 4:03 PM Updated at 6:09 PM The term nemesis is typically reserved for the most troublesome of enemies. And it’s for good reason — the official definition is “an opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome.” In the current NFL landscape , when arranging a list pertaining to the Carolina Panthers, one club sits at the top — the Seattle Seahawks. Ahead of Sunday's clash In Seattle, it’s fitting to examine the history between the two sides. It’s a relationship that’s been one-sided, with Carolina left reeling more often than not. Seattle leads the all-time series, 7-2, including a 2-0 record in postseason play. To find the last Panther win over the Seahawks, you have to go all the way back to December of 2007. During that stretch, Seattle has claimed five straight. But it’s been the last three seasons where this rivalry has really taken shape and the Seahawks have molded themselves into a true nemesis status. Since 2012, Seattle has taken four games from Carolina, including last January’s 31-17 triumph in the divisional playoffs. Aside from that game — a scoreline that didn’t exactly flatter Seattle’s dominance on the night, in fairness — the nature of the Seahawks’ last three regular season wins are what likely sit lowest in the guts of Panther players and fans. Losses in 2012, 2013 and 2014 came by a grand total of 13 points — a measly 4.3 per game. Three years ago, a potential game-winning score was snuffed out in the closing minutes when the Panthers couldn’t convert on fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line. In 2013, a late DeAngelo Williams fumble in the red zone killed another Carolina opportunity for a go-ahead score. And last season, it was Russell Wilson who led the Seahawks on a late drive that secured the winning touchdown with 53 seconds remaining. The opportunities have been plenty for Carolina. The results? None. Team that with having to sit back and watch Seattle’s wild success over the past several seasons makes that nemesis tag much more legitimate. Having been branded the “worst undefeated team in the NFL” by the majority of the national media, this game could serve as a decent barometer for Carolina. Victory over a quality club it’s been so ruthlessly tortured by just might show the Panthers’ readiness to emerge as a true contender. A loss, whether fair or not, likely comes with those “same old Panthers” cries. One player who should be particularly motivated is quarterback Cam Newton, who, like the team he plays for, has been questioned about when he will take that next step. That time should be now. So far, no quarterback in the league has done more with less. A 7-to-2 touchdown-to-interception ratio also suggests a heightened concern for the football. At this point, Newton is in the early conversation for MVP. Page 2 of 2 - But in each outing against Seattle, Newton has struggled. A career completion percentage of 57 in the losses to the Seahawks have seen Newton account for just three scores and 170.8 yards per game. Should the fifth-year man now finally get a win over this team he’s never beaten, it could serve as a springboard for things to come. With Atlanta’s loss Thursday at New Orleans, this game still remains much more than a contest against an aggravating opponent. Getting to the top of your division is the most important thing in the NFL, as Carolina knows all too well after receiving a playoff spot last year despite a losing record. A win in Seattle would supply a game of separation from the Falcons. Doing it against the Seahawks would just be the cherry.
