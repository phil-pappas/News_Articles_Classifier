So that's good news,\" Gibbons said.\nDonaldson did not speak to reporters afterward. His status for Friday's Game 2 is uncertain.\n\"Hopefully he can bounce back and be back in the lineup tomorrow,\" catcher Russell Martin said. \"He's an MVP. Obviously you want that guy playing.\"\nThe Rangers also lost their third baseman, Adrian Beltre, to a strained lower back. He left after hitting an RBI single in the third.\nRangers manager Jeff Banister said he wasn't sure whether Beltre would be available for Game 2. In an effort to stay in the game, Beltre had a cortisone shot after he was injured sliding into second base in the first.\n\"Obviously we want Adrian in there,\" Banister said. \"He's the heart and soul of this ballclub.\"\nTexas will have Joey Gallo and Ed Lucas travel from its Arizona Fall League team in case Beltre needs to be removed from the roster, a decision that also would rule Beltre out of the AL Championship Series.\nBlue Jays outfielder Jose Bautista hit a solo homer in the sixth, then left with a sore right hamstring after popping out in the eighth. The Blue Jays said Bautista is expected to play Friday.\nPitching on 11 days' rest, Price (0-1) allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He dropped to 1-6 with a 4.79 ERA in 11 postseason games, and is 0-6 in six playoff starts.\n\"I expect to have better results,\" a subdued Price said.\nPrice hit Odor with pitches in consecutive plate appearances in the third and fifth, and the Rangers second baseman came around to score both times, the second time on Chirinos' homer.\n\"I think he relaxed a little bit with the people at the bottom of the lineup,\" Chirinos said.\nPrice hit just three batters in the regular season, none after Toronto obtained him from Detroit on July 30th.\nYovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings, improving to 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against Toronto.\n\"We got in some good hitter's counts and he wouldn't give in,\" Martin said. \"He didn't make those mistakes that we capitalize on.\"\nKeone Kela, Jake Diekman and Sam Dyson finished, with Dyson getting a save.\nAlthough they didn't deliver a win for a rowdy sellout crowd of 49, 834, the Blue Jays weren't feeling down.\n\"I'm over it,\" Martin said. \"I'm ready to go tomorrow. I'm not a big believer in carrying over to the next day. It's a completely brand new ballgame. I like our offense, I like our defense, I like our pitching, I like our chances.\"\nBautista said the Game 1 defeat \"doesn't make a difference\" in his approach.\n\"We've still got to go out there tomorrow and keep winning games and we have to go to Texas anyway and win there,\" he said.\nHaving Marcus Stroman ready to start Game 2 is a plus for the Blue Jays. The right-hander returned from a torn left knee ligament to go 4-0 with a 1.67 ERA in four September starts.\n\"You always look forward to the day that Stro is pitching,\" Gibbons said.\nThe Rangers will turn to left-hander Cole Hamels in Game 2. They won each of the past 10 games he's started.\n\"We're facing their ace,\" Gibbons said. \"That definitely won't be easy.\"\nCito Gaston, who managed the Blue Jays to back-to-back World Series titles in 1992 and 1993, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to veteran left-hander Mark Buehrle, who is not on Toronto's playoff roster.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
