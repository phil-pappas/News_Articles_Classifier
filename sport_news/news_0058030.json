In his place, municipal engineer has been given the charge. Sources said as per rules of the Town and Country Planning Department, only a law graduate should be posted as Executive Officer. However, it was surprising that an engineer has been given the charge. The transfer move has come as a surprise for many as the officer had been under rigorous training for the past three months for chalking out plan for developing Dharamsala a Smart City. He was in Shimla or Delhi attending conferences and holding meetings with consultants. The civic body has to submit its plan for second round of the Smart City competition by December. The transferred EO was also part of inquiry being conducted on the directions of the High Court regarding the alleged illegal felling of trees in McLeodganj. He was part of the team constituted by the Deputy Commissioner, Kangra, on the directions of the court, to probe the charges of the illegal felling of trees. The EO was ready to establish task teams to take action against the violators. The sources said the EO had antagonised a strong lobby of contractors by delaying their payments. The payments were delayed for “anomalies” in works. The municipal engineer assumed the charge today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:04:38.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
