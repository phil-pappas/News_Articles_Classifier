Most of that oil is not locally produced, but one company is trying to change that.\nOn a crisp fall day harvesting is in full effect at Roorda's Farm in Addison.\nOn this day the crop was sunflowers. The field may look past its prime, but it's just how Nekata White wants it with the seeds dried out.\nHe cold presses them in Middlebury to make edible oil for his business Full Sun Company.\n\"It's an oil with flavor much like olive oil is,\" said White.\nAlong with sunflower oil, Full Sun Company also presses canola seeds into oil.\n\"We don't use chemicals to extract the oils which most oils on the shelf are chemically extracted,\" said White.\nTypically bland cold pressing the seeds makes sunflower and canola oil burst with flavor.\nWhite says the two oils are ideal for making salad dressing and finishing meals like you would with olive oil or sauteing your favorite foods.\n\"It holds the flavor and color and aroma and makes these kinds of oils a rich culinary experience,\" said White.\nCurrently the company gets about 3 percent of its crop from Vermont. The rest comes from places like Minnesota and Canada. But that's going to change. It's recruiting farmers locally. In the next three years it hopes to cultivate at least half of its seeds from around the Green Mountains.\n\"The 25 ton truck loads we bring in, each of those tons makes around 90 to 100 gallons so a full ton will make almost two full 55 gallon drums,\" said White.\nReporter Gina Bullard: Wow, there is a lot of flavor.\nWhite: There's a little spice to it.\nBullard: i never knew oil could taste so different, that's really good too!\nDiscovering oil grown close to home that's Made in Vermont.\nFull Sun Company's oils are sold at 30 stores around the state and in Boston and New York City. It costs about $7 a bottle. They hope to press hemp oil soon.", "external_links": ["http://www.fullsuncompany.com/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:23:14.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
