The Jets have a PDO (shooting percentage plus save percentage) of 1.049, which is fourth in the entire NHL. They've also given up the fourth most shots in the league, including more than 40 in three games, all against upper echelon teams, and are in the bottom half of the league in analytic formulas for possession.\nAsk a Jets player or coach about these analytics and you will surely get a brush-off answer, but ask them about the team's defensive play so far and you know you've hit a topic that is being addressed in the dressing room.\nThe Jets were 10th in the NHL last season in goals against, a standing they were both proud of and wanted to improve upon. Giving up 40 shots a game and expecting the goaltenders to bail them out was not part of the plan.\n\"We think we can be a better defensive team and we think our goaltenders have been very good in keeping the number where it's at,\" Jets coach Paul Maurice said after a high-tempo practice at the IcePlex.\n\"It's an area that we want to maintain. We finished 10th in goals against last season and I believe we're sitting 11th right now, so we're not far off it. We've added different players who have a bit more of an offensive talent to their game and we've added things to our game in more of an offensive mindset. So what we're trying to do is make sure that balance is still there.\"\nGoaltenders Ondrej Pavelec and Michael Hutchinson have been very strong in the early going. Pavelec is 2-2 with a 2.52 GAA and .926 save percentage, while Hutchinson is 2-0 with a gaudy 1.00 GAA and .968 save percentage.\nThose save percentage numbers are not likely sustainable but the goalies certainly could be helped out more by the rest of the team. Pavelec had his best season last year at least in part due to the team's ability to play clampdown defence.\nWhile the Jets have been solid defensively for the most part in games against Boston, New Jersey and Calgary, that was not the case against strong playoff contenders New York Islanders, Rangers and St. Louis Blues.\n\"We've had three games where we don't like our shots against and three games that we're really pleased with,\" Maurice said. \"(Defence) is the foundation of what we do and we want to make sure that when we're in a stretch of playoff teams that we're in now, that we can start limiting some of them and keep them off the big numbers.\"\nA couple more tests will come this weekend when the Jets host the Stanley Cup finalist Tampa Bay Lightning and division rival Minnesota Wild. The team was hoping three days of practice before Friday's game at MTS Centre will help them get back to the defensive structure they executed so well last season.\n\"It's been OK but definitely there are some things we need to improve on,\" Jets defenceman Mark Stuart said. \"We want to be in the top of the league in defence and right now we're not quite there. It's something we need to concentrate on.\"\nAs for the 40-plus shot games by the opposition?\n\"That's a lot of positional things and things that we can rectify,\" Stuart said. \"It doesn't worry me but it's not something you want to be giving your goalie -- that much work -- every game. It's something that we can get a lot better at with a few tweaks here and there.\"\nIt would be a stretch to suggest the Jets haven't been as good as their record so far. They worked hard for their wins and beat three teams they were supposed to beat, along with a very good Rangers squad on the road.\nLong term, however, there are some red flags.\nIf some of these trends keep up, the good results will be much more difficult to come by.\nDefensive game not where Winnipeg Jets want it to be in early going\nBy Ted Wyman , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 04:10 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 10:37 PM EDT\nThere are some analytics out there that suggest the Winnipeg Jets have been more lucky than good so far this season while getting off to a 4-2 start.\nThe theory goes that the Jets have inflated shooting and save percentages which are unsustainable, especially since they've given up considerably more shots and shot attempts than they've taken this season.\nThere is some truth in the numbers.
