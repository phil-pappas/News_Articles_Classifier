Of all the threats lurking on the Silverado course, the site of this past week’s Frys.com Open, perhaps none pose a greater hazard to Lyle than his caddie’s sore throat.\n“I was worried that I’d get him sick,” Lyle’s caddie, Darren Woolard, said.\nIt was a valid concern. Lyle, 34, underwent a double umbilical cord blood transplant in 2012 after his second bout with acute myeloid leukemia. He returned to competition in late 2013 and tried to resume a full schedule last year, starting at this event. After 10 starts, and three made cuts, Lyle took a hiatus and returned to his native Australia, citing mental, physical and emotional exhaustion.\n Related Coverage On Golf: Relentless Schedule Chips Away at Rory McIlroy’s Drive to Improve OCT. 15, 2015 He resurfaced last week, at the site of his tie for 31st in 2014. After opening with a three-under-par 69, Lyle posted a 77 on Friday, missing the cut. Lyle, who is playing on a major medical exemption, has nine more starts, during which he must earn at least $217,679, to secure his exempt status for the 2015-16 season.\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\n“Through this whole thing, I said if I never play golf again, I’ll be happy,” said Lyle, a two-time winner on the Web.com Tour. “I could walk away from the game and be reasonably happy with what I’ve accomplished.”\nRobert Allenby, one of Lyle’s closest friends, described Lyle’s return to the tour as “a miracle in itself.”\n“I don’t think people really realize what he’s gone through,” said Allenby, who kept in touch with Lyle throughout his most recent ordeal. “The only people who could probably fathom it are people who have gone through it themselves, and probably half of them haven’t survived.”\nOn Golf An occasional column looking at the news, issues and personalities of golf.
