But no Charlotte NBA team has ever won six preseason games and the Hornets enter Monday’s game at 5-0. NOTABLE: Cody Zeller hit the first 15 shots of the preseason and is currently 16 of 18 (88.9 percent) from the field in five preseason games…. Due primarily to liberal substitution patterns, Charlotte has five players averaging in double figures in scoring, led by Jeremy Lin (14.0 average)…. Clifford admitted Saturday after the win over New York that his 15 th roster spot is likely a decision between keeping rookie Aaron Harrison or veterans Damien Wilkins or Elliot Williams. He also said it shows how “far reaching” the impact of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist’s season-ending shoulder injury…. Charlotte’s regular season opener is Oct. 28 at Miami at 7:30 p.m. The Hornets’ home opener is Nov. 1 against Atlanta at 2 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:47:01.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
