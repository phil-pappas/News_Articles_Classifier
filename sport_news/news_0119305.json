Lions, Winnipeg Blue Bombers or Montreal Alouettes is going to make the playoffs, even though it probably shouldn't. The three teams have been able to muster only five wins thus far, and the prospects of more victories don't look good.\nThe three teams don't play each other down the stretch, which means there's still a chance someone with five wins could make the playoffs. That has happened a few times before in the Crazy Football League, but never in the crossover era.\nThe crossover was incorporated in the mid-1990s to prevent bad teams from making the playoffs, and it has, for the most part, worked. The team with the worst record to make the playoffs since the crossover was created 20 years ago was the 1999 Edmonton Eskimos, who squeaked in with a 6-12 record because the team trying to cross over from the East, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, also ended up with a 6-12 mark.\nThe worst crossover team was the Eskimos in 2012, when they got in with a 7-11 mark but were pasted by the Argos in the East semifinal.\nA look at the worst teams to make the playoffs in the last 40 years:\n* Ottawa Rough Riders (1994) – They finished fourth in the East Division with a 4-14 mark but got into the post-season because it was the first year of U.S. expansion and eight teams qualified.\n* Ottawa Rough Riders (1993) – This squad also got into the playoff party with a 4-14 record, but that was thanks to the 3-15 Argonauts and no crossover rule. Saskatchewan, which placed fourth in the West, failed to qualify despite a 10-8 regular season.\n* Hamilton Tiger-Cats (1983) – Their 5-10-1 record was good enough for a playoff berth, and they even upset the 8-8 Rough Riders in the East semifinal.\n* Ottawa Rough Riders (1982) – The Montreal Concordes sputtered to a 2-14 campaign, so that meant Ottawa got in with a 5-11 record. They, too, won the East semifinal.\n* Ottawa Rough Riders (1981) – Tony Gabriel and Co. actually placed second in the East at 5-11, and they nearly won the Grey Cup, falling 26-23 to Warren Moon and the Eskimos.\n* Montreal Alouettes (1981) – The reason the Rough Riders finished second was because these guys placed third at 3-13, ahead of the 2-14 Argos. The Stampeders finished last in the West but would have been second in the East at 6-10.\nSUPREME LEADER\nJohn Hufnagel became the second fastest coach to reach 100 victories in CFL history, accomplishing the feat in just 142 games.\nHufnagel, who is in his final season as head coach and will be strictly the GM next season, has arguably the best talent with which to work in Cowtown, but the man seems to command respect from his players like no other. He rides perfectly the line between fear and support, and he expects nothing but the best from his troops.\nNever was that more evident than last month after the Stamps beat B.C. at McMahon Stadium. His players hadn't even got their equipment off when Hufnagel was reminding them they needed to be better than what they had just produced against the Lions.\nIt was an excellent glimpse into what makes Hufnagel a great coach.\nPASS THE TORCH\nIf Ricky Ray hasn't been ready by now, there's no point throwing him in the fire.\nArgos quarterback Trevor Harris didn't look too hot against the Stampeders on Saturday, but it was one game. Toronto is Harris' team now.\nIn fact, he gives the Boatmen the best chance to win, as he is 9-6 this season as Toronto's starter. Since Ray arrived four years ago he is only 20-21 as a regular season starter and has missed a whopping 27 games due to injury.\nRay, who turns 36 this week, got the Argos a Grey Cup in 2012, but the numbers suggest it's time for them to move on with Harris as the man.\nHarris doesn't deserve to be the league's highest paid quarterback, which last week the Toronto Sun's Frank Zicarelli reported he wants to be, but general manager Jim Barker needs to give him starter's money, because that's what he is and should be going forward.\nPlaying Ray at this point could be a risky proposition. There's no need to alienate a top three free agent like Harris.\nLATE HITS\nThe prediction of the week goes to RedBlacks cornerback Jovon Johnson, who, still bitter about a voice mail message telling him his time with the Bombers was over, informed the Ottawa Sun's Tim Baines he was going to make Winnipeg's lives a “living hell” last Friday night. He more than delivered, intercepting two passes and making the tackle on a turnover on downs ... Word out of Hamilton on Tuesday was running back C.J. Gable, who has missed the last 10 games and 13 of 15 overall due to injury, should be back in the lineup on Friday night when the Ticats visit the B.C. Lions ... Alouettes defensive lineman Aaron Lavarias on Monday had season-ending surgery on a broken leg he suffered against the Ticats.\nTHE INSIDERS SAY\nCFL coaches and managers give their anonymous thoughts on what they’re talking about behind closed doors:\nMy coaches told me that Wade Miller has already talked to a guy about being an assistant coach next year for the Bombers. One, it's not his job to do that. Two, how can any organization be successful when that bull(bleep) is going on during the season? ... That young guy (Greg) Ellingson is better than I thought. Would love to have him line up for me. You can tell (Henry) Burris has confidence he's going to catch everything ... If I needed to hire a head coach, I would steal (Orlondo) Steinauer from the Ticats. When I look at the other clubs, I think he's the best young coach in our league ... We can all see that Saskatchewan is thinking next year with their trades for young players and draft picks. But (Jerome) Messam is going to help Calgary a lot. Wish they had traded him to the East instead of our division ... If I was Jeff Tedford I'd go with (Travis) Lulay at quarterback. He's more experienced and if healthy he's the better option ... I would love to see them beat Calgary, but if Mike Reilly keeps turning the ball over like he is (seven interceptions in the past three games) the Eskimos won't get to the Grey Cup ... That was a tough transition for Kevin Glenn on Sunday. He definitely gives Montreal a chance. He's better than his first game showed ... Trevor Harris wants to be the highest paid quarterback in the league? That's just negotiating tactics. He's not even best quarterback in the East ... (Brad) Sinopoli has definitely improved the RedBlacks receiving group. (Maurice) Price and (Chris) Williams have their moments. They're not best group in CFL, though. Calgary's is better by far ... I've never coached where he's been, but the media needs to give more credit to Marcel Desjardins. All we hear about is Rick Campbell, Jason Maas and Henry Burris, but their GM, Desjardins, has given them the players to win in Ottawa ... We need B.C. to beat Hamilton, so I hope they blitz the (bleep) out of Jeff Mathews on Friday night ... Not surprised to see (John) Hufnagel get to 100 wins as quickly as he did. He has had a consistent staff for the most part, but he always had a good, solid quarterback plan and they draft well ... The Eskimos don't need to be concerned about not being about to put away the lesser teams with more ease. There isn't a dominant team this year, so not a worry.\nBOSS BLUNDER\nThis one goes to whoever made the decision to stiff the Argos.\nEven though there is a paragraph on Rogers Centre's own website that says it takes about 30 hours to transform the park between football and baseball, officials told the Argos five days between potential Jays playoff games wasn't enough to squeeze in a football game at the downtown Toronto stadium this weekend.\nSo the Argos, who played in front of 3,401 “home fans” on Saturday at Hamilton's Tim Hortons Field, will play in Steeltown again this weekend when they easily could have played at home.\nThe Argos have enough problems when it comes to attracting fans, but this weekend's second consecutive mess is not their fault.\nWhy couldn't Rogers Centre have thrown the Boatmen a bone?\nSMOOTH MOVE\nAlouettes head coach and GM Jim Popp made the right move last week when he acquired quarterback Kevin Glenn from the Saskatchewan Roughriders.\nThe decision to make the deal was a no-brainer, but those kind of trades don't always get done for some reason. It made perfect sense, and the transaction was completed well before last week's CFL trade deadline.\nGlenn's debut with the Alouettes against the Tiger-Cats wasn't great, but that had to be expected considering he had two practices with his new team and was facing one of the best defences in the league. It also didn't help that his receivers couldn't catch the ball.\nThe Als now have the most experienced quarterback among the three teams fighting for the final playoff spot.\nPENTON’S PREDICTION\nThe Argos are going to finish first in the East Division. The Boatmen have a relatively cushy schedule compared to the Tiger-Cats and RedBlacks, who will face one another twice to close out the season and will likely split as a result. Toronto finishes with Winnipeg, B.C. and Montreal.\nTWEET OF THE WEEK\n“S/O to @cwillkl80 going over 1,000 receiving yards 2night..I'm pretty fast myself but my man Chris got a whole other level of speed.”\n– RedBlacks WR Khalil Paden (@PadenFull13) congratulates teammate Chris Williams on his 1,000 yard season\nBY THE NUMBERS\n20-14 – East Division's record against the West, with six games left\n2004 – Last time the East won the season series against the West\n3-5 – Lions record when leading after third quarter\n71.1 – Percentage of Argos plays that are passes, the most in the CFL\nPOWER RANKINGS\n1.
