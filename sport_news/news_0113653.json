She said it's usually a combination of factors.\n“Economic opportunity is a very critical component to that decision, also the availability of social networks like friends or family,” Whitely Binder explained.\nSeattleites hope city planning can keep up with the influx of people.\n“The systems have to work,” Nicole Swedberg said. “As things get bigger and bigger, we have to change our system(s) so they work. Water, education, whatever those systems are.”\n“On a personal level, I'm more thoughtful about how I go about my day,” added Cheri Herzer, “I kind of schedule my day around the traffic,”\nWhitely Binder said there are implications on our infrastructure and she hopes their findings can help influence public policy.\n“We know that climate change is occurring, and now the question is can we slow that train down and eventually stop it?” Whitely Binder said.\nExperts say even if climate change starts to affect our population growth, we wouldn't see a spike for at least a few decades", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:18:06.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
