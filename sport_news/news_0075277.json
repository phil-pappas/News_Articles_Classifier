The Equato Guineans are no doubt a good side and have a lot of energy and pace, but our game plan on Sunday will be completely different as we intend to win and win good,” Coach Dramani told The Mirror Sports. \nFor the Malabo game, he rested most of his key players, but most of those players are likely to be on duty with starting roles. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
