Comment Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 11:29 PM Updated Oct 23, 2015 at 11:47 PM By Chris Zadorozny Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 11:29 PM Updated Oct 23, 2015 at 11:47 PM LAKE ODESSA - Ionia and Lakewood, the rivalry that’s known throughout Ionia County. It crosses M-66, into Barry County. Neither team nor student section like each other. It’s a classic. And just like the rivalry battle line crossover, it was the Bulldogs who crossed over into Lakewood territory, caravan and all and brought home the Ionia County National Bank trophy with a 27-7 win over the host Vikings. “We knew all season the teams that we’ve played are pretty dang tough,” said Ionia head coach Mike Holes. “We had some good competition all season. We felt our guys were real tough in the box and that we felt like we could eliminate their run game.” Other than one big play in the early stages of the first quarter, the Bulldogs (3-6) defense shut down a high-powered run-heavy Viking (7-2) offense. “We though our guys were tougher inside than theirs and I think we kind of showed it tonight,” said Holes. Both teams first drives of the game didn’t go very well. Lakewood ended up punting after three plays and Ionia, pulled a gutsy call early on fourth down. At the Lakewood 36-yard line just four minutes into the game, Ionia decided to keep the ball on 4th down and 12. Lakewood’s Dane Stambaugh burst through the Bulldog front five and sacked Ionia senior quarterback Mitchell Lahr. The Vikings used that big play to their advantage. One play later, junior running back Noah Caudy found a seam and cut down the left side of the field for a 55-yard touchdown run. Just like that, Lakewood took a 7-0 lead with 7:36 to play in the first quarter over Ionia and the No. 7 ranked Vikings in Division 4 looked like they were off to a great start. They stopped Ionia on their next drive but it was their offense that couldn’t get going after that big play. Ionia tied up the game with 25.1 left in the first quarter. With their drive starting near midfield, Lahr would end up in the end zone on a 21-yard run just four plays later. Defenses stood tall for both sides in the first half of the second quarter, but a key fumble on second down for Lakewood gave Ionia the ball back in enemy territory. Three plays later, junior running back Andrew Fox found a seam to the right side for a three-yard touchdown run and a 14-7 lead with 4:39 left in the first half. Ionia then ended the first half with the ball, just missing out on a near touchdown reception as a 39-yard pass went through the hands of senior wide receiver Josh Magley. They did get the ball to start the second half and they made this one count. On 4th and 6 from the Lakewood 10-yard line, Lahr found Magley, who escaped double coverage just inside the right side of the end zone. Ionia took a 21-7 lead with 3:29 to play in the third quarter. Page 2 of 2 - Lakewood was determined to make a comeback like last week, but this time, make it a win instead of a loss. They had their chance, but a no-call on an obvious passed interference call in the early stages of the fourth quarter. On 3rd and 13 from the Ionia 36-yard line would’ve given Lakewood a first down. Instead, Ionia got the ball back on a shanked punt on the following play. They drove right down the field and Fox secured the victory with 6:39 to play, a nine-yard run right up the middle with a juke here and there. A failed two-point conversion gave Ionia a 27-7 lead and eventual final score. “They were making a lot of big holes, getting me in open field so I can make cuts and make (Lakewood) miss,” said Fox of his offensive line. “It feels great to get the win for the seniors especially. I basically just played my heart out, ran my hardest for them and made sure to get the win.” “They kept the ball away from us, they were able to move the ball on the ground, they were bigger than us and they just kept attacking our d-end and they were pretty good at it,” said Lakewood head coach Nick Boucher. “We couldn’t slow them down, they got us off-balance and our guys never really recovered.” Although Boucher said the loss will sting, the Vikings still have a lot of work to do, as they’ll head to the playoffs and find out their opponent on Sunday night. “I’ll just let this one sting for tonight, tomorrow we’ll get to work, we’ll be on this film, fixing mistakes, fixing errors. Sunday night, we’ll be up late, preparing for next week.” Ionia ends the season on a high note, which Holes noted, not many teams get to do. “If you make the playoffs, there’s only eight of them that will end on a win. Usually you don’t make the playoffs, you lose at the end of the season. This is great to send our seniors out with a victory.” Follow Sports Editor Chris Zadorozny on Twitter @ZadsISS.
