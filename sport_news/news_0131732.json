My guys did a nice job in the second half of getting in front of him and making him earn every yard.” \nThe Green Hornets had a hard time moving the ball without Boney picking up yards in the second half. Quarterback Derek Sheaffer was 5-for-19 passing for 89 yards against the Liberty secondary. \nAs a team, Emmaus ran 20 offensive plays in the second half for 86 yards. \n“We executed toward the end of the game,” junior defensive end Jaohne Duggan said. “We came out and it was kind of bad, letting them run all over us. Toward the end of the game, though, the defensive line stepped it up.” Brian Derkacs (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \nDuggan and Brian Derkacs came through with sacks on Sheaffer while Chance Neilley recorded an interception. \nAs for slowing down the physical Boney, Duggan said it came down to not letting him get to the outside. \n“We just had to keep him inside, keep him contained,” Duggan said. “If he would get outside, get free, we had to get a lot of bodies on him. We had to get together and hit him as a team. … He’s a big back, so it’s pretty difficult to bring him down. But once you get to him, hit him, get a couple bodies on him and he’s gonna go down.” \nThe defensive line clogged up the middle and when Emmaus tried to run Boney to the outside – he got his yards that way in the first half with good speed for his 6-foot-2, 222-pound frame – the Hurricanes were there, too. \nNeither team had gone up by two possessions until the second half when the Liberty defense held the Green Hornets in check, making them turn the ball over on downs and punt it away on back-to-back series. \nThat allowed the Hurricanes to take a 34-24 lead, which became 34-31 when Sheaffer found Stephen Wolf for a long pass and set up Boney’s 10-yard score in the fourth quarter. \nEmmaus even got the ball back on its own 36 with 2:01 left in the game, but the Liberty defense played big again, allowing 11 yards on six plays. The Green Hornets were forced to huddle in the process, ticking the clock down until it was over, the Hurricanes getting out with a win. \n“We come out every week and play as one (defensive line),” Duggan said. “Up front is where it starts and we finished the game out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:52:38.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
