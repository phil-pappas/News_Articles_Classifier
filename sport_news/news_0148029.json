He asked about the Blue Jays, whose matinee playoff game was unfolding on the dressing room television, and he asked about the traffic back in Toronto.\n“Are they still doing the Gardiner?” he asked. “What’s the deal there? Are they going to tear it down?”\nThe 28-year-old defenceman spent the first five seasons of his NHL career with the Maple Leafs, and had thus become acquainted with the notion of things being torn down in Toronto. In many ways, the hockey franchise is defined by its failure to win a Stanley Cup since 1967, which is the longest active drought in the league.\nWhat is sometimes forgotten, though, is that Toronto is merely tied for the longest drought. The Blues have not won the NHL title since joining the league in 1967, but Gunnarsson, who was shipped to St. Louis in a trade last year , said history does not burden his new team as readily as it did his old team.\n“If you’re coming into the club, you can’t really take that burden — that’s a tough one, since ‘67,” he said “But that’s the way it is, right? It’s the culture, it’s the fans, it’s everything around it. It’s tough to escape it.”\nAnd in St. Louis?\n“I don’t think anyone feels like that,” Gunnarsson said. “It’s different, even though it’s the same year.”\nThe NHL doubled in size with expansion in 1967, adding six new teams. The Minnesota North Stars, Philadelphia Flyers, California Seals, Los Angeles Kings and Pittsburgh Penguins joined the Blues.\nThe Flyers were the first expansion team to win the Stanley Cup, in 1974, followed by the Penguins (1991), the North Stars (in 1999, after merging with the Seals and moving to Dallas) and the Kings (2012).\nThe Blues have made three appearances in the finals, but none since 1970.\nForward Alexander Steen is in his eighth season with the Blues, but was once a prospect in Toronto, having been taken 24th overall in the 2002 draft. He used to live in Woodbridge.\n“Both places are extremely passionate about their teams,” he said, “but it’s a different feel or vibe here, I guess you would say”\nThere is not as much media coverage of the Blues, he said, but there is also a different feeling players get from being out in public.\n“I honestly don’t even know how to explain it,” Steen said. “It’s not the same hysteria, I guess. You almost have a small town feel here, even though it’s a big city.”\n“There’s frustration,” said Blues coach Ken Hitchcock, “but I think the frustration is lost windows of opportunity.”\nThe Blues finished first in the Central Division last year with a 109-point regular season, but they fell in six games to the Minnesota Wild in the first round of the playoffs . It was the team’s second straight first-round exit.\nSt. Louis opened the new season with a 3-1 win at home over the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday night, holding heralded rookie Connor McDavid without a point in his NHL debut . Around the city the next morning, most of the attention had shifted back to the baseball playoffs.\n“In Toronto, it was always like, ‘Alright, how do we get to the playoffs?’” Gunnarsson said. “This team has that kind of confidence that, ‘if we play our way, we know that we’ve got a good enough team to always be in the playoffs.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:18:28.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
