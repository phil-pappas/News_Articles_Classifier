The award is presented to the Rutgers commit who puts forth the top on-field performance throughout the previous weekend . Productivity, game magnitude, overall impact, versatility, strength of opponent and whether the committed player's team wins the game or not, will factor in as criteria for the award.\nThis week's award goes to Mohamed Jabbie , who set the tone for South Brunswick against Old Bridge Friday night, as he opened the game with a 78-yard punt return touchdown.\n\"It was off the bounce, I picked it up. I saw I had to make one man miss and I made him miss,\" said Jabbie, the 6-foot, 175-pounder. \"And I went sideways towards all the blockers on the left side. And I just let my blockers do the rest of the job and took it to the house.\"\nRELATED: Rutgers football commitment performance recap, weekend of 9/25 The Vikings have always been a run-oriented team, as they utilize their speed to win the numbers match-up at the point of attack and get outside.\nBut things have changed this season as the team has made more of a commitment to passing the football.\n\"We are not just a straight run team now,\" Jabbie said. \"We can run and pass. It's great for our offense to be able to do both things.\"\nJabbie is more than please with his expanded role as a senior.\n\"It's great because I get to get the ball more, I get to make more plays,\" said Jabbie. \"And I just feel like I can make more plays for my team, lead us to victory every time.\n\"I love getting the ball in my hands so I can make things happen.\"\nJabbie, who also caught four passes, accumulated 127 all-purpose yards en route to his team's 20-9 victory.\nRunner-up: Sr. Wallenpaupack (Pa.) LB Rashawn Battle generated 85 rushing yards and two TDs on 21 carries, four tackles and a pass deflection in a 35-34 win over Valley View (Archbald, Pa.).\nTodderick Hunt may be reached at thunt@njadvancemedia.com .
