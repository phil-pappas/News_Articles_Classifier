We've been through this. I mean, it's hard to win on the road. I've got to give Tech credit. I've got to give their offense, what they did. They kept battling back. I told the announcers before the ballgame on Friday night, I said, it's probably who's going to have the ball last. I knew we were down pass rushers and I knew you had to rush the passer to be able to do it, and we hurt ourselves. We did some things, we gave up probably three touchdowns just on missed assignments. But you've got to give Tech credit and our offense. But you can't have a field goal blocked and you can't miss one. You can have a that game out of reach, and you don't have to be in that situation.\nThere's some things we need to learn out of it. You've got Texas up next at home. I told my team back in January, well, whenever this came out, the four most important ballgames in our season was this four-game swing. It was at Tech, home at Texas and then Kansas State, then Iowa State, because then you get about a week and a half to get ready for a Thursday night game.\nI didn't expect anything different. Obviously I'd rather not have given up that many points, but like I said last week, if our job on defense this year is to hold them to one less, than that's what we do. All we care about is every week we move forward and we win a ballgame, but you've got to give Coach Kingsbury, that's a lot different football team than I saw a year ago. Played all the way to the end, and you know, they about didn't come up short.\nOn Trevone Boykin during the game-winning drive:\nI've got to give this group credit. I mean, they just keep finding a way to win because most people would say, you know, you weren't supposed to. We were down -- we were down basically nine starters on defense, and that's not counting the guys that graduated a year ago, so nine starters this year, three senior pass rushers, and we've got Michael Mosharrafa playing in the game, which he's never played in a game before in his life. You've got guys rushing the passer, and we found a way to win. A couple freshman linebackers, Travin Howard got burned a couple times, but to be honest with you we asked him to do a lot, and he learned from the experience, and he'll get better next time, and it's going to be -- I don't expect much week to be much different to be honest with you.\nOn Aaron Green's catch:\nThank goodness. I don't know where he came from, but thank goodness.\nOn Texas Tech's last-ditch effort to score at the end of the game:\nYeah, when I saw the offensive line, I was like, you've got to be kidding me, and then he flips it to No. 11, and you can't hardly tackle him in a phone booth. So we've got guys running all over the place, thinking how is one guy going to get him on the ground. Til we saw the final one -- now, a younger Gary Patterson would be mad because we gave up about 70 more points of total yardage. The older Gary Patterson is just glad we won by three points.\nTREVONE BOYKIN\nOn what he'd call that last play to Green:\nPray. Pray Hail Mary. I don't know, that's just something you don't write down. Sometimes you just need a little luck in this game, and we pulled through.\nOn if he thought the game would be decided on the last team with the ball:\nYeah, Coach P told us before the game started that it could possibly come down to the last play, and on this crazy day, it did. It's just something that you really can't predict the future, but that's why he's our head coach.\nOn the next-man up philosophy:\nIt really just brings us tighter together. It's like the next man up. One guy goes down, the other just has to step up. We're not asking them to jump over a building, we're not asking them to do anything impossible really, just really just go out there and make routine reads, communicate, be you. You don't have to be bigger than yourself, just go out and try and make plays.\nAARON GREEN\nOn the play where he caught the ball:\nWell, you know, Coach Luper, Coach Cumbie and Coach Meacham, they always preach follow the ball. Whoever has the ball, follow it, because you never know like when the ball, somebody may fumble or anything like that. I knew there was a chance, Josh Doctson pretty much catches everything, but there was a chance I knew he might not have caught it because it was a little high and a guy was behind him, so I did what I was told and I followed the ball, and I saw it the whole way, and I caught it.\nOn what the team's demeanor was at the start of the game-winning drive:\nIt's very calm. We have the best player in college football in the huddle, and we have the best wide receiver in college football, so I mean, not too much can go wrong with that. We just believed in each other. We're brothers. We've been through a lot. We've been through terrible seasons. We've been through good season. You know, we've prevailed. That's what we do. That's TCU football.\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-09-27T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:33:58.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
