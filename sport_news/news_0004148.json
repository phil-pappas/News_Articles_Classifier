(FILE PHOTO) \nJerry Chudley climbed to the top of the Westman Super League of Curling last season. Now he has to try to stay on top of the mountain. \nChudley and his Neepawa curling team of Kevin Cooley, Brent McKee and Paul Robertson dethroned four-time reigning champion Terry McNamee in last year’s final to win their first-ever title. All four players are back to defend their title and are looking forward to the new season beginning next Wednesday at the Brandon Curling Club. \n\"I think everybody is feeling pretty good,\" said the 42-year-old Chudley. \"I think we should do all right. Hopefully things start off good. I haven’t curled in a while so obviously that’s going to be huge to get that first game under the belt and keep going.\" \nChudley’s team has set two major goals for the season: To win the Super League again and get back to the Safeway Championship. Chudley has qualified for the provincial men’s event three of the last four years. He struggled at the event last year, going two-and-out in the double-elimination bonspiel, but he has reached \nA-side and B-side qualifiers in the past. \nAlthough the foursome is focused on getting to provincials, it will try to go about it by entering berth bonspiels and playdowns as opposed to going through the Manitoba Curling Tour. \n\"We don’t do it as much as (Kelly) Marnoch and some of the other guys,\" Chudley said. \"It’s just tough for us with work schedules and kids and everything. I’d like to do more.\" \nOnce again, the Westman league will feature 12 teams. Kortney Teale’s and Jim Renwick’s squads will not be back. Butch Mouck has entered a team this season, while Steve Irwin has split with Terry McNamee and will skip his own squad in the circuit. \nIrwin took Travis Taylor and Travis Saban with him and added Cody Rabe to the lineup. McNamee’s new Super League team includes Brendan Taylor, Geordie Hargreaves and Travis Gouldie. \nEven though one of the most dominant teams in the league’s history has split up, Chudley expects it to be a grind to get back to the playoffs and the final. \n\"I think it will be tough. When those two guys curl together, obviously they were very good,\" he said. \"Now they’re split up and I’m going to predict they’ll both be pretty solid. \n\"There’s definitely some other teams in there that are tough like Curtis McCannell, Kelly Marnoch and Duane Lang. They’re always tough. It’s going to be tough slugging this year for sure.\" \nThe round robin runs through Dec. 16, with the playoffs set for Jan. 24. \nEXTRA ENDS: Both the Brandon and Riverview Curling Clubs begin league play on Monday.
