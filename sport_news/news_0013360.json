Below is the statement that was issued on the department's Facebook page. \n\"At approximately 3:15 pm on October 13, 2015, a call came into the Nye County Dispatch Center from Richard Hunter, Media Director for Dennis Hof's Bunny Ranch, requesting an ambulance for an unresponsive male experiencing a medical emergency at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada, approximately twenty miles north of Pahrump, Nevada in Nye County. \n\"An ambulance from Pahrump Valley Fire and Rescue Service arrived at 3:34 pm and the patient, identified as Lamar Odom was stabilized and transported to Desert View Hospital arriving at 4:16 pm. Nye County Sheriff's Office Detectives Cory Fowles and Michael Eisenloffel arrived and conducted an investigation on scene. \n\"After being treated by the physicians, arrangements were made to transport him by Mercy Air helicopter. However, Mr. Odom was unable to be transported by air due to his stature. He was immediately transported by Pahrump Valley Fire and Rescue Ambulance to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada for further treatment.\" Prayers go out to Lamar Odom and his family please God anything u can do to help him thru thisüôè ‚Äî Paul Pierce (@paulpierce34) October 14, 2015 \nOdom was arrested by the California Highway Patrol in August of 2013 on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and or drugs, according to the incident report. That happened after weeks of speculation about his well-being. \nOdom was taken fourth overall by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 1999 draft. He signed as a free agent with the Miami Heat in 2003 and was traded after that season to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a package team for Shaquille O'Neal. He was with the Lakers until after the 2011 season, the season he was named Sixth Man of the Year. The Lakers won NBA titles in 2009 and 10. \nIn December of 2011, Odom was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, after a proposed deal that would have sent him to the New Orleans Hornets as part of a package for point guard Chris Paul was nixed by then-commissioner David Stern. The stint with the Mavericks was rocky, Odom spent some time in the DLeague in March. After the season, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers. \nHe became a free agent after his last year with the Clippers, but wasn't signed by an NBA team. He then spent some time in the Spanish League in the spring of 2014 before signing with the New York Knicks in April. After that season, he was waived by New York, ending his pro career. \nSam Amick and Jeff Zillgitt contributed to this report. Our thoughts and prayers are with Lamar Odom and his family at this time. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wvec.com/1LtF6C3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:44:53.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
