Star running back LeSean McCoy, who makes $16 million this season, is working his way back from a hamstring injury. Second-year receiver Sammy Watkins, who was drafted No. 4 overall in the 2014 NFL Draft, has a calf injury. \nThose are just three of the 15 players on the Bills’ injury report heading into their Week 6 game against the 5-0 Cincinnati Bengals. \n“Well here’s what I’ve learned,” offensive coordinator Greg Roman said. “Whatever happens, you try to plan the best ahead of time. Try to lay out the best contingency as you can and whatever happens you just make it work and that’s the bottom line. Nobody cares. That’s the way I look at it. So you find a way and I thought our guys found a way last week, which was awesome to see.” \nThat could prove to be a bit tougher against the Bengals than it was against the Titans, depending on which Bills players are able to suit up. Here’s what to watch for in Week 6. 1. Dalton and Bengals’ aerial attack \nAndy Dalton has done a few things well during the best start to a season in his carer. For starters, he’s getting the ball out of his hands in a hurry (fifth-quickest in the league). He’s also completing a higher percentage of passes more than 20 yards down the field than any other quarterback in the league. This passing offense is all about timing. Even the deep stuff comes out quick because Dalton is getting rid of it at the end of his drop. The Bills have to find a way to disrupt his timing, and the blitz isn’t necessarily the way to do that because he makes quick decisions with the ball. The onus could be on cornerbacks Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby on the outside to slow down the Bengals’ talented receivers. 2. Containing Eifert \nSo far this season, Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert has five touchdowns in five games. He has two multi-touchdown games and has taken full advantage of teams keying on A.J. Green in the passing game. He’s going to give the Bills trouble in the middle of the field, particularly with starting safety Aaron Williams once again sidelined. The Bengals have so many weapons on offense that it’s going to be tough for the Bills to contain all of them. 3. Both defensive lines \nIf this game is going to be won in the trenches, the Bengals likely have the advantage. While this game will feature two of the best defensive lines in football, Cincinnati’s offensive line has a better chance of containing Buffalo’s front four than the Bills’ offensive line has of containing the Bengals’ linemen. Still, the Bills’ front has a chance to make an impact on this game if it is able to disrupt Dalton’s timing in the pocket or slow down the Bengals’ two-headed rushing attack of Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard. The Bills’ rushing attack could again be slow to take off if McCoy can’t play or isn’t 100 percent. If the battle in the trenches decides this game, the Bengals could have the edge. 4. Can Harvin step up? \nWhether Sammy Watkins returns to the lineup or not, Percy Harvin needs to find a way to make more plays than he did in the two games Watkins has spent on the sideline. Against the Titans in Week 5, Harvin didn’t catch a pass and had one carry and lost a yard. Watkins seems intent on returning and he wants more targets. Those would both be positive developments for Harvin and the rest of the Bills’ receivers. When the Bills’ offense was clicking early in the season, the spark Harvin provided on offense was a big reason why. He needs to find a way to get free on Sunday. 5. Discipline \nThe Bills managed to get their penalty problem under control against the Tennessee Titans, but can they keep their emotions in check at Ralph Wilson Stadium? In two road games, the Bills have fewer penalties than they have in any one single home game. While Bills fans have made The Ralph one of the most difficult places to play, the Bills haven’t quite taken advantage. Ryan admitted the crowd has performed better than the team at home, and that needs to change against the Bengals.
