Just maybe pressing, trying to do a little too much.”\nWhile conflicted about the sudden transition into a Blue Jay, admitting that he had been knocked for a loop when Anthopoulos called, Tulowitzki also wanted to prove immediately that he was worth what Toronto had given up in the trade that also brought over LaTroy Hawkins: Jose Reyes — shortstop for shortstop — and three right-handed pitching prospects, including spring training sensation Miguel Castro, the closer in early April until it all went pear-shaped.\nAnd then, just when it appeared Tulowitzki was getting his groove back, came the freakish collision at Yankee Stadium with outfielder Kevin Pillar, whose lantern jaw cracked his teammate’s shoulder blade.\nThat Tulowitzki returned from the injury so quickly remains a medical mystery, though nobody knows how much it’s hurting. There’s a clue in the ice-pack swaddling wrapped around his upper body after every game — like the ice cocoon applied to a starting pitcher’s arm.\n“Obviously with the injury, coming back, it slowed me down a little bit. But right now I feel pretty good at the plate.”\nThat’s the what-have-you-done-for-me-lately question answered.\nMost lately, splitting open Game 5 of the American League Championship Series on Wednesday, Tulowitzki smacked a bases-clearing double into the left-centre gap, turning on a 98 m.p.h. fastball from reliever Kelvin Herrera that brought Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion across the plate as Toronto routed the Royals 7-1, averting elimination, living to see another day. It was the first three-run double in Jays’ playoff history.\n“Just getting RBI situations, my teammates are getting on base, and I came up with some timely hitting. That’s what I credit it to, really, the guys in front of me getting on base.”\nWith opposing pitchers manoeuvering through the minefield of Toronto’s top-bopping order, Tulowitzki has been seeing more tantalizing pitches in the six-hole and taking better swings.\nHis post-season batting average has jumped from .096 in the division series — 0-10 in the first two games, with no walks — to .368 in the pennant series. Just 2-for-21 against Texas, Tulowitzki nevertheless was responsible for the three-run homer that sealed a 5-1 Game 3 win over the Rangers and sent the Jays back to the Lone Star State where . . . you know.\nVersus Kansas City, Tulowitzki’s “timely” hitting, particularly with runners on base — an area where the Jays have been inexplicably wanting in the playoffs — has set a club record for most RBI in a single ALCS series (seven) and he now has 11 RBI in the post-season, closing in on the record 13 set by Paul Molitor in 1993.\nThat’s the clutch Tulowitzki that he’s wanted to show his teammates and all those TULO-TULO-TULO chanting fans at Rogers Centre. It just took longer than he would have preferred, albeit surfacing when most crucial.\n“You always want that. In this game, you want success. The bottom line is I made it a point, since I came over — I just wanted to be involved in a winning culture, a winning ball club. It’s been all that.”\nThe increasing comfort level with his swing was evident during batting practice yesterday, as Anthopoulos looked on, noting the velocity, that loud cracking sound on contact. “The ball is coming off his bat so much better.’’\nHis defence, of course, has remained sterling — this is a two-time Gold Glover and five-time all-star who once turned an unassisted triple play — although his body, all six-foot-three and 215 pounds of it, seems all wrong for the position.\n“That’s what makes me who I am,” he says of his athletic agility, “a big guy but still able to play a demanding position. For a long time there weren’t too many big guys playing shortstop. But thanks to guys like Cal Ripken, Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, they really opened the door to big guys like me playing shortstop.’’\nIt was a loosey-goosey off-day at the park, lots of laughter and silly business, featuring one bizarre episode with Munenori Kawasaki, barely comprehensible in fractured English, attempting to hold a conversation in Spanish. “I want to eat horse!’’ according to one translation courtesy of a Spanish reporter.\n“Everybody was so intense and ready for the game (Wednesday),’’ said Tulowitzki, who went to the World Series in his rookie year, 2007, where the Rockies were swept by Boston. “An off-day just gives you a chance to sit back, enjoy where we’re at and kind of see the big picture, not be so into the moment.\n“That’s kind of nice for a change.”\nMore on thestar.com\nFive keys to a Blue Jays comeback in Kansas City\nIt’s time for Blue Jays’ David Price to show his regular-season form: Arthur", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:01:48.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
