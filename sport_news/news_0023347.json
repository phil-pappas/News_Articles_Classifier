Her fourth single, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" featuring John Legend, just hit the Top 40, and she's recovering from the vocal cord surgery that sidetracked her tour, and co-writing songs for artists such as Rascal Flatts.\nBut here she is on the phone, anyway, for an interview about her new role as cover girl for the fashion brand FullBeauty. The plus-size shopping and lifestyle brand ( www.fullbeauty.com ) enlisted Trainor to star in its first-ever digital ad campaign, #OwnYourCurves, after hearing her first hit single, \"All About That Bass.\"\n\"They loved the message, and they told me what they wanted to do with this campaign, and it was everything that I was trying to say,\" Trainor said, her voice strong with whiskey undertone intact. \"I thought it was a perfect match, so I was excited to partner up with them.\"\nOriginally signed as a songwriter, Trainor didn't intend to become an ambassador of body acceptance, nor did she think she'd be the voice on the radio singing \"All About That Bass.\" She co-wrote the song with producer Kevin Kadish, who had the \"all bass/no treble\" idea, which Trainor then related to the body. Both thought it faced long odds of being recorded by anyone.\n\"While writing the song, I was walking into the studio, and it was a time of Avicii, and I remember thinking, we need something different. And we need something that says something. I'm sick of all these love songs!\"\nShe and Kadish wrote \"All About That Bass\" in about an hour. While shopping it around, she sang it for the head of Epic Records and won herself a recording contract.\n\"It was scary; it was my first record deal ever, and now I'm going out there and saying, 'I'm curvy; get used to it!' That's terrifying â€” even if you have a lot of confidence! But the world was so nice to me, and I appreciated it.\"\nAll about that black dress FullBeauty.com Meghan Trainor's new partnership with FullBeauty.com is an outgrowth of her song \"All About That Bass.\" Meghan Trainor's new partnership with FullBeauty.com is an outgrowth of her song \"All About That Bass.\" (FullBeauty.com) She didn't always have confidence about her curves.\n\"I wrote this to help my confidence,\" she said. \"I wish I was walking around at the time saying, 'I'm all about my bass.' Now, seeing the world react to it and singing along with it, that tells me I did the right thing, and that it's working and hopefully we're spreading the word.\"\nFullBeauty has been around for over a century but is relaunching just as plus-size fashion gathers steam elsewhere. Model Ashley Graham was featured in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue and launched a lingerie line at New York Fashion Week in September. Singer Beth Ditto walked the runway for designer Marc Jacobs, and models Denise Bidot and Sabina Karlsson strutted along with typical-size models at the Chromat show. A \"Project Runway\" contestant debuted a plus-size collection. Melissa McCarthy launched her Melissa McCarthy Seven7 clothing brand with sizes from 4 to 28 and 1X-4X.\nFashion was not one of Trainor's first loves.\n\"Growing up, I never did love fashion and shopping, because I was always bigger than my friends, and it wasn't my favorite thing to go into stores where I couldn't fit in to some of the clothes,\" she said. \"When I found out what FullBeauty was, I thought, that's so cool. That's what I wish I had growing up.\"\nNow being a pop star, she enjoys being fitted by stylists.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5620032b/turbine/ct-cth-meghan-trainor-fullbeauty-image-2-jpg-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e97ec/turbine/sc-fash-1102-meghan-trainor-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:20:32.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
