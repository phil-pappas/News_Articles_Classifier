This puts us in the mix.\" \nZez Steeple also played well for Banks County, totaling over 200 yards, including a 70-yard touchdown run and averaging 40 yards per kickoff return. Meanwhile quarterback Griffin Goodwin, entering the game in the second quarter after suffering an injury last week, threw two touchdown passes. \nThe Leopards will take a bye next week and play host to Lumpkin County on Oct. 16. \nFannin County (2-3, 0-1), meanwhile, will look to bounce back against Lumpkin County next Friday.
