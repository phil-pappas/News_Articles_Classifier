Both teams won their High Desert League openers and appear to be pretty evenly matched. \nMcQueen (3-2, 1-0) downed Hug last week and Spanish Springs (2-3, 1-0) beat North Valleys. \nThe Cougars had lost their two previous games, but came out fast against the Panthers. The Cougars had three touchdowns in the first quarter, one on a fumble recovery. \nJunior quarterback Korbin Marcum completed 17-of-25 passes for 244 yards and two scores, both to Austin Cadenhead, who had eight catches for 149 yards. \n“We’re coming in after a win and we’re just hungry for another one,” Marcum said. “Practices are starting to flow more efficiently and we’re starting to get our jobs done. Our team’s just finally starting to click after a rough preseason.” Rebuild underway for Hug football \nIn the Lancers win over Hug, junior John York had 16 carries for 120 yards and two scores. Lancers’ senior outside linebacker Collin Crown celebrated his birthday with 10 tackles, six solo, three for loss, had a blocked field goal attempt and a fumble recovery for a touchdown. \nThe Lancers’ defense will be tested Friday. Spanish Springs has the fourth-ranked offense, averaging 327 yards per game, while McQueen is No. 6 (307). McQueen had the fifth-ranked defense, giving up 297 yards per game while Spanish Springs allows 327. \nReed has not lost all season and the Raiders will likely be the top seed in the High Desert, which leaves, the other five schools fighting for second place and a first-round home game in the playoffs. \nReno (4-2, 0-1), which lost at Reed last week is at Hug. Reno, McQueen and Spanish Springs would all like to get that No. 2 spot to get a home game in the playoffs. \nCarson has not lost since the season-opener to Reed and seems to be firmly in control in the Sierra League. Douglas is in second place as it got its first win last week and will have to hold off Galena and Damonte Ranch for the coveted No. 2 spot. \nCarson (5-1, 1-0) is at Bishop Manogue on Saturday for the Miners’ homecoming. \nDouglas (1-5, 1-0) is at Galena (3-2, 0-0), which is coming off a bye and Damonte Ranch (2-3, 0-1) hosts Cathedral Catholic in a non-conference game. \nFriday : 7 p.m., Reed at North Valleys; Reno at Hug; Spanish Springs at McQueen; Carson at Bishop Manogue; Douglas at Galena; Sparks at Fallon; Wooster at Fernley. 7:30 p.m., Cathedral Cathloic (San Diego) at Damonte Ranch. \nSaturday : 1 p.m., Carson at Bishop Manogue. \nFootball", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:22:37.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
