He is team-oriented and hardworking and he brings a lot of good characteristics to the team,” Clifford said, adding that the team will stick to its basic principles while also making a lot of adjustments for preseason. \nSpeaking ahead of tonight’s game, Lin, the National Basketball Association’s first Chinese-American player, said: “We are not sure how good we can be but we are sure we will do whatever we can do to show how good we can be.” \nLin scored 16 points in 28 minutes in the first game in Shenzhen on Sunday, which the Hornets won 106-94. \nDuring his stay in China, Lin has been repeatedly asked about his new “spiked” hairstyle several times. \nYesterday, the 27-year-old made it clear that he was focusing on playing basketball and had no intention of talking about fashion. \nLin’s teammate, 2013-14 All-NBA Third Team forward Al Jefferson, said they needed to do better than in Shenzhen. \n“We just got through a battle in Shenzhen but still have things to improve. It is a good chance for us to play against a great team like the Clippers,” he said. \nFor the Clippers, All-Star guard Chris Paul and Austin Rivers, who both missed the Shenzhen clash with injuries, will play tonight, head coach Doc River revealed. \nHigh-flying dunker Blake Griffin and formidable center DeAndre Jordan are also available. \nPaul said the Clippers are determined to play harder in Shanghai. \n“We still have the confidence and we have the talent and ability. All we have to do is put it together. We will pay attention to every detail and practice more before getting on the court,” he said. \nOn Clippers’ ambition for the new season, Rivers said, “We are getting there. We are preparing for the upcoming season. This trip here has been good for us. We are on the bus more together. We are going to dinner together. I think things are going the way we want them to go. We are the champions, hopefully.” \nClippers also hosted an NBA Cares clinic on Monday at the Mercedes-Benz Arena. \nSixty students from Shanghai Yangjing-Juyuan Experimental School took part in the activity and received encouragement and tips from NBA legends Jerome Williams, Ronald Harper as well as players from the Clippers. \nTonight’s clash will be the sixth NBA preseason game to be staged in Shanghai since 2004 when its homegrown star Yao Ming led the Houston Rockets against the Sacramento Kings at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:11:51.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
