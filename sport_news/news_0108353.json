The attack was dubbed in the media as \"the second Rafah massacre.\"\nThe defendants appealed the sentence and the case went through a retrial, in which another death sentence was handed down.\nSix out of the 34 defendants are being tried in absentia.\nThis is the second death sentence for Habara for being part of a jihadist group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:21:04.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
