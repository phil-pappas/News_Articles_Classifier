Brad Biggs Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune 10 thoughts on the Bears' OT loss to the Lions from @BradBiggs \nTen thoughts after the Chicago Bears squandered some late opportunities in a 37-34 overtime loss to the Detroit Lions at Ford Field. \n1. General manager Ryan Pace doesn’t have to rush into any decisions when it comes to wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. But that doesn’t stop Mailbag questions about him from coming in pretty much every week. What are the Bears going to do with Jeffery, especially considering all the time he missed with hamstring and calf injuries since the opening of training camp? It will not take many more performances like Jeffery had here – 11 targets, eight receptions, 147 yards and one touchdown – to make it a no-brainer for Pace and those he involves in the decision. \nThe Bears had only one place to turn when they trailed 34-31 with 21 seconds remaining and the ball on their own 20-yard line. Jeffery. Jeffery. Jeffery. Two catches for 49 yards and a 20-yard pass interference penalty against Lions cornerback Darius Slay. A top of the line player can produce when everyone in the building knows where the ball is going. Jeffery, who had been out since the opener against the Packers, legitimized the offense with a downfield threat again. Sure, Marquess Wilson made some plays in his absence, but he’s not in the same class, not close. \nOne thing I was interested to track was how much Jeffery would be used after such a long layoff and considering he also missed all of preseason. What kind of shape would he be in? By my count he was on the field for 68 of the team’s 79 offensive snaps, including every play on the final seven possessions. Fitness was not an issue. \n“Football shape is different,” Jeffery said. \nThat’s true and now that the Bears have him back in action, they need him to remain healthy because he’s clearly at the top of the priority list for offensive coordinator Adam Gase. The Bears used him in a variety of ways, downfield, underneath and on fade routes. The 11-yard touchdown reception on the seam route was perfect. Quarterback Jay Cutler put the ball up high where only Jeffery could make the play and he extended and got it done. The better athlete was the bigger athlete on that play. \nAs I said, the Bears don’t have to rush into any decisions but it’s pretty clear they’re in no position to allow a young player (Jeffery is 25) to leave the building. There are 10 regular-season games remaining and if I had to choose which option is most likely, I’d guess the Bears wind up tagging Jeffery in order to prevent him from reaching the open market. At that point, they see if they can work out a long-term deal but they need him. The original plan was to pair him with Kevin White and there’s no telling precisely what White, the seventh overall pick, will be. More on his situation on the Physically Unable to Perform List a little lower down. \n2. If you were not concerned about the quality of the secondary entering the season, you should be now. The Bears have a lack of playmakers and I don’t think there has been a game to highlight that weakness more than this one. Understand Matthew Stafford’s 4-5 yards on 27 of 42 passing isn’t being placed on the secondary alone. Far from it. The pass rush was inconsistent, at best, and inadequate at times. Covering the aging Calvin Johnson can be a challenge for even skilled pros. But the Bears are not making plays on the ball downfield and that’s bothersome. They’ve gone six games without an interception by a defensive back. In press box statistics, the defense was credited with two pass deflections, both by linebackers. According to the coaches’ review of film, the secondary had 13 pass breakups through the first five games with Alan Ball, Kyle Fuller and Sherrick McManis all tied with three each. \nFuller arrived to dislodge the ball from Golden Tate on the disputed touchdown call late in the second quarter. More on the officials and the call later. Bottom line? Fuller was beaten inside and he was late arriving to make the play. Tracy Porter didn’t get a jam on Megatron like he needed on the 6-yard touchdown pass that put the Lions ahead with 21 seconds remaining in the second quarter. When Lance Moore scored the game’s first touchdown pass on a 20-yarder, I thought nickel cornerback Sherrick McManis was put in a difficult spot. He was asked to trail Moore with no jam. Moore’s aging but asking him to turn and run there is tough and that’s asking a lot of a guy who has been a career special teams performer. Kyle Fuller John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune \nBears cornerback Kyle Fuller tackles Lions running back Ameer Abdullah in the second quarter. \nBears cornerback Kyle Fuller tackles Lions running back Ameer Abdullah in the second quarter. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) \nThe 57-yard deep ball to Johnson in overtime that set up the game-ending field goal was Cover Two. Fuller had Johnson off the line of scrimmage and passed him off to fill-in rookie safety Harold Jones-Quartey. That was the call. Stafford created time and space for Johnson by rolling out. \n“I ran to his hip and I was looking at his body language and his head was looking up so I looked up and we were still jockeying for position,” Quartey-Jones said. “He just made a good play on the ball. Whenever your number is called you’ve got to go make a play. There are no excuses. I gotta go make a play and I came up short. That just means I need to do something better so when the opportunity presents itself again, I can help the team win regardless of who it is.” \nWe’ll see when the secondary can end the interception drought. Defensive backs totaled 13 a year ago as Fuller and safety Ryan Mundy had four each. Fortunately, coach John Fox is a former secondary coach. I’ve got to imagine he has a good idea about the limitations he faces from a personnel standpoint. \n3. Rookie linebacker Jonathan Anderson , an undrafted free agent from TCU, was appearing in his first NFL game and looked to have a huge play in the end zone in the final minute of the first half when cornerback Kyle Fuller popped the ball loose from Golden Tate in the end zone. Defensive tackle Eddie Goldman got a hand on the ball and then Anderson corralled it for a takeaway. Or so the Bears thought. \nBecause a turnover was involved, there was an automatic review and upon review referee Walt Coleman, who communicates with the NFL command center in New York, over turned the call on the field and awarded Tate a touchdown. \nHere’s why if you are criticizing the officials, you’re off base. The problem isn’t them. The problem is the rule. \n“The receiver gained possession of the ball with two feet down, and he was standing upright,” Coleman told a pool reporter after the game. “He wasn’t going to the ground, he was standing upright. Two feet down. Possession of the ball. Takes it one more step, and then the ball was stripped out. Well in the endzone, once you have the completed catch, it’s a touchdown. The play is over. He was standing upright. It wasn’t like he was going to the ground where he would have had to have held onto the ball. But he was standing upright. Completed the catch with the ball in the endzone –that makes it a touchdown.” \nHere is what Dean Blandino, the NFL’s vice president for officiating, said in a video the league posted during the game. \n“The ruling on the field was an interception. Golden Tate controlled the pass right at the goal line,\" Blandino said. “The ball came loose and was eventually caught by a Chicago defender. This is different than the plays we've been talking about, the Dez Bryant play or the Calvin Johnson play. This is not a receiver who's going to the ground. The issue here is, did he become a runner before the ball came loose? Did he have control, both feet down, and then time enough to become a runner after the second foot is down. \"When you watch the play the ball comes loose, he is taking his third step, the third step is almost on the ground when the ball comes out. He had demonstrated possession, had become a runner, once the ball breaks the plane of the goal line in possession of a runner it is a touchdown and the play is over at that point.\" \nThe rule is covered in Rule 3, Section 2, Article 7, Item 2 and ESPN.com’s Kevin Seifert has been tackling this issue, as well as anyone can, all season long. He posted the rule which states the NFL requires a receiver to \"clearly become a runner.” The receiver does that “by gaining control of the ball, touching both feet down, and then after the second foot is down, having the ball long enough to clearly become a runner, which is defined as the ability to ward off or protect himself from impending contact.” \nIf you go by two feet and possession, Tate definitely had a touchdown. The more confusing issue is what to do with plays when the receiver is going to the ground. Surely, it will be something people talk about when it comes to the competition committee in the offseason ahead. Who knows whether or not it’s something that committee will take action on. \n4. Interested to see how linebacker Jonathan Anderson looks in film review. He started the game because the Bears opened in their nickel package and got pretty good playing time as he and LaRoy Reynolds shared the job belonging to Shea McClellin, who was out with a knee injury. Anderson made a strong push for the practice squad with a big finish to preseason and he was involved here. He was credited with three tackles and had an interception when Matthew Stafford made an ill-advised shotput pass to a back. A sack by Anderson was negated by a defensive penalty. He was promoted to the 53-man roster last week. \n“It was fun to play in a regular-season game for the first time but the outcome doesn’t feel good,” he said. “None of what I did positive really means anything.” Chicago Bears v Detroit Lions Christian Petersen / Getty Images \nHarold Jones-Quartey and Eddie Goldman celebrate a second quarter interception by Jonathan Anderson.

(Christian Petersen / Getty Images) \nAnderson said he had been treating practices on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays as “mini games” while he was on the practice squad. \n“You never know when it is going to be your turn,” he said. \nAnderson also played on all four phases of special teams and it will be interesting to see if he can keep a role on the 53-man roster when McClellin returns, likely some time next month. Anderson has an interesting background. He started only 16 of 51 games at TCU and was beaten out for a starting job by Paul Dawson, a third-round pick of the Bengals, last year. \nNeither player fit at middle linebacker in the scheme so they battled it out for the outside linebacker position and Dawson won. It didn’t mean Anderson wasn’t good. He was just behind a pretty darn good college linebacker. \n“It’s a really long story pretty much,” Anderson said. “I mainly made my debut here on special teams because that is what I did last year at TCU. There were some games I did start but it’s just the majority of my games as a senior, I didn’t start. You just have to fight through and wait for your opportunity and that is exactly what I did. I just trained like I was going to get drafted and I feel like I did pretty well during my pro day and that was my shot right there.” \nWe’ll see what he does with his shot now. \n5. With a week off now, left tackle Jermon Bushrod said he expects to return from a shoulder injury for the Nov. 1 game against the Vikings at Soldier Field. He’s been out for three games now and was also battling a concussion, something he was cleared to return from last Monday. \n“I have no bye week because I have been banged up,” Bushrod said. “I am going to put in extra effort to make sure I am ready to go.” \nCharles Leno has played well in Bushrod’s absence and might have had his best game here where he went almost exclusively against defensive end Ziggy Ansah, who entered with five sacks to tie for the NFL lead. Ansah started getting some pressure late in the game, but Leno was strong against him. \n\"He’s been playing well,” Bushrod said. “His technique has been great. I try to work. We are just trying to help each other out.” \nBushrod has worked with Leno since the Bears drafted him in the seventh round last year. He’s a veteran player interested in making the younger player at his specific position better. Not every older player is that way.

(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) \n“I’m paying it forward,” said Bushrod, citing Jon Stinchcomb, Zach Strief and Jamaal Brown as veterans that helped him early in his career with the Saints. “I could lean on them for different things and I thought that was very important in my career. It still is. I look at some of the things (Leno) does and try to pick out some of the things he does that can help me. \n“That’s what football is about. That is what life is about. If someone plays better than you, then they played better than you. I those situations, I want to help because I was helped. I was brought up in a way that you’re going to help people out no matter what the situation is. The ultimate goal here is to win games.” \nLeno said the three-game stretch has gone a long way toward raising his confidence. \n“I am much more confident but I have always been a confident player,” he said. “I would say one thing I did do was get back in the film room and get out on the practice field and work harder (after preseason). The opportunity arrived and I wanted to make sure that I seized it. I wish the outcome was better. I really don’t want to talk about my performance, I want to talk about the team.” \n6. Second-year defensive lineman Ego Ferguson tried to gut it out with a knee injury originally suffered in the season-opening loss to the Packers but the decision was made this past week to shut him down for the remainder of the year by placing him on injured reserve. The belief is Ferguson has a partially torn patellar tendon and that could require surgery, although a decision has not been finalized. He was limited in practice this past Wednesday after playing 15 snaps in the 18-17 victory at Kansas City. But the knee was problematic and Ferguson was held out Thursday and Friday as the Bears prepared to add a replacement in Bruce Gaston, who was signed off the practice squad of the Green Bay Packers. \nFerguson was held out of the Week 2 game against Arizona after suffering the injury and came back to play 34 snaps the next week at Seattle and then 33 in Week 4 against Oakland but the knee issue wasn’t getting any better. \nFerguson was still listed atop the team’s depth chart at defensive end and he was replaced by second-round draft pick Eddie Goldman. Jeremiah Ratliff left the game with a neck injury and this is a spot where the Bears are a little thin although Bruce Gaston, who they signed off the practice squad of the Packers on Saturday, is an interesting prospect based on a productive preseason. \n7. Defensive lineman Mitch Unrein had a decision to make when the Chargers cut him in a roster switch late in Week 3. San Diego informed Unrein it planned to re-sign him the following Monday and it was so late in the week, he’d already received a game check from the team. The Bears got on the phone and they let Unrein know they wanted him. That day. For that weekend. He wound up signing with the Bears, going to Seattle and playing in that Week 3 game. \nThe 28-year-old had spent the previous four seasons playing for John Fox in Denver and knew San Diego coach Mike McCoy from the Broncos as well.

(Ed Zurga / AP) \n“I had to make a decision, the best decision for my wife and I, and decided to come here,” he said after Sunday’s game. “I know the staff out there. I did know McCoy out there in San Diego but I knew the staff here, the D-line coach (Jay Rodgers) and folks like that, and I wasn’t getting to play too much in San Diego. I just felt like this was a better fit and I knew I would get more playing time.” \nThe Bears have not only been using Unrein as a part of the regular rotation on defense, he’s been used in the backfield as a fullback, something McCoy first started with him in 2012. He was in the backfield with Jeremy Langford and Matt Forte when Langford scored on a 1-yard run. \n“As a defensive lineman to go on the offensive side of the ball and go and block somebody instead of being blocked is kind of fun,” said Unrein, who caught a touchdown in 2012 against the Buccaneers. “I will do whatever they want me to. I’m not going to go in there demanding things being a defensive guy. It’s pretty cool.” \n8. Jarvis Jenkins was sent to the locker room in the final moments of the second quarter after a pile up as team officials ordered he undergo a check for a concussion. The defensive end has banged helmets with another player and quickly made a case to remain on the field with medical personnel when he was told they were in charge, not him. He was emphatic but to no avail. Fortunately, he was cleared and returned to action in the third quarter. Jen \n“They say if you get hit in the head, you’ve got to have safety precautions and they took me through the tests,” he said. “I was all right. I just got my head hit a little bit, helmet to helmet. It’s a good rule though. A lot of guys lie and then make it worse for themselves. It’s all a precaution and it’s for our best interests.” \nJenkins and defensive tackle Eddie Goldman split a sack giving Jenkins 3 ½ although he lamented “missing a layup” on another play when he could have brought down Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford. \n9. The guess here is it is a longshot that first-round draft pick Kevin White will appear in a regular-season game but let’s review the rules of the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list. This is the first week White is eligible to actually participate in practice. However, that does not mean it is going to happen. Players on the reserve PUP are eligible to begin practicing for a period not to exceed 21 days between this week and the end of the 11th week of the regular season (Nov. 24). At the end of a three-week practice window, a team has to decide whether or not to activate a player on PUP to the 53-man roster or shut him down for the remainder of the year. If a player is shut down, he is not eligible to practice. \nWhite has yet to practice in full pads as the stress fracture in his left shin was diagnosed in early June. NFL rules prohibit teams from conducting more than one practice per week in full pads. In fact, teams are limited to a total of 14 practices in full pads during the regular season, 11 of which must occur during the first 11 weeks of the season. So, it would be a challenge to get White in football shape even if his leg is healed and he gets clearance. \nPhotos of the No. 7 overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft. \nThe wide receiver was doing some rehabilitation work on the side with a trainer during practice on Thursday. That’s a positive sign but it’s a long ways off from him being promoted to the 53-man roster for game action. It’s really not worth speculating on whether or not White will be activated until (or if) White begins practicing in a three-week window. And remember one more important thing: It’s entirely possible the Bears do start the three-week practice window for White solely to get him accustomed to in-season practices. Give him a feel for the action and let him run around on the scout team for a little bit. \n10. John Fox-coached teams have played good football with an extra week off during the regular season. Fox has the third-best record among active coaches after the bye week at 10-3 (.769) during his stays in Denver and Carolina. Packers coach Mike McCarthy it tops at 8-1 (.889), including the 55-14 victory over the Bears at Lambeau Field last year coming out of Green Bay’s bye. Chiefs coach Andy Reid has long been known for his post-bye success dating back to his days with the Eagles. He’s 14-2 (.875) after the bye.

Smart play by safety Demontre Hurst to push Lions wide receiver Corey Fuller into the rolling punt that led to one of two takeaways for the Bears on punts. \n“I just saw the ball bouncing around and he didn’t know where the ball was at,” Hurst said. “He was still trying to block me and it was right next to us. I just tried my best to push his whole body into it. Even though it got the nick of his heel, it still hit him. I didn’t get a bunch of him, but I got enough of him. Chris (Prosinski) was just on it (to recover the ball). Once you get your opportunity to go out there, especially on teams, I always say it is about execution and effort. Just do what you do. If you work hard, plays will come to you.” \nIt’s a legal play for Hurst to push Fuller there but if officials ruled he was “passive,” it would have been Lions ball. Referee Walt Coleman said that was not eligible for review that the play went to official review simply to determine if the ball contacted Fuller, which it did. \n10b. The Bears will hold practices on Tuesday and Wednesday and then be off for the remainder of the week. The collective bargaining agreement mandates players must be given off a minimum of four consecutive days during the bye week, including a Saturday. So old school folks have no grounds to complain about John Fox giving players a Thursday through Sunday weekend. \n10c. Christian Jones was credited with a team-high nine tackles in press box statistics. Thought he was pretty active. \n10d. Returner Marc Mariani isn’t getting a lot done with punts but I think it has to do with the 10 other players on the field as much as him. On a 60-yard punt, which should leave at least a little room to operate, he had pretty much nowhere to go. \n10e.
