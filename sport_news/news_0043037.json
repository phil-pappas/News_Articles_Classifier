We have work to do and we need to improve to have a chance in the summer, but we have done pretty well since the World Cup. \n\"The squad is changing with injuries but everyone is buying in to the philosophy of how the manager and staff want to play and it is working well, so long may that continue. \n\"They will be a good test. If we win them, great. If we don't, we have to take things from them. They will be tough, but they are ones we are looking forward to.\" \nHodgson's team are unbeaten since crashing out of last year's World Cup at the group stage, having added to their perfect qualifying record with friendly draws against Italy and the Republic of Ireland. \nWhen asked if maintaining the record was now a matter of personal pride for the players, Chelsea defender Cahill replied: \"For sure, but we don't want to get too carried away with it. \n\"Obviously we have done so much hard work from the disappointment in the summer. To get nine out of nine we want to finish the job and be a part of that record and hopefully we can do that.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:58:47.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
