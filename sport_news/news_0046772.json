She is not just from the famed stables of the Gopichand academy, she also belongs to the famous badminton family - the Pullela family. \n\nAt 12, Gayatri is showing signs of following in the footsteps of her illustrious parents - father Gopichand and mother Lakshmi. \n\nOn Friday, the extremely talented shuttler assured herself of her first international medal when she advanced to the under-15 doubles semifinals of the Badminton Asia Junior Championships in Kudus, Indonesia. Gayatri and her partner, 13 year-old Vaishnavi Reddy, defeated Indonesia's Denisa Dwisyawaliah Budiani and Nakhla Aufa Dhiya Ulhaq in a hard fought quarterfinal 15-21, 21-18, 21-19. \n\nLakshmi, who accompanied Gayatri to Kudus, is extremely excited at the progress of her daughter. \"Very happy and excited as it's their first international tournament. They gave their best,\" Lakshmi told TOI from Kudus. \n\nIncidentally, the under-15 team was not cleared by the Sports Authority of India and the parents are bearing the entire expenses of their wards. The fate of the team was not clear until they boarded the plane at 9.50 p.m. on Monday. \n\nBefore this feat, Gayatri has won several medals at the national level. \"It's a good beginning for her. I didn't think she was ready for a medal so early, but she has surprised me. Hope this will motivate her to do even better in future,\" Gopichand said.
