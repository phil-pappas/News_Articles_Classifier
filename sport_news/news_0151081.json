About 6,000 of them arrived and reported themselves to the authorities. All of them cannot be revolutionaries as it evident from the fact that 4,000 have been allowed complete liberty of movement. Nearly 1,700 have been restricted to their villages or put on security, more probably because they were only suspected and it is possible that many of them have absolutely no lawless intention. About 250 are said to have been interned temporarily and in their case also it is probable that there is mere suspicion and no evidence to try and secure their conviction under any Act. Now, what strikes every loyal and peaceful Punjabi is the question of their future, and how it will be settled. It is necessary to avoid any further unpleasantness or discontent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:08:33.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
