On Tuesday, he picked up his first offer since pledging to the Tigers.\n\"Florida offered me today,\" Coxie told NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune.\nEven though Coxie is committed to LSU, he hopes the offers continue to pour in.\n\"I hope to get offers from many schools. It's always good to have a open mind,\" the receiver said. \"LSU is my dream school, but it's good to keep your options open.\"\nThe 6-foot-3, 185-pound standout was in Baton Rouge over the weekend to watch LSU's 35-28 victory over Florida.\n\"The game was exciting. It was really packed and everyone knew it was going to be a good game,\" he described the atmosphere in Tiger Stadium.\nAnd Coxie is liking what he's seeing from the LSU offense behind Leonard Fournette and Brandon Harris.\n\"The offense is nice. Brandon has a strong arm and does a good job and Leonard runs over everyone in his way. I love it.\"\nHere's LSU WR commitment Da'Monte Coxie ( @Only_1_Montay ) with a diving 27 yard TD catch! #nolaprep pic.twitter.com/Y3eOdbh5aY\nâ€” Julie Boudwin (@Julie_Boudwin) October 17, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/nolaprep?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Only_1_Montay", "http://t.co/Y3eOdbh5aY", "https://twitter.com/Julie_Boudwin/status/655199419638243328"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:38:06.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
