Orlando City didn’t matter. The doomsday scenario of slipping out of the MLS playoffs didn’t matter. Everything hinged on the Revolution rising to the occasion against New York City FC and taking care of business themselves.\nThere were no doubts left about the Revs’ ability to do so after yesterday’s 3-1 victory at Yankee Stadium. Lee Nguyen scored inside the first two minutes to establish the tone. Charlie Davies and Kelyn Rowe extended the lead before the hour, while David Villa’s late penalty kick did not prevent the Revs from securing their playoff place on the final day of the regular season.\nThis comprehensive performance arranged a one-off playoff at D.C. United on Wednesday in the knockout round. It also served as exactly the sort of foundation the Revolution wanted to forge as they plotted their postseason push.\n“I think it’s more than the result,” Rowe said. “I had faith in us not dropping too many goals here in New York. But I think, for us going forward, we didn’t have the best end of the season. The last four games weren’t our favorite, but going forward we came together as a team tonight. And, going forward, I think we’ll be that way Wednesday.”\nAny notions of a massive collapse — including an Orlando win, a Revolution loss and an eight-goal swing on goal difference — faded from the moment Nguyen slotted home in the opening minutes. His deft work to collect from Davies’ neat hold-up play and punish NYCFC for its shoddy defending provided his team with a necessary foothold.\n“The key tonight was making sure we were the first one to score,” Revs coach Jay Heaps said. “We could put them in a position where we could be tight shape-wise and look to get opportunities against them.”\nNYCFC huffed and puffed in possession, but their defensive issues eventually paved the way for the Revs to ease to victory. Davies rolled through a wild aerial challenge to slot the second goal inside the far post just before halftime. Rowe then drifted free to nod home Chris Tierney’s corner kick at the near post to settle matters.\nVilla grabbed the scantest of consolation goals for the already-eliminated hosts in the dying embers, but it did not stop the Revs from confirming their spot in the postseason. They hopped on a bus and returned to the Boston area after the game with their job done and their focus immediately shifted to the next challenge ahead — against a veteran United side thumped 5-0 at Columbus to close out its season.\n“For us, it was all about what we needed to do,” Heaps said. “It really had nothing to do with the other teams or the results in terms of what we needed to do going into this game.\n“It’s a good building block. I like when we get some momentum. Because when we get some momentum, we’re tough to play.”", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Revs+get+job+done%2C+earn+playoff+spot"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:00:55.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
