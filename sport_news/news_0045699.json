The charges: unlawful compensation, grand theft and official misconduct. \nThe arrest was a stunner for the Miami-Dade school district, which runs the night school for over 4,500 students at various campuses in the northeast region of the county. Billed as the largest and most successful adult-education program in Miami-Dade, students are taught everything from literacy to vocational skills. \n“These are the kinds of bribery cases by public officials that really outrage every single member of the community,” said Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle. “This was money that was intended to improve education.” \nRidore — who was too old to enroll in high school when he arrived from Haiti in the late 1980s — touted himself as a graduate of the program before he went on to earn degrees from Miami-Dade College, Florida International University and Barry University. \n“Now I’m back,” Ridore told the Miami Herald in 2006 in a story about the program helping Haitian immigrants learn English. \nAt the North Miami Adult Education Center, he oversaw more than 400 staffers and pulled in a salary of more than $110,000. Public corruption investigators targeted Ridore after receiving anonymous complaints that the principal had long “operated the school in an inappropriate manner” by hiring as many as 20 “ghost employees” who were paid but never showed up for work. \nThe school district on Monday released a statement that said: “Let this serve as an example that any attempt to engage in illegal activity or to defraud the community will not only be investigated, but prosecuted to the full extent of the law.” \nInvestigators with State Attorney’s Office and the Miami-Dade Inspector General’s Office suspect Ridore had other employees helping him in put phony hours for the ghost employees, according to an arrest warrant released on Monday. \nProsecutors and investigators with the Miami-Dade County Inspector General’s Office soon discovered that two ex-employees got paid over $14,000 in total – despite them actually being out of the country during their supposed work periods. \nSo far, Ridore has not been charged with an earlier hires, but detectives are still trying to figure out the scope of his suspected schemes. Ridore could not be reached Monday and it was unclear if he had an attorney. \nProsecutors arrested him after a confidential informant introduced the undercover detective to Ridore, who instructed the man how to get officially vetted through the school district’s website application process. \nThe undercover detective posed as a handyman – who worked mostly accepting cash – and explained he needed the job to help establish a record of credible employment for tax purposes. Ridore agreed because he needed the man’s help rehabilitating a foreclosed home he had recently purchased. \nFinally in July, the two met inside Ridore’s SUV. The undercover detective paid him $1,000 during a meeting inside Ridore’s SUV in July. He told the undercover cop “it’s your job ... you don’t have to do nothing, man,” the warrant said. \n“If somebody come to you and say I asked you give money – that’s not true,” he instructed the undercover officer. \nProsecutors say Ridore was concerned about police –at one point, he frisked the officer and checked his phone to ensure he was not recording their conversation. He missed the recording devices used by the detective. \nWeeks went by and the officer never went to work. Ridore also never “instructed” him to attend work, the warrant said. \nFinally on Monday, the officer met up again with Ridore to pay him half of his salary. Once Ridore accepted the cash, he was arrested. \nMiami Herald reporter Christina Veiga contributed to this report.
