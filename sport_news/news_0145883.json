He has averaged nearly seven innings per start with a 2.41 ERA and has generally looked like a dependable, in-control starting pitcher.\nIn seven starts away from Los Angeles, including the most treacherous locales in the National League, he has looked anything but dependable. He has finished barely more than five innings per outing with a 6.19 ERA and walked almost as many hitters as he has struck out.\nHis Friday night start against the San Diego Padres fit the form. He cruised through seven pitch-efficient innings at his preferred location and carried the Dodgers to a 6-2 victory.\nIn his quest to be selected to make a playoff start, he has created an unusual set of circumstances with his unusual set of splits. Home-field advantage for the Dodgers’ first-round series against the New York Mets is still in the balance, and if the Dodgers obtain it, Wood would be slated to start a game at Citi Field, not Dodger Stadium.\nBut both venues are demonstrated pitchers’ parks, and it’s not yet even clear Wood will start a game at either location. The Dodgers may well select fellow left-hander Brett Anderson to start Game 3, and then elect to use ace Clayton Kershaw on short rest for a potential Game 4, relegating Wood to the bullpen.\nHe has pitched playoff relief previously. He said Friday one thing is of the most import when pitching in the playoffs: “Who wants it more?”\n“That’s what it’s about, to a certain extent,” he said. “After that, the numbers and matchups come into play. I’ve only had a small taste, but it’s a different atmosphere, who can elevate their games to a next level.”\nDodgers catcher A.J. Ellis said Wood’s fastball command was particularly sharp Friday. The 24-year-old walked one batter and needed only 88 pitches to finish his seven innings of two-run baseball.\n“I’m really impressed with the way he’s been throwing the ball as of late,” Ellis said. “And he continued it today. It was a really good mix.”\nWood struck out four, walked one and held San Diego scoreless until his final inning. His teammates put together five runs in the third inning and an additional run in the fifth to secure the victory, their 90th this season.\nAfter Wood struck out, batting, to begin the third, Carl Crawford, Howie Kendrick and Adrian Gonzalez strung together singles, for one run. Justin Turner reached base on an error, to plate a second run, and Andre Ethier drove in another with a groundout. Corey Seager singled, scoring a fourth, and Ellis scored him with a single.\nBut Ellis’ single was not really a single. He drove a fastball from Padres starter Casey Kelly 400 feet to straightaway center and attempted to reach second base.\nTurner gave him grief in the dugout for the mistake and for his lack of speed. Two innings later, when Turner singled to drive in the Dodgers’ final run, he had a shot at reaching second unscathed but opted against it. Ellis locked eyes with him from the dugout and raised his arms, as if to say, “Hey!”\nThe Dodgers (90-70) feel free to joke, even with home-field advantage undecided. In that race, they moved a half-game up on the Mets, who were rained out Friday and must play a day-night doubleheader, weather-permitting, Saturday.\nWhile Wood spoke to assembled media at his locker following Friday’s game, already dressed and ready to leave the stadium, catcher Yasmani Grandal interrupted the interview and held up his phone as if he was recording it.\n“I was wondering what the secret for your fabulous hairline was,” Grandal said.\n“Oh,” Wood said with a grin. “It was your barber.”\nContact the writer: pmoura@ocregister.com\nRelated: Zach Lee, Alex Verdugo are Dodgers' organizational players of the year On deck: Padres at Dodgers, Saturday, 6 p.m. Dodgers-Padres box score", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dodgers-685933-friday-year.html", "http://sports.ocregister.com/mlb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=351002119&final=true", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/face-685916-dodger-stadium.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:28:09.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
