Board member Bill Carpenter also questioned whether Corcoran should be making motions or discussing the issue since he is the one who filed the grievance.\nBut board member Claudia Manley said the same argument could be made against anyone on the board.\nHinsdale District 86 Board member files complaint against resident Kimberly Fornek Joan Brandeis, the mother of two Hinsdale South High School graduates, has spoken at many Hinsdale High School District 86 Board meetings in the past few years.\nSo she was surprised to learn a school board member had filed a complaint against her for remarks she made this summer.\nBoard member Edward...\nJoan Brandeis, the mother of two Hinsdale South High School graduates, has spoken at many Hinsdale High School District 86 Board meetings in the past few years.\nSo she was surprised to learn a school board member had filed a complaint against her for remarks she made this summer.\nBoard member Edward...\n(Kimberly Fornek) \"Truly, truly, I believe everyone here is conflicted,\" Manley said.\nManley proposed the vote on the superintendent's decision be broken into two questions, the first being whether Corcoran has standing to file a complaint.\nThat motion failed when only Manley and Corcoran voted in favor of it.\nManley and Corcoran then abstained from the vote to affirm the superintendent's decision.\nManley implied that both the administrators who ruled on Corcoran's complaint and members of the school board had conflicts of interest.\nBrandeis was the campaign manager for Carpenter, Kathleen Hirsman and Jennifer Planson, who won election in the spring defeating the candidates that Manley and Corcoran supported.\nThus, Manley said, they owe something to Brandeis, who was referred to as \"the alleged perpetrator.\" Manley said Brandeis raised almost $100,000 for the slate's campaign, although records filed with the State Board of Elections show that the District 86 Education First campaign fund, which supported Planson's, Hirsman's and Carpenter's election, had a balance of $6,125 as of Sept. 30, 2014, and received about $55,300 in donations and in-kind contributions over the next year.\n\"The amount raised in the campaign is irrelevant for what the board was voting on last night,\" Brandeis said Tuesday. \"In my opinion, the grievance should never have been made by a board member. It had no grounds and I have every right to state my opinion, especially when it is all fact.\"\nMaryam Judar, the executive director of the Citizen Advocacy Center in Elmhurst, asked the board to affirm Law's decision. She said when she heard a board member was using the school grievance policy \"to punish\" a member of the public for comments made at an open meeting, \"it immediately raised concerns of the abuse of power to intimidate people from utilizing their First Amendment rights to speak out on matters of public concern and offer their viewpoint.\n\"My concerns were underscored when members of the community contacted (the center) fearing the ripple effect such intimidation can have on the public's confidence to speak out,\" Judar said.\nJudar said public comments on items before an elected board is political speech which gets the highest First Amendment protection.\n\"Government cannot limit the public's speech based on its content,\" Judar said. \"A better platform for a trustee would be to use their position of power and access to the media to rebut with arguments and facts.\"\nkfornek@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @kfdoings\n Hinsdale Darien", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561426cd/turbine/ct-dhd-d86-corcoran-grievance-tl-1008-20151006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562671cf/turbine/ct-dhd-d86-corcoran-grievance-tl-1022-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:51:06.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
