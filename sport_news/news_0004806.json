In the process, he became the first Australian to score a hundred in every match of a four-Test series, and the first to score a hundred in his first three Tests as captain.\nSmith on his way to 199 against West Indies in Jamaica.

Australia went on to romp to victory by a whopping 405 runs.\n143 v England at The Oval, August 20\nThe series was over but, after a brief hiatus, Smith’s rediscovered his thirst for runs with a majestic 143 off 252 balls at The Oval, showing good patience early on before exploding late in an innings that featured 17 fours and two sixes.\nSmith salutes the crowd after reaching his century against England at The Oval.

His unbeaten 95-ball innings included six boundaries and a monstrous straight six late in the match.\nSteve Smith celebrates his century during the World Cup semi-final against India.

Thirty overs later the score was 2-197, with Smith having blasted 105 off just 93 balls to set up an emphatic victory against the reigning world champions.\nONE-DAY DOMESTIC CRICKET\n143 not out v CA XI at Bankstown Oval, October 5\nThe opposition may not have quite been of the calibre he had become accustomed to, but there are very few ‘off’ days for Smith and this was no exception as he blasted a hapless Cricket Australia XI attack at Bankstown Oval on the opening day of the Matador Cup. His knock included 10 fours and five sixes.\nSmith’s incredible run of form has continued in the Matador Cup. Picture: Mark Evans.

At first he had to lead a recovery job, coming to the crease in the first over and still having to bide his time with NSW 3-83 early in its innings. Naturally Smith stuck around and was able to unleash his impressive array of strokes late in the innings, particularly towards the leg side.\nFIRST-CLASS CRICKET\n111 retired v Kent in Canterbury, June 2\nAustralia’s vice-captain at the time warmed up for this year’s Ashes series with a casual hundred against Kent, showing his ability to adjust to the different conditions encountered in England.\nOriginally published as Smith’s incredible 2015 just got better", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/16/1227572/034021-77e553ee-73ce-11e5-b681-33b765f297a7.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/16/1227572/032938-876d6a4a-73ce-11e5-b681-33b765f297a7.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/16/1227572/044707-a75bef02-73ce-11e5-b681-33b765f297a7.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/16/1227572/032911-e4a7557c-73ce-11e5-b681-33b765f297a7.jpg", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/steve-smith-hundred-for-nsw-his-ninth-century-in-all-cricket-in-2015/story-e6frf3g3-1227572034083"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:33:22.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
