He had surgery to repair the injury July 28, but an accidental nick to the Dura surrounding the spinal cord caused spinal fluid to leak. He had a second surgery Sept. 4 to repair the leak.\n“The leak is fixed, but I’m still getting some symptoms. That’s why I’m out,” said Kerr, who is experiencing headaches and a loss of energy. “I wanted to be clear to you guys and the fans. I want to be upfront about what’s happened. Because I’m still having symptoms, it makes it difficult for me to be on the floor. …\n“The prospects are good. I’m going to heal.”\nWith the Warriors moving closer to an opening-night meeting with New Orleans on Oct. 27, Kerr wouldn’t put a timetable on his return. He said it’s just a matter of his body recalibrating.\nIn the meantime, Kerr is resting, reading, and rehabbing with swimming pool drills and walking. He’s also checking in on a portion of most practices and watching video of the Warriors’ exhibition games.\n© Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr walks after speaking to reporters at the team's practice facility in Oakland, Calif., Thursday, June 18, 2015.

I want to be here.\n“This is my dream job. These are my guys. We’re coming off a title, and the season starts in two weeks. It’s unbelievably frustrating. I want to be here, but I also know that I’ve got to be careful.”\nKerr said he is confident that interim head coach Luke Walton and the rest of the coaching staff are following the plan created before the start of training camp, but that doesn’t make the leave of absence any easier.\n“I’ve always loved my job,” Kerr said. “I’ve never taken it for granted - whether I was a player, a GM, a coach or a broadcaster. I love basketball, love being around the game and love the team. But when you’re forced to be away, it hurts.”\nRusty Simmons is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
