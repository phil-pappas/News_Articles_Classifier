(Image Source: Associated Press) \nHere’s a look at the Sunday Night Football matchup between the New Orleans Saints and the Dallas Cowboys: \nSeries: Cowboys Lead 16-11; Streaks: Saints won 3 of past 4; Last Meeting: Cowboys 38, Saints 17 (9.28.14) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: NBC (Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth & Michelle Tafoya) \nSpread: Saints -3; O/U 47 ½ \nInjury Report: Cowboys: Out: WR Dez Bryant (foot), DE Randy Gregory (ankle); Probable: CB Brandon Carr (not injury related), OG Ronald Leary (groin), DE Jeremy Mincey (concussion), DE Ryan Russell (groin), OLB Kyle Wilber (hamstring), TE Jason Witten (ankle/knee), LB Andrew Gachkar (foot) \nSaints : Out: OG Jahri Evans (knee); Probable: DE Cameron Jordan (back), QB Drew Brees (right shoulder), S Jairus Byrd (knee), WR Brandin Cooks (ankle), LB Dannell Ellerbe (toe), CB Keenan Lewis (hip) \nWhere They Stand: Coming off an NFC East title in 2014, the Dallas Cowboys were expected to be in contention for another division crown in 2015 and through two games it looked like a very likely possibility…until QB Tony Romo went down with injury. Dallas is 2-1, atop the NFC East, however they can’t feel great about the direction they’re going. Having said that they have to feel better about where they stand than the New Orleans Saints, who have their own QB issues. New Orleans is one of three winless teams and they are already three games behind both the Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons in NFC South. The Saints are probably going to miss the playoffs for back-to-back seasons for the first time since 2007-08. \nThe Cowboys: Stepping in for Tony Romo, backup QB Brandon Weeden has been solid, completing 29 of 33 passes (87.9 percent) for 305 yards and a passer rating of 102.7. Unfortunately, Weeden won’t have the luxury of throwing to WR Dez Bryant , which means WR Terrance Williams will be looked upon to step up and he had two TDs when the ‘Boys beat the Saints last season. Old reliable, TE Jason Witten is still there and he’s second all time among tight ends with 964 receptions and 10,683 yards. Without Romo, having the best O-line in football becomes even more important. Last week RB Joseph Randle ran for a career-high 87 yards and became the first Cowboy with three rushing TDs in the first half of a game since Emmitt Smith . RB Darren McFadden also had a rushing TD last week, while RB Lance Dunbar brings the ability to catch the ball coming out of the backfield. He leads all NFL running backs with 21 receptions, including a career-high 10 grabs last week. Dallas has a conference leader on the defensive side of the ball as well. LB Sean Lee , who had 10 tackles and a sack last week, leads the NFC with 33 tackles. Not only does he corral ball carriers, Lee plays the pass well, leading all LBs with 12 picks since 2010. Two other Cowboys who always seem to be around the ball are LB Anthony Hitchens and S Barry Church , who both have 20 tackles. \nThe Saints: How important is the status of QB Drew Brees ? He’s only the NFL’s leading passer since he signed with the Saints in 2006 with 44,295 yards and 318 TD passes. With 398-career TD passes, Brees just needs two scoring strikes to become the fifth passer to reach the 400 mark. The Texas native has won four of six against Dallas, with 16 TDs (3 INTs) and a 111.3 rating. Like Brandon Weeden, backup QB Luke McCown played well in Week 3 (31 of 38, 310 yards, 81.6 percent) and like Weeden, McCown’s effort wasn’t good enough to win. Part of the problem is the Saints don’t have as many weapons as they use to. WR Marques Colston is the one mainstay and he’s put up 28 receptions for 415 yards in his past four against the Cowboys. Second-year man Brandin Cooks leads the Saints this season with 190 receiving yards. The team’s offseason moves pointed towards a shift to running the football more. RB Mark Ingram is looking to get into the paint for the third-straight game and he’s second among NFL backs with 16 receptions. The former Heisman Trophy winner rushed for 145 yards and a TD in his last meeting with Dallas, while RB Khiry Robinson had 105 yards from scrimmage the last time he faced the Cowboys. They need more production from that duo tonight. Leading the defense is DE Cameron Jordan and S Kenny Vaccaro . You think of the Saints offense playing better at home, but some defenders also enjoy the dome. Jordan has recorded 17 sacks in the past 23 home games. Vaccaro, who had a sack against Dallas in their last meeting, leads the team with 20 tackles. \nPrediction: Having Drew Brees should give the Saints an edge. He says he can make all the throws but if he throws the ball anything anything like we saw against the Tampa Bay Bucs in Week 2, New Orleans shouldn’t count on winning by throwing the football all over the field. Having said that, with their potentially dominant offensive line, the Dallas Cowboys are better equipped to win football games without a huge passing game from their quarterback, so I’m backing the ‘Boys from Big D for an upset in the Big Easy. \nScore: Cowboys 20, Saints 17 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
