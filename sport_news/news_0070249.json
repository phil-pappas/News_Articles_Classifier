In fact, the “Late Show” host, who lived in Chicago for 11 years, is so inspired by the Cubs, he went on a rant against goats Thursday night, even going as far as kicking one out of his studio. John Goodman Debuts Dramatic Weight Loss on the Red Carpet “I’m not scared of you knuckle-kneed sheep wannabees anymore,” he said. “Oh, that feels good. So many things I’ve wanted to say about your kind for years, but I’ve been too afraid because of the curse. Not anymore.” He then went on to insult goat cheese and soul patch beards.
