But it is not about one game, we did a lot of the hard work beforehand. \n\"It is something we have been working for since we started and, fair credit to all the staff and all the fans, it is a moment to enjoy. \n\"The dressing room has been a lot of fun and it is something we have been working hard for. \n\"Now we have done it , we have crossed the line and will enjoy the occasion. It won't take time to sink in.\" \nWales' only previous tournament appearance came at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden when they qualified through the back door. \nHaving failed to progress from their group, Wales became a 'lucky loser' when Israel were ordered to play an eliminator against European opposition after Arab countries had refused to meet them in the wake of the Suez Crisis two years earlier. \nWales were drawn from the pot after Belgium passed up the opportunity to play Israel and they e ventually reached the quarter-final, losing 1-0 to Brazil as a 17-year-old Pele scored his first international goal. \n\"We know the history of Wales and we are the first team to actually qualify properly,\" Bale said. \n\"It has been our aim all the time and we have managed to put a good run in the qualification campaign. \n\"It is going to go down in history, but there is still a lot of work to do after this.\" \nWales will finish their campaign against group minnows Andorra on Tuesday night with Welsh football preparing for its biggest ever party. \nThe game at the Cardiff City Stadium is a 34,000 sell-out and Bale expects to start after completing his first full 90 minutes in Zenica for nearly a month. \nBale suffered a calf injury playing for Real in the Champions League on September 16 and was not at his scintillating best against Bosnia. \n\"It was good to get some minutes,\" Bale said. \n\"Hopefully I will be saying to the gaffer I want to play on Tuesday. \" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:57:48.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
