Baylor has appeared most worthy, but who have the Bears really played? They’ve beaten five unranked teams — a stat the selection committee won’t favor — by a combined 321-111 and have scored at least 56 points in every game.\nAdChoices Maybe Utah has the best resume right now, with that Week 1 victory over Michigan looking better and better every Saturday. The Utes beat undefeated No. 22 California 30-24, but have the most difficult part of their schedule remaining.\nOklahoma was assumed to compete with Baylor and TCU for the Big 12 title, but lost to Texas, and though Ohio State remains No. 1, has struggled to beat lesser opponents.\nEven if there’s not going to be one team to stand above the rest until November or maybe not even truly until January, they’re all keeping it interesting along the way. Here are three takeaways from this Saturday in college football:\nUnless, what about Michigan?\nJim Harbaugh and No. 21 Michigan posted their third straight shutout by blasting 14 th -ranked Northwestern 38-0.\n© Provided by USA Today Sports Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n#Michigan becomes 1st FBS team in 20 years w/ 3 straight shutouts & won 97-0 in this stretch. Jim Harbaugh more than living up to the hype.\n— Bruce Feldman (@BruceFeldmanCFB) October 10, 2015\nAre the Wolverines for real? They have the second-best defense in the country, holding teams to an average of 181.3 yards a game, and are tied for first with Boston College in only allowing opponents to convert on third down 18.8% of the time. That’s incredible.\nThe Wildcats were only able to amass 168 total yards and go 2-of-13 on third down. Michigan took care of the ball (and only has a minus-1 turnover margin this season which isn’t terrible), while Northwestern was more careless.\nIs Michigan’s success surprising? This is what Harbaugh does. His team is vastly improved in all three phases of the game and its only loss so far is to Utah, which is having the season of its life right now. We’ll learn if this team is for real next week when it hosts No. 3 Michigan State, who has been limping into unimpressive wins lately. Last week it was against Purdue and this week Rutgers nearly beat the Spartans. And it’s not crazy to think Michigan could beat Ohio State at the end of the year playing like this — or better — especially with the Buckeyes’ struggles and lacking dominance and consistency.\nKeep this up and Michigan might be a Playoff team.\n© Provided by USA Today Sports Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports Texas beat Oklahoma. What does that mean?\nCharlie Strong put on the golden cowboy hat trophy and his players tossed him up in the air in the most joyous of celebrations. This all after that Gatorade bath because Texas beat No. 9 Oklahoma 24-17. It was Strong’s most important win as the Longhorns’ second-year coach.\nJust last week Texas was stinking up college football thanks to an embarrassing 50-7 loss to No. 2 TCU. During halftime, cornerback Kris Boyd retweeted someone suggesting he transfer to Texas A&M. Afterward, Strong admitted it was the worst day of his coaching life. In the days that followed, veterans called out freshmen and got into public fights on social media. The turmoil was out of control and rival Oklahoma loomed.\nYet somehow, the Longhorns were able to figure it out and beat a team that was maybe supposed to compete for the conference championship and more. It appears Texas is better than its 1-4 record indicated, while OU more flawed than perfect 4-0.\nTexas rushed for 313 yards while the defense held Oklahoma to 68. Jerrod Heard may have only threw for 53 yards, but he ran for 115. Offensive coordinator Jay Norvell, formerly of the Sooners, is figuring out a nice role for former starting quarterback Tyrone Swoopes, too, having him come in red zone situations where he ran for a 3-yard touchdown Saturday.\nCould this be the season’s turning point for Strong? Texas is idle next week before facing winnable opponents in Kansas State, Iowa State, Kansas, West Virginia and Texas Tech. The Longhorns could realistically run the table before taking on Baylor in its regular season finale.\n© Provided by USA Today Sports Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\nIt’s a two-man Heisman race\nThrough six weeks of the season, the Heisman race is between LSU running back Leonard Fournette and TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin.\nFournette is different. He’s rushed for 1,022 yards and 12 touchdowns already and not only is he a special player on the field, but he’s shown character off it. LSU hosted South Carolina at Tiger Stadium on Saturday because devastating floods near Columbia, S.C. prevented the Gamecocks from having a home game. LSU was a classy host, flying the South Carolina flag and playing South Carolina school songs. Fournette had a historic performance, breaching the 1,000-yard rushing mark by going for 158 yards in the Tigers’ 45-24 win. And afterward, announced he would be auctioning off his jersey for charity to help those affected by the floods.\nThen there’s Boykin, who went 20 of 30 for 301 yards and two touchdowns (and two interceptions) while rushing for 124 yards and two more scores in TCU’s 52-45 win over Kansas State. This comes after a week in which he threw for 332 yards and five scores in a 50-7 win over Texas — who beat Oklahoma. His favorite target is Josh Doctson, who could be making a Heisman campaign of his own with his acrobatic catches every Saturday. In the last two weeks, he’s caught 25 passes for 396 yards.\nGeorgia running back Nick Chubb had been in contention, but left the Tennessee game early with a severe leg injury. Ohio State’s Ezekiel Elliott has rushed for 835 yards and 10 touchdowns so far — and hasn’t had one game below 100 yards — but the Buckeyes’ average performances aren’t helping him.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2015/10/10/michigan-football-defense-vs-northwestern-contender-michigan-state/73755054/", "https://twitter.com/BruceFeldmanCFB/status/652981018001960960", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/leonard-fournette-actioned-off-jersey-for-charity-flood-relief-victims", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/jim-harbaugh-got-so-angry-that-his-brain-might-have-actually-exploded-this-time", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/this-week-proved-there-is-no-national-championship-favorite-in-college-football", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Michigan?src=hash", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:53:24.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
