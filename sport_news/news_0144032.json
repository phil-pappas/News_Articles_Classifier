Anaheim forward Corey Perry claims the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. \nThe Ducks defeat the Minnesota Wild in the Western Conference final while the Habs dispatch the Pittsburgh Penguins in the East final. \nEA, which develops the hockey video game in suburban Vancouver, had the Los Angeles Kings winning the Cup last season in its pre-season simulation and the St. Louis Blues the year before that. \nThe new simulation has the Buffalo Sabres, who finished last in the 2014-15 standings, missing out on the playoffs by just two points. The Los Angeles Kings make it back to the post-season only to lose in seven games to the Calgary Flames in the first round. \nEdmonton's Connor McDavid is named top rookie after finishing in the top 15 in scoring. \nMontreal goaltender Carey Price wins his second straight Vezina Trophy while Washington sniper Alex Ovechkin, with 55 goals, wins the Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy for the fifth time. \nPittsburgh star Sidney Crosby wins the Hart Memorial Trophy, Art Ross Trophy and Ted Lindsay Award. \n\"NHL 16\" is out now for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
