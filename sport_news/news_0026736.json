Your team will not go 0-82.\nThe B’s posted their first win of the 2015-16 campaign last night in impressive fashion, pounding a talented but still finding itself Colorado Avalanche team, 6-2, at the Pepsi Center.\nThe B’s got goals from Kevan Miller, Jimmy Hayes, Ty Randell, Chris Kelly, Ryan Spooner and David Krejci and got timely saves from goalie Jonas Gustavsson in his Bruins debut.\nLet’s see how they follow this up on Saturday night against the surprising Arizona Coyotes, but there was little not to like as the B’s continually made the Avs cough up the puck in dangerous areas of the ice.\n“The focus and the determination of our group was really good tonight,” coach Claude Julien said. “We realized we were giving up too many goals and that we had to respect the part of the game without the puck. Part of it was having layers and not having that many breakdowns. Again, we talked about managing the puck and it’s making better decisions with it so you don’t allow the other team to get those opportunities. I thought we did a better job of that overall.”\nGustavsson was very good until he gave up a bad, shortside goal to John Mitchell at 11:20 of the third period. But after Patrick Roy pulled the goalie with about 3:30 left, Krejci scored the empty-netter to finish it off.\nThe B’s scored first for the third time in four games and took a two-goal first period lead for the second time in as many games.\nBut it took them a few minutes to get their footing.\nOn the game’s first shift, Zdeno Chara had his shot blocked by Jarome Iginla and had to take a hooking penalty to prevent a clean breakaway.\nThat put the league’s best power play to work and the Avs did have some good zone time, but Gustavsson held the fort.\nThe B’s then slowly started taking control and took lead at 5:45. Brett Connolly just missed the net on a 2-on-1, but stuck with the puck and worked it back to Chara at the point. Chara dished it to Miller, who used traffic in front to beat Semyon Varlamov with a well-placed shot to the upper far corner.\nHayes made it 2-0 with his first goal as a Bruin at 8:11. Varlamov muffed a Chara shot and, with Randell, who was making his NHL debut, occupying two Avs in front, Hayes swooped in and popped home the loose puck.\nThere were a couple of hairy moments in the first. Defenseman Colin Miller had to make a nice sliding break-up of a 2-on-1. He then gave Mikko Rantanen a breakaway when his shot was blocked. The speedy Miller looked like he would easily catch Rantanen but he fell down, leaving it up to Gustavsson. The 18-year-old Rantanen picked his spot between the pads, but the big goalie got down quick enough to take it away.\nThe B’s held a 9-5 shot advantage in the opening period and kept the Avs hemmed in their own zone on several shifts.\nIt looked like the B’s might slip into their usual second period funk, but then at 3:46, Randell gave the B’s their biggest lead of the season. There was an offensive zone draw after Loui Eriksson was robbed by Varlamov. But they didn’t have to gnash their teeth long over that missed opportunity. Off the next faceoff, Adam McQuaid fired a shot that Randell tipped past Varlamov for a 3-0 lead.\nThe Bruins weren’t done yet.\nAt 9:30, they made it 4-0 after creating a neutral zone turnover of their own. Off the quick counterattack, Spooner fed Kelly, who made a nifty move to his backhander for his first of the year.\nIt turned into a boffo night for the much-maligned third line. Spooner created a turnover behind the Avalanche with the puck going out to Hayes, who made a nifty backhand pass back to Spooner for the 5-0 lead at 15:31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:49:54.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
