He did not play for the second straight night on Thursday against the Indiana Pacers. \n\"We're really happy with how LeBron came into camp. Came in great shape,\" Blatt said Thursday. \"We want to take good care of him for the start of the season. As you know in his great and storied career, he has amassed a lot of miles. We're trying to keep those preseason miles to a minimum.\" \nThe 30-year-old James, entering his 13th NBA season, is averaging 11 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 4.0 assists in the two preseason games he has played in Cincinnati and Columbus. \nJames is one of the few healthy Cavs players. Kyrie Irving (knee surgery), Iman Shumpert (wrist surgery), Kevin Love (shoulder surgery), J.R. Smith (hamstring), Matthew Dellavedova (sore ankle) and Timofey Mozgov (knee surgery) have missed games or have yet to play during the presason. \n\"I'm not having fun right now,\" Blatt said after the Cavs lost 107-85 to the Pacers on Thursday night to drop to 0-5 in the preseason. \"This has been a tough week.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:30:02.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
