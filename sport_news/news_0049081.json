Yes, after months of anticipation and excitement, the first poster of the film is out.\nStaying true to the Rajshri brand, the poster features Salman and his leading lady Sonam Kapoor striking a pose as the quintessential Indian couple. While Salman has two avatars in the film, Sonam will be seen playing Maithili- the Indian princess in the film. Given the way it's been made and presented, it has the typical trademark Sooraj Barjatya stamp on it written all over.\nThe two actors, who were seen together in Saawariya look sweet together and the first poster gives a hint of the mushy romance that the film will entail. Not just one, the film's poster was unveiled in three different languages- English, Hindi and Urdu.\nPrem Ratan Dhan Payo Posted #PremRatanDhanPayo @prdp @rajshri pic.twitter.com/hRpbfDYt0k\nâ€” Salman Khan (@BeingSalmanKhan) September 30, 2015\nThe film which also stars Neil Nitin Mukesh, Armaan Kohli, Swara Bhaskar and Anupam Kher will release on November 12 during Diwali.
