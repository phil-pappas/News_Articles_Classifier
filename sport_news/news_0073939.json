A week, which she will never forget rest of her life. \n\nSelected in the Indian team for the first time in her career, the promising city shuttler was really looking forward to participate in the Asian Junior Badminton Championship. She attended the ten-day long coaching camp and was all set to board a flight to Kudus, Indonesia. \n\nHowever, as the luck would have been she had to return home from the New Delhi airport as the Badminton Association of India (BAI) failed to send the U-15 squad under mysterious circumstances after Sports Authority of India (SAI) did not sponsor the tour expenses. \n\nMalvika was shattered. She needed something extraordinary to be back at her normal self. The latest rankings released by the BAI did just that. She jumped to second spot in the U-15 girls singles, creating a record of sorts as far as district badminton is concerned. The 14-year-old became the first city shuttler to reach No. 2 ranking in the U-15 girls singles. The first position is being shared by two players Aakarshi Kashyap of Chhttisgarh and Vaishnavi Jakka Reddy of Telangana with 1200 points. \n\nMalvika, a student of Centre Point School, Dabha, has 1125 points to her credit which helped her reach her career-best ranking. It has been a phenomenal rise for her. She was ranked No. 8 but a runner-up position at the last all India tournament at Gulbarga leapfrogged her to No. 2. She had a match point in the U-15 girls' singles final against Gayatri Gopichand but could not capitalized on it. \n\nAnother upcoming city shuttler Ritika Thaker and her partner Simran Singhi of Mumbai suburban, who were enjoying the No. 1 ranking in the U-15 girls doubles for nearly a year, has now slipped to second position. The pair of Ritika and Simran has lost couple of close finals to Gayatri Gopichand and Vaishnavi Reddy, which affected their top ranking. \n\nAround four years ago, Deepthi Ramesh was ranked No. 2 in the U-13 girls singles. Deepthi has now settled in Bangalore and trains at Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy. \n\n\"It was a pleasant surprise for me. For the last one year, I was trying to crack into first four rankings, which would have enabled me to get selected for representing India in overseas tournaments. I want to give all the credit to my coach Kiran Makode,\" Malvika told TOI on Wednesday. \n\nThe southpaw is eager to do well at the All India Sub-Junior Ranking tournament which will be held at Guntur next week to justify her elevated ranking.
