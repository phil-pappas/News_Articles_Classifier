They voted unanimously to \"release\" Frasher \"from his employment contract.\"\nThe commission also said Frasher's five-year contract with the city is invalid and that he is not entitled to the more than $400,000 severance package as he claims.\n\"The commission took this action because it has lost confidence in our city manager and believes it is time for a change,\" Mayor Dan Holladay said in a written statement issued after the half-hour public meeting.\nCommissioners otherwise declined to publicly comment on their decision or explain what led to the loss of confidence.\n\"Confidentiality and privacy afforded all employees in personnel matters, and a tort claim notice sent to the city by Frasher's lawyers suggesting that litigation is likely to be filed,\" the city said in its statement.\nDavid Frasher File photo/2009 Frasher, who was hired in 2010, did not attend the meeting.\n\"It has been a great run and one I will always remember fondly. I sincerely wish Oregon City the very best and offer a warm farewell to the wonderful staff, citizens and community leaders with whom I was privileged to work,\" Frasher said in a written statement issued after the meeting.\n\"My work was recognized by five consecutive outstanding performance appraisals, the most recent being in March of this year,\" Frasher said.\nFrasher, who earned $175,548 a year, was one of the highest paid city administrators in Oregon.\nLast week, Frasher filed a tort claim threatening legal action against the city, Holladay and possibly others. A tort claim is a required prerequisite before filing a lawsuit against a government agency.\nThe commission upped the ante on Tuesday, declaring that Frasher's five-year contract, signed in 2013, is invalid.\nThe city said Frasher is due around $44,000 in wages and accrued vacation time.\nCity officials said Tuesday that Oregon law prohibits commissioners from binding future commissions to a contract for \"providing governmental functions,\" including an employee's services\nSince Frasher's contract was signed in 2013, Holladay and two new commissioners were elected.\nA multi-year contract would have been valid if the commission ratified it annually, city officials said. That way newly elected commissioners would have a say.\nThe decision to put Frasher on leave on Aug. 13 apparently was prompted by a letter from Police Chief Jim Band but neither Frasher nor the city would disclose the substance of the complaint.\nHolladay said the complaint \"was not the basis for the commission's decision.\"\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive has a pending public records request for the complaint and results of an outside investigation of the complaint at the commission's request.\nFrasher said he would seek damages for defamation, retaliation, infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and violation of his civil rights and due process rights, according to the tort claim.\n-- Steve Mayes\nsmayes@oregonian.com\n503-294-5916; @ocmayes", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ocmayes"], "published": "2015-10-14T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:31:35.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
