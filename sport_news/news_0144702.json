(Reuters Photo/Mike Segar/Files) By : Ben Klayman | on 9:13 AM October 23, 2015 Category : Sports , More Sports \nMedical experts and National Football League (NFL) officials will gather with peers from other top global sports on Saturday in a bid to accelerate how to properly diagnose and treat player concussion s. \nThree dozen doctors and executives from rugby, hockey, football and athletics will meet in London at the NFL's second annual professional sports concussion conference . \nConcussion s and head trauma suffered by athletes remain a controversial topic, prompting many contact sports to change rules and adopt new protocols to ensure a higher level of player safety. \nThe NFL in April settled a lawsuit brought by about 5,000 former players who accused it of covering up the dangers of concussion s in a deal that could cost the league $1 billion. \nItems on Saturday's agenda include an expected announcement of an NFL collaboration with a foundation studying the long-term impact of concussion s on jockeys, and the sharing of a Canadian Football League study on identifying concussion s through eye movement tests, said Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president of health and safety policy. \nMiller said the conference will also consider a proposal for the NFL, international rugby and Australian Rules Football to test active rehabilitation as a better form of concussion treatment . \nSome critics see the NFL-hosted London event as window dressing by the various sports bodies to protect their revenue streams. The most-popular and powerful US sports league, revenues at the NFL topped $12 billion last year. \nBut the co-chairman of the NFL's head, neck and spine committee, Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, said the conference is meant to help fill in gaps in an area of medicine where a lot about concussion s remains unknown. \n\"It is accelerating the research because ... when you get a lot of scientists in a room you get a lot of controversy and discussion so the science is just better,\" Ellenbogen, also chairman of neurological surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told Reuters. \nFifteen different organizations will be represented in London, including the world football governing body FIFA, Australian Rules Football, World Rugby, the Canadian Football League and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports . \nAlso sending officials are the US Olympic Committee, the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). \nThe conference is being held ahead of an NFL game in London on Sunday between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars. \nSome critics said the NFL conference is a marketing bid to shape how the public views an issue that is still unfolding. \n\"What they're attempting to do is create a body of opinion and body of literature that tells the public that these concussion s are manageable ... short-term problems,\" said Michael Kaplen, an attorney specializing in traumatic brain injuries who teaches at George Washington Law School, and a long-time critic of the NFL's science around the subject. \nWhile Ellenbogen acknowledges the criticism is fair, he said the leagues must fight their biases to protect the athletes' health. \nMiller said player safety is a top priority for the NFL, pointing to 39 rules changes over the past decade related to player safety and a 34 percent decline in concussion s in the league over the last three years. The NFL has awarded more than $135 million in grants over the same period related to research on player safety. \nThe league and plaintiffs agreed that based on actuarial statistics up to 30 percent of former players could develop brain conditions such as Alzheimer's or a less debilitating form of dementia. \nMost sports leagues have been caught \"flat footed\" by the concussion issue, said Ohio University sports business professor Robert Boland. \nIn addition to the NFL, lawsuits have been filed in recent years against FIFA, the NHL and the NCAA. Even on the youth level the issue has gained prominence. \nUS President Barack Obama and National Basketball Association all-star LeBron James are among those who have said they would not allow their children to play pro football due to the dangers from head trauma. \nSeveral suicides by former NFL players, including Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau in 2012, garnered public attention. Last month, a study released by the Concussion Legacy Foundation found all but four of 91 former NFL players who donated their brains for research were diagnosed with a disease linked to concussion s and head trauma. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:59.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
