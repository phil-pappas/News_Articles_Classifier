At the same place four years later, M-E toppled the state's long-standing unbeaten streak record with a 45-30 win over rival Johnson City. \nThe win marked M-E's 56th consecutive victory, which tops Massena's record of 55 straight games without a loss in the 1950's. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nM-E accomplished the feat in front of some prestigious guests on the sideline. Maine-Endwell grad Thomas Tull, a part-owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, brought along Pro Football Hall of Famers Jerome Bettis and Franco Harris, along with former Steelers' coach Bill Cowher. The group watched from the Spartan sideline throughout the game. \nOn the field, M-E trailed 8-0 and 16-15 in the first half, but was able to overcome those early deficits to take a 31-16 lead at the half. \nIt was cruise control from there for M-E as the Spartans scored a few more touchdowns in the fourth quarter to seal the win. \nAfter the game a representative of Massena was there to congratulate the Spartans, a moment the team treasures. \n\"When you're closing in on it you always think it's pretty special, but when it actually is done you really realize how special it is,\" said head coach Matt Gallagher. \"Especially when you see how much it meant to some people in Massena, which was so nice for them to come down and congratulate us. When you see how much it meant to them, you've got to believe it means the same here to this community.\" \nThe streak lives on for M-E as the Spartans travel to Section III for a game against Corcoran next week.
