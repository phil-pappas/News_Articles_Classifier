She also was in on a career-high seven blocks, including a career-high two solo.\nAlso today, Hawaii moved up two spots in the Ratings Percentage Index. The Rainbow Wahine (18-1, 8-0 Big West) went from No. 28 to No. 26 in the RPI.\nIn today's AVCA Coaches Top 25, the Wahine remained at No. 8. Leapfrogging Hawaii was Kansas (18-0), which went from No. 9 to No. 7.\nThe top five remained unchanged with USC (20-0) a unanimous No. 1. Following the Women of Troy are Texas (16-1), Nebraska (16-2), Washington (17-1) and Penn State (17-2).\nOhio State (18-2) moved up a spot to No. 6.
