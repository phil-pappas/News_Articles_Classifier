Turbin made his Cleveland debut in Sunday’s overtime loss to Denver, gaining 27 yards on 10 carries. Draughn also handled kickoff return duties earlier this season before he was replaced by Justin Gilbert. \nThe Browns also signed linebacker Jayson DiManche off Kansas City’s practice squad. The 6-foot-1, 245-pounder has appeared in 28 NFL games. He was waived by Cincinnati on Sept. 11. \nCleveland signed tight end Brian Leonhardt to the practice squad and released defensive back Ty Zimmerman. \nLeonhardt was originally signed by Oakland as an undrafted free agent in 2013. He appeared in 12 games and made three starts last season with the Raiders. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:57:31.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
