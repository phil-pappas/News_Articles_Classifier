That's the one I would be most worried about for Sunday's game against the Eagles.\nIt's really not crazy to suggest that Randy Gregory will be as sorely missed as Dez Bryant. Doesn't mean they're the same player. Doesn't mean Gregory, with 18 NFL snaps under his belt, is as talented as the all-pro wide receiver.\nGregory was a late second-round pick who surely would have been taken by someone in the first round -- probably even the middle of that round -- if not for off-the-field concerns and a positive marijuana test at the combine. The promise he showed during the preseason made him an especially important player for Dallas in the first month of the season.\nBecause of suspension, Greg Hardy is ineligible to play until the fifth game against New England in October. The signing of Hardy and the drafting of Gregory were all about upgrading a pass rush that failed the team last season. Jeremy Mincey led the team with six sacks. No one could get to Aaron Rodgers in the second half at Lambeau Field in January.\nWith no Hardy around, the Cowboys hoped Gregory would waste no time making an impact in his NFL career. A player who produced 26 1/2 sacks in 27 starts at Nebraska, Gregory suffered a high ankle sprain against the Giants and won't play for a few weeks.\nDeMarcus Lawrence, last year's second-round pick, has yet to record a regular-season sack. At the end position, that's putting a lot of pressure on Mincey and a much less hyped draft pick -- fifth-rounder Ryan Russell of Purdue -- to get to the quarterback.\nWhy are sacks so important? Isn't this game all about Murray, as much chatter as there has been about him this past week?\nNot likely.\nWhile I expect Murray to do better than he did in his Eagles debut -- eight carries for 9 yards -- the key for the Cowboys is to keep Sam Bradford uncomfortable in the pocket. That's not easy, given how quickly the Eagles get rid of the ball in Chip Kelly's offense. But it's a must.\nThe difference between the Cowboys' win and loss against Philadelphia last year went beyond those Bryant and Murray touchdowns. In the first meeting, the Cowboys' pass rush produced one sack against Mark Sanchez. That led to zero interceptions. That led to an easy Eagles victory.\nIn the rematch in Philadelphia, the Cowboys pressured Sanchez all night. They sacked him four times and intercepted him twice.\nLast week, Bradford threw 52 passes against the Falcons for 336 yards. He was never sacked but he was pressured into two interceptions. That was an odd game because the Falcons attacked the Eagles quickly with Julio Jones.\nThe Cowboys are missing their version of Julio Jones for the next several weeks. Jumping out on the Eagles and grabbing a quick two-touchdown lead will be difficult.\nDallas has to run the ball effectively and has to get the Eagles offense off the field quickly. That requires a pass rush from Mincey, from Lawrence, from Tyrone Crawford and from the depth players.\nThis game starts a four-week stretch against quarterbacks that piled up either 300-yard days or highly productive games in the season opener -- Bradford, then Atlanta's Matt Ryan, the Saints' Drew Brees and finally New England's Tom Brady.\nThe Cowboys won't have Bryant, and they no longer have Murray. Those weapons allowed the team to not only compete but capture the East despite a suspect pass rush in 2014.\nIf the Cowboys can't get after the quarterback the next few weeks better than they did last season, it's only going to magnify what's missing from the offense. Bryant's almost certain to be out more than a month. If Gregory can return in less time than that, it could make a huge difference for this team.\nFor today, defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli has never been quite so challenged to get a big game from his beloved \"rush men.\"\nFollow Tim Cowlishaw on Twitter at @TimCowlishaw.\nCOWBOYS VS.
