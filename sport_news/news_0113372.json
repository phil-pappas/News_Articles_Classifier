The ‎ballot that covers 14 governorates with some 27 million voters ‎opened on Saturday and will close on 28 October.‎\nThe ACPSS figures indicate that the number of legally licensed ‎political parties decreased to 83 in 2015. They were over 100 in ‎‎2012.‎\nAmr Hashem Rabie, an Ahram political analyst, told Ahram ‎Online that \"the political developments in Egypt in the last two ‎years have negatively impacted political parties.\"\n\"This eliminated Islamist political parties such as the ‎Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, while many of ‎the young revolutionary forces that came into being ‎since the removal of former president Hosni Mubarak from office ‎in February 2011 have become far less active,\" said Rabie.‎\n‎‎\"Out of total [44 parties], 13 participated as members of electoral ‎coalitions competing for party-based seats and 31 fielded ‎candidates as independents,\" said Rabie.‎\nThe first stage saw eight electoral coalitions with 240 candidates ‎compete for 60 seats reserved to party-based candidates in ‎two constituencies: the Nile West Delta (with 15 seats) and the ‎North, Middle, and South Upper Egypt (with 45 seats).‎\nIt also saw around 2,573 vie for 226 seats allocated to ‎independents.‎\nThe so-called For the Love of Egypt electoral coalition, widely ‎believed to be supported by Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-‎Sisi, includes some of Egypt's oldest and most active political ‎parties such as the Wafd and the Free Egyptians, headed by ‎business tycoons Al-Sayed Al-Badawi and Naguib Sawiris ‎respectively.‎\nACPSS's statistics also show that Wafd has come on top in ‎terms of number of independent candidates in the first stage. ‎While Wafd has fielded around 300 independents, the Free ‎Egyptians Party has put forward 250.‎\nThe ultraconservative Salafist Nour party, the only Islamist force ‎contesting the polls, decided to compete in one party list ‎constituency – the Nile West Delta – with 15 seats. Nour also ‎fielded around 200 candidates as independents.‎\nThe alliance of the Egyptian Front and the Independence ‎Current was accepted by the High Election Committee -- ‎that is in charge of supervising the polls -- as an electoral ‎coalition with 60 candidates competing in the first stage's two ‎party list constituencies in West Delta and Upper Egypt.‎\nRabie believes that the three factions – the For the Love of ‎Egypt, the Nour and the alliance of the Egyptian Front and the ‎Independence Current – will dominate Egypt's new parliament.‎\nRabie also said that the above statistics clearly show that the ‎performance of secular political parties has become generally ‎weak in the past few years.\n\"It was supposed that the ‎elimination of the two forces which have dominated ‎Egyptian politics since 1980 – Hosni Mubarak's defunct ruling ‎National Democratic Party (NDP) and Muslim Brotherhood – ‎would leave the field wide open for old political forces like the Wafd party or ‎new revolutionary factions like the Constitution Party – to penetrate ‎Egyptian cities and villages and create power bases there, but ‎this has never happened,\" said Rabie, arguing that a \"lack of ‎money, ideological differences and internal divisions have left ‎most of the new political parties completely unable to gain ‎ground in different parts of Egypt.\"‎", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:13:46.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
