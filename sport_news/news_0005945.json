BOX SCORE \n\"The first half of the game, we played well,\" coach Jeff Blashill said. \"Our power play looked real good. We did lots of good stuff. \n\"Then I thought we protected the lead too much in the third. We should have done a little bit better job on the attack. We didn't get on our toes enough, and when we did have time in their end, we didn't do a good enough job of getting pucks to the net.\" \nGustav Nyquist and Brendan Smith scored power play goals. Jimmy Howard had made 35 saves when Joe Colborne tipped Giordano's shot with 1:12 left in regulation. \nMark Giordano beat Howard with a backhand at 3:12 as the Wings got their first real taste of the new 3-on-3 OT format. Teemu Pulkkinen had Detroit's best chance post-regulation. \n\"It was fun, wide open, exactly what you thought was going to happen,\" Howard said of the experience. \nGiordano also had Calgary's first goal, and fired the shot that Joe Colborne tipped with 1:12 left in the third period. \nThe Wings had to play shorthanded after defenseman Mike Green left in the first period with an upper-body injury suffered after a hit from Josh Jooris. They were also without Brad Richards for the first time of the season, as he is sidelined by a sore back . Red Wings' Mike Green suffers injury, status uncertain \n\"First half, we created a lot of offense, our power play was better,\" Henrik Zeterberg said. \"When we started to play with five D, it started to wear on us a little bit. They got more and more momentum and spent more time in our end.\" \nThe Wings made changes up front and on the back end as they prepared for a challenging evening, switching around lines and pairings. \nThe game featured an opponent seeking to end a losing streak against a home team desperate after one victory its first six games. The Wings showed the better moxie from the get-go, running up a 7-4 shot advantage when a power play emerged at the seven-minute mark. \n\"I thought we played well the first period,\" Danny DeKeyser said. \"We were forcing them to take penalties and then we were putting it in the net on the power play.\" \nNyquist scored half a minute into the man advantage, snapping a shot by Hiller as he was screened by Justin Abdelkader. Giordano snuck a wrist shot top shelf from just inside the blue line at 11:02, but when he skated to the penalty box eight seconds later, the Wings made him pay. Smith -- back in the lineup after sitting for two games -- wound up from the blue line, and his shot hit a stick to deflect past Hiller while he was screened this time by Riley Sheahan. \nThe second period wasn't nearly as good -- the Wings had to distribute minutes among the five remaining defensemen, and the Flames worked and skated much harder, especially during two late power plays earned as Kyle Quincey went to the penalty box two straight times. Howard made 16 saves to four by Hiller in the second period alone. \n\"They came with a push and we stayed back a little too much instead of forechecking them like we did in the first two,\" Nyquist said. \nThe Wings came out with more fire to start the third period, with Tomas Tatar sending an early shot at Hiller. A fourth power play boded well, until Pulkkinen ended it after 25 seconds when he tripped Giordano. Howard made a big save on Jooris as the period reached the midpoint, protecting his team's tender lead as the Flames took over and set the pace. Dylan Larkin had a good chance denied with 10 minutes to go, as he attempted a low shot. \nTatar had another great shot denied when he tried from the right side as regulation neared end. The Flames pulled Hiller for the extra attacker, and got the tying goal. \nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com. Follow her on Twitter @helenestjames .
