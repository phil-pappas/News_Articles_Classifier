San Antonio Spurs\nFor the second consecutive year, the Spurs top the Ultimate Rankings.\nSan Antonians live and breath Spurs basketball, and the organization has always been quick to reward their fervor. The Spurs finished No. 1 in fan relations, players, coaching and ownership, plus, you know, they win. A lot.\nWith the splashiest offseason in recent memory and the core back intact, the Spurs should be shooting for a three-peat come next fall.\nPhoto: TOM REEL 1. San Antonio Spurs\nFor the second consecutive year, the Spurs top... Image 2 of 11 2. Memphis Grizzlies\nThis might come as a shock to those unfamiliar with basketball in Bluff City, but Grizzlies fans are as passionate as any around the country. The rise of adopted son Marc Gasol has coincided with the most successful stretch in franchise history, one that has transformed Memphis into a certifiable basketball city.\nFive-straight playoff appearances, a commitment to fan favorites and one of the most affordable experiences in the league have made the Grizz a constant presence at the top of this list.\nPhoto: Getty Images 2. Memphis Grizzlies\nThis might come as a shock to those unfamiliar... Image 3 of 11 3. Tampa Bay Lightning\nThe Lightning rank among the top four in fan relations, affordability, stadium experience and ownership.\nBoasting a pair of 25-year-old franchise cornerstones in Steven Stamkos and Tyler Johnson, Floridians have taken to their ice hockey team in a region that rarely sees any outside of the rink.\nPhoto: Dave Sandford, Getty Images 3. Tampa Bay Lightning\nThe Lightning rank among the top four in fan... Image 4 of 11 No. 4 Anaheim Ducks\nThe Ducks rank first in \"bang for the buck,\" which, in a world where sporting events have become increasingly outpriced for many, means a whole heck of a lot.\nTheir on-ice excellence matters, too: just twice in the last ten seasons has Anaheim failed to reach the playoffs, a run which includes a Stanley Cup in 2007.\nPhoto: DANNY MOLOSHOK, REUTERS No. 4 Anaheim Ducks\nThe Ducks rank first in \"bang for the buck,\"... Image 5 of 11 No. 5 Seattle Seahawks\nThe 12th Man is almost as integral to the Seahawks' brand as the men on the field.\nSeattle has been to two consecutive Super Bowls and boast a roster of beloved players in Russell Wilson, Marshawn Lynch, Earl Thomas and (despite the holdout) Kam Chancellor. Pete Carroll has always had the wacky, fun-loving dad vibe and the stadium is the most raucous is America on any given Sunday.\nThe main issue in Seattle, as with most every NFL team, is affordability. Average cost for a game is $118.69, and that's without factoring in parking ($50), farcical food and drink expenses and ludicrously priced memorabilia. Plus, the Chancellor holdout left a bad taste in everyone's mouth this summer.\nPhoto: TIMOTHY A. CLARY, Getty Images No. 5 Seattle Seahawks\nThe 12th Man is almost as integral to the... Image 6 of 11 No. 6: Green Bay Packers\nSurprisingly, considering the league's dominance, the only other NFL team in top 10 is the Packers.\nAccording to fan rankings, Green Bay boasts the fourth-best stadium experience in sports thanks in large part to over $400 million in recent renovations and repurposing.\nPackers tickets are some of the most difficult to procure in all of sports, but they remain, in NFL terms, remarkably affordable considering the team's run of success. Green Bay's ownership model is also the most unique in all of sports, allowing Cheeseheads to own stock in their team.\nPhoto: Joe Robbins, Getty Images No. 6: Green Bay Packers\nSurprisingly, considering the league's... Image 7 of 11 No. 7: Oklahoma City Thunder\nThis is the one team that could suffer the most drastic drop from this year to the next.\nScott Brooks was fired and replaced by Billy Donovan, who captured two national championships at Florida but possesses zero NBA coaching experience. Looming over all, though, is the possible departure of former MVP Kevin Durant, who becomes an unrestricted free agent this summer.\nPhoto: Alonzo Adams, Alonzo Adams-USA TODAY Sports No. 7: Oklahoma City Thunder\nThis is the one team that could suffer... Image 8 of 11 No. 8: Pittsburgh Pirates\nThis is easily the best stretch of Pirates baseball since the early '90s, and Pittsburgh's Ultimate Ranking reflects that.\nBeautifully situated along the banks of the Allegheny River, PNC Park received the highest stadium rating among fans — it doesn't hurt to put a 98-win team in there, either.\nThe average tickets costs $36.99 per game, well below the MLB average, and when you're paying that much to see 2013 NL MVP Andrew McCutchen, staff ace Gerrit Cole and an eminently affable team, what's to complain about?\nPhoto: Justin K. Aller, Getty Images No. 8: Pittsburgh Pirates\nThis is easily the best stretch of Pirates... Image 9 of 11 No. 9: Arizona Diamondbacks\nAs the Pirates showed, a winning team draws, but so does a middling team with the cheapest seats in the game.\nThe average cost of a Diamondbacks ticket was just $29.56 this season, and the stadium features an array of enticing food (Churro Dog, anyone?) and amenities (outfield pool) to lessen the blow of a losing team.\nArizona hasn't been a perennial playoff contender, but they do boast a strong young core that fans have grown attached to.\nPhoto: Christian Petersen, Getty Images No. 9: Arizona Diamondbacks\nAs the Pirates showed, a winning team... Image 10 of 11 No. 10: Dallas Stars\nDespite just one playoff appearance over the past seven seasons, the Stars entered the top 10 for the first time in franchise history.\nDallas ranks in the top 20 in terms of affordability, fan relations and bang for the buck, and despite missing the playoffs last year, the Stars were a 92-point team right on the cusp.\nThe Stars appear to be an organization on the rise in a city where the representative NFL and NBA teams look to be falling, which might just shoot them even further up the standings next year if they can maintain their part of the bargain.\nPhoto: AP No. 10: Dallas Stars\nDespite just one playoff appearance over the... Image 11 of 11 Spurs headline ESPN's Ultimate Standings 1 / 11 Back to Gallery The heart of San Antonio is Silver & Black.\nFor the second year in a row, the Spurs topped ESPN's Ultimate Standings , a ranking of all 122 franchises in the four major sports leagues as voted on by the fans.\nSan Antonio's beloved Spurs were voted the No. 1 roster in all of sports. Their coach — loved by those who don't have to conduct halftime interviews with him — also ranked No. 1.\nRELATED: 10 things to know from the Spurs' offseason\nThe Spurs' main roster has lived an unnaturally long life together in the NBA, a league where free agency typically means immense roster upheaval.\nTim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili have become ingrained into the culture of San Antonio.\nTheir jerseys fill the streets. Their faces fill murals and portraits and H-E-B commercials. Their names have become the names of new generations of San Antonians.\nGregg Popovich's masterful blend of coaching prowess, commitment to betterment off the court and good-natured demeanor has turned him into a living legend, though he'd grow too uncomfortable at the sound of such praise.\nThe Spurs have also taken on the manner of their coach in becoming one of the more progressive franchises in the sports world.\nBecky Hammon became the first full-time female coach in the NBA under Pops, and she made history this summer by leading San Antonio to a Summer League title in Las Vegas. John Carlos, one of the most prominent athlete activists in the history of the U.S., was also brought in to speak with the team during training camp.\nRELATED: Spurs savor visit from civil rights legend\nIn addition to the on-court excellence and bond the organization has formed with the community, the AT&T Center has received over $100 million in renovations in order to cultivate a more enjoyable, interactive fan experience.\nWith what could be the best roster of the Popovich-Duncan Era, the Spurs appear poised to compete for title No. 6 this season, and if all goes according to plan, a three-peat with the fans.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/23/66/56/5204884/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/11/74/53/2607816/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/30/05/7700816/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/37/07/7467489/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/54/8772409/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/73/30/7058979/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/23/46/51/5139037/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/15/12/74/3452692/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/11/74/53/2607816/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/17/33/6878965/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/30/05/7700816/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/23/46/51/5139037/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/23/66/56/5204884/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/17/33/6878965/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/73/30/7058979/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/54/8772409/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/76/20/7332907/3/920x920.jpg", "http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/13848194/from-san-antonio-spurs-toronto-maple-leafs-all-122-pro-sports-franchises-ranked", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/15/12/74/3452692/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/76/20/7332907/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/37/07/7467489/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:08:01.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
