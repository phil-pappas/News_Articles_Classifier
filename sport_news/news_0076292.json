Mexico Wins CONCACAF Cup 3-2 After Extra Time The United States and Mexico played in a single match to decide the representative for CONCACAF at the 2017 FIFA Confederation Cup in Russia Privacy Policy | More Newsletters The United States and Mexico play at the Rose Bowl in front of 93,723 fans at the CONCACAF Cup on October 10, 2015 PASADENA, Ca -- In front of 93,723 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Mexico defeated the United States 3-2 after extra time of the CONCACAF Cup on Saturday night, securing a spot in Russia at the Confederations Cup in 2017. Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez scored the game's opening goal just shy of 10 minutes when Oribe Peralta slipped behind the defense on the right side and played a square ball to his teammate. With United States goal keeper Brad Guzan beaten by the pass, Hernandez put Mexico up 1-0. — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) October 11, 2015 About five minutes later, the United States equalized from a set piece. U.S. captain Michael Bradley put in a dangerous free kick from the right wing, and defender Geoff Cameron met the ball with his head. Save for a bit of pushing and shoving, the first half expired without incident with the teams level at 1-1. — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) October 11, 2015 The second half featured Mexico controlling possession and battering the U.S. goal, but the visitors were unable to break the deadlock. Hernandez had the best opportunity when he found himself open in front of goal, but his back heel flick failed to hit the target. — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) October 11, 2015 After 90 minutes, the teams remained level, so the match called for another 30 minutes of extra time to break the deadlock. In the first extra time period, Mexico took the lead when Peralta latched onto a ball in the center of the box and hit home. Mexico led 2-1 at halftime of extra time, but the final 15 minutes had to be played. Peralta makes it 2-1 to Mexico! #USAvMEX pic.twitter.com/QyQEASiVIf — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) October 11, 2015 If the United States managed to level in the final 15 minutes, the game would go to extra time. Sure enough, the United States leveled with two substitutes combining. DeAndre Yedlin used his superior pace up the right side and found striker Bobby Wood, who managed to beat Mexico goal keeper Moises Munoz. — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) October 11, 2015 At that stage, both teams had the opportunity to win in the final 10-odd minutes. Neither team packed it in to play for penalty kicks, but the United States appeared the more likely side to find a winner before the game went to penalties until Mexico's Paul Aguilar found the sweet spot on a volley in the 118th minute. — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) October 11, 2015 Suddenly, Mexico led 3-2, and this time, the United States would not be coming back. Time ran out, and Mexico won the CONCACAF Cup.
