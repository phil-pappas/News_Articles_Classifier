Is there a good penalty prize? – Judy, Rocky River\nYes. But it varies by position. For a Browns defensive back, you get to cover Dwayne Bowe in the next practice.\nBud: Jumping offsides on the potential game-winning field goal try is the worst play we've seen since 1999! -- The Dwayne Rudd Backers Organization\nDon't lose your head now.\nBud: Dwayne Bowe is stealing from the Browns! – A. Rison, Atlanta, Ga.\nAs I remember, one of your better tries, sir.\nBud: I gave up my Browns season tickets of 29 years in 1991, at the end of the Bud Carson regime.
