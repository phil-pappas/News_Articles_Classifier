I will never forget. I was there targeting signatures.\" \nHabana said he and his brother were so keen to get Lomu's signature that they chased him into the restrooms. \n\"Me and my brother actually had to run into the bathroom where Jonah was, in a public area, and get his â€” again an unbelievable amount of respect for the way he changed the game, what he gave to the game, even more so for what he meant to the game.\" \nHabana was meters from having the Rugby World Cup record in his own right, too, but knocked on near the line against the Americans. He'll get another chance when South Africa lines up in the quarterfinals against the loser of Saturday's Australia versus Wales game in Pool A. The Australians ended South Africa's run in the quarterfinals in 2011 in New Zealand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:23:50.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
