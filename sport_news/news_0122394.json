Vidarbha bowlers were giving it there all but hardly getting any assistance from the Jamtha wicket for the last two days. In fact, there were very few balls that popped up or kept low from good length.\n\"As the day progressed, the wicket got on a slower side. There wasn't much purchase or carry for the fast bowlers at all. It was spinning...one odd spin here and there but on a slower side. You got to get different kind of wickets and be able to bowl on such wickets. Overall, I am happy with the way we performed. I think we dominated all four days and that's important for me. We were ready to bowl till the end, we tried our best and that's all we could do,\" Vidarbha coach Paras Mhambrey said.\nMhambrey would have loved to have six or seven points under his kitty. Odisha have one of the weaker batting line-ups in Group 'A' of Ranji Trophy but the dead Jamtha wicket meant Vidarbha had to content with three points.\n\"The wicket conditions aren't in our control. But the positives I can take from this game was the way we played. We batted very well, someone like Umesh Yadav scoring a hundred coming in at No.9 was a special effort. The bowlers did well even though there wasn't much of the help for them. Ravi Thakur chipped in with crucial wickets on this kind of track. Our spinners were ready to bowl a long spell. Akshay (Wakhare) was brilliant, Ravi (Jangid) was also good,\" he said.\nYadav scored a century but went wicketless but that didn't bother Mhambrey, who feels the Indian pacer bowled well but didn't get any assistance from the pitch. \"I am satisfied with the way he bowled. Obviously when you look at the wicket, it won't reflect the way he has bowled. It was a dead track, no bounce, nothing for fast bowlers. He bowled in good areas. There are certain points we have spoken about during India 'A' series. If you look at the Sri Lankan series, he bowled brilliantly and that shows he was shaping well. The rhythm was good, the carry was good. He bowled consistently in good areas and swung the ball at 140 (km/hr) plus. So that's a good sign. As a bowler, he needs to be little more consistent. If he does that, he can pick up lot more wickets,\" he signed off.
