(AP Photo/David Richard, File) \nCLEVELAND (AP) — Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel is active for Sunday’s game despite being involved in a domestic incident this past week. \nManziel will back up starter Josh McCown as the Browns host the unbeaten Denver Broncos. \nManziel acknowledged to police that he drank alcohol on Monday before the former Heisman Trophy winner and his girlfriend, Colleen Crowley, were questioned after they were involved in a heated argument on the highway. According to a police report, Manziel was driving at a high rate of speed and passed cars on the shoulder before police were called. \nManziel was not arrested. \nThe Browns released a statement Friday saying they had spoken to Manziel about his behavior. However, the team did not exclude him from Sunday’s game. \nThe incident raised concerns about Manziel, who spent 70 days in a rehab facility during the offseason for an unspecified condition. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:52:58.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
