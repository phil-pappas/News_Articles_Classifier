Blast occurs in Roorkee when I reach there. I get threat letters by terrorist organizations. UP Government keeps framing me in one bogus case to another. But no one cares,\" Som said.\nHe further stated that media too has played a destructive role in this regard.\n\"Today, despite being a staunch Hindu I am being accused of being director of a slaughter house. I had purchased a land in 2009 and sold it six months later. The land was in the name of a company, Al Dua Food Processing Pvt Ltd. I, by default became one of the directors of the company that did not exist on ground. When I sold it, I ceased to be the director. Now media is unnecessarily twisting the facts stating that I wanted to run a slaughter house,\" the leader further added.\nSamajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Thursday had blamed those accused in Muzaffarnagar riots to be responsible for Dadri incident in Bisada village. On the allegations, the firebrand BJP leader said, \"Rahul Gandhi went to Dadri followed by Owaisi and Arvind Kejriwal. I went much later but why only targeting me? I am a public representative. If I meet people there, does that mean I perpetrated or instigated violence? All this is so illogical.\"\nHe further stated that UP Government in its attempt to hide its own incompetence simply blame Sangeet Som for all the ills in the state.\n\"Even all the charges slapped against me in Muzaffarnagar riots were false. This is evident from the fact that police has not been able to frame a single chargesheet against me\", he said.\nMeanwhile, BJP has distanced itself from Sangeet Som's Bisada village visit. UP State President of BJP, Laxmikant Bajpai, told TOI, \"Sangeet Som should not have gone there. But now that he has visited the Dadri village it was in his personal capacity. Party has nothing to do with his visit.\"\nWhen Som was asked to comment on the issue, he said, \"I am not aware of what the state president said about me. I went to Bisada in the capacity of a BJP worker and nothing else.\"\nIn the past, Som has courted several controversies that included matter related to his fake academic degree. Then his father was booked for assaulting a brick-kiln worker. During Muzaffarnagar riots, NSA was slapped against him for inciting crowd that led to riots.
