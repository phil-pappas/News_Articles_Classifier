The Dolphins blew out a second straight opponent during the Dan Campbell era, and did it in convincing fashion scoring 41-points in the first half before taking their foot off the gas in the second half. Campbell, who replaced Joe Philbin as Miami's interim head coach three weeks ago, has injected toughness into what was once viewed as a soft NFL team. Miami owned the line of scrimmage against a physical team for the second straight game. It'll be interesting to see if Miami can play, and win with this style of football in New England on Thursday night. \n\nChris Perkins Dolphins Writer Dan Campbell, the most muscular, aggressive, and interesting interim coach in franchise history, has his guys believing, and that makes a huge difference. They're blocking, tackling, and kicking butt. Excellent victory for the players, coaches and fans. Now it's on to New England. \n\nDave Hyde Sports Columnist Where do you want to start? The 41-0 halftime score? The defense that again had four, first-half sacks? Dan Campbell again made a case that energy, leadership and coaching can change a professional team's culture overnight. \n\nDavid Selig Sports Editor This was clearly the biggest win over the Texans in Dolphins history. (OK, so it was their first.) But you can forget all that history stuff. This is the Dan-tallica era, and nobody is safe. It will be interesting to see how these newly reborn Dolphins handle an opponent outside the dreadful AFC South. We won't have long to wait to find out, and suddenly Thursday night's game in New England has a bit of intrigue. \n\nKeven Lerner Online Sports Editor Against two woeful teams, the Dolphins looked like the high-octane model most expected at the beginning of the season. Among the many players who have made an impact for Dan Campbell against Tennessee and Houston, Cameron Wake has been the biggest difference-maker. \nSteve Svekis Multimedia Reporter With a sliver less than 16 minutes gone in the game, the Dolphins had outgained Houston 275-0 in the yardage book and 28-0 on the scoreboard, erasing the last team that had never lost to Miami. Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake killed Houston's offensive line. Amazingly after the 1-3 start, the season is far from done heading into Miami's 10-game season-ending gauntlet, which starts Thursday night in Foxboro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:13:51.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
