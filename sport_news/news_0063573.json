Jacob deGrom had been an option to starting on short rest, but he threw a season-high 121 pitches Friday. \nManager Terry Collins also indicated deGrom would likely only be an option if the Mets were trailing in the series, 2-1, saying he doesn’t think he’d bring him back on short rest if the Mets are leading the best-of-five series. Game 3 is Monday night at Citi Field. \n\"I think it would be a better scenario to see how [deGrom] is on Sunday and Monday to make that determination and what happens with us,\" Collins said before Saturday night’s loss. \"[Friday] after that many pitches and had he not worked so hard early in the game … I think it’s unrealistic right now he would be the Game 4 pitcher.\" \nBIG GAME: Matt Harvey starts Monday in his first outing since he arrived late to the team’s first workout of the playoffs, and Collins expects Harvey to deliver a good outing. \nIt will be Harvey’s first postseason start. \n\"The one thing we all know about society, people have short memories when you’re out there having success and you see it in sports. It’s one of the great things in sports — you can make a mistake and then go out and perform and people forget all about it,\" Collins said. \"Go do your job. I think that’s why it will be good to have him get out there.\" \nLEARNING: Ex-Met and current Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner credited David Wright for helping his development. \n\"He’s the ultimate professional,\" Turner said. \n\"I think the amazing thing about him is here’s there and he does it every single day.\" \nTurner was with the Mets from 2010-13 before they non-tendered him. Turner, who came up to the big leagues in 2009 with the Orioles, has enjoyed his best seasons with the Dodgers. \n\"He’s the ultimate professional,\" Turner said of Wright. \nGAME 2 MOVES: Michael Conforto started in left field in place of Michael Cuddyer. … Daniel Murphy moved up to the third spot in the order; Yoenis Cespedes hit cleanup. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:22:02.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
