Instead, Seattle safety Kam Chancellor knocked the ball free inside the 1-yard line, and the Lions saw their first win bounce out of the back of the end zone along with the football as they fell, 13-10.\nBOX SCORE: Seahawks 13, Lions 10 \nThe Lions fell to 0-4 and are the last team in the NFL without a victory. The Bears, Saints and Ravens all won this week.\nBesides a few ill-timed errors, the Lions defense had a tremendous effort with six sacks — including two by Ezekiel Ansah — and three fumble recoveries, the first time the team has done that since 2004. But, as had been the case in the first three games, the Lions' offense was stagnant for too long.\nQuarterback Matthew Stafford was 24 of 35 for 203 yards, and the Lions ran for just 53 yards. A 3-for-13 mark on third downs along with some bad penalties bit the Lions once again.\nThe Lions defense played well in the first half, but as has been the case this season, untimely errors proved costly. After a scoreless first quarter, the Lions appeared to have the Seahawks stopped on a third-and-12 in Seattle territory as defensive end Jason Jones looked to have an easy sack.\nInstead, Wilson slipped out of Jones' grasp, evaded the diving Ansah and threw to wide receiver Jermaine Kearse for a 34-yard gain. On the next play, Wilson hit receiver Doug Baldwin for a 24-yard touchdown, giving the Seahawks a 7-0 lead with 10:56 left in the second quarter.\nTo their credit, the Lions responded with their best drive of the first half with the top play being a 17-yard pass to receiver Lance Moore on a fake screen. However, after reaching the Seattle 23, two incomplete passes forced the Lions to settle for a field goal, a 41-yard make by Matt Prater that made it 7-3 with 5:16 left in the first half.\nThe Seahawks, though, continued moving on their next drive as three plays of at least 15 yards helped them reach the Detroit 9, but the Lions' defense thrived with its back against the wall. On first-and-goal, Ansah sacked Wilson for a 9-yard loss, and a false start on second down pushed the Seahawks back further. On third-and-goal from the 22, Jones and Devin Taylor sacked Wilson.\nThe negative plays weren't enough to keep the Seahawks from scoring as Steven Hauschka made a 51-yard field goal to give them a 10-3 lead with a minute left in the first half.\nThe Lions had time to answer, but after a 13-yard pass to Riddick on the first play of the ensuing drive, Stafford threw three straight incompletions as the Lions' deficit remained 7 at the break.\nThe Seahawks' offense carried its momentum into the third quarter as Wilson again made some dazzling plays. As they did late in the second quarter, though, the Lions defense made some plays after Seattle crossed midfield to force a field goal. Hauschka's 52-yard attempt was good, extending the Seahawks lead to 13-3 with 11:11 left in the third quarter.\nMeanwhile, a Lions offense that gained just 129 yards in the first half continued to struggled, gaining just 26 yards and failing to convert a third down in the third quarter.\nOnce again, the defense bailed out the offense in the fourth quarter for the biggest play of the game. On a third-and-4, strong safety James Ihedigbo forced another fumble by Wilson, and defensive tackle Caraun Reid grabbed the ball and returned it for a 27-yard touchdown, cutting the deficit to 13-10 with 8:32 left.\nOn the next drive, the Lions forced a three-and-out as Ihedigbo sniffed out a third-down run, and their opportunity to take the lead began at their own 9-yard line, after returner TJ Jones muffed the punt and momentarily had possession in the end zone.\nFinally, the offense moved the ball effectively. On third-and-6, Stafford hit Golden Tate for a short pass that he turned into a 22-yard gain. After three more positive plays, Stafford threw a beautiful pass to tight end Tim Wright for a 26-yard gain that moved the Lions into the red zone for the first time with less than 3 minutes remaining.\nAfter two runs by Zach Zenner totaling 9 yards, the Lions appeared to have a score on a short throw to Johnson, but Chancellor forced a fumble to turn it into a touchback and essentially the victory with 1:45 remaining.\nIn addition to the devastating loss, the Lions suffered several injuries. In the first half, tight end Eric Ebron (left knee) exited and did not return. Linebacker Travis Lewis (ankle) and defensive tackle Haloti Ngata (calf) exited early in the third quarter and did not return.\nDefensive tackle Tyrunn Walker (ankle) needed a cart to leave the field after suffering an injury in the fourth quarter and was ruled out almost immediately.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:34:07.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
