The case has called into question how the school handled the sexual assault and Ukwuachu's transfer into the program. \nSince the sexual assault case surfaced, University of Texas football Head Coach Charlie Strong has voiced his opinion on the university's handling of the transfer. He said a coach has to do their research on the transferring player. He also added that a culture of disrespect toward women should not be allowed on the coach's part. \nAfter Ukwuachu serves his six-month sentence, he will be on probation for 10 years. If he violates the probation, he will be sent to prison for eight years.
