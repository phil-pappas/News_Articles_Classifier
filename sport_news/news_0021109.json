Advertisement MLB: Astros beat Royals, 4-2   \nHOUSTON - What can't Dallas Keuchel do at home? \nOn Sunday, in front of a rowdy sellout crowd of 42, 674 at Minute Maid Park, Keuchel tossed arguably one of his most impressive performances of the year leading his team to a 4-2 victory against the Royals. \n\"We have a lot of playmakers on this team that can change the course of a game with one swing or one pitch,\" Keuchel said. \"And just no we're getting into the playoffs and getting on that national stage. It's a lot, it's a shock to a lot of people but it's been there.\" \nAfter giving up an early home run to Lorenzo Cain, Keuchel settled in, allowing his team to make a comeback. \nIn the fifth down 1-0, Jason Castro ripped a one-out single through the right side of the infield, driving in Luis Valbuena and Chris Carter, making it 2-1 Astros. \nEntering this game Castro had yet to get a hit in the postseason, going 0-for-8 at the dish thus far, but came through at the perfect time. \n\"Valbuena and Carter kind of set the stage and made that situation possible,\" Castro said. \"But I was trying to get a pitch out over just to put something in play in the middle of the field, just to get at least one run in. And fortunately got through and we got both. \n\"But it was nice, good time to get my first hit in the postseason, that's for sure.\" \nHouston wouldn't look back. \nIn the sixth with two outs, Gomez singled to center, driving in Colby Rasmus, driving the lead up to 3-1 for the Astros. \nThat would end the night for Royals starter Edison Volquez (0-1) who finished going 5.2 innings, allowing three runs on five hits, while striking out eight and walking four. \n\"I mean a lot of times you get in those situations and if he's struggling or he's fighting, his command or pitch count's up, he's had some really intense innings,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said about Volquez. \"You might get into a situation where you'll make a change there. But I thought Eddie was throwing the ball great. I thought he was superb.\" \nWhile Houston was ramping up its offense, Keuchel was dealing. \nKeuchel (2-0) stayed in for a full seven innings, pitching around base runners and avoiding the big mistake, allowing the lone run on five hits, while walking three and striking out seven. \nWith the win, Keuchel joined Mike Scott as the only other pitcher in Astros history to win in each of his firs two postseason starts. Scott won the 1986 NCLS Game 1 and Game 4. \nIn the seventh Carter, who finished a triple shy of the cycle, launched the first pitch he saw to left field for the final run of the night, making it 4-1. \n\"I don't know what has been different, but I've been getting pitches up in the zone and not missing them,\" Carter said on recent success. \"That's probably been the biggest thing for me.\" \nBefore it was all said and done, Alex Gordon made it interesting in the ninth wit a solo shot to left, but that's all the Royals could muster. \nWith the win the Astros grab a 2-1 lead in the ALDS, and now could clinch a trip to the American League Championship Series with a win on Monday. \n\"We have got good players and we got a good team, and I've often kind of downplayed a little bit of how good that we feel like we can be or how good that these guys are coming up in the moments,\" Astros manager AJ Hinch said. \"And to watch guys flourish in some high pressure, high intense - only game on today, until later, and those coming out parties for a club is good.\" \nAstros will send Lance McCullers to the mound on Monday for the potential series-clinching victory. First pitch is set for 12:07 p.m. at Minute Maid Park. \nBox Score \nTeam 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 R H E L \nRoyals 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 7 0 9 \nAstros 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 X 4 8 1 6 \nWP: Dallas Keuchel (2-0)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:25:00.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
