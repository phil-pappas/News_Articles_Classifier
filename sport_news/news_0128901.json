(Photo: File photo) \nThe highly anticipated Michigan vs. Michigan State will kick off at 3:30 p.m. on Oct. 17 at Michigan Stadium. \nThe network will be announced next week, likely depending on the result of the Michigan-Northwestern game. If the Wolverines win, there's a chance for a larger national audience with two Top 15 teams. \nWith the 5-0 Spartans ranked No. 4 in the Associated Press poll and the 4-1 Wolverines at No. 18, this has the potential to be the highest-ranked matchup in years. \nU-M was No. 23 and MSU was No. 24 in 2013 -- MSU's 29-6 win in East Lansing -- but the last time the two were both ranked in the Top 20 was 2010 when U-M was 18 and MSU 17. The Spartans also won that game, 34-17. ABC, ESPN or ESPN2 will televise Michigan State&#39;s Oct. 17 game at Michigan, with kickoff set for 3:30 pm ET. (TV network TBD after Oct. 10). â€” Spartan Football (@MSU_Football) October 5, 2015 Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1Le397T TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:29:13.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
