The family is not expected to be displaced.\nThree occupants, two dogs and a parrot safely evacuated without injury thanks to the family rescue dog and the working smoke alarms, fire officials said.\nAs a reminder, AFD, BCFD and Red Cross have joined forces on a free smoke alarm distribution & install project.
