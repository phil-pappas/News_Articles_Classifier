But the Tigers clawed back to tie it at 14, 21, 24 to end regulation and 38 in overtime. Back and forth play in overtime ended with Ricardo Louis dropping a sure touchdown in the fourth overtime, which would have setup a potential game-tying two-point conversion. Louis was the target on the game's final play. \nKEY MOMENT Daniel Carlson made a 41-yard field goal to tie the game at 24 at the end of regulation, keeping Auburn alive for a four-overtime slugfest that proved too much. \nWHAT THE FANS ARE SAYING This team has a mental toughness to respond in tough situations. From the Jacksonville State game to Kentucky, to being down 14-0, 21-14, 24-21 and multiple times in overtime on Saturday, Auburn has been able to respond. However the Tigers could have, and perhaps should have, avoided many of those situations. If they did, the season might be far different. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? \nGray King had two receptions for 13 yards. It was the sophomore's first career catches. The walk-on wide receiver was thrust into the rotation after Stanton Truitt went down with a shoulder injury. King had a four-yard catch when Sean White was hit as he threw and later had a nine-yard grab for a third-down conversion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:51:19.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
