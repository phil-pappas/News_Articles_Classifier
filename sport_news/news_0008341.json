(AP) — The Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas CityRoyals are sticking with the same 25-man rosters they used to advance out of the last round of the playoffs for their AL Championship Series. \nThe rosters were due before the start of Game 1 on Friday night at Kauffman Stadium. \nToronto manager John Gibbons indicated Thursday there wouldn’t be much different, if anything, from the squad he used against Texas. That means left-hander Aaron Loup is part of the roster after he missed the final two games of the divisional round with a family issue. \nThe Royals decided to keep speedster Terrance Gore and outfield substitute Paulo Orlando on the roster they used against Houston. That means Jonny Gomes will remain off the roster. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:46:45.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
