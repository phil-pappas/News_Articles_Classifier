UEFA leaders were meeting Thursday Oct. 15, 2015 to decide whether to continue backing Michel Platini, with some not yet satisfied by his explanation for a payment that led to his 90-day FIFA suspension. (AP Photo/Sang Tan) \nEngland has suspended its backing of Michel Platini’s FIFA presidential bid after discovering new information about the payment which led to his suspension from world soccer. \nThe English Football Association was one of the first federations to publicly endorse Platini’s campaign in July and now becomes the first to distance itself from the UEFA president. \nThe ethics case centers on 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) Platini received from FIFA in 2011. He says the money was unpaid additional salary from his job as Blatter’s adviser between 1998 and 2002. \nThe FA says it received “more information” on the case from Platini’s lawyer at Thursday’s UEFA meeting. \nAs a result, the FA board decided Friday that “it must suspend its support” of Platini’s candidacy.
