Monroe Central’s lead could have been much larger than the 6-0 one it held, and little mistakes were keeping Anderson Prep close. \nEarly in the second quarter, Israel Nash changed that. \nHe jumped a slant pass and returned the interception 37 yards for the touchdown, igniting his team that went on to win the game 60-14, the first game of the sectional for Monroe Central. Monroe Central hosts Tri-Central next Friday. \n\"Our offensive line, there's a really good bond between them and the rest of the team,\" Monroe Central fullback Jansen Blevins said. \"Everything flowed well tonight, I saw them improve from last week.\" \nAlmost instantly, the Golden Bears offense picked up. Logan Conklin had already scored on an eight-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, but power back Jansen Blevins tore off a 36-yard touchdown run halfway through the second quarter. Blevins finished with 156 rushing yards on the night with three touchdowns. \nAnderson Prep quarterback Triston Anderson showed poise and an accurate arm but was hampered by a leaky offensive line that forced him to consistently scramble. As a result, Anderson Prep gave Monroe Central the ball back with 41 seconds left in the first half, enough time to march downfield and allow Conklin to find Nash for a 10-yard touchdown with time expiring, making the lead 30-0. \n“Everyone keeps getting better, we keep playing harder, it's a team thing and we're all together right now,\" Blevins said. \nTyler Writtenhouse wasted no time making an impact in the second half, taking a handoff 72 yards for a touchdown, before Blevins punched a run into the end zone just minutes later. \nMonroe Central’s offensive line overpowered the Anderson Prep defensive line at will, opening up holes that let runners sprint untouched, as Wyatt Snyder took off for a 57-yard touchdown, before Blevins scored for a third time, giving his team a 60-0 lead. \nAnderson Prep tacked on two touchdowns late, both passes from Triston Anderson to Jacob Anderson, one for 11 yards and the other for 79 yards. \nContact prep sports reporter David Polaski at (765) 213-2848.
