(AP Photo/Gail Burton) \nWith the MLB regular season in the books, we finally have the full tally of time saved from the new pace of play rules adopted for the 2015 season. \nIn short: Games were six minutes shorter on average. \nFrom the AP : Major League Baseball managed to cut six minutes from the average time of a nine-inning game this season, when it adopted some speedup rules. Stats LLC said Monday that the season average came in at 2 hours, 56 minutes. While the average dropped to 2:53 in the first half of the season, it was back at 3:00 after the All-Star break. \nIt doesn't seem like a lot, but really adds up over the course of the season. In total, the average MLB season took up 972 fewer minutes (or 16.2 hours hours). If you sleep eight hours a night and watch every baseball game, you basically got a day of your life back. \nIn truth, it's a minor boon for fans in exchange for a headache for players who struggled to adapt, particularly David Ortiz , who said he \"might run out of money\" due to the fines he'd face from ignoring pace of play rules. \nDespite his initial resistance, Ortiz (and other MLB vets) eventually conformed to the pace of play rules, namely the one that forces hitters to keep at least one foot in the box at all times during an at-bat. \nSix minutes may not seem like much, but does mean the new rules did offset most instances where instant replay may have caused delays -- at least on a broader scale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:02:19.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
