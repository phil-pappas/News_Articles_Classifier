The building is painted red and blue and has been known for 60 years as the Wagon Wheel, although no one calls it that.\nThe place is simply the Wheel, and its owner, a jovial 49-year-old Kansas alumnus whose full name is Robert Farha, is known around town as Knobbie. The Wheel serves $3 cans of Coors and $5 wang burgers (basically bacon cheeseburgers with a fried egg on top).\nThe Wheel has 15 televisions mounted above walls of sports memorabilia, making it a hopping place to hang out shoulder to shoulder before, during and after Jayhawks basketball games. Kansas football games, however, are a different story.\nThis is not good news for Farha’s business. Farha practically blanched when word reached Lawrence that an Orlando bar, the Basement, would offer free beer until Central Florida, which lost its first six games, won a game.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage College Football Games to Watch on Saturday OCT. 16, 2015 To Craft Michigan’s Miserly Defense, a Coordinator Gives All OCT. 16, 2015 Shilique Calhoun Finds a Good Fit in Michigan State’s Pass Rush OCT. 15, 2015 In Southeastern Conference, Nothing’s Bigger Than Texas A&M’s Field OCT. 14, 2015 “I’d go broke,” Farha said, smiling.\nPhoto Robert Farha, the owner of the Wheel, said he was “hoping for two or three wins next season.” Credit Christopher Smith for The New York Times The Jayhawks are as inept in football as they are talented in basketball. Their 66-7 home loss to Baylor a week ago dropped them to 0-5. Their 38-13 loss the previous Saturday at Iowa State was their 35th straight defeat away from home — and that game had been thought to give the Jayhawks their best chance of winning this year.\nNevertheless, Knobbie, who graduated in 1988, stays true blue (and red) to K.U. He planned to open three hours before Saturday’s home game against Texas Tech, a four-touchdown favorite. About 50 people had dropped by the Wheel before the Baylor game, but most were alumni who cleared out before halftime. The students were on fall break. Many went to Las Vegas.\nCampus Corner A look at some of the well-known and not-so-well-known college football traditions on campuses across the country.
