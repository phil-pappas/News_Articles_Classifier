By KEVIN DRULEY - kdruley@shawmedia.com \nConfident North keeps rolling \nVolley for the Cure Night and Clinch the Upstate Eight Conference River Division Night coincided for St. Charles North on Tuesday. \nAs one North Stars veteran tells it, dovetailing the two was almost elementary. \n\"We knew what was on the line and we really came out,\" senior right side/setter Jaclyn Taylor said. \"We've been really focusing on not having such a slow start because that's been a trend to our season. The atmosphere was great and that's what we thrive off of, and that got us going from point one.\" \nNorth shared the league crown in 2014 but has staggered each of its River opponents this fall, namely fellow contenders St. Charles East (Tuesday) and Geneva (Sept. 8) in two sets. \nEntering the season, it was no secret North would rely on its senior core of Taylor, outside hitters Claire Anderson and Daley and defensive specialist Sam Lappin, who each have shared a court since their youth. \nSo far, so good. \n\"This year, I feel like it's our last shot to play together,\" Taylor said. \"We just want to end on a strong note, especially with coach (Lindsey) Hawkins. We're all really close with her, so we just want to make sure it's the best one yet.\" \nPlayoff anticipation \nIHSA postseason pairings are set to be released at 4 p.m. today. \nOne of the more suspenseful announcements figures to be St. Francis' placement in its first Class 4A draw. The Spartans, who have won the past three 3A titles, were bumped up in class this fall, although the transition hardly has fazed veteran coach Peg Kopec. \n\"You get cards every year. A different set of cards every year,\" Kopec said. \"It's true. You try to put them together so that they are able to utilize their best talents, plus teach them some new things. That's a coach's job.\" \nSt. Francis already knows it will be a regional host in the East Aurora Sectional, a distinction shared by St. Charles East. \nWaubonsie Valley and Plainfield North also are regional hosts within the sectional complex, whose 22 teams include Batavia, Geneva and St. Charles North. \n\"We know wherever we land we're going to have to work just as hard,\" Taylor said, \"because there are a lot of good teams in the sectional.\" \nIn 3A, Kaneland and Burlington Central both have been assigned to the Sycamore Sectional, albeit in different sub sectionals. Rosary is part of the 3A Glenbard South Sectional. \nRoyal pains, postseason gains? \nRosary and St. Francis met for the first time as Girls Catholic Athletic Conference rivals on Tuesday, but the differences in the longstanding rivalry didn't stop there in Royals coach Rachel Hartmann's view. \n\"We hung with Francis at times, but overall, I think it was kind of an uneventful match,\" Hartmann said of Rosary's 25-19, 25-18 road loss. \"There wasn't a ton of rallies or huge plays. The gym kind of felt somewhat quiet, which at Francis is unusual.\" \nJoining the GCAC after the incremental dissolution of the Suburban Christian Conference introduced numerous new opponents to the Royals' schedule. Before St. Francis, Rosary lost to Loyola and Mother McAuley. \nHovering around .500, Rosary awaits several more traditionally tough foes at this weekend's Mizuno Cup, hosted by East at the Great Lakes Center in Aurora. The Royals share a pool with Lincoln-Way East and Wheaton Warrenville South. \n\"It's a great tournament, lots of great teams that play, so it'll be interesting to see,\" Hartmann said. \"We've had a few tough losses in a row here, so the competition is going to stay high even this weekend. So we'll be challenged, but I hope to see the girls respond in a good way.\" \n– Kevin Druley, kdruley@shawmedia.com \nClaire Anderson \nSt. Charles North, sr., OH \nWhat she did: Anderson smacked 10 kills to key Tuesday's 25-23, 25-13 home sweep of St. Charles East, which clinched the Upstate Eight Conference River Division title for the North Stars. \nGeneva's front line \nWhat happened: The trio of Ally Barrett, Grace Loberg and Ally Mullen combined for 21 kills in Tuesday's 25-18, 25-19 sweep of Batavia. \nHITTING REWIND \nThose who root, root, root for the home team went home happy during Tuesday's respective Tri-Cities rivalry matches, as St. Charles North and Geneva pulled out victories against those respective you-know-whos. Tuesday could go down as one of the busier non-weekend sports dates in these parts in recent memory. Boys golf regionals and the Tri-Cities Night boys soccer doubleheader games also were contested. \nCOMING ATTRACTION \nImpactful regular season matches and weekend tournaments still remain, but today's postseason pairing announcements signify the beginning of the stretch run. Regionals begin the week of Oct. 26, with teams vying for a spot in the four-class state tournament held Nov. 13-14 at Illinois State's Redbird Arena in Normal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:50:58.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
