Comment By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News   By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 8:00 PM By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 8:00 PM When Ron Sudmyer interviewed for the interim athletic director’s job at Holliston High and didn’t get it, he understood. A more experienced guy, Matt Baker, was hired. Sudmyer, 66, was in semi-retirement anyway. Still, his resume glittered with his experience in many facets of the high school environment. He had spent 36 years as a teacher and coach in Framingham, rising to high school vice principal, a position he held for 10 years, until 2008. He needed to keep busy though. Last year he was interim assistant principal at Ashland High, and has evaluated student-teachers during their internships at Framingham State University and Brandeis. Sudmyer, who lives in Framingham, still had plenty on his plate. There would be one more thing coming around the bend. It began when Sudmyer bumped into Framingham High hockey coach Paul Spear on the Cape. Spear told him that Framingham might be looking for an AD, with Gary Doherty stepping down and returning to the classroom while remaining the Flyers’ head football coach. Sudmyer was recently hired, returning to the school where he’d worked for more than half of his life. It’s a temporary position right now, with the administration expecting to have a full-time AD by the spring. Could it be Sudmyer? “I’m not thinking about that right now,” he said, before adding, “I’d talk about it. Let’s see where it goes.” Meanwhile, the job is to make changes as fast as possible. “What a beautiful thing high school athletics can be if it’s done the right way,” said Sudmyer. “It’s an advantage still knowing a lot of people here, but the job is complex. You need someone (in the AD’s office) full-time. I can see where it’d be difficult for Gary to be football coach and athletic director. “Gary’s been great, offering me assistance and support.” In a message to parents and boosters Sudmyer said, “While winning will always be important as long as a scoreboard exists, we all know there are more important and enduring lessons to be learned from participation in athletics.” Near the top of the list would be the “trust that our coaches and administrators have the best interest of your child in mind.” Sudmyer has officiated high school basketball and football games for 23 years, and umpired Cape Cod Baseball League games. “I still have a lineup card with Jason Varitek’s name on it. I umpired games when Lou Merloni was playing at the Cape. I had Lou in class in Framingham.” Last Saturday, Sudmyer was scheduled to officiate the Dexter-Proctor football game then head to Framingham State University for the Framingham-Braintree Bay State Conference football game. Obviously, Sudmyer won’t be allowed to officiate any more BSC games. He’s assigned mostly Dual County League games. On Sunday morning, he officiated three Pop Warner games in Norton. Page 2 of 2 - So how’s that semi-retirement going, Ron? He’s worked several high school Super Bowls at Gillette Stadium, the most memorable being the 2013 matchup between undefeated Reading and Natick which wasn’t decided until the last play of the game when Natick’s Troy Flutie unleashed a long bomb to the end zone. A Hail Mary from a kid named Flutie? “I thought, ‘Where have I seen that before?’” said Sudmyer. Alas, this one was incomplete and Natick lost. Sudmyer was Smokey Moresi’s assistant basketball coach when the Flyers had the great David Blatt, now the head coach of the Cleveland LeBrons. Blatt went on to captain Princeton and a storybook career coaching in Israel and Europe. Sudmyer saw leadership qualities in Blatt even then. “He was a cafeteria monitor. I can still hear his voice, telling the student to pick up their trays and clean up. Have some pride. There weren’t many leaders like him.” It’s that kind of leadership Sudmyer wants to see more of at Framingham High, starting with team captains. “I don’t want them to be captain just for the ‘C’ on the shirt,” he said. “The captain has to be the conduit between the players and coaches. Problems have to be brought up for discussion before they get worse.” Sudmyer recognizes that Framingham is a diverse town of 70,000. Some of the kids have to work after school because of family situations. “They can’t devote time to come out for a team,” he said. “I’m definitely going to talk about that in the classroom. I’m an educator. We’ll get the job done. “There’s an untapped talent pool here.” Lenny Megliola can be reached at lennymegs@aol.com. Follow him on Twitter @lennymegs.
