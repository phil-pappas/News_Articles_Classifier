Now, the rookie outfielder is preparing for the World Series with the Mets. Yes, he knows how lucky he is. Conforto could not possibly overlook realizing just how lucky he is.\n“I hear it all the time,” Conforto, 22, said regarding some of the sage advice from older teammates, guys who have been legally able to drink for more than a few blinks of the eye.\n“Conforto” and “World Series” have been paired together in the past. Not in the major leagues, but Conforto competed as an 11-year-old in the 2004 Little League World Series with Redmond, Wash., and in the 2013 College World Series with Oregon State. Neither of those ended the way he wanted.\nSo, Conforto is hoping the third time is the charm.\n“What I will say is I haven’t won a World Series every time I’ve gone there,” Conforto said. “So hopefully saving it for this one right here.”\nYeah, a 2015 World Series ring should ease the sting of losing to Owensboro, Ky., in 2004 or Mississippi State (which lost the final to UCLA) in 2013.\nFrom the LL vault: Randal Grichuk and Michael Conforto dominate the ’04 #LLWS ! #TBT http://t.co/rAjfu5YpdY pic.twitter.com/AZ5mXvZnYR \n— Little League (@LittleLeague) October 8, 2015 \n\nConforto on Friday sat in front of the media, with Matt Reynolds, trying to explain the emotions of the World Series, attempting to describe just what it has been like, going from late July call-up to someone about to play games that have been the stuff of dreams for all players, whether on a Little League, high school, college or professional diamond.\n“We’re very, very fortunate, that’s why we’re not going to take it for granted and that’s what everyone tells us: ‘Enjoy these moments. They’re very rare. But soak them in,’ ” said Conforto, who has been starting in left field against righties, but is just 1-for-15 in seven postseason games for the NL champs. “It is very tough because everything’s going so fast now and we’re trying to stay focused.”\nBut from Little League to college to the pros, Conforto has tasted team success. Has he ever been on a team that stunk?\n“No, I don’t think I have,” Conforto said. “My high school team was good. We didn’t win the state, but we went to the tournament. I’ve been really fortunate to play on a lot of good teams. My family, my parents have had a big impact on that just knowing who good coaches were.”\nAnd now he is just days away from his next World Series.\n“Obviously, we’re on the biggest stage,” said Conforto, who was summoned from Double-A Binghamton on July 24. “This has been my dream. This has been everybody’s dream. Everybody has always dreamed of winning the NLCS and going to the World Series.”\n \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under little league world series ,  michael conforto ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  world series", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:12:08.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
