(Photo: Mike Curley/Daily World) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLAFAYETTE – Mark Hudspeth is starting to recognize the traditional characteristics in his UL offense and he says that’s encouraging. \nThe Cajuns, Hudspeth said on Monday, are back to playing what he calls “Ragin’ Cajuns football, something his said was evident in last Saturday night’s 49-27 Sun Belt Conference victory over Texas State. \nWhat’s Ragin’ Cajuns football? \nHudspeth had a definition ready at his weekly Monday press conference. \n“”It’s the type of football that we’ve been used to, which is playing physically and playing very tough. \nAlso we’re once again getting the ball to our playmakers,” Hudspeth said. \nHudspeth said the physical element especially in the Cajuns’ offensive game was a missing element as his team began the season 1-3. \nAgainst Texas State, Hudspeth said he saw a different offensive perspective. \n“I think we weren’t spreading the ball around enough. (Against Texas State) I saw so many other people making a contributions. \n“That’s really when your offense can click,” said Hudspeth. \nHudspeth said junior quarterback Jalen Nixon, who started against Texas State, did a good job of making sure running back Elijah McGuire and wide receiver Jamal Robinson said ample chances to make plays. \nMcGuire carried 28 times for 170 yards. \nThere were other options that Nixon also noticed, Hudspeth said. \nPass receivers Al Riles (9 receptions, 98 yards), Robinson (4-67-2 touchdowns, and Gabe Fuselier 5-51) helped the Cajuns move the ball. \nNixon thew only seven incompletions off 29 attempts. He passed for 238 yards and three touchdowns in addition to rushing for 45. \nHudspeth said Nixon, who has been polishing his offensive skills, has continued to improve. \nThat means Nixon will be the UL starting quarterback until further notice. \n“As the season has gone on, he has gotten more reps and gotten better. He’s been showing progress on a good, natural curve. \n“(Nixon) has really played six good quarters of football (two at Kentucky, four against Texas State. As he improves, he can really help us. \n“Some of the passes he threw the other night were really darts,” Hudspeth said. \nMcGuire, also a junior, is becoming more of a complete back, said Hudspeth. \n“He is way more durable and he is a completely different style back than he was two years ago. He can punch it inside, get it our on the perimeter or get it on outside where he makes people miss,” Hudspeth said. \nNEXT GAME: The Cajuns won’t play this Saturday. Instead UL begins preparations for next Tuesday night’s nationally televised game at Arkansas State. \nASU has another game before the Red Wolves play UL. The Wolves meet South Alabama this Tuesday night also on national television.
