Efforts are also on to build a rail link across the seven states of the northeast region,\" Gadkari said at the inauguration of a three-day conference organised by RSS-affiliated Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram.\nLauding the work of the Ashram, Gadkari said what cannot be done by the government is being done by the Ashram.\nMaharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao, who inaugurated the event, hailed the contribution of tribal communities in India's freedom struggle.\n\"History could be re-written if the contribution of tribals in the freedom struggle was explored in detail. The tribals were in the forefront during India's first war of independence in 1857. The nation can't forget the contribution of tribal leaders like Birsa Munda, Komaram Bheem, Hirabai, Rani Gaidinliu of Nagaland, and many others in various struggles,\" he said.\nLamenting that tribal communities have not received the benefits of development as much as others, Rao said there should be a separate chapter in school text books which will highlight the role of tribals in the freedom struggle and civilisation.\n\"Tribals are an integral part of India. They have contributed to the development of Indian civilisation, culture and tradition. There are several references to the tribals in the ancient scriptures of India.\n\"In tribal communities, women are always treated with respect and dignity. Today the world is talking of maintaining a harmony between man and nature. But, these tribals are a living example of perfect harmony between man and nature,\" he said.\nThe Governor also congratulated Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram for its \"outstanding service and exemplary work\" for welfare of tribals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:25:53.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
