The individual race matches Jason Argueta of Cliffside Park against Derek Lewandowski of Ridgefield Park but don’t count out Frank Scallo of Dumont.\nUNITED BOYS, 4:25 (DON BOSCO): It’s not certain which seven runners Don Bosco will put on the line, but it is certain that the Ironmen will win their sixth straight Big North title and extend their league winning streak to 20 years over three leagues and four different divisions. Connor Nicholson and Justin Fuhrman have won titles in the past but may not run today. The only boy who can break up the DB monopoly is junior Caleb Shaia of Bergen Catholic.\nPATRIOT BOYS, 4:35 (RIVER DELL): River Dell will repeat here, with the only team question whether the division record of 29 points will fall. Will Daly has been called the winner each of the last two years while running step for step with twin brother Colin. That could happen again unless teammate Patrick Robertson beats them.\nAMERICAN GIRLS, 4:40 (CLIFFSIDE PARK): The Red Raiders swept the dual meets and should have little trouble winning a fourth straight title, and their No. 1, Jennifer Polo, should repeat as individual champion.\nUNITED GIRLS, 4:55 (IHA): IHA and Holy Angels have swapped league titles since the non-public schools separated out starting with the 2000 NNJIL meet, with IHA winning nine titles and the Angels five. Injuries make IHA the favorite in what is essentially a dual meet and look for Giavanna Tabbachino of IHA and Rhiannon Novelli of Holy Angels to battle for the individual title.\nPATRIOT GIRLS, 5:10 (RAMSEY): Maybe the best team race of the day is the final race of the 2015 league season with River Dell looking for its first league title of any type since the 2000 BCSL American title. Current coach Briana Bayersdorfer led the Golden Hawks to victory that year, and after a dual meet win over three-time champion Ramsey earlier this year, may lead River Dell to victory again. Shannon Goria of River Dell should easily repeat individually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:06.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
