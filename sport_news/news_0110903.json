Presumably Flood wants to prevent opposing coaches from knowing Rutgers' exact scholarship count, but the information is hardly secret.\nBased on Rutgers' own recruiting class announcements, conversations with former walk-ons who have received scholarships and other media reports, I have been able to compile a breakdown of the program's scholarship count. Again, Rutgers doesn't confirm its scholarship count so it's possible that a player or two is missing, but this list is as accurate as possible.\nA few notes: The NCAA limits Division 1-A football teams to 85 scholarship players on the roster. Also, programs are limited to 25 \"initial counters,\" which applies to incoming freshmen.\nPLUS: Former walk-on safety Andre Hunt earns scholarship\nAfter accounting for the four dismissed players, Rutgers currently has 78 players on scholarship.\nHere is the scholarship breakdown by class:\nSenior eligibility: 10\nJunior eligibility: 17\nSophomore eligibility: 15\nFreshman eligibility: 36\nFans are always interested in the scholarship count for recruiting purposes. At seven scholarships below the limit of 85 and with 10 seniors on scholarship, it would appear that Rutgers only has 17 open scholarships for the 2016 recruiting class. But that isn't the case for a number of reasons. Scholarships will open as players inevitably transfer, get kicked off the team, retire for medical reasons, decline to return for their final year of eligibility, etc.\nRutgers already has 18 commitments in the class of 2016. It's unclear exactly how many commits Rutgers will be able sign, but natural attrition should allow the program to add close to 25 players in the class of 2016.\nHere is the scholarship breakdown by position:\nQUARTERBACKS: 4\nRS So Chris Laviano\nRS So Hayden Rettig\nRS Fr Giovanni Rescigno\nFr Michael Dare\nRUNNING BACKS: 6\nRS Sr Paul James\nRS Jr Desmon Peoples\nJr Justin Goodwin\nSo Josh Hicks\nSo Robert Martin\nFr Charles Snorweah\nFULLBACKS: 1\n6th-yr Sr Sam Bergen\nTIGHT ENDS: 6\nJr Nick Arcidiacono\nRS So Matt Flanagan\nSo Charles Scarff\nRS Fr George Behr\nFr Anthony Folkerts\nFr Nakia Griffin-Stewart\nWIDE RECEIVERS: 8\nSr Leonte Carroo\nRS Jr Carlton Agudosi\nJr Janarion Grant\nJr Andre Patton\nJr John Tsimis\nFr Rashad Blunt\nFr Jawuan Harris\nFr Dontae Owens\nOFFENSIVE LINEMEN: 14\nRS Sr Keith Lumpkin\nRS Jr Ryan Brodie\nRS Jr J.J.
