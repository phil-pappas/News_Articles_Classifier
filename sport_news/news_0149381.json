But the soreness is not considered serious, Ryan said, and the magnetic resonance imaging test is more a precaution than a precursor to surgery.\n Other than Dozier’s MRI, the Twins came out of their end-of-season physicals with no problems that need to be addressed, Ryan said at a wrapup press conference.\n With the season finished, Ryan now heads into an off-season that he hinted might be busier than fans expect. The Twins may have narrowly missed making the playoffs, he said, “but we’ve got a lot of areas we’d like to upgrade.”\n There’s not one specific position the Twins will target like they did the past two winters, when they made starting pitching a priority, the GM said. But he’s not satisfied with merely contending for a playoff spot, Ryan said, nor is he willing to simply wait for young prospects to develop.\n The team’s scouts and executives will gather this weekend in Fort Myers, Fla., for their annual organizational meetings, and Ryan said he expects some important decisions to be made, if not at the meetings, then shortly thereafter. Among them: whether Trevor May’s switch to the bullpen becomes permanent; whether to pursue any of the team’s five free agents (Torii Hunter, Brian Duensing, Mike Pelfrey, Neal Cotts and Blaine Boyer); and where Miguel Sano might wind up.\n That latter one is a conundrum for the Twins, because the rookie slugger “cannot get into the mindset that he’s just a DH,” Ryan said. But Sano’s minor-league position, third base, is filled by a productive veteran, Trevor Plouffe, and the first-base incumbent, Joe Mauer, has three years remaining on his contract. Ryan said he expects a solution to be found by spring, but gave few hints what that might be.\n May, too, will be informed of the Twins’ intentions before spring camp opens in February, Ryan said, even though the 26-year-old righthander said he will prepare for either role. May prefers to return to the starting rotation, however.\nOlder Post Postgame: Molitor wants to cut down on strikeouts, increase steals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:50:53.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
