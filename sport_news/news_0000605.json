After paperwork is completed, said Lt. Henry Reimann, Jackson will be turned over to their custody.\n\"They're hoping to bring him back\" with them this week, Reimann said.\nDetectives, he said, will try to meet with Jackson to interview him Wednesday night or Thursday.\nReimann said Jackson could be back in Washington County as soon as Thursday or Friday.\nJackson, 45, had been at large since 1991, when he and his older brother vanished while facing charges related to the kidnapping and torture of two young women in Portland.\nVance Roberts, Jackson's brother, was on the run for 15 years before he inexplicably surrendered in 2006 in Washington County. He's now serving a 108-year prison term .\nJackson was arrested Monday in Guadalajara, where he had been working in electronics, according to the U.S. Marshals Service.\nCNN's \"The Hunt with John Walsh\" featured the case in July. Acting on a tip that came in after the show aired, U.S. Marshals said they discovered Jackson's whereabouts and learned he was living under the name Pablo Bennett.\n-- Emily E.
