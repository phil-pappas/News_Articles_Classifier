Weathers and the Red Devils were held scoreless in the second half and lost 48-13 to the Bruins. For more photos of Friday night’s high school games, visit arkansasonline.com/galleries. \nThe Jacksonville Red Devils sure could have used an NFL-caliber defensive player against Pulaski Academy Friday night. Photo Gallery View \nAnd there was one in attendance at Jan Crow Stadium, Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Clinton McDonald. \nBut McDonald, a 2005 Jacksonville graduate, could only watch as the Pulaski Academy rolled up 645 yards in a 48-13 victory over Jacksonville. \nJust before kickoff, McDonald handed his alma mater an NFL 50th Super Bowl Anniversary Golden Football, an award designed to be given by every player who has appeared in a Super Bowl to the high school from which they graduated. \nMcDonald played for the Seattle Seahawks in their Super Bowl victory after the 2013 season. \nSophomore quarterback Layne Hatcher completed 27 of 41 passes for 506 yards and 3 touchdowns to lead Pulaski Academy. Junior running back Jaren Watkins rushed 12 times for 103 yards and 2 touchdowns. \nHatcher passed for 370 yards in the the first half as Pulaski Academy (7-0, 3-0 5A Central) built a 27-7 lead, with touchdown passes of 67 and 43 yards to senior receiver Zack Kelley. \nJacksonville (1-6, 1-3) cut Pulaski Academy's lead to 27-13 before halftime when quarterback Rowdy Weathers kept for a 14-yard touchdown run with 38 seconds left in the second quarter. \n\"Overall, we're glad to win,\" Pulaski Academy Coach Kevin Kelley said. \"We're glad to get another conference win and to have a chance for home-field advantage. But Jacksonville has some athletes, and they run fast. When they get to the ball, they hit. Jacksonville's always had a tough team.\" \nJacksonville had a chance to pull within a touchdown after a 33-yard pass from Weathers to Robbie Knowlin put the Red Devils at the Pulaski Academy 16 early in the third quarter. But Pulaski Academy senior Cody Anderson intercepted a Weathers pass on fourth and 6 from 13, and he returned it 63 yards. \nWeathers caught Anderson from behind to save a touchdown, but Weathers injured his left, non-throwing shoulder on the tackle and missed the remainder of the game. \n\"I think he [Weathers] just misread it, but then he goes down there and makes the tackle,\" Jacksonville Coach Barry Hickingbothom said. \"But that's just the way our kids play.\" \nPulaksi Academy scored after the turnover on a 1-yard pass from Hatcher to senior Tre Bruce to take a 34-13 lead with 9:16 left in the third quarter. \nLR McCLELLAN 70, LR FAIR 0 \nPierre Strong rushed for three touchdowns and Andre Campbell ran for two more as Little Rock McClellan (5-2, 3-1 5A-Central) defeated Little Rock Fair (0-7, 0-4). Strong had six carries for 78 yards and Campbell rushed twice for 28 yards, both runs resulting in touchdowns. The Lions scored six touchdowns in the first quarter. Strong scored on a 55-yard run, Karl Harris on a 14-yard run and Campbell on a 23-yard run. Jaylen Houston returned a Fair fumble 23 yards for a touchdown, while teammate Kyreek Lair also forced a fumble and scored. McClellan’s Tyrse Lair had a 46-yard punt return for a first-quarter touchdown. \nSports on 10/17/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:08.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
