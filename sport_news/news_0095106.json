Margao : FC Goa will be keen to build on the momentum as they take on defending champions Atletico de Kolkata in their second match of the Indian Super League Season 2 at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, here on Wednesday. Both teams are coming into this match with wins. Kolkata getting the better of Chennaiyin FC 3-2, and Goa beating Delhi Dyanmos 2-0. FC Goa coach Zico is aware that his team had a bad start last year and are now looking to make amends as they set their sights on the title this time. “We have started well winning our first match and are now looking to win our next two at home before we play the away matches which will raise the confidence of the team,” said Zico. “Last year, we were unlucky not to win the semi-finals as we created lot of scoring chances but failed to get a winner in regulation and ultimately lost on penalties. “This year, both teams have made lot of changes and we do not know which team is the best, it will decided tomorrow. The encounter is not going to be a revenge match but a usual game,” he said. Besides having home advantage, Goa are also boosted by a fit squad. The visitors, however, will be without their key striker Helder Postiga who was injured in the last match and has been ruled out half the season with a hamstring injury. Midfielder Jewel Raja, defenders Tiri and Josemi too will miss out as they are recuperating from injuries.
