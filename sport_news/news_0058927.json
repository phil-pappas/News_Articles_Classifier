It was his fifth postseason game in a row with a homer and sixth overall.\nCubs rookies Jorge Soler and Schwarber also homered. It was Schwarber's fifth home run of the playoffs.\n(Writing by Larry Fine in New York; Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:48:51.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
