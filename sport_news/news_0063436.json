But why the Jags? \nTheir owner, Shad Khan, has been an important piece to the NFL's stay-cation in London. He's also the owner of the Football League Championship's Fulham F.C., which is based in London. (Video via The Florida Times-Union ) \nKhan said on Thursday : \"Our interest in extending our agreement to play a home game each season in London is nothing new. So, we're very happy to make it official today.\" \nAnd Khan, a global businessman, showing commitment to the NFL's first real push to expand beyond the U.S. could pay off for him. \nNFL execs and some owners have been vocal about wanting a permanent team in London sooner than later. \n\"Can we have it in Great Britain? I think so. Yes, I think there's enough there to get interested,\" Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told CBS . \nAnd with the Jaguars building a fan base there now, if expansion to London happens, they could be first on the guest list. \nThe writing's definitely on the wall, and Khan isn't shy about it. In August, he said an agreement until at least 2030 was possible. \n\"I think it's a critical part of our franchise to be able to play games there, get the recognition, build a fan base and get sponsors,\" Khan told reporters . \nAnother way the NFL is hoping to bring the game to more international prominence is Sunday's first-ever live stream of an NFL game on Yahoo, free of charge. Suddenly, the London Jaguars doesn't sound too far-fetched. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:04:53.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
