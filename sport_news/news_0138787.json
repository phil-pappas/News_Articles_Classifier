The product comes standard with an assortment of features to suit numerous applications, from a casual BBQ in the park to an extended camping excursion. The makers of the Grillrider have launched a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of 95,000 euros to fund its production.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151022/279611\nTwo Grillrider models are available – the starter model with 13 features, and the regular model with 19 features. The Grillrider Starter features include, but are not limited to:\n4-person, adjustable-height dining table Locking lid Bottle opener Grill tray Handles for attaching bulky items Anti-slip parking feet 2-in-1 Drawbar with on-click latch mechanism Three year warranty Ability to extend starter pack to regular model at later date The Grillrider standard model comes with all of the features found on the starter model, plus an LED light bar, USB charger for devices, eco-friendly gas grill, modular container section, insulated 85-liter cooler and an active rear light. Most of the Grillrider's features have been inspired by user feedback and requests. The mission is to deliver a product with almost countless usage scenarios and limitless versatility.\nBoth models of the Grillrider boast 150 liters of storage space and an interior drain to allow for easy clean up. The product's light yet strong construction means contents are well protected even on bumpy terrain. An insulated lid ensures no annoying rattling and no chance of spillage. The exterior is water and UV resistant, so it will always look good as new. The Grillrider's wheels detach for easier storage, while a \"kickstand\" helps the product remain stable when parked.\nThe goals of the Grillrider's designers are simple. They want to empower everyone with a sense of spontaneity and freedom. In addition, they want their product to combine functionality and convenience in a way no other bike trailer ever has. The Grillrider is also something of an attention-getter, and users are likely to strike up new friendships while out and about. Finally, walking, biking and enjoying the outdoors are great for everyone's mental and physical health. If the Grillrider encourages more people to embrace this lifestyle, they will count the product as a resounding success.\nAbout the Grillrider\nThe makers behind the Grillrider are an enthusiastic team of BBQ fans. Having a proper BBQ, however, requires gathering and transporting lots of bulky items like charcoal, grill, drinks, food, chairs, and usually much more. That reality inspired the team to innovate its own solution – a bike trailer loaded with features and built to last. Feedback from friends and family then motivated the next step, namely a full commercial product with startup help from the Kickstarter community.\nContact:\nUlrich Bell\nwww.grillrider.com\n+498966011219\nEmail\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-grillrider-empowers-active-fun-lifestyles-showcases-modern-german-engineering-and-ingenuity-300164826.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
