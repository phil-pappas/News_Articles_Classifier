In addition to McClendon, bench coach Trent Jewett, third base coach Rich Donnelly, outfield coach Andy Van Slyke and bullpen coach Mike Rojas were also let go.\"I have a great deal of respect for Lloyd, as a person and as a manager,\" Dipoto said in a press release . \"It is a credit to his professionalism that the team continued to play hard through the final day of the season.\"Still, the team had underperformed after preseason expectations that they could contend for a playoff berth.\"After extensive conversations it became clear to me that our baseball philosophies were not closely aligned,\" Dipoto added. Some of the coaching staff, however, including Mariners legend and batting coach Edgar Martinez, infield coach Chris Woodward and pitching coach Rick Waits, were invited to return next year.McClendon managed the Mariners to a 163-161 record in two seasons in Seattle. The team finished this year 76-86. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
