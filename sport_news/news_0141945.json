He's got four Super Bowls, he took a run at the NFL commissioner and won, and the dude posts up in GQ rocking a pair of Uggs and somehow pulls it off. That trifecta can attract some interesting fans.\nThe New England Patriots and their star quarterback were in Arlington today taking on the Dallas Cowboys , but that didn't stop a diehard fan from rolling up with some, uh, interesting signs of support.\nThis wonderful lady rolled into AT&T Stadium wearing a shirt that reads \"Sit On My Face Tom Brady,\" and an accompanying sign with the always hilarious play on Deflategate, reading \"Hey Brady You Can Inflate My Uterus.\" Judging by the large drink she's holding in her hand in the picture above, this woman came ready to woo Brady to the fullest.\nNo word on if Brady saw her in the crowd, or if Gisele is currently on the private jet to come give this girl a black eye, but please stay tuned for those important updates.\n[Via Twitter]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:32:30.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
