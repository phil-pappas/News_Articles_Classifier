Yankees can't lock up home field 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Baltimore\nThe New York Yankees still may host the AL wild-card game.\nWherever they play it, they will have to execute better to reach the next round of the playoffs.\nNew York failed to clinch home field twice Saturday, getting swept by the Baltimore Orioles 9-2 and 4-3 in a day-night doubleheader.\nWith the Yankees needing one win to host Tuesday's one-game playoff against Houston, the Los Angeles Angels or Texas, reliever Dellin Betances allowed the go-ahead run in the second game on his second wild pitch of the eighth inning. The Orioles roughed up Ivan Nova in the opener.\n\"I was trying to go up with that fastball, and I just yanked it,\" said Betances, who allowed an earned run for the first time in 39 road appearances.\nNew York (87-74) has lost five of six and is one game ahead of Houston (86-75) for home field. If the Astros end up tied and don't win the AL West, Houston holds the tiebreaker and the game would be played at Minute Maid Park.\n\"I think you'd have to have your head in the sand not to know what you need to do,\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. \"We need to win.\"\nAfter Betances' 15th appearance since Sept. 1, Girardi said he may not use the setup man on Sunday, though the right-hander said he'd be ready.\n\"If they want me to go, why not?\" said Betances (6-4), who has thrown 84 innings in 74 appearances.\nPaul Janish led off the eighth with a flared single, reached second on a wild pitch, took third on Gerardo Parra 's bunt single and scored on the second wild pitch.\nT.J. McFarland (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings for Baltimore, and Zach Britton got his 36th save after picking off pinch-runner Rico Noel at first.\nManny Machado hit his 35th home run, connecting for a fourth consecutive game, and Nolan Reimold hit the first leadoff homer of his big-league career.\n\"We're just trying to finish the season strong,\" Machado said of the Orioles, who moved to 80-81. \"That's the way we've played all season and we're not going to stop now.\"\nDespite splitting his regulars between two starting lineups on a cold and crisp day, Girardi insisted when Saturday began that home field remained important.\n\"Obviously you want to play in front of your home fans,\" said Girardi, whose team is 8-10 over its past two homestands. \"Our club is built for that ballpark. You get to sleep in your own bed. You don't have to travel as much. I think it means a lot.\"\nHe added that he also wanted to protect his team's health in the kind of weather that can lead to injuries.\nNew York then went 3-for-19 with runners in scoring position in the doubleheader.\nIn the first game, Nova (6-11) allowed eight hits in 52/3 innings, walked three and hit a batter. He had a 5.07 ERA in his first season since Tommy John surgery.\nBaltimore's Wei-Yin Chen (11-8) allowed two runs in six-plus innings in what may have been his final start as an Oriole. Chen, who is eligible for free agency, struck out three while allowing four hits and three walks to finish his fourth major-league season with a 3.34 ERA.\n\"I will be happy if I get given the chance to come back here,\" Chen said through a translator. \"But sometimes as a professional player, sometimes it's inevitable that you have to change team and adapt to a new environment.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/63/8735977/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/63/8735977/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:20:56.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
