He played William Shakespeare in the West End production of Shakespeare in Love and is currently starring in The Winter’s Tale , directed by Kenneth Branagh. We spoke to him in London about taking on Robert Louis Stevenson’s enduring character(s).\nWhat’s this Jekyll and Hyde like?\nIt’s a reimagining by Charlie Higson ; he’s written this Doctor Who/Buffy the Vampire Slayer-type thing, where I’m actually Jekyll’s grandson. Richard E Grant plays the head of a government body that hunts monsters. At the beginning of the series, I come to London to sort out my inheritance from my grandfather.\nThe show is in the 6.30pm slot – are you aiming for the Doctor Who market?\nChoosing it to be at 6.30pm was mostly to do with trying to reach as many people as possible. If you put it earlier, you’ll only really get the kids; if you put it too late, you’ll lose the teenage audience they’re going for as well. Hopefully we can get the Doctor Who audience and they can stay loyal to Doctor Who and us as well. Going up against them head-on would be stupid.\nWho was the most fun to play, Jekyll or Hyde?\nOf course it was Hyde. Although, after the novelty of smashing stuff up and being Hyde had worn off, Jekyll was probably the more interesting to play. Jekyll has to deal with the consequences of what Hyde does, and also the frustration of not being able to do what Hyde does; having to abide by rules, having to behave a certain way. Charlie has given Hyde supernatural powers as well, so he’s this infallible character; there’s almost nothing that can challenge him.\nThe story has been adapted countless times for the screen. What makes it so enduring?\nI think Jekyll and Hyde looks at that side that everyone has to them; there’s a part inside us that kind of wants to say, “Fuck it all”, and not have to abide by the rules. We all have dark desires.\nHave you gone off and watched other versions?\nNo, I haven’t. I read the book. You can’t ever replicate something – and if you do, what’s the point? I did watch certain things – I watched the Batman films; I watched Sin City – these stock-character comic book guys.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bateman as Jekyll: ‘He’s probably the more intersting to play.’\nWhat do you in preparation for the characters?\nFor Jekyll, I tend not to do much preparation; for Hyde, it’s completely different. I’ve drawn on different people – Heath Ledger’s Joker. I listen to music – something I took from an actor I worked with called Harry Lloyd [Game of Thrones]. If you’re playing someone who’s not like you at all, it’s good to find music that is their rhythm and their energy.\nWhat kind of music did you go for?\nThere’s a song by Daft Punk [Within] : “Many rooms to explore but the doors look the same.” It’s all about not knowing the full extent of one’s own personality. The Hyde one I used was The Prodigy’s Diesel Power . It got me in the mood to smash stuff up. It really gets your heart going.\nWhich do you enjoy more, working in theatre or in TV?\nI don’t miss working on camera as much as theatre. But I do love film and television because it’s so immediate; you walk on to a set and the tables are dusty, and everything’s as it should be. Nothing really teaches you for the film world. I’ll never forget when I was doing Spooks; on my first day, I walked into this hotel room and I couldn’t believe how many people were in the room.\nWhat has been your favourite part of working on the show?\nThe action stuff. In my first week we were out in Sri Lanka and I was jumping on to a moving steam train while screaming at my [on-screen] dad. The size of it was such an enjoyable thing.\nHas it made you want to do more of anything specific as an actor?\nThe main thing it’s given me confidence to do is play against character type. Jekyll is quite me: young man; polite. But being able to play Hyde was quite fun, to create a character that’s nothing like me. I quite enjoyed creating a new character like that: he had a different voice; physicality; mannerisms. Everything had to be thought about. It was a real challenge.\nWhat was it like working with Richard E Grant?\nQuite bizarre. The first scene I had with him, we were in this garden and I grab him, pin him up against this wall, and smash his face in. It was quite odd texting my mum, saying: “Hi. Yeah, I’m just pinning Richard E Grant up against a wall.” The guy is hilarious on set and off set. He’s obsessed with smells. In this garden on the first day, he’d smell everything. Even in the studio he’s walking around just smelling the tables, smelling people’s coffees. Quite a bizarre man. He’s kind of mental.\nJekyll and Hyde, Sunday, 6.30pm, ITV", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/939ad262708a5d5c85f3ac129adb6d0672da1a5d/0_0_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=1229345de8a18e170c7ef07b57c325d0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5l2ChAqRDg", "http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/jekyll-and-hyde-ep1-video1", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Tom+Bateman+on+playing+both+Jekyll+and+Hyde%3A+%27Hopefully+we+can+get+the+Doctor+Who+audience%27&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftv-and-radio%2Ftvandradioblog%2F2015%2Foct%2F25%2Ftom-bateman-on-playing-both-jekyll-and-hyde-hopefully-we-can-get-the-doctor-who-audience&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F939ad262708a5d5c85f3ac129adb6d0672da1a5d%2F0_0_3550_2130%2F3550.jpg", "http://www.itv.com/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/939ad262708a5d5c85f3ac129adb6d0672da1a5d/0_0_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=a9031763d9140e2de42ac2a0e0f75cbe", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/939ad262708a5d5c85f3ac129adb6d0672da1a5d/0_0_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=b5735213d33a7066a3e695cb8f075e47", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/939ad262708a5d5c85f3ac129adb6d0672da1a5d/0_0_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0952333b8ee24fee5f3ba185f2eae6eb", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwntZfuyJG0", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4df5f%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4df5f&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F939ad262708a5d5c85f3ac129adb6d0672da1a5d%2F0_0_3550_2130%2F3550.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Tom%20Bateman%20on%20playing%20both%20Jekyll%20and%20Hyde%3A%20"], "published": "2015-10-25T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:58:15.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
