We fumbled six times and didn't get the ball to bounce our way. But I'm so proud of my kids for bouncing back this week and trusting what we tell them to do.\" \nFlorida High's Kevin Sawyer Jr. runs the ball against NFC during their game on Friday. (Photo: Joe Rondone/Democrat) Overtime theatrics \nWith 1:40 left in regulation, NFC (4-2) tied the game at 28-28 and Florida High withstood a seconds-remaining Eagles possession to reach overtime. \nSeminoles quarterback Isaiah Hill punched in a 1-yard touchdown run to score first, then NFC completed an improbable fourth-and-goal play. \nEagles quarterback Avery Thomas hit Nate Shafer in the back of the end zone to tie, and NFC immediately went back to work on offense. \nThis time, a fumble— NFC's fourth turnover of the game— allowed Florida High (5-2) to line junior kicker Chase Allbaugh up for a first-down field goal. \nAllbaugh, who was 5 for 5 on extra points previously, ignored an Eagles timeout and drilled the 27-yard game winner. \n\"Every practice we work on it, over and over,\" Allbaugh said. \"Our coach calls timeouts to freeze us. We just come out and do it. Feels really good.\" Buy Photo \nFlorida High's Isaiah Hill throws a pass against NFC during their game on Friday. Hill threw 4 touchdowns on the night and ran for another score in overtime. (Photo: Joe Rondone/Democrat) Eagles down early \nNFC turned the ball over on its first three possessions, leading to 14 Florida High points and a quick deficit. \n\"Any time you turn the ball over against a good football team, it's going to be hard to come back,\" Eagles coach Robert Craft said. \"But our guys fought back and put it all on the field. Win or lose, you've got to learn from this. It's not district play, so certainly you want a good feeling, but we start district play next week. It matters starting next week.\" \nHill was masterful, starting 6 of 6 passing and throwing touchdown strikes of 28 and 18 yards to Karenz Stephens and Christian McGowan, respectively, in the first quarter. \n\"I've known this offense (for years), it was the guys around me that needed help, learning things, recognizing things,\" said Hill, who was 15 of 20 passing for 204 yards and four touchdowns on the night. \n\"It's still a challenge lining up in formations sometimes, but we're doing a good job.\" Buy Photo \nFlorida High's Christian McGowan catches a touchdown pass against NFC on Friday. (Photo: Joe Rondone/Democrat) See-saw affair \nLike a veteran team, however, Florida High didn't wilt when NFC responded, and when it made its own costly mistakes. The Seminoles had three turnovers during regulation as well. \nThe Eagles got a touchdown run by Jay Harrison before half to get close, then tied the game in the third quarter when Thomas threw a screen pass that running back Terrell Powell turned into a 29-yard touchdown. \nHill came right back and led his offense quickly down the field, re-taking the lead with an 11-yard swing pass to Kevin Sawyer. \n\"It's a lot about about heart and team,\" Hill said. \"It's just a bond. Everyone is staying calm. That's the main thing, we stayed calm throughout and played throughout the game. Each down we came out ready to play.\" Buy Photo \nNFC's Jay Harrison breaks the pile for a touchdown against Florida High at NFC on Friday.

Our guys up front did a great job. But Korey was determined. He wanted to play offense, defense and special teams at the end. I love that out of our seniors.\" Buy Photo \nNFC's Korey Charles jukes Florida High's Quinterrius Hill at NFC on Friday. Charles rushed 17 times for 159 yards and a 30-yard touchdown, while adding a 39-yard touchdown on a screen pass. (Photo: Joe Rondone/Democrat) Mathews in the middle \nBesides Charles' production, NFC receiver Armunz Mathews was a big component of the Eagles' second-half surge. \nHe finished with nine receptions for 129 yards, most on 15-plus yard gains on deep slants from Thomas (21 of 35, 249 yards). \n\"It was probably the most times we've got him involved, but he's another one playing both sides of the ball,\" Craft said. \"Those guys want to be on the field. I'm proud of them for wanting to be in there when the lights are on, trying to have a moment.\" Buy Photo The NFC Eagles burst out on to their home field to play against Florida High on Friday.
