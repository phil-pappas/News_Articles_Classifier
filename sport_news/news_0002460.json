ALBANS, Vt. (AP) â€” Actor Randy Quaid is expected back in a Vermont court on a charge that he left the country five years ago after being accused of vandalism in California.\nQuaid and his wife Evi were arrested Friday trying to enter the United States from Canada. They've been held on $500,000 bail each. Quaid is to return to court Thursday.\nThe Quaids are wanted in Santa Barbara, California, on felony charges from 2010 after they were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned.\nCourt papers said the Quaids damaged or destroyed furniture, a fireplace and a mirror. They're charged with occupying the property illegally and failing to appear for court dates. Evi Quaid also is charged with interfering with sheriff's deputies. She pleaded not guilty to being a fugitive from justice Monday.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:13:43.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
