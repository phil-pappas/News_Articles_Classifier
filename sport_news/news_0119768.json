His fellow Saints, a few paces ahead and touting the UEC River championship plaque, would have been proud. \n“My friends wanted me to say this,” Podl said. “Today, the course didn’t make the rules, but I did.” \nPodl and the rest of the field navigated what Geneva junior Andrew Abel dubbed a “pretty gusty” day. East (310) edged tournament co-host Geneva (313) atop the seven-team tournament leaderboard and also claimed the overall River title by avenging a Sept. 24 dual loss to the Vikings at Eagle Brook Country Club. \nBatavia (328) and St. Charles North (331) were next in the tournament, while both schools tied for third in the overall team standings. \nContinuing the snug motif, Geneva freshman Tyler Isenhart topped Abel for River Player of the Year standings, 30.5 points to 27. Wednesday’s medalist round of 2-over par 73 boosted Isenhart, who began golfing at age 7 but “didn’t take it too seriously until last year.” \nTo be sure, tunnel vision enabled Isenhart to sidestep a four-putt on No. 16 – he teed off from No. 10 – and play 2-under the rest of the way. Isenhart birdied the third and fourth holes on a course he always has enjoyed playing. \n“It’s not that hard, and it’s in good condition and the greens are nice,” he said. \nAbout an hour before he officially announced it to the crowd, Vikings coach Eric Hatczel summoned Isenhart to inform him he was medalist. \n“He’s a really solid player,” said Abel, who shot 78. “Just fantastic. He played really well today.” \nSaints junior Daniel Haugen followed Isenhart by one stroke while collecting three birdies during the round. \nEast boasted five scores in the top nine and six in the top 14, but, by rule, only four count toward the team total. Sophomore Mason Meadows, a recent junior varsity call-up, shot 79, while Danny Buetow and Jacob Blood both carded 80s. \n“I knew coming into today we had to put up a good number as a team, and we had to grind it out,” Haugen said. “We knew it was going to be windy and we knew it was going to be chilly, but we had to play our best out there.” \nBatavia’s scorers were Robert Carr (79), Nick Robinson (80), Andrew Nelson (84) and Sam Glore (85). \nHank Zimmer paced North with an 80, while Nik Janchik (83), Tyler Barton (84) and Alex Gruber (84) followed. \n“I was able to accommodate for all the different things I had to do, and I just kind of played to the best of my abilities,” Zimmer said. “I had a couple challenges, but I was able to get through them.” \nIt’s possible each of the Tri-Cities schools could reconvene at St. Andrews on Oct. 12 for an IHSA Class 3A sectional hosted by the Saints. \nEast, Geneva and North will compete at Tuesday’s Larkin Regional at The Highlands of Elgin, while Batavia heads to the Oswego Regional at Blackberry Oaks in Bristol. \nBatavia returns to the scene of last season’s triumph, where the Bulldogs earned the program’s first regional title since 1982. \nRobinson tied for medalist honors with a 79 but lost via playoff. \n“I have a lot of success there and history, so it’s going to be fun to go back,” Robinson said. “It’s pretty straightforward.” \nJack McDonald, Ethan Dalton and Dawson Peters each shot 81 for Geneva. \n“We’re all doing really good right now. We’ve got a good team chemistry going, and it’s good,” Abel said. “I’m happy with how we played today, too.” \nBoy, can Podl attest. \n“I went out there and I hit my driver straight and I had 28 putts,” he said, “and I can’t ask to do any better than that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:22:28.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
