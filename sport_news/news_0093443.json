The results will be available in eight to 12 months, according to a statement from the Iowa State Medical Examiner's office.\nSash, a standout safety at Iowa who won a Super Bowl during his rookie season with the New York Giants in 2012, was found dead at his home in Oskaloosa, Iowa, on Sept. 8. An autopsy was conducted the next day, but the results weren't clear until laboratory results were completed.\nThe autopsy determined the cause and manner of death was an \"accidental mixed drug toxicity involving methadone and hydrocodone,\" the office said Tuesday. Both are legal narcotics used to relieve severe pain, but are also highly addictive.\nThe medical examiner said that a recent shoulder dislocation and a history of chronic shoulder pain suffered by Sash were also \"significant conditions\" in the death.\nOskaloosa Police Chief Jake McGee said investigators learned that Sash had a doctor's prescription for hydrocodone but are not sure about how he obtained methadone.\nPolly Carver-Kimm, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, said she couldn't release any additional information about the pending CTE testing, including where it would be conducted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:20:30.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
