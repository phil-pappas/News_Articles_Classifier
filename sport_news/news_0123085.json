But who was David West in his younger days? And where did Ray McCallum play before the pros?\nRELATED: Australian Who Wants to be a Millionaire contestant stumped by question about Spurs, Patty Mills\nMany of us remember Tim Duncan's dominant time at Wake Forest, when he began his ascension to the very top of the basketball world, and the day the Spurs drafted him.\nBut few of us have seen the pre-NBA careers of foreign-born players like Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Boris Diaw.\nWe are about to scream our faces off for these guys on a wild emotional roller coaster we call the NBA season, so let's get to know them a little better with a look back at who they were before the NBA stardom.\nceudaily@mysa.com\n@chrisudaily", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/06/8790431/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg",
