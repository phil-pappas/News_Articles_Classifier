(Photo: File) \nEAST LANSING — Connor Cook is about to encounter one of the best opposing defenses of his career at Michigan State. \nIt might remind him, at least in approach, of the defense he practices against on a daily basis. \n“A little bit,” the MSU fifth-year senior quarterback said Tuesday of a Michigan defense that is stuffing the run, letting its speedy defensive backs handle big responsibility downfield, getting after quarterbacks and ranking among the nation’s leaders statistically – as the Spartans’ defense was doing on an annual basis before this season. \nCook talked about all the man-to-man coverage and “Cover 1” – man-to-man with a free safety playing centerfield – the Wolverines are playing this season under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh and defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin, compared with the softer zone coverages of previous seasons. He talked about a “great front seven” with “big, fast defensive linemen” and linebackers “who fly to the ball.” \n“But you know,” Cook said, “it’s why we come to a school like this.” \nAnd the experiences Cook has collected as the all-time winningest quarterback at his school make Saturday’s peripheral challenges less impactful as the No. 7 Spartans (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) prepare to visit the No. 12 Wolverines (5-1, 2-0). He is MSU’s main hope at what would be perceived as a significant upset based on both teams’ surprising performances to date. \nThis will be his first time playing in front of more than 100,000 mostly hostile fans at Michigan Stadium. But he has quieted a Lucas Oil Stadium packed with Ohio State fans, leading MSU back for a Big Ten championship triumph in 2013. He has bounced back from a first-half pick for a touchdown to lead MSU back for a Rose Bowl win over Stanford. \nHe has sent the home crowd unhappy in Iowa City and Lincoln, Neb., and State College, Pa., and he has shocked thousands of Texans in the home of the Dallas Cowboys, recovering from his own mistakes to turn a 41-21 Baylor lead into a 42-41 Cotton Bowl burglary. MSU quarterback Connor Cook said the hype and energy of playing big games helps players to elevate their effort. Chris Solari/LSJ \n“I’m expecting a very loud, hostile environment,” said Cook, who is 29-3 as MSU’s starting quarterback. “There is no such thing as a perfect football game, and things are going to go wrong, and I’m just trying to get focused right now as the week goes on and trying to picture myself making plays, visualizing myself making plays, and not being too high and not being too low and just staying level headed. In an environment like that, as soon as Michigan makes one big play, the stadium is going to erupt, but we’ve just got to continue to fight forward and fight to the end.” \nAnd for all the things that aren’t going well for the Spartans right now, Cook and his receivers will bring momentum to Ann Arbor. They had their best game of the season in Saturday’s 31-24 win at Rutgers. \nAfter a late 10-yard Aaron Burbridge run was correctly changed to a pass – Cook flipped the ball forward to Burbridge – Cook ended up with a career-high 367 yards, completing 24 of 39 passes with two touchdowns and an interception. \nThe winning touchdown was set up by the clutch play of the game, Cook’s deep loft to R.J. Shelton for 29 yards on a third-and-9 from the MSU 25. \n“That’s why he’s one of the top quarterbacks in the nation,” said Burbridge, whose career-high 10 catches for a career-high-tying 156 yards led a strong collective effort on the outside. \n“Outstanding quarterback, the record speaks for itself -- 29-3? That says it all,” Harbaugh said Monday of Cook. “The most outstanding wide receivers that we have played against or may ever. This is an explosive, talented group of eligible receivers.” Couch: Harbaugh an odd duck, but a coaching savant \nThe Spartans responded a day later with compliments of their own. Cornerback Jourdan Lewis has emerged as a star for the Wolverines, and safety Jabrill Peppers covers ground quickly and hits hard. Michigan is expected to get starting corner Channing Stribling back from an undisclosed injury. \nMSU fifth-year senior offensive lineman Donavon Clark said this is the best U-M defense he’s seen, a “technique-sound” group with three straight shutouts, a challenge that tells the Spartans “how much better we have to be as an offense.” \nThat starts with protecting Cook, giving him a chance at a performance that can give MSU the edge in this matchup and add to his own legacy. \n“You want to be in a situation like that,” Cook said. “You want to embrace it, and it’s things you look forward to. I’m looking forward to it. I can’t wait to go out there and play against them. You know, for them to pitch three straight shutouts, that’s hard to do in college football, doesn’t matter who you are, doesn’t matter who you are playing. To shut out the opponent, that’s hard to do, and they have a great defense. \n“So me as a quarterback, us as an offense, and us as a team, we’re looking forward to going in there and playing against a defense like that. Because you want to play against the best.” Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1RGABVD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:18:53.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
