Barrett at quarterback is the football equivalent of inventing the fly swatter. It required more common sense than genius, but regardless is expected to create a huge smash.\n\nRutgers tonight? Minnesota after the upcoming bye week? At Illinois after that? Splat, splat, splat.\n\nThat’s the assumption anyway. With Barrett running the offense, Ohio State is about to go NBA scoreboard on its opponents. The assumption had better be correct, too, because the College Football Playoff selection committee is watching. And the only thing those 13 committee members like better than double-dipping into the shrimp cocktail sauce at their Monday and Tuesday meetings — the first rankings will air at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 3 on ESPN — is gorging themselves on style points. The more the better.\n\nWhich is where it now gets tricky for the Buckeyes. Potentially. Keep winning, six more times, and Ohio State likely will reach the four-team playoff. But it is no guarantee. It might depend where the committee places OSU in the initial rankings, and that could be decided by how well the Buckeyes’ offense plays tonight under Barrett’s influence.\n\nMy expectation? It will be a butt-kicking in favor of the Buckeyes. I don’t buy into the trap-game talk that for some odd reason is hovering over Ohio State’s first visit to Piscataway, N.J. I guess people feel a need to peg one potential stumble this season. Rutgers won’t be it. That said, the Buckeyes can’t come close to tripping or they risk reducing their standing among the committee members.\n\nThe reasoning goes like this: Ohio State has not set the world aflame through seven games. Yes, it was a nice opening win at Virginia Tech, and the offense finally began to resemble its 2014 self last Saturday against Penn State in a blacked out Horseshoe (hopefully that was a one-and-done marketing idea).\n\nBut between those nice-enough victories were suspect results. If the committee had been forced to release its first rankings even two weeks ago, after a rather tepid performance at Indiana, Ohio State might not have made the top four.\n\nFortunately for Buckeye Nation, amends were made against Penn State. But now comes the interesting part. Like me, the committee is expecting fireworks from a freshly detailed Ohio State offense. No more clunky execution out of Cardale Jones, who despite being 7-0 this season (and 10-0 as a starter dating to last season) never looked comfortable either in finding receivers or completing longer passes to them. Jones’ uneven running of the option keeper undoubtedly turned heads on the committee, but in the wrong direction. Hard to watch. Love 12 Gauge, but the time had come.\n\nEnter Barrett, whose emergence elicits uncorroborated boasts from Ohio State fans in a similar way to older Buckeyes who claim, like 7 million others, to have been in Ohio Stadium for the famous 1950 Snow Bowl.\n\nUndoubtedly, you already have heard from these self-proclaimed Nostradamuses, who wag a knowing finger as they attempt to jog your memory: “Remember when I predicted J.T. would be starting by the end of the season?”\n\nYeah, and I predicted in August that leaves would turn color this fall. Big deal. But I digress.\n\nBut what if the Buckeyes plant only 30 points on the Scarlet Knights? Or, worse, can’t make it out of the 20s? Egad, it’s one thing for antsy fans to fiddle with their nachos as they wonder why the offense is not putting more points on the board than Stephen Hawking can compute, but what will the committee think? If Jones couldn’t hang half a hundred on Hawaii or even 40 on Western Michigan? And now Barrett can’t either? Gulp. Maybe it’s not the QB? Maybe it’s the whole durn enchilada?\n\nStyle points, people. Style points. Let’s not forget how Ohio State wedged its way into the playoff last season. That big old 59 on the left side of the scoreboard stood out like a costumed pizza shop employee shaking a sign by the side of the road. Impossible to ignore. If the Buckeyes don’t win that Big Ten championship game 59-0 against Wisconsin it’s likely Texas Christian or Baylor playing Alabama in the semifinal. And Zeke Elliott’s famous march — “85 Yards Through The Heart Of The South” — would not be adorning the fronts of OSU fans’ T-shirts.\n\nOf course, the zero on the other side of the scoreboard helped Ohio State’s cause, too. But human nature being what it is, voters mouths go agape more over gratuitous scoring than the dearth of it caused by a dynamite defense.\n\nSummary: Ohio State needs to wax Rutgers to the tune of a 40-point win. And all the more impressive in the eyes of the committee if it’s 60-20 instead of 47-7.\n\nThe move has been made: Barrett as offensive maestro. The Buckeyes, who have been running on 87 octane, will be expected to hum along on rocket fuel from here on out.\n\nGiddy up. \n*  *  *\nRob Oller is a sports reporter for The Dispatch. \n\nroller@dispatch.com \n\n@rollerCD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:43:16.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
