But the path from there to the final horn wasn't that straightforward. \nVilseck made an interception on Wiesbaden's potential go-ahead possession, but a penalty call reversed the turnover and extended the Warriors' drive. Wiesbaden marched deep into Falcon territory before Vilseck's defense came through again, this time on a Jaleel Edwards interception in the end zone. \nThe Falcons ran out the clock to earn the first divisional win of their eventful season. \nArmando Pinckney put the Falcons on the board just before halftime with a 5-yard touchdown run, capitalizing on field position provided by a Kenneth Hooks blocked punt. \nDeshon Barrow scored a first-quarter touchdown and Eric Arnold nailed a 20-yard field goal for Wiesbaden. \nAfter missing the playoffs last season, Vilseck has now tied defending champion Ramstein - although that game doesn't count towards playoff positioning - and beaten 2013 champ and 2014 runner-up Wiesbaden. But losses to Stuttgart and Lakenheath have prevented the Falcons from ascending fully into the Division I elite. They'll continue that effort next weekend against winless Kaiserslautern. \nWiesbaden suffers a setback after taking one big step forward last weekend in a rout of those same Raiders. The Warriors will take a precarious 2-1 divisional record into the toughest stretch of their schedule. Their last two regular-season games come against Ramstein, which blanked Wiesbaden in last year's title game, and Stuttgart, which beat Wiesbaden in this year's season opener.
