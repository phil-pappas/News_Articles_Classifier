And after Thompson let Thursday’s deadline to ink a $6.6 million qualifying offer come and go, he’s officially become the rare NBA holdout.\nThe Cavaliers have stood firm with their offer, while Thompson is seeking to be paid a max contract – something in the range of five years and $94 million.\nThompson’s protracted free agency has been one of the biggest stories of this summer – an odd twist, considering he’s a largely unremarkable player. Thompson does have positives: He’s durable (having missed just one game through four seasons), and he’s a decent defender and rebounder.\nLeBron James with his arms around Thompson (right) and Kyrie Irving Photo: Getty Images But in a league where shooting and spacing are increasingly important, Thompson is a throwback to the days when power forwards were expected to be more like Charles Oakley than Dirk Nowitzki. He has virtually no shooting range — 76 percent of his attempts last season came within five feet of the basket, and he didn’t attempt a single 3-pointer. The most notable thing about Thompson’s shooting ability is that he switched shooting hands two years ago, from left to right.\nHe isn’t even a starter. Yes, Thompson was terrific during last season’s playoffs, a key component in Cleveland’s run to the NBA Finals. But that came after Kevin Love injured his left shoulder in the Cavaliers’ first-round sweep of the Celtics. Now that Love is back in the fold after agreeing to a five-year max contract, Thompson will revert to a bench player. Thompson averaged around 27 minutes in that role last season.\nAll of that makes it hard to justify Thompson camp’s insistent stance.\nBut when you look closer at where the Cavaliers stand – they’re the overwhelming favorites to emerge from the East for a second straight season – they need Thompson on board. Considering Cleveland hasn’t won a championship in over 50 years — in any sport — letting a contractual dispute like this potentially disrupt a title contender won’t sit well with fans. It doesn’t help the Cavaliers’ side that Thompson is good friends with franchise icon LeBron James, and the two players share an agent in Rich Paul.\nThis situation is far more complicated than you would normally see for a player who averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds last season.\nSo what is the outcome? Cavaliers general manager David Griffin doesn’t know. He had told NBA TV he expected Thompson to be at training camp Friday – presumably after signing the qualifying offer Thursday or agreeing to Cleveland’s offer.\nPart of the issue here is the bizarre nature of restricted free agency. The system is set up with rights-holding teams having virtually all of the leverage: They are able to match any offer, and there’s little incentive for opposing general managers to offer a contract because it can tie up their cap space while they wait for it to be matched. It can be difficult for players like Thompson to find another team willing to give him an enticing contract.\nOf course, Thompson is arguably more valuable to the Cavaliers than he is to any other team – to the point where it’s very likely no one else was willing to offer Thompson the original five years and $80 million Cleveland offered him three months ago.\nThe logical conclusion to this stalemate would be a five-year, $85 million compromise, which would allow Thompson to get a bigger contract than fellow restricted free agent power forward Draymond Green signed with the champion Warriors earlier this summer, but would still save Cleveland a significant amount of money in luxury tax payments.\nBut who will blink first in this three-month staring contest, and when?\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under cleveland cavaliers ,  lebron james ,  nba full court ,  tristan thompson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:34:48.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
