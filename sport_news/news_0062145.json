The 28-nation alliance has set up small command and control centres flying NATO flags from Estonia to Bulgaria, which can be backed up by rapid-reaction forces in the event of an attack.\nBut Libya's collapse, the rise of Islamic State militants, Syria's civil war and the European Union's failure to stabilise its southern neighbourhood are now NATO's problems too and NATO member Turkey shares borders with Syria and Iraq.\nRussia's intervention in Syria has complicated an already complex scenario, testing the alliance's ability to deter a newly assertive Moscow without seeking direct confrontation.\n\"We used to talk the eastern threat and the southern threat, but now the two have merged,\" said one NATO official.\n'MOBILE TRIP WIRE'\nNATO's efforts at deterrence in the east have produced one powerful new tool that exercises will test out: a 5,000-strong \"spearhead\" force that can deploy in less than a week.\nThe exercises, named Trident Juncture, aim to certify the spearhead force, which has air, maritime and special operations components, allowing it to become fully operational next year. It is part of a 40,000-strong rapid-reaction force.\nYet it is just one step, with some military experts calling it a 'mobile trip wire' that would simply slow down any Russian advance. Even its deployment is the subject of debate, with some members, such as Poland, seeing its role only for NATO's eastern flank, supporting NATO's fundamental role of collective defence.\nWarsaw sees the spearhead force as going some way to meeting its appeals for NATO to permanently station thousands of troops on its territory because of the crisis in Ukraine.\nOthers, including the United States, France and Britain, are willing to see it be used in Turkey and outside NATO borders, potentially helping to stabilize post-conflict governments in Libya or Syria, what NATO calls 'crisis management'.\n\"We may not need a reinforced land brigade for the south, you could easily see how maritime, air or special operations forces might be useful,\" said Douglas Lute, the United States' envoy to NATO.\nDespite the east-south debate, NATO's planners of the Trident Juncture exercises proved to be prescient because they are not about reacting to an attack on a NATO ally.\nIn the fictitious training scenario, a U.N. Security Council resolution authorises a NATO mission to help protect a threatened state and to safeguard the seas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:11:07.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
