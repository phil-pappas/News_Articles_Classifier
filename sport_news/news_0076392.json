We all started out together and we turned professional almost at the same time. Gaganjeet has turned superstar now and so has Anirban,\" he said. \n\n\"I'm playing well right now. I just need to put forth all these together. It's more mental than anything else. These guys are really good and they really know how to handle themselves. That's something I really need to learn. I just do my own thing and I just try to keep focused.\" \n\nHend, who won the Macao Open for the second time in three years, praised Chiragh's battling spirit. \n\n\"Chiragh played amazing golf for a guy who hasn't got a full card. His golf this week was amazing and hopefully he can get an invite into this week's tournament. He played very good,\" said the 42-year-old, who won his seventh Asian Tour title in Macao. \n\nLahiri, who also finished tied-second with Chiragh, hopes his countryman will continue the momentum in the second half of the season. \n\n\"I'm very happy to see how well Chiragh played. It's a big year for him; he's become a dad. He lost his card last year but he has won so many times in India. He's just showed that he can play under the gun when it really matters as he had a lot to play for,\" said Lahiri. \n\n\"It was really impressive to see how he handled himself, including the putt on the last. I'm happy for him and hopefully he wins on the Asian Tour soon. He nearly won the Indian Open a few years ago so he can get it done.\" \n\nLahiri, who has won twice this season, extended his lead on the Order of Merit to $1,011,984. He is the third player in Asian Tour history to surpass the $1 million earnings barrier in a single season, achieved thus far by countryman Jeev Milkha Singh and Thai Kiradech Aphibarnrat. \n\nHend, who won with a record winning total of 20-under-par 264, took home the winner's prize purse of $180,000 and moved to second place on the Order of Merit with $438,781. He will defend his Hong Kong Open title this week. \n\nAsian Tour Order of Merit (Top-10) \n\n1. Anirban Lahiri (IND) $1011984.65 \n\n2. Scott Hend (AUS) $438781.66 \n\n3.
