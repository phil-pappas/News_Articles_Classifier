Luck’s shoulder injury is not considered to be serious. \n“At this point that is certainly their hope and expectation,” Rapoport said on NFL Network. “They did some tests on Andrew Luck’s shoulder earlier in the week. They found no structural damage to explain why he was experiencing some soreness, just some bruising in his throwing shoulder.” \nLuck was initially expected to play on Sunday, but he apparently did not show enough shoulder strength throughout the week. The injury he is dealing with sounds very similar to the one Drew Brees battled in recent weeks, and he missed just one game before returning to play well against the Dallas Cowboys Sunday night. \nThe Colts badly needed a win against the Jaguars, so Luck’s injury must have been serious enough that the team did not want him to risk a setback. Fortunately, Hasselbeck did just enough. A third consecutive divisional win would be huge for Indy, so hopefully Luck doesn’t have another performance that inspires Chuck Pagano to make controversial remarks .
