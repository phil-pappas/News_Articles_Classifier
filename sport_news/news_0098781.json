LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis Cardinals starter Jaime Garcia was removed due to a stomach virus after two shaky innings of Game 2 in the NL Division Series.\nGarcia badly blew a play on a safety squeeze by pitcher Kyle Hendricks that led to the Cubs' five-run second inning and was victimized by another successful squeeze the next at-bat.\nThough none of the runs were earned, the lefty's first postseason start since 2012 was a disaster. He left trailing 5-1.\nThe team made the announcement before the fifth inning.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
