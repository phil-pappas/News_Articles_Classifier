At birth, he had the umbilical cord wrapped around his arm preventing the arm from growing properly. \nBen has never been one for making excuses. He wasn’t going to wear a prosthetic arm and he would just have to work that much harder to play the sport he loves. \nFurther proving his commitment he was able to convert part of his home into a place for him to train. \n“My basement is a mini hockey rink, I played there a lot, I got used to it and when I got on the ice I just did the same thing as I did in my basement,” Stewart said. \nThat system seems to be paying off, as head coach Jeff Christian says he sees improvement in him every day. \n“He’s confident, hockey stuff is coming around and he’s getting more used to the speed and pace, he’s an inspirational story for the rest of the kids,\" Christian said. \nBen’s goal has never been to be perfect, but when it comes to playing in the NHL, that’s more like it. \n“If I continue to play with this team, having them make me better I think I could,\" Stewart said. ©2015 by 10TV.com.
