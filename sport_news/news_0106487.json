LRSC found that in last weekend’s home tournament, where it went 3-2 and came back in some sets for wins. Now, it’s time for another tournament. This one the Sub-Regional XIII Tournament in Rosemount, Minn. this weekend. The 4-seeded Royals take on No. 1 North Dakota State College of Science at 1 p.m. Saturday. Gogebic Community College is the No. 3 seed and Dakota Career and Technical College is No. 2 in the double-elimination tournament. “I’m too competitive to say ‘let’s just do this.’ I want to win it,” Greywater said. “I don’t care what the season’s been. You go out to win and play your best. And if they play their best, they will have success.” Owning a 10-25 record, the tournament last weekend gave the Royals confidence as they treated it like the Sub-Regional. “We needed that,” sophomore outside hitter Cody Shwaluk said. “Being at home helped with fans and family getting to see that we can win and finish games. I think we’ve kind of figured out how to win now. We know what we need to do. We just have to keep working hard.” Shwaluk has needed to step up her game with Hannah Hextall sidelined with an ankle injury. Hextall, one of LRSC’s top hitters, practiced a little this week and is questionable for the tournament. That causes a shift in the Royals’ lineup. Sophomore Ali Joslyn has been moved from her libero spot to outside hitter. “Playing libero and playing outside, it’s a lot of the same,” Joslyn said. “Half the time I’m in the back row and I’m in the same spot. I played outside in high school and we got second in our state tournament. So I’m used to that pressure. But I hope Hannah is there to play it so I can play my position.” Greywater said she will need her two sophomores to step up this weekend, something they’ve shown the capability of doing. “We’re going to request a lot out of Cody,” Greywater said. “We need her to hit some balls this weekend. Ali is going to have the weight of the world on her shoulders, but she can handle it. Cody, we need a big consistent swing out of her and she's been doing that for us for awhile. For Ali, she might play outside, she might play libero. It’s wherever we need her and she can handle that.” Page 2 of 2 - The Royals have had an intense week of practice, going through different scenarios. Thursday, LRSC practiced as if they were in a match with set scores. The result was more added confidence. “We found that competitive edge,” Greywater said. “We played it like it was a game. What our issue is isn’t the fact that we can’t stay in a game. It’s the mental capacity of the game and it’s our own errors that sometimes bury us. We worked hard on controlling what we can control in a game in order to have success.” Saturday will present a big challenge, facing the 21-7 Wildcats, who swept LRSC twice in the regular season. But the added confidence has the Royals looking forward, not back. “We expect to win,” Joslyn said. “We want to beat Science. Our entire goal is to go get Science.” By Sam Herder   Sam Herder", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:53:51.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
