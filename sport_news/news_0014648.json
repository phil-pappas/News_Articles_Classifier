The Bears, seeming sailing toward a huge victory, drowned. \nUCA was leading undefeated McNeese State, 13-7, was driving and seemingly had the Cowboy defense on its heels. \nThen, the snap. \nWide receiver Jatavious Wilson went in motion. The snap glanced off his hip and bounced right into McNeese safety Wallace Scott’s hands for a 45-yard scoop-and-score that gave the Cowboys a 14-13 lead with 14:50 left. \nThat generated the wave that engulfed the Bears within eight minutes in the 28-13 defeat before 10,527 at First Security Field at Estes Stadium. \nGaining field position after holding UCA to three-and-out on its 8, McNeese drove 46 yards to Ryan Ross’ 10-yard scoring run. The Cowboys turned a fumble recovery after on the UCA 16 into another score, a 2-yard run by quarterback Daniel Sams to break the game open with 6:56 left. The fumble came after a sack on backup quarterback Kirk Baugh, who entered the game after Hildebrand reinjured his left shoulder. “Just a bad, bad call on the head coach’s part,” said UCA coach Steve Campbell after the snap snafu. “We tried to do something you can’t do against a good football team. I’ll take it (blame) for that one. “They were showing blitz and we checked to the other side. I should not have put Jatavious, Hayden (Hildebrand) and Alec (Willis, the snapper) in that position. I should have called a time-out.” \nThe victory gave the Cowboys (6-0, 5-0) the outright Southland Conference lead. UCA fell to 3-3, 3-1 and put itself in a must-win situation the remaining five games for a possible conference championship, co-championship or playoff berth. \nHildebrand re-entered the game with limited use of his shoulder and led the Bears on two late drives. A deep pass went off the fingertips of Brandon Cox, who had two steps on a defender. Later, on a desperation drive, Hildebrand completed five straight passes to Desmond Smith before Jake Grode’s interception at the McNeese 31 allowed the Cowboys to run out the clock. \nThe Bears lost the old-school defensive struggle while holding McNeese to 160 total yards on 61 plays and 62 lost yards. UCA gained 313 yards on 87 plays. The top two defenses in the conference butted heads in a stone wall of a first half that had a combined 13 points. UCA took a 3-0 halftime lead on Jace Denker’s 42-yard field goal. The Cowboys had 47 total yards the first half. UCA had 118. \nThe Cowboys got field position after a personal foul and drove 46 yards on their first possession of the third quarter to take a 7-3 lead on Sams’ 5-yard run. \nThe Bears then mixed their plays nicely and found seams for Dominque Thomas on a 78-yard, 12-play drive. Thomas scored from the 1 on a defense that just has yielded six touchdowns all season. A deep pass from Hildebrand to Smith set up Denker’s 44-yard field goal to put UCA in a nice position with a 13-7 led with 2:08 left in the third quarter. \nThe Bears came out of the physical games with injuries to Wilson, Cody Dausch and Dalvin Simmons, whose status will be further evaluated as far as Saturday’s game at Lamar. “If this (McNeese) is the best team in our league — and I don’t know whether it is or isn’t — but those guys are really good,” said Campbell. “If that’s the best and we can eliminate mistakes and make a few more plays, we might not lose another game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:23:05.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
