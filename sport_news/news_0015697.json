The Royals used a five-run seventh inning Saturday to complete yet another postseason comeback and win Game 2 of the AL Championship Series 6-3 over the Blue Jays at Kauffman Stadium.\nAdChoices The Blue Jays got on the board first in the third inning, ending the Royals’ 18-inning postseason scoreless streak.\nMORE: Best photos from Blue Jays-Royals ALCS | Ned Yost compares his starters to Braves' HOF'ers\nThe Jays added two runs in the sixth as Royals starter Yordano Ventura allowed RBI hits from Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki.\nTrailing by three runs with Blue Jays ace David Price dealing, the Royals in the seventh inning strung together five singles and a double to take the lead. Relievers Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis shut down the Jays in the eighth and ninth as the Royals completed their fourth comeback win this postseason.\nHere are our five takeaways from Game 2:\n1. One bad inning derailed Price's attempt at his first postseason win. Entering with an 0-6 record and a 5.23 ERA in six career postseason starts, Price looked like the Cy Young Award candidate that he is for most of the game. After allowing a leadoff single to Alcides Escobar to begin the game, Price retired 18 straight batters before the wheels came off in the seventh. Miscommunication between Ryan Goins and Jose Bautista allowed a Ben Zobrist flare to drop in right. The Royals took advantage of the error, getting singles from three of the next four batters to tie the game at three. Alex Gordon then doubled and Alex Rios drove in two additional runs. Price now owns a 7.02 ERA this postseason.\n2. Top to bottom, the Royals lineup is a threat. In each game, only one Kansas City batter (Alcides Escobar, Game 1 and Mike Moustakas, Game 2) has had a multi-hit performance thus far in the ALCS. In Game 1 the Royals' 1-4 batters hit .333 with three RBIs, in Game 2 it was the 6-9 batters producing with four RBIs.\n3. Encarnacion is still a dangerous hitter despite a finger injury. The strained ligament in his left middle finger is still affecting the Blue Jays slugger. His bottom hand slipped of the bat multiple times Saturday, but the All-Star still made great contact , going 2 for 4 with an RBI. He is now batting .320 this postseason.\n4. Kevin Pillar has had the most consistent bat for the Blue Jays. With his double in the third, Pillar has now hit safely in 21 of his last 25 contests, batting .385 with 12 doubles and 13 RBIs over that span. He has reached base safely in 24 of his last 25 contests.\n5. Tulowitzki is showing signs of life. The All-Star shortstop and prized offensive acquisition entered Game 2 in the midst of a 2-for-25 postseason slump, but Tulo snapped out of it in Game 2 going 2 for 4 with an RBI double.\nWhat's next: Game 3 in Toronto on Monday at 7 p.m. ET. The Royals will send Johnny Cueto to the hill hoping for a repeat performance of Game 5 of the ALDS. In that game, Cueto allowed just two hits, while retiring 24 of 26 batters faced, including the final 19. Marcus Stroman (4-0, 1.67 ERA in the regular season) will toe the rubber for the Jays as the talented 24-year-old looks to give the Jays their first win of the series.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-17/mlb-playoffs-2015-alcs-blue-jays-royals-edwin-encarnacion-finger-injury-david-price", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658461-mlb-playoffs-2015-american-league-championship-series-photos-pictures-royals-blue-jays-alcs/slide/366650", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-17/mlb-playoffs-2015-alcs-royals-ned-yost-braves-hall-of-fame-rotation-starters"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:24:57.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
