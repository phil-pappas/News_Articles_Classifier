The exact number down to the penny will be finalized within a week or so. The qualifying offer is set at the average of the top 125 salaries in baseball.\nThe qualifying offer is a one-year contract worth that $15.8 million. If the team makes a free agent the qualifying offer and he rejects it, then they're entitled to draft pick compensation if he signs elsewhere. The system has been in place for several years now and we've yet to see a free agent accept the qualifying offer.\nTeams have until five days following the end of the World Series to make the qualifying offer. Players then have seven days to accept or reject it. The qualifying offer must be made to receive draft pick compensation. There are no loopholes. So, with that in mind, let's try to figure out which notable free agents will and will not receive the qualifying offer.\nDEFINITELY GETTING QO \nWei-Yin Chen , Orioles \nChris Davis , Orioles\nDexter Fowler , Cubs \nAlex Gordon , Royals (assuming he declines $12.5-million player option)\nZack Greinke , Dodgers (assuming he opts out of final three years, $71 million)\nJason Heyward , Cardinals \nHisashi Iwakuma , Mariners \nHowie Kendrick , Dodgers\nJohn Lackey , Cardinals\nJeff Samardzija , White Sox \nJustin Upton , Padres \nMatt Wieters , Orioles\nJordan Zimmermann , Nationals \nMost of these players are self-explanatory, right? Davis, Gordon, Greinke, Heyward, Upton and Zimmermann are among the top free agents this winter and all are in line for way more than $15.8 million. Chen and Wieters are Scott Boras clients and Boras clients almost always look for the largest payday. They might not get $15.8 million annually, but their total packages will be worth more than that.\nThe Cubs acquired Fowler last winter hoping he would play his way into a qualifying offer and he did just that with 17-homer, 2.2-WAR season. Kendrick, Iwakuma and Lackey fall into the \"their teams would happily take these veterans back on a one-year, $15.8-million contract if they accept the qualifying offer\" category.\nI was tempted to put Samardzija in the next group but decided against it even though he was so disappointing this season (79 ERA+). Samardzija is only 30, he's a workhorse (213+ innings three straight years), and it was only a year ago that he put up a 125 ERA+ and 3.7 WAR. I can't imagine the ChiSox would let him go for nothing, especially after not trading him at the deadline.\nLIKELY GETTING QO \nBrett Anderson , Dodgers\nIan Desmond , Nationals\nYovani Gallardo , Rangers \nIan Kennedy , Padres\nDaniel Murphy , Mets \nColby Rasmus , Astros \nDenard Span , Nationals\nThese are the players who I believe are likely to get a qualifying offer, though a shred of doubt exists. The Mets are notoriously tight with payroll, which is why they might not risk Murphy accepting a qualifying offer. I think he gets one though. Rasmus, like Fowler, seemed to play his way into a qualifying offer, especially this postseason.\nAnderson will be one of the youngest free agents at 27 and he just threw a career-high 180 1/3 innings after throwing 206 1/3 innings total from 2011-14. I have to think he'll try to turn that into a multi-year contract. This offseason is likely the last best chance for Gallardo, Kennedy and Span to sign a big contract, so they'd decline a qualifying offer rather than accept the one-year deal and try again next winter.\nUNLIKELY TO GET QO \nAlex Avila , Tigers \nAsdrubal Cabrera , Rays \nRajai Davis , Tigers\nMarco Estrada , Blue Jays \nDoug Fister , Nationals\nDavid Freese , Angels \nChris Iannetta , Angels\nDioner Navarro , Blue Jays\nDarren O'Day , Orioles\nGood players, all of them, but not good enough for their teams to risk having them accept a one-year contract worth $15.8 million. A few months ago Fister was a lock for a qualifying offer, but injuries, a demotion to the bullpen, a 95 ERA+ and 0.2 WAR took him out of that price range. It's not impossible one or two of these players receive a qualifying offer, but it would surprise me.\nNOT GETTING QO \nMark Buehrle , Blue Jays\nA.J. Burnett , Pirates \nBartolo Colon , Mets\nDavid DeJesus , Angels (assuming $5-million team option is declined)\nChris Denorfia , Cubs\nStephen Drew , Yankees \nJeremy Guthrie , Royals (assuming team declines $10-million mutual option)\nTim Hudson , Giants \nTorii Hunter , Twins \nShawn Kelley , Padres\nCliff Lee , Phillies (assuming $27.5-million team option is declined)\nTim Lincecum , Giants\nJustin Morneau , Rockies (assuming $9-million mutual option is declined)\nBrandon Morrow , Padres\nJoe Nathan , Tigers (assuming $10-million team option is declined)\nSteve Pearce , Orioles\nMike Pelfrey , Twins\nA.J. Pierzynski , Braves \nMark Reynolds , Cardinals\nAlex Rios , Royals\nJimmy Rollins , Dodgers\nBuehrle, Burnett and Hudson are expected to retire after the season, and there's no reason to risk making the qualifying offer. Colon and Hunter could retire as well. Besides, their performance isn't worth a qualifying offer. Lee and Nathan are former All-Stars near the end of their careers. Both are coming off major arm injuries too. No qualifying offers for them.\nI think Lincecum's days as a well-paid rock star with the Giants are over. I do think he'll wind up back in San Francisco, but on a much smaller contract. He made $18 million in 2015, remember. After hip surgery and four straight years with no better than a 91 ERA+, Lincecum's not qualifying-offer worthy.\nNOT ELIGIBLE FOR QO \nMarlon Byrd , Giants\nYoenis Cespedes , Mets\nTyler Clippard , Mets\nJohnny Cueto , Royals\nAustin Jackson , Cubs\nScott Kazmir , Astros\nMike Leake , Giants\nMark Lowe , Blue Jays\nMike Napoli , Rangers\nGerardo Parra , Orioles\nDavid Price , Blue Jays\nJoakim Soria , Pirates\nChase Utley , Dodgers\nBen Zobrist , Royals\nThese players are not eligible for a qualifying offer because they were traded during the season. The rules state a player must spend the entire season with their club to be eligible for a qualifying offer, and these guys didn't do that. Big name free agents like Cespedes, Cueto, Price and Zobrist will not be tied to draft-pick compensation this winter.\nIt's debatable whether some of the other players listed would even receive a qualifying offer (Byrd, Jackson, Napoli, etc.), but the question has been answered for us. They're ineligible for the offer.\nOPTIONS LIKELY TO BE EXERCISED \nNori Aoki , Giants ($5.5-million team option)\nJose Bautista , Blue Jays ($14-million team option)\nJoaquin Benoit , Padres ($8-million team option)\nClay Buchholz , Red Sox ($13-million team option)\nR.A. Dickey , Blue Jays ($12-million team option)\nEdwin Encarnacion , Blue Jays ($10-million team option)\nJaime Garcia , Cardinals ($11.5-million team option)\nAdam Lind , Brewers ($8-million club option)\nDavid Murphy , Angels ($7-million team option)\nAlexei Ramirez , White Sox ($10-million team option)\nBrendan Ryan , Yankees ($1-million player option)\nBrad Ziegler , Diamondbacks ($5.5-million team option)\nThese are the contract options I expect to be exercised this offseason, meaning these players won't become free agents. Bautista and Encarnacion are no-brainers, and others like Benoit, Buchholz, Dickey, Garcia and Murphy are very safe. Position scarcity leads me to believe Ramirez will have his option exercised despite his poor year. Even if their current teams don't want these players, they have trade value at those salaries. No need to cut them loose for a measly draft pick.\n(Full list of free agent available at MLB Trade Rumors .)\n\nJason Heyward will receive a qualifying offer this offseason.
