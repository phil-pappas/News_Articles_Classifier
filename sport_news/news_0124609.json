Quarterback Charles App ran for three touchdowns for Kean (4-1, 3-1) -- a vastly improved team from the one that won just two games last season. \nThe score was almost identical to an NCAA first-round playoff game in 2011, when the Cougars ousted CNU 34-10. \nThe Captains went ahead 7-6 on quarterback Arsaiah Robinson's 1-yard touchdown run and Andrew Harper's extra point with 6:47 left in the first quarter. App's 11-yard TD pass to Tyler Hopman gave Kean the lead for good. \nHarper kicked a 29-yard field goal with 7:11 to go in the second quarter, but the Captains never scored again. \nCNU's Tyler Quigley was 21-of-40 for 224 passing yards but was sacked four times. The Cougars shut down CNU's rushing game, yielding just 38 yards on 29 carries. \nDaquan Davis led CNU with 40 yards on 14 rushes. Khiry Weaver (four catches for 73 yards) and Joe Jardine (seven for 67) were CNU's top receivers. \nApp was 14-of-22 for 202 yards, with one interception. He ran for 42 yards, but Damian Corredor led the Cougars with 172 yards on 21 rushes. \nJonathan Schmitt was Kean's top receiver, catching eight passes for 157 yards. \nDIVISION I: \nPenn State 29, Indiana 7: \nChristian Hackenberg threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns, and he ran for two more scores for the host Nittany Lions (5-1, 2-0 Big Ten). \nHackenberg was 21 of 39. He hit Brandon Polk and DaeSean Hamilton on 39-yard scoring strikes and turned a bootleg into a 1-yard touchdown run for a 19-7 halftime lead. \nHackenberg scrambled for a 5-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, and Tyler Davis kicked a 30-yard field goal to cap the scoring. \nZander Diamont scored on a 12-yard run for the Hoosiers (4-2, 1-2) but completed just 9 of 17 passes for 90 yards before he was injured and replaced by third-stringer Danny Cameron in the third quarter. \nRhode Island 20, Delaware 0: \nA week after a dramatic home win against William and Mary, the Blue Hens (2-4, 1-2 CAA) fell flat in Kingston, R.I. \nHarold Cooper ran for a career-best 123 yards and a touchdown, and Rhode Island picked up its first victory. \nThe Rams (1-5, 1-2 Colonial Athletic Association) posted their first shutout since a 3-0 win over Maine in 2006, 100 games ago. It was URI's first win in the series since 2011. \nThe Rams intercepted Joe Walker three times, including Tez Wilson's 25-yard return for a touchdown, URI's first pick-six since 2013. \nJustin Rohrwasser kicked field goals of 28 and 41 yards. \nDelaware outgained Rhode Island 283-239 but missed two field goals. \nDIVISION III: \nEmory and Henry 31, Bridgewater 7: \nTyree Ward scored three touchdowns, and the defense for the host Wasps (4-1) held the Eagles (3-2) scoreless after the second quarter. \nE&H's Kevin Saxton was 20-of-36 for 271 yards and four touchdowns, including a pair to Ward for the Wasps, who are coached by Hampton native Curt Newsome. \nWashington and Lee 35, Hampden-Sydney 28: \nConnor Chess broke a tie on a 20-yard touchdown run with 2:09 left as the Generals (5-0) won at Hampden-Sydney (3-2). \nW&L, off to its best start in many years, ran for 333 yards on 60 carries. \nThe Tigers' Edgar Moore threw for 357 yards and three touchdowns on 28-of-44 passing, but H-SC \nGuilford 55, Shenandoah 38: \nMatt Pawlowski was 18-of-36 for 363 yards and four touchdowns as the Quakers (4-1) won in Greensboro, N.C. \nAdam Smith caught 10 passes for 253 yards and three of those TDs. De'Eric Bell ran for 153 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. \nThr Hornets' Hayden Bauserman was 37-of-65 for 450 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. Shenandoah fell to 3-2. \nCatholic 28, Randolph-Macon 20: \nT.J. Tutone passed for 300 yards and two TDs on 28-of-37 accuracy for the Cardinals (3-2) in Washington. Lucas Morley caught 10 of those passes for 112 yards and both TDs. \nBubby Morgan was 17-of-31 for 275 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions for the Yellow Jackets (1-4).
