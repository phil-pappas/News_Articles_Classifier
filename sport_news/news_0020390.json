(AP) -- Triple Crown winner American Pharoah tuned up for the last race of his career with a sharp workout at Santa Anita.\nThe colt was timed in 46.60 seconds for a half-mile under Martin Garcia on Monday. Regular rider Victor Espinoza will be aboard Saturday in the $5 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Keeneland. After the drill, Justin Zayat, son of owner Ahmed Zayat, tweeted: ''Wow!!!! The beast is READY!!!!''\nAmerican Pharoah will fly to Kentucky on Tuesday, leaving trainer Bob Baffert's barn for the last time. He will remain in Kentucky to begin his new career as a stallion.\nThe Classic will be the colt's first start since finishing second to Keen Ice in the Travers, the lone loss in seven races this year. Besides sweeping the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont to become racing's first Triple Crown winner in 37 years, American Pharoah also won the Rebel, Arkansas Derby and the Haskell Invitational.\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing American Pharoah Martin Garcia Victor Espinoza Ahmed Zayat   906/68182   1423/2272   343/681  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:53:22.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
