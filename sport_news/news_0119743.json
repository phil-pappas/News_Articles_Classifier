TCU won in dramatic fashion in Lubbock, topping Texas Tech, 55-52. Now Baylor has a chance to make a statement this weekend against the Red Raiders, and some style points could go a long way in swaying the voters.\nTexas is also in need of some style -- and a win -- and visits the Frogs this weekend as Big 12 play starts to heat up.\nHere's a look at how this week's Best in Texas poll shakes out. Make sure to check out the full comments from the college bloggers here:\nRank School Points Previous 1. TCU (4-0) 127 (6) 1 2. Baylor (3-0) 124 (4) 2 3. Texas A&M (4-0) 111 (1) 3 4. Texas Tech (3-1) 100 4 5. Houston (3-0) 84 5 6. Texas (1-3) 81 6 7. Rice (2-2) 61 7 8. UTEP (2-2) 53 9 9. SMU (1-3) 47 8 10. Texas State (1-3) 31 10 11. UTSA (0-4) 28 11 12. North Texas (0-3) 12 12\n(How the poll works: A first-place vote is worth 12 points, second-place is worth 11 and so on. First-place votes are placed in parentheses next to a school's point total.)\n(Poll voters: Chuck Carlton, Nick Castillo, Mike DuPont, Joshua Friemel, Shehan Jeyarajah, Kate Hairopoulos, E.J. Holland, Bill Nichols, Kevin Sherrington, Brett Vito, Brandon Wheeland.)\nCLICK HERE TO SEE THE INDIVIDUAL BALLOTS\nBiggest margin: Texas and Rice. The gap between the two teams is fitting, as the Longhorns beat the Owls by two scores earlier this season (42-28). The divide, though, could begin to shrink if Texas can't find a way to stop shooting itself in the foot and win a close game. Rice, on the other hand, must regroup for a match against 3-1 Western Kentucky.\nSmallest margin: Three-way tie between TCU-Baylor, Houston-Texas and Texas State-UTSA. The trio of three-point gaps between teams represent the gaps on the field. TCU and Baylor are the class of the state(for now), Texas and Houston are fighting for the top tier, and Texas State/UTSA are trying to stay our of the basement.\nTeam everybody agrees on: North Texas. Speaking of the basment, The Mean Green's 46-point loss at Iowa on Saturday all but cemented their spot at the bottom of the poll. Only one voter didn't put UNT in dead last.\nTeam nobody agrees on: SMU. The Mustangs appeared as high as seventh and as low as 11th by the pollsters. The Ponies' 48-45 loss at home to FCS power James Madison sullied a few on SMU, as the Mustangs were the only team that dropped. Still, the early flashes SMU showed against powerhouse Baylor and TCU still seem to be fresh in the minds of most.\nBiggest riser: UTSA. The Roadrunners might not have moved up a spot, but they rose eight points and closed a 13-point gap to three with Texas State -- even though they didn't even win this week. The pollsters, however, put plenty of stock into the loss, a tight 33-31 contest to Colorado State.\nBiggest faller: SMU. The Mustangs dropped seven points, but they should consider themselves lucky it wasn't more after losing to an FCS program. There's not too many teams who wouldn't plummet in the poll with a home loss to a non-FBS program.\nPrevious polls Sept. 21: SMU gets fewer votes after close game against TCU\nSept. 14: Despite win, Texas continues slide in poll\nSept. 7: TCU maintains top spot; Longhorns drop in rankings after blowout loss\nPreseason: TCU gets nod as state's best over Baylor to start 2015\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S9si_VYD6xB-bo4nelXHcO3XuN3QqZSGqu141mX-7aI/edit?ts=5608a831#gid=0", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/20/best-texas-921-smu-gets-fewer-votes-close-game-tcu-texas-tech-closer-3-spot", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/27/best-texas-928-three-teams-receive-first-place-votes-smu-drops-loss-fcs-team", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/13/best-texas-914-despite-win-texas-continues-slide-poll"], "published": "2015-09-28T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:48:33.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
