And they can decide whether they consider that stuff happening.\"\nAfter his remarks, at a South Carolina event, Bush replied with frustration when asked if he made a mistake with his \"stuff happens\" comment.\n\"No, it wasn't a mistake. I said exactly what I said. Explain what I said wrong,\" Bush told The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza . \"Things happen all the time. Things. Is that better?\"\nLizza later posted on his Twitter feed Bush's full remarks , which show the candidate went on at some length before his \"stuff happens\" remark. Here's an excerpt from what he said when asked to comment on the shooting:\n\"Whenever you see a tragedy take place, the impulse in the political system, more often in the federal level but also at the state level is to do something, right? And what we end up doing lots of time is we create rules on the 99.99 percent of human activity that have nothing to do with the tragedy that forced the conversation about doing something. And we're taking peoples' rights away each time we do that, and we're not necessarily focusing on the real challenge. So if we have people that are mentally ill, to the point where they go into the vortex and they don't come out and they're hateful and they're in isolation and they kill people, the impulse in Washington is, take personal rights away from the rest of us. And it won't solve the problems of this tragedy that is just heartbreaking to see. Maybe we ought to be more connected in our communities, maybe we ought to have greater awareness of mental health challenges that exist all across this country. Maybe there is a better way to deal with this than taking...personal liberty away every time we kind of require people to do something.\" -- Jeff Mapes\njmapes@oregonian.com\n503-221-8209\n@jeffmapes", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJp4WhIASVk", "https://twitter.com/RyanLizza", "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jeb-bush-stuff-happens-oregon-shooting"], "published": "2015-10-02T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:46:09.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
