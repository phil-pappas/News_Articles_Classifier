He’s still young … he is finding his way in the league and it is the same thing. I don’t want to say I am a mentor, but if they have questions I want to help them as much as I can.” \nHorvat is delighted to have Vrbata on his right side. He sees a big part of his job as getting Vrbata the puck in spots where he can use a lethal wrist shot. \n“I just want to get him the puck as much as I can,” Horvat said. “Obviously, the more he shoots, the more he has the puck, the better he is. He is a shooter, he can score.” \nHorvat and Vrbata said the line is still at that getting-to-know-you stage, looking to find the on-ice chemistry that’s so important. \n“The combination between youth and veteran like that is great,” Horvat said. “Sven has tons of speed and skill, Verbie obviously has that scoring touch and I have a two-way game. So I think all the pieces of the puzzle are there. We just have to play with each other.” \nIn Wednesday’s season-opener in Calgary, Horvat’s line did not score, but generated lots of shots and spent considerable time in the Flames’ end of the rink. \n“I thought our line had the puck most of the game,” Horvat said. “We didn’t spend too much time in our end. Kudos to our D for getting us the puck, but I thought we played well. And it was only our second game together, so we have lots of room to grow.” \nHorvat, Vrbata and Baertschi combined for 13 shots. \n“It was a good first game overall,” Vrbata said. “We got the win and as a line we got better as the game went on. The first period was a little bit chippy, not much going on. But as the game went on I think we created some chances for us and some scoring shots. Hopefully we can build off of that and the more we practise and play together obviously we will learn each other a little more and hopefully we will be better.” \nIt’s a line constructed with goals in mind. Vrbata had a team-high 31 goals last season and Horvat has given every indication his offensive game is beginning to blossom. The wild card is Baertschi, who the Canucks acquired for a second-round pick late last season from the Flames. \n“I think Verbie and Bo are two players we would expect to produce,” coach Willie Desjardins said Friday. “I think it’s a little bit harder for Baertschi coming in. He is a little bit more of the unknown. His last three games have been his best three games and I think he is getting a little more comfortable. I thought as a group they had some offence to their game.” \nDesjardins also suggested Horvat and Vrbata indicated they wanted to play together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:00:25.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
