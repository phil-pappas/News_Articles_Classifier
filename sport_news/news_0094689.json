An off-day plus a home-field edge and manager John Gibbons discovered he had not one but a handful of hero-volunteers in an 11-7 win.\nToronto narrows the series to a 2-1 deficit, with the next two at the Rogers Centre.\nCritics had painted Ryan Goins as the goat in Game 2 but he redeemed himself on Monday with a clutch two-run single to give the Jays a lead in the second and added solo homer later.\nCritics fretted Troy Tulowitzki was a playoff bust, but he crushed a three-run homer into the centre field tarp-covered seats to put the Jays up by four runs in a game they had to win.\nCritics campaigned against Marcus Stroman in the playoff rotation with the slogan, “He is just not ready . . . nice hair though.” But despite that he took the ball and in just his seventh start this season gutted his way to victory, allowing 11 hits in 6 1/3 innings, aided by great defence.\nStroman, with his built-in high energy, fired up the crowd; the crowd, with its high energy, fired up Stroman. But baseball is a game of relaxed focus and the small-in-stature right-hander may have been over-amped in his second straight huge start, both of which took place at the sold-out madhouse the Jays call home.\nThe Royals once again opened the scoring in the first inning, as pesky leadoff man Alcides Escobar tripled to right field past a diving Jose Bautista on the game’s second pitch. And yes, he had swung at the first offering from Stroman as has become his unbreakable habit. With the infield back, Ben Zobrist hit a grounder to Goins that scored Escobar. The crowd was fidgety, already.\nBut Royals starter Johnny Cueto was not the Cueto of ALDS Game 5 against the Astros when he was brilliant through eight innings. Instead, this was the Johnny Cueto of the second half of the season, the huge disappointment at the top of the rotation that gave the Jays a sense of optimism.\nThe Blue Jays jumped on Cueto to take a lead in the second and then knocked him out in the third. With two on and one out, Kevin Pillar hustled to barely beat out a double-play grounder, leaving men at the corners for Goins. At the end of a brilliant at-bat, Goins shed the goat horns emphatically, driving a single to left for two runs. If they had laid a glove on Goins at the end of the play, his feet may not have been on the ground due to relief and excitement. Josh Donaldson then drove him home with a single.\nIn the third it was Tulowitzki’s turn to experience that needed sense of relief. He had shown signs of life in Kansas City with two hits in his final three at-bats, but the Royals had come back to steal the win. With the Jays’ lead narrowed to one, the lanky shortstop drove a Cueto pitch to centre for a three-run homer and a four-run lead. Recall in the ALDS the Jays trailed two games to none and he slammed another key three-run homer to left field, starting Toronto on the comeback in five games.\nIn the bottom of the seventh inning, Tulowitzki argued a call on what umpire John Hirschbeck saw as the outside corner, and he’s in charge. Tulo turned several times for a furrowed-brow comment and then on the way out to his position was ejected by Hirschbeck for continuing the discussion. Luckily for the Jays, Goins is as good at shortstop as at second, with Cliff Pennington at second.\nFor the second straight playoff series, the Jays dug themselves a hole, losing the first two games and leaving not much room for error. There were several key and major differences in this series. In the ALDS, the first two losses were at the Rogers Centre, meaning they had to travel to Arlington and sweep a pair from the Rangers in their park to force a Game 5 at home. They did it.\nHowever, in this series, the two losses were on the road, then coming home for three in a seven-game series. Whereas there had been just three teams accomplish what the Jays did in the ALDS, there are 13 teams that lost the first two of a seven-game series and came back to win. Better odds.\nThe bullpen could have been an issue with a lesser lead, but the two-run homer surrendered by Roberto Osuna, who told a reporter before the game his fingernail was broken and he might not be able to throw a slider, seemed the comment of a 20-year-old.\nIt was Jose Bautista’s 35th birthday on this night, and after the miscommunication in right field that opened the door for a Royals rally against David Price in Game 2, Goins may have handed him the best present of the day. He added his own RBI single in the righth to go with a pair of walks. Donaldson also added a home run as the Jays muscled up at home, with Game 4 on Tuesday afternoon.\nMore on thestar.com\nRyan Goins shines, Blue Jays survive Royals rally to win Game 3\nFans confident Blue Jays can get back in the series", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:43:23.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
