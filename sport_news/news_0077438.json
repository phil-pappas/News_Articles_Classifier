Hill finished the game with 142 yards. His totals includes runs of 52 and 62 yards. \nQuarterback Chancellor Johnson also showed he could pick up yardage on a keeper. The senior’s first two carries went for 23 and 27 yards. \nThe senior quarterback also connected on some timely passes, but even after the Cougars managed to move the ball into Westlake territory, they were often unable to convert. \n“We just have to find a way to finish,” McDonald said. “We turned the ball over on downs and we missed two field goals. We can’t do that.” \nWestlake took a 20-14 lead at the end of the first half in a game that featured an explosive final three minutes of the second quarter. \nThe two teams traded three touchdowns over the final 2:53 of the second quarter. \nAfter Hill capped a 68-yard drive with a two-yard plunge to give Newnan a 14-7 lead with just under three minutes left, the momentum quickly turned in the Lions’ favor. \nAfter a long kickoff set up the Lions near midfield, Willis called his own number and broke lose up the middle for a 50-yard touchdown. \nNewnan drove into the Westlake territory on its next drive but was stopped on fourth down, giving the Lions one more possession. \nWillis took advantage and hit two long passes on the drive, including a 48-yard pass to A.J. Terrell. The Lions missed on the 2-point try, but Westlake went into the half with a 20-14 lead. \nNEWNAN 7 7 0 7 — 21 \nWESTLAKE 0 20 0 21 — 41 \n1st Quarter \nN—Chancellor Johnson 27 run, (Rad Wyrick good) \n2nd Quarter \nW—Griffin 2 run (kick good), 6:30 \nN—Marquis Hill 2--run (Wyrick good), 2:53 \nW—Malik Willis 50 run (kick good), 2:40 \nW—Willis 48 pass to A.J.
