Most notably, the new Yahoo Mail app will let users combine accounts from services like Outlook, AOL Mail, and Hotmail all under the same roof, which even extends to the Yahoo Mail experience on the desktop. \"Email is the most prevalent way people communicate online. However, what we want from our inbox is evolving. Mobile use requires a faster and smarter inbox,\" said Jeff Bonforte, senior vice president of communication products at Yahoo. \"Both of these needs are at the center of our new app.\" The new app also introduces a new concept in password keeping, called the Yahoo Account Key, which the company describes as \"a more secure and simple alternative to the old password.\" Not much detail was given specifically to the way it functions, but Yahoo said it should simplify the sign-in process for Yahoo Mail thanks to the use of push notifications to grant users access to the secure content located within the app. The new Yahoo Mail app is available to download from the App Store for free right now [ Direct Link ]. Yahoo notes that the the desktop version of the overhauled Yahoo Mail is strictly aimed at United States users at launch and will be \"coming soon\" in other territories. The company encourages those interested in more information regarding its mail client to visit the Tumblr page devoted to the launch of the new software.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:21:54.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
