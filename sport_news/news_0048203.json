The judge ruled that Solo would have been forced to waive her right to a speedy trial in order to prepare a proper defense.\nKirkland city prosecutors appealed the decision in February, saying the municipal court's dismissal of the case was an abuse of discretion.\nA judge remanded the case to the city Friday to be tried again.\nSolo's domestic-violence case stirred debate in the sports world. Many commentators said she should be suspended. Her case came at a time when several NFL players faced tough penalties over domestic violence issues.\nShe was suspended from the US national team for 30 days after she was nearly cited for disorderly conduct in January, when Stevens was arrested for suspicion of driving the U.S. team van while intoxicated with Solo in the passenger seat. She was reinstated in February.\nIn the domestic-violence case, Solo is accused of repeatedly punching her 17-year-old nephew and half-sister.\nKirkland officers were initially sent to their home on June 21, 2014 on reports of a woman \"going crazy and hitting people.\"\nResponding officers heard shouting in the area and found a crying 17-year-old male with redness on one side of his face and wearing a torn T-shirt. The teen also had a bleeding cut on the bottom of his left ear.\nThe teen told police that his mother's half-sister, Solo, came over to visit, upset with her husband, former University of Washington and Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens.\nShe appeared to have been drinking and drank wine for some time with her half-sister, reports say.\nSolo later grew upset with her nephew over a misunderstanding, then reportedly insulted him, calling him \"too fat and overweight and crazy.\" The nephew told her to get out of the house and went into another room.\nSolo reportedly followed him, the argument escalating until Solo \"charged\" at him and took a swing at him, police reports say. She \"repeatedly punched him in the face and tackled him,\" according to records. The nephew grabbed her by the hair and held her to the ground until she appeared to calm down, at which point she reportedly grabbed his hair and pulled him back down, punching him some more, according to the incident report.\nSolo's half-sister arrived and tried to break up the fight, but Solo reportedly turned her aggression to her and punched her in the face \"several times.\"\nThe nephew got a wooden broom that he \"broke over (Solo's) head,\" but Solo reportedly did not relent, so he pointed a BB gun at her.\nSolo's half-sister ultimately pushed her out the door, but she re-entered through an unlocked sliding door and, after some argument, assaulted her sister some more, the affidavit says.\nPolice arrived to find that Solo's half-sister had a swollen left cheekbone that was turning purple.\nSolo told police she did not attack anyone and said her nephew attacked her with a broom. The sergeant she spoke to reported he did not see any injuries on Solo and that she refused to allow him to inspect her head.\nThe University of Washington alumna, known in court proceedings by her married name Hope Stevens, has maintained her innocence in pleadings and in public, painting herself as the \"true victim\" in the case.\nEarlier this year, Solo told ESPN The Magazine writer Allison Glock that she was ready to move on from the domestic-violence case.\n\"My name was completely smeared. I had already been compared to Ray Rice, to Adrian Peterson (NFL players penalized for domestic violence),\" Solo told Glock. \"From here on out, no matter what happens, I'll forever be associated with domestic violence.\"\n\"At this point, I have lost my endorsements,\" Solo added. \"I'm not trying to make a career out of that stuff anymore. I'm not trying to be famous. I just want to win the World Cup. I want to leave it all out there. No regrets.\"\nIn their appeal, Kirkland city prosecutors argued that they performed their due diligence in the case and could not be blamed for misconduct because of the alleged victims' failure to appear at scheduled interviews with the defense attorney.\nThey also accused the defense of trying to procure privileged medical information from the reported victims, calling such a line of questioning a \"fishing expedition.\"\nFurthermore, prosecutors denied infringing Solo's right to a fair trial.\nThey asserted the municipal court failed to find less extreme remedies to the challenges in the case before jumping to dismissal.\nDefense attorney Todd Maybrown, in response, argued \"calculated pattern of obstructionist conduct\" by the prosecutors.\nThe Portland, Ore.-based National Crime Victim Law Institute filed a brief supporting the alleged victims in the case, namely their refusal to discuss the nephew's medical history.\nThe ruling came a day after Solo was in goal in the championship game for the women's professional league in the United States.\nThe Seattle Reign lost 1-0 in the NWSL championships Thursday night against FC Kansas City.\nSolo, 34, has won two Olympic gold medals for the U.S. women's national soccer team and played on the 2015 champion U.S. World Cup team.", "external_links": ["http://law.lclark.edu/centers/national_crime_victim_law_institute/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:56:18.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
