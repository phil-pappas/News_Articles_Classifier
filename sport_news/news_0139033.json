And when Morgan was tackled short, Baldwin picked up to crash over. \nAnother Biggar conversion made it 17-3, yet Wales could not escape their scrummaging problems, and a second successful Volavola penalty as a direct result of those issues cut the deficit to 11 points at half-time. \nWales needed to assert authority early in the second period, but the complete opposite happened as Fiji grew in confidence on the back of a dominant scrum. \nAnd they breached Wales' defence in spectacular fashion, cutting loose from deep when wing Asaeli Tikoirotuma sprinted clear, and a stunning move ended with Goneva touching down, before Volavola's conversion underlined it was emphatically a case of game on. \nWales desperately had to calm things down, and that influence predictably arrived through Biggar, who landed a long-range penalty for his 12th successful World Cup kick from 12 attempts. \nThere was no pattern or predictability to the game, which unquestionably suited Fiji more than their opponents, yet another Biggar penalty opened up a 10-point advantage and Fiji finally had no reply.
