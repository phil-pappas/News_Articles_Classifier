(AP Photo/Chris Szagola) (Chris Szagola) Comments \nPHILADELPHIA -- Eagles head coach Chip Kelly famously referred to DeMeco Ryans as 'Mufasa' after the veteran inside linebacker and reverently respected team leader ruptured his Achilles tendon in Week 8 against the Houston Texans last season. \nRyans' nickname, inspired from the Disney Classic 'The Lion King' has stuck both among his teammates and Eagles fans alike. \nAfter the emergence of rookie inside linebacker and third-round draft choice Jordan Hicks, the University of Texas product is embracing a nickname of his own. \n\"We call DeMeco Ryans Mufasa,\" Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said, following Wednesday's practice. \"And Jordan Hicks Simba.\" \nFor those unfamiliar with The Lion King; Simba is the son of Mufasa who ultimately becomes king after avenging his father's death earlier in the movie. \n\"That's who they compare him to,\" Hicks said of Ryans' nickname on Wednesday, when asked if he finds the comparison between himself, Ryans and the Lion King characters appropriate. \"I like it. That's pretty cool.\" \nWATCH: Bradley Cooper sings Eagles' fight song with owner Jeffrey Lurie \nTrue to the respective nicknames, Hicks says that Ryans has been nothing short of a mentor to him. \n\"What haven't I been learning from DeMeco?\" Hicks asked. \"He's been huge for me. I've said it week in and week out. He's the guy I can go to whenever I have a question. I can sit back ... There are so many plays during a game that he makes that makes you say 'man.' You catch onto those things. You try to take some of those techniques and apply them to yourself.\" \nHicks will make his third consecutive start as it is unknown whether Mychal Kendricks will be available due to a lingering hamstring injury. Regardless of Kendricks' status, Hicks has played his way into a contributing role on this team. \nFollowing Week 6, Hicks is second on the team with 37 tackles behind only Jenkins for the team lead. Hicks also has one interception, three fumble recoveries as well. He even knocked Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo out for half of the season with a broken clavicle. \nOn Wednesday, Eagles defensive coordinator Bill Davis Jr. said that Hicks doesn't compare to any rookie he's ever coached and that he is much more similar to several veterans that he's coached throughout his career. \n\"That's a huge compliment,\" Hicks said. \"He's been coaching for a long time. I still have tons to learn and a lot to pick up. You take it with a grain of salt and keep growing, keep working but you obviously really appreciate those kind of comments.\" \nMatt Lombardo may be reached at MDLombardo@yahoo.com .
