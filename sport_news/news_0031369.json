Photo by Michael Lopez Participants in the Blue Devils' soccer clinic run drills. About 30 players attended the clinic, with member of the Blue Devil varsity, junior varsity and C teams leading it. “I am very proud of the girls for their commitment to representing this progrom in a positive light, and for the excitement they have shown in giving back to the community,” Wa-Hi coach Dana Evans said. “You really couldn’t ask for a better group of girls.” The clinic was in response to one of the requirements for the players to be a part of the Blue Devil program, Evans said, which is to have one practice dedicated to community service. Each team captain was responsible for deciding what that would be, and the three opted for the youth clinic. “This really was their project,” Evans said of the Wa-Hi players. “The girls organized it and executed the plan all on their own. The coaches were merely there to support if needed. “It was really neat as a coach to sit back and watch our girls during the clinic,” she said. “We got to see them in a different role. You could start visualizing which girls would be future teachers and coaches, and see how they shine in the opportunity to work with kids. Others, it was simply refreshing to see them relax and be a kid again by laughing and playing around with 8- and 9-year-olds. “For very different reasons, I think the clinic was just as good for our girls as it was for the younger kids. “I had the opportunity to chat with a few of the parents beforehand, and they were very happy that this clinic was taking place.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:51:33.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
