They then went to 6-A power McCracken County and fell 50-22 on Sept. 25. \nThe Panthers needed the break that was provided last week. \n\"The Owensboro game was very physical, and we went into McCracken County with several injuries,\" DC coach Matt Brannon said. \"The bye week could not have come at a better time for our guys to rest and heal and get ready for a run into the playoffs. \n\"We spent the majority of our time last week on fundamentals. We took it easy on contact and worked on technique and conditioning. We have had a very focused week of practice in preparation for Muhlenberg County, and the team is ready to get another win.\" \nDC will have several key players back for this matchup. John Stratton suffered a concussion against OHS and was cleared to play and practice last week. \nDefensive end Luke Baird is also back at full strength after he re-aggrevated a shoulder injury against OHS. \nReceiver-defensive back Jared McEwen also will return after suffering a concussion against McCracken County. \n\"This has been the first week in almost a month where we have been a full capacity,\" Brannon said. \nThe Panthers want to also get back to giving Chase LeCroy plenty of chances with the football. LeCroy has rushed 116 times for 527 yards and six touchdowns. \n\"We look to get back to what got us going at the beginning of the season, and that is feeding Chase LeCroy the ball,\" Brannon said. \"We look to use our size up front to control the line of scrimmage. Obviously, Stratton creates a match-up problem with most every team we play, and we look to take advantage of that as well. \n\"Also, our overall defensive speed will cause trouble for the Muhlenberg County offense, but we have to contain Hunter Combs, who could be one of the better athletes we have seen this year. He is a threat to take off at any time, and he is very difficult to tackle.\" \nCombs is the Mustangs junior quarterback who has truly been a dual threat this season. Combs has 744 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns. He has picked up 124 yards a game on the ground. Combs has also thrown for 783 yards (45-of-91), seven touchdowns and five interceptions. \nBy comparison, Panthers QB Adam Bouchard has hit 70-of-132 passes for 1,047 yards, 15 touchdowns and six interceptions. \n\"Offensively we're pretty simple. We try to spread it out for our running backs, having a dual-threat quarterback is always an advantage with our offense,\" Muhlenberg County coach Hays Browning said. \"We want to stay basic and hopefully take advantage of some of the opportunities when we have them.\" \nMuhlenberg County is also 4-2 and coming off a 35-12 loss at Henderson County. The Mustangs came out with a 12-0 lead early. \n\"We're trying to get the program at a place where we have confidence of winning district games,\" Browning said. \"We went into Henderson County with the belief we could win the game. It was a 14-12 game in the fourth quarter, and it got away from us. We came out there and we battled. We've been looking for improvement every day. \n\"We've progressed weekly, every rep we get in practice we want to get better. A win is great for our program, no matter what. We've had three shutouts. We're growing confidence.\" \nMuhlenberg County knows playing at Reid Stadium will be a challenge. \n\"Matt is doing a great job at Daviess County,\" Browning said. \"He has infused the program with a lot of momentum in the offseason. They got off to great start, they've lost two straight to a couple of really good teams. I'm sure he's got their attention. They've kind of got a new mentality. They want to get physical. We've got to stop the run defensively. \n\"We're going to have to go to Daviess County and match their intensity.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:32:16.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
