I feel even worse for the two captains who did the right thing by telling the other kids on the team to delete the video right away.\n“While I don’t agree with the administration’s decision, I do understand that some action had to be taken. I feel badly that 24 kids are being blamed for the actions of one kid.”\nPolice said the video involved a player changing in the locker room.\nAccording to Driscoll, the first time he heard anything of a video was just before the start of practice on Tuesday.\n“It was right around 2:45 and I was summoned to the office,” he said. “They told me they received an anonymous e-mail about the video and told me to bring the 24 members of the team up to the office with their cell phones. At that point in time, I thought the matter had been handled in-house.\n“I couldn’t believe it the next day when I see this all over the news. Then I look outside my house and there are television trucks out there. I’m just very disappointed that administration took this action, something I really believe happened because of what occurred in Swampscott a week ago.”\nSwampscott forfeited its contest against Saugus last week after learning of inappropriate behavior at a bonfire.\nDriscoll said he has spoken to past and present teams and their families on numerous occasions about upholding the tradition of the football program. He went on to add that he has directly spoken to his team about cellphone use.\n“The cellphone nowadays is really like a loaded gun,” Driscoll said. “We’ve cautioned the players about this. They now see what can happen when someone does something stupid with it.”\nAccording to Driscoll, who has been involved with the program for 17 years, the last nine as head coach, he has received plenty of support, both from inside and outside the community.\n“The first day the news broke, I received more than 75 phone calls from people lending their support to the program and the players,” said Driscoll, who also serves as director for Winthrop Parks and Recreation. “I’ve also gotten phone calls from fellow coaches, including one from a former local coach who now coaches in Texas, and other administrators as well, telling us to keep our heads up.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:39:12.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
