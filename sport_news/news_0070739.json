Check. Erroneous leaks and the unfiltered world of social media drove this story from the start.\nScience? See: ideal gas law.\nLaw? Dealer’s choice. Would you prefer the NFL’s internal judiciary system, or a federal court in New York?\nAnd all surrounding one of the most prolific athletes of all-time.\nMcCann has taught law for 11 years, and has written hundreds of columns as a legal analyst for Sports Illustrated. The professor wants to be clear that this course is no throwaway elective.\nThe first line of his syllabus reads: “This class is not about deflated footballs.”\n“Instead,” it continues, “it is about the interplay between those footballs — along with a number of other sports ‘things’ — and the legal, regulatory and journalistic systems governing sports.”\nIn short, McCann’s social science focuses on the legal aspects first, but covers all corners of the phenomenon.\n“It’s been more complex than I thought it would be. It’s not just discussing Deflategate, although that is an integral part of the class,” UNH freshman Chris Overka said in the classroom last week. “It’s a huge learning experience, it’s not just about the Patriots.”\nMcCann said that about 80 percent of the students in his class self-identify as Patriots fans, but he ensures they check any biases at the door.\n“I force students to take the other side,” he said. “This is not a community for Patriots fans, it’s an undergraduate course designed to talk about the law. As I tell them, good lawyers are able to debate, and they’re able to identify both sides of an argument.”\nMcCann has also booked a slew of guest speakers.\n“We are going to have a lawyer from the NFLPA and a lawyer from the NFL come in and speak later this semester,” he said.\nOn Wednesday, it was Peter King’s turn to step to the plate.\nThe longtime journalist played a unique role in Deflategate.\nTwo days after the AFC Championship Game, Chris Mortensen of ESPN reported that the Patriots had used 11 footballs that weighed two pounds below the legal limit.\nBeing that far under the limit would point undeniably to foul play from the Pats, and this is where Deflategate really blew up.\nKing spoke to a source and wrote an article of his own that confirmed Mortensen’s report.\nProblem: It wasn’t true.\nIn front of a class of 70 students — some dressed in Patriots gear — King explained how to move on from bad sources, and how journalists must respond when they slip up.\n“Understand this,” King said. “In our business, the only thing you can do is stand behind what you wrote, and stand behind what you said. I stood behind what I wrote, and what I said, and it was wrong. Then you have to say, ‘Look, I made a mistake. I erred.’ ”\nKing clearly takes pride in his word, and showed the class that losing any level of reader trust troubles him.\n“I have been sick about it. It really upsets me that I reported that and it turned out to be wrong,” he said. “You just have to live with it.”\nFor three hours, King spoke to the class about his experience in, “the most explosive story” he’s ever covered. Questions were encouraged throughout, and King answered every one. It grew to be more discussion than lecture, and was engaging from start to finish.\nBecause this is a new course, McCann has been able to think outside the box.\nHalfway through the session, McCann and King brought in UNH’s starting quarterback, Adam Reise, for a hands-on science experiment. They had three official NFL balls with varying inflation levels, and the quarterback whizzed passes across the classroom. Reise was able to distinguish the balls, but called the tactile difference nominal.\nIt’s easy to see why Deflategate has been a popular course.\n“Attendance has been great,” McCann said. “Everyone shows up to the classes.”\nAs it stands now, the saga isn’t over. The NFL and NFLPA have another date in federal court set for February in conjunction with the NFL’s appeal. McCann forecasts that things won’t be slowing down anytime soon.\n“This is a controversy that isn’t going away,” he said. “This is going to be with us into 2016.”\nSo, are there any plans for a Deflategate II offering?\n“I’ve thought about it,” the professor said with a laugh. “I guess we’ll see where we’re at in the spring.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:26:17.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
