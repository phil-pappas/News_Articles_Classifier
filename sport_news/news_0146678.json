Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 11:57 pm GIRLS' SOCCER: Creek wins first sectional game ever, will face Floyd in final By ANDREW GREGORY sports@newsandtribune.com News and Tribune \nFLOYDS KNOBS — A two-goal performance by Olivia Scarbrough led Silver Creek to their first sectional victory in program history. \nThe 2-1 win over Mid-Southern Conference-rival Corydon Central advances the Dragons to the championship of the Class 2A Floyd Central Sectional on Saturday against the host Highlanders, who ended Creek's perfect season and ousted it from last year's sectional by a score of 4-2. \nScarbrough opened the scoring with just under 10 minutes gone in the first half for Silver Creek hitting a hard shot past Panthers keeper Kaitlyn Fleace. \nDespite opportunities, including the ball going off of the goalpost on a few occasions, the first half ended with a one-goal differential. \n\"I really don't feel like we played our best. I felt like we were a little nervous, as we should be,\" Dragons coach Pat Anderson said of his team's first half play. \"I just really don't feel like we played a very good game overall.\" \nCorydon's Shelby Megnin received a yellow card as the second half opened, right before a chance for Abi Miller was stopped by Dragons goalkeeper Kylee Sumner. A good save on the other end followed shortly after as Maggie Day struck a point-blank shot that forced Fleace into a tough save before the sophomore hit the goalpost with another shot only a few moments later. \nFleace continued her attempt to keep the Panthers in the game, saving a Scarbrough shot. The Silver Creek senior made up for it a moment later when she found her second goal to give the Dragons a 2-0 lead. \n\"This season, I don't feel like I've played up to my potential,\" said Scarbrough, who was a 2014-15 News and Tribune Player of the Year finalist. \"I came into this game thinking that I was just going to kick the ball as hard as possible. I'm thankful for the opportunities that my teammates gave me tonight.\" \nMegnin pulled Corydon within one goal, striking the ball on a free kick and finding the back of the net with just over 15 minutes remaining, but that would be the final addition to the scoring column in the game. \n\"We were aggressive on the offensive end. We were just unfortunate that not many shots went in,\" Anderson said. \"We got to play on a bigger field than we normally do tonight, so when we play Floyd, we will be more prepared to space the field.\" \nFloyd Central advanced to the final on a 6-0 victory over Jeffersonville in the first contest of the evening, with the six goals coming from six different Highlanders. \n\"I thought we looked very good in the first half,\" Highlanders coach Lewie Stevens said following the victory. \"We have had some things that we were working on that came to pass [in this game], so that was nice to see.\" \nEmma Pappas opened the scoring for the Highlanders in the sixth minute after receiving a pass from Gracie Fitzgerald in the 18-yard box. Junior Zoe Fifer found a pair of assists within five minutes of each other to Alli Kling and Reagan O'Farrell. O'Farrell scored on a header. \n\"I knew that it was sectionals and I knew that we needed to get as many goals as we could,\" Fifer said. \"We made a couple of good passes to get around their defense.\" \n\"We created a lot of goals from one-touch passing, so that is always good to see when you're passing and moving well,\" Stevens added. \nRenee Sisloff continued to increase the Highlander lead as a Reagan O'Farrell shot turned into an assist. Sami Sears made it 5-0 late in the first half as her shot slipped out of the Jeff keeper's hands. \nJeffersonville was able to find a better game in the second half, but Floyd's Erin O'Farrell was the first and only player to find the net with 10 minutes gone after halftime. \n\"We had a good night on Tuesday [ in a 4-1 win over New Albany] and another one tonight. We just have to keep on keeping on into Saturday,\" Stevens said. \"When you're moving the ball well, it will find the back of the net no matter who you're playing.\" \nCLASS 2A FLOYD CENTRAL SECTIONAL \nSEMIFINALS \nFLOYD CENTRAL 6, JEFFERSONVILLE 0 \nJeffersonville 0 0—0 \nFloyd Central 5 1—6 \nSCORING SUMMARY \nFC — Emma Pappas (Gracie Fitzgerald assist), 35:24. \nFC — Alli Kling (Zoe Fifer), 24:13. \nFC — Reagan O'Farrell (Fifer), 20:42. \nFC — Renee Sisloff (R.
