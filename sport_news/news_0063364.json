This time, it's leader Raphael Kirby. (Christy Cabrera Chirinos) \nWith a stretch of six crucial conference games ahead, that's likely to be how Miami approaches every week from here on out, whether their opponent is ranked or not. But there's no doubt Saturday's matchup against the Tigers (6-0, 3-0) might be a little bit more emotionally-charged. \nThe Hurricanes (4-2, 1-1) are looking to carry momentum forward after their victory over the Hokies. After evening their conference record, their long-stated goal of winning the Coastal Division championship and playing for the ACC title remain in play. And more than that, they understand what a victory over a team like Clemson could do for a program — and a coach in Al Golden — that has struggled to find a statement win in recent seasons. \nMiami hasn't beaten a top-10 team since 2009 when the then 17th-ranked Hurricanes upset No. 8 Oklahoma, 21-20. To find the last time an unranked Hurricanes team accomplished that feat you have to go back even further, to 1998 when Edgerrin James ran for 299 yards and Miami shocked third-ranked UCLA 49-45 in a classic game at the Orange Bowl. \nThat Miami win snapped the Bruins' 20-game win streak. While Clemson won't bring a win streak that long to South Florida next week, the Tigers have won their last 34 games against unranked opponents. \nThe Hurricanes will look to end that streak and they'll do so with Kaaya playing at a high level and Miami's defense playing better than it was early in the year, though the unit will have to adjust after the loss of linebacker Raphael Kirby, who hurt his knee Saturday and will have season-ending surgery on Wednesday, Golden said. \nThough Virginia Tech managed seven plays of more than 20 yards Saturday, the Hurricanes had four takeaways in the win, led by Artie Burns' two interceptions. They had three sacks of Hokies quarterback Brenden Motley, a crucial fourth-down stop in the third quarter, and held the Hokies to 3-of-10 on third-down conversions. \nAll are encouraging numbers as the unit prepares to face preseason ACC Player of the Year, Tigers quarterback DeShaun Watson and Clemson, which averages 35 points and 448.5 yards per game. \n\"I think they played better,\" Golden said of his defense's showing against Virginia Tech. \n\"They saw the ball better. Our gap integrity was better. They came to work all week. … We have to get rid of those explosive runs. We hadn't been that last year. We didn't give up many explosive runs a year ago and now we're giving up too many. Gap integrity, have good force, I thought we played hard. We were aggressive.\" \nAdded defensive end Chad Thomas, \"[Clemson's] a big challenge. It's our next game, but we have to focus on heavy next week. Practice, we've got to go hard in practice. We've got to go to meeting rooms, major film [study]. That's just the next game and we've got to take the challenge. They're a [No. 6] team. We're trying to win the game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:52:18.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
