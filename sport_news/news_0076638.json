He’s under investigation for vehicular assault and felony hit and run but prosecutors say it could be several weeks before a decision on charges. \nColeman could play Thursday night at San Francisco, but the Seahawks said team doctors need to check him out first. \nJeanpierre has played for the Seahawks since 2011. He was released last season only to be brought back due to injuries on the offensive line. That’s the likely reason he’s back again – due to some doubt that Patrick Lewis will be ready to play Thursday because of an ankle injury. \nLemuel Jeanpierre #61 of the Seattle Seahawks starts the snap against the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth quarter at Levi's Stadium on November 27, 2014 in Santa Clara, California.

He will not be able to play for eight weeks. \nIt’s still not clear if linebacker Bobby Wagner, who has an injured pectoral, will be ready Thursday. \nRookie cornerback Tye Smith is expected to play after recovering from a hip injury.
