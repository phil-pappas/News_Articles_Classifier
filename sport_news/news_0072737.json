Arsenal beat United 3-0 on Oct.4.\n\"If you want to play at the top of the Premier League you have to do well at home in big games,\" Wenger said.\n\"Our target on Saturday is to take advantage of it, because we play before everybody else.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:46:57.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
