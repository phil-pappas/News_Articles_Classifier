But here in the Windy City, he’s kind of a touchy subject, understandably, even over a pleasant drink on the patio on a balmy fall day.\nAdChoices “We’re trying not to talk about Daniel Murphy, actually,” says Tim Hanley, a 29-year-old bicycle tour guide, as he sat outside Murphy’s Bleachers, the famed establishment across the street from Wrigley.\nThe bar is so close to the ballpark that another well-struck Murphy drive in Game 3 could reach it on a bounce.\n“We don’t want to hear that guy’s name right now,” the lifelong Cub fan adds, laughing. “He had 14 home runs all season and now he’s got five in the playoffs? There might be something going on.”\nMaybe it’s mystical. After all, with the Cubs and a guy named Murphy involved, there’s a long history of funky mojo, some of it goat-themed, dating all the way back to 1908, the Cubs’ last championship.\nTo recap: Some believe Charles Murphy, the unpopular Cub owner in 1908, changed club fortunes when he got sore over being snubbed for a celebration dinner with songwriter George M. Cohan. The goat from the notorious “Curse of the Billy Goat” was named Murphy. GM Johnny Murphy presided over the Mets team that thumped the Cubs in 1969 and broadcaster Bob Murphy described it all. The Cubbies blew the 1984 NLCS by losing three straight at Jack Murphy Stadium, the ballpark named for Bob’s brother.\nAnd now this Murphy, who has homered in each of the first two games as the Mets have taken a 2-0 lead.\n“Mets fans are using any connection they can with the Curse, especially now with Murphy, to work it against the Cubs,” says Bill Sianis, whose family runs the Billy Goat Tavern. “His name is coming up more and more and we’re seeing him on TV more here in Chicago.”\nThe Billy Goat is the old hangout on Michigan Avenue popular with reporters and made famous by the Saturday Night Live skit – Remember “cheezborger, cheezborger, cheezborger?” – and the fact that Sianis’ great uncle, Billy, got the whole curse thing started when he tried to get his goat, Murphy, into Game 4 of the 1945 World Series. The goat, too smelly to root, got kicked out, even though Billy Sianis bought him a ticket.\nWith the Cubs in the hunt again, folks stop in daily to ask if, finally, the Curse is gone, Bill Sianis says. He swears the family wishes only good luck to the Cubs. Newspaper clippings, some by noted Chicago columnist Mike Royko, dot the walls of the place detailing past efforts to remove any hexes.\nBill Sianis says they may try to employ a goat somehow this October to put the right kind of whammy on the Cubbies.\nWhen it comes to Murphy the hitter, other Cub fans have different ideas on how to stop him. “I’d dust him right off the plate,” says 69-year-old Rich Buhrke.\nBuhrke and pal Ken Vangeloff, 53, sat on beach chairs, clutching their baseball gloves, a block or so away from Murphy’s Bleachers – named not for the goat but for the Chicago detective who bought the joint in 1980 – at the intersection of Kenmore and Waveland Avenues. They are “ballhawks,” who try to catch batting-practice homers powered out onto the streets beyond the Wrigley walls. It’s a point of pride for Buhrke, who’s been doing this for 56 years, that he snagged the 299th and 300th homer balls of beloved Cub Ron Santo years ago.\nAt one point, when discussing the various Murphy connections battering the Cubs, Vangeloff says, “Keep going then – was it Mrs. Murphy’s cow, too?” It’s a reference, of course, to Mrs. O’Leary’s cow, which supposedly started the Great Chicago Fire.\nKinda surprising that beast wasn’t a Murphy, eh?\nWhen the ballhawks move on to Murphy and how he’s captivating New York, Vangeloff says, “How crazy are they going to go when the Mets let him go? (Murphy will be a free agent.)”\n“What if he comes to the Cubs?” Buhrke says.\n“The Yankees are going to swoop in and get him,” Vangeloff says. “That’d be a so-Yankees move, overpaying for a headline-getter just to stick it to the Mets.”\nRight now, though, Murphy is a Met and it’s a problem for the Cubs and their fans. How much of one? Here’s what they’re dealing with: “My grandfather is 93,” Hanley says between sips, an elevated train rumbling by in the distance. “He’s a lifelong Cubs’ fan. He’s never seen them win the World Series.\n“That kind of puts it in perspective.”\nWhatever happens, folks in Chicago are sick of hearing about curses. Hanley doesn’t like the one they have, anyway. “What a waste of a curse – a billy goat?” he says. “That’s what we’re blaming it on?\n“The whole thing with Babe Ruth and the Red Sox, that was a real curse. But a billy goat? We can do better than that, can’t we?”\nThey’ll have to stop Murphy first. Then they’ll want to talk about him.\n© Provided by New York Daily News Bil and Sam Sianis, part of the family that runs the Billy Goat Tavern on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, are tired about hearing of yet another Murphy doing his best to keep the Curse going. - Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News © Provided by New York Daily News Inside the Billy Goat Tavern. - Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:37:58.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
