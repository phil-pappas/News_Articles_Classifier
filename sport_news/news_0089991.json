It’s amazing the team took days instead of minutes after the season ended last week to make the news official.\nEvery manager and coach is hired to be fired; that’s just the way things work in sports, right? Someday, believe it or not, Mike Scioscia no longer will be managing the Angels.\nBut Mattingly had seemed on his way out for the better part of two seasons now. Given all the changes the Dodgers have undergone – particularly among the people immediately above the manager’s position – it’s a testament to him that he lasted this long.\nAfter the Dodgers lost to the Mets in Game 5 of the NLDS last week, I was certain Mattingly would be fired and probably within 24 hours.\nIt ended up taking a week to happen, and maybe later Thursday we’ll learn why. During the Dodgers’ anticipated news conference perhaps we’ll find out management actually was considering keeping him.\nI’m not sure I’d believe that with all my heart, but, frankly, I can’t think of any other reason why the Dodgers wouldn’t have made this move sooner.\nAmong our current local professional head coaches, Mattingly always was the next one to go, a good guy who could win just not enough and especially not when it mattered most.\nHis in-game decisions occasionally baffled and there were more and more questions about his handle on the players and how much or how little they had come to respect him.\nMattingly’s heated dugout exchange with Andre Ethier during Game 5 is one you’ll see replayed all day with the news.\nI like Mattingly and had hoped he’d somehow survive, even while knowing there was little chance of that happening.\nSo, as a parting gift, I’ll offer this: Losing to New York wasn’t such a bad way to go out.\nAfter all, the Mets haven’t lost since.\nRelated: Don Mattingly out as Dodgers manager", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/manager-688675-mattingly-angeles.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:38:22.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
