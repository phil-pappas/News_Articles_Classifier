In fact, they'd go on to become the only losing team Kush coached during 22 years in Tempe, finishing 4-7.\nBut they still represented Arizona State, then the pride of the Western Athletic Conference. They'd gone 12-0 in 1975 and finished No. 2 in the AP poll after a fifth bowl victory in six seasons.\nAnd these were still the hapless Utes. \nGoing into Tempe. \nAnd winning.\n\"That was a hell of a game for us,\" said 1976 junior wideout Jack Steptoe, credited for nine catches, 168 yards and two first-half touchdowns in the 31-28 upset. \"We were fired up that game, because we had nothing to lose.\"\n  Utah was coached by Tom Lovat, who holds the distinctions of having Utah's all-time worst winning percentage, at 5-28, and yet being the last Utah head coach to beat ASU.\nNot for lack of trying, either. Despite ASU's move to the Pac-10 in 1978, the two teams have met 11 times since.\nUtah might've snapped the skid in 2013, if not for a go-ahead ASU scoring drive with less than three minutes remaining. Travis Wilson, who threw interceptions on Utah's final two possessions, sustained a concussion that led doctors to discover a pre-existing neurological condition and shut him down for the season.\nIn 2014, the 6-1 Utes were outgained 444 to 241 in Tempe — as Wilson passed for just 57 yards on 22 attempts — and lost in overtime on a missed 35-yarder from Andy Phillips. Poof went Utah's College Football Playoff hopes.\nAnd yet, history be damned, No. 4 Utah entered this week as a touchdown favorite.\nASU coach Todd Graham said at Pac-12 Media Days in July that he felt this was his best team ever — only to be beaten thoroughly twice in his first four games, at No. 9 Texas A&M and against USC.\nBut \"they seem to be hitting their stride\" after wins against UCLA and Colorado, Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said Monday. \nGraham's teams aren't flashy. They typically make few mistakes — ASU's 33 penalty yards per game are fourth-fewest in the nation — and play aggressive defense — tied for fourth nationally with 9.3 tackles for loss per game.\n\"They've got a scheme that they haven't deviated much from since Coach Graham arrived there,\" Whittingham said. \"… You know it's coming, you've just got to block it.\nOn offense, they're led by live-armed senior quarterback Mike Bercovici, who has passed for 1,604 yards, 14 touchdowns and just four interceptions after patiently waiting his turn behind now-graduate assistant Taylor Kelly. \nThe seeming emergence of junior wideout Tim White — who caught seven passes for 144 yards and two of Bercovici's five touchdowns against Colorado — has the Sun Devils finally verging on a full complement of skill players, including running back Demario Richard (529 yards) and versatile senior D.J. Foster (267 yards receiving, 195 yards rushing).\nBut central to their recent success has been the offensive line, with a trio of fifth-year seniors at its core, Whittingham said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:38:28.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
