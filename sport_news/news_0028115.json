(Simon Berlyn | Inset: Associated Press) Neal J. Leitereg Contact Reporter \nMiami Heat forward-center Chris Bosh, who returned to action this month after suffering a career-threatening injury in February, has put his home court in Pacific Palisades back up for lease at $45,000 a month. \nBosh bought the Mediterranean-style home in Pacific Highlands in 2012 for $9.4 million, public records show, and had previously offered the estate for short- and long-term lease. Tenants of note have included actor and musician Donald Glover, who used the property to record his 2013 album “Because the Internet.” \nBuilt in 2001, the massive two-story home behind gates has a resort-style vibe with an infinity-edge swimming pool and swim-up bar, multiple cabanas, a sunken fire pit and a lounge. Views extending from Topanga Canyon to the Pacific Ocean sit in the backdrop of the 1.45-acre site. \nWithin the home, Balinese-inspired interiors dressed in slab concrete and rich hardwoods feature a two-story foyer with a sweeping staircase, a library/office, a chef’s kitchen with wide center island and a wine cellar. A separate entertainment level sports a theater, a wet bar and a billiards room. \nThere are six bedrooms and eight bathrooms in 10,755 square feet of living space. The master suite, centered to take in ocean views, has a fireplace, a sitting room and an exercise room. \nShen Schulz of Sotheby’s International Realty is the listing agent. \nThe NBA star's mansion-estate, on 1.45 acres in Pacific Palisades, includes a home theater, a gourmet kitchen and large formal living spaces in about 10,000 square feet.

After six months of rehab, he returned to the court this month and is expected to return to Miami’s starting lineup this year. \nNow in his 13th year, Bosh has averaged 19.3 points and 8.6 rebounds for his career while making 10 NBA All-Star teams.
