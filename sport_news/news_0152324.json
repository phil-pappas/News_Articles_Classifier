(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)   11:23PM By JAY COHEN, Associated Press \nChicago â€” Oscar Lindberg, Kevin Klein and Derek Stepan scored in the first period, and the New York Rangers ruined Chicago's Stanley Cup party with a 3-2 victory over the Blackhawks on Wednesday on the first night of the NHL season. \nJ.T. Miller had two assists and Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves for New York. \nCheered on by a sellout crowd of 22,104, with many dressed in their usual red jerseys, the Blackhawks raised the banner for the franchise's sixth NHL title during a colorful pregame ceremony. Fluorescent balls bounced around the seats and LED wristbands for the fans provided a synchronized lightshow during player introductions and highlight presentations. \nAll-Star winger Patrick Kane, the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York, heard loud cheers when he skated onto the ice for the Cup celebration. Kane has not been charged. \nArtemi Panarin scored in his first NHL game for Chicago, which is trying to become the first team to defend the title since the Red Wings in 1997-98. Teuvo Teravainen also scored, and Corey Crawford made 24 stops.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:36:38.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
