If he keeps it up, Ervin will zoom past Deonce Whitaker's single-season school record. \nFifteen years ago, Whitaker dashed and darted for 1,577 yards. Ervin is on pace for 1,922. To pass Whitaker, he must average 111 per game over the final seven games. \nErvin is on near-record pace for rushing attempts. At his current average of 24.4 per game, he will finish four carries behind Sheldon Canley's 1990 school record (296). \nBut that's the rub: Ervin is a whopping 177 pounds -- he's not a prototypical workhorse running back. San Jose State's Tyler Ervin celebrates scoreing a touchdown on Fresno State in the first quarter at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, Calif., on Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015. (Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) \nHow much pounding can he take? The Spartans plan to find out. \n\"We're going to keep feeding the ball to the guy who's making big plays,\" said coach Ron Caragher, whose team visits UNLV on Saturday. \nErvin is having a stellar season by any standard: \nHe's second in the Football Bowl Subdivision in total rushing yards, rushing yards per game and all-purpose yards per game (227.6). \nOh, and Ervin also owns the nation's highest single-game totals for rushing yards (300) and attempts (42), both coming against Fresno State. \nAccording to San Jose State, Ervin has the lightest official playing weight of the past 10 running backs to carry the ball at least 40 times in a single game. \nEight of the 10, by the way, were over 200 pounds. Advertisement \n\"He can handle it,\" Caragher said. \"I'm not going to push a player if his body gets worn down. But he's well conditioned. We're going to keep feeding (the ball to) him.\" \nSJSU fans might notice several familiar faces on UNLV's sideline, including defensive coordinator, Kent Baer. \nBaer held the same post at San Jose State from 2008-12 and was the Spartans' interim coach in the Military Bowl. \nHe was the defensive playcaller on Cal's Citrus Bowl team (1991) and did the same for Stanford's Rose Bowl team (1999).
