There’s enormous hype around the film and around everything related to the film, it will also be clashing at the BO with Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees . Here’s everything you wanted to know about the film. Read on...\nWhat\nSalman will play Sultan , the ‘Sher of Haryana’, a wrestler on whom the film will be based. The actor has already started prepping for the role. Salman explains, “I will be bulkier than before. I play a wrestler who, later on, will do a lot of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) in the film.”\nWhen\nKhan begins shooting on November 22. Director Ali Abbas Zafar reveals, “The film will be shot from mid-November to mid-March. There will be one full schedule only.”\nWhere\nThe team completed their recee months back. Says Ali, “The film will be shot in Delhi, Haryana and Mumbai.” There were also reports that to avoid similar locales, Aamir had requested the Sultan team to shoot somewhere else and that Salman had asked the team to build the sets in Mumbai. True? “The film will be shot in real-life locations. Only a few scenes will be shot indoors in Karjat. So no, this is not true,” Ali reasons.\nTraining\nSalman also confirmed that he’s already started training for Sultan . “I uploaded a picture from my training session a few days ago. Don’t ask me, my whole body is paining. Arre baap re! Kahaan kahaan pain ho raha main kya batau (laughs). But these are the initial days. So hopefully in about a week or so, the pain will go.”\nWhat it’s not\nNot like Dangal : Says Ali, “ Dangal is a biopic. My film majorly revolves around the character of Sultan . At heart, it’s a story of one character and it’s all about the fight within. Sultan is completely fictional, but inspiring at the same time.”\nNot like Abhimaan: Says the director, “I have been a huge fan of the film myself and I can assure you it’s not at all like Abhimaan.”\n40, for sure!\nSalman will play a 40-something. Moreover, adds our source, “Salman will put on and lose weight according to the demands of the script. His character will be caught within the same time frame, there’s no time lapse in the film like there is in Dangal , where Aamir plays both an 18-year-old as well as a 50-year-old.”\nTwo looks\nWith his age remaining the same throughout the film, Salman will instead sport two looks. Our khabroo informs us, “He will be muscular first and then he will get leaner.” Which portion are they shooting first? “All depends upon the action director. He will decide which portions to shoot first depending in which state Salman’s body is.”\nHeroine kaun?\nAli keeps the speculation alive. “There will only be one heroine and we will announce it soon.” Also, as we had earlier exclusively told you, the heroine too needs to train in wrestling because the leading lady also is a wrestler in the film.\nAcing Haryanvi\nSays Ali, “Salman will learn Haryanvi and take training sessions to perfect the diction. There will be several Haryanvi dialogues in the film.”\nNo Rekha!\nThe grapevine was abuzz with news of Rekha playing Salman’s mother in the film. But Ali laughs it off. “There is no Rekha in the film.”\nNo villain?\nAn inspirational and aspirational story for the youth, there isn’t any prime antagonist in the film. Our source confirms the same. “As the catchline goes, the demons are within oneself. There won’t be anyone playing the antagonist in the film.”\nNaach-gaana!\nAli affirms, “There will be songs and dances too. It’s a typical commercial film. But the film will have a lot of human emotions and a heart. It won’t just be a masala potboiler.”", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://www.google.com/+nayandeeprakshit"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:13:16.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
