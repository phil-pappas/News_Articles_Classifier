(Bob Dungo Jr.)\n“Yun talaga ang pangarap ko, kasi yun naman yung purpose ko dyan sa NU: para sa UAAP.”\nGorayeb took charge last January but failed to lift the Lady Bulldogs past the UAAP Final Four.\nBut the V-League title victory, despite the presence of guest players Dindin Santiago-Manabat and Rubie De Leon, has boosted NU’s confidence ahead of the UAAP campaign which opens in February.\nGorayeb cited the improvements of Myla Pablo, who was named the Finals Most Valuable Player for her splendid play in Game 3. He also cited Jorelle Singh as capable of providing support for NU’s top star Jaja Santiago.\n“Nakita niyo naman yung improvement nina Myla (Pablo), ni Jorelle (Singh), yung improvement nila sa depensa. Actually, ngayon pa lang nila nakukuha yung mga gusto kong mangyari. Sana magtuluy-tuloy,” Gorayeb said.\nIt was Gorayeb’s second straight title victory this season after steering PLDT to a thrilling win over Army in the Open Conference last June.\nThis time, Gorayeb won at the expense of the Lady Eagles, a team he coached from 2008 to 2013.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:31:10.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
