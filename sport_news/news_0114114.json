Coach: Brian Gregory. \nConference: Atlanta Coast Conference \nKey returners: Swingman Marcus Georges-Hunt is top scorer (13.6), top outside threat and go-to man in the clutch. F Charles Mitchell led team with 7.0 rebounds and 52.1 percent field-goal shooting. PG Travis Jorgenson had minutes regulated last season following knee surgery in December 2013; should be stronger this season. \nWho left: F Demarco Cox was leading shot-blocker who had 15 double-digit scoring games. F Robert Sampson had 15 starts and averaged 6.5 rebounds. G Chris Bolden started 11 games, was 3-point threat. \nThe Skinny: Gregory is under a mandate from athletic director Mike Bobinski to show “clear signs of progress” following his third losing record in four seasons. Transfers Adam Smith from Virginia Tech and Nick Jacobs from Alabama should help.
