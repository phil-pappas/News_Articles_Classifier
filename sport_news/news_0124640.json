His single-game receiving total averaged out to 41.2 yards per catch to place him fourth all-time in the state. \nJunior quarterback Gunnar See and Huff moved to the top of the Jays’ record books with single-game performances and season marks. \n“Once they committed seven guys to the run and matched up one-on-one with Huff, that was dangerous,” Jefferson City head coach Ted LePage said. “Adam made them pay. They doubled Daniel (Ellinger) all night and left no help for Huff.” \nSee broke the single-game passing yardage record with his 374-yard performance against Battle, which also ran his season total to 1,673, putting him atop the list of Jays signal-callers. \nSee surpassed Thomas LePage for both the single-game and season marks. LePage had a 316-yard performance in 2011 and threw for a total of 1,650 yards during the 2012 season. \nHuff’s 247 receiving yards Friday night easily tops the Jefferson City single-game receiving yards list. The previous mark was 188 yards by Roland Mitchell in 2007. \nEllinger’s 161-yard receiving output against Hickman placed him third, just behind Mitchell. Huff’s 146 yards against Rock Bridge two weeks ago sits behind Ellinger. \nHuff’s big game elevated his season total to 651 yards, which is good for first in program history. The spot was recently occupied by Kevin Norri, whose 639 receiving yards held since 2006. \nCurrently, See stands in a tie with Kurt Propst (1996) for second in touchdown passes in a single season with 17. The leader, Justin Gage, threw for 21 in 1998. \nSee also placed sixth in completed passes in a single game with 14 against Battle. Gabe Marcantonio tops the list with 19 from two seasons ago. \nEllinger, a senior, has 410 receiving yards this season, which puts him ninth for reception yardage in a season. Only 44 yards separate Ellinger from the fourth spot, with Mitchell at 454 yards. Ellinger’s 2014 mark of 452 sits in fifth. \nIII \nThe Jays (7-1) shut out Battle (7-1) through the first half and most of the third quarter and came away with three interceptions. \n“(Battle) took some chances and I think our defensive backs did a really nice job of coming up with some real big interceptions,” LePage said. \nBattle wide receiver Jaevon McQuitty did most of the damage. Quarterback Brevinn Tyler found McQuitty nine times for 96 yards and a touchdown. Tyler threw for 192 total yards. \n“Their core receivers are maybe as talented as we’ve seen,” LePage said. “They’re very good and caught some balls. Our biggest issue coming into the game was to not let one go over the top.” \nTyler’s three interceptions on the night matched his season total entering the contest. Isaac Mooreland, Dennis Barnes and Rashaun Woods came up with the giveaways. \n“When you can come up with three interceptions in a game, that’s good,” Jefferson City defensive coordinator Ron Cole said. “I’m really pleased with that number.” \nTyler, the Spartans’ leading rusher, didn’t do much damage with his feet, rushing for just 25 yards. In fact, the Jays held the Spartans to just 61 total yards on the ground. \n“It was pretty evident early that they thought they could run it,” Cole said. “We’ve improved in our tackling and in our team defense in playing as a unit. Everybody took care of their responsibilities.” \nCole said the secondary is peaking at the right time of the season. \n“When we started out we weren’t a very good defense at the start of the year,” Cole said. “Now our secondary is improving and shutting (the long ball) down and making them throw the short stuff. … You try to peak the last three ballgames at the end of the year. I’m glad to see the kids are improving. They’ve got to be at their best in that 10th game.” \nThe Jays will take on Rockhurst (4-4) at 7 p.m. Friday at Adkins Stadium. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:29:44.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
