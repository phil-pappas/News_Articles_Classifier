Among the returnees is at least one certain future Hall of Famer, and one of the faces of the league’s domestic-violence scourge of last season.\nAdChoices Whose return means more to his team, this week and the rest of the season? Here are the top seven players back from suspension. (Three players who served four-game suspensions are unsigned: LB Brandon Spikes, LB Victor Butler and C Ryan Seymour.)\nMORE: Week 5 NFL picks | Power rankings | Week 5 betting lines, odds\n1 TE Antonio Gates, Chargers\n© Provided by Sporting News Suspended for: performance-enhancing substance\nImpact: Without Gates, Philip Rivers leads the NFL in passing yards. Good, right? It’s not how the Chargers wanted to play; they drafted Melvin Gordon to take some of the load off of Rivers. Gates will not only help Rivers, he should open things up for Gordon, too. With Malcom Floyd and Stevie Johnson hurt last week, expect Gates to get a lot of attention.\nMORE: 2016 NFL Mock Draft\n2 LB Rolando McClain, Cowboys\n© Provided by Sporting News Suspended for: substance abuse\nI mpact: The noisy return of Greg Hardy overshadows how much the Cowboys defense also missed the McClain of last season. He’ll slide back into the middle and free fill-in Anthony Hitchens for the outside. With all the holes on offense, getting major pieces back on defense helps enormously.\nMORE: Cursed Cowboys don't get a break, just keep breaking\n3 DE Greg Hardy, Cowboys\n© Provided by Sporting News Suspended for: domestic-violence charge\nImpact: Initially, his crude words have convinced fans who were briefly feeling sorry for the injury-wracked Cowboys, to comfortably despise them again. It goes without saying, though, that someone this reprehensible has to be a great player to be embraced by any team … and Hardy is one of the elite young pass-rushers in the NFL.\nMORE: Unloading on Greg Hardy's 'guns blazing' comment\n4 WR Martavis Bryant, Steelers\n© Provided by Sporting News Suspended for: substance abuse\nImpact: Until Ben Roethlisberger is healthy, Michael Vick will reap the benefits of Bryant’s return. The Steelers’ problems haven’t necessarily come from being short-handed at receiver, with Darrius Heyward-Bey’s surprising production. But adding a guy with eight touchdown catches in 10 games last year never hurts.\nMORE: Five worst moves of the offseason\n5 DE Derek Wolfe, Broncos\n© Provided by Sporting News Suspended for: performance-enhancing substance\nImpact: The Broncos are one of two teams getting back a big contributor to what so far has been a lights-out defense. The line has been dominant, but the end rotation of Antonio Smith, Vance Walker and Kenny Annunike will have to make room for the run-stuffing Wolfe. For defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, it’s one of those welcome problems.\nMORE: Could Denver be potential Matt Forte trade destination?\n6 DE Sheldon Richardson, Jets\n© Provided by Sporting News Suspended for: substance abuse\nImpact: Meet the other ferocious defense beefed up by a suspended player’s return. The Jets are on a bye, so Richardson actually gets back into action in Week 6 against Washington. Without him, the defense has still been a beast, leading the NFL in points allowed and third in yards. Todd Bowles will find a place for him, though, because when he's not messing up off-field, Richardson is great.\nMORE: Betting on Todd Bowles\n7 LB IK Enemkpali, Bills\n© Provided by Sporting News Suspended for: Fighting then-Jets teammate Geno Smith in training camp\nImpact: It’s far from a sure thing Enemkpali will even stay on the team, much less be activate this week in Tennessee. On the other hand, who knows what’s going through Rex Ryan’s mind? He’s angry about last week’s penalty-laden loss and isn’t above using a wild-card like Enemkpali to send some kind of message.\nMORE: Rex Ryan will enforce push-up rule to help curb penalties\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657380-week-5-nfl-power-rankings-giants-jets-packers-bengals-falcons", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657457-nfl-week-5-picks-predictions-patriots-cowboys-seahawks-bengals-redskins-falcons", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-08/greg-hardy-cowboys-guns-blazing-comment-domestic-violence-nfl-light-treatment", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-05/week-4-nfl-cowboys-saints-analysis-reaction-sean-lee-lance-dunbar-injury-update-tony-romo-dez-bryant", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-08/nfl-5-five-worst-offseason-moves-dolphins-eagles-chiefs-texans-colts-free-agents-busts-signings", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-07/rex-ryan-push-up-rule-penalties-buffalo-bills", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657554-nfl-mock-draft-2016-joey-bosa-jaguars-laremy-tunsil-bears-robert-nkemdiche-ramsey-stanley", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657365-nfl-week-5-clay-matthews-kaepernick-49ers-woes-joe-philbin-chip-kelly-todd-gurley-rams/slide/362657", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/list/4657473-nfl-betting-lines-week-5-odds-spreads-vegas-cowboys-patriots-seahawks-bengals", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657588-matt-forte-trade-rumors-options-deadline-teams-cowboys-patriots-broncos", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:26:55.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
