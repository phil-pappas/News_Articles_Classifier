Mark Welsh | Staff Photographer Port Barrington's Susie Mingee Mackerel fish plate is healthy and low in calories. Mark Welsh | Staff Photographer The dish I prepared was Holy Mackerel Patties over Arugula with Lemon Sauce. I chose this dish because I love making salmon patties from canned salmon and the canned mackerel was very comparable. I was excited to cook a family meal with the mystery ingredients because mackerel is high in omega 3s, chickpeas in fiber, arugula and lemons part of our daily five. My low during this process was finding out mackerel has just a little stronger of a taste than salmon. My high was balancing out the stronger taste with a little extra lemon juice and a delicious lemon sauce. I incorporated chickpeas into the patty recipe in order to add extra fiber to my family's diet. My testers loved the recipe so much they asked me to make it again! I was surprised by how much I loved the taste of mackerel. I had never had it before. It will most definitely become a new staple in my home. I feel very thankful for this wonderful experience! It is so much fun making up new recipes and trying new ingredients. -- Mary J.
