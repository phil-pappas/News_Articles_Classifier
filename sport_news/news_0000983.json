After Babcock made it clear in previous days, both publicly and privately, that the man many have deemed to be the starting goalie simply had to be better, Bernier was exactly that before an announced crowd of 17,762. \nBernier could do only so much, however. After his teammates couldn’t produce many scoring opportunities during regulation, they were unable to bury some prime chances in overtime. \nMatt Moulson, the fifth Buffalo shooter in the shootout, beat Bernier with a deke and Brad Boyes was then stopped by Chad Johnson, enabling the Sabres to skate off the ice with a 2-1 win. \n“He challenged me behind (closed) doors and that’s part of the job,” Bernier said, referring to Babcock. “I have to be better and you have to take it, you can’t take it too personal. \n“I really wanted to come out and be focused all night. I’m frustrated I didn’t win.” \nAs the Leafs continue to learn under Babcock, it’s crucial for the netminder to find a rhythm, whether it’s Bernier or James Reimer. As much as Babcock wants his team to be aggressive in the offensive zone and control the play, it’s not going to come right away to a group that has had major possession issues in the past. \nThe goalie has to be sharp to cover up defensive-zone troubles and Bernier was fine in that regard until just 4 1/2 minutes remained in the third period. \nThere was nothing Bernier could do about a Nazem Kadri giveaway. Kadri was falling to the ice when he put the puck on the stick of Evander Kane. In a blink, the puck was over Bernier’s glove and into the top corner. \nThat tied the game 1-1, the goal coming after the Sabres had kept the Leafs hemmed in their own zone for much of the period. \nKadri failed to score on a couple of terrific chances in overtime, and James van Riemsdyk nearly scored as time expired. \nOnly because of Bernier did the Leafs, who fell to 1-3-2, have a shot at two points. \n“I thought our goalie was really strong, which is really important,” Babcock said. “He has been a goalie in the NHL for a while and he has been a good goaltender. When you are trying to make a decision every day on who should start, it’s no fun for the coach either. It’s good that a guy who is supposed to be starting all the time grabs the ball and runs with it. It makes you a better team.” \nCrucially, Bernier was sharp early and had a lead to work from. \nP.A. Parenteau scored his first goal as a Leaf at 1:28 of the first period, tipping a Roman Polak shot past Johnson. It was the first time in six games this season the Leafs scored the opening goal. The 1-0 lead after 20 minutes came after the Leafs had been outscored 6-1 in the first period in their previous five games combined. \nYet Toronto could not generate a lot afterward and was outshot for the second time in 2015-16 as Johnson faced 24 shots on goal. \nBabcock was not thrilled that no call was made on Kane after the forward collided with captain Dion Phaneuf in the third. Phaneuf’s blood on his upper lip wasn’t enough for a penalty, and he was required to get stitches. \nToronto, without defenceman Jake Gardiner because of an undisclosed injury and centre Tyler Bozak because of a lower-body injury, has won just two of its past 18 games in Buffalo. \n“One of those nights we did not have everything going in the right direction and it cost us,” defenceman Matt Hunwick said. “(Bernier) kept us in it. He bounced back after a couple of early goals in Pittsburgh (last Saturday) and carried it through. He played excellent.” \nterry.koshan@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:41:41.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
