He struck out eight without a walk in the kind of clutch performance the Royals expected when they traded for him.\nWhen Wade Davis breezed through the ninth, the Royals poured onto the field to celebrate.\nThe defending AL champs will host the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 on Friday night. The teams have met once before in the ALCS with the Royals winning in seven games in 1985 — they would go on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals for their only World Series triumph.\n  houston astros ,  johnny cueto ,  kansas city royals ,  mlb playoffs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:19:59.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
