Our top 10 teams will have a brief synopsis on why they were selected. \nIn the time we were away, our No. 1 team lost, two others in our top 10 proved to be pretenders and No. 7 Louisiana State took a big leap up the rankings because of its No. 7 Leonard Fournette. \nNow that every SEC school has played at least one conference game, and nine of the ACC teams have played at least one conference game — Pittsburgh, Virginia Tech, North Carolina and N.C. State have their conference openers this weekend — head-to-head will play a larger role than it has previously. \n1. Louisiana State (3-0) When Herschel Walker says that a running back is better than he was when the former Heisman Trophy winner was in college, as he did about Fournette this week, it’s high praise indeed. The Tigers have played 180 minutes of football this season and not trailed in a single one of them. LW: 7 \n2. Mississippi (4-0) The Rebels, averaging 543 yards per game, lead the SEC in total offense by more than 50 yards. It’s one thing to do that against a pillow-soft non-conference schedule, and another to rack up the points and yards in conference play. Don’t be surprised if Mississippi leaves prominent Gators crying again after Saturday’s trip to The Swamp. LW: 6 \n3. Georgia (4-0) Mark Richt’s team is more than Nick Chubb and 10 others on offense. The Bulldogs lead the SEC in rushing offense with 1,031 yards and 14 rushing touchdowns. Like Louisiana State, the Bulldogs have not trailed at any point in the season. LW: 2 \n4. Florida State (3-0) Florida State has not blown teams away, but the Seminoles have a larger margin for error than the last year because they have only committed one turnover in three games and one of the least penalized teams in the ACC. Running back Dalvin Cook leads the ACC in rushing yards and may pad those totals against a Wake Forest defense that let Indiana’s Jordan Howard run for 168 yards and a touchdown last week. LW: 4 \n5. Clemson (3-0) We’ll know more about the Tigers after this week’s game against Notre Dame. One statistic that bodes well for Clemson is the Tigers are fourth in the country in third down conversion defense. Combine the fact that Notre Dame quarterback Deshone Kizer will be starting his first road contest, and Clemson may have enough to finally win. LW: 5 \n6. Texas A&M (4-0) The Aggies have yet to leave the Lone Star State for a football game, meaning their record and results may be a mirage. Since Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott has proven immune to turnovers so far this year, the Aggies may need to use its pass rush, which has a SEC-best 17 sacks — to corral the Bulldogs quarterback. Don’t sleep on A&M freshman Christian Kirk, who has caught 100 percent of the passes targeted his way for 442 yards and four touchdowns. LW: 8 \n7. Mississippi State (3-1) The aforementioned Prescott has completed 67 percent of his passes for 1,069 yards and seven passing touchdowns and two more rushing touchdowns. The Bulldogs defense is not as salty as last year, but the 14.8 points per game it allows is tied for 14th nationally. LW: 10 \n8. Alabama (3-1) The Crimson Tide still have a very good defense, as evidenced by the 267 yards per game and 3.9 yards per play allowed. The question is whether they can hold onto the football. In its last seven games against ranked opponents the Tide have committed one turnover or less four times. Not coincidentally, Alabama is 4-0 in those contests and held opponents to 20 or fewer points four times. In the other three games, Alabama has lost two of them and allowed an average of 40.6 points. LW: 1 \n9. Duke (3-1) The Blue Devils have played two good teams and split results against Northwestern and Georgia Tech. Quarterback, and Baker County graduate, Thomas Sirk leads the ACC with 283.8 offensive yards per game. Sirk has accounted for eight touchdowns in his first four games as the Blue Devils starting quarterback. LW: 12 \n10. Florida (4-0) The Gators showed grit in overcoming a 13-point deficit against Tennessee last week. However, that shows more about the Volunteers than it does the Gators. As of Saturday, there were only three instances where a team led by 13 or more points in the fourth quarter and proceeded to lose. Tennessee owns two of those losses. LW: 13 \n11. Georgia Tech (2-2)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:22:12.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
