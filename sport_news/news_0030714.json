But we feel he’s earned that spot.”\nLarkin spoke with the media after Monday’s practice but before he was told he had made the team.\nLarkin said he was “not stressing” about the decision.\n“I’m just set to play,” Larkin said. “The whole summer I didn’t know my future.\"\nIn fact, Larkin seemed resigned to the fact that he might have to start in Grand Rapids.\n“I’d take it as the best experience of my life,” said Larkin of this training camp. “To make it this far on an NHL team is quite an accomplishment.”\nLarkin impressed everyone in the Red Wings front office, coaching staff, and locker room with his maturity level and talent, and hockey sense on the ice.\nDylan Larkin moves the puck during a camp practice in September.   (Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nPlaying against top players such as Chicago’s Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane, Pittsburgh’s Sidney Crosby and Boston’s Patrice Bergeron, Larkin didn’t look out of place.\n“I learned what kind of player I can be playing against the best,” said Larkin. “I’m not saying right now (I'm with those players) but I can be that kind of player.\n“It’s awesome being here and it would be a dream come true (to make the Wings). It’s something I’ve always wanted and I worked for my whole life and dreamed about.”\nLarkin was skating on a line with Henrik Zetterberg and Justin Abdelkader Monday, although Blashill wouldn’t commit to that line going forward.\n“That’s always a day-to-day stuff,” Blashill said. “You know with injuries and stuff. But what we’ve looked at is starting him with Z and Abby. That’s something we talked about. But that could change come Friday.”\nPlayers and coaches have been impressed with Larkin throughout the exhibition season.\nFormer Red Wings coach Mike Babcock, now with Toronto, wasn’t surprised by Larkin’s development.\n“I saw him at Michigan and saw him at the world championships (in May) and he’s obviously an elite player,” Babcock said. “Unbelievable legs and better drive train, he competes hard and works hard. He looks to me like a real good player.”\nSaid goaltender Jimmy Howard: “He’s going to be a special player. It’s going to be fun watching him develop. His speed -- it’s lightning fast, and he sees the ice, even with the speed that he generates.”\nThe Red Wings will likely waive Daniel Cleary before Tuesday’s 5 p.m. roster deadline. Darren Helm (shoulder separation, concussion), who is on short-term injured reserve, probably isn’t ready to start the season in Detroit.\nHelm skated briefly Monday but left the ice before practice began.\n\nted.kulfan@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tkulfan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:16:21.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
