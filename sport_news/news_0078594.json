Wide receiver Nick Lorden had just caught an apparent touchdown pass that would help draw the Cardinals even with just under seven minutes to play in the third quarter. But, Lorden was called for offensive interference on the play, and it was mostly downhill for the Cardinals after that en route to a 35-29 loss at the hands of the 8-0 Grizzlies. Not only did the Cards fall to 5-3, setting up a likely must-win against Nashua South on Friday night in order to win the West Conference and secure a playoff berth, they will apparently go into that game shorthanded. BG quarterback Jordan Hiscoe (17 of 30, 201 yards, two TDs, one INT) suffered a left ankle injury and left the game for good with just over eight minutes to play. Then, to make matters worse, receiver Dylan Fagan hurt his neck after catching a pass near the goal line with just over two minutes to go and BG down 35-21. Fagan could move his extremities but was taken away by ambulance as, according to BG coach Jeff Moore, \"hopefully\" as a precaution. \"It was a costly game in terms of injuries,\" Moore said. \"We said in the (post-game) huddle that we can't have the four or five mistakes that we made against a real good team. Honestly, they're a real good team, as good as it gets, we know that, and we just have to play a cleaner game.\" Besides Lorden's TD being taken away, the Cards had two other critical miscues. Down 14-7 but on the move to perhaps tie the game with a first down at the Grizzlie 21 with 9:22 left in the half, the Cards watched in horror as a shotgun snapped zipped past Hiscoe. The QB dove on it but the ball popped out and was eventually scooped up by Goffstown's Pat Leahy, who took it 48 yards to paydirt. That made it 21-7, Goffstown. \"We knew we'd have a tough one today, but our kids responded,\" Goffstown coach Justin Hufft said. \"It (the fumble) was big. It put us up by a couple of scores. They were marching. We work on scooping it forward, recovering fumbles.\" Guertin closed to within 21-13 on a Hiscoe 9-yard TD pass to Lorden with 1:43 remaining in the half. But the second half started out in disastrous fashion as Goffstown's Connor Bourque returned the opening kickoff 75 yards to make it a 28-13 game. Guertin answered quickly with a Jackson Housman 3-yard TD run and a Hiscoe two-point conversion pass to Lorden. But with 1:02 left in the period, Goffstown quarterback Casey Gervais ran in from 4 yards out and that put the Grizzlies up by two scores again, 35-21. Ironically Gervais, who ran for 91 yards and threw for 72, was gimpy after that play and did not return. Guertin actually led early on 7-0 on a 9-yard pass from Hiscoe to Fagan but the Grizzlies got a 2-yard TD run from Bourque late in the first to help tie it and a 5-yard Gervais TD run early in the second to take the lead for good. The Cards, behind backup QB Sam Raitt, forced the game to come down to an on-side kick. Raitt scored from 3 yards out with 1:32 left to help make it 35-29, but Goffstown easily recovered the ensuing kick and ran out the clock. \"The kids played hard, they played right to the end,\" Moore said. \"We've just got to play a cleaner game.\" As for Fagan, Moore said that he was alert, able to move his fingers and toes, but had a sensation in the back of his neck. \"He was alert, communicating, moving all his fingers and toes,\" Moore said. \"It's just he had a sensitive spot in the back of his neck. Mostly precautionary, we hope. They were just worried about the tenderness (in the neck area).\" Top Jobs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:22:32.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
