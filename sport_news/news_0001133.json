Yet another loss by either the Panthers or the Maroon Tide will in all likelihood eliminate any hopes of hosting a first round game in the upcoming Class 5A South State playoffs. This series was once dominated by Picayune, until Lewis Sims arrived at War Memorial Stadium. Since 2011, The 'Yune leads the series 4-2, but 'Goula has won the last two games played on Dutch Binion Field. Either Picayune (3) or Pascagoula (1) has won the last four Region 4-5A titles. Both teams have hosted first round playoffs games the past two years, and the Maroon Tide has hosted four straight seasons. As usual, there's a lot on the line when Pascagoula and Picayune pair up. Ocean Springs at Gulfport: This one is for all the marbles in Region 4-6A, as the Greyhounds travel to Milner Stadium to face the Admirals Friday night. Both teams sit atop the league standings, tied with perfect 5-0 marks, and both have already secured opening round home games in the upcoming Class 6A South State playoffs. The winner will take the top seed in the region race, no matter what happens in the final week of the regular season. The Greyhound have won six of their last nine games against GHS, but the teams have split the last four contests. A win will give OSHS their fourth league crown since a statewide playoffs system was implemented in the early 1980's, but it would mark the first time ever the Greyhounds have won back-to-back region titles. Resurrection at Lumberton: The battle for supremacy in Region 4-1A takes place in Lamar County, as the top-ranked and unbeaten Eagles face the homestanding Panthers. A win by RCS gives them their first ever league title and home field advantage in the opening round of the Class 1A South State playoffs for the second straight season. Even a loss would keep the Eagles in contention for part of a crown and a first round home game, as Lumberton still has to play Stringer in its regular season finale. As of now, RCS and LHS sit at 4-0 atop the league standings, and the Red Devils are 4-1 with their only league loss coming to the Eagles. St. Martin at George County: The Yellow Jackets dropped a heart breaking last second decision to arch-rival Ocean Springs last week, and need a win on the road in Gill-Martin Stadium in Lucedale over the Rebels to enhance their playoff chances. George County snapped a four game losing streak with a win over Biloxi last week, and the Rebels are looking for at least one more win in the regular season in order to record their first winning season in five years. St. Martin hasn't made the state playoffs in 13 years. East Central at Vancleave: This long time rivalry is renewed Friday night in a key Region 8-4A game, and the outcome will be discussed for months to come in deer stands and duck blinds throughout Jackson County. While there's not much on the line for the Hornets playoff wise, having already clinched second place, head coach Seth Smith's squad can notch as many as seven wins in a season for ECHS for the first time in 13 years with a win. On the other side, the season is on the line for the Bulldogs. Moss Point also hosts Bay High Friday night in a game with postseason implications. We discussed the playoff possibilities in Region 8-4A earlier here.... http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-news/2015/10/playoff_forecast_for_region_8-.html#incart_river_home", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:54:16.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
