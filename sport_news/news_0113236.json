Show Caption \nFarragut High School's volleyball team denied Siegel's shot at program history on Thursday. \nNow the Lady Admirals will try to claim what eluded them a year ago. \nFarragut won three elimination games on Thursday at Blackman High School, including a 25-21, 25-19, 25-23 victory over Siegel that pushed it into the Class AAA state final against Brentwood at 4 p.m. Friday at Middle Tennessee State's Murphy Center in Murfreesboro. \nFarragut fell to Brentwood in five sets in last season's championship match. The two-time defending state champion also beat the Lady Admirals in straight sets in the second round on Wednesday. \n\"This is the exact pattern we had last year,\" Farragut coach Susan Davidson told The Daily News Journal. \"Siegel has a bunch of awesome kids. They never gave up. (Coach Shawn Robinson) does a great job with them.. \n\"Siegel's hard to play when you are coming off a five-set game with Houston.\" \nThe Lady Admirals (48-6) left the Lady Stars one win shy of their first berth in a state championship match. Siegel finished third for the third consecutive year. \nLike last year, Farragut knocked off Germantown Houston in the losers bracket semifinal to stage an elimination game with Siegel. \nFarragut beat Franklin in straight sets in its first match on Thursday. \nAlexis Parker led Farragut with 21 kills in the decisive match against Siegel, hammering the ball from the front row and the back row. Shelby Grace Rawls added eight kills and five blocks. Madi Howell had nine aces, six kills and 14 digs. \n\"We all had the mindset that we were going to play through being tired,\" Parker said. \"I think we just acted like it was the next game and we were fresh.\" \nHouston def. Bearden 25-21, 25-23, 25-19: The Lady Bulldogs' hopes for a second-day rally were dashed early in the losers bracket. Bearden, making its first state appearance since 2012, finishes the season 22-17. \nThe Daily News Journal contributed to this report. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
