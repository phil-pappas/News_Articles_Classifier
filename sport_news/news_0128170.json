The GC32 and the way its foils are configured make it forgiving for high-speed sailing. We were loving it.” \nPercy, another Olympic champion, was on board Sultanate of Oman to call tactics, but on Saturday, he was just enjoying the ride. “That was a lot of fun and we are pleased we managed to help Sultanate of Oman win the Bullitt GC32 Racing Tour this season. It’s been a good learning curve for us and we’ve gained a lot from our time racing the boat here.” \nAfter the light winds of the previous day, Morgan Larson was steeling himself for battle with Spindrift racing and Sultanate of Oman, both of whom were close enough on points to take the Marseille victory away from the Swiss team on board Alinghi. \n“It’s a pity we didn’t get any racing today, but we learned a lot from watching those boys on Sultanate of Oman blasting around,” said the American, who took a more gentle approach. “A while back, I thought foiling was a bit of a fad, but clearly it’s here to stay. It’s awesome, we’re learning more every day.” \nDavid Graham, the CEO of Oman Sail, praised the team’s efforts, saying, \"We are privileged to work with such driven athletes. Our sailors joined this circuit with one objective - to win - and they knew that achieving their goal wasn't going to be easy, especially with an impressive line-up of experienced competitors. The team has a great leader, depth of knowledge, a determined Omani [in Nasser al Mashari] and some impressive teamwork.\" \nResults: GC32: 1 Sultanate of Oman (10 pts), 2 Alinghi (11), 3 Spindrift racing (14), 4 ARMIN STROM Sailing Team (20), 5 Team ENGIE (21). \nMarseille One Design: 1 Alinghi (42 pts), 2 Spindrift racing (45), 3 Sultanate of Oman (47), 4 Team ENGIE (57), 5 ARMIN STROM (66).
