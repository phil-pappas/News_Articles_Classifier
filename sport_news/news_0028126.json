For the second consecutive week, Kill pulled Mitch Leidner in the fourth quarter, replacing him with freshman Demry Croft. But Saturday’s circumstances were very different. Instead of trailing by 27 points, as the Gophers were last week at Northwestern, they held a 32-point lead over Purdue. Leidner threw two touchdown passes, and Shannon Brooks scored on a spectacular 71-yard run, as the Gophers pulled away in the third quarter for a 41-13 rout at Ross-Ade Stadium. The Gophers’ (4-2, 1-1 Big Ten) three previous wins all came by three points in nonconference play. They got exactly what they needed — a comfortable win. It was their most lopsided Big Ten victory since their 51-14 win over Iowa last November. “I just think that we just had to get back to being who we are,” Kill said. “We had a makeshift offensive line, started a true freshman [Tyler Moore at center]. But sooner or later, you can’t make excuses.” Robert Ndondo-Lay (92) celebrated with Minnesota defensive back Jalen Myrick (5) after Myrick returned an interception for a touchdown during third quarter. Purdue (1-5, 0-2) was trying to build off last week’s three-point loss to No. 4 Michigan State, but fell to 1-17 in Big Ten games under third-year coach Darrell Hazell. This one was another dogfight for the Gophers — for one half. They went to halftime with a 10-6 lead, knowing the first drive of the second half would be important. Brooks gave them 5 yards on the first play. On the second play, he took the handoff and burst through a big hole on the right side of the line. Purdue had all kinds of chances to tackle him — six defenders put hands on him — but he broke away for a 71-yard touchdown. “I’m a physical runner, so I really didn’t try and make a lot of moves,” Brooks said. “I just try and run through people.” Brooks, a true freshman from Jasper, Ga., got the start at tailback and rushed 17 times for 176 yards. The Gophers wound up scoring four touchdowns in the third quarter. The second one came when Leidner rolled right on a bootleg play. Tight end Brandon Lingen headed toward the left corner uncovered. Leidner stopped, turned and hit Lingen for the 3-yard touchdown. On the next drive, Leidner put a perfectly placed pass in Lingen’s hands for a 17-yard touchdown. With the Gophers rushing for 326 yards on the day, Leidner didn’t have to pass much. He completed eight of 12 passes for 59 yards, with one interception. Shannon Brooks ran 23 yards for a first down during second quarter. Croft came in and completed two of five passes for 7 yards. He rushed for 34 yards on one play, setting up a Ryan Santoso field goal. Purdue’s offense hit a wall against the Gophers defense after a touchdown on the game’s opening drive. After that, the Boilermakers went 11 consecutive drives without a point. Purdue redshirt freshman quarterback David Blough had a rough day, going 21-for-49 for 207 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions. Jalen Myrick had two of those interceptions and returned the second one 27 yards for a touchdown. Jack Lynn and Alex Keith applied pressure on Blough on that throw, which went right to Myrick. The Gophers defense had gone three straight games without creating a turnover. They created two in the first half, as Purdue fumbled a punt and threw an interception. Minnesota couldn’t capitalize on the fumbled punt, as Santoso missed a 50-yard field goal wide right. But Myrick intercepted a pass from Blough midway through the second quarter, giving the Gophers the ball at Purdue’s 37-yard line. Brooks had runs of 9 and 23 yards, and Leidner scored on a 1-yard sneak. The Gophers overcame another rough start, as they have scored just three first-quarter points all season. Purdue started the game with a 13-play, 75-yard touchdown drive. Senior receiver Danny Anthrop beat true freshman Antonio Shenault on a post pattern, and Blough hit him with a 41-yard pass. Purdue converted on fourth-and-1 from the 2-yard line, and D.J. Knox punched it in on the next play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:00:08.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
