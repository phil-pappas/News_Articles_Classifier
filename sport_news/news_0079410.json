Joe Mahoney AP i \nmbarrows@sacbee.com SANTA CLARA -- \nJim Tomsula said the 49ers are monitoring linebacker NaVorro Bowman's snap count as he continues to come back from a major knee injury but hedged when asked if Bowman could benefit from a rotation at his position. \n\"In the passing downs and things like that ... but we don't want him off the field, you know what I mean?\" Tomsula said. \"Yeah, we're looking at those things. We're looking at monitoring reps.\" \nBowman and the 49ers defenders didn't play many snaps in the first two games, 54 and 56 respectively. But they've been on the field quite a bit in the last three outings: 74 snaps against the Cardinals, 73 vs. the Packers and 79 Sunday against the Giants. \nBowman, meanwhile, is clearly not back to full speed, especially when dropping into coverage and moving side to side. Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco said he's noticed that while studying up on his Sunday opponent. \n\"I think laterally and some of the man-coverage-type things -- which he's not in a ton of positions to be in -- some of that stuff I think you might be able to see that he's coming back a little bit,\" Flacco said. \"But as far as being a leader over there and coming down hill and being able to tackle and things like that -- straight-line things -- I think he's himself, and he's still playing at a high level.\" \nThe scouting service Pro Football Focus ranks Bowman 14th out of 51 inside linebackers. He has a 5.2 grade against the run but a minus-5 grade in coverage. Teammate Michael Wilhoite ranks 44th on Pro Football Focus’ list with a minus-3 grade against the run and a minus-5.3 grade against the pass. \nThe 49ers last week traded for an inside linebacker, Gerald Hodges, who was inactive for the Giants game. Tomsula said he liked the way Hodges was eager to pick up the 49ers system and that the newcomer has made a good first impression. \nCould Hodges be part of a rotation? Tomsula reiterated that Hodges was brought in because the 49ers have liked him since the 2013 draft. \n“In terms of Bowman, I’m a Bow fan, a Bow guy,” he said. “Bow plays a lot of good football. And I’m excited about Bow.” \nMatt Barrows: @mattbarrows , read more about the team at sacbee.com/sf49ers .
