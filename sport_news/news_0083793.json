Advertisement - Continue Reading Below “Whatever they want to do, that’s what they’ll do,” said Brady. “And I’ll do my best to support the things they love. I’ve found things I love.” Brady eldest son, John is eight years old, and Brady said he isn’t fully into the game yet. So don’t start filming the “ Book of Brady ” yet. Brady imagined watching his son play, and said, “I’m sure I’ll be very, very nervous.” A number of athletes—particularly quarterbacks like Troy Aikman, Brett Favre, Drew Brees and Kurt Warner—have expressed some hesitancy about letting their kids play the sport. Terry Bradshaw said if he had a son, he “ would not let him play football .” Brady, however, sees value in the lessons football teaches its players. “Well, I think that there’s a certain part of football—contact sports I would say in general—that I really endorse,” he said. “When you have to make a commitment like we make as football players to your health and well-being, there’s a certain discipline that comes with that in your life in general.” Brady explained that there’s no physical accountability for mistakes in non-contact sports like baseball. A pitcher who allows a home run doesn’t get slammed to the turf like a quarterback might if he reads a defense incorrectly. “If you don’t prepare, you pay the price physically,” Brady said. “It’s your body—you only have one body. ... Everything takes a toll if you don’t commit yourself the right way.” If they play, they should take after their father, who has become one of the best-prepared players in the NFL.
