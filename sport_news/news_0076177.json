Chris Macias cmacias@sacbee.com i \ncmacias@sacbee.com \nGibson Ranch filled Saturday with high-wattage guitar riffs and an equally large volume of traffic. \nThe two-day Monster Energy Aftershock Festival kicked off to a sold-out crowd of 25,000, with another 20,000 expected Sunday to rock out to such headliners as Faith No More, Jane’s Addiction and Sacramento’s own Deftones. \nBy mid-afternoon, a normal drive from midtown to Gibson Ranch, which normally takes about 20 minutes, was stretched into an epic 2 1/2 -hour trip. Traffic was backed up more than a mile on a stretch of Watt Avenue leading to the concert’s 200-acre parking lot, leaving a litany of frustrated comments on Twitter by concertgoers. \nThe festival is the largest event held at Gibson Ranch in Elverta, a county park that’s operated privately by real estate developer and former congressman Doug Ose. Aftershock is certainly testing the 325-acre park’s capacity to hold large scale concerts, especially following significant traffic issues and other organizational snafus following City of Trees, which drew 9,000 to Gibson Ranch in August. The festival moved to Gibson Ranch this year following a three-year run at Discovery Park. \nJeremiah Hunt of Fairfield opted to take a cab from his hotel, only to be dropped off about a mile from the concert site. Once inside, he joined up with the thousands of hard rock fans jockeying for space at one of Aftershock’s four stages, or chilling out on the grassy areas near a fleet of food trucks. \n“I lost my friends,” said Hunt, eager to see Slipknot, Saturday’s headliner. “But it’s been going good. (Aftershock) kind of outgrew Discovery Park. It’s perfect here.” \nCheck sacbee.com throughout the weekend for more news and photos from Aftershock. \nChris Macias: 916-321-1253 , @chris_macias \nMonster Energy Aftershock Festival \nWhat: Festival headliners includes the Deftones, Jane’s Addiction, Slipknot, Faith No More, Marilyn Manson, Breaking Benjamin and many more. \nWhen: Noon-midnight Saturday; noon-11 p.m. Sunday \nWhere: Gibson Ranch, 8556 Gibson Ranch Park Road, Elverta \nCost: $114.50-$134.50 weekend ticket; $64.50-$74.50 single-day ticket; $15 parking Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:16:27.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
