(PRWEB) October 13, 2015\nColdscreen , a lotion that allows for fewer layers and more warmth in the cold months, has launched on Indiegogo to raise $40,000 in 34 days. This fast-acting warming lotion works with the body’s natural chemistry to safely retain heat for up to four hours while you are outdoors doing the activities and sports you love.\n“We believe cold weather should never be a deciding factor for a great time outdoors,” Ryan Tattle, U°THERMIC co-founder, said. “Our goal is to change the way people feel about cold weather and help ensure you never have to put a good time on hold just because you’re cold or your bulky winter clothes get in the way.”\nApplied just like a lotion, Coldscreen contains 98% natural ingredients and includes no harmful chemicals. The moisturizing, non-greasy formula is chock-full of high-quality ingredients that are safe for your skin such as coconut oil, jojoba, aloe and even a kelp extract from Antarctica.\nColdscreen has gone through rigorous clinical tests and is dermatologist approved, even for sensitive skin. Additionally, Coldscreen has been tested in the elements, such as the French Alps and in Helsinki, where even six-degree celsius weather didn’t stop participants from wearing shorts and a tank top comfortably.\nAccording to a recent study of Coldscreen’s new formula, 97% of participants felt the full effects of Coldscreen in just five to fifteen minutes, getting them back to having fun and feeling warm in no time at all. With Coldscreen, adventures don’t have to be put on hold just because the weather isn’t sunny and 75. Hunting, hiking, running, rock climbing or even going to the grocery store in the winter no longer require heavy, bulky clothing that tends to get in the way.\nColdscreen is now available for pre-order on Indiegogo. There are multiple early bird perks beginning at $15 for a 2.7 oz. bottle and $20 for a 5.1 oz. bottle. Additional reward opportunities include a weekend in Colorado and full day ski lessons with a professional. Also a behind-the-scenes documentary of the inner workings and all the tips and tricks of a crowdfunding campaign is available.
