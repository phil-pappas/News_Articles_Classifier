INCHEON, South Korea — The Presidents Cup wasn’t an hour old when Nick Price looked at the scoreboard and had that sinking feeling.\nIt was filled with American red.\nAnd there wasn’t much the International team or its captain, Price, could do about it Thursday in an opening session that ended just like so many others in this one-sided affair.\nPhil Mickelson and Zach Johnson capped off a performance that was as businesslike as their handshakes, and the Americans had a 4-1 lead after foursomes in which they never trailed in any match except the one they lost.\n\"A tough day for us,\" Price said. \"Having said that, we are only five points into 30. We still have another 25 points left out there. So we’ve got a long way to go, and that’s that I told my team. Just to keep their chins up and do the best they can [today].\" \nThe International team was adamant that the number of matches be reduced — it was lowered from 34 to 30 — to keep it a close contest. After one day, maybe having one less match on Thursday helped.\nIt could have been worse.\nThe Americans, who have lost the Presidents Cup only one time since it began in 1994 and are going for their sixth straight victory, had a lead after the opening session for the fifth straight time. The margin was their largest since a four-point lead in 2007 at Royal Montreal.\nThat makes the five matches of fourballs today even more critical.\nAmerican leads LPGA \nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — American Alison Lee shot a 6-under 65 on Thursday for a share of the first-round lead with China’s Xi Yu Lin in the LPGA Malaysia. \nLee, who is 20, birdied five of the first eight holes at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club, and added birdies on Nos. 12 and 14. \nMichelle Wie was a stroke back along with defending champion Shanshan Feng, Yani Tseng and Chella Choi. Finally over hip and ankle injuries, Wie had eight birdies and three bogeys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:34.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
