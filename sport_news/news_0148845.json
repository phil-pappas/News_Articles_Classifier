Bergner Jr. The Daily Courier FLAGSTAFF - Junior tailback Christian Setter had over 150 yards rushing, scored a career-high five first-half touchdowns and the Prescott football team won its fourth-straight contest with a 61-12 road victory over Coconino on Friday night, Oct. 2.To begin the game, Setter capped off a 60-yard drive by the Badgers with a touchdown to make it 7-0, then scored again with 56 seconds remaining in the first quarter to make it 14-6.The lone first-half score for Coconino came when senior quarterback Cristo Tabares hit Jacob Hughes in stride on a 33-yard touchdown pass.Despite that, Prescott head coach Cody Collett said his team had a good approach in their Division III, Section VIII opener.\"Our tempo was good. Our approach was good ... and after that long drive in the first quarter by Coconino, I thought we responded well,\" Collett said.And respond well they did, Setter style.With 9:55 to play in the second quarter, Setter scored his third rushing touchdown of the night on a 25-yard run to make it 21-6 Badgers, then scored again to make it 28-6 with just under 8 minutes to play in the half.After the Prescott [5-1 Overall] defense stopped the Panthers on the ensuing drive, Setter took the punt and returned it 62 yards for the score, making it a 35-6 affair. \"[Setter] had a great game. He got some great blocking and had a nice punt return,\" Collett said.The junior fell one touchdown shy of tying the school single-game record of six set by Brady Mengarelli in 2012 against Cactus Shadows. Setter is averaging over 120 yards per game on the ground and now has 15 TDs this season.In the second half, Prescott continued its dominance. Up 41-6, sophomore quarterback Ryan Greene scored on a 27-yard touchdown run.After Coconino senior running back Weston Smith scored with 10:49 to play in the game to make it 54-12, Prescott junior defensive lineman Edgar Aguilera had the play of the night, forcing a fumble on a quarterback pitch and returning it 85 yards for the score.\"He's actually our fastest lineman so when we were on the sideline and he got the ball I said, 'Oh, he's gone,'\" Collett said.Coconino [3-4 Overall] came into Friday night's contest ranked No. 39 in the AIA Power Point Poll for Division III. The Badgers stood at No. 27, but after the win over the Panthers, that is surely to change.Next up, Prescott will host No. 37-ranked Apache Junction on Friday, Oct. 9.
