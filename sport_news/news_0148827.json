(AP) - The Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is honoring a 19th century championship baseball team from Louisville. \nThe museum says it plans to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the 1890 American Association Champion Louisville Colonels with a special exhibit running from Saturday through Nov. 1. \nThe special exhibit will be on display in the museum’s lobby area. Museum officials say it will include more than a dozen rare photographs of Louisville Colonels players, as well as team photographs. A photo of the 1890 team will be included. \nInside the museum, guests can view a bat and ball used by Hall of Famer Honus Wagner, as well as scorebooks from the Colonels teams of the 19th century. Officials say those pieces have not been on display before in Louisville. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:30:41.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
