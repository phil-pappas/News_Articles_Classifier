It was Sacramento.\nBut through a bizarre series of events, Mbah a Moute didn’t get the team he wanted, instead finding himself starting the season without a clear path for minutes on the Clippers, an NBA title contender.\n“Things usually work out one way or another and usually not how you expect it,” he said before the Clippers’ practice Sunday. “I’m just glad for the opportunity to be on this team. This team has a chance to be something special, and to be a part of it would be special. I’m glad it worked out for me.”\nMbah a Moute secured the Clippers’ final available roster spot, beating out veteran forward Chuck Hayes.\nClippers head coach and president of basketball operations Doc Rivers didn’t pull Mbah a Moute to the side to let him know he made the team. Rivers said nothing, and in this case, the silence was the good news.\n“They didn’t tell me I was gone … so I just show up for work,” Mbah a Moute said with a grin. “They didn’t tell me I can’t be here anymore, so I’m here.”\nRivers said the decision came down to Mbah a Moute’s presence on one end of the floor.\n“I just think he can defend,” Rivers said. “He’s one of those guys that can be a great team defender.”\nMbah a Moute’s deal becomes guaranteed for the entire season Jan.10.\nHe ended up with the Clippers after the Kings voided Mbah a Moute’s deal with the team, claiming he failed his physical because of a shoulder injury.\n“I mean, I’ve been healthy,” he said. “It’s never been a limitation for me. You have to go ask the people at Sacramento.”\nHowever, Mbah a Moute and the players union filed a grievance against the Kings, and following arbitration in September, the two sides are negotiating.\n“There’s a reason I picked Sacramento,” Mbah a Moute said. “I felt like it was going to be a good situation for me. I’m not glad it happened, but in life, you can’t control everything that happens. You can control what you can do. I’m glad I fell here, and I’m excited about this team and the season to come.”\nPaul supports Popovich hire \nUSA Basketball announced this past weekend that San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich would coach the national team after Mike Krzyzewski steps down following the 2016 Olympics.\nChris Paul, a two-time Olympian, supported the hire.\n“Pop is amazing. I was surprised, obviously, because that’s a big commitment. But I think it’s huge for USA basketball,” Paul said. “I couldn’t imagine replacing Coach K with anybody other than somebody like Coach Popovich.”\nPaul said it’s important for Team USA to have a strong figure coaching the team.\n“I think it gives it a lot of credibility,” he said. “It shows you’re playing for a coach who’s going to teach you and try to make you better.”\nRivers mourns Saunders’ death \nThe NBA community reacted with strong emotion to news of Minnesota coach Flip Saunders’ death Sunday at the age of 60.\n“This is a very sad day and my heart, my prayers and condolences go out to the entire Saunders family,” Rivers said in a statement. “Flip was more than just a friend; he was a confidant and a mentor. The basketball world lost a ‘coaches’ coach today, and I lost a great friend.”\nNotes \nJamal Crawford practiced while wearing a sleeve over his right arm Sunday. Crawford missed the preseason finale with a triceps injury. … Rivers said the team was lucky to make it through the preseason without a major injury. “It’s all luck,” he said. “Anybody who tells you they can prevent injuries are not telling the truth. How can you prevent a guy from landing on someone’s foot? It’s a silly thing. Obviously, as the season goes on, rest over play, maybe that. But an injury is all about being in the wrong place at the right time.”\n\nContact the writer: dwoike@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:11:58.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
