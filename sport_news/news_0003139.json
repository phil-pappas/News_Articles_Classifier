By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMORRIS – Any time teams from Morris and Minooka play each other in anything, it’s a fun time. That will happen when schools are separated by only 13 miles.

Morris won the day, 3-2, as both teams tuned up for their respective conference meets over the weekend. Morris will play in the Northern Illinois Big 12 meet in Rochelle, while Minooka will take part in the Southwest Prairie Conference meet at Oswego East. \nMorris (9-9) won both singles matches in the night, with Meghan Davy defeating Yazmine Thomas, 6-1, 6-2, and Emma Dingbaum defeating Morgan Gierman, 6-3, 6-3. In doubles, Minooka emerged victorious at No. 2 as Grace Thelo and Gabrielle Hajduk beat Emily Lamaze and Pauli Stevens, 6-0, 6-2, and at No. 3 with Madison Kaufman and Paige Morris downing Abbi Borgstrom and Vanessa Buenrostro, 6-0, 6-0. \nThe deciding match was at first doubles, and it was also the final match to be decided. The Morris team of Autumn See and Melissa Larsen beat Emma Van Drie and Sarah Boeringa, 6-1, 4-6, 10-6. \n“This was a nice match for us,” Morris coach Samantha Shannon said. “I would much rather have a match the day before the conference meet. It keeps everybody’s energy up. Especially with a win, we can go into the conference meet on a high note and with a positive attitude and hope we can do some damage there. \n“Our first doubles team, Autumn See and Melissa Larsen, had a good match. They played a good first set and then played well in the tiebreaker. Emma Dingbaum had been out with an ankle injury for a couple of matches, so it was nice to see her come back and get a win. We have a busy couple of weeks coming up with conference and sectionals. We go to Ottawa for the sectional, so we are hoping to have the opportunity to take some more girls back to the state meet.” \nMinooka coach Jessica Carter was also glad to see her Indians (8-3) have the tuneup match with the difficult Southwest Prairie Conference meet coming up, then a sectional in Joliet. \n“It was a decent match for us,” Carter said. “Our first doubles team had some trouble with their volleys today. It was just one of those days. Grace and Gabby at No. 2 doubles, this whole season has been a breeze for them. They are the top seed at the conference meet and we are looking for some big things for them this year and in the future since they are both sophomores. \n“This is our only match this week, so it was nice to get out. Practice can get pretty mundane hitting against the same girls all the time. It’s nice to see someone different. Now, we have a conference meet and a tough sectional to get ready for.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:19:28.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
