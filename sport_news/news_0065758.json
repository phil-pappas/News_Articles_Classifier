BolinArkansas News Bureau • ebolin@arkansasnews.com \nFAYETTEVILLE — The saga surrounding Arkansas, Alabama, ESPN, the SEC and hiring practices may finally be at a close. \nA man holding a parabolic microphone at Saturday’s Arkansas-Alabama game used a portable video camera attached to the microphone to inauspiciously record happenings on the Razorbacks sideline. ESPN, which televised the game but did not hire the man directly, said in a statement Friday the worker was in violation of company policy for his actions. \n“After a thorough investigation, we determined the conduct of the individual … during the Arkansas-Alabama game was unacceptable and in violation of ESPN policy and our rights holder agreements. He has been contacted by our legal department to surrender all footage he improperly obtained and remove any and all posts containing it.” \nNeither ESPN or Alabama have identified the man by name. \nThe release of the video on Twitter late Sunday night sparked a near week-long investigation and theorizing. It shows Arkansas coach Bret Bielema step in front of Alabama offensive lineman Cam Robinson after Robinson and a few Arkansas players began to get into a heated exchange. Bielema extended his arm to hold Robinson back and the offensive lineman made a violent gesture Bielema’s direction. Bielema stumbled backward, a nearby official threw a penalty flag and the coach celebrated. \nClaims ranged from suggestions Bielema should be punished for his actions touching an Alabama player, punished for his “flopping” - or making the contact out to be worse than perceived – or his dance on the sideline immediately after the flag. SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey released a statement earlier in the week saying Bielema’s actions were not ideal, but not worthy of any sort of punishment, either. \n“I reminded (Bielema) of the need for head coaches to resolve with their own players issues that may arise, which was his intent,” Sankey’s statement read in part. \nThere were also suggestions the video was part of a conspiracy by some unknown entity to spy on Arkansas goings-on on the sideline. A separate video from the sideline one taken by a GoPro camera, shows a different sideline television broadcast worker signal from behind the Arkansas bench toward the opposite side of the field, or the side of the field where Alabama was benched. A spokesperson for ESPN said that worker’s duties were not improper. \nBielema publicly discussed the video during his media availability Tuesday and Arkansas athletic director Jeff Long released a statement on the course of events Friday. His words likely bring the matter to an end. \n“After conducting a thorough investigation, ESPN acted to address the matter while also revising protocols for future broadcasts,” Long said in the statement. “We believe appropriate steps have been taken and consider the matter resolved.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:05:12.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
