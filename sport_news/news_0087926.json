According to teammate and junior linebacker Jeffrey Rosenstock, Smith typically has only one emotion whether during a game or at practice.\n\"I've been playing football with him forever. It's kind of crazy how happy he always is,\" Rosenstock said. \"He makes it so much fun to play football with him.\"\n\"Andrew competes hard every play and cares a lot,\" Vernon Hills coach Bill Bellecomo said. \"He's everything you'd want in a middle linebacker.\"\nSmith, Vernon Hills' leading tackler this year, accounted for 16 stops against Wauconda, including two quarterback sacks and a quarterback hurry on fourth down. But it's Smith's leadership that stands out, according to Bellecomo.\nCommenting on the Cougars limiting Wauconda to just 54 yards of offense in the second half, Bellecomo said, \"Andrew was very adamant with the team during halftime. They really feed off of him and the defense came out the second half and played well. He always gets guys up and ready to play.\"\nVernon Hills vs Wauconda Joe Shuman / Pioneer Press Vernon Hills' Andrew Smith (left) gets up after bringing down a Wauconda player on Oct. 2.

(Joe Shuman / Pioneer Press) With the defense remaining steadfast, Vernon Hills had a chance to pull the victory out, driving from its own 6-yard line to the Wauconda 13 with 35 seconds left. But a deflected pass was intercepted and returned 89 yards for a touchdown by linebacker Jeremy Hollander.\nCougars senior quarterback Connor McNamara was 23-for-41 for 191 yards and two interceptions. His favorite target was junior wingback Kyle Hull, who had nine receptions for 69 yards. Defensively, junior linebacker Trey Hommer had a fumble recovery, senior defensive back Andres Salazar recorded an interception, and Rosenstock blocked an extra point.\nAfter each one of those big defensive stops, Smith could be seen exhorting his teammates to continue with an abundance of enthusiasm.\nSmith doesn't see much time off the field, as he plays offensive guard. But it's on defense where Smith is most noticeable.\n\"It's his emotion. His effort,\" senior linebacker Jeffrey Echeverria said. \"He just never gives up.\"\nThat was evident midway through the fourth quarter. On a key third-and-2 from midfield, Smith stopped the ball carrier for a 1-yard gain to force a punt. But Smith's ankle was rolled up on during the play, and he had to be helped off the field. The next time Wauconda got the ball, Smith was right back on the field.\n\"I had to get back out there no matter what,\" Smith said. \"It still hurts, but the loss hurts a lot more.\"\nMark Perlman is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.\nTwitter: @markdavidperlma\n Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f5f91/turbine/ct-vhr-vernon-hills-wauconda-football-tl-1002-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f5f90/turbine/ct-ctlfl-ct-vhr-fbl-verno-tl-1002-p2-jpg-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-03T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:39:45.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
