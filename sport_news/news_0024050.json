(AP) â€” \nShabazz Napier scored 11 of his 15 points in overtime against his former team and the Orlando Magic beat the Miami Heat 95-92 on Tuesday night. HEAT: Josh Richardson led the Heat with 18. Tyler Johnson took a hard fall in the first quarter and sat the second half with a sore lower back. MAGIC: Aaron Gordon, who missed the first four exhibition games recovering from jaw surgery, played 17 minutes, scoring 10 points. He had two highlight-worthy dunks, including one off a bounced alley-oop from rookie Mario Hezonja. RESTING UP: Magic guard Elfrid Payton (sore hamstring) and forward Tobias Harris (sore knee) both sat. In the Heat's first back-to-back of the preseason, coach Erik Spoelstra gave the night off to veterans, with the exception of spot minutes by Chris Andersen and Gerald Green. MIDSEASON FORM: Orlando forward Channing Frye had 12 points and eight rebounds in 18 minutes. UP NEXT: The Heat play Houston on Saturday. Orlando heads to Brazil to play Flamengo on Saturday.
