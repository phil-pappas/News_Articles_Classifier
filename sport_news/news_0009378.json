I mean, you play in Philly, I mean this is the same. Right? I think he was fine. . . . \n\"I know people are still probably up in arms about the whole thing, but I know Chase, he felt horrible about the kid getting hurt. And that's one of the things, I think guys that play the game hard, they feel like they play the game right, they really don't want to - they want to play like that, but they're not looking to hurt anybody. But that being said, I think he handled [the atmosphere] fine.\" \nGiven the date of his appeal hearing, Utley also would be eligible to play the first two games of the NLCS if the Dodgers advance. Three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw started for them Tuesday night opposite the rookie Matz. \n\"The fact that they felt the play was unnecessary and they did what they did [with the suspension] was enough,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said of the news that Utley was available to play the entire series. \"It was enough for us. And now we've moved past it and you've got to get ready to play.\" Rollins back on bench \nAfter making his first start of the series for the Dodgers in Game 3, Jimmy Rollins was back on the bench to begin Game 4. \nMattingly went with 21-year-old phenom Corey Seager over Rollins, who took a backseat to the rookie late in the regular season. \nSeager batted .337 and posted a .986 OPS over 98 regular-season at-bats and came into Tuesday with two hits, including a double, in nine at-bats in the division series. Rollins, who batted a dismal .224 with a .643 OPS in his first season away from the Phillies, entered Tuesday with one hit in six at-bats in the series. \n\"Corey has come in and played really well, for the most part,\" Mattingly said. \"He's gotten the lion's share of the at-bats at the end of the year. Part of it was because Jimmy got hurt there and couldn't really get back into the rhythm, but the other part is Corey kind of came in and just played really, really well. \n\"So we look at Corey [as a player who] hits both sides. He sees spin pretty good. Just tonight we feel like he's the right guy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:29:01.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
