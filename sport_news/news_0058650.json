This weekend may hold several such games for certain SEC coaches. \nFor many Tennessee fans, Butch Jones pulled off what they hope was a pivotal win two weeks ago when the Vols took down Georgia. The win brought Tennessee back to .500 on the season for one, but it also marked a win over one of Tennessee's traditional rivals, something the Vols have struggled to find since their descent into the post-Phillip Fulmer era. \nAlabama remains the white whale for Butch Jones and for any Tennessee coach looking to bring the Vols back to relevance in college football. A loss to Alabama probably isn't the end of the line for Butch Jones as the SEC East still presents plenty of opportunities for the Vols to reach bowl eligibility and show progress this season. A win in Tuscaloosa, however, would make Tennessee's future inarguably bright. \nMeanwhile in Fayetteville, Arkansas fans are looking for something, anything to hang their hats on in year three of the Bret Bielema era. Last year's bowl win over Texas seemed to suggest a promising 2015 for the Hogs but so far Arkansas has been arguably the biggest disappointment of the SEC this season. Bret Bielema has spent the last two and a half years trying to convince the Arkansas fanbase (and the rest of us) that Auburn is a rivalry game for the Razorbacks. In this case, saying it repeatedly seems to have made it the truth. \nAuburn enters this game with plenty of motivation of its own, starting with the head coach. Gus Malzahn's reputation as the up-and-coming genius of college football has taken some black eyes this season as the Tigers have followed up a disappointing back half of the 2014 season with a perplexing start to 2015. Malzahn has spent the week talking up the Tigers' win over Kentucky, hailing it as a potential turning point for the season. But this weekend's showdown with the Razorbacks will tell us whether the Tigers have truly become a different team than the one we saw run out of Baton Rouge by a physical LSU squad. \nWhich third-year coaches come out of this weekend feeling better about their future? Which ones are left scrambling to save their seasons from disaster? I'll be here a little after 10 a.m. Central to discuss with you in the comments section below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:41:04.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
