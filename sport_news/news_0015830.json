(AP) â€” USC athletic director Pat Haden made a brief stop at a hospital after feeling lightheaded just before kickoff of the Trojans' game against Notre Dame. \nSports information director Tim Tessalone said everything checked out OK and Haden headed back to Los Angeles early on a private airplane. Tessalone said Haden dropped to a knee briefly. He spent some time in the locker room before heading to the hospital. \nHaden has been under scrutiny for his hiring of Steve Sarkisian and for allowing Sarkisian to continue to coach after slurring his words and using inappropriate language during an event in August and other struggles by the football team. Haden fired Sarkisian this week. \nNotre Dame won 41-31. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
