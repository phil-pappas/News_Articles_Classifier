Ole Miss linked to NCAA investigation at ULL \nLouisiana-Lafayette’s 78-page response to the allegations said Ole Miss conducted an interview in December 2013 with Saunders and an athlete he had previously been recruiting to Ole Miss and completed an interview with Crager in February 2014. \n“Through the course of those interviews, it became apparent to (Louisiana-Lafayette associate director of athletics for academics and compliance Jessica) Lager that the enforcement staff was testing information that suggested Saunders knew of, or had been involved in, NCAA rules violations of an academic nature while employed at Ole Miss,” the response reads. \nSaunders worked for Ole Miss on three separate occasions: from 1998 to 2002, in 2006 and in 2010. He joined the Louisiana-Lafayette coaching staff in January 2011 after his third stint with the Rebels but was fired in October 2014. \nHe is now an assistant coach at Pearl River Community College. Saunders declined a request for comment through the school’s sports information department. \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
