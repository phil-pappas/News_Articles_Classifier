Blakely Street and N.E. 45th Place about 4:30 p.m. on September 29 when she passed the suspect,” police spokesman Jonah Spangenthal-Lee said in a statement. “He reportedly smirked at the woman as he exposed himself to her. The woman rode on – she told officers she was unable to reach her mace – at the time and reported the incident the following day.”\nAnother woman called the night of the 29th after she encountered a man in same area of the Burke Gilman Trail, leaning against a railing with his shorts around his knees, police said.\n“Officers searched the trail on the night of the incident, but were unable to find the suspect,” Spangenthal-Lee said. “Detectives are investigating the case and have developed a sketch of the suspect, who was described as a white male, around 40 years old, 5’9, with a medium to heavy build, dark brown hair, balding, wearing a dark shirt, khaki shorts and green underwear.”\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Seattle Police Special Assault Unit at (206) 684-5575.", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:35:32.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
