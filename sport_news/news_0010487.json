That’s unfortunate, because these two seats have been springboards for future mayors (Floyd Adams Jr. and Edna Jackson). Since they aren’t tied to a specific district, the at-large aldermen are free to focus on the big picture.\nAt the same time, at-large aldermen are perfectly positioned to tell the mayor and the rest of City Council unpopular things they don’t like to hear, but need to hear — like they’ve been spending an additional $12,000 a month on outside legal help for no documented reason. But the role of being a messenger who delivers unwelcome news can be frustrating — especially when it has no effect. That’s a big reason the incumbent at-large alderman in Post 2, Tom Bordeaux, decided to call it quits after one four-year term, a loss for City Council.\nGiven this unique arrangement, voters should be encouraged to elect candidates who are broad-minded, big-picture people to these posts.\nWith that in mind, here are our recommendations:\nCarol Bell\nMs. Bell is one of the brightest lights on City Council and best hopes for better government. She knows the city and its Byzantine politics (she has lived here 40 years), she’s smart (she has a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and a master’s in public administration) and she knows how city government is supposed to work (She completed post-graduate studies at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and she retired from the city of Savannah after 38 years of service, leaving as the director of the city’s Central Services). Her departure from City Hall was forced by former City Manager Rochelle Small-Toney, which is a badge of honor for Ms. Bell, who refused to be bullied and become one of her former boss’s stooges. Indeed, Ms. Bell stood by her guns when the mayor and council finally booted Ms. Small-Toney from City Hall, a politically unpopular move in some parts of the African-American community. Ms. Bell, however, was rightly looking out for the entire city. She paid a political price, as she became the target of a recall threat that went nowhere.\nMs. Bell took 64 percent of the vote when she won this at-large race four years ago. In this election, she faces Linda Wilder-Bryan, who works as an environmental health and safety coordinator. Ms. Wilder-Bryan has failed to make the case that Ms. Bell should go. Ms. Bell isn’t afraid to be critical of council. She also thinks the city should join forces with social service agencies such as the United Way or Youth Futures and work under the leadership of one of the agencies in developing a community-wide plan to address poverty, which in addition to harnessing the city’s Step-Up anti-poverty initiative, is a fine idea that might get the ball rolling. Ms. Bell speaks for many residents inside and outside the city when she said she believes the city would benefit from strategic improvements in City Hall leadership. She is task-and-goal oriented, which made her the perfect choice to co-chair the Mayor’s Business Roundtable, which resulted in improvements in the city’s permitting system and the online payment of fees which made Savannah a more business-friendly city, increasing from No. 145 to No. 78 on the prestigious Forbes list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.\nShe’s also not afraid of creating new opportunities. She has been one voice speaking up for a responsible way to permit food trucks without crippling brick-and-mortal businesses.\nCarol Bell also deserves credit for trying to make City Council and those who sit on it more accessible to the public. In 2013, she began organizing events called “Ask an Alderman,” in each of the city’s six districts. All aldermen should be as interested as she is in engaging with citizens. Then maybe the entire council might be more responsive in non-election years. We endorse her candidacy and encourage voters to support her when they go to the polls Nov. 3.\nBrian Foster\nThe crowded race for this seat features one of the strongest fields on the Nov. 3 ballot. In addition to retired banker and longtime civic advocate Brian Foster, attorney Joseph Steffen Jr. and downtown business manager Travis Coles add experience and depth to the field.\nOur recommendation is Brian Foster, who has made restoring public safety and reprioritizing the city’s budget two of his top items. Mr. Foster has a proven record for economic development and knows the community’s strengths and weaknesses in attracting business investments that create good-paying jobs.\nAs chairman of the board of the Savannah Technical College Foundation, he helped lead the campaign to raise $10 million for job training. He also has served as chairman of the Savannah Economic Development Authority so he knows what local governments must do to attract new employers.\nAs the retired president and CEO of First Chatham Bank, he can be counted on to take a sharp pencil to the city’s budget and ask relevant questions, like why did the city spend less on police protection last year than it did in 2008, despite millions of new visitors to the city since that time. In fact, he has pointed out, spending for police was $2.7 million less last year than in 2012. In light of today’s crime problems, that was terrible budgeting. He’s just the person to cut waste so more money can be used to beef up and fully staff the police department with the optimum number of officers to protect the actual number of people who are in the city at any given time. He also believes he can find the money to buy the police cars, equipment and cameras the city needs to boost public safety.\nAnd the problem with vacancies goes beyond police and includes the fire department and other agencies. Mr. Foster is right to want to shine a spotlight on the city’s human resources department to find out what’s wrong and how this vacancy problem can be fixed.\nBecause of his many connections in the business and civic communities, Mr. Foster is uniquely positioned to be a catalyst to help solve some of the city’s intractable problems, like poverty reduction and steering young people in healthy, positive directions. Among those who are backing Mr. Foster’s candidacy is Mr. Bordeaux. We enthusiastically concur.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14805789.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14805787.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14805789.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14805787.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-24T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:17:00.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
