One hot streak. One bad spell. And it's over quickly.\nSo there's a lot to fear for teams. A lot to believe can go wrong.\nAnd when the Dodgers play the Mets in the National League Division Series , they will have a few players to fear. The Mets have talent in many places. It makes for a fearsome bunch to face over a week.\nMETS 2015 NLDS PREVIEW : How Mets overcame headaches and torn UCLs to keep their pitching in line for the NLDS We've identified the five players the Dodgers should fear most this week. If we missed one, let us know. Sure, L.A. has Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, but the Mets have some guys to watch too.\n\"I know who we're facing but – I don't want to say anything – they're facing some couple pretty good guys too,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said.\nMeanwhile, we know Yoenis Cespedes fears no one and nothing. Not Kershaw. Not Greinke. Not the Dodgers. Not death.\n\"I am 100 percent ready to start this battle,\" he said through an interpreter this week.\nHe added: \"They're pitchers just like anyone else. They're going to throw the same pitches. I think the most important thing is to have fun.\"\nThis is going to be fun. The best playoff series of the first round. Just look at all that talent.\nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @Mike_Vorkunov .
