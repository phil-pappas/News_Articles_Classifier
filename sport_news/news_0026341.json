Shower or two. Sport Cairns rider dominates first two stages of gruelling nine-day event by: Crocodile Trophy stage 1 at the Smithfield trails. Womens stage winner Sarah White. PICTURE: STEWART McLEAN Source: News Limited Crocodile Trophy 2015: Stage 1 highlights \nSARAH White’s quest to ­secure a UCI World Cup berth has been boosted by consecutive wins in the first two stages of the Crocodile Trophy, positioning her closer to a maiden appearance at the premier mountain bike event next April in Cairns. \nThe 35-year-old Cairns product, part of the strong ­Astute Financial Racing team, only took up mountain biking 12 months ago. The riders start stage 1 of the Croc Trophy with stage winner Nicholas Pettina, No 7, of Italy leading from the start. PICTURE: STEWART McLEAN Source: News Limited \nThe former ultra-distance marathon runner claimed yesterday’s elite women’s stage two 74km leg from Cairns to Lake Tinaroo ahead of highly rated German rival Regina Genser. \nShe crossed the line in three hours and 42 minutes but more importantly has established an overall lead of 25 minutes over her European rival, a buffer that could well prove unattainable over the next seven stages. \n“I’m really pleased to have started the Trophy well,” White said. \n“I just want to keep riding well and we’ll see what happens as the race progresses.” \nWhite’s win followed victory in Saturday’s opening stage, which saw her take full advantage of competing on her home track at Smithfield to finish the lap race in one hour and 50 minutes. Crocodile Trophy 2015: Stage 2 highlights \nToday’s stage three is at Atherton’s mountain bike park, and will see riders complete two loops of a 27km course. \nWhite is using the nine-day, nine-stage iconic mountain bike stage race to accumulate points in her bid to qualify for the World Cup to be held in seven months’ time. \nIn the men’s, defending champion and former North Queensland resident Greg Saw needs a big third stage, as a seventh and an eighth during the first two legs have him placed down in the ­standings. \nAustralian national marathon champion Brendan Johnston started well, a third on top of yesterday’s fifth, placing him close to the top three. \nTwo-time Crocodile trophy winner Urs Huber heads the overall men’s standings, a second and a first giving him the current lead ahead of Denmark’s Soren Nissen and stage one winner Nicholas Pettina. Stage winner Nicholas Pettina, No 7, of Italy leading from the start with 3rd place Brendan Johnston chasing.
