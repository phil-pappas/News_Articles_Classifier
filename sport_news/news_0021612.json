But the Nittany Lions didn't have the finishing punch they needed, and Ohio State's dazzling playmakers accounted for four of its touchdowns in a 38-10 Big Ten victory before a crowd of 108,423 at Ohio Stadium. \nBarkley and Akeel Lynch both returned from injuries suffered in the game against San Diego State on Sept. 26. Lynch started, but Barkley received most of the carries on the night. His long gain was 56 yards on the first play of the fourth quarter. \nHowever, as was the case most of the night, Penn State couldn't punch it in. Trailing by 24-10, the Nittany Lions had the ball on the Ohio State 21 after Barkley's run but eventually turned the ball over on downs. Christian Hackenberg was sacked on the fourth-down play, one of his five on the game. More coverage SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise The Lions (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten), who had a five-game winning streak snapped, scored their only points on Joey Julius' 33-yard field goal and Hackenberg's 8-yard pass to DaeSean Hamilton.\nThe Buckeyes (7-0, 3-0) took control of the game with three touchdowns in the second quarter, two by quarterback J.T. Barrett on runs of 5 and 13 yards, and one on Ezekiel Elliott's 10-yard run. \nElliott finished with 153 yards on 27 carries, while Barrett had 102 on 11. \nTrailing by 21-3 at the half, Penn State took the second-half kickoff and needed only three plays to go 78 yards. Hackenberg threw a deep pass on the first play to Chris Godwin, and the big sophomore wide receiver dragged defender Eli Apple 18 yards after the catch to the Ohio State 22, ending a season-high 56-yard completion. \nAfter Barkley ran for 14, Hackenberg hit Hamilton in the flat, and the sophomore tight-roped the sideline, leaped, and touched the football on the pylon for the touchdown. \nOhio State increased its lead to 24-10 early in the fourth quarter on a 39-yard field goal by Jack Willoughby but Penn State came right back, with Barkley going 56 yards on the first play of the next drive. But the surge ended when Hackenberg was sacked on fourth down at the Ohio State 15. \nAfter a fine opening series by their defense, the Nittany Lions started their initial drive of the game at their 23. Lynch surged for 11 yards on the first play, and Hackenberg hit Godwin with a midrange pass that the receiver turned into a 45-yard gain after breaking a tackle attempt. \nGodwin's catch gave Penn State a first down at the Buckeyes 21. The drive stalled there, and Julius kicked a 33-yard field goal to put the Lions on the board first. \nPenn State threatened again later in the opening quarter, but two mistakes were costly. On second and 1 from the Ohio State 44, Hackenberg fired a pass to tight end Mike Gesicki at the 25, but the sophomore dropped it, the latest of several drops he's had this season. \nOn the next play, Barkley took a handoff, sprinted through a big hole at right tackle, and went into the end zone for an apparent 44-yard scoring run, but guard Brian Gaia was flagged for holding. \nAfter gaining just 57 yards in the first quarter, Ohio State started to flex its offensive muscle in the second quarter, which began with the entry of Barrett at quarterback for the first play. Barrett ran 15 yards to a first and goal at the 10, and two plays later he carried it in over the left side from 5 yards out for a 7-3 lead. \nThe touchdown bolstered the confidence of the Buckeyes offense, and the unit utilized its playmakers to its advantage. Ohio State scored touchdowns on its next two possessions to take a 21-3 lead at the half with a mix of Elliott, Jones, Barrett, and Braxton Miller. \nA shanked punt by Penn State's Chris Gulla enabled the Buckeyes to begin their second TD drive of the quarter at the Nittany Lions 45. Miller, the H-back, ran for eight and 12 yards on back-to-back plays to get Ohio State to the 10, from where Elliott scored on a sweep to the right, breaking Marcus Allen's tackle to get in. \nPenn State failed on a fourth-down try at the Ohio State 31 where Hackenberg was sacked for a 3-yard loss and came up limping, although he didn't miss any playing time. \nThe Buckeyes took over and marched 66 yards in six plays, with Jones' 17-yard pass to Miller and a 15-yard run by Elliott setting them up at the Penn State 16. Two plays later, Barrett ran through a huge hole and had himself a 13-yard touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:05:16.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
