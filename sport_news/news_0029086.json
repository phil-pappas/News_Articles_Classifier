Bryant, of course, won six national championships during his legendary career with the Crimson Tide. Stallings, who was one of the famous \"Junction Boys\" for Bryant at Texas A&M, ended a 13-year title drought when he guided Alabama to a 1992 championship. \nWithout Texas A&M, neither might have happened. \nYet, No. 10 Alabama and No. 9 Texas A&M are still in the awkward stages of a budding rivalry. There's history between the two schools, but neither has an intense dislike for the other. The Aggies are still one of the new kids in town and haven't developed the fierce rivalries they had with Texas and others in the Big 12. There have been a few big games since Texas A&M joined the SEC in 2012 — especially in the Johnny Manziel years — but nothing to truly define the rivalry. \nThat changes this Saturday. \nIt's not hard to see why a game between two top 10 ranked SEC West teams is a big deal. Alabama arrives in College Station already possessing a loss and needing to go perfect the rest of the year if it wants to go back to Atlanta for the SEC Championship Game, and more importantly, still be in the running for the College Football Playoff. \nIt faces a hurry-up, no huddle offense that it has traditionally struggled against . Of Alabama's last five SEC losses, four have come to hurry-up, no huddle teams. Saturday is a chance for Nick Saban and defensive coordinator Kirby Smart, a hot name for the South Carolina opening, to prove whether they've evolved enough to stop a potent Texas A&M offense. \nIf the Crimson Tide can't stop Christian Kirk and Co. and win its third consecutive game against the Aggies, its season dreams would be doomed. The Alabama dynasty is over talk would crank up again and Alabama would be that much further away from its last time atop the college football world. \nThink Alabama fans might have stronger feelings about Texas A&M if that happens? \nFor Texas A&M, it's a chance to avenge a brutal 59-0 beatdown last season and earn legitimacy. Texas A&M is the higher ranked of the two teams, but still enters the home game an underdog. \nThe Aggies have been flashy and fun under Kevin Sumlin, but have yet to truly compete for an SEC championship. It started off hot last year before Texas A&M lost five of its last six SEC games, prompting A&M to go out and spend the big bucks to steal defensive coordinator John Chavis away from LSU . No one doubts Texas A&M is talented, but there are plenty that question whether it's for real. \nSaturday gives Sumlin's program its best chance to knock out a major competitor in its pursuit of an SEC West divisional title. With a win, Texas A&M could make an argument to be the top-ranked team in the country — it'll be at least top five — and will be in good shape to make a playoff if it can keep the momentum rolling. \nWhatever happens at Kyle Field, the most important chapter yet of this emerging rivalry will be written.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:11:53.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
