BolinARKANSAS NEWS BUREAU \nFAYETTEVILLE — Despite suggestions all week before the Arkansas-Alabama game otherwise, the Razorbacks were overwhelmed by Alabama. \nThe Crimson Tide won their ninth straight game over Arkansas, 27-14, at Bryant-Denny Stadium on Saturday. The Razorbacks, with their top-30 passing and top-30 rushing offense, managed a paltry 220 yards between both the pass and rush. Fifty-four (54) of those came when the game was already decided — on a lengthy touchdown pass from Brandon Allen to Dominique Reed with 1:37 left. \nThose 220 yards were the fewest from an Arkansas team since 2012. \nThe final score, Allen’s touchdown pass specifically, turned some heads in Las Vegas, perhaps, where it allowed the Razorbacks to cover the 16 1/2-point spread. It also accounted for Allen’s first second-half touchdown pass of the season. \nBeyond that, it made the score less indicative of the show. \nThe Razorbacks will take this week off before returning to Fayetteville in two weeks to host underachieving Auburn. \nThey said it \n“On the plane over (to Alabama), we talked about we’re at a point now where we can do some things week-in and week-out, but want to start turning some of this respect to wins.” \n— Arkansas coach Bret Bielema following team’s loss to Alabama \n“I know this: we’re better in week six than we were in week one. Six games left to determine what our future is.” \n— Bielema on team’s progression \n“There are certain things that Alabama does that brings them success. I don’t know if it got relayed to Santos. I heard the coaches talk about it. I was clicked over with the transition from offense to defense.” \n— Bielama saying the team anticipated a double-move on Alabama’s go-ahead touchdown, but didn’t get it relayed to secondary \nNumbers game \n10 and 10: Arkansas’ 10 first downs were the fewest the team registered since getting seven in a 52-7 loss to South Carolina in 2013. The team’s 10 punts were almost as many as they had through the first five games (12) and were the most since 2009 when the Razorbacks lost to then-No. 1 Alabama. \n27: Alabama’s point total was the fewest it has scored all season. Twenty-four (24) of those points came in the final 17 minutes. \n1: Allen’s late touchdown pass to Reed was the first second-half touchdown the quarterback has thrown this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:42:03.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
