He's played five entire seasons with 10 INTs or fewer. \n— The only other time he's reached double-digit picks after six games was 1998, his rookie year, when he threw a career-worst (and NFL-high) 28 interceptions. Manning threw 23 INTs in 2001, the only other time he exceeded 20. \n— Entering the 2015 campaign, Manning had averaged 14.6 interceptions per season. Everyone's got an opinion about Peyton Manning amid early struggles \n— Manning's QB rating dipped to 72.5 after Sunday, when he finished 26-for-48 for 290 yards, one touchdown and those three INTs. The only time his passer rating has been worse was that 1998 rookie campaign (71.2). Manning's career average is 96.9, which is third-highest in league history. \n— Accuracy has been yet another issue. Manning is connecting on 61.6% of this throws in 2015 — again his lowest rate since he was a rookie (56.7%). \n— Manning is on pace to throw 19 TD passes. He's never thrown fewer than 26 in a single season. His seven TDs are his fewest through six games since, you guessed it, 1998. He's averaged 33.1 TD strikes in his 16 full seasons. \nOf course, it must also be noted that, at the end of Sunday, Manning and the Broncos are 6-0 (the sixth time Manning has been part of a 6-0 start, two times now with Denver). And really, that's the most important number.
