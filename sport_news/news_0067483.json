Bush throws out ceremonial 1st pitch before Game 3 of ALDS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   5:07   5:07   \nPeople: \nTexas (1310) \nHOUSTON â€” Former President George H.W. Bush, in a wheelchair and wearing a neck brace, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the American League Division Series between the Houston Astros and Kansas City Royals on Sunday. \nThe 91-year-old Bush, recovering after breaking a vertebra in his neck in a summer spill, smiled broadly when the crowd cheered after he was brought onto the field. With wife Barbara by his side, he bounced a short throw from about five feet in front of the plate to Houston's Jed Lowrie, who was set up to catch. \nBush is a longtime Astros fan with a home in Houston, and for years he attended dozens of games a year in seats just behind home plate. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:06:30.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
