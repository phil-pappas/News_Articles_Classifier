India longs to see enduring peace and tranquility in the new-born Himalayan democracy. Nepal is demographically multilingual, multi-ethnic and has a predominant Hindu majority. The constitution declares Nepal an independent, sovereign, secular, democratic republic. An India-based Nepal diplomat, in an ecstatic moment, described the Nepalese constitution as “better drafted than the Indian Constitution”. The remark is reminiscent of the words of Dr Ambedkar that ring through time: “All constitutions in their main provisions must look similar. The only new things, if there be any, in a constitution framed so late in the day, are the variations made to remove the faults and to accommodate it to the needs of the country.” The test of a constitution is whether it accommodates the needs, and fulfils the aspirations of its people. The constitution of Nepal, containing 302 Articles and 9 Schedules, enshrines the principle of parliamentary democracy with certain innovations and novel features, a Himalayan brand of parliamentary democracy. The President is the ceremonial head of the state. The executive power vests with the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The most noteworthy feature of the constitution is (and a cause of upheaval) the provision of a mixed electoral system comprising direct election and proportional representation. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers shall be collectively and individually responsible to the Federal Parliament but must enjoy the majority support in the House of Representatives for their survival. A motion of no-confidence or the “Abiswas ko prastab” cannot be brought against the Prime Minister for the first two years after his appointment, and if the motion of no-confidence fails, another motion cannot be tabled within a year of its failure. The political structure is divided into federal, provincial and local governments. The judicial system is unified with the Supreme Court at the apex, a high court for each state and a district court for each of the districts. The country is divided into seven provinces numbered consecutively. The preamble to the constitution declares Nepal a multi-caste, multilingual, multi-cultural state and resolves to end all forms of discriminations, promote unity in diversity, create an egalitarian society on the basis of the principle of proportional inclusion and participation, and ensure equitable economy, prosperity and social justice. The solemn resolve to establish a multi-party democratic governance system, guarantee civil liberty, fundamental rights, human rights, adult franchise, periodic elections, free press, and an independent and competent judiciary is fortified by explicit constitutional provisions. The national flag, national anthem, coat of arms, national colour, national flower and national animal (cow) are indicated in the constitution. Persons of the same gender and community cannot occupy the post of the President and Vice-President at the same time. The Federal Parliament comprises the House of Representatives and the National Assembly. The House of Representatives shall consist of 275 members, of which 165 shall be elected through the “first-past-the-post-electoral system” comprising the whole of Nepal, divided into 165 electoral constituencies based on geography and population. As many as 110 members shall be elected through proportional representation, under which the electorates vote for the parties treating the whole of Nepal as a single electoral constituency. The National Assembly, representing the provinces, shall consist of 59, including three nominated, members. The legislative power is divided between the Federal Parliament, Provincial Legislatures and local governments. The constitution provides for the setting up of various commissions for the protection of human rights and for dealing with issues relating to fiscal and natural resources, Dalits, women, language and social inclusion. There are also provisions regarding the constitution, registration and operation of political parties, with the explicit objective of promoting competitive party politics. The Madeshis and the Tharu, who populate the Tarai and constitute nearly 40 per cent of Nepal’s population, are deeply incensed with the manner the boundaries of the seven provinces are proposed to be drawn. The dilution of the element of proportional representation from 58 per cent, as contemplated in the interim constitution of 2007, to 45 per cent, has fuelled further resentment among low-caste groups and the marginalised sections. Women’s rights activists are critical of the provision dealing with citizenship being backward and discriminatory against women. They lament that Nepal has not come out of the strong tentacles of a patriarchal society. There is a widespread seething discontent among the Janajatis (hill tribes), Tharus (plains tribes in Tarai), Dalits and Madeshis (majority electorate) that they would be marginalised politically by the new constitution scripted by the ruling clique of high-caste hill elites. They are piqued that the ruling Brahmin-Kshatria (Bahun-Chettri) coalition, comprising less than 30 per cent of the population, will continue to have a dominant control over the state apparatus, as the leadership of the major political parties — NC, CPN (UML) and UCPN-Maoist — belongs to the same minority upper caste clique. Unfortunately, the unrest in the Tarai region is being viewed by vested political interest in Nepal, as though India has played a spoiler. Perhaps democratic politics finds similar ruse — “blame the neighbour for internal failures”. The relations between India and Nepal go to a hoary past, fused together as they are by strong civilisational ties, the legend of the Buddha and the propinquity of blood and kinship. This cannot be allowed to wilt, wither and assume unfriendly overtones. Our close cultural ties and friendship cannot be held hostage by parochial politics. The erroneous perception of “big brother” and the hypothetical view that India is trying to “micromanage their polity” must be dispelled. Nepal and India are civilisational twins. Even the Himalayas did not divide them. The people of Nepal have come out of the throes of monarchy and the Maoists after a long and bloody struggle. Let democracy thrive and prosper in Nepal and let their democratic politics mature and find amicable solutions to redress the legitimate urges and aspirations of all sections of the people, within their own flexible constitutional framework, and resolve the acrimony over geography vs demography in the interest of a stable, peaceful and prosperous Nepal. — The writer is the Additional Secretary, Lok Sabha.
