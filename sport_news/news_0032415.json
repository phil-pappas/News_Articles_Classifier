There were 18 combined misses with field goals (14 misses) and extra-point attempts (four misses). It's the second most misses in a week since the 2010 season, according to NFL.com . This is the same week where former Tulane standout Cairo Santos drained seven field goals for Kansas City.\nIt's apparent moving the extra-point try to 33 yards has played a role in the mini-kicker crisis across the league. The shift has undoubtedly placed more of a premium on kickers.\nWhat's also become more apparent is there's an elite class of kickers, and then there's the rest. If your team doesn't employ Justin Tucker, Stephen Gostkowski, Steven Hauschka, Matt Bryant or Robbie Gould, you're holding your breathe on every kick -- field goal or extra point.\nYou're also inviting the kicker tour to your town after a couple of misses from your current kicker.\nThe strong comments by Sean Payton about the kicker job should surprise no one. Anyone ever kicking for the New Orleans Saints not named Morten Andersen or John Carney should rent and not buy. And make sure your lease is month to month.\nZach Hocker isn't the first Saints kicker with a tenuous job status. He probably won't be the last. That's what happens when you miss a 30-yard field goal that could have cost the Saints a game.\n\"Obviously, when you get into a position like we did the other night we have to be able to make that type of field goal, and if not, then someone else will have a chance to,\" Payton said.\nHocker said all the right things when asked about his job Thursday. He was on the other side of the fence all last year making the rounds from city to city to try out for teams possibly on the market for kickers.\nHocker added he's not walking on eggshells because if he does \"it's over.\" If he misses any more easy kicks in the next game or two, it could be over in a hurry.\nAnnually, this seems like a Saints problem. But this isn't simply a Saints issue any more this year.", "external_links": ["http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000550298/article/week-4-kicking-woes-might-not-be-as-bad-as-they-seem"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:56:39.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
