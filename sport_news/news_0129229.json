BolinArkansas News Bureau - ebolin@arkansasnews.com \nFAYETTEVILLE – For the first time in almost 11 months Arkansas coach Bret Bielema was able to address the media during his typical Monday availability coming off a win. \nThe weekend’s victory over Tennessee clearly re-energized the coach. Bielema never carries a hangdog look, but three straight losses was taking its toll. His answers were becoming shorter and shorter each following Monday. More terse. Less joyful. \nThat changed yesterday. Instead of another stay-the-course line, Bielema wondered aloud how things could be if the Razorbacks just won one of the three previous losses – the Texas A&M game. \n“If we’d won that game and won this game, we’d be sitting at the top of the – it’s crazy to think about what it is,” Bielema said. “That’s why every week in this league is survival of the fittest.” \nNot everything exited the weekend was positive. More is needed from wide receivers not named Drew Morgan and another season-ending injury, at least the third so far, is going to have be overcome. \nStrongside linebacker Josh Williams broke his leg early in the third quarter of the Tennessee game. Bielema thought the play was an illegal low block. Williams never saw it coming, the coach said. Having played in every game up until this point, Bielema said, Williams won’t qualify for a medical hardship and he will have one final season, 2016, remaining as a senior. Williams underwent surgery Sunday afternoon and doctors put a rod in his leg. Recovery time is four months. \nAs for the perimeter, Morgan was sharp again. The Greenwood native had his second straight 100-yard receiving game. The rest of the wide-receiving corps caught two passes. Dominique Reed’s was a 33-yard touchdown and Kendrick Edwards caught one for 13 yards. \nReed’s case is especially perplexing to Bielema. Reed is a first-year player in the system, a junior-college transfer whom Bielema called his top priority in the most recent recruiting class. He showed his speed, his biggest weapon, in his touchdown catch-and-run as he zipped past four Tennessee defenders. It was as impressive a play as the Razorbacks have had this year. \nIt’s also not happening with enough regularity. The coaching staff continues to give Reed, Edwards and Jojo Robinson the chances, but little has come. \n“We tried,” Bielema said. “You know you can only – Dominique is a very versatile player. Jojo is the same way. Kendrick, we targeted him early, he fell down. All three of those guys we would like to get more and more involved but they have to be better in practice. They have to be more disciplined about where they are on the routes.” \nNo such worries are coming from the two most vexing areas of the early parts of the season. \nAlex Collins has run for the third-most yards in the SEC, behind only Heisman Trophy contenders Nick Chubb at Georgia and Leonard Fournette at LSU. Collins has run for 150 yards more in three straight games. Only two other players in Arkansas history have done that. His backfield mate, freshman Rawleigh Williams, has the third-most rushing yards for a back-up running back in the conference. \nAnd those yards are coming from a reinvigorated offensive line. The unit badly struggled through the team’s first two games. It was so bad, in fact, offensive line coach Sam Pittman said “we’re trying to figure it out.” A 182-yard effort followed by one of 103 had Arkansas about 70th in the nation in rushing. Games since have been 228, 232 and 275. And still the Razorbacks have allowed quarterback Brandon Allen to be sacked just twice. That’s three fewer than any other team in the league. \nWith one game left – Saturday at Alabama – before a bye week in the direct middle of the season, Bielema is telling his team “just one more.” \n“This will be our sixth straight game and with a bye week coming after it, it kind of allows our kids to see a little bit of the end of the rainbow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:01:31.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
