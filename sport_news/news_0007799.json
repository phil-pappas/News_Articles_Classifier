When the Giants return to Lincoln Financial Field - the site of Cruz's season-ending patellar tear a year ago - the wideout will be inactive, barring a miraculous turn of events, for the sixth straight week as he battles a left calf sprain. \nBut while there is still no timetable for Cruz's return, Coughlin again reiterated he will not be placed on short-term injured reserve with a designation to return, meaning Cruz will continue to occupy a spot on the active roster as he rehabs. \n\"This was thoroughly discussed when he injured himself the last time,\" Coughlin said. \"The doctors battled for him being back before the time would be up on the IR.\" \nPLUS : Giants lose CB Prince Amukamara for 2-4 weeks with torn pec Giants coach Tom Coughlin uncharacteristically offers praise to NJ Advance Media reporter Jordan Raanan After years of questions, NJ Advance Media reporter Jordan Raanan finally gets New York Giants head coach Tom Coughlin to say, “You’re right. It’s rare. Very rare.” (Video by John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nIf a player is placed on IR with a designation to return, he must sit out six weeks before resuming practice, and eight weeks before playing in a game. Cruz was initially set to play in the Giants' fourth game of the season against the Bills, before suffering a setback in his first day at practice . He then received a PRP injection in the calf to try and expedite his second recovery bid. \nIf the Giants had placed him on IR with a designation to return then, he would not have been eligible to play until their Week 12 game against the Redskins in Landover, Md., or Week 13 against the Jets at home, depending on how the dates shook out. \nSo, the Giants must feel Cruz will be back before Thanksgiving. Coughlin said two weeks ago the Giants \"really believe\" Cruz will play this year . Now it's just a question of when, and if that return date will in fact end up beating any hypothetical short-term IR cutoff.
