Former Harrier, Justin Richards, heads in the second goal for the Glassboys. \nGlassboys boss Gary Hackett made just one change from the team which lost 2-1 to Ilkeston on Monday, with fit-again Dodd replacing the suspended Ben Billingham. \nOpposite number Hockaday made three changes, with on-loan Albion defender Kyle Howkins coming straight into the team for Lathaniel Rowe-Turner. \nJordan Jones replaced Callum Hassan up front, while there was a change in goal, with Alex Palmer - another Albion loanee - coming in for Dean Snedker. \nIt was a change called into question after just five minutes, when Palmer was badly at fault for Stour’s opener. \nAfter a corner has been returned into the box, the goalkeeper failed to make a clean connection on a punch under pressure from Richards. \nThe loose ball fell to Dodd, who squeezed home a shot from ten yards out despite Palmer seemingly getting plenty behind it. \nNeither was the Baggies loanee blameless for the second, as Richards, left completely unmarked from Broadhurst’s free-kick, headed home with the goalkeeper rooted to his line. \nPalmer, at least, redeemed himself slightly with a smart save from a Leon Broadhurst free-kick, after Kelvin Langmead had clumsily felled Kyle Hawley on the edge of the box. Stourbridge 3 Kidderminster Harriers 0 Chris Lait of Stourbridge and Jared Hodgkiss of Kidderminster. \nStourbridge (4-4-2): Solly, Green, Scarr, Pierpoint (c), Smikle, Dodd (Wright 88), Tonks, Broadhurst, Lait (Canavan 64), Hawley (Knight 86), Richards. \nSubs not used: Harris, Wright, Penny, Price (gk). \nKidderminster Harriers (4-3-3): Palmer, Hodgkiss, Howkins, Langmead, Young, Dinsley, Maxwell, Whitfield, Jones (Hassan 58), Styche (Singh 75), Francis-Angol (Green 79). \nSubs not used: Rowe-Turner, Tunnicliffe, Forsyth, Snedker (gk). \nStour looked dangerous with every attack, while Harriers only found dead ends. \nTheir best chance of the half came when home skipper Stuart Pierpoint passed straight to Zaine Francis-Angol. \nThe striker advanced to the edge of the box but though his shot beat goalkeeper Lewis Solly, a recovering Pierpoint was able to clear from under his own bar. \nAs half-time approached, Richards flashed a shot from distance just wide, as Stourbridge looked likely to increase their lead. \nJones, almost out of nothing, hit the corner of post and bar with a header. Harriers desperately needed the next goal. \nBut, just seven minutes into the second-half, the Glassboys had it to all but put the game to bed. \nLait cut in from the left wing and placed his shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards out, prompting some supporters in the away end to head toward the exit. \nThings continued to go from bad to worse for their side, who saw a great chance to pull one back after substitute Callum Hassan, through on goal after a mistake by Pierpoint, blazed over.
