Comment Follow @@LDLDanielGreen Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 2:45 PM In the first round of the Class 4A playoffs last year, the Leesville Wampus Cats took to the road for a matchup against the Rayne Wolves. The ball didn’t bounce in the Wampus Cats’ favor on that night, falling to the Wolves, 36-22. Leesville (3-3, 0-1) enters Friday night’s 7 p.m. contest against the Wolves (1-5, 0-1) looking to break a two-game losing streak in front of the returning alumni as this game is serving as the Wampus Cats’ homecoming contest. “Rayne is a good physical team,” Leesville head coach Tommy Moore said. “But just like our last two games, they are a better team than their record shows. Hopefully, we can learn from our past mistakes and pick up a win Friday night.” Leesville is mired in a two-game losing streak, both losses coming at the hands of teams with just one prior win. The Cats dropped a 34-27 decision to 1-win Iowa two weeks ago, while falling last week to 1-win Washington-Marion, 19-14. Rayne is coming off a 32-7 loss at the hands of the LaGrange Gators and are a much different team than they were a year ago. The bulk of the running game is gone, with the exception of Deontrey Wilridge, who has rushed for just over 500 yards this season. Also, the Wolves are expected to start Jaylon Reed at quarterback, who threw for 186 yards and three touchdowns last year against Leesville. However, the Wolves have been struggling through a bout with injuries and several players have lined up at different spots for them thus far. Despite the injuries, Moore expects Rayne to come ready to play. “Records really don’t mean anything and we’ve seen that the past couple of weeks,” Moore said. “They are a good football team and we need to be ready to play.” Last week’s loss to Washington-Marion delivered quite a sting to the Wampus Cats, according to Moore. But he is also quick to point out that the team has moved past that and has put together some good practices this week, despite the distraction of homecoming. “The kids are having a good time with all the homecoming stuff, but they also realize we have a game to play,” Moore said. “The kids have had good practices this week and have seemed to put the loss to Washington-Marion behind them. They know they need to be ready to play.” Over the past couple of weeks, the Wampus Cat running game has struggled as junior Cory McCoy, who found the endzone 16 times in the first four weeks of the season, has only gained 113 yards on 31 carries the past two weeks and hasn’t scored. Page 2 of 2 - For the season, McCoy has rushed for 1,069 yards and 16 touchdowns, while senior quarterback Caden Wheeler has rushed for just over 500 yards, while passing for nearly 400 more. Defensively, the Wampus Cats will look to the exploits of David Kava, Sabian Matuu and Jaelyn Edwards to slow down the Wolves. The game can be heard live on 93.5-FM KJAE with Sam Fertitta and Chuck Owen on the call.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:00:45.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
