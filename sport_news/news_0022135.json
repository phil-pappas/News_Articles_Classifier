Guerrero is also Brady’s business partner at TB12 Sports Therapy Center .\nBrady answered questions about Guerrero Monday on “Dennis and Callahan,” WEEI’s morning show, but Hasselbeck found those answers unsatisfactory.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below “It’s funny. In some ways, guys, it just is somewhat alarming,” Hasselbeck said. “Just not even addressing what you were talking about, the issue that you were asking.”\nDuring Monday’s interview, Brady chuckled uncomfortably and preached his ideals about proper diet and injury prevention. He said America was “brainwashed,” and people were getting improper education on their diet. But he barely addressed Guerrero’s troubling history, reported by Boston Magazine . Guerrero and the Federal Trade Commission came to a settlement on his false claims about Supreme Greens, and the FTC ordered that he pay a $65,000 fine or turn in his 2004 Cadillac Escalade.\n“If you are arguably the best quarterback of all-time and at your disposal you literally could partner with anybody on the planet to make an impact on whatever you are called to do, are you going to choose the guy that acted like he was dealing with 200 terminally ill cancer patients?” Hasselbeck asked.\nBrady went to bat for Guerrero .\n“In the 10 or 11 years we’ve been working together, he’s never been wrong,” Brady said.\nIn 2011, Guerrero was selling NeuroSafe, a product he claimed helped prevent concussions. Guerrero did not have “ reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the extraordinary claims ,” the FTC wrote in a letter. The FTC investigated the product, but declined to act upon Guerrero’s false claims, because he sold limited inventory, discontinued the product, and refunded purchasers.\n“To me, something is not adding up here when I see this guy that I think is a great guy, always with these bad guys. When that happens, you then say, ‘OK, maybe he’s not who I thought he was,’ ” Hasselbeck said. “It doesn’t prove that’s the case—it certainly makes you wonder.”\nTop 10 Recent Patriots Controversies, Ranked\nPrevious -- of -- Next The Patriot’s successes over the past two decades have not come without controversy.
