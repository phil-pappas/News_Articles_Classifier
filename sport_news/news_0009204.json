The victim, an adult female, reported that while loading her vehicle with items she purchased at the store, a male subject approached her and stole her purse. Witnesses told police that the suspect fled on a bicycle towards Monarch Drive.\nAbout two hours later, detectives recovered the woman's purse after the suspect was hit by a car. Police say the thief was hiding under a vehicle in the area when the car's owner attempted to drive away, not knowing he was underneath.\nThe subject again fled the scene. His injuries are unknown at this time.\nThe sheriff's department reports it is in the process of obtaining video surveillance of the incident.\nAnyone with information concerning this matter should contact Crimestoppers at 1-800-743-7433 or TPSO at 876-2500.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
