Transcript \nOklahoma guard Buddy Hield picked up where his junior season ended. He was named the Big 12 Conference men’s basketball preseason player of the year Thursday. The award was bestowed by a vote of the league’s coaches. \nThe senior was a unanimous selection on the preseason All-Big 12 first team. \n“We are very excited and happy for Buddy to be recognized by league coaches with this honor,” OU coach Lon Kruger said. “It’s certainly well-deserved, as Buddy is one of the hardest working and motivated individuals I’ve coached. He is an exceptional leader who has high aspirations for our team this season.” \nHield was the league’s player of the year last season. He topped the Big 12 in scoring a year ago with 17.4 points per game, increasing that to a league-best average of 18.5 points in conference games. Hield earned Associated Press All-America Third Team accolades following his junior season. \nHield becomes OU’s fourth Big 12 Preseason Player of the Year, joining Blake Griffin (2008-09), Taj Gray (2005-06) and Hollis Price (2002-03). \nJoining Hield on the preseason first team are: Rico Gathers (Baylor), Georges Niang (Iowa State), Perry Ellis (Kansas) and Isaiah Taylor (Texas). \nIowa State junior Deonte Burton was named preseason newcomer of the year while Kansas’ Cheick Diallo was named preseason freshman of the year. \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:48:23.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
