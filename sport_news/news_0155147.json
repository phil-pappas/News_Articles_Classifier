(AP) - A group of 18th century military re-enactors is setting off on a 15-mile march along the route in eastern New York taken by British and Colonial American soldiers heading home for the winter.\nAbout 20 French and Indian War re-enactors plan to leave Friday morning from Fort William Henry in the village of Lake George Friday and head south on a bike path and trail to the village of Fort Edward. The route roughly follows the original Military Road built at the start of the war in 1755.\nAt Fort Edward, the marchers will set up camp on Rogers Island, where more than 100 re-enactors will have an \"end of campaign\" encampment Saturday and Sunday.\nThe weekend encampment at the Rogers Island Visitors Center will feature staged skirmishes, demonstrations of camp life and other activities.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
