Jeff has played in the sectional final the past two seasons, but got beat by the host Highlanders both teams. The Red Devils’ last sectional title came in 2012. \nMonday’s sectional opener took extra time and penalty kicks, but Corydon Central defeated Charlestown in a 3-1 penalty-kick shootout. Both teams were tied at one at the end of regulation. \nJeff and the Panthers will square off at 5 p.m. Wednesday in the first semifinal. Wednesday’s second semifinal will pit two-time defending sectional champion Floyd Central against New Albany at about 7 p.m. The championship game will be at 2 p.m. Saturday. \nJEFF 3, SILVER CREEK 0 \nJeff scored two first-half goals and the lone goal of the second half in its blanking of the Dragons. Senior Ben Mann had two goals and Leo Puentes added another to send the Red Devils to the semifinals. \n“It was a chippy game,” said Jeffersonville head coach Carson Webb. “I thought Silver Creek played really well. We just played them in one of our last games of the season, and our guys thought they knew what to expect.” \n“It went back and forth, that’s for sure. With the large field, we got two spread out, especially going forward,” said Silver Creek coach Colin Bell. \nA penalty kick was called on the Dragons 12 minutes into the match and Mann converted it to open the scoring for Jeffersonville. \nWith 10 minutes left in the first half, Silver Creek’s Leonel Esparza sent a long free kick past Red Devils’ goalkeeper Zab Ramirez, But it rattled off of the crossbar. \nPuentes scored off of a free kick only a few minutes later, prompting a red card and sending off of Silver Creek’s Andrew Posante for arguing the call. \n“In tournament games like this, it can come down to set pieces and we were fortunate enough to be able to finish those,” said Webb. \nAs the game became more heated, Mann received a yellow card. \nTen minutes into the second half, Mann had another opportunity to score, receiving a pass from Puentes that allowed him to take a shot that was saved by Dragons keeper Bryson Barnicott. \nThere were not many more chances to be had until Mann found the net, scoring a goal with five minutes left in regulation. \n“I thought my shot was going wide left, but I was fortunate that it hit the crossbar and bounced into the back of the net,” said Mann. \n“We had the majority of the possession, so I was quite impressed with that because that’s how we always try to play,” concluded Bell. “Jeffersonville always has a strong team and they are senior-led and senior-strong. When we get opportunities, we just have to finish them.” \nCORYDON 1, CHARLESTOWN 1 (CORYDON WINS ON PK’s 3-1) \nThe first half was scoreless, but there were opportunities created. \nCorydon found themselves one-on-one with Charlestown keeper Matthew Parrella a few times, but the freshman was able to contain the Panthers. \nSophomore Drew Uesseler opened the scoring for Corydon at the beginning of the second half, and the Pirates’ Andrew Mattingly equalized the score nearly 20 minutes later and the game eventually was forced into overtime. \nThe teams remained scoreless in the two seven-minute extra periods, and the game was forced into penalty kicks. Corydon keeper Nathan Shehorn saved two shots in the shootout, including the one to clinch the win. \nCLASS 2A FLOYD CENTRAL SECTIONAL \nFIRST ROUND \nCORYDON CENTRAL 1, CHARLESTOWN 1 (Corydon wins penalty-kick shootout, 3-1.) \nCharlestown 0 1 0 0—1 \nCorydon Central 0 1 0 0—1 \nSCORING SUMMARY \nCC — Drew Uesseler, 42nd minute. \nCh — Andrew Mattingly, 60th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:42:13.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
