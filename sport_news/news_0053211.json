But the true freshman wasn't alone. Logan Laurent, the team's sophomore punter who got some run as Lucas' replacement last season, has also been lining up to kick in practice. \nThough Whipple never gave official word, it seems likely that Caggiano will take over the job. \nLaurent has experience on PATs and field goals, but he's also the team's full-time punter. And he's done such a good job with that – his 43.1-yard average currently third in the Mid-American Conference – that it wouldn't make much sense to do anything to throw him off his game unless absolutely necessary. \nWe'll see Saturday at 3 p.m., but all signs point to Caggiano. Here are a few things that stood out from speaking with the true freshman kicker earlier this week. \nWhile splitting reps with Laurent, Caggiano's mindset has been, not un expectedly, that the kicking job is his to lose: \n\"Yeah, of course. Right now, Logan and I are competing for the job. I've just got to go out there every day like I'm protecting my spot.\" \nAsked about making his debut in front of 80,000 people at Notre Dame, Caggiano was up front in admitting, yes, he felt some nerves before lining up for his first extra point try: \n\"Of course. Every kicker gets nervous on their first kick, especially when it's in front of all those people on national television. It's something that every kicker has to do. It was fun for my first time. I got up there and let all the nerves go away, blocked everything out and I just pushed it through.\" \nWhile the forecast has improved considerably, there's still likely to be less-than-desireable wind conditions Saturday at McGuirk Stadium against Florida International. Caggiano has made sure to use this week to get used to the kicking environment: \n\"The wind blows from this angle (from the Football Performance Center end) and blows diagonally (toward the open end of the stadium). I got some first-hand experience tonight. I've just got to adjust. Being a kicker, you've got to prepare for these things and practice for them. That's what I did tonight. I got a lot of balls in aiming for a certain point. So I've just got to test the wind, see which way it's blowing and how hard it's blowing.\" \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:50:36.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
