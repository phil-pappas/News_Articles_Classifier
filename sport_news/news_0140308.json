As it turned out, it was also Austin’s final appearance at Taylor Field as the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ starting quarterback. \nOn that Saturday afternoon, Austin and Flutie treated 26,137 fans to one of the all-time great demonstrations of quarterbacking. They combined for 1,088 aerial yards, thus becoming the first CFLers to collaboratively exceed the 1,000 mark in one game. \nAustin piled up 546 yards, four more than Flutie, as Saskatchewan outlasted the visiting Calgary Stampeders 48-45. The difference was a 34-yard, tiebreaking field goal by the legendary Robokicker, Dave Ridgway, in the waning seconds. \n“I remember the game well,” Ridgway recalls, “because it was hard not to appreciate what we were getting to see.” \nOver time, though, that classic contest has been largely forgotten. In fact, it was rendered an afterthought by day’s end. \nAt 9:39 p.m., Saskatchewan time, Carter’s three-run, walk-off home run off the Philadelphia Phillies’ Mitch Williams gave the Blue Jays their second successive World Series title. Carter’s circuit shot enabled Toronto to post an 8-6 victory over Philadelphia in Game 6 of the 1993 Fall Classic. \nMeanwhile, at Regina’s Agridome, some people were wondering what, exactly, had transpired. \nThat evening, the Regina Pats were playing host to the Red Deer Rebels in a sparsely attended WHL game. Suddenly, with the third period underway, there was a standing ovation in the edifice now known as the Brandt Centre. The players, especially, did not know what to think. \n“Red Deer had just gotten a penalty,” Cory Dosdall, who was then a right winger with the Pats, told this scribbler after the game. “I figured everyone was getting pretty excited.” \nOh, they were — because the sixth (and ultimately final) game of the 1993 World Series was being shown on the arena’s big screen. \nAny of the Pats patrons who were actually watching the hockey game suddenly realized what else was happening. Far away from the epicentre of the championship celebration in Toronto, Regina hockey fans — 1,752 of them, anyway — responded to Carter’s home run in robust fashion. \nThe Pats lost 6-4, by the way. \nLater that night, CBC’s telecast of the Roughriders-Stampeders shootout — which had been blacked out in Saskatchewan — was rebroadcast on local television. The game was just as riveting to watch the second time around. \nFlutie was, well, Flutie. Within a month, he would win his third of six CFL most-outstanding-player awards. Austin was never honoured in that fashion, partially because some of his peak years coincided with Flutie’s heyday. That is immaterial to Ridgway. \n“Quite frankly, in my opinion, Kent was just as good a quarterback as Doug Flutie,” the Hall of Fame kicker says. \n“Anyone who ever saw Kent play at his peak in games such as (that of Oct. 23, 1993) could never argue his greatness. \n“And this game wasn’t an anomaly. He had plenty of others.” \nIn the 1989 Grey Cup game, for example, Austin threw for 474 yards and three touchdowns before Ridgway kicked a last-second, game-winning field goal from 35 yards away to give Saskatchewan a 43-40 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at SkyDome — the very place where Carter famously cleared the left-field fence against the Phillies. \nThe 1989 Grey Cup is widely regarded as the greatest game in CFL history. But if you disregard the high stakes of Nov. 26, 1989 and simply assess a game on the basis of its pure entertainment value, that championship contest was not any better than the Roughriders-Stampeders air show of Oct. 23, 1993. \nThe proceedings also included a record performance by the Roughriders’ Ray Elgaard, who early in the fourth quarter became the CFL’s all-time receiving-yardage leader. \nElgaard, who is now seventh on the career list, received a well-deserved standing ovation at Taylor Field after reaching one of his many milestones. \nLater that day, the attendees at the Agridome also rose to their feet to salute Carter’s clout — whereupon many Reginans flocked to Albert Street to rejoice over another Blue Jays championship. \nThere was merriment, but also a mess. The street was littered with broken beer bottles. Six people were briefly under arrest for being intoxicated. A handful of other demonstrative citizens were detained for breaching the peace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:01:17.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
