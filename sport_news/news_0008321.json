Today: the outfield.\nProjections for the Rockies' 2016 outfield begin with a question: Will general manager Jeff Bridich trade one of the team's stars in the outfield to improve the starting pitching?\nMost of that trade speculation centers on right fielder Carlos Gonzalez, who broke free from an awful two-month slump to finish with 40 home runs, 97 RBIs, a .271 batting average and an .864 OPS. But it's certainly possible that teams will ask about center fielder Charlie Blackmon and left fielder Corey Dickerson.\nGonzalez, 29, proved he's still a premier outfielder. The only thing he doesn't do anymore is steal bases. In 2010, when he was an MVP candidate with a .336 average and 34 home runs, he stole a career-high 26 bases. This season he swiped two.\nGonzalez will make $17 million in 2016 and $20 million in 2017 before becoming a free agent, so now might be the prime time to move him. Bridich, however, sounds intent on keeping him.\nWATCH: Is it time for the Rockies to trade Carlos Gonzalez?\nAdvertisement \"If this organization was ever hellbent on moving CarGo, we wouldn't be sitting here talking about him,\" Bridich said toward the end of the season. \"We believe in what he can do with us, what he has done with us. It's a big piece to have in your lineup and it's a big piece defensively to have in right field, especially when you consider the type of arm he still has.\"\nBlackmon, an all-star in 2014, was a slightly better offensive player in 2015, increasing his on-base percentage from .335 to .347. He also swiped a career-high 43 bases, 15 more than in 2014. Defensively he struggles to cover the vast acreage of Coors Field. According to FanGraphs, Blackmon is not a plus-defender. His defensive runs above average (Def) was minus-5.9, ranking 20th among major-league center fielders.\nDickerson, who belted 24 home runs in 2014, dealt with chronic left foot plantar fasciitis and a fractured rib in 2015. He has improved defensively but has a below-average arm.\nBrandon Barnes is a valuable fourth outfielder because he can play all three positions, but he hit only .251, with a .314 on-base percentage.\nColorado Rockies Jeff Bridich, Senior Vice President/General Manager holds a press conference July 28, 2015 to talk about the Troy Tulowitzki trade to the Toronto Blue Jays. ( John Leyba, The Denver Post ) Kyle Parker, a 2010 first-round draft choice, is running out of chances. He looked overmatched this season, hitting .179 in 112 plate appearances.\nKeep an eye on two promising outfield prospects: David Dahl, the top pick in 2012, and Raimel Tapia, a 21-year-old left-handed hitter from the Dominican Republic.\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders @denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1014/20151014__jeff-bridich~p1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:11:06.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
