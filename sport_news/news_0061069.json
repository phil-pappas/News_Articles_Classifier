The last two spots were still up for grabs, and U.S. Open champion Flavia Pennetta also was in Moscow in hope of securing one of them. She was playing her first match later Wednesday. \nAfter easily taking the first set, Pavlyuchenkova, last year’s Kremlin Cup winner, failed to convert her only match point in the second with Safarova serving at 6-5. She then double-faulted on her opponent’s first set point in the tiebreaker. \nReclaiming control in the decider, the Russian got the win when Safarova hit a volley long.
