Monroe-Woodbury: The Crusaders’ defense suffered a rough stretch against Newburgh. But the unit once again showed that no offense is safe, recovering four fumbles. 2. Newburgh: Any team that scores 20 points in seven minutes and allows just seven points in a half to Monroe-Woodbury should hold its head high. 3. Cornwall: The Green Dragons continue to dominate, outscoring their last four opponents 176-13. 4. Valley Central: The Vikings have a chance at the Section 9 Class AA’s top overall seed by beating Pine Bush by more than 14 points. But Valley Central still will have much to prove in the playoffs against the league’s elite. 5. Warwick: The Wildcats stumbled against Valley Central but showed they can rebound from tough losses with a blowout win over Roosevelt and a hard-fought victory over Minisink Valley. Class B-D 1. Marlboro: The Iron Dukes look to finish the regular season undefeated Friday against one-win Highland. Marlboro performed spectacularly again with 472 rushing yards against Wallkill last Friday. 2. Liberty: The undefeated Indians get a Section 9 Class C semifinal preview Saturday against Sullivan West. But the Bulldogs’ injuries should allow Liberty to stay undefeated. 3. Millbrook: The Blazers defended Chester well in last Friday’s 30-26 victory, their fifth straight. 4. Chester: The Hambletonians fared poorly against Section 9 Class C’s other powerhouses with losses to Liberty and Millbrook. But losing by only four against Millbrook can give Chester hope for the playoffs. 5. Spackenkill: The Spartans face Goshen with three straight dominating divisional victories. The game will further determine Spackenkill’s strength for sectionals. recordonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:51:52.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
