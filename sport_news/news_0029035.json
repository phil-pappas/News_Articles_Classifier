Cassel, who will supplant Kellen Moore once he's comfortable calling plays, will provide insurance for Weeden. Might even eventually beat him out.\nCertainly there's no argument here with acquiring a guy with experience in a deal that includes an exchange of draft picks, too. Cassel has started 71 games, nearly four times Weeden's total. He was also a contender in Buffalo before losing out to Tyrod Taylor, a former sixth-round pick by Baltimore who turned into a find this summer.\nEither your back-up needs to be a veteran with a lot of starts under his belt, or a kid you're developing. Weeden doesn't really fit either model.\nJason Garrett would argue that Taylor, the kid who beat out Cassel in Buffalo, is an indictment of drafting quarterbacks and developing them. Baltimore used the pick and spent the time, and now Buffalo gets the benefit.\nThe counterpoint: Green Bay, which has a history of drafting, developing and peddling quarterbacks, sometimes for multiple picks.\nPretty good investment plan, if you ask me.\nOver Jerry Jones' quarter-century of ownership, he's drafted four quarterbacks, two in his very first year in charge of socks and jocks: Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh, who came in the supplemental draft.\nSince then, it's been Bill Musgrave (fourth round, in '91), Quincy Carter (second, 2001) and Stephen McGee (fourth, '09).\nGiven the history since Aikman, maybe you could see why Jerry isn't crazy about spending draft picks on quarterbacks. Romo was a free agent, right? And an all-time find, too.\nStill, it's time for Jerry to take some of the drafting acumen his organization has shown lately and use it on a quarterback. Romo's time is running out, as we saw again Sunday, and it's past time for the Cowboys to start planning a future without him.\nBecause, if you count Jameill Showers, the Cowboys own five quarterbacks, and there may not be not enough future in all of them put together to outlast the owner.\nFollow Kevin Sherrington on Twitter @KSherringtonDMN\nMORE COWBOYS OPINION, ANALYSIS\nMoore: How many wins Cowboys need in next 8 games to claim NFC East and how they can get 'em\nUpon Further Review: In wake of Romo injury, re-thinking season predictions ... plus Sunday picks vs. Falcons\nSherrington: Trading for Matt Cassel more proof Cowboys are all in for 2015; will he eventually beat out Weeden?\nPhilly columnist: Eagles' loss to Cowboys 'a sheer nightmare;' DeMarco Murray bears least blame\nGosselin: Falcons have their own version of Tony Romo, complete with playoff failures\nWHAT PLAYERS, COACHES SAY Cole Beasley on running the 'same offense' with Brandon Weeden, and his advice on getting rid of spiders\nRon Leary doesn't plan on splitting time Sunday against Atlanta\nChip Kelly 'embarrassed' by Eagles' performance against Cowboys\nNate Newton: What I liked and didn't like about game vs. Eagles\nCowboys DE Jeremy Mincey responds to Eagles WR saying coaches called out play-calls: 'It might have felt like that'\nJerry Jones: 'Good chance' Cowboys defense can carry the load until Bryant, Romo get back\nCowboys' Jerry Jones would love to show he can win in 'fourth quarter' of his life\nJerry Jones: Our starter is Brandon Weeden, and 'you won't see a more gifted passer'\nDez replacement?
