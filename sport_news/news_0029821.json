Milan star Keisuke Honda and Leicester City striker Shinji Okazaki scored in a 15-minute period before Takashi Usami 's late goal wrapped up a 3-0 win for Japan. \nThe result means Japan leapfrog Syria at the top of Group E. \nDespite this defeat, Syria is well placed to advance to the next stage of qualifying -- it has nine points from four matches and is two points ahead of third-place Singapore. \nRanked 123rd in the world, Syria has thrashed both Afghanistan, ranked 27 places higher, and Cambodia 6-0 on the road. It also beat Singapore 1-0 in front of 100 fans at the Sultan Quaboos Stadium in the Omani city of Muscat in September. \nProtests against the government and President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 plunged Syria into a chaotic war which is still raging today. \nFighter jets announced Russia's arrival on the ever-growing list of nations who have bombed Syria when it launched airstrikes on Wednesday. \nA coalition of countries led by the U.S. have been bombing ISIS targets on a near-daily basis since last September, in the hopes of rooting out the terror group from its strongholds in the country. \nBut Russia's involvement marks a new and uncertain chapter in a war that has now killed more than 250,000 people since 2011 and displaced 10.6 million people from home -- about half of Syria's pre-war population. \nAccording to James Dorsey, the author of the \"Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer\", Assad uses the soccer team to give the regime \"a degree of prestige.\" \nHe told The Guardian it shows \"a sense of normality amid the mayhem.\" \nSyria's next fixture see it welcome Afghanistan to its temporary home. A fixture would put its qualification campaign back on track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:50:42.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
