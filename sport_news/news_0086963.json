Powell wrote in “Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen” that McGee paid her $10,000 for 22 shows from 2010 through ’14 with many taking place at the players’ dormitory.\nPitino has denied knowledge of the activities described in Powell’s book.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:19:42.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
