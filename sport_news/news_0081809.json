A federal appeals court shot down 2nd Amendment constitutional challenges to gun control laws passed in New York and Connecticut following the 2012 massacre of children at Sandy Hook elementary school.\nThe 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals Monday upheld almost all of the laws enacted by Gov. Cuomo in New York and Gov. Malloy in Connecticut prohibiting the possession of certain semi-automatic assault weapons and large capacity magazine clips.\nSeveral upstate gun owners groups had sued to overturn the laws, arguing that they violated the 2nd Amendment by infringing upon an individual’s right to bear arms.\nThe three-judge panel sitting in Lower Manhattan upheld the “core provisions” of the post-Sandy Hook laws in both states, including the so-called SAFE Act pushed by Cuomo that was attacked by upstate gun owners.\nIn January of 2013, Gov. Cuomo signed into law the NY SAFE Act that gave New York State the toughest gun laws in the nation. The New York law bars ownership of specific assault weapons and makes it illegal to fully load magazines that hold 10 rounds. It tightened up an assault weapon ban already on the books, and allowed anybody who already owned one of these guns to keep it, as long as they registered that ownership with the state police.\nThe ruling was not a total victory for gun control proponents, however. The court ruled that New York’s law regulating how many bullets can be loaded into a magazine does violate the 2nd Amendment, as does Connecticut’s law barring possession of non-semiautomatic Remington 7615 rifles.\nThe gun owners had argued that assault weapons are in common use and that they’re typically used by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. The states of New York and Connecticut argued that assault weapons are disproportionately used in crimes and rarely for self-defense or hunting.\nMike Groll/AP Gun rights advocates hold signs as they demonstrate outside the Capitol on Feb. 28, 2013, in Albany, N.Y. The court conceded that the New York and Connecticut laws do impinge upon a gun owner’s 2nd Amendment privileges, but found the laws withstand a challenge because they don’t ban all forms of semi-automatic weapons — “only a limited subset of semiautomatic firearms which contain one or more enumerated military-style features.”\nTom King, president of the NRA-affiliated New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, vowed to appeal, calling the ruling a “mixed bag” because it upheld a lower court ruling that nixed the 7-round capacity limit, but he expressed disappointment with the rest of it.\n“Are we happy? We are not,” he said. “Absolutely we are going to take it to the Supreme Court. That was our plan. That is what we said from day one.”\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman applauded the court’s ruling, stating, “I am very pleased that the Court upheld almost every aspect of the law. Now that the Court has ruled, it is time for everyone involved in the critical debate about how to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous and unstable people to come together to work toward sensible solutions that will keep our communities safe.”\nTags: New York , Connecticut , gun control", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:15:03.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
