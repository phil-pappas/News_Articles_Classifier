Stingy defense. An unflappable bullpen.\nEven a little help from replay.\n\"Just battling,\" first baseman Eric Hosmer said. \"That's what this team does so well.\"\nThe Royals rallied from a three-run deficit Friday, getting a go-ahead single from Ben Zobrist in the seventh inning, and then watched Wade Davis and the bullpen make it stand in a 5-4 victory that brought back memories of their nip-and-tuck postseason of a year ago.\nThe Royals knotted the game at 4 off Scott Kazmir and relievers Oliver Perez and Josh Fields in the sixth. Kansas City took the lead in the seventh when Alcides Escobar led off with a triple against Will Harris (0-1) and Zobrist followed with his single through the left side.\nKelvin Herrera (1-0) and Ryan Madson each tossed a scoreless inning for the Royals, and Davis came on to close it — though the real drama was only beginning.\nDavis walked Preston Tucker with one out, and speedy Carlos Gomez came in as a pinch-runner. Davis snapped a throw to Hosmer at first, and he neatly snagged it on one hop as Gomez made a dive back to the bag. Gomez was initially ruled safe, but the call was overturned upon review.\n\"That play that Hos made on the pickoff, I don't know if there's a lot of first basemen that can make that play,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"It was tremendous.\"\nJose Altuve then grounded out to end it, giving Davis the save. It was a crucial victory considering what awaits Kansas City in Game 3 on Sunday: Astros ace Dallas Keuchel, who was 15-0 at home this season. Edinson Volquez will start for Kansas City.\n\"We were in position to win that game. Their bullpen did a very good job of shutting us down,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \"We've got some work to do to win this series. It's going to be a good series. These are two really good teams.\"\nTwo starters acquired with October in mind, Kazmir and Royals counterpart Johnny Cueto, pitched mostly to a stalemate Friday, which meant the outcome hinged on the bullpens. Kansas City's relief corps was simply better, preserving the first win by a home team this postseason. They compete,\" said Salvador Perez, who homered for the Royals. \"Pretty good stuff.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:33.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
