The coach sneaked his team out of Starkville to East Lansing, Michigan, to face a Loyola-Chicago squad that featured four black starters in the NCAA Tournament. \nThe contest has been celebrated as one of the most important moments for racial change in the South. Recently, it was named one of the Top 25 defining moments in college sports history. \nIt’s spawned the writing of two books and a documentary. There is ongoing discussions about a possible movie. \nMcCarthy died in 1975 at the age of 51. \nPrior to his tenure at MSU, he coached Baldwyn High School to a boys state basketball championship in 1948. After his tenure in Starkville ended, he had a successful career in the American Basketball Association (ABA) in New Orleans, Memphis, Dallas, and Louisville. \nThe unveiling ceremony will take place at 2 p.m. at the corner of Main Street and Front Street in Baldwyn. A reception will begin an hour before that at 1 p.m. at Lula Lee’s restaurant at the corner of Main Street and Second Street. Former MSU players and coaches, family and friends of McCarthy are expected to be in attendance. 16 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1LH7Nvk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:52:42.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
