Quarterback is the focal point of a football team, in leadership and making an offense succeed. It’s hard to win with an average one, unless you have a downright dominant defense. The Missouri Valley Football Conference is loaded with play-making quarterbacks. Five rank among the top 33 nationally in the Football Championship Subdivision for total offense (Southern Illinois’ Mark Iannotti, South Dakota State’s Zach Lujan, North Dakota State’s Carson Wentz, Indiana State’s Matt Adam and Western Illinois’ Trenton Norvell). \nThe one Missouri State will see on Saturday might be the best of all. Tre Roberson had 4,250 yards in total offense last season, confounding defenses with his legs (11 rushing touchdowns) and throwing arm (30 passing TDs). This season, Roberson’s statistics are skewed a bit. He suffered a hand injury that’s limited him the last two games and is averaging a rather pedestrian 161.6 yards per games, ninth in the Valley. Don’t be fooled. Roberson, a transfer from Indiana who fueled the Redbirds’ run to the FCS title game last season, is supposed to be healthy for Saturday’s game at Missouri State. Just when the Bears’ struggling defense didn’t need any more bad news, here it comes. After a 5-0 week running my season record of picking Valley games to 31-6 (.838) here’s a look at Saturday: Illinois State (4-1 overall, 2-0 Valley) at Missouri State (1-4, 0-2): After giving up 73 points at unranked Southern Illinois, the Bears return to Plaster Stadium for homecoming against the No. 4 Redbirds. Illinois State 56, Missouri State 17. Southern Illinois (2-3, 1-1) at Indiana State (3-2, 1-1): Teams that beat up on Missouri State the last two weeks meet in what should be the league’s most-competitive game of the week. Indiana State 42, Southern Illinois 38. South Dakota (2-3, 0-2) at North Dakota State (4-1, 2-0): The Bison set a Valley record for consecutive league victories (26) by rallying past the team that it shared the record with. North Dakota State 51, South Dakota 17. \nSouth Dakota State (4-1, 1-1) at Youngstown State (3-2, 1-1): After dropping a two-point home decision to Illinois State, this one seems a must-win if the Penguins are to be contenders. Youngstown State 24, South Dakota State 21. \nWestern Illinois (3-2) at Northern Iowa (2-3, 0-2): It's been a brutal stretch for the Panthers, who opened league play at Illinois State and North Dakota State. This one seems like a breather for them. Northern Iowa 34, Western Illinois 23.
