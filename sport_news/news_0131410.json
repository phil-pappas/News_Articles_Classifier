Neri also promised Tabal some singlets that the kids can use for their training. \nAside from her shining achievements, the kind of support Tabal poured into them has brought forth so much inspiration to the kids. \n“It is such heart-warming that parents and school children come up to me and say that I am their idol and that the kids themselves will say that they want to be like me,” said Tabal, whose stirring exploits in Milo has led her to a breakthrough stints in the prestigious Paris and Los Angeles Marathon. \nTabal is now slowly reaping the fruits of her efforts \nDuring the Cebu leg of the Milo Marathon, 37 selected members of the training pool joined the race for the first time and they made sure it’s going to be memorable one. \nThough she opted not to run for the Cebu race to take care of all the kids’ needs, Tabal felt every inch a winner after seeing three of CCSC’s bets landed at the top 10 in the 3K division that was participated in by 1,102 kids and adults alike. \nNine-year-old Jessel Ochia led the cast, who outpaced the more experienced entries and finished the race in 12 minutes. Two other kids from Guba in Carl John Beboso and Juvan Yongco, both 10 years old, wound up third and fifth, respectively. Beboso was only eight seconds behind top finisher Joseph Antiola. \nWhile Taba continue to train for higher aspirations like making it to the Boston Marathon and the Olympics, she assures that the kids they started to mold into becoming champions someday will not be left behind. \n“We have a training program for them, which their Physical Education teachers will implement on our behalf. We then go back there for monthly evaluation. \nAside from that, Tabal also takes times to sit down with the kids, reminding them to study hard and endure all the sacrifice they freely make while pursuing excellence in the sporting field. \n“They must always bear in mind the importance of education. Through running, they can be a winner but if they finish school, they can have better lives,” said the SEA Games silver medallist. \nSeeing herself in them when she was still in her struggling days as a runner, these kids are indeed in the right direction and leaning heading towards a bright future with Tabal as their beacon of hope and fountain of inspiration.
