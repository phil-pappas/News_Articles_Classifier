Chengelis breaks down Saturday's Michigan-Maryland game at Capital One Field at Byrd Stadium (noon, WWJ/BTN).\nTerrapins to watch \nWilliam Likely, KR/PR: He had outstanding freshman and sophomore seasons, and last season led the Big Ten and was ranked fourth nationally in kickoff return average (31.0). He was outstanding in the opener with a Big Ten record 233 punt return yards against Richmond. Likely has two punt returns for TDs. He leads the team with 122.2 all-purpose yards and has 20 tackles and five pass breakups and two forced fumbles.\nBrandon Ross, RB: The senior running back had 130 yards on 15 carries in a blowout loss at West Virginia last weekend. He has 358 rushing yards and has passed Billy Lovett for 13th on Maryland’s career rushing list – he has 1,943 career yards. He is averaging 4.1 yards a carry, fourth in the Big Ten.\nJermaine Carter Jr., LB: A sophomore, he leads the Big Ten in tackles (11.5, tied with Michigan State’s Riley Bullough). Carter had 14 tackles in the loss at West Virginia. He also leads the conference in solo tackles (7.5) and has combined with senior CB Sean Davis for 81 tackles. Davis is third in the Big Ten, averaging 6.5 solo tackles.\nIntangibles \nBlacking out: It’s supposed to be a “black out” at Byrd Stadium in College Park, Md., and the players will do their part wearing the hand-painted “Black Ops” version of their standard helmets. Maryland fans have been encouraged to wear black, and the Terrapins will wear all-black uniforms.\nTeams on the run: With the weather expected to play a large role, both teams will rely on their running games in all likelihood. Michigan is averaging 202.2 yards and has 10 TDs. Maryland is averaging 196.0 yards.\nTurning it over: Maryland is having an issue with INTs, with 12. Starting QB Caleb Rose has completed 50 percent of his attempts and thrown nine INTs. He had four INTs against West Virginia last weekend and was replaced by Daxx Garman.\nTaking their time: Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh wants an offense that controls the ball, and that’s what he has had this season. The Wolverines are ninth nationally in time of possession (34:20). This is not a good thing for Maryland, which is allowing teams an average 33:31 in time of possession.\nBalancing act: Michigan wants to split the run-pass 50-50, and it is pretty close to realizing that. The Wolverines have thrown for 776 yards and rushed for 809. QB Jake Rudock, turnover-free last week against BYU, has completed nearly 63 percent of his throws and is managing the balancing act.\nFacts and figures \n*Maryland is winless in three games wearing its “blacks ops” black uniform look. Maryland last wore them in a 37-15 loss at Michigan State last season.\n*Michigan’s Mario Ojemudia has recorded a tackle for loss in each of the four games.\n*Michigan is ranked in the top 10 nationally in six categories. The Wolverines have the nation’s No. 2 defense.\n*De’Veon Smith, Michigan’s lead tailback, needs 33 rushing yards to reach the 1,000 mark in his career.\n*Maryland gave up 45 points to Michigan on Sept. 29, 1990.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:07:13.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
