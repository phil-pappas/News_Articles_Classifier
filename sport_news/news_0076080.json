The player usually makes frequent contact, has good speed, a high on-base percentage and brings energy to the team. \nAlcides Escobar possesses all but one of the above — the lone exception being his .293 OBP during the regular season. Statistically, the case can be made that Royals manager Ned Yost should bat Escobar in the lower third of the order. But it’s hard to argue with success, and the Royals have enjoyed remarkable success in the win column since Escobar was moved to the top late last season and it worked again Friday at Kauffman Stadium. \nEscobar went 2 for 5 with a triple and scored the game-winning run in the Royals’ 5-4 victory against the Houston Astros in Game 2 of the American League Division Series. \n“It’s a really big win to go back with the series tied 1-1 right now,” Escobar said. “We know we have to face a tough pitcher in (Dallas) Keuchel in Game 3, but we’ll be ready.” \nEscobar’s triple went to the opposite field and rolled all the way to the wall. The Astros outfield was playing shallow and Escobar recalled that they also played him that way during the regular season. So when he swung at Josh Field’s first pitch — a 90 mph cutter — he didn’t try to pull it. Instead, he just went with it. And on the very next pitch, Escobar scored on an opposite-field single by Ben Zobrist. \n“That was a good triple,” Escobar said. “I knew if I was on in front of Zobrist and Lorenzo Cain or Eric Hosmer, they were going to get me home.” \nEscobar hit first for most of the regular season, but he struggled mightily in the second half. Yost eventually moved Alex Gordon and Ben Zobrist to the top spot in September, but that came with a cost. \nThe Royals were winning with Escobar batting leadoff, and they went into their swoon when he was bumped down. The last week of the season, Yost moved Escobar back to the leadoff spot and the Royals finished the regular season on a five-game winning streak. \nNow Yost is hoping his unconventional formula and faith in Escobar can somehow carry them to the ALCS. \n“Esky’s a special player,” Yost said. “He’s got the ability to step up and be confident and help you win baseball games. I like him. I think everybody’s real, real confident with him.” \nEscobar always has been a free swinger and he has a tendency to swing at the first pitch of the game. In their five-game win streak to close out the regular season, Escobar swung at the first pitch in every game. \nIn Game 1 on Thursday, Escobar took the first pitch, and the Royals ultimately lost. He went 0 for 4 with a strikeout. In Game 2, he swung and hit a foul ball in the dugout that nearly hit backup infielder Christian Colon. \nEscobar eventually popped out in his first at-bat, but the Royals went on to win and even the series. \nCoincidence? \n“I don't know what that is,” said Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer. “But when it works out for us, and when he gets a hit on the first pitch of the game, it kind of just sets the tone for us offensively. And at the same time for the opposing pitcher, it kind of puts him in a little hole.” \nRAISING CAIN — Cain went 1 for 4 to extend his postseason hitting streak to six games, dating back to last year’s World Series. Cain’s double started the Royals’ sixth-inning rally, and he eventually scored on a single from Eric Hosmer. \n“We’ve been trying to play our game, and I just tried to come through there and get the rally started and come through with a knock,” Cain said. “And then guys stepped up and swung the bats really well and we drove in runs and we found a way to get a big knock to get the lead.” \nRIOS GETS FIRST PLAYOFF HIT — Royals right fielder Alex Rios recorded his first postseason hit with a double in the third inning. Rios finished 1 for 3 with a run scored. He also just narrowly missed extra bases in the fifth inning when he stroked a ball down the line in left that landed just foul. \nRios was removed defensively for Paulo Orlando, who made his postseason debut, in the seventh. Orlando struck out in his only plate appearance. \nNOTES \n■ With Rasmus’ double in the first, he became the first player in big league history to record an extra-base hit in his first six playoff appearances. \n■ Perez’s homer in the second was the second of his postseason career. Perez also homered in Game 1 of last year’s World Series. \n■ First pitch was at 2:47 p.m. The temperature was 58 degrees with a north wind at 10 mph. \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:23:26.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
