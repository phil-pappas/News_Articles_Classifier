Two batters later, Gerardo Parra’s two-run single made it 5-1 and manager Joe Girardi would call on seven more relievers.\n\"I didn’t think he threw horrible,\" Girardi said of Pineda. \"The thing was, he’d thrown so many pitches. \"If we’re going to do anything in this [postseason], he has to be good and I don’t want to wear him down. That’s why I took him out. … I’ve got to protect him.\"\nPineda blamed faulty command of his slider for his early troubles, but he had it working later (no walks, five strikeouts). The right-hander added that he feels strong physically. \"[I’m] a little mad, a little angry,\" at yielding four runs on six hits.\nTANAKA TIME: Masahiro Tanaka threw a normal between-starts bullpen in preparation for Tuesday’s wild-card start, on his customary sixth day. \"I know how important the game is,\" Tanaka said through his interpreter. \"I just want to go out there and do my best, be able to contribute to the team’s win so we can advance to our next step.\"\nBRIEFS: Girardi’s next step is to finalize a wild-card roster that is wholly different than any he’s done previously, since it’s a one-game format. The Yankees will hold a workout at the Stadium this afternoon. … Justin Wilson and Andrew Miller each pitched one-third of an inning as a tuneup. Dellin Betances was rested.\nEmail: caldera@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:44:35.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
