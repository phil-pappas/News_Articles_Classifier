He is framed at 5-foot-10, 205 pounds, right about average for a college running back, and speaks with a soft certainty not common in newcomers. Out of the backfield, Vaughn leads the Illini run game with 392 yards and three touchdowns through six games, splitting carries with fifth-year senior Josh Ferguson in five of them. But when Ferguson exited the first half of Illinois’ Big Ten opener against Nebraska on Oct. 3, Vaughn was tossed into the fire and withstood the heat, rushing for 98 yards on the way to a 14-13 Illini victory. “I’m no longer considered a freshman on the field. I need to step up and help my team,” Vaughn said after the game. A week later, though, Vaughn looked more like a freshman than he had all season. When Illinois got the ball back trailing Iowa by six points late in the fourth quarter, Vaughn fumbled on the first play of a budding comeback drive and cost his team the game. As expected, he stayed quiet most of the plane ride home that night. “Something like that takes a day,” running backs coach Nathan Scheelhaase said. “It’s not a snap out of it right in the moment type of thing, just because you feel like the weight of that day is on you.” Scheelhaase, a former four-year starting quarterback for the Illinois, knows the feeling. Against Minnesota his junior year, Scheelhaase fumbled the ball away on a third-and-1 with 2:37 left in the game, his second fumble of that game. “Fortunately, I know what that feels like, so you’re able to help pick him up,” Scheelhaase said. Where some true freshmen might have wallowed, the bye week became an opportunity to refocus on the fundamentals and ball security for Vaughn, who considers himself his harshest critic. “Ke’Shawn’s more mature than the average freshman that I’ve ever seen,” senior offensive lineman Teddy Karras said. “We feel confident with Ke’Shawn being our every-down guy.” Part of that maturity comes with Vaughn knowing his strength: his patience, his smarts for the game, his quickness — his Twitter handle, @SpeedyKe5, even acknowledges what Scheelhaase describes as being “deceptively quick.” “There’s nothing you worry about him doing,” Scheelhaase said. “You’re don’t worry about him in pass protection, you don’t worry about him running routes, you don’t worry about him trying to make guys miss.” Page 2 of 2 - Not that Scheelhaase doesn’t think there is still room for Vaughn to grow. “I don’t think there is any one area that he would say right now, ‘Hey I’m the best in the Big Ten at this,’ and I think that’s where he wants to get,” he said. But now that Vaughn has gotten a taste of being both the hero and the villain, is he capable of moving forward? “Highly capable,” Scheelhaase said, smiling. “He’s got things that he for sure needs to work on, and he knows that, that’s the best part about it. “He’s got a chance to be really, really good for us.” Contact Jordan Wilson, wilsn07@yahoo.com, Twitter.com/ @Wilsonable07.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:23:41.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
