Dionte Lewis set a state record with his 364 yards receiving, surpassing Lombard Montini's Jordan Westerkamp, who had 353 yards in 2011, and Monticello's Noah Freemon, who had 348 last year. \nAlso, quarterback Jacob Napier's 474 yards passing were the third-most in H&R-area history, behind only Monticello's Brandon Wildman (602 last year) and Mattoon's Jared Pilson (514 in 2013). \n\"We saw some things on film -- we thought we would get singled-up in coverage and that's a matchup favorable for a couple of our guys,\" Warrensburg coach Scott Godfrey said. \"They came out like we thought, with some one-on-ones, and our guys got open.\" Not just defense \nPana's defense continued to dominate as the Panthers took another step toward their third undefeated and untied regular season in the team's 105-year history with a 35-7 win against Litchfield on Friday. \nWhile the defense has been the biggest improvement since last season, the Pana offense is also having its best season in Al Stupek's seven seasons as coach. At 38 points per game, it's nearly 10 points better than the 28.8 in 2010. \nIn Stupek's early seasons with Pana, size was a strength. While the Panthers had a spread package, it made more sense with the personnel they had to keep it simple. \n\"We've been running plays out of the spread since my first year, but with the big kids we had, it was kind of like, 'Who are we trying to fool?'\" Stupek said. \"We just got behind that size and we had some success.\" \nBut with a smaller team and a more dynamic player at quarterback in Rhett Zahradka, the passing attack has become a bigger part of Pana's offense this season. \n\"We always felt like our spread game needed a lift, so we started studying concepts and talking to coaching staffs from places like Springfield Sacred Heart-Griffin, Rochester, Williamsville and New Berlin,\" Stupek said. \"We listened and our offensive coordinator Terry Klein has come up with a nice little package. \n\"We're still under center from time to time, like on fourth-and-1. But now teams can't scheme to take away the run because we can throw and vice versa. And when you're trying to shut down a kid like Zahradka, that's a load.\" \nStupek also said Pana's offensive line is the most underrated part of the team, with Jeff Winter, Austin Gruber, Owen Herbord and Gabe Henschen among those anchoring the group. They're back \nIt wasn't that long ago that Newton was among the area's football elite. After Friday's win against Marshall, it appears those days are back. \nThe Eagles already have their most wins since 2007, and are 7-0 for the first time since 2006. That season was also the last time the Eagles won a conference championship -- they were in the Apollo then. Newton has to beat 5-2 Olney and 0-7 Paris to win its first Little Illini Conference title. \nThe win against previously unbeaten Marshall was easily Newton's biggest of the season. The Eagles scored 35 points against a Lions team that had allowed just seven points all season. Getting defensive \nMonticello was expected to outscore teams coming into the season, but it turns out the Sages' biggest strength has been defense. \nPlaying against a solid schedule that has included Class 3A No. 2 St. Joseph-Ogden, Class 2A No. 4 Maroa-Forsyth and Class 3A receiving votes Tolono Unity, plus a better-than-expected Macomb team that put up a season-high 33 against the Sages, Monticello has allowed just 13 points per game. \nMonticello has shut out two team and allowed six points or fewer four times in seven games. Underrated \nEffingham was expected to have a rebuilding year with a new coach in Brett Hefner after the retirement of Mike McDonald and just a handful of players with any experience returning from last year's Apollo Conference co-champion. \nAnd while the Hearts aren't likely to make the playoffs this season, they have been a pleasant surprise and are a team Mount Zion can no longer chalk up as a win in next Friday's matchup. \nThough Effingham (3-4) has lost its last two games, it played within a touchdown of 7-0 Taylorville and on Friday got within three points of Mattoon -- the team that will play Taylorville in Week 8 for the Apollo crown. \njconn@herald-review.com|(217) 421-7971", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:55:21.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
