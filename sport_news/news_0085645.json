Eastern Alamance comes in undefeated behind do it all John Lamot, while Western Alamance comes in at 5-1 on the season led by do it all Trevion Mccollum. These two teams are evenly matched stat wise but who will come away with the win and stay undefeated in the Mid-State conference. Havelock vs West Craven Game Preview: Quarterback Darius Abrams has proven he can be a dangerous one but will he have enough to knock Havelock off the top. Last year, Havelock simply destroyed West Craven 57-7. These are the two teams that remain undefeated in the Coastal 3A conference. Terry Sanford vs Lee County Game Preview: Terry Sanford is riding a four game winning streak, after shutting out Union Pines. Now they take on Lee County, a team that is 5-1 on the season. Christian Jayne has been getting it done at quarterback for Terry Sanford, along with the strong run game and solid defense. Lee County faced their first loss of the season but still continues to show that their defense is no joke but will need some more offensive power in this one if they want to stay unbeaten at home. Asheboro vs Ledford Game Preview: Ledford is riding a five game win streak behind a defense that has only allowed 43 points this season. Asheboro will be coming off a short week due to weather difficulties but has a talented roster with Division I talent. Asheboro took home the tough win 28-14 last year, but this could be the year for Ledford to get over the hump and make a statement in the 3A Mid-Piedmont conference.
