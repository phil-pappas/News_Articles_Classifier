Their 12-round fight for Jacobs' WBA middleweight title officially was announced Wednesday. It'll take place Dec. 5 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where both boxers live. Jacobs (30-1, 27 KOs) and Quillin (32-0-1, 23 KOs) have been friends for years, but this all-Brooklyn battle wasn't an opportunity either fighter wanted to pass up.\nJacobs, who resumed his career three years ago after beating cancer, has won 10 straight fights by knockout or TKO since Russia's Dmitry Pirog (20-0, 15 KOs) knocked him out in the fifth round of their July 2010 fight for Pirog's WBO middleweight championship. Quillin bounced back from an April 11 draw with WBO champ Andy Lee (34-2-1, 24 KOs) by knocking out Australia's Michael Zerafa (17-2, 9 KOs) in the fifth round Sept. 12 in Mashantucket, Conn.\nLOCAL LOOK: Paterson's Ian Green (7-0, 5 KOs) knocked out K'Lon Spencer (4-3, 3 KOs, 1 NC), of Beaumont, Texas, in the fourth round of a middleweight match Saturday night in Beach Haven. Paterson's Mike Mitchell (3-6-2, 1 KO) lost a four-round unanimous decision to light heavyweight prospect Meng Fanlong (2-0, 1 KO), a former Chinese Olympian who resides in Nutley, on the same card.\nTHE FINAL BELL: Deontay Wilder is good for boxing. He is charismatic, knocks people out and has developed a sizable fan base in his home state of Alabama, a market that wasn't previously exposed to high-profile fights.\nBut based on how Wilder looked during his knockout win against overmatched French contender Johann Duhaupas (32-3, 20 KOs) on Saturday night in Birmingham, it's tough to believe the WBC heavyweight champ will beat his mandatory challenger, former WBA title-holder Alexander Povetkin (29-1, 21 KOs), much less IBF/WBA/WBO champion Wladimir Klitschko (64-3, 53 KOs). Wilder (35-0, 34 KOs) gets hit too much, tires late in fights and Povetkin impressively has knocked out each of his three opponents since Klitschko outpointed him nearly two years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:32:46.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
