Storylines galore? Look at college QBs in state of Utah “ My intentions were not to have a staff member not be with us after a certain number of games. My intentions were to go the whole season with the same staff  and for that matter, seasons is what Ive tried to put together as continuity as a staff over time. At a personal level, thats really hard for me.”\nSUU head coach Ed Lamb\nCEDAR CITY — SUU football coach Ed Lamb was disappointed, but not too surprised when Gary Crowton informed him that he was resigning as the Thunderbirds' .\nThat’s because Crowton had previously hinted that his departure was imminent before stepping down from his position Monday afternoon.\n“At times during the season he spoke to different members of the staff about just what he felt was best for him and best for SUU,” Lamb said, during his weekly media session Tuesday night. “I kept encouraging him to stick around and keep things whole. Again, credit him, I think perhaps that right after the big victory (over Weber State) and a three-game winning streak, he thought now’s the time, now’s the time to allow somebody else a different opportunity and this is the only time to walk away without hurting this team.”\nCrowton resigned just three days after the T-Birds defeated their in-state rival 44-0. SUU improved to 3-2 with the win and 2-0 in the Big Sky Conference. He joined the T-Birds as the in 2014 after previous Steve Clark left for Weber State.\nThe mood within the players of team was one of surprise before Monday’s practice, which matched that of the coaches, Lamb said.\n“Personally, I feel that it’s a failure,” Lamb said. “My intentions were not to have a staff member not be with us after a certain number of games. My intentions were to go the whole season with the same staff — and for that matter, seasons is what I’ve tried to put together as continuity as a staff over time. At a personal level, that’s really hard for me.\n“This is not a situation where there were harsh words, where this was a departure that we were trying to cover up and make smooth, this is just a very experienced gentleman coach that felt the best thing for SUU was for him to step away and the best thing for him was to step away, and I don’t have other details as far as reasons go,” Lamb added. “That kind of gnaws at me. I told my staff that personally, it’s really disappointing. Professionally, I feel like we have great staff members and we have a great team and I couldn’t be more excited whether Gary Crowton was here or not. But personally, this is really difficult for me with all that he has meant for me and my career — all the mentorship he’s given me.”\nCrowton, who was the head coach at BYU from 2001 until 2004, will remain at SUU with a temporary role as a special advisor to athletic director Jason Butikofer, although what he will exactly be doing remains a mystery.\nBut with Crowton gone, Lamb will turn to Justin Walterscheid as his new onward. Walterscheid, who graduated from SUU in 2005, is in his fifth season on Lamb’s staff and was promoted from assistant and wide receivers coach.\n“It’s been pretty wild,” Walterscheid said. “I think the initial reaction, I was discouraged. I worked with Coach Crowton, enjoyed working with him. I’ve learned a ton from him, and he’s been a great mentor to me. On the flip side, because of that, I do feel confident and ready to go because I had a chance to learn from Coach Clark and Coach Crowton and been very close to the role.”\nLamb said Tuesday that he doesn’t expect Crowton is done with coaching and that he would leave the door open for Crowton’s return to the program, but he fully intends on keeping Walterscheid as his from here on out.\nThe new actually has previous experience heading into the job. Walterscheid was the offensive play caller for SUU in 2013 when it reached the FCS playoffs for the first time in program history.\n“I’m loyal with (Walterscheid) as I am to Gary Crowton and as open as my door is to him and SUU is to him, we now have a new guy sitting in that seat and it’s somebody that I trust,” Lamb said. “He was not the , but Steve Clark did a great job managing the staff and Steve felt that our best chance to win (in 2013) was to have Justin actually call the plays that Steve had coordinated and put together. So he’s got experience in doing it. Our players trust him, and I trust him.”\nDespite the midseason change, the T-Birds remain optimistic that it won’t change the offense as the T-Birds get further into conference play. The T-Birds have a bye week before taking on Sacramento State on Oct. 17.\n“I think Coach Crowton laid the foundation for what we’re going to do,” Walterscheid said. “There’s not a lot of changes that need to be made. I want us to concentrate on execution, not a different scheme — just being more detailed in everything we do.”\n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:17:26.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
