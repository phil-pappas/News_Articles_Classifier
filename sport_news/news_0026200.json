The band played the South Carolina alma mater before kickoff and stadium speakers blared electronic music hit \"Sandstorm\" as is standard practice in South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium. \nBillboards around town were programmed to read \"Geaux Gamecocks! Make yourself at home.\" \n\"Our flag's flying today, and our state flag is flying. They've played some music for us, our alma mater prior to the game,\" said South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner. \n\"So our thoughts and prayers are still with all of our friends and family in the state of South Carolina, but LSU certainly has rolled out the hospitality to the Nth degree to try to make sure we feel very comfortable and to give us a home game on the road, which is very difficult to do.\" \nCrowds were unusually sparse, with an entire upper deck on the east side of the stadium completely empty. There wasn't much traffic and plenty of parking. Attendance was just 42,058 in a venue that seats about 102,000. \nLSU planned to donate all revenues beyond expenses to South Carolina and Red Cross donation centers were set up outside Tiger Stadium. \nAs Thornton, wearing garnet Gamecocks gear, strolled past an LSU tailgate on campus he, his wife, Kristen, and their friend, Carrie Gilbert were greeted warmly by LSU fans wearing purple and gold. \n\"It's been great. We've had a blast. Everybody's offered us drinks, food,\" Gilbert said. \"They understand the flooding, obviously, because it was much more prevalent here with Katrina and other things in the past. There's been a lot of hospitality.\" \nJust outside the stadium stood George and Kim Durham of Abbeville, South Carolina, who also drove down. They had extra incentive. Their daughter, Kristy, is a graduate student at LSU. \n\"They've been treating us well. They've offered us food, drinks, and if we didn't have tickets they were going to give us tickets, but we bought some before we came down,\" George Durham said. \"It's like being a rock star, being out here today, but it's still kind of sad because so many people in South Carolina are hurting.\" \nMitchell Touchton, 18, is a South Carolina freshman who drove down with three other students. Classes were canceled last week because 34,000 students were too much for the city's damaged infrastructure to handle. \n\"The reception has been great. We walked past an LSU fraternity house and they were yelling Tiger Bait and we expected that,\" Touchton said. \"After that, every single tailgate we have passed has offered us food and drinks. It's been awesome.\" \nSouth Carolina planned to resume classes Monday, and Tanner said he was optimistic South Carolina would be able to host next week's game against Vanderbilt. But more rain was in the forecast Saturday. \n\"We've still got some breeches in some areas facing difficult times, so we'll assess it as we move forward,\" he said. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:52:28.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
