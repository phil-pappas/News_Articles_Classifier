Harimoto’s prize came after he beat 32-year-old Croatian Tan Ruiwu in a tight seven-game match in Warsaw on Thursday. “I won my group here, I’m happy because I won against Tan Ruiwu. If I attacked against him, everything was good but I had problem when I had to defend,” Harimoto, who started playing the game at the age of two, told the ITTF website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:57:55.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
