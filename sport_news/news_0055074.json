Wayne Rooney: Injuries won't hamper Manchester City in derbyStriker Wayne Rooney believes Manchester City still have the players to hurt rivals United on Sunday despite the absence of David Silva and Sergio Aguero.With home advantage and a shorter injury list than their rivals, United go into the 170th Manchester derby as slight favourites.Aguero has played a key part in City's recent run of six wins from their last eight derbies.The Argentinian has scored six goals in his last five matches against United but on Sunday Wilfried Bony is expected to lead the line for the visitors because Aguero has a hamstring injury. Bony has only scored twice this season but in Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling, City have two deadly players who United will have to keep a close eye on, according to Rooney.\"Nowadays the top teams have such good squads that they can cope with injuries,\" the United striker told United Review.\"The players they brought in cost over B#100million in De Bruyne and Sterling, so they are two fantastic young players and we have to nullify their threats and take advantage of their flaws.\"Raheem is a fantastic player and a great lad as well but he is still a young lad and still has a lot to learn. The good thing about Raheem is that he wants to learn.\"He has started his career at City really well but hopefully we can slow him down a bit on Sunday and come out on top.\"Having scored a record 11 goals in this fixture, Rooney's performance on Sunday could be decisive too.The United captain has been criticised for a lean return of two goals in eight league matches this season but continues to make significant achievements in the game.Rooney, who turned 30 on Saturday, became England's all-time leading goalscorer in September and after scoring in the 3-0 win over Everton last week he became the joint second highest scorer in Premier League history alongside Andy Cole.\"He was a great striker over the years for Newcastle and for United, which I think was the best time of his career,\" Rooney said of Cole.\"He was a natural goalscorer, he was great to watch and he was a big player for United.\"It's great to be alongside him now. I am still quite a long way off Alan Shearer; he has 260 goals and that one may be difficult to reach, but I am pleased to be second with Andy.\"Winger Ashley Young has returned to training after a calf injury but is not fit enough to play.Pablo Zabaleta feels City are heading into the derby with a spring in their step.City have enjoyed a superb week having thrashed Bournemouth 5-1 before coming from behind to beat Sevilla 2-1 in the Champions League with a last-gasp winner.Zabaleta is well aware of the importance of the derby to fans, having played in 14 of them since joining City in 2008, and thinks the Sevilla win gives them the perfect springboard.The Argentina defender, fit again after a recent knee injury, said: \"It was a massive win for confidence. Now hopefully we can put in a good performance on Sunday and win the game.\"Derbies are always special games. I have had the opportunity to play a lot of them since I have been here and I know it is a special game for the fans.\"It is a huge game, probably one of the greatest games you can watch in the Barclays Premier League, especially with both teams near the top of the league. They have a chance to beat us and go on top of the table and we have a chance to extend the gap.\"Now it is time to be focused on the game, forgetting about the Champions League - hopefully we did that job on Wednesday - and play a good game on Sunday.\"Boss Manuel Pellegrini's team selection will be eagerly anticipated as his refusal to confirm whether captain Vincent Kompany will feature has dominated the build-up from a City perspective.Kompany has been named on the bench for the two games played since Pellegrini voiced displeasure at his appearance for Belgium during the recent international break.The defender has been confirmed as fully fit but Pellegrini has given no guarantees the 29-year-old will return.
