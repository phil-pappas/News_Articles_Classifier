Or, if they do hand over a pink slip, they smooth things over with a golden parachute of taxpayer dollars.\nAs a result, it takes too long to get people to leave, and there are too many overly generous payouts.\nAfter dragging its feet for far too long and initially agreeing to a big golden parachute, the College of DuPage board on Tuesday fired former President Robert Breuder. No one should have been surprised when on Wednesday Breuder filed a lawsuit challenging his firing. Without commenting on each specific in that complaint — that would be the court’s job — the board had grounds for showing him the door.\nEDITORIAL\nFollow @csteditorials\nAt least the board, which has had its own internal problems, took a stand. Too often, Illinois institutions have simply paid huge sums to get top administrators to depart.\nLast year, former Illinois State University President Timothy Flanagan, who was found guilty of disorderly conduct after an altercation with university employees, got at least $480,418 to leave after serving just 10 months as president. In 2013, former Metra CEO Alex Clifford, who caught flak for challenging patronage hiring, got a $652,363 deal to pack up his bags. In August, former University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Chancellor Phyllis Wise, after violating email policy, was set to get a $400,000 payout to step down — on top of a tenured professorship at $300,000 a year. The offer was rescinded under pressure. Taxpayers can’t be happy that Breuder’s lawyer wants at least $2 million plus legal fees. But Breuder’s record at COD justifies the board’s decision on Tuesday to fire him five months before he was scheduled to retire early under pressure, along with a $763,000 golden parachute.\nAs the Chicago Tribune reported, Breuder spent millions of college money on a luxury restaurant with a high-end wine cellar, where he expensed hundreds of thousands of dollars. He built a boutique hotel that critics said served no educational purpose. Under Breuder, $243,305 spent on liquor was categorized as “instructional supplies,” and millions of dollars were doled out to companies connected to college insiders.\nEarlier this month, the Higher Learning Commission issued a scorching 45-page report that also cited unnecessary investment losses and a campus police academy college-credit scandal. Last year, the COD faculty union issued a no-confidence vote.\nSpringfield has taken some steps to limit abusive golden parachutes. A new law caps community-college severance payments and limits presidential employment contracts to four years. Another new law makes severance agreements public under the Freedom of Information Act.\nThat’s a start. But what’s really needed is some backbone for those who sit on boards anywhere — from the local parks up to the top universities.\nIf top administrators aren’t doing their jobs, they don’t deserve a pot of gold to leave early.\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: Follow @csteditorials\nTweets by @CSTeditorials", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/csteditorials", "https://twitter.com/CSTeditorials"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:49:18.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
