What really made the 23-year-old Argentine light up was one thought: He’s going to the Masters. \n“It means everything,” Grillo said. “They’ve said the word ‘Masters’ twice today. You see this?” \nHe pointed to a smile that was brighter than the silver trophy sitting next to him on the table. \nGrillo made a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-5 18th in regulation for a 3-under 69 to post at 15-under 273. Na got up-and-down from right of the 18th green and made birdie from 6 feet for a 70 to force a playoff. \nThe Argentine looked like a sure winner until missing the 3-footer, which brought back such dark memories of Puerto Rico he said he had nightmares for a week. \nThe next mistake belonged to Na. \nFrom the 18th fairway on the second extra hole, he tried to hit driver off the deck and hooked it behind a tree, which made it difficult for him to keep his third shot on the green. Na made bogey, and Grillo only had to two-putt for the victory. \nNa said he has been hitting driver off the tight fairway grass all week without any trouble. He told Golf Channel right after it was over that maybe the darkening sky or the ball slightly above his feet caused him to hook it. Na, who earned $648,000, declined to come to the media room to speak to reporters. \nGrillo sure had a debut to remember. \nOn Saturday, he didn’t realize the group was still on the green at the reachable 17th hole and his tee shot narrowly hit Rory McIlroy on the fly. \n“I didn’t want to be the guy who almost hit Rory McIlroy this week,” Grillo said. “Kind of wanted to have this trophy and everybody know me because I have the trophy, and not because I almost hit him.” \nAlong with the trophy, he added to what is already known as the “Class of 2011” — a high school graduating class that includes Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schniederjans and Daniel Berger, who was voted PGA Tour rookie of the year. \nSpieth tweeted out his name and added “first of many wins! Cool seeing the 11s always playing great.” ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:30:49.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
