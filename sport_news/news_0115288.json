He wound up playing only 13 snaps. \nThree other players who didn't participate in Wednesday's practice were full participants on Thursday: starting cornerback Adam Jones, who had a groin injury; wide receiver Brandon Tate, who was ill and offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth, who was given a veteran's day off. \nFour players who were limited participants in Wednesday's practice were full participants on Thursday: wide receiver Marvin Jones (foot); cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick (hip); offensive tackle Andre Smith (elbow) and guard Kevin Zeitler (elbow). \nPhoto: Tony Tribble for Local.12 \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
