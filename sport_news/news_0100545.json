The Bulls remain optimistic Rose will play in their Oct. 27 season opener against the Cavaliers.\n“We don't know how long it'll take for him to get back into playing shape,” Hoiberg said after the first of two Thursday practices. “Once everything heals up in these first couple weeks, he should be able to resume full activity. So that'll give him a couple weeks to prepare and get himself ready.”\nHoiberg acknowledged the difficulty of losing two weeks of training camp from a conditioning standpoint.\n“You'd be surprised how quickly it does go,” he said. “It's just about getting his timing back. You don't want to throw him into scrimmaging that first day, got to get his legs back underneath him. So that'll take a few days. But again, hopefully, with everything involved, having the two weeks completely off so his eye can heal, he'll get it back quick because he is in great shape right now.”\nHoiberg is hopeful Rose will be cleared to attend practice after his follow-up exam so he can observe because “we’re adding new stuff every day.”\nPrivacy Policy Derrick Rose Chicago Bulls", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d7619/turbine/ct-bulls-derrick-rose-injury-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-01T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:02:24.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
