The Raiders (3-1 Frontier), who have been off since establishing a school record for points in an 82-9 win over Montana State-Northern on Sept. 26, are part of a four-way tie for first place. Saturday's opponent, 16th-ranked Montana Western (3-1), is one of those first-place parties. So is No. 4 Carroll (3-1), which will visit Raider Stadium on Oct. 17 in a rematch of the season opener. Carroll forced the deadlock (which also pushed No. 17 Montana Tech into the mix) two weeks ago by stealing a 10-9 decision at Montana Western, in which the only touchdown of the game was Carroll's go-ahead score four minutes into the second half. It stood as the final score of the game, as the Bulldogs produced 390 yards of offense (136 more than the Saints) but failed on 14 of 18 third-down conversions. The scene that day in Dillon, Mont., was a little different than the one in Ashland, where the Raiders manufactured 12 touchdown drives and needed less than a minute to find the end zone on eight of them. Montana Western boasts the top-ranked defense in the NAIA in terms of points allowed per game (nine) and SOU has the sixth-best offense in terms of points scored (45.5), meaning the teams will likely meet somewhere in the middle at Vigilante Field. Kickoff is set for noon PDT. NAIA TOP 25: For the second week in a row, SOU was ranked No. 2 Monday in the fourth Top 25 poll of the regular season. Top-ranked Lindsey Wilson (Ky.), one of six undefeated teams, received 13 of the 15 first-place votes (SOU and No. 3 Morningside, Iowa, got the others), but the Blue Raiders have earned their four wins against teams with a combined record of 1-19. Three other Frontier teams benefited from the conference-wide bye, all moving up one spot each: No. 4 Carroll, No. 16 Montana Western and No. 17 Montana Tech. Rocky Mountain is one of four unranked teams receiving votes and has a chance to push its way into the rankings as it hosts Montana Tech this week. QUICK HITS: — This will be the first time the Raiders have faced a ranked Frontier opponent on the road other than Carroll since their third-ever Frontier contest - a 48-45 double-overtime loss at Montana Tech on Sept. 29, 2012. — SOU has a 5-1 all-time mark against the Bulldogs, including a 4-1 record in conference meetings and a 1-1 mark in Dillon. The Raiders won last year's matchup, 31-6, on Oct. 11 at Raider Stadium. In terms of points allowed, that matched SOU's best defensive effort in its last 123 outings. — Kamerun Smith and Tanner Trosin combined for seven TD passes against MSU-Northern after SOU didn't record any over its first three games. Since his 2-for-5 debut, Trosin has completed 38 of 54 attempts (70.4 percent) with 475 passing yards and 226 rushing. — Melvin Mason's 110-yard effort (on eight rushes) was the seventh 100-yard game of his career and second of the season. He's one of four Raiders with at least 10 attempts averaging over six yards per carry. — Matt Retzlaff's two receiving TDs gave him 23 scores through the air for his career. He's one behind his brother, Ryan, who ranks fifth in school history in TD receptions. — A different player has led the Raiders in tackles every game. Julius Rucker (29), Tyson Cooper (27) and Joseph Lealofi (24) lead the team overall, and Cooper's 2.5 sacks lead eight players with at least one. — The Raider defense is giving up 367.8 yards per game. Their opponents haven't finished with an average lower than 430 since the 2010 season, when the Raiders were only putting up 310 yards themselves. — Thomas Giddens ranks third in the NAIA at 46.6 yards per punt. — SOU has been the second-most penalized team in the NAIA at 118.8 yards per game. — With an all-time program record of 352-352-15, SOU is at the .500-mark for the first time in 10 years. MONTANA WESTERN: The Bulldogs started the 2014 by losing five of their first seven. Their game at SOU marked the last of those losses, and since then they've won seven of eight. Junior running back Sam Rutherford — who burned the Raiders for 185 yards on 11 carries in UMW's 38-34 upset of visiting SOU on Sept. 7, 2013 — is the team's top offensive threat at 92.3 rushing yards per game, including 185 on 29 carries in the loss to Carroll. The passing game has been less impressive with two freshmen running the show. Starter JD Ferris is completing 43 percent of his attempts with five interceptions — he went 9-for-26 with 93 yards against Carroll — while his backup, Bradley Smith, is 19-for-35 with 29 of those attempts occurring against MSU-Northern. Defensively, the Bulldogs have yielded just 57 first downs (second in the NAIA) and 277 yards per game (seventh). It features two All-Frontier linebackers in AJ Wilson (26 tackles, four interceptions) and Joe Coker (22 tackles), and Reno Ward has been a force on the defensive line with team-highs of 29 tackles and five sacks.
