After each play, he’d mark the down and distance and note what stood out to him on both sides of the ball. He’d turn to the player next to him, pointing out responsibilities on each snap and what he thought should be done in certain situations. It was just like preparing for any other game. But the future Hall of Fame coach wasn’t breaking down film of the Patriots’ next opponent. Instead, he was watching film of high-school students, particularly games involving The Rivers School in Weston, with his oldest son, Steve Belichick. “We’d talk about some keys that the other team would have. Like formation or various other tendencies — stances and splits and things like that,” Bill Belichick said. Every week during the season, the then-Rivers School coach Darren Sullivan would send Steve home with game film and eagerly await the results. “He and his dad would go and watch the previous game’s film together,” Sullivan said. “We would give him copies and they would sit down together and break it down. Stevie would go over it with his dad, come back and have some ideas about the next week’s opponent and that kind of thing. He would also watch film on his own.” Bill Belichick was 10 years old when his father, also named Steve, would have him break down film of Navy opponents. The elder Belichick revolutionized football scouting similar to the way his son would revolutionize coaching and game planning. As they say, like father like son. Learning how to break down film has long been a rite of passage in the family. Bill Belichick taught his son about formations and plays when Steve was in elementary school. His childhood also included trading cards and playing Madden NFL, but when his father was involved, it was all used as a tool for teaching the game. “I mean, we’ve kind of been talking football back to football cards. Occasionally a video game and stuff like that, since he was in the single digits for sure,” Bill Belichick said. “But he’s kind of done that his whole life.” Now 28 years old and in his fourth season as a coaching assistant with the Patriots, Steve Belichick continues to follow in his father’s legendary footsteps. **** THE GRIDIRON was his playground. Steve Belichick was 4 years old when his father took his first head coaching job in Cleveland. He was 13 when Bill Belichick was hired as head coach of the Patriots in 2000. As he grew up, he watched, listened and learned — like his father did when he was a boy — and spent summers at training camp. “He’s grown up around the facility, around the players, around the team,” Bill Belichick said. “He’s seen it from a coaching end as well as player end when he played in high school and college.” Like his father, Steve Belichick played lacrosse and football in college. And, like his father, he was known more for his IQ than his athletic ability. When people noticed his last name on a jersey or a roster, lofty expectations followed. He had to live up to the challenge in high school and later at Rutgers. He impressed various coaches and peers along the way. You won’t find many backup long snappers breaking down film in college football. You probably won’t find many future NFL draft picks going to these long snappers for advice, either. But that’s what happened during Rutgers’ 2011 season. After playing lacrosse for the Scarlet Knights for four seasons, Steve Belichick walked on to the Rutgers football team. On a team that featured eight future NFL draft picks, he helped defensive players break down film, just like his father had shown him. Among those who he helped were future Patriots Logan Ryan and Duron Harmon. “He did his job as the backup long snapper, but he was also like an assistant coach–esque,\" Ryan said. \"That’s where he showed off a little bit of his coaching skills. He showed us how to break down some film and showed us how to use that stuff years ago. He was a huge help.” “He was helping me in college getting ready for games,” Harmon added. “He would tell me what he saw from their offenses, what I can be on queue for, what I should try to remember. You could tell that he was going to be a coach in college. You could already tell.” Scarlet Knights head coach Greg Schiano would give Belichick “projects”— like running the scout team, watching tape or putting together film clips. Bill Belichick called it “a great experience” that also turned out to be advantageous for the Patriots. “I’m sure that he learned a lot through coach Schiano as I have through all my conversations with coach Schiano,” Bill Belichick said. “And just the way he ran the team and things he did to prepare the team and so forth. Stephen and I have talked about those things as well. I’ve got some good ideas from some of the things that they did at Rutgers.” **** PART OF BEING a Belichick is the ability to stay composed. It’s about taking a deep breath, staring across the sideline and having the confidence that you can outmaneuver the opposing coach. It’s one of the things that’s made Bill Belichick great. Sometimes it’s also about taking a deep breath and blocking out the noise. Steve Belichick learned that early. There were many times during Rutgers lacrosse road games that he heard it. Opposing fans tossed insults his way about the Patriots and his father. “Every time we went on the road or Bill was at a game, everyone knew who Stephen was. He’d hear it from the stands,” former Rutgers lacrosse coach Jim Stagnitta said. “There’d be hoots and hollers all the time. That just never really bothered him. When you spend time with him, as you do with his dad, you learn he doesn’t get rattled very easily. They’re very steady when it comes to that.” Steve Belichick also dealt with trash-talking spectators in high school. But it wasn’t fellow teenagers he had to worry about. It was the parents in the stands who behaved the worst, taunting the teenager. “Surprisingly not with the kids. More so with the parents,” Sullivan said. “But he was pretty stoic and handled it very, very well. I don’t recall any times where he lashed out. He just handled it.” Sullivan, who also taught Steve Belichick in his modern world history and U.S. history classes, saw a young man who embraced his name and legacy. At The Rivers School, he’d often be seen wearing his grandfather’s dog tags. On the field, he embodied a selfless, emotional leader as a senior captain, one who offered to sit out his final high-school game to give playing time to other seniors. “I’m not surprised he’s a coach, let’s put it that way,” Sullivan said. The respect he garnered from teammates in high school and college carried over to Gillette Stadium. And this isn’t a story about being nice to your head coach’s son. Bill Belichick casts a large shadow, but Steve Belichick’s worked hard to create his own identity. “I think Steve’s not necessarily trying to allow himself to be put under that umbrella,” said Brendan Daly, the Patriots defensive line coach. “He’s trying to do his own thing. He’s working hard at the craft, get better every day and develop himself as a coach. It’s fun to see.” **** ASK BILL BELICHICK about working with his son and he’ll smile and tell you it’s “awesome.” Seeing Steve grow as a coach has been special. It also brings him back to when he was in his 20s, trying to make a name for himself. He first cut his teeth as a special assistant with the Baltimore Colts in 1975, a year out of college. His father’s connection with Colts’ special-teams coach George Boutselis earned him the opportunity, but it was up to the young coach to make the most of it. With each season, Bill Belichick was given more responsibility. He remembers what it was like to gradually gain trust from coaches and players around him. “It’s great to see him on a daily basis and to see him grow and develop as a coach,” Bill Belichick said. “I certainly think back to my time at that age and what that meant to me, each day, each week, each game, because you don’t have very many of them at that point. Each year, how much growth and knowledge you absorb. And then being able to put it into application, you know, the second, third time around after you’ve gotten it.” Steve Belichick started to rise through the ranks long before he joined the Patriots in 2012. When his father was hired, he started out in training camp as a ball boy. During the summers throughout high school and college, he progressively did more, working in the scouting department and taking on more “projects.” In practice he's glued to linebackers coach Patrick Graham, but it’s behind the scenes where he’s making a name for himself. This offseason, the Patriots had him work out players before the draft. One of those was third-round pick Geneo Grissom, the defensive lineman from Oklahoma. “At first glance, I was like, ‘Dang, he’s young. He’s really young,’” Grissom said. But the two hit it off. Young players often turn to Steve Belichick to learn the ropes inside Gillette Stadium. He teaches them how to study, watch tape and about the terminology. “He has a great understanding of the game. He’s really relatable,” Grissom said. “He’s really great with players like myself or in my position, rookies. Being able to just kind of help us and guide us through on this process.” He’s also “progressively” taken over the defensive scout team. Inside the building, he handles paperwork for defensive coordinator Matt Patricia, writing up scouting reports. Like he did in high school and college, he studies film. He’ll break down plays from opposing teams and put together highlight packages for the coaches and players. “Instead of somebody telling him, ‘Put these plays together on a tape,’ now he can go to the tape, find the plays that we need and use them and create them himself and say, ‘Hey, I did this. What do you think of it?’” Bill Belichick said. “That’s where he’s really thinking ahead for you. It’s great to see that and great to be able to experience it first-hand with him.” The Patriots head coach wouldn’t say whether he thinks his son will become a head coach. “I don’t know. At this point, when I was at that point in my career, that wasn’t ever something I really thought about,” said Bill Belichick, who was just beginning to climb the coaching ladder with the New York Giants when he was the age his son is now. “I just thought about trying to do a good job for the team that I was with, whether that was the Lions or the Giants or whoever it was. I think he’s kind of in that same mindset. “He’s unselfish. He works hard. He does whatever he can do to help our team. I think that’s the most important thing to him rather than worrying about where he’s going to be 15 years from now. I don’t think that’s really too high on the radar.” One day at a time. Steve Belichick’s a chip off the old block. By Mark Daniels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:48:38.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
