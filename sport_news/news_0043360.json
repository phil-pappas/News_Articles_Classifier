There was no scoring in the second half. \nOceanside tallied 13 points in the first quarter and 22 in the second, while Hermon compiled eight points in the second stanza. \nA link to more photos from the game will appear later with this story. \nSee more photos and video below. \nNorton's touchdowns came on a 10-yard fumble return, 79-yard run and a 46-yard reception. He finished with 91 yards rushing on five carries and 46 yards receiving. \nRaye had 203 yards rushing and two TDs. Raye scored on a 75-yard run to open the scoring for the Mariners, caught a 15-yard scoring pass from Brandon DeBrosky and scored on a two-point conversion rush to put the Mariners ahead 21-0. \nNick Page had a 5-yard TD run for the winless Hawks (0-6) and finished with 69 yards on 12 carries. Garrett Trask added 54 yards on 21 carries for the Hawks. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Crabtree Points for Class C North, Oceanside (3-3) is sixth, while Winslow (6-0, 136.9565 points) is first in the 10-team region. The top eight squads qualify for the playoffs. \nThe Mariners' win over Hermon is not included in the standings, thus Oceanside may be ranked higher then sixth. \nAmong the pregame ceremonies Friday night was a large photo of former Rockland Tiger football quarterback Dylan Meklin, 23, recently lost at sea with other crew members when the cargo ship El Faro sank near the Crooked Islands in the Bahamas during Hurricane Joaquin, held by Oceanside players as balloons were released in Meklin's memory. \nOceanside players also wore stick-on anchors on their helmets that read, \"Meklin Strong\" and there was a moment of silence for him and others involved in the tragedy. \nDoug Curtis, Oceanside's statistician, provided information for this story.
