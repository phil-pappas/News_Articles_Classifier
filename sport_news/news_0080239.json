The 2001 Yankees also did it against Oakland, and the 2012 Giants did it against Cincinnati. Both of those teams went on to reach the World Series.\nMost Read Stories Seattle Seahawks release WR B.J.

Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay.\nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making errors on three straight ground balls, and Toronto rallied. Benches cleared twice in the Blue Jays’ half of the inning.\nRoberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save.\nOsuna turned toward the outfield after striking out Wil Venable, looked to the sky and was mobbed by his teammates as jubilant fans rocked the Rogers Centre.\nAfter Edwin Encarnacion tied it 2-all with a second-deck drive off tough-luck loser Cole Hamels in the sixth, Odor led off the seventh with a single and went to third on a sacrifice and ground out.\nWith Choo up, Martin’s throw back to reliever Aaron Sanchez deflected off Choo and dribbled toward third base. Home-plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned the call, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home.\n“It’s never happened in my life before,” Martin said. “It’s just one of those moments, and it created an opportunity for us to do something special.”\nScott acknowledged making a mistake with his initial ruling.\n“I was mixing up two rules,” Scott said. “If there’s no intent, if he’s not out of the box, that throw is live.”\nThe Rangers made three consecutive errors to start the bottom half, two by shortstop Elvis Andrus.\nAfter Sam Dyson relieved Hamels, Josh Donaldson tied it at 3 with a flare just beyond the reach of Odor at second.\nBautista followed with a towering drive into the second deck, glaring at Dyson as he stood at home plate to admire his go-ahead drive, enthusiastically flipping his bat away.\nWith some fans continuing to litter the field, Encarnacion turned to face the crowd and appealed for calm, lifting his bat and helmet over his head. Dyson took exception and walked over to confront Encarnacion, leading to both dugouts and both bullpens emptying.\n“I told him Jose needs to calm down, respect the game a little more,” Dyson said.\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:00:12.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
