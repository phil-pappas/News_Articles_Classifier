Teddy Greenstein Contact Reporter Of Iowa and Northwestern, one has a formula for winning. And it isn't the Wildcats. \nQuarterback C.J. Beathard is the player who \"embodies\" this Iowa team. Coach Kirk Ferentz said that, but Iowa fans already knew it. \nA backup on last year's snoozy 7-6 squad, Beathard represents the brains, moxie and — oh, yeah — fun of a 7-0 team that clobbered Northwestern 40-10 on Saturday at Ryan Field. \nAnd the play that embodied the blowout came in the fourth quarter on third-and-5. Beathard wanted to make a quick flip to Derrick Mitchell, but some Northwestern defenders were in the way. So Beathard waited and waited and waited some more until Mitchell finally got free. \n\"It wasn't designed like that,\" Beathard said. \nMitchell snatched Beathard's lob and went 23 yards. \n\"Sometimes I think to myself: How does he make those plays?\" receiver Tevaun Smith said. \"I'm a fan out there too. He's a winner.\" \nAll the action from Ryan Field. \nFerentz joked about wanting to take credit for the play, knowing he couldn't. \nThen, alluding to how Beathard spent much of the game limping on what's believed to be a sore hip and groin, Ferentz dropped a reference only your grandfather would understand. \n\"He was walking like Amos McCoy,\" Ferentz said to a room of blank faces. \"You guys gotta look that up.\" \nThat would be \"Grandpa\" Amos McCoy, whom Walter Brennan played on \"The Real McCoys,\" a sitcom that aired from 1957 to '63. \nBottom line on Beathard, Ferentz said: \"That was just pure guts today on his part.\" \nOne day, perhaps, redshirt freshman Northwestern quarterback Clayton Thorson will play with the same kind of savvy and efficiency. Maybe he will have receivers who can catch the ball. Maybe he will play for a coordinator who asks Justin Jackson to carry it more than 10 times, as he did Saturday. \nWhereas Iowa has its formula for victories — Saturday's rushing hero was third-stringer Akrum Wadley, who scored four times and churned out 204 yards — the Wildcats are a pass-happy team that can't pass. Their 43 attempts netted 147 yards, three sacks and an off-the-back-foot fling from Thorson that Desmond King easily intercepted. \nThe Wildcats wore black 1995 throwback jerseys but did not resemble the group that went to the Rose Bowl. \nRemember when Iowa-Northwestern games were competitive? The Hawkeyes have outscored the Wildcats 88-17 the last two years. \nSaturday's \"effort\" was marked by dropped passes, dumb penalties, really dumb penalties, missed tackles, extremely curious play-calling and a flubbed/fumbled handoff. \nThe motto of the '95 team was \"Expect victory.\" \nThe motto of this team should be \"Expect more.\" \nIf these Wildcats were good enough to drub a Stanford team that has dominated every other opponent on its schedule, then there's no excuse for being this bad in back-to-back games. \nLast week it was Michigan. Saturday it was an Iowa team that can book reservations for the Big Ten title game. \nIowa has beaten Wisconsin and Illinois and has this cozy slate left: Maryland, at Indiana, Minnesota, Purdue, at Nebraska. \n\"How good we are, I have no idea,\" Ferentz said. \"But I do know this: This team plays extremely hard and has a lot of guts.\" \nFerentz, wild and crazy guy that he is — look that up, kids — said he would extend the team's 24-hour rule for celebrating. \n\"They have earned it,\" he said of a banged-up group whose shuffled offensive line helped the Hawkeyes to a 294-51 advantage in rushing yards. \nThey also earned the crown jewel of an open date, which Beathard will use to get his legs back. \n\"Couldn't be a better time for a bye week,\" Beathard said, \"that's for sure.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:02:05.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
