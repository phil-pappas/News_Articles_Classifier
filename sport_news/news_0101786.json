Bradshaw, who suffered a broken leg in that game that ended his season, was re-signed by the Colts on Wednesday. They host the Patriots on Sunday. Posted: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 7:40 pm Colts re-sign Bradshaw, hope for Luck return By George Bremer | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 14, 2015 \nINDIANAPOLIS — The Colts will have one returning familiar face available in the offensive backfield Sunday night against the Patriots. \nAnd they're hopeful for another. \nIndianapolis re-signed veteran running back Ahmad Bradshaw on Wednesday, putting a horseshoe on the side of his helmet for the third consecutive season. Bradshaw's season ended last November when he broke his leg in a Sunday night loss against New England. \nHe visited the Colts' facility last week as a season long free agent after posting solid numbers in 10 games last year. Bradshaw averaged 4.7 yards per carry, rushed for 425 yards, had 300 yards receiving and scored eight touchdowns, six on pass receptions. \n\"He's a warrior,\" Pagano said after last week's visit became public. \"I think everybody in this room and everybody in our locker room and this organization knew what he did for our football team and what kind of toughness and energy and passion that he brings. He's one heck of a ballplayer.\" \nTo make room for Bradshaw, Indianapolis placed rookie running back Tyler Varga on injured reserve. The 22-year-old Yale graduate missed the past two games with a concussion. \nBradshaw will join rookie Josh Robinson and second-year back Zurlon Tipton on the depth chart behind starter Frank Gore, who rushed for 98 yards and one touchdown in last week's 27-20 win at Houston. \nThe Colts would like to reintroduce quarterback Andrew Luck to the mix as well. The fourth-year passer threw publicly at practice Wednesday for the first time in two weeks, but he again was limited in practice and still is listed as day-to-day. \n\"He looked good,\" Pagano said. \"Throws were good, good command out there like usual. Again, he's heading in the right direction. I hate to sound like a broken record, but I don't know what else to tell you guys.\" \nLuck struggled through most of the first three weeks — tossing five touchdowns and seven interceptions — before leading a wild come-from-behind victory in the fourth quarter at Tennessee. He was 11-of-13 for 144 yards and two touchdowns as Indianapolis rallied for a 35-33 win but has not played since. \nThe Colts held out hope he would be able to play in subsequent victories against the Jaguars and Texans, but he was a game-day scratch on both occasions. \nLuck feels as though he's on the right track and felt as though he took the next step in his progression Wednesday. \n\"I think we're constantly self-evaluating each other,\" he said. \"I think that's the nature of being an athlete. Am I better than I was yesterday or am I worse? Did I do this better, or did I do that better? That's certainly a part of the whole process, and I like to think I'm getting better every day and pretty darn close to where I want to be.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:57:29.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
