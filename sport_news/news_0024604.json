Brock is currently nursing a high ankle sprain Posted: Saturday, October 17, 2015 9:45 am Injuries can't slow Pawnee Black Bears By Kieran Steckley/Stillwater News Press stwnewspress.com Posted on Oct 17, 2015 by Kieran Steckley \nThe Pawnee Black Bears were depleted, but never down. \nPawnee coach Russell Cook wasn’t sure how much he would get out of quarterback Nathan Brock and wide receiver Caylan Biddy, both seniors who account for more than 90 percent of Pawnee’s offense and an unmeasurable amount of leadership. \nNeither were 100 percent healthy. Brock is still recovering from a high ankle sprain suffered a few weeks ago and Biddy is dealing with a hamstring injury. Both played and both played both ways in helping the Black Bears beat Newkirk, 44-30. \n“He is a hard-nosed kid, a leader of this team and our team does better things when he is in there,” Cook said of Brock. “He showed a lot heart coming back even though he wasn’t 100 percent.” \nPawnee (5-2, 2-1) is right in the hunt for a playoff berth out of District 2A-1. And if it gets there, Brock will be a big reason why. \n“He just gets our team going,” Cook said. “He shows great leadership not only on the football field, but in our community. He is valedictorian of his class. He is a kid that everybody in our school knows and likes. He has a great personality. He is a good Christian kid, overall. Our community is thankful that we have a kid like that in our system.” \nBiddy, who had been held out of practice to nurse that injured hamstring and was a game-time , scored two touchdowns, one of which put the game away late in fourth quarter. \n“Those two kids showed a lot of heart and leadership to go out and get a win,” Cook said. \nPawnee was up 30-6 in the fourth quarter and looked to coast its way to a victory, but Newkirk had other plans. \nNewkirk started a comeback and forced Cook to keep his injured stars in the game longer. \n“Newkirk never did give up. They took it to us down to the last wire. For them to come back like that shows a lot about Newkirk’s kids. \n“They gave our kids a good lesson, too, about going out, finishing the game and making sure you play well until the end.” \nThe Black Bears travel to Chisholm next week to face what is considered to be the best team in District 2A-1. Chisholm has outscored opponents 328-18 this season. \nCook went to college with Chisholm coach Joey Reinart. They are friends and very familiar with each other’s philosophy. \n“Our offense is a little rusty and obviously our defense still needs some work, so we are going into this next game against Chisholm as a learning week,” Cook said. “We will go in and maintain health and try to get a win. Chisholm is probably the best team in our district.” \nPerkins-Tryon gets back in win column \nThe Demons worked all week to put their lopsided loss against Heritage Hall behind them. \nThey did just that Thursday night. \nP-T scored a road victory with a 42-7 win at Mannford. \n“We played really good defense, controlled the ball on offense, ran the ball pretty effectively and no turnovers,” Demons coach Bruce Williams said. “A real solid game.” \nThe Demons (4-4, 2-2) relied on senior running back Chrys Bell for lead their run game. Quarterback Autry Westfall, who made his return after missing three games due to injury, carried the ball 13 times and had more than 100 yards rushing. \n“He looked like he missed several weeks,” Williams said of his quarterback. “He wasn’t quite as sharp on his passing game, but he played well.” \nLast week, the talk was for the Demons to look forward and not dwell on the loss. They players got the message. \n“It’s always good to get back in the win column at any point of time,” Williams said. “I think our kids understand where we are at compared to a team like Heritage Hall. They are an elite team. We feel pretty good about having short-term memory and focusing on the loss as much as working on winning the next game.” \nThe Demons host Kingfisher (3-4, 2-1) next week in a district matchup. \n“We have to keep getting better,” Williams said. “We have to play good football. If we play as well as we played last night, we’ll have a chance to win. But it is going to take that type of performance to give us a chance.” \nMorrison responds in second half to beat Barnsdall \nThings were looking bleak for the Wildcats after one half of football being played at Barnsdall. \nMorrison could not manage to get a first down in the opening half and were losing 6-0 going into the break. \nThat was probably the first time in 21 years that I ever experienced that,” Morrison coach Cory Bales said. \nBut things turned around and Morrison pulled away to a 24-6 victory. \n“We changed changed up formation-wise and was able to start moving the ball,” Bales said. \nHighlights included running back Beau Veit breaking a 42-yard run, a Tristan Garringer 30-yard touchdown run and a few defensive stops. Veit scored again to put the game away late. \n“It was quite a football game,” Bales said. “The most pleasing thing about it was being down 6-0 and not getting a first down the entire first half and coming out and scoring on three possessions in the second half was really good to see from our kids.” \nBales said he was proud of how he kids responded to the frustrating first half. \n“Their heads are spinning, my head is spinning,” Bales said. “It was very impressive on their part. On defense, we gave up about four or five first downs in the second half. They played really solid throughout the game.” \nGarringer is still handling quarterback duties for the Wildcats as starter Jordan Quinata is still recovering from an injury suffered early in the season, but there is hope Quinata could be closer to a return. \n“It wouldn’t surprise me if he sees some action this Friday,” Bales said. \nFollow Kieran Steckley on Twitter @Kieran_Steckley for updates on area high school football.
