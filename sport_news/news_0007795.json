MONTREAL – Like a good referee, the Rangers’ penalty kill is often easy to overlook because it does its job so well. Unfortunately, high turnover in personnel has seen Brian Boyle sign in Tampa Bay, Carl Hagelin traded to Anaheim, and a less familiar mix of forwards now faces the difficult task to gel and match expectations.\nDominic Moore remains the leader on Alain Vigneault’s shorthanded unit, with the same stout defense and Henrik Lundqvist in net. But it is worth pointing out – after the Blueshirts (3-1-0) surrendered two power play goals in Tuesday night’s 4-1 home loss to the Winnipeg Jets – that this year’s penalty kill is more of a work in progress than this team or coaching staff is used to.\nImproving on special teams was one of the focuses of Wednesday afternoon’s practice in Greenburgh, before the Rangers flew north to face the undefeated Montreal Canadiens (4-0-0) on Thursday night at Bell Centre.\n“We made a couple bad reads (on the penalty kill Tuesday night) that gave the (Jets) some Grade-A looks,” Vigneault said Monday. “(They were) reads that we normally make a little bit quicker to take those options away, which we didn’t do.”\nJarret Stoll, Viktor Stalberg and Oscar Lindberg are three forwards featured prominently on the kill this season that weren’t even on the team last year. All three, and Moore, were on ice for a Jets power play goal Tuesday night. Tanner Glass and Jesper Fast are returning starters but aren’t difference-makers in the mold of Boyle or Hagelin.\nStalberg, signed to a one-year deal, has not killed penalties often in his career, but he is a big body that can skate, so the Rangers told him they expected shorthanded contributions. He has started the season encouragingly with three assists in four games, but Tuesday night he lost his lane prior to Winnipeg rookie Nikolaj Ehlers’ power play finish.\n“The first goal I probably have got to get the puck back off the draw,” Stalberg said. “Other than that, I’ve felt pretty good, and it’s helping me stay in games (to play on the kill). “\nThe Rangers’ penalty kill is now 12-for-16 (75%) through four games, but the 3-for-5 night against Winnipeg must remain an anomaly. Last regular season, the Rangers allowed more than one power play goal in just five of 82 games, and only once in their final 61 matches.\nThat’s proof that sometimes it just takes a while for new faces to form chemistry. Vigneault, though, appeared ready to put Fast and Emerson Etem into Thursday night’s lineup, not only to shake up a lackluster fourth line but perhaps to strengthen his shorthanded unit, too. Etem, acquired in the Hagelin trade, would be making his season debut if he dresses. He kills penalties, as well.\nBOYLE IT DOWN\nHenrik Lundqvist will make his fifth straight start to open the season against the Habs. Veteran defenseman Dan Boyle also will return to the lineup after his first healthy scratch in one-plus years as a Ranger.\n“He’s been in the league a long time,” Vigneault said of Boyle. “At this time, in year two with our team, he should understand how we want to play and how we need to play to be successful. He’s a smart player. He needs to go out and execute the way that he can and the way that we anticipate for him to execute. He’s a good player, and he’s gonna get another opportunity.”\nCUP CRAZY\nGoldin Auction is selling the Madison Square Garden rink that the Rangers skated on from 1991 through 2013, also known as the surface on which the 1994 Rangers captured Lord Stanley’s Cup.\nThe auction goes live Oct. 19, and the opening bid will be $50,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:24:41.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
