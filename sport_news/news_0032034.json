CHICAGO – Yes, Daniel Murphy is getting the most postseason buzz among big-name Mets who are free agents after the season and it’s only right, considering his crazy homer streak.\nBut Yoenis Cespedes, who has been only so-so thus far in the playoffs, perhaps offered a reminder Tuesday night that he’ll get an even bigger contract than Murphy after the season. Heck, maybe his performance even ratchets up the pressure on the Mets to re-sign the slugger who helped reshape their season after he was acquired from Detroit.\nIn a 5-2 victory over the Cubs in Game 3 of the NLCS, Cespedes showcased his talents, flashing most everything but his rocket throwing arm: legs, muscle, hitting prowess.\nCespedes knocked in the Mets’ first run by doubling in David Wright in the first inning, was robbed of another extra-base hit on a deep fly to center in the third, stole a key base in the sixth and bolted home on a wild pitch to score the run that put the Mets ahead for good. In the seventh, he hit a ball that Kyle Schwarber couldn’t catch in left field and was awarded a single that drove in an insurance run.\nIt all added up to a big night for a guy who had been mostly a playoff disappointment for the Mets. He has two home runs, but La Potencia had struck out 10 times in 28 playoff at-bats entering Game 3 and was hitting only .214. After going 3-for-5 Tuesday night, he’s batting .273 in the postseason.\n“I think every player goes through some rough patches and obviously I’ve had some rough patches in the previous games,” Cespedes said through a translator. “But I’m trying to make up for that now.”\nIs he ever. Terry Collins was practically glowing while talking about Cespedes’ steal of third in the sixth inning.\nHoward Simmons/New York Daily News Cespedes' steal of third base in the 6th inning proves huge for the Mets. “Yoenis got a great jump there and it just shows there’s not a phase of this game that he can’t do,” Collins said. “It was a big play for us.”\n“My thinking was that I was confident I would make and I felt like I knew I could put us ahead,” Cespedes said.\nIt put Cespedes in position to score the tie-breaking run when Trevor Cahill bounced a curveball to strike out Michael Conforto. The inning would’ve ended had the ball not bounced away from catcher Miguel Montero.\nAnybody remember Mickey Owen? (Look him up, dear reader).\nOn the play, Conforto reached first and Cespedes steamed home with the run that snapped a 2-2 tie.\nRemarkable things seem to happen when Cespedes is around and this was no different – it was the second go-ahead run to score on a strikeout in postseason history. Adrian Beltre also scored that way for the Rangers in a 2011 division series.\nHoward Simmons/New York Daily News With each game that passes, Cespedes draws closer to free agency. “I was preparing myself for the ball to hit the dirt,” Cespedes said. “It happened before, but I wasn’t able to go ahead yet. So in my mind, I was trying to be prepared for anything that happened.”\nCespedes’ aggressiveness on the bases is part of a team-wide attempt to “keep the foot on the gas,” as David Wright put it.\nThe Mets are not a base-stealing team. Even Collins says so. They finished last in the National League with 51 steals during the regular season – only the Orioles’ 44 was fewer in all of baseball.\nBut they might as well be the Go-Go Mets this postseason. Give Collins and the Mets credit for stepping out of their comfort zone at such a high-pressure time of year.\nThey are trying to force opponents to throw them out on the bases and the approach has set up key runs – one in the division series clincher against the Dodgers when Murphy swiped an uncovered third base, Juan Lagares set up a run by stealing third in Game 1 of this series and two steals by Curtis Granderson helped add one in Game 2.\n“It’s an excellent game plan by our coaching staff,” Wright said. “Applying pressure to defense was our mantra coming into the playoffs.”\nCespedes is a big part of that, and not just on the bases, as he showed again Tuesday night. It felt like it had been awhile, but now Cespedes has at least one hit in 15 of 18 career postseason games and a .315 lifetime playoff average.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:35:24.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
