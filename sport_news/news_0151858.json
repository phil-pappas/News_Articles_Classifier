Thomson slugged a 3-run homer in the ninth inning that defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers 5-4 in the rubber game of the 1951 playoffs at the Polo Grounds to win the National League Pennant. (Originally published by the Daily News on October 4, 1951. This story was written by Dick Young)\nNever again will they mention George Stallings' \"Miracle Braves\" of 1914 when alluding to incredible comebacks. From now on it will be Leo Durocher's \"Miracle Giants\" - the Giants of 1951 who drove with a killing pace from 12 ½ lengths back of Brooklyn to force a pennant playoff, and then battled unbelievably from behind yesterday to take the 5-4 rubber game of the post-season set in a fashion that makes pulp fiction writers look like rank conservatives.\nTheir entire struggle through the stretch seemed so much wasted effort as they went into the last of the ninth trailing by three runs because of the tie-smashing blast the Brooks had put on Sal Maglie in the previous frame. But the Jints, who never gave up in the face of Brooklyn's \"runaway pennant,\" didn't quit now. They banged Don Newcombe out of business with three hits and then, with only two outs left between them and also-ran status, won the game and flag on Bobby Thomson's three-run buzzer into the lower left deck of the Polo Grounds off Ralph Branca.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nThe moment Bobby's $200,000 circuit shot hit the seats to bring back the forgotten glory of Giant baseball with the first flag in 14 years, the howling horseshoe built in the hollow of the upper Harlem became a scene of animated madness. Thomson was still circling the bases, toward manager Leo Durocher at third, when second sacker Eddie Stanky bounded from the Giant dugout, leaped on the manager, smothered him with caresses and kisses, and wrestled him to the ground.\nWhile this fantastic love scene continued, Thomson reached-home with a prodigious leaping broad jump, landing amid the mass of teammates who had rushed onto the field to hug and hammer him with affection. Soon the swarming fans were in the act. They lifted Thomson to their shoulders. They clawed at him, hoping for some piece of his uniform. They threw kisses at him. They clutched his hands…his arms…his legs. Bobby pleaded to be let down, then forced his difficult way toward the clubhouse in center field.\nNew York Daily News The New York Daily News published this article on Oct. 4, 1951.

New York Daily News The New York Daily News published this article on Oct. 4, 1951. Previous Next Enlarge The other Giants found it easier - all except Durocher. Here was the man whom these wild eyed fans had hated only 3 ½ seasons ago - when Leo was the Dodger manager. Now, they idolized him. They patted the remaining hair that tries so hard to cover his head. They grabbed him; refused to let him go. He was the last to let him go. He was the last to force his way through the mauling mob and disappear up the steps. And, all the while, as he inched his way, Leo kept waving, and shouting joyously, and laughing.\nIt wasn't too many minutes earlier that this same Durocher had stood, head bowed in the third base coaching box, pawing the turf forlornly with his toe. His Giants were coming up for their last licks. The memorable comeback which had swept them through 38 victories in their last 46 games had been, apparently, for naught. All the torment in the hearts of the Giant fans among the 34,320 who attended, reflected in Leo's futile expression. They were three-runs down, with only three outs left - and they were facing Newcombe, who had stifled them with four hits up to this point.\nThen Al Dark bounced a hit wide of first, the ball trickling away from Hodges' diving effort. Leo clapped his hands, shouting encouragement to Don Mueller at the plate - but it was a half-hearted, unbelieving gesture.\nThen Mueller smashed another wide of first. Again Hodges dived, but this one, hit harder, flew by and into right, sending Dark to third. Now, when Leo banged his palms together, and shouted encouragement to Monte Irvin at bat, there was a sincerity in his actions. A homer would mean a new life - a tie score - and a homer is always possible at the Polo Grounds. The fans, too, came alive with a deafening roar as Irvin dug in, and Dodger manager Chuck Dressen walked to the mound for a chat with Newcombe.\nNewcombe was wearying, and every one was aware of it. The 20-game winner had been pitching his heart and arm out to get the Brooks this far. He had pitched a do-or-die shutout last Saturday night in Philly, had come back the next day with almost six more innings of scoreless relief, and with two days rest, had returned for the winner-take-all game and had run his scoreless streak through 21 2/3 innings before the Jints scored on him in the seventh.\nDaily News New York Giants fans take in the action during best of three playoff series against the Brooklyn Dodgers at the Polo Grounds. Dressen had Ralph Branca and Clem Labine pumping furiously in the bullpen, but Newcombe was his best - and he decided to stick with Don. Newk relieved part of the enveloping pressure by getting Irvin, the league's leading RBI man, to foul softly to Hodges.\nBut that was to be the last out of the season for the Newk - and for the Brooks. Whitey Lockman, next up, slashed a couble to left that delivered Dark and sent Mueller into third. Don twisted his left ankle sliding into the bag and had to be removed on a stretcher. He will miss the first two games of the Series.\nNow the Giants were very much back in the screwy race that had gone through a record 157 games. One run was in, and two more men were in scoring position. Any sort of decent single by Thomson would tie the count. The Giant fans couldn't ask for a better setup; couldn't want a different batter than the man who had been the key clouter of the fabulous Fall drive - the man who was leading his club in homers and who was destined to drive in six of his club's eight runs in this three game series.\nAlmost prophetically, Durocher shot his arm in the air, toward the left stands, in the familiar coaching gesture that implores a homer. Branca fired, and Thomson took - a sharp curve that broke down and over the inside of the plate for a strike. Again Branca would up and fired - a fast ball, high. Thomson's bat, fairly drooling for the string-straight pitch, lashed at the ball, and sent it humming on a line past the stunned stare of leftfielder Andy Pafko. Over the green wall, it went into the hands of some fan who now possesses perhaps the most coveted souvenir in Giant baseball history.\nNot until then at the moment they won their 14th modern NL flag, had the Giants led in this most dramatic of ball games. The Brooks had broken on top in the opening frame as Sal Maglie's wildness cost him a run. The usually accurate ace, whose sharp control of a crisp curve had been the major factor in his compilation of 23 victories walked Reese and Snider with one down. A pitch later, Pee Wee was racing home on Jackie Robinson's sharp hit through the left hole.\nDaily News New York Giants' hero Bobby Thomson (center) is hugged by team owner Horace Stoneham (left) and manager Leo Durocher (right). Thomson slugged 3-run homer in the ninth inning that defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers' 5-4 in the rubber game of the 1951 playoffs at the Polo Grounds to win NL Pennant. Once Maglie sweated through that stanza, however, his characteristic stuff returned. Three spread hits, one a bunt, another a bloop, were all the Brooks got from there to the eighth. The Jints, meanwhile, were tagging Newcombe rather sharply, but with no result. The familiar super support Brook pitchers receive was a largely responsible for Newk's latest string of zeros. The Brook infielders were like a bunch of susceptible kids - they caught everything.\nThe one early opportunity New York had to nick Newk was destroyed by a heads-down piece of baseball. Ironically enough, it was super-hero Thomson who wore the horns on this one. Lockman had singled to right with one down, in the second, and Bobby followed with his first of three hits - a blurred liner to left that was hit so sharply Lockman pulled up short at second. Thomson, thinking Whitey would try for third, turned first and, with head down determinedly and legs pumping furiously, sped toward second. Imagine his embarrassment when, two steps from the bag, he looked up to find Lockman there. Bobby went into reverse and tried to reach first, but was cut down by Reese's relay to Hodges - and with that died Jint bid for a tie.\nFollowing that failure, it took five innings for the Giants to sweat out that big run. The nimble -fingered fielding of Reese and Cox, who covered the left side like a Commy editorial writer, preserved Newcombe's shutout till the seventh. Then Irvin doubled to the left wall as a starter and when Lockman bunted in front of the plate, sub catcher Rube Walker, in an atrocious moment of misdirection, fired the ball to third - long after there was a possible chance of heading off Irvin. Again Thomson, who had singled and doubled, was up - and his long fly to center brought home one of the four markers he was to deliver.\nBut the tie didn't last long. There was one down in the Brook eighth when Reese lined a single to right and Snider slashed another through the right side to bring up Robinson with men on first and third. Maglie, trying to keep Robinson from pulling the ball with his strong-armed swing, kept feeding Jackie wide-breaking curves. One of these broke too wide - slithering off the end of catcher Wes Westrum's mitt and flying back to the screen. Reese rushed over on the wild pitch, and Snider sprinted two bases to third…and the Brooks apparently were breaking the tight tilt wide open.\nRobinson was given an intentional fourth ball to set up a possible DP on Pafko, but Andy shot a roller just inside third. Thomson lunged at the ball, deflecting it into foul ground, and Snider raced across on the scratch single. Then, after Hodges popped up to make make him 20-for-0 against Maglie dating back to April, Cox cracked a hotshot one-bouncer past Thomson's helplessly flagging glove to deliver Robby and put Brooklyn in front 4-1, before Walker rolled out.\nAnd so, once again, the Giants were beaten. There was nothing for Durocher to do but play out the string and wait till next year. He put Rigney in to bat for Westrum in the home eighth, and Henry Thompson in to swing for Maglie. But nothing worked. Then Larry Jansen went through the formality of retiring the Brooks in the ninth - a nice, neat, 1-2-3 job that had all the aspects of a man whipping a dead horse.\nRelated Stories Flashback to 1919: Giants, Phils play fastest full game ever A by-the-numbers look at Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams Tags: archives", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:39:43.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
