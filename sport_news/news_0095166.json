WEST POINT, N.Y. - On the court the Knicks were working their way through a grueling scrimmage, banging around and trying to catch the eyes of the coaches. But Kristaps Porzingis, the most intriguing player in camp, was seated at the scorer’s table, watching with an ice pack strapped to his left knee.\nPorzingis suffered what the team said was a mild strain in his left IT Band, which runs from the outside of the hip to the knee, during the team’s night workout Wednesday and he participated in some of Thursday’s workout, but was held out of the contact portion of the practice.\nPorzingis, the No. 4 overall pick, has suffered a series of minor tweaks, beginning with a tweak of his hip in his predraft workout with the Knicks, an injury that nagged him through the Las Vegas Summer League. The current injury, like the one in his Knicks’ predraft workout, came without contact.\n“I was just running by myself, 5-on-0 [drills] and just something happened,” Porzingis said. “It’s not a big deal.\n“For cautious reasons I didn’t practice. My knee’s a little sore, but I’ll be fine. I’ll probably be practicing [Friday.] It’s just like a wrong movement and I got a little pinch in the knee. But it’s fine. I practiced today limited and then they pulled me off. [Today] I’ll be going 100 percent.”\nPorzingis said he didn’t believe it, but the Knicks have maintained that he is still growing - either onto his 7-foot-3 frame or at least bulking up his slender physique.\n“I think it’s a concern for all of our players, but in particular young players that are still kind of developing as men,” Knicks coach Derek Fisher said. “At [20] years old and 7-feet tall, he’s actually still growing. So there are things you have to be conscious of and aware of.\n“All of our players, even though we’re a team we have individualized programs of development. A big part of his is keeping him healthy and that means there’ll be times that we have to make decisions that kind of help him protect himself and we feel like is best for his long-term growth.”\nPorzingis has played professionally in Spain, where he said that two-a-day workouts like the ones the Knicks conducted Tuesday and Wednesday are common - although he noted that the Knicks’ workouts were more intense.\nAnd even with 11 pounds added to his frame since he was drafted, Porzingis is still thin - a fact accentuated by his battling in the paint against Kevin Seraphin. Porzingis is listed at 233 pounds while Seraphin, despite giving up six inches to Porzingis, outweighs him by 45 pounds.\n“He’s a huge dude,” Porzingis said. “I think it’s good for me to go up against him. He’s very heavy, very big. Just to prepare myself for what’s coming in the league, he’s one of the biggest dudes there is, so that’s a good test for me now in practices. Once we start the season I will be ready for that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:42:23.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
