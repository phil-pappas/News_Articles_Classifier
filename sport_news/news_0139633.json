Gahafer was 35 of 58 for 328 yards passing with two interceptions. \nKameron Bryant threw a touchdown pass and Austin Fleming ran for a score to lead Campbell (4-4, 2-3). \nAaron Blockmon scored on a 95-yard kickoff return, and Chris Beaty scored on a 50-yard interception return to give the Camels a 13-10 halftime lead. \nGahafer ran for a 9-yard touchdown in the third quarter before the teams traded touchdowns twice in the fourth. \nGahafer completed four passes, included a 20-yarder on third-and-14, on the Eagles final drive. On fourth-and-goal with 23 seconds left, Campbell's Alan Hart was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct before Robinson scored the game-winner. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
