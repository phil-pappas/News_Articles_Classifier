Mitchell Jr. was pronounced dead at 7:56 p.m. Saturday in the emergency room at Silver Cross Hospital in New Lenox, the victim of an apparent homicide, according to the Will County coroner's office.\nWitnesses said Mitchell was standing in the street in the 100 block of Fairmont with another person when shots were fired from down the street, according to Will County Sheriff Deputy Chief Tom Budde. When police arrived at 7:23 p.m., they found Mitchell lying in the street with a gunshot wound to his head, and he was taken to Silver Cross, Budde said.\nNo one else was hurt, Budde said.\nPolice did not know as of Sunday afternoon whether Mitchell was the target, and they do not believe the shots came from a vehicle, Budde said. Police canvassed the area but found no suspects.\n\"We are still getting information from witnesses. This is more difficult than it should be,\" Budde said Sunday, referring to a lack of cooperation from the witnesses.\nslafferty@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown Law Enforcement Joliet", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ad61b/turbine/ct-sta-lockport-township-homicide-st-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:23:52.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
