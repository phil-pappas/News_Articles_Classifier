His sister has come out in the open against him. SGPC chief Avtar Singh Makkar put all the speculations regarding Gurmukh Singh’s resignation to rest by clarifying that the Jathedar had met him and discussed the scenario but none of the Jathedars had offered to quit. He said all the Sikh high priests were united and so was the family of Giani Gurmukh Singh. However, Jathedar Giani Gurmukh Singh’s sister Bibi Sharanjit Kaur and her husband Giani Sukhjinder Singh, who is a granthi at the Golden Temple, are displeased with the Jathedar for being a part of the decision to grant pardon to the dera chief. Talking to a section of media, Giani Sukhjinder Singh said the ties would remain sour till Giani Gurmukh Singh clarified his position on the issue. Meanwhile, activists of Sikh Sadbhavna Dal led by their leader Bhai Baldev Singh Vadala visited the residence of Bibi Sharanjit Kaur and presented a ‘siropa’ (robe of honour) to her for speaking up against the decision. Dal Spokesperson Balvinder Singh said they had decided to felicitate Bibi Sharanjit Kaur with Mai Bhago Award.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:05:12.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
