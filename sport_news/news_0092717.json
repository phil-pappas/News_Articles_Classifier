That's the only thing that works on my skin, because I have sensitive skin. I like the soap because it makes me feel squeaky clean.\nDo you do your own make-up?\nI think because my profession demands so much make-up, I have a professional artist, but my personal make-up style is very simple and minimalistic. I love using sunblock instead of foundation. I think it gives you a nice sheen and glow. I use a lot of mascara, and a cheek tint and gloss.\nWhat do you think is sexy, beauty-wise?\nIt sounds like a really cliched answer but if you're happy you feel good and beautiful. Also, if you take good care of your skin and have glowing skin that's sexy.\nAny idols growing up?\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan â€” I've always looked up to her for her beauty and the way she carries herself.\nWhat are some tips you've taken from beauty artists and use daily?\nI like to wear eyeliner because it brightens and highlights the shape of your eyes and I also use mascara to give it that extra pop.\nWhat's the weirdest thing you've tried in the name of beauty?\nI actually do this quite often. I use tomatoes on my face. I squash them and rub them on the skin. I feel that it gives you a really nice glow.\nDo you have a signature fragrance?\nFor Her by Narciso Rodriguez. I've been using it forever, my mom uses it and I've taken it from her.\nAny home remedies that you use for your skin or hair?\nSince I was young, I remember my grandmother sitting me down and putting coconut oil in my hair every Sunday. So that hasn't changed, even today I follow that.\nDo you gravitate toward a lip colour and if so, which shade?\nI like pinks. I use reds more for formal occasions rather than casual events.\nAny beauty disasters growing up?\nYeah, who doesn't. It's just a part of how you learn. When I breakout, that's a beauty disaster for me.\nWhat's the best beauty advice you've ever received?\nJust to be as natural as possible. To let your skin breathe, that's really important.\nThe one beauty product you can't live without\nMy Vichy sunblock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:42:59.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
