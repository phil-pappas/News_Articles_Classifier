Since both share the same division, and have 82 years of history and a 100-mile stretch of interstate between them, the contest will be considered a rivalry game.\nBut when you think of football and rivalry games, the first thing that jumps to mind is not necessarily your typical mid-season NFC East slugfest. No, naturally, you will think of college football. Of bands being on the field when they should not be, of rivalry trophies , of pageantry and colors.\nLike every other NFL locker room, the Giants have some veterans of college football's most storied and famous rivalries among their ranks. And they will tell you there are some clear differences when the Eagles play the Giants as compared to, say, Alabama and Auburn.\n\"I think the rivalry is mostly throughout the fans,\" Giants rookie safety Landon Collins, an Alabama product, said. \"Us players, we just go out there and play and try to beat the other team , no matter what, if it's a rivalry game or any other game.\nPLUS : How 'hot sauce' made Giants RB Shane Vereen an ace pass-catcher\n\"In college, players are more involved. It's our school versus their school. We've got a lot of status on our side, we've got a record to [maintain]. It was more of an ownership thing in college.\"\nAnother major difference is the fact that no matter who wins or loses on Monday night, the Eagles and the Giants will be doing this again on Jan. 3 in the Meadowlands. When Giants guard Geoff Schwartz was at Oregon, the annual \"Civil War\" game with Oregon State was it. Someone would win, someone would lose, and both teams would have to live with the result for a year. That is not the case in the NFL.\n\"Part of it is, you play your rival twice a year. So you obviously see them again,\" Schwartz said. \"The outcome of the first game carries over to the second game. And typically in a rivalry game in college, one team can dominate a rivalry for while . In the NFL, you don't win eight in a row over somebody very often.\"\nThe Giants are cornerback Trevin Wade's fourth team. He has also played for the Browns, Lions and Saints. The transient nature of life in the NFL changes the rivalry outlook for players, he said.\n\"It's way different,\" said Wade, who played at Arizona, whose main rival is Arizona State. \"In college, I feel like people are more prideful, more loyal. That will, forever, be your college. In the pros, you can get shipped around.\n\"It's still intense (in the NFL). It's just not like in college.\"\nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below. Follow him on Twitter @JamesKratch .
