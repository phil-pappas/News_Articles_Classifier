However it was the Green Hornets’ Kiddie Corps who ultimately stole the show. \nSophomore Leah Zellner scored in the first half and freshmen Madison Orobono and Kayla Kisthardt added second half goals to lead the unbeaten Green Hornets to 3-0 Eastern Pennsylvania Conference victory over the pesky Zephyrs. \nJunior Meredith Sholder was held without a goal for the first time this season, but the University of North Carolina recruit registered all three assists. \nDefender Delaney Ahn , midfielders Alicia Cooperman and Carly Philbin , forward Laura Smerker and goalkeeper Paige Garloff were the seniors acknowledged in the pregame ceremony. \n“We really wanted to step up for the seniors and win it for them,” said Zellner, who plays forward. “It was really challenging. The other team (Whitehall) played really well. But I think we stepped up nice, and the seniors did a great job.” \nRELATED : Emmaus field hockey standout Alicia Cooperman sings her heart out \nWhitehall (13-3 overall, 11-2 league) has suffered its only league losses against Emmaus (16-0, 14-0), which will be the top seed when the EPC playoffs start on Saturday. The Green Hornets also defeated the Zephyrs 5-0 on Sept. 29. \nWhitehall gave Emmaus all it could handle this time until Orobono and Kisthardt scored just 29 seconds apart to give the Green Hornets a 3-0 lead with 19:55 left in the game. \n“We expected it to be a little bit tough,” said Emmaus’s Sue Butz-Stavin, who earlier this season became the nation’s all-time winningest field hockey coach. “Whitehall has some great athletes and some very skilled field hockey players.” \nJust prior to the last two goals, Whitehall had a 2-on-0 fastbreak but the ball rolled ahead of the pack and Garloff sprinted out of the box to make a nifty kick save before the Zephyrs could catch up to it. \nWith the game scoreless, Sholder got off a deep straightaway shot off a corner. The ever-present Zellner was positioned in front of the cage and cleverly knocked it past Whitehall goalie Kayla Nailor with 20:42 left in the first half. \n“Meredith just hit it across and I tipped it in,” Zellner said. \nWhitehall had several scoring chances but was unable to get the equalizer. Later, the two-goal surge seemed to deflate the Zephyrs as Emmaus dominated from that point on. \nStill, Butz-Stavin would like to see improvement in certain areas. \n“We need to do a better job filling the passing lanes,” she said. “We need to do a better job in space. And we need to keep the ball in the circle more to get second shots.” \nGenerally speaking, the second half was more to Butz-Stavin’s liking. \n“We were connecting with our smaller passes instead of doing so much dribbling,” she said. \n“I thought we did really well with our passes in the backfield,” Zellner said, “and the team did a really nice job stepping up to the ball. We had to step up to the challenge.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @TomHinkelLV .
