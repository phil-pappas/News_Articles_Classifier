He can earn an additional $3 million annually in performance bonuses based on plate appearances: $300,000 each for 250 and 300, and $400,000 apiece for 350 and each additional 50 through 600. \nSuzuki has 2,935 major league hits after getting 1,278 in Japan. \nSuzuki had 91 hits in 153 games and 438 plate appearances for the Marlins this year but batted a career-low .229, dropping his career average to .314. His slugging percentage was .279, the lowest among all major league players with more than 300 at-bats. But injuries to other outfielders, including slugger Giancarlo Stanton, made Suzuki nearly a regular. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:30:11.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
