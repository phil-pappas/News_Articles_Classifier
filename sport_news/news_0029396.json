Best in the country? Yeah, when the offense got rolling. Most frustrating team? Yeah, that too, when the Buckeyes blew a 14-point lead. Leaves are awarded on a zero-to-five basis.\nOffense (4 leaves) The positive: Ohio State rolled up its season high in points while committing no turnovers and converting all six red-zone opportunities into touchdowns. The Buckeyes don’t yet have all of the wrinkles ironed out of their suits, but they looked sharper than they have most weeks.\n>>  Dispatch  sports editor Ray Stein answers your questions about Buckeyes football during our weekly chat, 1 p.m. Thursday, dispatch.com/osuchat \nDefense (3 leaves) Last week, Zander Diamont. This week, Perry Hills. Neither of those opposing quarterbacks, you’ll note, is named Denard Robinson, but it was hard to tell the way OSU’s defense played them. Maryland totaled 105 yards vs. Michigan but put 386 yards on the Buckeyes. Seriously?\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \nSpecial teams (3 leaves) Cameron Johnston did as well as he could limiting the damage by uber-returner Will Likely by averaging 54.7 yards on three punts. Kicker Jack Willoughby fared less well, pushing a 44-yard field-goal attempt to allow a momentum swing and sending a kickoff out of bounds. Those are killers.\n>> Get the most out of college football season, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nCoaching (3 leaves) The scheme allowing J.T. Barrett to replace Cardale Jones at QB in the red zone feels something like a trick — a way for Urban Meyer to keep the howling wolves at bay. But it worked like a treat — at least for one week.

But most of the empty seats were filled by the second quarter. A little while later, the Ohio Stadium denizens were starting to get an empty feeling as Maryland rallied to tie, but law was restored soon enough.\nOpponent (3 leaves) Maryland was outscored 73-6 and committed nine turnovers in its past two games, blowout losses to West Virginia and Michigan. So the Terrapins were playing with house money against the Buckeyes when it was tied in the third quarter. There are worse ways for coach Randy Edsall to get bounced.\nOfficiating (2 leaves) First officials committed the Cardinal Sin — checking the on-field microphone during Script Ohio. More sins followed, including a fistful of terrible spots. And thankfully replay showed that Joey Bosa didn’t “target” with his hands.\nrstein@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:21:01.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
