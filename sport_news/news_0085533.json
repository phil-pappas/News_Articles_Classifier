Manchester’s TD, Hawley’s kick completes SV’s final-minute rally. Multi-sport CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCameron Manchester rushed 7 yards for a score and Tim Hawley converted the PAT kick with four seconds remaining Saturday, lifting Susquehanna Valley to a scintillating 13-12 football victory over visiting Owego. \nThe decisive score-and-kick came 59 seconds after Patrick Bilbrey reversed field for a 65-yard scoring run that put the Indians out front by 12-6. They failed to convert a two-point pass. \nHawley returned the ensuing kickoff to near midfield. The tying TD came when quarterback Manchester, after having roll-out pass intentions thwarted by sound Owego defense, took off on the run and caught a key block from flanker Kyle Novobilski on his path across the goal line. \nHawley, who had a PAT kick blocked five minutes earlier, converted uneventfully following a timeout. \nBilbrey closed with 168 rushing yards, while the hosts’ Brandon Vosbury and Zac Knewasser teamed for 249. \nThe Sabers were blanked until Knewasser rushed 10 yards for a TD with 5:12 to play. Owego’s Logan Neira put his team ahead with a 1-yard rush midway through the first quarter. \nNewark Valley 14, Greene 12: Nick Schermerhorn threw for a touchdwon and rushed for one as unbeaten Newark Valley came from behind to defeat visiting Greene in a Division IV game. \nTrailing 12-7 in the third quarter, NV made two fourth-down conversions on the final drive that culminated with Schermerhorn’s 10-yard touchdown run with three minutes, 10 seconds left. \nThe Cardinals’ defense also made a crucial stop in the fourth quarter to hold on to the win. On fourth down with 1:10 remaining, Greene attempted a pass on the 24-yard line, but Schermerhorn knocked the ball out of the receiver’s hands. \nThe Cardinals led 7-0 after the first quarter, thanks to a 20-yard pass from Schermerhorn to Conner Coleman. However, running back Luke Erickson scored two touchdowns to put Greene ahead. Erickson rushed for 164 yards. \nSchermerhorn rushed for 31 yards and completed one pass. \nThe Cardinals (5-0, 1-0) are 7-for-7 on extra points over the last two games, with Coleman going 2-for-2 against Greene. He had five last week in the Cardinals’ come-from-behind, 35-32 win over Tioga. \nGreene (2-3) is 0-2 in division. \nUnion-Endicott 26, Norwich 20: Chris Wright rushed for 87 yards and a pair of touchdowns as host Union-Endicott won its first game of the season. \nWright's second touchdown came on a 5-yard run in the fourth quarter and gave the Tigers a 26-14 lead. \nCollin Nixon contributed 94 rushing yards, including a 58-yard scoring in the second quarter that pulled U-E to 7-6. \nNorwich (1-4) took a 14-6 lead on a 18-yard touchdown run by Cole Rifanburg in the third quarter. \nU-E tied the score on a 1-yard scoring by Wright, who also scored on the ensuing two-pointer. \nJoshua Greenwood's 1-yard scoring run gave the Tigers the lead for keeps in the fourth quarter. Dom Fenton's PAT made it 21-14. \nThe teams combined for seven turnovers, four by U-E. \nWindsor 35, Oneonta 0: Trevor Kimble scored three touchdowns and Nate Fendick added two as visiting Windsor cruised to a Section 4 victory. \nWindsor scored on two straight possessions in the second quarter. Kimble scored on a seven-yard run and threw a three-yard pass to Cole Thurston for a 13-0 lead. Fendick added a 54-yard interception return with 51 seconds left in the half to extend the lead to 21-0. \nThe Black Knights scored on the first play from scrimmage to start the second half on Kimble’s 60-yard pass to Jordan Haven. \nMary Rakas and Kevin Stevens contributed.
