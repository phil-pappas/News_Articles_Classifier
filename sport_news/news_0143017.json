(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) \nLONDON (AP) — Jose Mourinho had to watch from the stands as Andy Carroll nodded in a late winner to give West Ham a 2-1 win over 10-man Chelsea, handing the defending champions a fifth loss of the Premier League season. \nMourinho was sent to the stands at halftime, apparently incensed over refereeing decisions that saw a goal by Cesc Fabregas disallowed and Nemanja Matic sent off for two yellow cards. \nCarroll took full advantage as the substitute striker leapt above the Chelsea defense to head Aaron Cresswell’s pinpoint cross past goalkeeper Asmir Begovic in the 79th minute. That extended West Ham’s best-ever start to a Premier League season, having now beaten Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea. \nChelsea, in contrast, is down in 15th place, 11 points behind provisional leader Arsenal. \nArgentine striker Mauro Zarate opened the scoring in the 17th minute, drilling home a low first-time shot after a cagey Chelsea defense failed to deal with a corner. \nMatic was then sent off for a second yellow card after he hauled down striker Diafra Sakho in the 44th minute. \nChelsea felt aggrieved twice in the first half as a header by Kurt Zouma in the 36th minute all but crossed the line but was just kept out by goalkeeper Manuel Lanzini. A replay using goal-line technology showed the ball had failed to fully cross the line by the slimmest of margins. \nFabregas then had a goal marginally ruled offside as Chelsea pressed hard for a first half equalizer. \n“Of course I would definitely moan if those decisions went against us. But they weren’t mistakes,” West Ham manager Slaven Bilic said. “I feel for him (Mourinho), a lot from his point of view has gone against Chelsea.” \nMourinho did not talk to media after the game. \nEngland defender Gary Cahill equalized for Chelsea from close range in the 56th minute, following a corner by Willian, before Carroll struck to send West Ham into provisional third place in the standings. \nIt was the England striker’s first goal of the campaign after an injury-plagued season. \n“His quality has never been in doubt, but we’ve just wanted him to get fit, and out of injuries long term,” Bilic said. “We are playing good, we are doing well, we deserved to win today.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:29:32.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
