The Tigers are 22-9 against East Division opponents since Miles arrived and have won 12 of their last 14 games against the opposite division since 2010. This season LSU has scored a touchdown in the first quarter of all five games and have scored a touchdown on its first drive in three of those five. The Tigers' 624 yards of total offense were the second most a Miles-coached LSU team has racked up and the highest total in a conference game. The Tigers' total was their highest against a league foe since Oct. 31, 1987, at Ole Miss in Jackson when the Tigers had 630 total yards. With 396 rushing yards on Saturday, LSU has now topped 200 yards on the ground in every game this season. Two Tiger running backs rushed for more than 150 yards in a game ( Derrius Guice with 161, Leonard Fournette with 158) for the second time in school history. The other was Sept. 7, 1996, against Houston when Kevin Faulk and Rondell Mealey rushed for 246 and 161 yards respectively. Guice led the team with 161 yards on the ground on 16 carries. Fournette rushed for 158 yards on 20 attempts and now has 1,022 rushing yards this season to become the fastest player in program history to reach 1,000 yards in a season, needing just five games to do so. The previous fastest was Charles Alexander in 1977: 175 carries to gain 1,003 yards with 12 touchdowns in seven games. Fournette's 87-yard touchdown run gives him three runs over 70 yards this season, and he has scored three touchdowns of 60 yards are longer this season. Brandon Harris threw for a season- and career-best 228 yards on 18-for-28 passing. By halftime, Harris had attempted and completed season-highs (13-for-23). His 62-yard TD to Travin Dural was the longest of Harris' career. His 28 attempts were the most by an LSU QB since Zach Mettenberger put the ball up 33 times in a 27-24 loss at Ole Miss on Oct. 19, 2013. Malachi Dupre hauled in a season-, team- and career-best six catches for 74 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:07:53.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
