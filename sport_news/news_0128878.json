The extra point try failed, accounting for the 20-14 final score. \nA second consecutive loss dropped Millburn to 3-2, 0-2 in the Colonial Division. \nOrange fullback Dadmuel Firmin scored the game's first touchdown on a one-yard run in the opening quarter. The extra point attempt by sophomore Louis Thompson was good. \nMillburn tied the score in the second quarter on an 8-yard run by Moshier and junior Jack Kirshenbaum's extra point. \nA 40-yard scamper by Harris and Thompson's extra point gave the Tornadoes a 14-7 halftime lead. \nMiller senior running back Zack Weinstein (23 carries for 110 yards) scored from four yards out in the third quarter. Kirshenbaum's extra point forged the contest's third tie. \nThe Millers also squandered a golden scoring opportunity following a 75-yard kickoff return to the Orange 10 by senior Nick Minter. \nMilburn came away with no points after Kirshenbaum missed a 23-yard field goal. \nMILLER NOTES \nThe team's three-game stretch against the top teams in the Colonial Division comes to a close Friday, Oct. 23, when Verona High School (6-0, 2-0) pays a visit to Millburn High School's Dr. Keith A. Neigel Field. \nSenior Night ceremonies are scheduled to begin 30 minutes prior to the 7 p.m. kickoff. \nVerona, which shares first place in the Colonial Division with Orange and Cedar Grove (5-1 overall), carries a state-best 17-game winning streak into the contest. \nThe Hillbillies, the reigning New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association North Jersey, Section 1, Group 1 champions, are coming off a 42-16 defeat of Malcolm X Shabazz High School Oct. 16 in Newark. \nMillburn, Shabazz (1-4 overall) and Newark West Side High School (0-6 overall) all stand at 0-2 in the division. \nGames against West Side (Saturday, Oct. 31, at 4 p.m. at Untermann Field in Newark) and Shabazz (Friday, Nov. 6, at 7 p.m. at Shabazz Stadium in Newark) close out Millburn's division schedule. \nEmail: connellyj@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:13:46.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
