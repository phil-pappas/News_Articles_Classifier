The Mountain West Conference is not looking particularly strong, meaning the Aggies still have a shot at competing for a conference championship. It all starts Saturday against the Colorado State Rams. \nThe Rams are 2-2 heading into their game with the Aggies, but they could be as good as 4-0. Their two losses were by a combined six points and came against Power 5 schools, one of which was against in-state rival Colorado. The Rams finished second in the MWC last season and are still a solid team. Granted they did lose their head coach and starting quarterback, but they are still a solid team. \nThe Aggies will have their hands full against the Rams on Saturday. Here are the key stats the Aggies need to focus on: \n\nk. For Myers' career, he has 865 passing yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. He also has 15 rushes for 70 yards and five touchdowns. \nMyers' experience as the starting quarterback makes him a plug-and-play option. His knowledge of the offense and relationship with his receivers and running backs will make his transition back to the starter smooth. \n\nDevonte Robinson has been the lone bright spot of the Aggie offense. His 15.2 yards per catch and his ability to break out for a big play make him Myers' biggest and best target. Robinson will be key for Myers' transition. \n\nThe Rams lost quarterback Garrett Grayson to the NFL last season and have leaned on Nick Stevens in 2015. Stevens is having a solid sophomore campaign, having thrown nine touchdowns and four interceptions. Wide receiver Rashard Higgins has caught a touchdown pass in every game he's played and is averaging 104 ypg. \nThe Aggie defenders will have to shut down Higgins to have a chance at the upset. \n\nColorado State running back Jason Olden Jr. is having a solid season. He's averaging 4.4 ypc and has two touchdowns through four games. Vigil will be asked to slow down Olden Jr. and the rest of the Ram running backs. \n\nThe Aggie secondary is allowing 204 receiving ypg, and it will need to continue that solid play Saturday. The Rams are putting up 268 passing ypg and look to increase that number at Maverick Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:42:27.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
