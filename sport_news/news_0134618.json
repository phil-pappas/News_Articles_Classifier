They never trailed beyond an early 3-0 deficit following the Golden Bears’ opening drive and led by double digits for most of the night.\nThe Bruins (5-2, 2-2 Pac-12) had lost consecutive October games for the third consecutive season, including a 56-35 thrashing at Stanford last Thursday that dropped the Bruins out of the Top 25.\n“We found a way to pull out of it (before),” UCLA coach Jim Mora said, “and we did again.”\nQuarterback Josh Rosen delivered arguably his best performance to date in front of an announced crowd of 57,046.\nThe 18-year-old freshman completed 34 of 47 passes for 399 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions.\nHis 34 completions are a school single-game record, surpassing a mark shared by Brett Hundley, who completed 33 in a nonconference game against Memphis last season, and Richard Brehaut, who did it at Arizona State in 2010.\n“He has a lot of confidence because he’s prepared,” Mora said. “He’s a rare kid.”\nRosen was clicking from the get-go.\nAfter senior kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn tied the game following a 44-yard field goal on the Bruins’ opening drive, Rosen had a nice follow-up act.\nTo cap a 13-play, 70-yard drive, he floated a pass into the back corner of the end zone to junior receiver Thomas Duarte for a 7-yard touchdown, the sixth time this season that he’s found the Mater Dei High product for a score.\n“With Josh, you can never faze him,” Duarte said. “I don’t know what it is about him, but we all love it. Whatever happened on that last play, it doesn’t matter to him. He wants to play the next play and dominate.”\nDuarte finished with career highs of 10 catches and 141 yards and the touchdown.\nRosen capped UCLA’s next drive with another scoring toss, hitting Devin Fuller along the sidelines as the senior receiver turned it into a 19-yard touchdown.\n1 2 3 Next Page Related: UCLA-Cal box score", "external_links": ["http://sports.ocregister.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510220064&home=64&vis=59&final=true"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:09:18.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
