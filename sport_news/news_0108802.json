The decision to spend public funds in this fashion is easy to understand and, for most, probably easy to support. For these reasons, the city's attempt to tip-toe the deal through the public process, as detailed by The Oregonian/OregonLive's Steve Duin , is baffling. Worse, it's an insult to the residents of Troutdale and a violation of the bedrock principle of open government. Bad governance is bad governance notwithstanding good intentions.\nTroutdale, as Duin explained, was in a difficult position. The rifle and related property in the city's possession, including several magazines and a protective vest, belong to Lucas Padgett, Jared's older brother. He's entitled to their return and has requested it. But casually handing over equipment implicated in two deaths – those of Padgett and his victim, Emilio Hoffman – is repellent. So those involved came to an agreement. The city would keep the rifle and other material and cut a check for $3,950. Fair enough.\nBut then, as Duin reported, officials did just about everything short of outright lying to hide the transaction from the public.\nThe agenda for the Oct. 13 Council meeting at which the deal was approved describes it thus: \"A Resolution to Acquire Certain Personal Property and Settle Certain Litigation.\" Anyone curious enough to delve into the accompanying informational packet for details would come away similarly uninformed.\nThe staff report attributed to city attorney Ed Trompke, for instance, explains that the \"circuit court has preliminarily ruled that the moving party in the above-referenced case is entitled to return of personal property currently in city's custody.\" Moreover, \"the moving party has offered that in lieu of returning the property at a future date, the city may purchase the property for $3,950.00, and this appears to be an equitable determination of value.\"\nNo names. No description of the property or any other information that might inform the public except for a case number. Instead, mumbo jumbo and misdirection, all of which amounts to a deliberate nose-thumbing at Oregon's open meetings law, the intent of which is impossible to misconstrue: \"The Oregon form of government requires an informed public aware of the deliberations and decisions of governing bodies and the information upon which such decisions were made.\"\nFor purposes of transparency, the law requires public bodies like the Troutdale City Council to provide notice that must \"include a list of the principal subjects anticipated to be considered at the meeting.\" These subjects are normally included in an agenda, whose items should be \"sufficiently descriptive so that interested persons will get an accurate picture of the agenda topics,\" according to the Attorney General's Public Records and Meetings Manual .\nTroutdale's notice was designed to do just the opposite. Why? Because, as Trumpke told Duin, \"It didn't seem productive to re-open the debate between the gun-rights and gun-control groups when what we're talking about is acquiring specific evidence in this specific case.\"\nWhile Trompke, who declined to speak to The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, and other officials may have been motivated by the best of intentions, they don't get to decide which debates are \"productive\" for taxpayers to have and which are not. The directions in which such behavior can lead are profoundly disturbing, which is why Oregon has an open-meetings law.\nAnd following the law, not flouting it, is why we thought cities engaged lawyers like Trompke.
