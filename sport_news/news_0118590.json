(Tony Ding/Associated Press) \nAs it pieced its confidence back together this week and began initial preparations for No. 23 Michigan, Maryland’s defense shifted its attention to the Wolverines’ pro-style offense and a familiar face in senior quarterback Jake Rudock. Maryland defensive coordinator Keith Dudzinski shared a light moment with reporters on Wednesday after being asked if he had ever faced a quarterback from two different schools in back-to-back seasons. \n[ Can the Michigan D lead the way to a surprising playoff berth? ] \nIn ways, Rudock’s path to becoming Michigan’s starter is bizarre. After announcing he would transfer from Iowa last spring, he first needed to receive a waiver from the Big Ten in order to be eligible in Ann Arbor, where he emerged as the starter over Shane Morris earlier this month and has quickly established himself as a competent understudy to Jim Harbaugh. Rudock has thrown for 776 yards through four games, completing 62.9 percent of his passes with four touchdowns and five interceptions while managing a Michigan offense that is beginning to form an identity under Harbaugh’s new regime. \n“They have a lot of different packages from an offensive standpoint,” Dudzinski said. “They do a lot of good things with their schemes. The big thing is getting guys to fit the run the right way. If you have one guy who is not fitting it the right way, they have guys that can expose that. We have to be better with our gap-fits up front and better with our eyes at linebacker at the second level. They’ll run, run, run and then hit you with the play action pass so you have to be ready on the back end. It’s a big challenge.” \nRudock is best remembered by Maryland fans as the Iowa quarterback who threw a costly fourth quarter interception in a 38-31 Terrapins’ win last season. Maryland cornerback Will Likely returned the pick 45 yards for the game’s decisive score, and later told reporters at Big Ten media day in August that he hoped Rudock would throw his direction again when Michigan visits Saturday. \nMaryland’s defense has certainly been humbled in the past three weeks, allowing more than 600 yards in losses to Bowling Green and West Virginia. For sophomore linebacker Jermaine Carter Jr., it almost seemed refreshing that he didn’t have to discuss another up-tempo spread attack with reporters on Wednesday, instead detailing Maryland’s matchup against the pro-style attack of Michigan. \n“I think Michigan has been running 25 seconds a play, but they’re trying to hit you in the mouth,” Carter Jr. said. “Whereas the teams we’ve been playing, they’re going eight or nine seconds a play … we got a little bit more time to be ready to go, we just have to match their intensity.” \nIt is a multiple offense, Dudzinski explained, featuring formations that sometimes include two or three tight ends at a time. Michigan returned four starting offensive linemen from a year ago and is currently averaging 202.2 yards rushing, with six different players scoring rushing touchdowns this season. \nMaryland, meanwhile, is ranked last in the Big Ten in rushing defense (200.2) and in total defense (467.2). \nThat also includes two scores from Rudock, who has deceptive mobility and has been credited by Maryland’s staff for his ability to manage Michigan’s offense through three weeks. Michigan’s efficiency on the ground has also helped open up the play-action passing game for Rudock, who finished 14-of-25 for 194 yards and a touchdown in last week’s win over Michigan. \n“We saw him live and in color last year. We got a good feel for what he could do. He’s very comfortable in that offensive style, he’s efficient throwing the ball, he doesn’t panic. He’s playing with a lot confidence,” Dudzinski said. \nMore from Maryland’s preparation for Michigan:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:30:10.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
