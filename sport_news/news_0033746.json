I headed out to the Bayer Museum of Agriculture for a game of horse...played on a tractor. \nThe 13th annual Antique Tractor & Engine show is Saturday and Sunday at the Museum starting at 9am both days. Admission is free. \nI competed against Kenzi Randolph from New Deal. We rode on a 1952 Massey Harris Pony. We had to take shots while moving or stopped or as a passenger. \nCheck out the challenge and the antique tractor show this weekend. \nIf you have a challenge, email me at ibeatpete@kcbd.com . I'm excited to see my 800th challenge coming up in December. Keep the challenges coming. \nCopyright 2015 KCBD . All rights reserved.
