The women's 5k is set for 5 p.m. (CT) followed by the men's 8k at 5:30 p.m.The event features a deep and talented field for both races and also provides South Region teams the opportunity to run on the course that will serve as the host of the NCAA Regional meet on Nov. 13. The men's team, currently ranked 12th in the South Region, last raced at the Greater Louisville Classic on Oct. 3, while the women's competition came Sept. 19 at the Mt. Dew Invitational.\"The meet is a very good competition,\" said head coach Jeff Pigg . \"The field includes some Top 10 teams in the country, two of the Top 3 ranked teams in the South Region along with Lipscomb, who is ranked atop the Atlantic Sun. We are really looking forward to racing again The last 2 weeks have been very productive and some of our runners, who were banged up in the early season meets, are getting back up to full speed. It will be exciting to see how we stack up in this meet. The work we have done and the level of talent we have make it fun to head into a very solid competition. The Alabama staff also puts on a great meet and it is a very nice cross country course.\"Following the Crimson Classic, North Florida has a two-week preparation for the Atlantic Sun Conference Championship meet on Oct. 30. The Ospreys will be hosting the conference championship meet at the Hayt Golf Learning Center course on the UNF campus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:20:05.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
