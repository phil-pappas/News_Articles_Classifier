Image 18 of 18 Cardinals, Lions ready for SLC clash 1 / 18 Back to Gallery \nEven though Lamar football hasn't jumped into the national rankings, Cardinals coach Ray Woodard knows there are lots of eyes on his team. \nA strong showing against Baylor, followed by an upset road victory over then-No. 5 Sam Houston State caught the attention of teams around the Southland Conference, where the Cardinals were picked to finish eighth in the preseason polls. \nNo. 23-ranked Southeastern Louisiana won't be looking past the Cardinals (2-1, 1-0 SLC) when the two teams meet up at 6 p.m. today in Hammond. \n\"If we did sneak up on (Sam Houston State), it won't happen again,\" Woodard said. \"We won't be sneaking up on (Southeastern Louisiana) and they will be ready. No doubt about that.\" \nFresh off a bye week, the Cardinals enter the game brewing with confidence and an opportunity to start conference play with wins over the top two teams in the preseason polls. \nThe Cardinals lost 61-34 at home to the Lions (2-1, 1-0) a year ago and 56-34 in Hammond the year before that, so Woodard is fully aware of what Lamar is up against. \n\"(Southeastern Louisiana) is very much the same team it was last year,\" Woodard said. \"They're a very good football team and very well coached.\" \nLions' coach Ron Roberts is aware the Lamar teams of the past two seasons don't mirror this season's Cardinals, however. \n\"(Lamar) is playing some good football right now,\" Roberts said. \n\"They always present a challenge, but they're really playing at a high level. This is a huge Southland game.\" \nRoberts and the Lions have won their past 13 homes games and believe the key to victory is keeping their eyes on what they're doing and not Lamar. \n\"We can't focus on stopping them,\" Roberts said. \n\"I know its clich√©, but we have to make sure we execute and things will take care of themselves.\" \nLamar junior running back Kade Harrington , who won Southland Offensive Player of the Week awards for his performance against Baylor and Sam Houston State, said the Cardinals are taking a different approach. \n\"We just have to stay relaxed,\" Harrington said. \"We have to remember this is just a football game and its fun.\" \nHarrington, who rushed for 230 yards and two touchdowns against Sam Houston State, said the magnitude of this game goes far beyond garnering attention. \n\"We're going to be fighting these guys for a conference championship,\" Harrington said. \"This is a game we have to win if we want to achieve our goal.\" \nDShapiro@BeaumontEnterprise.comTwitter.com/@dannyshapiro13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:18:44.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
