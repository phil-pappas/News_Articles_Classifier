Cathedral’s Jamire Clavin scored on a 92-yard punt return before quarterback Andrew Tovar ran it in the end zone for a 28-yard touchdown.\nTovar started the game off throwing an interception to St. Francis’ Sean Davitt. The Golden Knights failed to capitalized and punted, only to have Clavin score a 92-yard punt return with 6:28 left in the first quarter.\nIt didn’t take too long for St. Francis to get on the board as quarterback Miles Bryant connected with receiver Daniel Scott for a 61-yard reception before Harrick ran it in for a 4-yard TD to tie it up with 4:24 left in the quarter.\nThe scoring barrage in the first quarter didn’t end there. The Phantoms converted third-and-long with a 31-yard completion before Tovar ran 28 yards to score and take a 14-6 lead with 25.7 seconds left.\nAfter keeping possession for more than five minutes, the Golden Knights drove all the way to the end zone, with Harrick scoring his second touchdown of the night with 4:49 left in the half.\nThe Phantoms were stumped going into halftime.\nFoster answered Clavin’s punt return midway into the third quarter, scoring his very own 91-yard punt return to give the Golden Knights their first lead of the game with 5:40 left in the third.\nAdvertisement\nSt. Francis kicker Dulles Hanula made a 33-yard field goal to give the Golden Knights a 24-14 lead with 8:43 to go in the fourth. Foster sealed the deal when he ran it home from 18 yards for his second touchdown of the night.\n“We’re going to let this one sink in for a little bit,” said Foster.\nFollow SoCal Prep Legends on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and SnapChat and sign up for our newsletter .", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/socalpreplegend", "https://instagram.com/socalpreplegends/", "http://socalpreplegends.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/socalpreplegends", "http://socalpreplegends.com/newsletter", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:06:18.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
