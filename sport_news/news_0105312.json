Quarterbacks coach Danny Barrett has been named interim coach, the source says. \nIt ends a tumultuous season marked by a rash of injuries and dismal on-field play that was punctuated by UCF being ranked last in Football Bowl Subdivision in total offense. \nO'Leary agreed to a four-year contract extension in 2014 on the heels of a program-best 12-win season and Fiesta Bowl victory. \nThe 69-year-old coach leaves UCF with an 81-68 record. He went 0-11 in his first season at UCF in 2004, but took the Knights to their first-ever bowl appearance in 2005. It was the first of seven bowl berths the under O'Leary. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:32:47.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
