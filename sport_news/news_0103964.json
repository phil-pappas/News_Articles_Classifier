The appointment of the Ethics Officer or ombudsman is one of the major changes proposed in the BCCI's Memorandum of Rules and Regulations at its Annual General Meeting. The ombudsman will be appointed by the BCCI's general body \"to deal with the complaints of conflict of interest and any act of indiscipline or misconduct or violation of any of the rules and regulations of the board by an administrator\". Another important change in the clauses is the one about the board president approving every team picked by the national selection panel. This clause had helped MS Dhoni escape the axe when the earlier selection panel, headed by Krishnamachari Srikkanth, had decided to remove him as the ODI captain following the 4-0 Test series rout in Australia in 2012 but then BCCI president N Srinivasan vetoed the move. The existing clause reads: The president shall approve the composition of the team selected by the Selection Committee. The proposed clause reads: The president along with the office-bearers shall approve the composition of a team selected by the selection committee from time to time. â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:29:30.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
