That's much less than the $15.6 million granted a year ago to more than 4,900 employees. The (Champaign) News-Gazette reports (http://bit.ly/1MqucJC ) that the numbers are down because the university put across-the-board raises on hold in July pending the state budget impasse in Springfield. Officials say the raises range from $500 to more than $150,000. The money went to employees who were promoted, won awards or had other special circumstances. The university is continuing to operate under last fiscal year's budget. Officials say it's too soon to say if across-the-board raises will be reinstated when the state budget is resolved. System-wide the University of Illinois had $3.6 million in raises. ___ Information from: The News-Gazette, http://www.news-gazette.com Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:54:19.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
