However, each ended the same, in a Cavalier’ victory. \n“It’s tough facing the same team three times in a season,” Chillicothe coach Zach Breth said. “Let alone with Hillsboro being the reigning district champions over the past three years. Both teams begin to figure out what everyone can do, especially with it being the first tournament game. But we made a couple of adjustments and went with a little bit of a different roster than when we played them a week ago and it paid off for us tonight.” \nThe first half saw a lot of back-and-forth action as neither team was able to seize momentum and kick the ball across the goal line, which ultimately led to a scoreless first half. \nChillicothe (12-1-2) had a 5-0 advantage over Hillsboro in shot on goals attempts at the break. \n“We had a good bulk of ball possession in the first half,” Breth said. “We were creating chances, we didn’t give up a shot on goal; we were winning ball possession and doing everything we needed to do to win a soccer game. We just didn’t take advantage of those opportunities and we rushed. Halftime, we finally settled in and we knew if we could get one goal, we could get three or four more.” \nHalftime ended and did the Cavaliers ever settle in. \nOff a Chelsea Crabtree free kick, Hillsboro’s goalie misplayed the ball in the air and Teyanna Thompson capitalized, pushing the ball past the goal line, giving the Cavaliers a 1-0 lead with 35:02 remaining. \n“Credit to Chelsea for taking the quick kick,” Breth said. “The only one paying attention was the goal keeper at the time. And when she took the kick, we were switched on and they weren’t. Also credit to Tey for being switched on and following it up once the goalie misplayed the ball.” \nFrom that point on, junior Payten Davis decided to make her presence known. \nDavis got the ball inside the box and found the back of the net from just a few yards out to extend the Cavalier’ lead to 2-0 with 22:14 left to play. \nBut that was just the start from the Cavaliers’ stud striker. \nAfter receiving a pass from the right wing, she took two dribbles and scored from 10 yards out for her second goal of the game, making it 3-0 with 12:10 still remaining. \nHowever, Hillsboro had a quick answer less than a minute later. \nOff the kick following the Cavalier’ goal, the Indians drove down the field and connected on their only goal of the game off the foot of Taryn Magulac, cutting the deficit to 3-1 with 11:33 left. \nJust as the Indians tried to make a little bit of a rally, Davis killed their momentum as she completed the hat trick, connecting on her third goal — also from 10 yards out — making the score 4-1 with 2:47 left in the game. \n“Simply put, she pops up in the right place and the right time and scores big goals,” Breth said. \nChillicothe ended the game with 11 shots on goal, compared to just two for the Indians. \nThe Cavaliers will now move on to a district semifinal, where they’ll face the Jackson Lady Ironmen. The two teams met earlier in the season and played to a 2-2 draw. \nThat contest will take place Oct. 29 at Logan High School, with a 7:00 p.m. start time. \n“The first time we played them, we were disappointed with the outcome,” Breth said. “It was a tie, but it felt like a loss. So I think it left the right taste in our mouths for this game. We know them pretty well, so we’ll prepare for them and we’ll be ready come next Thursday.” 11 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LQoHYv TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:12:19.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
