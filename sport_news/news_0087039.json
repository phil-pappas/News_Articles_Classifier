But first remember who Pat Angerer is — well, who he was. He was the linebacker, in a small town in Iowa and for the Hawkeyes from 2006-09 and the Indianapolis Colts from 2010-13. For a decade, he was linebacker Pat Angerer. Now he was just … Pat. \nHere it was, September 2014, and one month earlier, Angerer had retired from the NFL , his foot broken and his knee needing eventual replacement. Angerer was 27, married with two kids, and with no idea what to do without football. \n“I was lost,” he says. \nThen this stranger, a physical therapist in Bettendorf, Iowa, called and said: Your friend needs you. Former Iowa teammate Brett Greenwood, who nearly died in 2011 when his heart stopped during a workout and his brain was denied oxygen while doctors slammed on his chest, was still in rehabilitation. Three years later, Greenwood had hit a plateau. He could barely walk. Barely talk. He needs someone to push him, this stranger, this physical therapist, was telling Angerer on the phone. Episode 8: Pat McAfee Show with Colts linebacker Pat Angerer \nAngerer showed up at the facility. Met the therapist, Matt Rokes. Reunited with Brett Greenwood. Watched him attack rehab for 90 minutes. \n“Every breath he takes, every step he takes, he’s beating what the doctors told him,” Angerer says. “They said he’d never do this, never do that, and he’s doing it all. He gives that to you: ‘OK I can do this. Nothing can stop me.’ ” \nHe gave it to Pat Angerer, and Angerer couldn’t just go home. \nSo this is what he did: He drove to a park, to a muddy hill the high school kids run for cross-country. He found some football shoes in the back of his truck, and he sprinted up that hill. Again. And again. \n* * * Buy Photo \nDenver Broncos' Wes Welker (83) is brought down hard by Indianapolis Colts' Pat Angerer (51) during the first half of a game on Oct. 20, 2013, at Lucas Oil Stadium. (Photo: Matt Kryger / The Star) \nPat Angerer came to Iowa first, a year before Brett Greenwood. They were from rival schools in Bettendorf, barely knew each other. Angerer was the big-time recruit in 2006, the future star. Greenwood was the walk-on, sharing a number with another Iowa walk-on. \nBut it was Greenwood who became a starter, a captain. He led the Big Ten in interceptions in 2009, playing on an Iowa defense that had 10 starters who played in the NFL — and Brett Greenwood. \n“All those NFL players,” Angerer says, “and Brett was the guy who told us what the hell to do. He was that leader.” \nAngerer was not — not at first. Not for three years. Angerer was in college to play football, but pretty soon decided he was there to have fun, too. \n“Burning it at both ends,” Angerer says. Doyel: Butler soccer, local woman make magic \nSays his coach at Iowa, Kirk Ferentz: “Pat had a couple years where he wasn’t helping himself much.” \nEntering his junior season, Angerer went to the walk-on for help. He moved next to Greenwood, started hanging out with him, staying in, rather than going out. \nAngerer became the player he was supposed to be, and then he became more. To this day, Ferentz opens fall camp by giving the Hawkeyes a handout, a 2009 quote in the local paper from a former Iowa player who says it took him a long time — too long — to realize something. \n“I’ve done some stupid stuff and had my share of fun,” Angerer had said in 2009. “But it’s never been as fun as playing in front of 70,000 people in Kinnick.” \nFerentz tells me that story, then tells me this: \n“I don’t know that we’ve had a better leader or a guy with a better heart than Pat come through our program,” Ferentz says. “He’s the truest of friends, teammates. They don’t come better than that.” \nFerentz is talking about Angerer’s impact on a football team. And on Brett Greenwood. \n* * * \nBrett Greenwood, with former Iowa defensive coordinator Norm Parker.

It was another day of rehab, and the goal today was Greenwood’s right leg. It wasn’t as strong as his left leg. Angerer and Rokes knew the competitiveness that had turned Greenwood from a walk-on to an All-Big Ten team captain was still there. They tapped into it. \nThat first day, Angerer watched him at rehab, Greenwood was trying to remember how to put one foot in front of the other. He had collapsed on Sept. 9, 2011: His heart stopped while working out at Pleasant Valley High School and his brain was denied oxygen and then doctors putting him into a medically induced coma for 27 days, and here it was three years later and Greenwood was still trying to walk between parallel bars. \nAngerer walked behind him. Doyel: Behind scenes at Hoops Hall, witnessing bids for immortality \n“Rokes was like, ‘Back off, let him do it,’ and Brett dominated the parallel bars,” Angerer says. “We moved to the walker; he dominated the walker. He’s the type of guy you have to constantly send the bar, challenge. He’s so talented and motivated, you’ve just got to challenge him because he’ll conquer it.” \nAnd so it was, a few months ago, that Greenwood slid into the leg-press machine, set it to his right leg only, and tried to lift 20 pounds. \nDone. \nRokes and Angerer put on 40 pounds. Done. They switched the setting to both legs and continued. Didn’t ask Greenwood. Just kept adding weight. \n“We got to 400 pounds,” Angerer is telling me, practically screaming over the phone from his home in Iowa. “We got the whole rack on there. He dominated it!” \nIt gave Pat Angerer an idea. And a future. \n* * * \n“You always hear how (retirement) is hard, it’s tough, and I was like, ‘Whatever,’ ” Angerer was saying. \n“But it was. My whole life I’d been training for this — this game — and then all of a sudden you’re done. You’re some random guy, you know? And that’s kind of where Brett came in and saved me a little bit. He gave me that thing to look forward to, to be around, to fight for and train for, to get better, to look forward to. He got me through a lot of stuff just by watching him compete. He kind of saved me.” \nAngerer says he, Rokes and Greenwood “are like a little family,” and they have plans: opening a fitness facility of their own. Angerer will be a personal trainer. Rokes will be the physical therapist and is a certified strength and conditioning coach. \n“We’re looking for sites,” Angerer says. \nBut first, the Pittsburgh game. Doyel: He watched Milan Miracle — one row behind bench \nFerentz wanted Greenwood to lead the Hawkeyes onto the field before the game Sept. 19 against the visiting Panthers. For five months, Greenwood, Angerer and Rokes trained for it. Their crew went to the Iowa football facility, to the 77-yard turf field next to the weight room, and they practiced walking. At first it took Greenwood almost five minutes to walk those 77 yards. \nFive months later he led the Hawkeyes onto the field at Kinnick Stadium, the crowd roaring. With Angerer wearing Greenwood's No. 30 jersey and talking into his right ear — Don’t cross over that left foot. Keep that right hip square — Greenwood covered those 35 yards in about 25 seconds . \n“He dominated it,” Angerer said. “He sprinted that thing.” \nNext goal? Greenwood, who moved in with his parents in 2011, wants to live alone. Then there’s working, the fitness facility, living a life that doctors tried to end in 2011 when they advised Greenwood’s parents to bring their brain-damaged boy home, turn off the machines and let nature take its course. \nGreenwood’s parents refused. His physical therapist called Angerer for help. And here we are, two ex-Hawkeyes drawing strength from each other. \n“Brett certainly benefited greatly from Pat — and I think Brett has helped Pat,” says longtime Iowa strength coach Chris Doyle. “They continue to polish each other and help one another in the journey.” \nNonsense, Angerer says. \n“I don’t do much,” the former Colts linebacker says. “I just hang out with a friend and watch him kick ass.” \nFind Star columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/gregg.doyel .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:36:48.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
