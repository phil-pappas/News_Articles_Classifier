Safe as houses under the high ball. More than capable replacement for the injured Israel Folau. 8. \nADAM ASHLEY-COOPER: Bagged Australia’s first try and had a big hand in another in typically solid performance from the vice-captain. 7. \nTEVITA KURIDRANI: Enjoyed his best match of the tournament, scoring a desperately-needed late five-pointer after setting up the opener. His midfield metres were critical. 8. \nMATT GITEAU: Celebrated his 100th Test with a man-of-the-match showing. Provided a cool head in a crisis and made several crucial tackles. 8. \nDREW MITCHELL: Had limited attacking opportunities but collected a double to close within one try of the World Cup record shared by Jonah Lomu and Bryan Habana. 7.5. \nBERNARD FOLEY: Rescued the Wallabies from an embarrassing loss with pressure-filled last-gasp penalty goal but otherwise was below par. 7. \nWILL GENIA: Organised the Wallabies well, earned a vital second-half penalty and can’t be blamed at all for teammates at times running around like headless chooks. 7.5. \nBEN MCCALMAN: Australia’s most inspirational forward in the absence of star flanker David Pocock. Got through a mountain of work to give coach Cheika food for thought. 8. \nMICHAEL HOOPER: Returned from a one-match ban and wasn’t his usual effective self at the breakdown as Scotland attacked the rucks with two pilferers. 7. \nSCOTT FARDY: Played the full 80 minutes once more but looked jaded from Australia’s sapping pool matches. 6.5. \nKANE DOUGLAS: His physical presence was vital once again as the Wallabies struggled for superiority. 7. \nROB SIMMONS: Caught napping at the breakdown for Scotland’s opening try and generally had a match to forget. 5.5. \nSEKOPE KEPU: Scrummaged and tackled strongly on a tough day out for Australia’s set piece. 6.5. \nSTEPHEN MOORE: Made a courageous captain’s call not to shoot for points in the shadows of halftime and was rewarded with a priceless five-pointer to Hooper. 7. \nSCOTT SIO: Conceded multiple penalties as the Wallabies scrum copped a reality check from the inspired Scots and also played a part in leaking Australia’s first try. 5.5. \nKEY RESERVES \nNICK PHIPPS: Provided enthusiasm after being injected into the final 10 minutes. 6. \nJAMES SLIPPER: Would have been forever haunted for throwing the pass for Scotland’s late intercept try that almost cost the Wallabies a semi-final spot. 4. \nGREG HOLMES: Added stability to Australia’s scrum after replacing Sio with 27 minutes remaining. 7. \nTATAFU POLOTA-NAU: Missed a tackle but otherwise did a satisfactory job deputising for Moore late. 6.
