(Video via KSTP )\n\"I hope I come out guns blazing,\" Greg Hardy said .\nThough Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Greg Hardy has done the opposite after returning from domestic abuse charges.\nAlthough there have been rumors that teams are interested in Rice, there aren't any reports of him working out for one yet. Until then, Rice will remain a free agent.\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/writer/jason-la-canfora/25343562/nfl-would-support-comeback-bid-for-running-back-ray-rice", "http://dfw.cbslocal.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6M12ifwB50", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIv00FjdRnE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbwTMJroTbI"], "published": "2015-10-18T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:39:25.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
