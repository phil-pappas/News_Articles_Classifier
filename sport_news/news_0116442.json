Show Caption Previous Next \nCLINTON — DeShea Phillips still chuckles at the \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" that her son Mason spurs on the football field. \nAnderson County High School's sophomore running back has forced them out of spectators' mouths for years. \n\"I'll never forget this,\" DeShea said. \"We were going through the gate before a little league championship game against Oak Ridge. Mason was 5 or 6 years old, and this (small) crowd of men were against the fence. \n\"It was raining. As we entered, all they said was ‘There he is.' They knew once he hit that outside, he was gone. Sure enough, Mason had three or four touchdowns and the game-winner.\" \nThat reputation has followed the now 5-foot-10, 180-pound starting running back through middle school and into high school, a shirttail on a hard-fought success story. \nMason was diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastoma as an infant. \nTumors, once cancerous but now dormant, attacked his retinas, prompting aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatments and shredding the integrity of his right eye. \nThe socket has been filled with a prosthetic eye since he was 2 years old. Yet, he'll line up Thursday as the Mavericks (3-4, 1-2 Region 2-4A) try to bolster their playoff resume against division co-leader and visiting Central (TV: MyVLT, 7 p.m.). \n\"The best thing about Mason running the ball is his vision,\" Anderson County coach Davey Gillum said. \"He has just done it so much, it's natural. He waits for his blocks and spins and cuts. \n\"It is ironic how good his vision is as a ball carrier.\" \n‘Deer in headlights' \nMason, 16, was born Sept. 3, 1999, a minute before fraternal sister Madison. \nFive pounds, zero ounces and the youngest son among DeShea and Mickey's three children. Mason appeared healthy initially, despite being delivered five weeks early. \n\"He was probably two or three months old when we first noticed the lazy (right) eye, and we could see white specks in his eye,\" said DeShea, her eyes welling with tears. \"I took him to the doctor one day, his older brother Bryson was 3 at that time. We've got two 6-month old babies, and the doctor said, ‘We've got something really serious here. Your baby has cancer.' \" \nThe white specks were tumors. \nFurther testing revealed Mason's bilateral retinoblastoma, a rare disease that is predominantly found in children. Retinoblastomas affect an estimated 280 people per year, according to a 2014 study by the American Cancer Society. In Mason's case, three tumors were found in his left eye, and two larger masses were discovered in his right. The cancer was considered Stage 4B, necessitating aggressive treatment and leaving an unfavorable chance of preserving vision. \n\"I don't remember any of it,\" Mason said. \nNeither does DeShea. \nThe initial appointment was on a Friday, and testing was performed at University of Tennessee Medical Center. The family arrived at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis the following day. Everything in between was a blur. \n\"Me and my husband were so young, it was like deer in headlights,\" DeShea said. \"We had no idea what was going on. It was like a whirlwind.\" \nDoctors attached a chemoport to the right side of Mason's chest shortly after his arrival at St. Jude's, and promptly began chemotherapy. Plaque radiotherapy, which attacks tumors with radioactive seeds over a few days, was performed on his right eye, and more radiation followed to contain and mitigate the cancer. \nNearly a year of treatment followed before Mason went into remission. \n\"Radiation is actually what killed his right eye,\" DeShea said. \"The cancer was gone, but where we had done so much treatment on the eye, the doctor said when he went to remove the right eye, it just collapsed. \n\"It was dead.\" \n‘nothing to be scared of' \nSitting in Anderson County's football locker room last Sunday, Madison couldn't help but laugh. \n\"Mason is always cracking jokes,\" the Mavericks' cheerleader said. \"He always has something to say. I hear about how he's a minute older than me all the time.\" \nDeShea remembers the eye exams nurses would administer during elementary and middle school. One nurse would check for a response in both of Mason's eyes, then casually whisper for another nurse. Eventually, they called in a supervisor. \nMason, meanwhile, kept form, holding back a smile. \n\"The teachers would be just rolling,\" DeShea said. \"The supervisor would come up and Mason would say, ‘I have a prosthetic eye.' And she would say, ‘Oh, thank God.' \" \nThe humor is a byproduct of Mason's health, a non-issue since he went into remission at 18 months. \nHis left eye requires frequent lubricating drops, and his prosthetic, a painted concave piece of sea coral that's attached to his optical muscles, must be cleaned every six months. \n\"When my left eye moves, my right eye moves,\" Mason said. \nThe three tumors remain in his left eye, which is light sensitive, and he has 20/40 vision while wearing his black-framed polycarbonate glasses. The family still treks to St. Jude's every six months for check-ups. \n\"I think about the future every so often,\" Mason said, \"but I'm really living in the moment right now.\" \nDoctors have estimated Mason has a 40 percent chance of being diagnosed with a second cancer during adulthood. \nThe 2014 study by the American Cancer Society cited an increased risk of bone and soft tissue sarcomas and melanoma. \n\"I don't really think of it as something to be scared about,\" Mason said. \"I've fought it once and defeated it once. When we go down (to St. Jude's) for the checkup, I see it as a vacation because I see all the doctors that I've always had. It's fun to see all my old doctors. It can be sad, because you see all the kids there. It can be depressing, but it's bittersweet at the same time.\" \nit comes natural \nIt became a ritual of hope for DeShea and Mickey during Mason's treatments. \nThey would lay in bed with Mason and Madison between them, praying for their youngest son's health to improve. \n\"Why not us?\" said DeShea, her eyes welling again. \"It is what it is. We grabbed arms and we prayed every night. And He answered them all. \n\"I asked God just to give us Mason. It didn't matter how, but not take him. I got more than what I asked for.\" \nOn Thursday, Mason, will try to tap into the skill set that made him the subject of so much sideline chatter as a youngster. \nHe doesn't wear glasses or contacts on the field, just a yellow visor that nixes the affect of stadium lights. \nHe cocks his head side to side more than most when reading a defense. \nIt's hard to tell the difference between him and the area's other promising runners, otherwise. \nJust listen for the \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" for proof. \n\"We watched him in little league,\" Gillum said. \"He has always been one of the best players in his age groups since he was itty bitty, and really it hasn't been close.\" \nMason is the third in his immediate family to play football for Anderson County, joining Mickey (1986) and Bryson (2014). \nHe has rushed for 601 yards and nine touchdowns on 117 carries this season, navigating a front-loaded schedule that included state-ranked Fulton, Greeneville and Oak Ridge. \nHis crescendo came against rival Clinton in Week 6, when rushed for 298 yards and five touchdowns, three of which came in the fourth quarter as the Mavericks rallied from a 21-point halftime deficit to stun the Dragons 51-47. \n\"I run the ball as hard as I can,\" Mason said. \"It just comes natural. I don't really think about what I'm going to do. I just do it.\" \nChris Thomas covers high school sports. Follow him at twitter.com/prepxtra. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
