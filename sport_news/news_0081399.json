It's a four-hour flight so, if a player gets ill, I have the other player in my environment.\" \nAntonio Valencia and Sergio Romero missed the win at Goodison Park because they had long-haul flights after the international break, but both look likely to travel to Russia. \n\"Of course that was the reason [Romero and Valencia were absent at Everton],\" the Dutchman added. \n\"They have to cope with the jet-lag so I didn't think it was wise to take them with us against Everton.\" \nUnited fly to the Russian capital on Tuesday afternoon before taking on CSKA the following day.
