Squash, bowling and wushu all missed out .\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) will make the final decision next year on which sports will be accepted for Tokyo, choosing from the five that were recommended.\n\"I don't believe we could have done more to get our message across to both the Tokyo 2020 Games hosts and the IOC how Squash could bring something special as an addition to the Programme,\" WSF President Narayana Ramachandran said in a statement.\n\"I know I speak on behalf of the millions of squash players around the world for whom the opportunity of seeing their sport participate in the Olympics has been an absolute priority - and, like me, they will be heartbroken.\"\nSquash, played in more than 185 countries, was one of three sports shortlisted for full inclusion at the Tokyo Olympics when the IOC voted on the programme at its 125th Session in Buenos Aires two years ago.\nWrestling won that vote for inclusion ahead of baseball/softball and squash but the losers were thrown a lifeline when the IOC later decided that future Olympic host cities could select extra sports they wanted to see contested at the Games.\n\"However, this is not the end for squash,\" added Ramachandran.\n\"Our sport, played by vast numbers week in and week out, flourishes at every level from recreational to events around the world.\n\"We will go from strength to strength while we continue to target participation at a future date in the Games.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-29T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:20:46.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
