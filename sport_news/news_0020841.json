Manziel was pulled over by Avon, Ohio, police after a witness said a person was trying to jump from the quarterback's speeding vehicle. Manziel admitted drinking before the incident, but police didn't charge him. Manziel spent 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehab facility during the offseason for treatment of an unspecified condition. The Browns said they are aware of the incident. The former Heisman Trophy winner started and won one game for the Browns this season. He's currently backing up starter Josh McCown. Manziel made two starts last year during a turbulent rookie season.
