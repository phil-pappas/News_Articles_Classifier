The senior defensive end often practices for his seemingly inevitable future in television.\nBut there was Jack Allen after Tuesday's practice, pushing a Gatorade bottle into Calhoun's face as if it were a microphone. The senior center had just finished practicing at his temporary position, left tackle.\n\"There's rumors today going around practice that you kind of got beat up by that left tackle out there,\" Allen said to Calhoun. \"Can you talk about that and tell everyone what's going on?\"\nAt this rate, Allen will have done it all by the time the season is finished.\n\"You can put him out at tight end,\" MSU offensive line coach Mark Staten said, \"and give him a week of prep. ...\"\nThink that's ridiculous?\nIt's ridiculous that a center listed at 6-feet-2 — Staten said 6-1 is probably generous — could move outside to left tackle and play a half of solid football there in a Big Ten game. That's not a natural position switch. It's like moving a 5-11 point guard to center in basketball.\nBut that's what Allen, a 2014 All-America, did Saturday against Purdue with MSU missing its starting left tackle and backup because of injuries.\n\"Yeah, I've never had our center go out to play left tackle,\" MSU coach Mark Dantonio said.\n\"No,\" MSU co-offensive coordinator Dave Warner said when asked if he'd ever seen anything like that in his 32 years of coaching. \"No. No, I haven't. Never. Never.\"\nStaten concurred, and that's a statement on what MSU has in Allen. It's also one of the positive stories of a wobbly first five games for the No. 4 Spartans entering Saturday's game at Rutgers: MSU's offensive line might be banged up and scrambling to adjust, but at least Allen's highlight tape for NFL scouts is blowing up.\n\"You'd have to go back a long time,\" NFL draft analyst Dane Brugler said, to find a player of Allen's physical dimensions playing left tackle for a high-major college football team that doesn't run an option offense exclusively.\n\"The fact that he was able to do that, not flawlessly, but the fact he was able to kick outside like that when his team needed him shows what kind of player he is,\" said Brugler, an analyst for NFLDraftScout.com and CBSSports.com. \"Not only on the field but in terms of preparation. That's a ton of preparation. You just don't see 6-1 centers like that kick outside and play left tackle.\"\nAllen projects as a middle-round pick in the 2016 draft, Brugler said, but this display of versatility can only help him. And there may be more ahead for the 296-pounder.\nAllen would actually rank left tackle fifth of the five offensive line positions in terms of his comfort level. He has been a center most of his career and has played guard extensively, but he'd really like to try some right tackle — and if starting right tackle Kodi Kieler (knee) returns Saturday and starting left tackle Jack Conklin (knee) can't, Kieler may get some work on the left side and allow Allen to switch to the right.\nAt some point soon, MSU expects to get both back. Allen will happily move back to center for a line that should benefit from the necessary plunge into position switches and young reserves.\n\"When those guys come back it's gonna add some serious depth,\" Allen said, \"and we'll be able to push people all over.\"\nAnd if Rutgers is another Band-Aid game, Allen will be ready. The main reason players of his stature don't play tackle, especially left tackle, is because of the height and wing span necessary to block defensive ends in pass protection. Yet Allen did not look out of place on the edge Saturday.\n\"When you compete and you're nasty and you love the game of football and you understand the game of football, there's not a whole lot you can't do,\" Staten said. \"And Jack's that kind of guy. For Jack to do what he did, against a solid front, and still be able to stay on them, he's just a competitive guy. So he's not going to allow himself to not be prepared. He's a special guy.\"\nHe's also a former wrestling state champ at Hinsdale (Ill.) Central, and that's no small factor here.\n\"It's huge, really,\" Allen said. \"It's almost like a wrestling stance where you're reacting laterally and you're not going straight at guys. Wrestling is a lot of lateral movement, side to side, hand fighting, and that's what it is out there (at tackle).\"\nAll that space may be lonely to some. For a guy who never even played tackle in little league, who has been centering and taking instant, direct hits for several years, it's \"kind of nice.\"\n\"You're used to just kind of kicking back and getting hit right in the face,\" Allen said. \"Or you're blocking a guy and you just get ear-holed. So you get more space out there.\"\nAllen even stymied the All-America pass rusher, Calhoun, on at least one play in practice. And then he tried to interview him about it.\n\"What was your name again?\" Calhoun responded to Allen's question.\nMore and more people are finding out.\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com.
