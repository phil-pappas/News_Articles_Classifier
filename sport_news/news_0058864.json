As a last resort, the government amended the Private Medical Educational Institution (Regulation of Admission and fixation of Fee) Act 2006 to make it mandatory for all private medical institutions to seek affiliation from the HPU. The government had, on several occasions in the past, asked the MMMC to get affiliation from the HPU as per the conditions mentioned in the essentiality certificate. It had pointed out that the Maharshi Markendeshwar University (Kumarhatti) was not empowered to affiliate any college but it remained adamant and did not comply with the orders of the government. After bitter experience with the MMMCH, the government has decided to amend the sub-section (6) of section (3) of the HP Private Medical Institutions (Regulation of Admission and fixation of Fee) Act 2006 by inserting a new clause which said that “in order to ensure common standards for maintaining the excellence of medical education in the state, only the HPU shall have the exclusive powers to affiliate private medical colleges set up in the state,” Health Minister Kaul Singh Thakur said. The Medical Council of India (MCI) had issued a letter of permission to the MMMC to admit 150 students each in the first and second batches of the MBBS for 2013-14 and 2014-15. This year again it allowed admissions to the third batch of MBBS in spite of letters written by the government to the MCI that the “affiliation of the college with MMU is illegal and in contravention of the law.” The government was left with no option except to amend the relevant Act. The state government even nominated the Principal of the MMMC as its nomination in the MCI. In spite of the request of the government to remove him as government nominee, no action has been taken by the MCI. The MMMC did not agree on centralised counseling for admissions during 2013-14 and 2014-15 but this time the government insisted that admissions to all the medical and dental colleges, including by the MMMC, would be made through centrallised counseling and all the admissions to the MBBS under the state and management quota were made through centralised counseling under the chairmanship of Director, Medical Education. Further, the MCI curtailed 33 seats under the management quota and added these to the state quota for this year. As a result, 108 admissions were made under state quota, 36 under management quota and six under the NRI quota this year. The HP Private Educational Institutions Regulatory Commission has also asked the College to put biometric system in place to ensure that the faculty was physically present.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:31:20.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
