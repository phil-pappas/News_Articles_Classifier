That means Major League Baseball playoffs and also a college football season starting to gain some momentum.\nFor No. 7/5-ranked LSU , it also means it's back to work in conference play with a trip to South Carolina up next (11 a.m. Saturday | ESPN).\nThe Tigers (4-0, 2-0 SEC) have grinded through two less-than-spectacular performances -- except for Leonard Fournette and the offensive line -- to clip Syracuse and Eastern Michigan. You get the sense they might be a little more fired up to take on the Gamecocks (2-3, 0-3), who are off to their worst league start since 2005.\nJump in for a chat at 11 a.m. Monday and we'll briefly look back at the 44-22 win against EMU and turn the focus to the first road trip to Columbia, S.C., since 2008.\nAlso, with the LSU basketball team beginning practice on Monday and the baseball Tigers going through the paces of fall practice, the menu is wide open. Don't be shy about throwing out questions on those two fronts.\nSome basic guidelines:\n1) Treat everybody in the chat the way you want to be treated. No name-calling, no hyper-criticizing of opinions, etc. Make your point, step back and let the discussion begin and/or continue. Understand that others have every right to make theirs and keep the discourse on an adult level. And please don't regurgitate the same comments over and over again and that includes from previous chats. Keep it fresh.\n2) Speaking for me and only me, I am not a coach or college athlete basher. Coaches know a lot more about what they're doing than me or any other media member, just like we know a lot more about being sports writers or broadcasters than they do. You can disagree all you want with what a coach says or does, but understand I will base my opinions and responses to you on the basis that I believe they know A LOT more about their craft than you do and know their personnel better than you or me. He/she usually has a very good reason for what they do.\n3) We can talk about whatever you want, but understand I am not here to commiserate with you, nor will I allow personal attacks on anybody. I am a sports fan, but I cover LSU sports. That's an important distinction to embrace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:35:23.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
