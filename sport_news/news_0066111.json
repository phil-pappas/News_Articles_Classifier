Park, the winner last year at Miramar, skipped her title defense to play in a Korea LPGA event. \nAt 18 years, 6 months, 1 day, Ko is the youngest player to win 10 events on any major tour. \nKo finished at 20-under 268 after opening with rounds of 69, 67 and 67 to take a four-stroke lead into the final day. South Koreans So Yeon Ryu and Eun-Hee Ji tied for second. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:01:06.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
