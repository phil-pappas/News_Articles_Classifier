Michal Jordan will take Wisniewski’s spot next to John-Michael Liles Saturday against Detroit. \nThe team also called up Danny Biega from Charlotte with the need for an extra defenseman. In sports, injury creates opportunity. Bill Peters thinks that the young defensemen on the Hurricanes roster will step up and take advantage. \n“In Michal Jordan, Murph (Ryan Murphy) and (Noah) Hanifin now they know they are going to be in the lineup and they are counted on heavily,\" Peters said. \"I think we are fine, I think we will be okay with this.” \nThis is a tough loss for the Hurricanes, not just on the blue line but to the power play. Wisniewski was quarterbacking the second unit and his skills will be tough to replicate for a team trying to generate offense. \nThat void needs to be filled which creates a big chance for Murphy to contribute on the man-advantage. Murphy producing points from the back end is something that Bill Peters needs to see from the fourth-year pro. \n“That’s how he made his mark as a junior and early in his career here on the power play so now he gets a good power play opportunity and he has to capitalize on it,” Peters said. \nPeters also noted that he wants Wisniewski to stay around the team, saying that when ready, the injured defenseman will accompany the team on road trips and be seen in the locker room. Shift Change Eric Staal will move back to the wing Saturday, but not with younger brother Jordan. The Canes captain is playing on the wing of Victor Rask, opposite Elias Lindholm tonight in the home opener. \nCam Ward will get his second consecutive start in net despite his shaky first period Thursday night in Nashville.
