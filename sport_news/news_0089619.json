The White Sox had put together a potent lineup and added Jeff Samardzija to join Chris Sale in leading the rotation.\nThe Royals had spent years landing prime talent high in the draft and now those players were in their prime. And the Cleveland Indians had found themselves on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s Baseball Preview as the team to watch in 2015.\nThe Twins were 1-6, and facing 69 more games against an AL Central that seemed to be more potent than it ever had appeared in the two decades since baseball went to three divisions per league.\nOne week in, that eight ball facing the Twins seemed roughly the size of Minnesota Fats' head. And you could hear the rest of the Central saying:\n“Fast Paulie … let’s play some pool.’’\n***\nOn that day off, April 11, newcomers to the roster found apartments, while Molitor studied such decisions as to whether play Jordan Schafer or Shane Robinson in center field, and where to put designated hitter Kennys Vargas and left fielder Oswaldo Arcia in the batting order.\nThe sporting public didn’t much care. The Wild was two days from the start of the playoffs against St. Louis. The heroic lads from St. Paul had played so well once goalie Devan Dubnyk showed up there were visions of a long playoff run.\nThe Twins? The official attendance went from the traditional Opening Day sellout (40,123) to 21,362 for the second home game.\nIt was April 11, there were 155 games remaining and Minnesota’s disillusioned baseball fans were already looking at a fifth straight long summer.\n***\nOne hundred and 73 days later, the Twins were in Cleveland for the final road game of the season on Thursday night. There was the usual late-season smattering of customers in Cleveland, which has become home to the lousiest fan base in America.\nOn this cool night, the Twins – Molitor’s astounding, pitching-short collection of survivors – were down to their final chance to escape from behind that eight ball.\nTyler Duffey, the out-of-nowhere, rookie savior of the rotation, had again dealt wonderfully for six shutout innings. And then in the seventh, he grooved a fastball to Roberto Perez, Cleveland’s hard-swinging catcher, and the result was a two-run home run to center field.\nSo, the Twins trailed 2-1 into the eighth, and a loss would put them two games out of the second wild-card position with three to play, and realistically put an end to the improbable postseason push.\nAnd then Molitor made a move, sending up Danny Santana to pinch-hit for Kurt Suzuki. Santana walked, something he had done five times in 271 previous plate appearances in the big leagues this season.\nSo, there was Santana at first with all that speed, and there was Eduardo Escobar – Danny’s mid-season replacement at shortstop – slapping a double that bounced to the left-field corner to score him.\nSlump-ridden Brian Dozier followed with an infield single. Tie game, first-and-third, one out, and here was Joe Mauer.\nAll Twins’ followers had the same thought – 4-6-3 – but Joe couldn’t do that again, not here, not with the run needed to keep the Twins breathing into the final weekend in Target Field standing at third.\nCould he?\nOh, yeah. Hard bouncer to second, 4-6-3, and it stays 2-2.\nDepression isn’t often visible on Mauer when he fails, but it was here. This was a low moment for everyone with a stake in the Twins.\nFor 173 days, they had been rallying from low moments.\nCould they do it again?\nOh, yeah. They scored twice in the ninth, on Cleveland mistakes and the dash of the excellent extra player, Eduardo Nunez, and then they got another save from Kevin Jepsen.\nThey headed back home for three with Kansas City -- with Santana on the mound for the series opener and managerial dart-throwing for starters for the rest of the weekend.\nThe Royals are the runaway champs of the Central and still playing for the home-field edge in the playoffs.\nIt was never going to be easy for the Twins, not after six months behind the eight ball, but there’s still a chance, so what do you say:\n“Fast Paulie … let’s play some pool.’’\nOlder Post 'Power Five' conference change favors SEC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:30:50.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
