With the loss, Topeka (7-7-0) earned a series split with Springfield, after winning 5-0 Friday. \n“We took a very unfortunate penalty there late in the second period, and it cost us the game,” RoadRunners coach Scott Langer said. \nForward Trevor Stone scored his first of two power-play goals at 1:08 of the third period to make it a two-goal lead for Springfield. \nWith 1:16 still remaining in Hayes’ penalty, Stone made it 3-0. \nStill on the man advantage, defenseman Kyle Meeh knocked home a loose rebound past goaltender Tyler Johnson shortly thereafter, giving the Jr. Blues a commanding 4-0 advantage. \nAll four Jr. Blues goals were on the power play, as Springfield went 4 for 5 with the man advantage. \n“When you’re killing long penalties like that, it kills your energy level,” Langer said. “Last night, we did a lot of things right. Tonight, it was the complete opposite. \nForward Matt Jennings broke the shutout for goaltender Niko Della Maggorie with a power-play goal at the 9:40 mark, but it was too little too late for Topeka. \n“You’ve got to give yourself a chance to sweep a series like this, and we did not,” Langer said. \nSpringfield capitalized early to open the scoring. \nForward Petr Kuznetsov fired in a power-play goal at 6:48 of the first, making it 1-0 Springfield. \nThe Jr. Blues narrowly missed a 2-0 lead just over a minute later, with a shot clanking off the crossbar. \nTopeka’s first power play of the night garnished several good chances, including a shot from the doorstep by forward JB Baker, but Maggorie kept the Runners off the board. \nThe second period brought more balanced hockey, with Springfield looking to extend its lead and Topeka looking to find an equalizer. \nWhile the second period did not bring a goal, it did bring the game-changing moment late in the frame, with Hayes penalty at 18:55. \nTopeka now hits the road to face the Ice Rays on Oct. 22 and 24 in Corpus Christi, Texas. \nSpringfield (7-3-1) 1 0 3 — 4 \nTopeka (7-7-0) 0 0 1 — 1 \nFirst period — 1.
