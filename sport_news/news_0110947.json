Don’t look now, Boston Red Sox fans, but it turns out your dream could have been a reality.\nAdChoices The Red Sox reportedly could have traded for Miami Marlins star right fielder Giancarlo Stanton a couple of years ago, ESPN Boston’s Gordon Edes reported, but there was one catch: They’d have to give up shortstop Xander Bogaerts.\nThe Marlins had a similar request for the Baltimore Orioles, asking for third baseman Manny Machado in return. But both teams obviously held tight, and the Red Sox got a sign Wednesday that they probably made the right choice.\nBogaerts, who turned 23 on Thursday, singled in the first inning of Wednesday’s 9-5 win over the New York Yankees, passing Ted Williams for most hits by a Red Sox player before his 23rd birthday with 194. That total also was tied with Houston Astros second baseman Jose Altuve for most in the American League heading into Thursday’s game.\nEdes also pointed out there have been just seven players in the last 40 years to have as many hits as Bogaerts at age 22 or younger, and it’s a pretty elite list. Starlin Castro, Miguel Cabrera, Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, Cal Ripken Jr., Garry Templeton and George Brett were the last to do it. Brett and Ripken are Hall-of-Famers, and a couple of those guys might join them someday.\nBogaerts was batting .323 with 81 RBIs and 42 extra-base hits heading into Thursday’s game, so at the end of the day, it looks as though the Red Sox made the right call in holding on to him.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://nesn.com/2015/09/red-sox-wrap-boston-wins-9-5-in-extras-spoils-yankees-chance-to-clinch/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/47363/source-red-sox-once-could-have-had-giancarlo-stanton-but-it-would-have-cost-xander-bogaerts"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:29:20.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
