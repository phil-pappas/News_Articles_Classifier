He's aspired to be part of this iconic endurance event since he completed his first Ironman-distance triathlon in 2006.\nJones, the president and CEO of the Dallas Convention & Visitor's Bureau, earned his spot through Kona's Legacy Program, which entitles loyal Ironman participants to race Kona once in their lifetime.\n\"I've been working on getting to Kona for 10 years,\" Jones said. \"After 15 Ironman races, I finally made it.\"\nTo be eligible, Jones had to complete at least 12 full Ironman-branded events, have never started the Ironman World Championships and have completed at least one Ironman event in 2013, 2014 and 2015. He's among 100 Ironman Legacy winners this year including 64 Americans, 18 Australians, seven Canadians and four athletes from Great Britain. Other Legacy winners are from Singapore, Germany, New Zealand, Panama, Brazil and France.\nFor Jones, Hawaii is more than the completion of a long-term goal. It's an opportunity to raise awareness and funds for a personal cause: to eradicate Lyme Disease. Jones' 25-year-old son contracted the debilitating disease from a tick bite four years ago.\nJones is attempting to raise $14,060 for the Texas Lyme Disease Association. He said the disease is not well understood by the medical community, it's difficult to diagnose and can persist for years if it is not quickly and properly treated. There currently is not definitive blood test.\nClick here to donate to Jones' Ironman World Championship Fundraising effort to support the Texas Lyme Disease Association.\n\"I think I'm ready,\" he said. \"Hopefully, the Kona winds won't be too bad, and the heat and humidity don't destroy me.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @DFWRunning", "external_links": ["https://www.crowdrise.com/2015IronmanWorldChampionship/fundraiser/phillipjones", "https://twitter.com/DFWRunning"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:41:39.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
