City health officials do not believe the clusters are connected.\nThe earlier outbreak was traced to Legionella bacteria found inside the cooling tower of a Bronx hotel, prompting sweeping new regulations requiring the frequent inspection of the city's cooling towers. All the towers in the Bronx were cleaned in the weeks after the outbreak.\nBut the bacteria are found frequently in the towers, which use water to cool hot air being ventilated by buildings. Thirty-five cooling towers in Morris Park were sampled last weekend after the first diagnosis of this cluster was reported, officials said. Fifteen tested positive.\nThey are all being cleaned again, officials said. It has not yet been determined which tower - or towers - caused the new round of infection.\nThe identity of the deceased has not been released.\nOfficials tried to preach perspective about the new cluster, noting that all the current patients - including one who has already been released from the hospital - had underlying health concerns. Moreover, officials said that because all displayed symptoms before Sept. 21, which predates the normal seven-day incubation period, there is hope the cluster is already subsiding.\nAll cooling towers in the city now must be registered and cleaned because of legislation that was hurriedly passed after the previous deadly outbreak. A dispute over the speed and coordination of the cleanup in August became the latest front in the ongoing dispute between the administrations of Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nDe Blasio traveled to a Morris Park senior center Wednesday to reassure jittery residents that the disease can't be passed person to person and that the city was on top of the cleaning effort. He urged residents who may feel ill to seek medical attention since Legionnaires' disease, a form of pneumonia, is very treatable if caught in time.\n\"The danger is in not getting medical attention,\" the mayor said. \"That is the singular danger.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:28:35.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
