P. - 'MEMBERS ONLY' CLUB The Boo Williams Sportsplex in Hampton, VA was host to the Best of the 757 Basketball Showcase on Sunday, October 11, 2015. Over the years, the event has produced a wealth of talent from around the Hampton Roads area with the participants displaying their skills. There are always a handful of standouts from the event. Some of the noteworthy names on that lengthy list in the past include Troy Williams (Indiana), Anthony 'Cat' Barber (NC State), Devon Hall (UVA), Trey Freeman (ODU) and Ramone Snowden (JMU). Below, we highlight those that were named to this year's All-Camp Team, all of which ironically were underclassmen . . . 2015 Best of the 757 All-Camp Basketball Team: (as selected by the coaches) Cam Bacote , G, Bethel (2017) - - Known as the younger brother of former Bruins star and current Old Dominion wing Aaron Bacote when he arrived at Bethel, Cam had a breakout sophomore year as he put up 17 points per game to earn First Team All-Conference and Second Team All-Region honors. His savvy floor game sets him apart from others on the court. While Bacote doesn't overwhelm athletically, he impresses in other ways, particularly by being a heady, steady decision-maker that can create shots for himself or others. Seldom does he gets sped up too fast or out of control, and colleges have taken notice of his poise and smarts. The 6-foot-2 guard holds offers from Hampton, Howard, IUPUI, Mount St. Mary's and ODU so far. DeShaan Dixon, PF/C, Western Branch (2017) - - To me, Dixon was one of the surprises from the camp since he was relatively unknown coming in and wasn't a varsity player last year for Western Branch. By the event's conclusion, his motor that allowed him to block shots, track down long rebounds and run the floor like all big men should made him noticeable. Listed at 6-foot-3, 190 pounds, Dixon also plays on the football team for the Bruins at tight end and defensive end. If he's able to bring some toughness and aggressiveness from that sport over to the basketball court, it'll bolster the front-court for second-year Head Coach Paul Hall. Cameron Frazier, F, Hampton Roads Academy (2017) - - With the Navigators returning the core of their team in the form of perimeter pieces Bryan Hart, Anthony Picott and Devone Humphrey in Head Coach Chris Fuhrmann's second season at the helm, good things could be in store for the team moving forward. The 6-foot-3, 190-pound Frazier has a chance to be one of those x-factors as well. Another two-sport athlete that also plays football like Dixon, Frazier can bring them a big, strong body that develops into a presence on the inside. In a TCIS full of talented guards and wings, getting a contribution from someone in the post can be really influential in trying to stay near the top of the standings. Tommie Pope, G, Norcom (2018) - - Anyone that can start for the two-time defending State Champion Norcom Greyhounds as a freshman is good. Pope did that last season and brought some valuable qualities to the Portsmouth squad that is equipped for a three-peat run this winter. As his jumper continues to improve, look out because Pope will really start to give opponents - many of which will key in on talented teammates around him like Travis Fields, K.J. Davis and Travis Ingram - major fits. That's because he can get to the hoop with regularity, is a very pesky defender and has the kind of competitive streak in him that'll serve him well both at this level and beyond. Phillip 'P.J.' Roach, SG/SF, Cape Henry (2017) - - It was evident that few in attendance can jump with Roach. His 35.5-inch vertical jump was second best among all participants, only behind Tallwood's Tyree Golston . Furthermore, he's starting to use it to be an above-the-rim finisher. Roach was a reserve last year's Cape Henry team that captured its second state title in three seasons. At 6-foot-3, his length and leaping makes him a versatile option to play up to as many as possibly three different positions on the wing for Head Coach Mark Hall this winter. Dajour Rucker, F/C, Cape Henry (2019) - - A transfer to the Dolphins from Bayside, Rucker is an intriguing player that can be used as an inside-outside forward that's able to effect the game in a variety of ways. They'll look to drag him out and be that 'stretch-4,' type that is becoming more prevalent these days. Already 6-foot-5, Rucker has trimmed down and lost some of the unnecessary weight he previous had, which ought to help him considerably as far as his mobility goes. He's still learning how to assert himself at the offensive end of the floor, but progress has been made from our last viewing of him a year ago.
