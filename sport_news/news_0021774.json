We’d talked about it needing to be,” he said. \n“I’m very proud of the guys, especially the way at the start of the game we got into it and applied pressure. \n“All it’s done is earn ourselves another week. It’s exciting but we certainly won’t get ahead of ourselves.” \nNew Zealand unleashed clinical rugby in nearly every facet, shedding the handling errors and disjointed attack of the last month. \nRather than play conservatively in a sudden death match, they attacked with width and employed offloads to potent effect to routinely bust the French defensive line. \nTheir only concerns will be injuries to prop Wyatt Crockett (groin) and winger Nehe Milner-Skudder (shoulder), who didn’t contest the second half because of injuries. \nEarly penalties were traded between All Blacks five-eighth Dan Carter – who finished with 17 points – and French fullback Scott Spedding before lock Brodie Retallick scored New Zealand’s first try through a charge down. \nMilner-Skudder crossed before Savea bagged a double, barging spectacularly through two defenders on the stroke of halftime to open up a 29-13 lead. \nFrance’s lone try was scored by their muscular No.8 Louis Picamoles. \nThe French began the second half strongly but the wind went out of their sails when Picamoles was shown a yellow card for roughing up a prone All Blacks skipper Richie McCaw. \nThe All Blacks capitalised with a try to flanker Jerome Kaino, sparking a spate of scoring. \nSavea bagged his hat-trick in the 60th minute, storming 50m following a turnover to take his tournament tally to eight. \nA try to No.8 Kieran Read was followed by a double to reserve halfback Tawera Kerr-Barlow – one of which was via a memorable offload from prop Joe Moody. \nFrench captain Thierry Dusautoir says the All Blacks were outstanding although his team allowed them to be. \n“We were unable to play our game and they scored their tries too easily,” he said. \n“It’s a big disappointment to be out of the tournament this way but they were too strong for us. \n“They are very fast and every chance they have, they can score tries.” \nThe Springboks were involved in a far tighter contest on Saturday, needing a late try to beat Wales 23-19 at Twickenham. \nThe southern hemisphere giants haven’t met in a RWC knockout match since 2003, when the All Blacks won comfortably 29-9 in Melbourne.
