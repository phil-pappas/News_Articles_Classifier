Phillip) more > By KRISTIE RIEKEN - Associated Press - Sunday, October 11, 2015 \nHOUSTON (AP) - The Kansas City Royals were the darlings of last year’s postseason, making an unlikely run to the World Series. \nThis year, another young, exciting team is on the brink of sending them home. \nDallas Keuchel remained perfect at home with seven gutsy innings and Chris Carter homered Sunday, leading the Houston Astros to a 4-2 win over the Royals to take a 2-1 edge in the American League Division Series. \nThe Astros could wrap up the best-of-five matchup with a win over the defending AL champions in Game 4 on Monday. \n“You got to go out and win tomorrow,” manager Ned Yost said. “So, you just don’t have much leeway now, but our guys, I think, are up to the task and tomorrow will be an exciting day.” \nKeuchel, who shut down the Yankees in the AL wild-card game, worked out of jam after jam, allowing five hits and one run with seven strikeouts after going 15-0 at home this season, a modern major league record. \nYost knows just how good Keuchel is after tapping the lefty to start for the AL in this year’s All-Star game. \n“He threw a great game,” Yost said. “I think he should be the Cy Young winner this year. He’s been great. Had a phenomenal year.” \nLuke Gregerson gave up a leadoff homer in the ninth to Alex Gordon before finishing off the Astros first playoff game in Houston in 10 years with a four-out save. \nRoyals cleanup hitter Eric Hosmer, who is batting .083 in the playoffs, said their mindset is simple Win on Monday and force a Game 5 in Kansas City. \n“Every game is a must-win,” Hosmer said. “Obviously, it didn’t work out the way we wanted it today. We have to come back and do everything we can to win and take it back to Kansas City.” \nJason Castro drove in two runs with a single in the fifth that made it 2-1. Carlos Gomez, who has a rib muscle strain, started for the first time in the series and had an RBI single in the sixth. \nCarter’s soaring solo homer, which landed on the train tracks atop the wall in left-center, and came on Danny Duffy’s first pitch of the seventh pushed the lead to 4-1. \nCarter, batting .199 in the regular season but .455 in the postseason, was a triple shy of the cycle for the Astros, who were hosting a playoff game for the first time since the 2005 World Series. \nLorenzo Cain hit a solo homer in the fourth for the Royals, who were 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position and left 10 on base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:57:13.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
