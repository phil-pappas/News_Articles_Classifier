Offensive pass interference ... more > By MICHAEL MAROT - Associated Press - 12:08 a.m., Monday, October 19, 2015 \nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Tom Brady threw for 312 yards and three touchdowns and New England took advantage of a botched fake punt in the Patriots’ 34-27 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night. \nThe Patriots improved to 5-0 for the first time since 2007. It was the first meeting between the rivals since the “Deflategate” storm erupted after the AFC title game in January. \nFor a half, the teams traded jabs. \nBut New England seized control in the second half. \nBrady’s 25-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowksi gave New England a 27-21 lead. And when the Patriots stopped the Colts (3-3) on an odd-looking and ill-advised fake punt, the scrambling Brady eventually found LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard scoring pass that made it 34-21. \nAndrew Luck was 30 of 50 for 312 yards and three touchdowns in his first game back from an injured right shoulder. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:07:50.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
