Another loss for the Crimson Tide puts their national championship aspirations in serious peril. The Bulldogs, meanwhile, have a chance to make a statement both in the conference and nationally.\nThat same script, with some twists, could be applied to the Ole Miss-Florida game, with the Rebels as the team ready to jump both-feet style into the College Football Playoff hunt and Florida trying to regain a foothold in the SEC.\nBesides the SEC, the Big Ten opens the league season full bore, with No. 1-ranked Ohio State facing a tricky challenge in Bloomington, Indiana, of all places.\nHere is a rundown of '3 you need to see' and more:\n3 YOU NEED TO SEE\n(All times listed Central)\nSATURDAY\nNo. 13 Alabama at No. 8 Georgia, 2:30 p.m. (CBS)\nNo. 6 Notre Dame at No. 12 Clemson, 7 p.m. (ABC)\nNo. 3 Ole Miss at No. 25 Florida, 6 p.m. (ESPN)\nThe two divisions in the SEC will start to come into clearer view this weekend in Athens and Gainesville.\nLSU is sitting pretty with Ole Miss in the West right now, but that could be changed dramatically pending the outcomes in those games.\nNotre Dame 's Dexter Williams (34) carries the ball during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Massachusetts Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015, in South Bend, Ind.

Of course that only applies to Clemson since the Golden Domers still won't join the league full-time. But Notre Dame does have an attachment to the ACC's bowl pecking order, so winning on the road at Clemson would be a huge step in the right direction.\nThe Tigers are allowing only 12.3 points a game, but figure to be tested by an Irish offense that is purring with 41 points a contest â€“ 62 last week against FCS UMass.\nOTHER GAMES WORTH A LOOK\nSATURDAY\nNo. 23 West Virginia at No. 15 Oklahoma, 11 a.m. (FOX Sports 1)\nNo. 1 Ohio State at Indiana, 2:30 p.m. (ABC or ESPN2)\nTexas Tech at No. 5 Baylor. 2:30 p.m. (ABC or ESPN2)\nArkansas at Tennessee, 6 p.m. (ESPN)\nNo. 21 Mississippi State at No. 14 Texas A&M, 6:30 p.m. (SEC Network)\nIs Oklahoma going to be a legitimate threat to TCU and Baylor in the Big 12 Conference? Or could West Virginia slide in the back door in that league and be a darkhorse?\nThose questions will be answered when the two teams influenced by the Hal Mumme/Mike Leach school collide in Norman. Offense shouldn't be in short supply but which defense bows up could be the key.\nAnother Big 12 game in Waco figures to test the scoreboard as well. Texas Tech scored 52 points last week and lost and now faces Baylor, where touchdowns clearly grown on trees.\nOhio State running back Ezekiel Elliott plays against Western Michigan during an NCAA college football game Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015, in Columbus, Ohio.

IU knows how to score -- 38.3 points a game. However, they also struggle to stop opponents, with 32 allowed a contest.\nThe Buckeyes have muddled through the last two weeks against MAC foes, but you wonder if they won't flip the switch now a bit with Big Ten play beginning.\nWhile the marquee games in the SEC are listed above, don't sleep on Arkansas-Tennessee and Mississippi State-Texas A&M.\nIn Knoxville, the two preseason darlings among the SEC media collide in survival mode after both dropped heartbreakers in the conference openers last year.\nAnd the West showdowns are always intriguing, and in this case, both teams flexed some muscle last week to survive against Auburn and Arkansas, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:56:14.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
