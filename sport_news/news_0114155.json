(Jessica Hill / Associated Press) Edward Lee Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Rob Ambrose said Towson football knew Villanova would go for it on fourth down that led to game-winning INT. \nTowson’s 28-21 upset of No. 23 Villanova on Saturday night at Johnny Unitas Stadium turned on junior cornerback Romell Haley’s 86-yard interception return for a touchdown with 4:44 left in the game. \nCould Haley’s heroics have been avoided had the Wildcats gone for a field-goal attempt instead of a first down? Not according to Villanova coach Andy Talley — or Tigers coach Rob Ambrose. \nFaced with fourth down-and-9 at Towson’s 23, Talley could have sent freshman kicker Gerald Smith to attempt what would have been a 40- or 41-yard field goal to shave Towson’s lead to 21-17. But Smith’s longest field goal of his career with the Wildcats (3-4 overall and 2-2 in the Colonial Athletic Association) was 39 yards, and a 30-yard attempt in the second quarter had been blocked by Tigers redshirt senior Jon Desir. Smith’s backup, sophomore Steve Weyler, had missed all three of his attempts from less than 30 yards. \n“We’re not a great field-goal team right now,” Talley said. “We have a freshman kicking for us, and right now, I feel more confident — we have a sheet that we keep, [and] on fourth-and-less-than-5-or-6, depending on where we are, we’re going to go for it. We are planning all-out to win right now. I don’t have a lot of big-play kids at this point. Once we get the quarterback right, we’ll be on par.” \nThat quarterback, redshirt freshman Zach Bednarczyk, threw for a career-high 245 yards, but on that crucial fourth down, he was intercepted by Haley, who sprinted down the left sideline to give the Tigers (4-3, 2-2) an insurmountable 28-14 advantage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:44:16.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
