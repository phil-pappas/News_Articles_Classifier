Becnel wouldn't find the end zone against the Crabbers and finished with 55 yards on 22 attempts, picking up 47 of those yards in the second half with his team down by multiple scores. \"They're pretty familiar with him,\" Smith said of Becnel . \"His dad played for me and he played for us on J.V. He's a good running back, but we played against a pretty good one last week ( Jacione Fugate of Kecoughtan ). Fugate's a horse.\" Hampton would stretch its lead to 13 with 1:35 before half-time on Quillen's six-yard touchdown pass to Trequan Smith , their second score coming on third down. That was set up by linebacker Anton Brown's interception just a few plays prior. Phoebus would score on a 14-play, 90-yard drive that took 5:36 off the clock, capped by QB Justin Wright 's four-yard touchdown run. However, it came with only 4:28 remaining in the contest and only cut the Hampton lead to 12. The Crabbers would recover the subsequent onside kick try and not give the ball back to Phoebus. The last undefeated team standing in the PD, Hampton has its sights set bigger goals. They're pursuing a #1 seed in 5A-South on their quest to trying to bring home the storied program's first state title in ten years. Quillen stated. \"If we win the rest of these games out, all of our games are home for the playoffs. We just want to get everything here so we can go to the top.\" Perhaps the key to Hampton's dominant performance on defense and win was their defensive front. The d-line consisting of Elijah Conliffe , Keante ' Jones , Tyrique Coleman and Linwood Johnson limited Phoebus to 72 yards rushing on 32 attempts. Becnel or Wright that backed the Phoebus offense up. On the day, the Crabbers collected 10 tackles for loss, including two sacks. \"I thought they attacked more today than they have all year. That's one thing we've been trying to work on and thought they did a good job.\" was particularly effective playing on the inside next to Conliffe , a next-level recruit from the Class of 2017. He had 10 tackles, two for loss. I feel like this was the best I've played this whole season,\" Johnson admitted. We want to be one of those top Hampton teams and be a part of history. We haven't been here in a long time, and for me as a senior, this feels wonderful.\" Early in the second quarter, Quillen showed just how elusive and talented he is when it appeared he would get dropped for a loss back at his own 20-yard line, but spun out of three potential sacks to pick up five yards. Quillen quipped, in reference to the former star Crabbers quarterback and one of the most decorated players in VHSL history that later went on to play in the NFL. \"I've been watching highlights of that.This right here was for him, my team and my coaches. It's an emotional time for me right now, but I'm not going to get too emotional because I know I have to keep my head and move on to the next game.\" According to Smith, suffered a severely bruised thigh back on Tuesday. Plays such as the one that he made in turning a loss into a gain don't surprise those on the sidelines that have seen him make the ordinary play an extraordinary one. \"Bubba's just in his Clark Kent uniform right now.He's tough,\" Smith said. owe that toughness to? \"Coach Smith raised me, so I have to be tough,\" the Virginia Tech commit answered. According to Phantoms Head Coach Jeremy Blunt , Phoebus had several players sidelined on Saturday for disciplinary reasons. Among a couple of the key players unable to participate were WR/DB Elijah Nelson and RB Traonte Hamlin . Now 6-1 overall on the season, the Phantoms play host to Woodside (5-2), which has won three straight since a 36-20 loss to Hampton in September, on October 23rd at Darling Stadium.

Hampton now leads the all-time series 31-17. \"They've still got a long way to go to catch us,\" Smith pointed out.
