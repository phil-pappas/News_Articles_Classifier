I think they are the best sports documentaries out there. That being said, this USC one was one of the biggest cop outs I've ever seen on the series. it was 90mins long and they spent about 75 minutes detailing in great length the glory and success of USC and about 10 very brief minutes glazing over the controversy. Thank God Lendale White was a part of it because he was the ONLY one who told the truth and called out Pete Carroll for bailing on the program the second the sanctions were about to come down. Everyone else acted like USC did nothing wrong and Reggie did nothing wrong and the NCAA were just being haters. The Director even had a little clip before they got to the meat of this story and basically apologized like; Hey if we're telling this story we HAVE to include this part about the sanctions. They made me, dont get mad! lol This is why you dont let fans make documentaries. It is not like I am laying all the blame on USC. I think that the bulk of this documentary should have been spent exposing the hypocrisy of the NCAA, and the schools for creating the environment that leads to kids taking money and how hard it is to be in that world and stay clean. Maybe expose the fact that this happens in every major college football program and Reggie just happens to be the guy who got caught? Also regardless of all that, Reggie still broke the rules so he takes his share of the blame too, but its hard to blame any of these kids when the NCAA is making billions, BILLIONS off them all under the BS charade that they are equally compensated by their \"free education.\" Then again, why would ESPN ever go after the NCAA, they are as much a part of it as they are. This documentary never put ANY responsibility on Pete Carrol, the Athletic director or the university period. It really just glazed over it and was just a 90minute fluff piece about the glory days of USC even ending with the sentiment; It was all worth it and if they had to do it again they would do it the same... Whatever. Shame 30for30, shame. I thought you were better than this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:03:09.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
