(AP) - Four-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda has signed a four-year extension with the Baltimore Ravens. \nThe 31-year-old Yanda was in the final season of a contract he signed in 2011. \nYanda was a third-round pick out of Iowa by the Ravens in 2007. He started on Baltimore's 2012 Super Bowl champion team. \nHe has played in 120 games, including 109 starts, over nine NFL seasons. Only two offensive linemen - Hall of Fame left tackle Jonathan Ogden and center Mike Flynn - have played more games with the Ravens. \nYanda says, \"Hopefully, I will finish my career as a Raven.\" \nThe deal was announced Friday. \nRavens general manager Ozzie Newsome says, \"Marshal is not only a staple of our offensive line, but also a staple of our entire team. He is the best of what a Raven should be.\" CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
