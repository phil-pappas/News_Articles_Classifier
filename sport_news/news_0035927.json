However, on the bright side, the 58 points they scored were more than in their previous seven games combined. \nBayside had scored a total of 43 points across the first seven games, with nine points being the highest total in any one game. All of that changed Friday night, but the team still couldn’t grab the W. \nThere were times Friday when the win was so close they could practically grab it. The Brahmans committed 13 penalties and fumbled the ball eight times. \nHOLY TRINITY 48, ARCH CURLEY 13 \nIn Melbourne, the county’s leading rusher, Jashaun Corbin, ran for 184 yards and a touchdown, caught a 38-yard touchdown and returned a kick 90 yards for a score to lead Holy Trinity. \nCorbin even got in on the passing game, connecting with Sean Taylor for a 38-yard completion on a half back option. \nThe impressive victory was capped off with the news that Fort Pierce John Carroll defeated Melbourne Central Catholic 37-3, which means the Tigers and Rams are assured of Class 3A, District 6 playoff spots. Holy Trinity hosts John Carroll on Oct. 30 for the district championship. \nASTRONAUT 18, LAKE HIGHLAND 12 \nIn Orlando, Devell Taylor rushed for 35 yards on five carrier out of the wildcat in second half, scoring the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter to propel Astronaut into the playoffs. \nBy defeating Lake Highland, the War Eagles clinched a Class 4A, District 5 playoff berth. \nJavian Hawkins had perhaps the play of the game in the second quarter when he broke three tackles around the line of scrimmage before taking off for a 76-yard touchdown. \nAstronaut has a meeting with 4A-5 leader Cocoa next week. \nMORE: Brevard County high school football \nJENSEN BEACH 36, EAU GALLIE 29 \nIn Jensen Beach, the home team scored in the final minute to win a back-and-forth game against Eau Gallie. \nTim Caffey connected with Tyrese Jackson with 30 seconds left in the game to grab the victory. \nEau Gallie quarterback Matt Wilson completed six passes for 184 yards and a touchdown. He also scampered for an 85-yard score. \nJOHN CARROLL 37, MCC 3 \nIn Fort Pierce, in a key Class 3A, District 6 game, the Melbourne Central Catholic Hustlers needed a victory over the John Carroll Rams in order to keep their postseason hopes alive. \nUnfortunately for the Hustlers, the Rams proved worthy of postseason play for the first time in 11 years as they defeated the Hustlers. \nThe Hustlers were able to avoid the shutout as Will McKegg converted on a 47-yard field goal as time ran out in the first half of play. \nThe Rams’ victory eliminates the Hustlers from any possibility of postseason play. \nThe district title will be now be awarded to the winner of the Holy Trinity versus John Carroll game in two weeks, with the loser becoming the district runner-up. \nSOUTH FORK 35, MELBOURNE 21 \nIn Stuart, Melbourne held a brief lead after one quarter, but South Fork scored three times in the second, propelling it to victory. \nChris Singh had touchdown runs of 23 and 66 yards to give Melbourne a 14-7 lead after one quarter. \nBut South Fork scored three unanswered TDs in the second quarter and led 28-14 at the half. \nMelbourne pulled within a score when Dezmond Morgan punched in an 18-yard TD in the third quarter, but South Fork clinched the game with one more score midway through the fourth. \nLAKE MARY 14, MIC 8 \nIn Lake Mary, Merritt Island Christian grabbed an early lead, but a tough third quarter led to a close defeat to Lake Mary Prep. \nMIC opened the scoring when quarterback Max Power hit Steven Williams for a 12-yard touchdown in the first quarter. Power converted the two-point play, and the Cougars led 8-0. \nIn the third quarter, Lake Mary struck twice on TD passes by Walker Dycus. \nDycus hit Connor Whan for a 15-yard score, then the QB took the two-point conversion in to even the score. Less than three minutes later, Dycus hit Matt Upper for a three-yard score. The two-point try was not good, but Lake Mary led 14-8. \nWith a full quarter remaining, MIC couldn’t punch in a potential game-tying score, and the Cougars fell 14-8.
