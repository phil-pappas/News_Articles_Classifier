(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) Sponsored Links \nThe Chicago Cubs envisioned Jon Lester on the mound starting big October games. \nThey did not imagine him giving up big October home runs. \nInstead of lifting the Cubs within three wins of their first World Series appearance since 1908, Lester allowed them to slip within three losses of elimination. \nHe gave up a first-inning home run to Daniel Murphy and a sixth-inning drive to Travis d'Arnaud in the New York Mets' 4-2 win in the NL Championship Series opener. The result was not much different than his 4-0 defeat to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Division Series opener. \nYes, that's right, the $155 million man is 0-2 in the playoffs. \nWhen Lester signed a six-year deal last December, the Cubs feted Lester with a news conference at Spiaggia, the Michigan Avenue restaurant that is one of President Barack Obama 's favorites. Still seeking its first title since 1908, perhaps Chicago should hold off on the truffled meals and wait until after a championship. \nLester's big numbers on Saturday night were 386 and 431 — the length of the two home runs. \nWhen Cubs manager Joe Maddon — wearing gloves and a ski cap on the chilly night — strolled to the mound to remove Lester after Curtis Granderson's seventh-inning sacrifice fly, Lester slowly walked back to the third-base dugout, head bowed, glove dangling from his left hand. \nLester was 11-12 during the regular season, more a supporting player on a pitching staff starring Jake Arrieta. Lester's aversion to holding on baserunners was well documented — after not making a single pickoff throw in 2014, he made just four all season — two on April 13 and one apiece on Aug. 13 and Sept. 20, according to STATS. He allowed 44 stolen bases, seven more than any other major league pitcher. \nJuan Lagares swiped third base to set up Granderson's sacrifice fly. Lester's night was soon over. \nChicago overcame Lester in the Division Series, winning three in a row over the Cardinals to advance. Now they have to rebound from him again.
