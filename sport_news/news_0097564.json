(AP Photo/Michael Perez) more > By DAN GELSTON -   \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Drew Brees let a game stuffed with turnovers and shaky line protection finally get the best of him with New Orleans trailing in the second half. \nHe sprinted toward an official and complained when an incomplete deep pass to C.J. Spiller on third down failed to draw the pass interference flag Brees thought the play deserved. \n“That was just one isolated incident,” Brees said. “I felt like we had the right play, the right combination, all those things.” \nThe Saints punted - and their slim playoff hopes may have been given the boot. \nBrees and the Saints rarely had the right plays against Philadelphia. Brees had three turnovers and New Orleans failed to put away the Eagles after two early red-zone interceptions in a 39-17 loss on Sunday. \nThe Saints fell to 1-4 a week after an overtime win against Dallas. \nEven worse, there’s a short week of preparation ahead for Thursday’s game against Atlanta. \n“If you don’t have good character guys, you’d be worried about that,” Brees said. “But we have good character guys, so I’m not worried about that.” \nHe needs to worry about helping New Orleans snap out of a malaise that’s plopped them in last place in the NFC South and couldn’t bury an Eagles team that had their season on the ropes and were erratic early Sunday. \nBrees’ three turnovers led to 17 points for the Eagles. He finished 26 of 43 for 335 yards, two TDs and one interception. He struggled to find time for the big pass plays behind a makeshift offensive line - left tackle Terron Armstead and right guard Jahri Evans sat out with injuries - and was sacked five times. \nWillie Snead had six catches for 141 yards and Brandin Cooks had five catches for 107 yards and a touchdown. \nBut it wasn’t near enough against the Eagles. Philadelphia had a season-high 519 total yards, forced four turnovers and punted only once. \nThe Eagles had the playmakers on offense and let Fletcher Cox dominate on defense. Cox forced two fumbles on sacks to help the Eagles (2-3) snap a three-game losing streak at home that dated to last season. \nBrees was fed up with losing. \n“I don’t want to hear anything about youth, I don’t want to hear anything about talent,” he said. “I don’t want to hear anything about anything other than what are we going to do to win the game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:21:40.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
