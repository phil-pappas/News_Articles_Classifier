Stacy Long \n1. Snack on Dak: MSU quarterback Dak Prescott was a mere pup when he last faced the Trojans. Now, he’s a Heisman candidate. Prescott, who made his third career start vs. Troy in 2013, is now the owner of 22 Mississippi State school records. “First of all, we all know he’s got an ‘S’ underneath his shirt,” Troy defensive coordinator Vic Koenning said. “Him and Cam Newton probably have that corner of the world.” Prescott is MSU’s all-time leading passer and is 132 rushing yards from becoming its top running QB. He has eight career 100-yard rushing games. “He’s going to drop back to pass and he’ll go through his reads,” Troy defensive end Tyler Roberts said. “If he doesn’t see what he likes, he can take off and run with it. He’s not a quarterback who will run and slide. He’s going to fight for those extra yards.” Troy linebacker Terris Lewis is impressed with Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott. Stacy Long \n2. Cling, clang: Troy’s practice plans this week included some cowbell, which was sure to draw the ire of one of its linebackers. “I really do not like cowbells,” junior Justin Lucas said. “They are annoying and loud, and I really do not like cowbells.” Lucas is from Aberdeen, Miss., just up the road from Starkville, though he said he was neutral in the MSU-Ole Miss rivalry. “I think I am going to have more motivation because of me growing up so close to Mississippi State and with them recruiting me out of high school and never offering me,” Lucas said. “I think I am going to have a little more added motivation inside me for this game.” Troy defensive end Tyler Roberts says the Trojans must be wary of Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott's running ability, too. Stacy Long 3. Missed chances: Troy’s defensive improvements haven’t led to more turnovers, which is a concern, Koenning said. The Trojans have just one interception and two recovered fumbles in four games. “That’s been a major emphasis,” Koenning said. “We’re getting multiple guys to the ball, and typically when you do that, you’ll create some takeaways. For some reason, we’re not.” \n4. 2-for-1: Saturday’s game is the final piece of the deal that brought Mississippi State to Troy in 2012. The contract, announced in 2009, called for three games between the schools with two in Starkville and one in Troy. \nPLAYER OF THE WEEK \nDontreal Pruitt \nQB, 5-10, 181, Sr. \nPruitt is returning to his home state for the final time as a college player. He’s from Laurel. Troy offensive coordinator Kenny Edenfield says the Trojans hope to show some improvement at Mississippi State from last weekend's loss to South Alabama. Stacy Long \nBY THE NUMBERS \n6: Rushing touchdowns needed by MSU quarterback Dak Prescott to become the second player in Southeastern Conference history with 40 TD runs and 40 TD passes in a career. Florida’s Tim Tebow was the first. \n225: Consecutive pass attempts by Prescott without an interception. \n3: Where Prescott’s streak ranks in SEC history. \n100: Passes without an interception needed for Prescott to tie Kentucky’s Andre Woodson (2006-07). Alabama’s AJ McCarron had 291 in 2011-12. \n2: Consecutive games for Troy with less than 300 yards total offense. \n2006: The last year the Trojans went three games without hitting 300 yards total offense. \n5: Mississippians on Troy’s roster. \n2017: The year of Troy’s next scheduled game with an SEC team. The Trojans play at LSU on Sept. 30, 2017. \nPREDICTION \nThe Trojans should avail themselves better than their last trip to Mississippi State, but such a feat wouldn’t be a remarkable accomplishment. Improving on a 55-point beating is a small step. Mississippi State 41, Troy 13.
