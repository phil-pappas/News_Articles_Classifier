(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (6) Sandy • Dreams of an appearance at next summer's Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro are dangling by a wispy thread for the U.S. men's national team. Following its shocking 2-0 loss against Honduras in Saturday's CONCACAF Olympic qualifying semifinal at Rio Tinto Stadium, the U.S. face Canada in a third-place game Tuesday evening just for the right to board a plane to Rio. A win over Canada, who the U.S. beat 3-1 in its group stage opener on Oct. 1, would pit the Americans in a one-game playoff against CONMEBOL representative Colombia next March to determine the final entry in next summer's Olympic tournament. VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs The loss against Honduras showcased an inability to adapt to the physical, disruptive, counter-attacking style most CONCACAF countries utilize come tournament time. The U.S. failed to generate much of an attack and were caught twice by one of the region's emerging talents in Honduran forward Alberth Elis, who notched both goals in the win over the Americans. \"It's not going to be easy [Tuesday],\" said Real Salt Lake midfielder Luis Gil. Gil echoed the thoughts of U.S. assistant coach John Hackworth, who will be coaching the U.S. U-23s in the third-place match against Canada following the ejection of coach Andi Herzog Saturday against Honduras. The former Philadelphia Union coach noted the difficulty of defeating the same team twice in a tournament. \"That's what we have to do,\" Hackworth said Monday afternoon. \"That's our resolve [Tuesday] is to come with our absolute best, put everything we have into it. If not, it's over for us.\" Against the Canadians, the U.S. will face another methodical, blue-collar approach. Canada is second in Olympic qualifying with 48 fouls committed, two behind Honduras and two ahead of the U.S. Mexico and Honduras already have their tickets to Rio. The Americans must win to avoid not qualifying in three of the last four Summer Games. \"You have to forget about [Saturday] and you have to focus on the now,\" Hackworth said. \"This is an experienced group of players. We have good leaders on this team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:51:33.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
