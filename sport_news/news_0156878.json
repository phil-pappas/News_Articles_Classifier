Joel Priest/Pine River Times file photo Ignacio Bobcats head coach Ponch Garcia is pulling the strings at Ignacio looking his first win as head coach. Garcia will have the team fired up and ready to play Friday’s homecoming matchup against John Mall. A little bit of extra inspiration will be on Ignacio High School’s side this week, as the Bobcats will seek their first win of the season. It will be homecoming night at Ignacio High School on Friday, and there’s sure to be extra energy in the stadium as the Bobcats (0-4) are set to face John Mall (2-2) at 7 p.m. “It’s a special night for the school and the team,” Ignacio head coach Ponch Garcia said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “Hopefully that combined with us getting rid of our tough schedule will help turn this thing around.” After getting out to an early lead last week against Montezuma-Cortez, things looked promising for the young Bobcats. Quarterback Zach Weinrich hooked up with Lawrence Valdez for a score, and running back Tyler Beebe added a rushing touchdown for the Bobcats. However, they weren’t able to hold the lead and came up on the losing end of a 26-14 final score. Though it may not show up on the scoreboard, Garcia has seen a lot of progress and promise in his young, undersized team in his first year coaching the Bobcats. “There’s no quit in these kids, and I’m proud of that,” Garcia said. “We haven’t won yet, and we’ve faced kids who are bigger and stronger than us, but our kids just keep coming and they keep fighting. We’re working with a new system, and we’re taking baby steps, but the work ethic is there and the discipline is there. Every game we get better, and these kids refuse to give up.” It’ll be a tough task Friday for the Bobcats. After losing its first two games, John Mall has won two in a row and outscored its opponents 87-14. Last week, the Panthers celebrated their own homecoming with a 47-0 romp of Dolores Huerta Prep. Ignacio’s team will hope to do the same on their special night. “They appreciate that we’re trying to set them up for success,” Garcia said. “They’re doing the right things, and it’ll come eventually.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:15:12.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
