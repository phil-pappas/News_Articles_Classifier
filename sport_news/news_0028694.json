Players: Hunter Merritt Height and Weight: 6'1\", 192 Graduating Class: 2016Position: Quarterback/SafetyCamp attended: Philadelphia (May) Ed O.B.'s take: Merritt was an All-State Selection at quarterback for the CLASS AAA level in 2014. Merritt competed as a defensive back at the May camp in Philadelphia because he is being recruited the most at that position. Merritt showed he belonged by covering some of the best receivers at the camps and winning the majority of those battles. The one thing that stood out was his fearlessness and competitiveness. Of course, he also had the skills to make him one of the top defensive backs in the camp. Mid-Season thoughts: Merritt has established himself as not only a great two-way player in District 10, but in the entire state of Pennsylvania. If he's not running or passing for touchdowns, he's covering and hitting receivers all over the field. Merritt's go-to receiver is Henry Litwin (we'll get to him at a later date) and they are one of the best pass-catch combos in Pennsylvania High School Football. Take a look at his mid-season highlights below.
