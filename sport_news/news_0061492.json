You know, nothing in me can calculate if it's enough oxygen for me or not. I just play tennis. Today I had an opponent, he was just better than me today,\" he shrugged. \nTsonga added: \"I was like, dizzy. It came just like this, on one run. After one run, I went back to play a return and I feel a little bit dizzy. But I hope it's nothing important.\" \nThe departures of Tsonga and Bouchard come after women's top seeds Simona Halep and Petra Kvitova, troubled by injury and illness, both exited on Sunday. \nThe tail-end of the season has seen a series of retirements and withdrawals, including Serena Williams' decision to rest until next year. Maria Sharapova is also sidelined from Beijing with injury. \nWorld number one Novak Djokovic, unbeaten in five appearances, heads the men's draw while third seed Flavia Pennetta, the US Open champion, is now the on-paper favourite for the women's title.
