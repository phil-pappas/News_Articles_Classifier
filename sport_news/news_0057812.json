The NFL has abstained from partnering with any daily fantasy sites, leaving it up to individual clubs. The Buffalo Bills are one of 15 teams with a FanDuel sponsorship.\nCommissioner Roger Goodell on daily fantasy: “This has been a source of a lot of discussion internally with our ownership and committees. We understand fans are doing this, but we do not want to cross a line that we think is inappropriate and moving forward towards something that we think is prohibited gambling. We are taking a cautious approach to it and making sure we observe how it evolves. Our involvement as clubs is very limited and much more limited than any other league. Our relationship is more limited to an advertising relationship at this point.”\nNo gamblegate: While the NFL has been engulfed by myriad scandals the past couple years, they’ve avoided public gambling embarrassments since Indianapolis Colts quarterback Art Schlichter in the 1980s.\nNHL\nBetting popularity: A 2015 Eilers Research survey of daily fantasy players showed the NHL ranked fifth in popularity, one spot behind golf.\nLeague stance: The NHL seems to accept that it’s a bit player in the gambling realm.\nCommissioner Gary Bettman: “We are a very small part of the take. This is really a football and basketball issue. I believe that there are things to consider in terms of what message it sends to young people about what sport is, what the environment is in the building. Are people rooting for their teams, or are they rooting for their bets and to cover the spread?”\nBettman on betting: With slim margins of victory and goals scored off ricochets, hockey is a difficult sport to bet on. The average NHL game featured 5.2 goals last season. “For us, based on the way the game is played and the scoring, it’s not a factor.”\nNothing to report: Bettman was asked about hockey’s history of concealing injuries compared to the NFL’s injury reports that encourage betting action. “That tells you how we view the lack of importance of gambling on our game,” he replied. “And you know our players tend to play hurt perhaps more than players in other sports.”\nNBA\nBetting popularity: Of the major leagues, it ranks second in traditional betting. The Eilers Research daily fantasy player survey ranked the NBA third.\nLeague stance: Adam Silver, just eight months after replacing longtime NBA Commissioner David Stern, shook up the establishment with a New York Times editorial that declared, “Congress should adopt a federal framework that allows states to authorize betting on professional sports, subject to strict regulatory requirements and technological safeguards.”\nCommissioner Adam Silver: “When I’m sitting with fans and I look around, I often see people in front of me who have phones or small tablets, and they’re wagering. If you go to Google and put in ‘bet NBA,’ you can spend a day looking at sites that are out there. It’s not legal in the United States, but it’s not stopping people from putting their credit cards in and engaging in that behavior.”\nNotable scandal: Referee Tim Donaghy in 2007 received a 15-month prison sentence and was ordered to pay $195,000 in restitution for betting on NBA games.\nAlready in Vegas: Site of Summer League games since ’04 and the ’07 All-Star Game.\nMLB\nBetting popularity: The Eilers Research survey shows baseball ranks second for daily fantasy players.\nLeague stance: No sport has a deeper aversion to traditional sports betting because of its many disgraces, including the 1919 Black Sox and Pete Rose.\nCommissioner Rob Manfred: “The fantasy space has always been an important source of fan engagement for baseball. ... We are particularly interested in the DraftKings games that are more limited in terms of time – daily, weekly, whatever – because our research shows those are popular among young people, and it’s important to be active in that space. There are tremendous benefits for us in terms of growing the game.”\nPete Rose update: The all-time hits leader met with Manfred last week to discuss reinstatement. Former Commissioner Bart Giamatti banned Rose for life in 1991 for betting on baseball games. A decision is expected by the end of the year.\nFay Vincent firm on Rose ban: “The Pete Rose case isn’t about Pete Rose,” Giamatti’s successor said. “It’s about the deterrent to anyone who would think about betting on baseball.”\nNASCAR\nBetting popularity: In Nevada’s legal sportsbooks, NASCAR continues to grow but is about as stylish as hockey. The Eilers Research survey pegged NASCAR sixth among daily fantasy players, one spot ahead of mixed-martial arts.\nLeague stance: NASCAR seems open to exploring all options on sports betting, but with trepidation.\nChairman Brian France: “In our sport, with 43 teams out there and the whole mechanical piece, obviously, what the leagues are most concerned with is there’s not some things that happen with manipulation as a result of that.”\nNotable scandal: Not gambling-related, but what occurred at the 2013 Federated Auto Parts 400 showed how a race could be fixed. Clint Bowyer spun out to get a yellow caution flag and Brian Vickers inexplicably pitted late to help teammate Martin Truex Jr. gain a valuable spot in the Chase for the Sprint Cup field over Ryan Newman.\nViva Las Vegas: While other sports leagues have hemmed and hawed about doing business in Nevada because of legalized sports betting, NASCAR has staged a premier series race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway since 1998.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:47:48.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
