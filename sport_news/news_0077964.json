Unfortunately for the Braves, Clarksville didn’t. \nBrownstown improved to 6-2 overall and 5-1 in the Mid-Southern Conference with a 38-13 victory at Silver Creek. But North Harrison clinched the outright MSC crown with a 53-7 home win over Clarksville on Friday. \nAfter back-to-back losses to the Cougars and rival Seymour, the Braves have rebounded with easy wins over Clark County foes. \nThe Braves had 451 yards of offense, including 267 on the ground. Gavin Bane led the ground attack with 98 yards on 11 carries and a pair of scores. Kyle Kramer was efficient through the air, completing eight of his 11 passes for 184 yards and touchdown tosses to three different receivers. Kramer also rushed for 52 yards. Ryan Benter caught three of Kramer’s passes for 87 yards and a score. \nBrownstown systematically drove down the field on its first possession Friday and Bane gave the Braves an 8-0 lead with a 5-yard touchdown run and a 2-point conversion run. \nSilver Creek looked like it would respond, driving down to the Brownstown 10-yard line on the ensuing possession. However, the Dragons coughed the ball up in the red zone. Like its first possession, the Braves quickly drove down the field for another score. This time, Kramer threw a deep ball to Benter, who beat the Silver Creek defense for a 45-yard score and a 16-0 Brownstown lead. \nBane’s second touchdown made it 24-0 less than two minutes into the second quarter. \nThe game was even over the final 34 minutes, but by the time Silver Creek got going, its fate had been sealed. \nNoah Jones got the Dragons on the board with 4:18 to go in the half on a 1-yard TD plunge, but Kramer connected with Cam Shoemaker for a 10-yard score with 1:49 remaining in the second quarter to give the Braves a 32-7 halftime advantage. \nEarly in the third quarter, Kramer made it 38-7 when his 21-yard pass found John McKinney in the end zone. \nJones scored for the second time on a 4-yard run late in the third for the final score of the contest. Jones went for 97 yards on 16 carries in the loss. Jacob Garrett added 52 yards on 16 totes and Creek quarterback Jeff Belviy was 6-for-10 for 61 yards passing. \nJosh Anderson led the Silver Creek defense with nine tackles. Zach Mitchell added seven tackles, including one for a loss. \nBane was also effective on the defense. He had six tackles to lead the way. Matt Nierman, Derek Rieckers, Justin Donnells and Lendon Underwood each had five tackles for the Braves. Donnells and Jacob Brewer each had a pair of tackles for loss in the victory. \nBrownstown completes its regular season next Friday at home against Corydon Central. Silver Creek will look for a program-record fifth win next Friday when it hosts Scottsburg, which restarted its program this fall. \nBROWNSTOWN CENTRAL 38, SILVER CREEK 13 \nBrownstown 16 16 6 0—38 \nSilver Creek 0 7 6 0—13 \nSCORING PLAYS \nB — Gavin Bane 5 run (Bane run), 7:45. \nB — Ryan Benter 45 pass from Kyle Kramer (Justin Donnells run), 1:09. \nSecond quarter \nB — Bane 11 run (Devin Stuckwisch run), 10:32. \nS — Noah Jones 1 run (Daniel Barrett kick), 10:32. \nB — Cam Shoemaker 10 pass from Kramer (Donnells run), 1:49. \nThird quarter \nB — John McKinney 21 pass from Kramer (run failed), 9:08. \nS — Jones 4 run (kick blocked), 2:13. \nGAME STATISTICS \nBrownstown (42-267): Bane 11-98, McKinney 11-60, Kramer 8-52, Matt Nierman 6-28, Donnells 5-23, Stuckwisch 1-6. \nSilver Creek (46-189): Jones 16-97, Jacob Garrett 16-52, Josh Thompson 6-32, Jeff Belviy 8-8. \nPassing \nSilver Creek (6-11-61-0): Belviy 6-10-61-0, Garrett 0-1-0-0. \nReceiving \nBrownstown: Benter 3-87, Nierman 1-41, McKinney 1-21, Grant Reedy 1-20, Shoemaker 1-10, Stuckwisch 1-5. \nSilver Creek: Thompson 2-46, Kolten Stevens 4-15. \ngreg.mengelt@newsandtribune.com With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:16:31.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
