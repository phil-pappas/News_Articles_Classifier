He also has a deeper bag of tricks that almost anyone in the country. The Ducks are trying to prepare for all the possibilities. \n“As a coach, you’re trying to go back as far as you possibly can and break out the 16-millimeter film and find wherever it is,” Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich said. \nThe Huskies used a fantastic double-pass against the Trojans last Thursday that led to a touchdown. It ended up being the game winner. \n“That really sprung the USC game, the double pass,” Helfrich said. “They’ve had a couple near misses, had some touchdowns on those plays.” \nHelfrich said that the potential for trick plays means that Oregon's defenders will have to be even more sound in their assignments, something the defense has struggled with this season. \n“They’ve done a great job with shifting and motioning, moving around, running a base package of plays and then having a trick off that,” Helfrich said. “That’s where eye discipline and focus on your job, is absolutely vital.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:40:57.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
