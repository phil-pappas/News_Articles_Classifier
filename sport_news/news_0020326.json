Despite being lifted from the game before the end of the third quarter, he completed 11-of-15 passes for 187 yards and a career-high four touchdowns (53, 41, 24 and one yards). He compiled an incredible 266.05 pass-efficiency rating, which is the fifth-best single-game passer rating in the nation this season and shattered his previous career high of 206.93, set in Appalachian’s season opening victory over Howard. \nThe sophomore was especially effective in App State’s 28-point second quarter, when he went 5-of-7 for 136 yards and three touchdowns to help stake the Mountaineers to a commanding 35-0 halftime lead. \nLamb was named Sun Belt Student-Athlete of the Week for the second time in his career. \nHe also earned the award for his performance in last season’s 31-29 win over UL Monroe. \nLaw led Appalachian State to its second shutout of the young season with a team-high seven tackles (including one for loss) and an interception during Saturday’s blowout in Norfolk. \nHis biggest play of the afternoon came when he recorded his second interception of the season to spark a Mountaineer touchdown drive early in the third quarter. \nLed by the junior, Appalachian limited Old Dominion to just 175 total yards, barely half of its 340.3-yard average coming into the contest. ODU managed only 42 rushing yards, including just 22 by Ray Lawry, who entered the game as the nation’s No. 13 rusher with a 151-yard average. \nLaw also earned the second weekly Sun Belt award of his career. He was previously honored for his showing in last season’s finale against Idaho.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:57:27.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
