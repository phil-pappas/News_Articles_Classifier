Badhani, the founder president of the Sanstha, today said the organisation was at work since day one. The first event organised by the Sanstha was a folk dance presentation in front of tourists from around 30 countries in Uttarkashi on Friday. Badhani said the traditonal artistes, artisans, drummers and dancers from Sangrali, Laksheshwar, adahaat etc had been included in the Sanstha to keep the flame of traditional practices alive in the villages. Another motive of forming the organisation was that there was a lack of literary events at Uttarkashi. The separate state struggle was carried out to preserve the unique identity of the hill people but the whole idea of a separate cultural identity seemed to have been lost into oblivion. The Sanstha would try to find people who were averse in the local dialects, both in written and oral form, and organise workshops for the same in the near future, he added. However, the government was talking of developing villagers but besides false claims, it was doing nothing for them, Badhani alleged. Theatre artiste Surendar Puri said efforts were being made to save the culture but till the time the traditional drummers were not saved, it would be difficult to save the traditional culture. Through the new organisation, people who were forced to stop playing traditional instruments would be motivated so that they do not leave the profession abruptly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:16:26.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
