LOUIS â€” St. Louis Cardinals starter Jaime Garcia was removed due to a stomach virus after two shaky innings of Game 2 in the NL Division Series. \nGarcia badly blew a play on a safety squeeze by pitcher Kyle Hendricks that led to the Cubs' five-run second inning and was victimized by another successful squeeze the next at-bat. \nThough none of the runs were earned, the lefty's first postseason start since 2012 was a disaster. He left trailing 5-1. \nThe team made the announcement before the fifth inning. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:41:34.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
