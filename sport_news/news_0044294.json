These days, that man is himself likely to be the resident kitchen wizard, and anyway, he’s probably watching his carbs. But if you’re married to an Englishman an ocean away from home—as I am—and you place a heaping plate of bacon, Lincolnshire sausage, black pudding, eggs, baked beans, tomato, mushrooms and toast before him, you may discover that the old saying rings pretty true.\nSuch is the power of the full English breakfast. Britain has not historically been celebrated for its refined cuisine, but it has a long and distinguished tradition of producing emotionally captivating comfort foods, culinary equivalents of the baggy old sweatshirt you wear when you have the flu. Meat pies, fish and chips, shortbread: The full English is a cornerstone of this category.\nThe dish rose to popularity in the mid-19th century, when the working man needed a hot, heavy breakfast to compensate for the meager packed lunch that would be his midday meal. In today’s England, the full English persists as a staple from Mayfair hotel dining rooms to Cumbrian pubs, cutting across class as well as geography. The full English is as fully English as they come.\nAt the Clocktower in New York, Jason Atherton, the chef behind London restaurants Pollen Street Social and Berners Tavern among others, is now replicating the quintessentially British dish on American shores. Some translation has been required. For instance, the bacon used in a traditional English breakfast is so-called “back bacon,” meaty slabs cut from the pig’s loin rather than its belly (the latter, simply called “bacon” here, is known as “streaky bacon” in the U.K.). Mr. Atherton hasn’t been able to find an adequate source for back bacon stateside, so he goes the streaky route at his New York restaurant with a product sold by Wisconsin-based artisan outfit Nueske’s. With each ingredient prepared simply—pan-fried, mostly—quality is key.\nSee the Recipes ENLARGE Full English Breakfast Photo: James Ransom for The Wall Street Journal, Food Styling by Jamie Kimm, Prop Styling by Nidia Cueva Traditional Full English Breakfast Mexi-Cali-English Breakfast His black pudding, a blood sausage, comes from Tommy Moloney’s, a New Jersey-based company with Irish roots. Breakfast sausages are made by special order by meat purveyor Pat LaFrieda; Mr. Atherton recommends that home cooks look for a high-quality pork and herb sausage in a natural, rather than synthetic, casing. And as for the baked beans? Always Heinz—yes, the kind from a tin. “I’ve been cooking 30 years, and nothing beats Heinz baked beans,” Mr. Atherton said. At the Clocktower, the chef offers them as an optional side dish rather than pooling them on the breakfast plate, a concession to American preferences.\n‘ Britain has a long and distinguished tradition of producing some of the world’s most emotionally captivating comfort foods. ’\nAs satisfying as a full English can be, it is a gut-busting proposition for many of today’s Greek-yogurt devotees. Born in the north of England, Brendan Collins is an old hand at translating English dishes for the more health-minded, having cooked in southern California for over a decade. “I find that Americans quite like English food, but their palates are so much more used to spice,” said the chef and owner of Birch in Los Angeles. “The food here is fresher, more spice-forward, and not quite as heavy.”\nFor a fresh spin on the full English, Mr. Collins goes the Mexi-Cali route: Lincolnshire sausage gives way to spicy chorizo, tomatoes take the form of a zippy salsa and corn tortillas stand in for toast. Savory black beans replace Heinz’s baked version. Poached eggs provide a lighter alternative to fried, while avocado lends the richness you want from a full English, but in the form of healthy fat. The plate is hearty and wholesome—not sustenance enough for a day in the mines, maybe, but plenty of fuel for your morning spin class.\nMore in Eating & Drinking Recipe for a Life-Changing Soup Cook Up a Shelling Bean Feast Recipes for Getting the Best Return on a Surplus of Vegetables Champion of Breakfasts: What’s the Winning Egg Sandwich Recipe?
