ARMAS - Associated Press - Saturday, October 10, 2015 \nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - In studying the Green Bay Packers on film, Rams coach Jeff Fisher sees a defense that can go step for step with his team when it comes to rushing the quarterback. \nUnfortunately for St. Louis, Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers is no ordinary quarterback. \nThe Rams are up next Sunday for Rodgers at Lambeau Field, where the Packers have the league’s longest active winning streak at home, 11 games. \n“I don’t think there’s anything underrated about him at all,” Fisher said. “You watch him on tape, he extends plays. He extends to his right, to his left, steps up, runs for first downs and just he knows what to do with the football.” \nForemost among those responsibilities for Rodgers is taking care of the football for the unbeaten Packers (4-0). \nThrough four games, the league MVP has thrown 11 touchdowns and no interceptions. At Lambeau, Rodgers hasn’t thrown an interception since Dec. 2, 2012, spanning NFL home records of 486 straight pass attempts and 43 touchdowns. \nThe Rams (2-2) will try to rattle Rodgers with a tough pass rush. They’re tied with Green Bay with 17 sacks, one behind the league-leading Denver Broncos. \nSt. Louis is unique in that its defense can collapse a pocket from the inside-out with athletic tackle Aaron Donald leading the way. The Packers had one of the league’s top offensive lines last season, though the protection hasn’t been airtight this year. \n“Everybody has a pass rush plan … It will be clear what their plan is as far as how they want to come in here Sunday because of Aaron’s ability to step out of (gaps) or when one side collapses,” coach Mike McCarthy said. “That’s all part of the game. It’s part of a chess match.” \nYOUNG RAMS: St. Louis went on the road last week to hand previously undefeated Arizona its first loss. Rookie running back Todd Gurley finished strong in his first NFL start after rushing for 106 of his 146 yards in the fourth quarter. \nThe performance gave a confidence boost to a relatively inexperienced offensive line with two rookie starters. \n“There’s nothing like success,” offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti said. “We want to move on and get another one.” \nNO RUSH: Green Bay’s rush defense has been stout of late, limiting starting running backs to an average of about 36 yards on 11 carries over the last three games. Mike Daniels and B.J. Raji are off to strong starts on the line, and linebacker Clay Matthews has been making plays whether he’s lined up on the inside or outside. \nThe defense is succeeding even without two of its better run defenders: safety Morgan Burnett (calf) has missed three of the last four games, while starting inside linebacker Sam Barrington (right foot) is out for the year. \nSACKS STREAK: Stopping the run on early downs allows the Packers to focus on the pass rush on third-and-longs. Rodgers and the offense also have a propensity to score early at home to put teams in catch-up situations that can make opposing offenses even more one-dimensional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:50:04.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
