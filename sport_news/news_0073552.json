Just about everywhere Stonehill College sophomore quarterback Matt Foltz has turned, the subject of the Skyhawks’ amazing comeback victory over LIU Post last Saturday has been raised. “I couldn’t even count how many times I’ve talked about it,’’ said Foltz. “It’s everywhere I go.’’ What Foltz and Stonehill did in a showdown of unbeaten Northeast-10 Conference teams in Brookville, N.Y., ranks right up there with the best come-from-behind wins ever. Trailing by 17 points with just over a minute to go, the Skyhawks rallied for a 40-37 victory with Foltz throwing three touchdown passes in the final 1:02. For his performance, Foltz was named the weekly winner of the New England Football Writers Gold Helmet Award as the top Division 2 and 3 player in the region. Foltz was presented the award during a luncheon at Harvard University on Wednesday. Foltz set a school record by throwing for 421 yards and tied the Stonehill mark with six TD passes. He was 30 for 46, including 14 for 24 for 245 yards and four scores in the final quarter. The capper was a 41-yard “Hail Mary’’ TD pass to Corey White as time expired to give the Skyhawks the win. “I think this is a play most people at Stonehill will remember for a long time,’’ said Foltz, a native of Mount Joy, Pa. “I’ll remember this comeback for the rest of my life.’’ The Skyhawks, who were behind, 30-6, in the third quarter, trailed LIU Post, 37-20, when they got the ball with just over two minutes left. Foltz took Stonehill 75 yards in seven plays, using up 1:06. He threw a 13-yard TD pass to Kaleb Lutton to make it 37-27 with 1:02 remaining. “I knew if we had any shot, we had to go quick and score as fast as possible,’’ said Foltz. “That was my focus, save as much time as possible.’’ The defense then forced a three-and-out with a 15-yard penalty on LIU Post helping Stonehill. The Skyhawks received a punt at the Pioneers’ 43 and needed only 23 seconds to get into the end zone in four plays, an 11-yard TD pass to Dave Harrison making it 37-34 with six seconds remaining. Stonehill then recovered the onside kick, giving Foltz time for one play from the LIU Post 41. He was nearly sacked but scrambled and finally found open space in order to heave the ball towards White in the left side of the end zone. White grabbed the ball, making a superb catch for the winning score. Page 2 of 2 - “We were going on (the snap count of) two, but the center snapped it on one, and half the linemen didn’t realize it,’’ said Foltz, who had never even attempted a last-second desperation throw to the end zone before. “From there, it was just kind of chaos. Our line figured it out and had a couple of great blocks. “I was able to get rid of the ball and Corey made a great play in the end zone. “I saw him, but there were two or three defenders around him. I just tried to put it in a spot where he could go up and make a play. It was like throwing up a prayer.’’ The prayer was answered for Stonehill (now 4-0 for the first time in 20 years), and the Skyhawks were able to return home with a win for the ages. Foltz is leading the NE-10 in passing yards per game (249), TD passes (14, third in the nation), completion percentage (67.2) and pass efficiency rating (172.99, ninth in the country). The comeback to remember will always be a highlight of his career, which has 21/2 seasons to go. “It’s all kind of a blur now,’’ said Foltz, who has been the conference’s offensive player of the week twice. “It all happened so fast. It’s almost like the last couple of minutes are blacked out. “It’s one of those things where you can’t quit, so you tell the guys we’ve got to keep going and just compete and just keep doing your job. Hopefully, something will happen and obviously good things happened.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:29:24.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
