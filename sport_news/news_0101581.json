(Image Source: Bryan Lennon/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at the four keys to the New York Jets upsetting the undefeated New England Patriots on Sunday: \n(1) Pressure Brady \nThis is always the key when taking on an elite quarterback like Tom Brady . If he can get comfortable in the pocket and is given time to dissect the opposing defense, Brady can pick any secondary apart. So far this season, the Jets only have eight sacks, but that doesn’t mean they haven’t harassed opposing QBs. Moreover, they do two things that could bother Brady. One is get pressure up the middle. Muhammad Wilkerson leads the team with four sacks from his five-technique position and Sheldon Richardson recorded a half-a-sack last week in his 2015 debut. Throw in rookie Leonard Williams as well as nose tackle Damon Harrison and the Jets have one of the best defensive fronts in the NFL, very capable of getting pressure in Brady’s face and force him out of his comfort zone. In addition to their star-studded D-line, no one loves to blitz more than HC Todd Bowles . Last week former Jet LaRon Landry sacked Brady and we could see the same thing happen this week. Look for LB’s David Harris (2 sacks) coming up the middle or Demario Davis off the edge, something he’s done much more under Bowels, as well as CB Buster Skrine bringing pressure from his slot corner position. \n(2) Take the Ball Away \nIn 197 attempts, Tom Brady has thrown just one interception, but as we saw with Aaron Rodgers against the St. Louis Rams (2 INTs) even the best of the best is vulnerable to the turnover bug against a defense with a strong D-line and an aggressive secondary. While the Jets pass rush isn’t at the level of the Rams, their defensive backs can be even more aggressive and with eight INTs they’re tied for third in the NFL. What Bowles’s defensive scheme does is create turnovers. With cornerbacks like Darrelle Revis (3 INTs, 3 PDs), Antonio Cromartie (3 PDs) and Buster Skrine (3 PDs), as well as safety Marcus Gilchrist (2 INTs, 5 PDs) the Jets have the cover skills, length, size and short-area quickness to match up with New England’s pass catchers. Revis vs. Julian Edelman , Cromo on Rob Gronkowski and Skrine covering Danny Amendola are some potential matchups to watch. If the Jets win those battles, they may win the war. \n(3) Ball Control \nAnother way to limit Tom Brady’s production is to simply keep him on the sidelines. The Jets are first in the NFL in rushing offense, averaging a league-best 146 yards per game (4.5 YPC) on the ground. The powerful Chris Ivory is having a Pro Bowl caliber season rushing for 460 yards and four TDs while averaging 5.5 YPC in four games this season. In the past two games, against Miami and Washington, Ivory has run for 312 yards on 49 carries (6.4 YPC). He may be the most underrated athlete in New York City right now. New England’s run defense is vulnerable and because they have jumped out to big leads they haven’t been as exposed as they could have been this season. Their 4.9 yards per run allowed is the third worst in the NFL so if New York can keep it close they may be able to run all over the Patriots. \n(4) Make Plays in the Passing Game \nI’m talking specifically about the wide receivers. Just as New York’s defensive backs feel they can match up with New England’s pass catchers, there’s no reason the Jets wide outs shouldn’t be able to win against the covermen of the Patriots. Gone are Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner . That means a lot of responsibility on Malcolm Butler , Logan Ryan and Tarell Brown . You have to believe Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker like their chances. With four-straight 100-yard games (seven-plus catches), Marshall is playing as well as he has in his entire career. He’s making plays after the catch and owns the 50/50 ball. Meanwhile, Decker is so deft working the middle of the field out of the slot. Both have four TDs on the season (8 total TDs in 9 combined starts). This also could be an opportunity for rookie Devin Smith to have a breakout game. Smith has speed to spare, can stretch the field and has great timing in the air. My advice to QB Ryan Fitzpatrick , try to overthrow him and let’s see what happens. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
