Stuff like that — you have to learn it’s not on everybody, but you have to be able to get excited about things like that. \n“Every time you touch the field, you should be excited to touch the field. [Saturday], we weren’t.” \nThat lack of passion in a crucial Missouri Valley Football Conference home game was at the forefront of YSU’s concern’s following the contest. \nTied together with poor execution (the Jackrabbits out-gained YSU 334 to 278 in total-yards despite 11 less plays), head coach Bo Pelini sent a clear message to his team during his post-game press conference. \n“Believe me, every single guy that played in that game is gonna be looked at,” Pelini said. \n“When you can’t get a first down offensively, you’re eventually gonna have some problems,” Pelini said. “But it’s a team game. \n“Special teams was horrendous at times. ... Like I said, every guy — coaches and players alike — better take a good, hard look in the mirror.” \nWith a couple of road games up next (at Southern Illinois on Saturday, at Western Illinois on Oct. 31), YSU (3-3, 1-2) needs to regroup quickly if it’s to put itself in playoff contention. \nWhile Pelini said the quarterback situation will be re-evaluated after starter Hunter Wells struggled and backup Ricky Davis replaced him in the fourth quarter, the banged-up offensive line may see changes as well. \nWhatever decisions are made, YSU certainly realizes things have to change following Saturday’s poor and unenthusiastic showing. \n“I did think we had a good week [of practice],” tight end Jacob Wood said. “Obviously we need to change something, though. We’ll pick it up and do better next week.” \nAttendance blues \nWhile the announced attendance for Saturday’s loss was 14,974, the actual Stambaugh Stadium crowd appeared smaller and cleared out significantly in the second half under rain and 40-degree temperatures. \nThe turnout for a contest featuring no. 11 YSU and no. 7 SDSU disappointed Pelini, who bit his tongue while addressing the topic. \n“There hasn’t been a great crowd since I’ve been here,” the first-year coach said. “It used to be around here that ... I’m not going there. I got enough issues of my own.” \nThe previous week’s home loss to Illinois State drew the season’s biggest home crowd of 17,715 fans. YSU play’s two more regular-season home games — Nov. 7 versus Missouri State and Nov. 14 versus North Dakota State.
