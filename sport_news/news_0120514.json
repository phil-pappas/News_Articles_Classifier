He said if flare-related law changes are required, he is prepared to do so. \nVictoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton told local radio: “There’s a big increase in the amount of flares being let off at these events, and they are an ugly blight and dangerous to people.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:47:49.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
