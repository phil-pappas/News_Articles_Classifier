Not everything is always going to go your way. \n“We need to work on that during the week because the scrum is no doubt one of the cornerstones of the Argentinian game and we need to make sure that functions well for us.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:03:29.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
