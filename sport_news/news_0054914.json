Tweet 25 Comment \nTwitter temporarily shut down two sports news sites, Gawker’s Deadspin and Vox Media’s SB Nation, on Sunday for respectively sharing GIFs and highlights from professional and college football games for copyright violations. \nThe NFL, which saw $7.3 billion in mostly TV revenue last year, sent Deadspin nearly 20 takedown notices invoking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which protects intellectual property and prohibits repurposing copyrighted material without a license to do so. SB Nation received eight notices from XOS Digital, which represents the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and owns many broadcasting rights to college football franchises. \nDeadspin’s account was reinstated — minus the offending GIFs — after parent company Gawker Media appealed Twitter’s deactivation, Recode reported . \nThe NFL said in a statement that its takedown notices were routine and only required Twitter to delink “pirated NFL game videos and highlights that violate the NFL’s copyrights” not suspend the accounts. \nGIFs of sports highlights, movies, and TV shows is common and accepted internet behavior, but the NFL’s history of takedown requests and Twitter’s subsequent crackdown could signal a change that could have many users and fans up in arms. \nThe microblogging site previously shut down a bot account @ReplayLastGoal at FIFA’s request last year for circulating clips and GIFs from the World Cup, Recode reported. \nAlong with the NFL, UFC reportedly also filed DMCA takedown notices against Deadspin for circulating GIFs of copyrighted broadcast content. \nDeadspin took the DMCA kerfuffle in stride, poking fun at the NFL in a few light-hearted tweets once Twitter reactivated its account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:07:29.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
