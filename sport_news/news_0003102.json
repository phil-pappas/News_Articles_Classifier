(Photo: USA TODAY Sports)\n2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE MANCHESTER, England – United States goalkeeper Tim Howard has fired up his teammates ahead of Saturday's CONCACAF Cup showdown with Mexico by stoking the rivalry between the two foes.\nHoward, who is in the squad for the clash at the Rose Bowl – with a place in the 2017 Confederations Cup on the line – believes Mexico still looks down on the USA is soccer terms and is infuriated by the way the Americans have controlled the rivalry in recent years.\n\"The bottom line is that Mexico is pissed off,\" Howard told USA TODAY Sports in an exclusive interview at a Manchester hotel last week. \"They dominated soccer in our region of the world for decades and decades and we couldn't land a glove on them. Over the last 15 years we've dominated the region.\n\"I think they look at Americans and they don't think we can play football, they don't think we are very good yet we continue to get results against them. We have made sure we have continued to win games and play the right way. Whether that upsets them or not I don't know. I don't really care, that's kind of the way it is.\"\nUSA TODAY\nArmour: FIFA must clean house or face 'disaster'\nContests between the teams are always fiery and Howard, whose brief break from national team action following the World Cup means Brad Guzan may retain the goalkeeper's jersey, insisted that the team which keeps its cool will have a huge advantage.\n\"They will play any card they can to try to get an edge,\" Howard added. \"The most important part for us is winning and trying to continue our dominance. That is something we hold dear to us, not letting that slip.\n\"We have done a great job over the last few years of making sure we have kept our heads in the game. You have to be prepared for some of Mexico's antics. I don't think that's any secret.\n\"When you look back for decades, the American player was so naïve. These Mexican players could get away with anything. They probably got a kick out of that. We are no longer rattled. We are no longer fazed by anything they do on the pitch. They used to be able to get under our skin. They can't anymore. They used to be able to dominate us. They can't anymore.\"\n2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN ", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799233563447047-USATSI-8632560.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LkGSVS&text=Tim%20Howard%20fires%20up%20teammates%20ahead%20of%20U.S.-Mexico%20clash&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9cbd8e5f307ca8892deea10de440721b72431926/c=485-0-2818-2333/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798940981826124-450606366.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LkGSVS&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/734fac10538d13406c1d7cd31ef155a9e07b4676/r=300x400/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799233563447047-USATSI-8632560.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7106028fe3911714fa120ae7b224eacda614e503/c=1-4-1465-1956&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799233563447047-USATSI-8632560.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:00:16.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
