Baltimore coach John Harbaugh declined to say whether Smith would be available for Sunday's home game against Cleveland, but all signs point to the 15-year veteran missing the game. \nHarbaugh said Monday: \"He had a tough injury. He'll be back as soon as he can.\" \nThe Ravens are dealing with several injuries to their receiving corps. \nIn addition to Smith, Michael Campanaro was placed on injured reserve Saturday with a herniated disc and first round pick Breshad Perriman has yet to play because of a knee injury. \nTo add depth, the Ravens acquired wide receiver Chris Givens from the St. Louis Rams for a conditional draft pick. Now in his fourth NFL season, the 6-foot Givens has 88 catches for 1,433 yards and four touchdowns. \n\"He's a fast receiver, a downfield threat,\" Harbaugh said. \"He does a lot of good things.\" \nTight end Crockett Gillmore also was injured against the Steelers, but the news Gillmore was better. He missed game before the matchup with the Steelers with a calf injury, but Harbaugh said Gillmore has \"a chance\" to play against the Cleveland Browns . \n\"We'll see where it goes,\" Harbaugh said of the injury to Gillmore, a second-year player who has caught 10 passes for 151 yards and two touchdowns. \nAfter losing the their first three games for the first time in franchise history, the Ravens can pull out of last place with the Browns, who are also 1-3. Harbaugh said Cleveland has a talented front seven and one of the most talented secondaries in the league. \nSo, a victory Sunday with the injuries to its receiver corps will be a challenge for Baltimore. \n\"We're battling to be third place in the division right now,\" Harbaugh said. \"That's where we stand. That's a tall order and we have work to do.\" \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:51:01.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
