(AP) - Cameron Wake got his first four sacks this season and also forced two fumbles - all in the first half - and the Miami Dolphins routed the Tennessee Titans 38-10 on Sunday in Dan Campbell's debut as interim coach. \nThe Dolphins (2-3) came in having lost three straight, costing coach Joe Philbin his job Oct. 5. \nWith Campbell preaching a more fun and physical approach, the Dolphins finished with six sacks and intercepted Marcus Mariota twice. The rookie quarterback needed a knee brace and was replaced by Zach Mettenberger after the 2-minute warning. \nMiami had been one of two teams in the NFL without a rushing touchdown, but Jarvis Landry ended the drought with a TD run, and Lamar Miller ran for 113 yards and a TD. \nThe Titans (1-4) lost their fourth straight, and their home skid is up to eight dating to last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:44:14.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
