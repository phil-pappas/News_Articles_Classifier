Marie Evening News - Sault Ste. Marie, MI By ISIAHOTTEN Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:16 AM By ISIAHOTTENFor The Evening News Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:16 AM RUDYARD — Celebrating Volley for a Cure and adding a win made for a busy Thursday night for the Rudyard Bulldogs. Each of the three sets started evenly enough, but the Bulldogs pinned the Pickford Panthers down and won in three sets. “Really fired up tonight!” said Rudyard coach Ellen Perry. “This is always a very tough game to stay focused for, so I always worry. I never know how it’s going to turn out.” Rudyard led the first set the whole way, settling into a good flow between all players. The Bulldogs won the set 25-16. “We were communicating a lot better and getting more aggressive,” said Rudyard senior Jorgy Trotter. “I think the crowd really gave us the boost in intensity.” The hometown crowd was loud and showed up in an array of pink shirts sporting Volley for a Cure designs from this year and years past. In the second set, the score was tight for the first half of the set. The Panthers and Bulldogs battled neck and neck up into the teens before Rudyard spread the score out of reach and took the set, 25-20. The final set looked much the same until Rudyard hit the set-point-match at 24-14. The Panthers could not afford a single mistake, and they did not commit one for quite a while. They scared the Bulldogs with a big rally before surrendering the match, 25-18. Jorgy Trotter led the Bulldogs with eight kills, six digs, and received almost half of Pickford’s serves with only one error. Sophomore Sierra Dugan (7 kills, 5 digs) and junior Mackenzie Knutsen (22 assists and service leader with 17 makes) supported Trotter in their 3-set shutout. The win was a nice ending to the busy night for the Rudyard volleyball team who were hosting their 6th annual Volley for a Cure. Despite coach Perry’s concerns about focus, Trotter’s opinion was that the event actually motivated her to work harder. “I felt more ready to go and excited this game,” said Trotter. “We were doing it for a good cause,” piped in fellow senior Tayler Stevens. “It just made us want to win even more.” Kayla Rambo had seven kills, two aces and two blocks for Pickford. Taylor Opolka added three kills and three blocks, and Clare Cottle had 10 assists and three kills “Coach Perry and the Rudyard families did an excellent job of coordinating the Volley For a Cure event,” Pickford coach Barb Storey said. “We appreciated being invited to be a part of this great fund-raiser.” On top of games, raffles, and face painting, the event also featured an opportunity to donate hair for a good cause. Stevens was one of the 13 who underwent the cut. Page 2 of 2 - “I was a bit hesitant at first,” said Stevens, “I mean that’s eight inches of your hair. There is a lot of attachment there. But I know it’s going to something good and it’s for kids and they need the self-esteem boost too.” “We had 13 girls donate their hair tonight,” said Perry. “That’s a record. I think last year we had five. It’s really a great cause. The donations go to kids and are for any hair loss – burn units and chemo.” All the proceeds from the game and its events will go toward Relay for Life and the American Cancer Society. Rudyard travels today to Escanaba for a large tournament on Saturday. By ISIAHOTTEN Sault Ste. Marie Evening News - Sault Ste.
