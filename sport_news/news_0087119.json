Now, on the eve of the Vikings' contest against the Detroit Lions at Ford Field, another player has been downgraded on the injury report with an illness.\nAdChoices And this one might have slightly more impact.\nRunning back Adrian Peterson , who had been listed as \"probable\" on Friday's injury report with a finger injury, has now been downgraded to \"questionable\" with an illness.\nThe announcement just came down a few moments ago via the Vikings' team Twitter account, so there is no word on the nature of Peterson's injury at this point. Presumably, the team is already in Detroit, so Peterson is there with the team, but nobody knows exactly what's happening yet. When we get an update, we will pass it on.\nIf Peterson is unable to go, the Vikings would be back to much the same situation that they dealt with all of last season. . .a platoon of Matt Asiata and Jerick McKinnon. They're the only two other running backs on the roster at the present time, though the team does have Dominique Williams on the practice squad. Zach Line could probably see some carries in a pinch as well.\nOnce again, running back Adrian Peterson has been downgraded to \"questionable\" for tomorrow's game against the Detroit Lions due to an illness. We will update this story as more info becomes available.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/108433/everson-griffen", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/131016/matt-asiata", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/detroit-lions", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/245528/dominique-williams", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/minnesota-vikings", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/194921/zach-line", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/19109/adrian-peterson"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:36:53.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
