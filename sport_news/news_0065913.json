It is expected to take place within the last 10 days of October,\" he said.\nMoghazi, however, said that the current dispute is not about a power struggle between the involved parties, stressing that Egypt is seeking political and diplomatic solutions for the stand off.\nThe two foreign consultancy firms were supposed to reach an agreement and deliver their reports on 5 September to a committee of representatives and experts from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan.\nHowever, the Dutch consultancy firm Deltares withdrew from the assessment of the dam.\nDeltares stated that it had withdrawn from the project as the conditions imposed by the Tripartite National Committee (TNC) -- which includes representatives from Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, as well as the French consultancy firm BRL -- did not provide sufficient guarantees for Deltares that an independent high-quality study could be carried out.\nEarlier this month, Egypt called for a TNC meeting in Cairo but Ethiopia requested to postpone it.\nSince then, the future of the Renaissance Dam negotiations has remained unclear.\nEgypt has repeatedly expressed concerns that its share of Nile water could be compromised by Ethiopia's dam project.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:19:59.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
