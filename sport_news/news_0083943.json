About halfway through the race she knew she wasn't feeling her best; I was so proud of how she fought through that, and lives to race another day,” said Carstens. \n“I think her best race is still ahead of her.” \nRight on her big sister’s heels was Mariah Linse, a freshman who crossed the finish line in 19:51.60, in fourth place overall. \n“This was the most pressured situation Mariah has ever faced, and she performed flawlessly,” Carstens said. “The pace started out fast, but she kept her composure and broke away from her pack with about 800 meters to go. It was a hard fought battle; running at State as a freshman will be an invaluable experience.” \nJoining his teammates at State is Jefferson junior Rylee Miller. Miller finished fourth overall with a time of 16:55.47 and will run at State for a third consecutive year. \n“Rylee had the best race of his season, and is coming into great form with one race left in the season,” said Carstens of Miller, who missed the first half of the season with a stress fracture. “After battling a major injury over the summer, he is only five seconds off of where he was last year at this meet.” \nMiller led the Eagles to a third-place team finish (105 points), but it was one place short of earning Jefferson its second team qualification in program history. \n“Coming into the meet we knew the team could finish in the top four teams. Deerfield/Cambridge and Pewaukee had great team races today, but I honestly feel these boys gave it everything they had,” said Carstens. \nEagle seniors Jesse Paucek (17:23.52) and Alex Anason (17:59.86) also had Top 20 finishes, placing 12th and 19th, respectively. \nThe top two teams and top five individuals not on those teams qualified for this weekend’s WIAA State Cross Country Meet to be held Saturday at Ridges Golf Course in Wisconsin Rapids. \nTwo local teams, the Deerfield/Cambridge boys and Whitewater girls, will represent Jefferson County at State. \nTop 20 performances by sophomores Will Kaashagen (11th, 17:18.88) and Spencer Currie (15th, 17:39.10), and senior Carson Kaashagen (20th, 18:02.29) led D/C to State as the United finished with 76 points, second behind only Sectional champion Pewaukee (41). \nSenior Jay Nikolay (22nd, 18:15.35) rounded out the Deerfield/Cambridge scoring. Junior Josh Niesen (36th, 18:30.92) and senior Parker Knapp (73rd, 20:03.22) also will run at State. \nThree area individual boys also qualified for State. Lakeside Lutheran junior Mitchell Georgi finished third (16:48.46), Whitewater junior Brodie Runez placed sixth (17:08.14), and Lake Mills senior Chase Scheel (9th, 17:11.66). \n“I got a bit nervous because at 2 miles he was starting to fade a bit from the leaders as the race began to break apart, but he dug deep and was able to reel in a few guys in front of him; he showed some great finishing speed when it mattered most,” said Whitewater coach Chad Carstens of Runez, a first-year runner. “Every race has been such a learning experience for him, and he will look to put it all together for one more effort at the Ridges in a week.” \nBehind the running of sophomore Allisan Barrett and senior Sarah Ziolkowski, the Whitewater girls were able to earn a team State qualification — and almost won the Sectional championship. The Whippets’ 62 points were just shy of champion Pewaukee’s 57. \n“This Sectional was absolutely loaded with five teams currently ranked in the state coaches poll, as well as many individuals, which would prove to be true when it all shook out. We flexed our muscles and were able to get the monkey off our back, after being narrowly denied state the previous two years and hammered our way to the finish,” said Chad Carstens. \nBarrett (20:02.41) and Ziolkowski (20:03.57) finished seventh and eighth, respectively. The WIAA State berth is a third straight for Ziolkowski. \n“These two have become quite the tandem as the team's frontrunners and feed off one another during the race. Allisan has been so consistent, and Sarah put her stamp on the race by putting forth her strongest effort yet,” said Chad Carstens. \nJoining their teammates at State will be seniors Andrea Sandoval (12th, 20:40.56) and Abby King (17th, 21:06.62), freshman Nicole Tomomitsu (18th, 21:17.25), senior Caleigh Judd (40th, 22:12.01) and Lan Vo (52nd, 22:41.51).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:18:38.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
