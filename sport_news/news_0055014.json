Opposing fans jawed back and forth until security had to restrain a flailing-armed Chargers fan and escort him away from his lower-bowl seats.\nThis near-skirmish unfortunately came as no surprise. The Chargers-Raiders rivalry is arguably as heated as it gets in West Coast professional sports.\nBut it could soon become a sibling rivalry, much like the NBA’s Lakers and Clippers. In February, San Diego and Oakland submitted a proposal to share a $1.7-billion stadium in Carson next year.\nThe pre-kickoff atmosphere certainly felt more like that of friendly sibling rivalry in Qualcomm’s packed parking lot Sunday.\nA chorus of young Raiders cheerleaders started a “Let’s go Raiders!” chant feet away from Chargers fans tailgating and watching football with a DirecTV dish weighed down by a cinderblock. Closer to the stadium, a Raiders fan and a Chargers fan high-fived after winning a grueling beer-pong battle together.\nScenes like this leave Omar Vivas, a Raiders devotee since 1982, with no reason to doubt both fan bases could co-exist in Carson.\n“Just looking right now, just from my eyes, do you see any problems?” Vivas said. “You’ve got Raiders and Chargers fans mixed everywhere and everybody’s barbecuing, having an awesome time.”\nVivas, along with all other 24 Raiders fans The Orange County Register spoke with, said he’d fully support the Raiders if they moved to Los Angeles. Many of those fans are already used to traveling to see their team in person.\n“They could be going all the way out of state - I’ll still be going,” said Victor Ricardo, a lifelong Raiders fan from Rialto.\nIt’s a different story with those dressed in gold and powder blue. Many Chargers supporters also saw no issue with the fan bases sharing a stadium, but only three out of 25 The Register spoke with said they’d root for a Los Angeles Chargers team.\nThat poll is in no way scientific. But it definitely validates the notion San Diego would leave many fans behind in the move, while Oakland likely wouldn’t face that problem.\n“If push comes to shove and the Chargers are in L.A., I’m no longer a Chargers fan,” said Wayne Hamburger, a Chargers fan since he moved to San Diego County in 1978. “… (San Diego) is where their backing is. There isn’t any backing for the Chargers in L.A. … I think the (Chargers president Dean) Spanos talk about 25 percent of their fan base is L.A. and Orange County is crap. Show me those numbers. I don’t believe that.”\nSan Diego is definitely fighting to keep its Chargers. Mayor Kevin Faulconer has met directly with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, presenting the case to keep pro football in his city.\nFan groups have organized rally after rally in hopes their voices can somehow sway the Chargers and their attorney Mark Fabiani, who stopped negotiating with the city in June.\n“You have guys on the radio begging you, pleading you not to go to L.A., and you’ve got the mayor behind you saying let’s work together,” said Jon Stewart, a 10-year Chargers season-ticket holder. “… It’s so upsetting.”\nIn order for a team to be relocated, it must file for relocation between Jan. 1 and Feb. 15 and get a three-fourths vote from the 32 NFL owners.\nCurrently, the Rams are the only other team considered to be in the Los Angeles sweepstakes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:10:18.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
