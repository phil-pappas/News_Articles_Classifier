Ebenhack Associated Press Florida running back Kelvin Taylor celebrates by jumping on quarterback Will Grier after the 38-10 win over Ole Miss on Saturday in Gainesville. \nGAINESVILLE | Some are calling it the flu game, in reference to Michael Jordan’s NBA Finals performance while suffering from flulike symptoms. \nWhile that’s probably taking it a little too far, Florida’s victory over then-No. 3 Ole Miss on Saturday night was still impressive considering the situation. \nIn the week leading up to the game, the Gators had 21 players battling the flu, including starting quarterback Will Grier. \nBefore the game, it wasn’t clear if Grier would even start the game due to his health. \nBut during the 38-10 rout— a performance that earned the No. 11 ranking for Florida in the latest AP poll — it was hard to see any side effects from the illness that caused the sick players to be quarantined for a 48-hour period. \n“It was not pretty,” Florida head coach Jim McElwain said of the illness. “They all went through some adversity and found a way to focus and go play. \n“All 21 of them did a heck of a job.” \nPart of the success might be credited to technology. \nDuring the days when the players were made to stay home, the coaches were able to send game film to the group to study on the players’ iPads. \nThe study sessions paid off for Grier, who went 24-of-29 for 271 yards and four touchdowns — by far the best performance of his young career. \nThe redshirt freshman attributed his success to his ability to still study even when he couldn’t show up to team activities. \n“You win the game throughout the week, so being able to still look at the game plan while you’re throwing up is really, really helpful,” Grier said. \nTight end Jake McGee was one of the beneficiaries of Grier’s night, catching six passes for 29 yards and his first touchdown as a Gator. \nBut the redshirt senior wasn’t willing to give his quarterback any extra credit for playing sick, saying that it’s just part of the position’s job description. \n“That’s what he’s supposed to do,” McGee said. “I don’t really care. He’s in there, his job is to throw the ball, hand the ball off. He can cough when he gets home.” \n“These games are too big to get sick.” \nWith the success of this week, maybe getting sick will be a new strategy for the Gators going forward. \nIt sounds like the Rebels might be considering it for future games. \n“I hope we have a bunch get the flu next week,” Ole Miss head coach Hugh Freeze said sarcastically after the game. “I think that’s something we need to look into.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:35:13.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
