Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: Are Aggies concerned about Tra Carson wearing down? They'd be in real trouble if he went down with an injury.\nHairopoulos : Yes. He's been a tried-and-true workhorse so far. Wish I could provide you an update on backup James White, but A&M won't reveal his status. Carson has had 69 of A&M's 154 rushes this season.\nQuestion: Saw where Sumlin said Kyler Murray was being used to help the Aggies pick up rushing yards when Carson needs a breather. I know Murray's scrambling ability is exceptional but designed runs seem pretty risky for such a little guy. Why don't they just put in another running back?\nHairopoulos : As we touched on before, the Aggies are short on running backs at the moment. With James White knocked out after just a couple plays in the season opener, they've been using Kwame Etwi and Brice Dolezal to spell Carson at running back. They've even brought cornerback Brandon Williams back over briefly. I think the best thing about bringing Murray in to run the ball is that it forces defenses to change what they're doing. It also makes them prepare for it leading up to the game. At the same time, Murray is going to have to throw the ball, too, or defenses will eventually be able to get to him. If they can catch him. He's slippery.\nQuestion: If both teams agreed to it, could A&M and Mississippi State both wear maroon Saturday?\nHairopoulos : Not totally up on the uniform rules, but I don't believe so. Think there has to be a contrast between the two.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/chats/2015/09/23/kate-hairopoulos-answers-texas-amsec-questions-3-pm-wednesday-sept-30-ask-now?hootPostID=6a3da5c44a6a9fe3981fd7def88d217c"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:42:32.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
