The tip-off will be presented by LiUNA 625. \nThis will be the first time an NBL Canada team will face a D-League opponent. \nThe Raptors 905 is the official affiliate of the Toronto Raptors of the NBA. This coming 2015-16 season will be the inaugural year of competition for the Raptors 905 franchise, who play their home games at the Hershey Centre in Mississauga. The Raptors 905 is the first Canadian-based NBA D-League team. \n“We are excited to play our first Raptors 905 exhibition game as a franchise in Windsor,” said Dan Tolzman, the Raptors 905 GM. “The Express is one of the top teams in the NBL and will provide our team with a great challenge as we prepare for this inaugural NBA D-League season.” \n“We’re really proud to have the opportunity to play a league that is well established, well-founded and that provides great competitiveness for our own teams,” said Express president and CEO Dartis Willis. “We’re excited about it.” \nIn an effort to continue to support the local community, the Express has selected Transition to Betterness (T2B) to be the benefitting charitable partner of the game. T2B is a local grass roots charity dedicated to providing comfort for patients and families impacted by a life altering illness. \nFifty per cent of all ticket sales will be donated to T2B, along with proceeds from the 50/50 draw and other prize raffle draws. \nGeneral admission tickets are only $5.00 while reserved courtside tickets are available for just $10, although seating is limited. \nTickets will go on sale on October 20 at 10:00 am at the Teksavvy.com box office inside the WFCU Centre.
