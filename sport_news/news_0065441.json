Crookston finished with 298 points, with Thief River Falls in second with 194 and Perham in third with 174. “The team is definitely locked in,” head coach Marley Melbye said. “I’m looking forward to see what the Pirates are able to do come the end of the season.” The Pirates won nine of the eleven events (for full results, check box score below), but were especially dominant in the 200 IM. “The 200 Individual Medley really stood out to me, because for the Pirates to be able to take 1st, 2nd and 3rd is extremely unusual in the competitive world,” Melbye said. “Then you dive in closer and see that they were all within a second of each other and the three athletes cutting a combined eight seconds is pretty amazing.” The Pirates had several other strong races, taking the top two spots in both the 200 and 400 Freestyle relays, and the top two spots in the 500 Free. “We had a lot of races that stood out at the meet,” Melbye said. “Our team really came prepared for the meet and determined to take this one home.” The 400 Free was highlighted by not just a win from the “A” relay team of Crookston, but a strong performance from the “B” team as well, which took second, and saw one swimmer set a personal record split. “The race was extremely close throughout the entire race and then we watched Elizabeth Erdman swim her fastest split ever in her 100 freestyle,” Melbye said. In the shorter events, it was once again Haley Roed who led the Pirates with another strong day. “Haley continued to have a great meet putting up her best times of the year, and winning both of her events by over a body length,” Melbye said. The Pirates now have ten days off before their next meet, but will be busy in the water. “During the 10 days before our next meet we will focus on the little things in a race: breath control, turns and starts,” Melbye said. “The athletes are obviously looking really strong in the water and endurance is right on track so let’s take this time and fine tune the races.” Melbye also noted that the swimmers will be focusing in on their specific strokes as the team gets closer to Conference and Section time. The next meet is a home quadrangular on Tuesday, October 20 when the Pirates play host to Grand Forks Central, Red River, and Thief River Falls starting at 5:00 p.m. Pirate Top Five Finishes Page 2 of 2 - Name Event Place Marietta Geist 200 Free Relay 1st Sierra Pry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:27:47.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
