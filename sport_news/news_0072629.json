According to a press release from Clarksville High late Friday afternoon, the school has reported to the TSSAA that it discovered one of its football players is ineligible. \nThe Wildcats just wrapped up a 17-14 victory against Northeast Thursday to move to 6-2 on the season and 3-2 in Region 7-5A play but all but one of those victories are now gone. \nThe school said the football player was a transfer student from out of state prior to school starting, and his new local permanent residence was not in the Clarksville High zone. The school had been given an address in the Clarksville High zone, which was used as a secondary residence. \n“This is difficult for a team that has worked very hard, but I believe we will come out of this stronger and continue to be committed to offering a quality athletic program,\" Clarksville principal Jean Luna said. \"Clarksville High is a school rich in pride and tradition and we have no doubt that our football team will finish this season as strong as they started.” \nClarksville athletics director Shannon Cummings expressed similar sentiments. \n“We are committed to playing fair and ensuring that rules are followed even when the consequences are heavy for the other players, their families and coaches,\" Cummings said. \"When we submit information to TSSAA, we believe it to be accurate. However, Clarksville High was provided with inaccurate information in regards to permanent residence.” \nAccording to Friday's press release, the TSSAA had yet to respond to the reported findings or communicate to the school the consequence of playing an ineligible player but in a phone interview with The Leaf-Chronicle early Friday evening, Wildcats coach Isaac Shelby said his team already knew the punishment would be the forfeiture of five of its six wins. The player in question did not play against Northeast Thursday night. \nShelby said the school must send a letter to all the teams Clarksville High has beaten this season informing those schools that the Wildcats forfeit those wins. That includes region wins against West Creek and Rossview as well as wins against Station Camp, Kenwood and Springfield. \n\"I think that makes our record 1-7 and 1-4 in region,\" Shelby said. \"That knocks us out (of the 5A playoffs). We were basically in after Thursday's win and now we're out. Obviously that's really tough on our kids.\" \nShelby said he informed his own team Friday of the forfeits and what it means to the Wildcats' season. \n\"They were upset,\" Shelby said. \"The coaches were upset, kids were upset and I've been upset for a few days going through the process of it.\" \nShelby would not elaborate on who the ineligible player is but that he started at wide receiver for the Wildcats and that he had a sister who played for Clarksville High's soccer team. However, that soccer player did not play any varsity games, according to soccer coach Jeff Jordan, so the Lady Wildcats will not have to forfeit any soccer games. The Lady Wildcats – the defending Class 3A state champs – beat Henry County to win its fourth straight District 10-AAA tournament title Thursday. \n\"I promoted four JV players to varsity a week ago but she wasn't one of those players,\" Jordan said. \"We were just lucky on that because I played those promoted JV players in the first round of our district tournament. Meanwhile, the girl in question was one of the ball girls during the (tournament) game. My season would have been done for nothing more than trying to be nice and build self-esteem.\" \nShelby said the ineligible player's family moved to Clarksville from out of state this past summer and filled out the necessary paperwork. But it wasn't until earlier this week that the Clarksville-Montgomery County School System was made aware of a possible zoning violation. No explanation was made about how CMCSS became aware. \n\"I feel bad for everyone involved,\" Shelby added. \"I feel bad for our players, our students and the family involved. It's a difficult situation. We'll have to move on obviously and make the best of this. We talk a lot about pride in our school tradition and in our school. We also talked to our players about this being a great opportunity to show your character through these last couple of games.\" \nCHS has a bye next week during Fall Break before wrapping up the season at home against Dickson County (Oct. 23) and at Brentwood High a week later. \nReach Prep writer George Robinson at 931-245-0747 and on Twitter @Cville_Sports.
