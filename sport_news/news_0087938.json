That gave the Cubs a season record of 97-65. All the while, they were watching the scoreboard to see how the Pittsburgh Pirates were faring against the Cincinnati Reds. The Pirates won 4-0, so the Cubs will travel to Pittsburgh for Wednesday night's one-game wild-card playoff, the winner advancing to the NL division series. The Cubs got 6 strong innings from starting pitcher Dan Haren, who gave up 3 hits. The Cubs scored 3 runs in the first inning against Brewers starter Jorge Lopez. Austin Jackson was hit by a pitch to begin the game. Chris Coghlan and Kris Bryant walked to load the bases. Anthony Rizzo then singled to right field to drive in 2 runs, giving him 101 RBI for the season. A double-play grounder by Starlin Castro scored the third run.
