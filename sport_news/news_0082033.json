Like this week when he called out the media for burying Alabama after its loss to Ole Miss and for those of us that considered his 2-point underdog Crimson Tide wasn't good enough to win in Athens. \nAfter losing at home to Ole Miss, a game that five turnovers had a lot to do with the outcome, and wins over Wisconsin, Middle Tennessee and Louisiana-Monroe, what did we have to work with? After starting the season with Jake Coker and Cooper Bateman splitting time at quarterback, then the offense converting just 2-of-13 first downs against La.-Monroe with Coker going the distance, what made anyone think Alabama 38, Georgia 10?Saban, of course, loves this because he gets to play the us-against-the-world card. And now Alabama would appear to be back on track chasing an SEC West title — it could use another Ole Miss loss, though — and making another College Football Playoff. \nWinning out won't be easy with 16-point underdog Arkansas visiting Saturday on homecoming, No. 9 Texas A&M next week in College Station, Tennessee the next week and No. 7 LSU coming to town Nov. 7. Mississippi State in Starkville Nov. 14 isn't a picnic either and Auburn at the end of the season, who knows.A&M and LSU are easily the most dangerous because they both have an open date before playing the Tide. \nWin out, and it's back to the playoffs. \nBury Alabama? No one's buried the 4-1 Tide that I know of. Some of us might still need persuading the offense is not a liability. We like the defense, but wonder if it can contain a duel-threat quarterback such as A&M's Kyle Allen and Tennessee's Josh Dobbs and Mississippi State's Dak Prescott. LSU's Brandon Harris is more runner than passer and that could be a problem. \nThis week's picks: \nArkansas vs. Alabama The Razorbacks (2-3) almost spoiled Alabama's season last year, leading after three quarters before the Tide scored early in the fourth to pull out a 14-13 win — its eighth straight in the series. Arkansas was supposed to be much scarier this season, but losing leading rusher Jonathan Williams in August sucked a lot of air out of the offense. Williams was the 10th leading rusher in school history with 2,321 yards, including 1,190 last season when he led to the Razorbacks to a 7-6 record and Texas Bowl win over Texas. Alex Collins has stepped in, averaging 158.3 rushing yards in the past three games. Brandon Allen is one of the league's most experienced quarterbacks. But the matchup to watch, that could determine the game, is Arkansas' beefy offensive line and Alabama's massive defensive front that features 312-pound A'Shawn Robinson and 313-pound Jarran Reed at ends and 315-pound Darren Lake at nose guard, with the top backups running 315, 294 and 283 pounds. Arkansas' offensive line averages 327.6 pounds per man.
