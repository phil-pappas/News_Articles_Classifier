With the game scoreless at halftime, Burris coach Harald Leusmann reminded his team that they were playing on artificial turf and the ball rolls faster, to use shorter passes and not over kick. \nThe team responded by scoring two goals, the first by Devin Rubush and the second by Max Alvarado. The Owls sit at 11-5-2 on the season and will face the winner of Thursday's Heritage Christian/Northwestern game on Saturday. \n\"We scored that first goal right after halftime, and it calmed down our play,\" Leusmann said. \"Crawfordsville got stronger at that point, but our final goal really sealed the deal. I'm very proud of how the team played against a good opponent.\" \nOwls goalie Ricky Tellez finished the game with seven saves and the shutout. \nKokomo 5, Yorktown 1 \nYorktown's season came to an end, falling 5-1 to Kokomo at the Kokomo Regional. \nAfter falling behind 3-0 in the first half, Max Furnish scored the lone Yorktown goal to cut the deficit to 3-1 going into halftime, but Kokomo had too much power. \n\"Kokomo had a lot of speed up top and a lot of skilled ball handlers, they broke through and their skill won the day,\" Yorktown coach Kameron McBride said. \"We played hard and made chances, but didnâ€™t finish enough.\" \nSenior Karter Bibbs led the Tigers with 16 goals on the season. Peter McFarland manned the net, averaging just over 10 saves per game, including 12 in the loss to Kokomo. 92 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1LwtRZB TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:58:23.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
