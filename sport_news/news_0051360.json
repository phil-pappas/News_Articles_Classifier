But the Missionaries were forced to settle for a third-place finish at the Northwest Conference Fall Classic at the par-72 Woodlands Course of the Sunriver Resort. The Missionaries (335-322—657) finished nine strokes back of runner-up Whitworth (325-323—648) and five up on fourth-place Lewis & Clark College (343-319—662). Day 1 leader George Fox (309-314—623) wasn’t able to equal Saturday’s hot start, but held on for the team victory. Whitman was led by fourth-place Phoebe Nguyen’s 10-over par 154 (79-75). She was one of the only golfers among the top players to trim strokes off her card from Saturday to Sunday. Individual medalist Sydney Maluenda (73-77—150) from George Fox hung on to edge out Chelsea Bayley (75-77—152) of Whitworth and Kristin Elich (76-76—152) of Fox for the victory. Nguyen’s teammate, Kendall Dunovant (100-86—186), was able to bounce back on Day 2 more than any other golfer in the field, working her way around the Woodlands layout Sunday with growing confidence in chopping off 14 strokes to climb four spots into a 28th-place finish. Whitman placed three golfers in the top seven on the final leaderboard. Joining Nguyen were Alyssa Maine (78-80—158), who finished sixth, and Shiyang Fan (78-81—159), who placed seventh. Charlotte Simons, working back from an injury, also closed the weekend by cutting strokes, carding a 113 Sunday after posting a 124 in windy — gusts up to 30 miles-per-hour — conditions Saturday. The Fall Classic, the first of the league’s three “majors,” marks a pause in the 2015-16 schedule, with the spring schedule resuming in March 2016.
