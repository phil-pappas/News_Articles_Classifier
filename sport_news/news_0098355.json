Although Colorado boasts one of the most educated adult populations in the nation, the truth is we don't even come close to filling that need.\nGone are the days when we can rely on importing talent. We must grow our own. But today, Colorado ranks in the bottom half of all states for our college-aged population attending college, which won't cut it for our business community.\nThe Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce supports 2A because it's a real strategy to increase college access and completion for our kids. The College Matters proposal is focused on the student, not the institution, and students are paid only after they have successfully completed a semester.\nThe chamber has a history of supporting public investments that provide a high rate of return. A generation of Denver students who achieve post-secondary credentials will enter our workforce better prepared and will generate earnings, spending and tax revenues.\nAdvertisement These students will have dramatically lower unemployment, more resilience during economic downturns and impose fewer demands on the social services we all pay for. Like the Denver Preschool Program, by investing in our kids up front, our city stands to save on the costs associated with unemployment â€” costs the city invests in now like social services, workforce development and even the criminal justice system.\nFederal and state budget cuts mean that local government must find solutions to address its priorities. Other cities have already taken steps to do just that, including Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago and New York. Even here, Weld County implemented a local tax credit to fund scholarships, and Pueblo County will vote in November for a marijuana excise tax for tuition grants.\nOur smart, healthy and qualified workforce is why companies want to do business here. Measure 2A is an investment that will provide taxpayers long-term results. It's an economic imperative.\nKelly Brough is president and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:03:39.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
