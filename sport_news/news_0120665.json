Mathieu pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting theft.\nThe two former Zulu queens were among 20 people named in a federal indictment that alleged a scheme prosecutors say bilked Medicare out of $30 million.\nProsecutors said Crinel's company, Abide Home Care Services, routinely falsified diagnoses so Medicare reimbursements were inflated, and falsified medical records that supported medically unnecessary home health services.\nAs part of her plea deal, court records show Crinel could face up to 10 years in prison on the conspiracy charge and up to five years in prison on the kickback charge. She could face up to a $250,000 fine on each charge.\nMathieu could face up to one year in prison and/or a fine of up to $100,000.\nU.S. Disrict Judge Susie Morgan is scheduled to sentence them Jan. 13. Both women will remain free until then.\nIn a document filed Friday detailing the evidence against Crinel, prosecutors said she \"violated the basic principle as a Medicare provider not to 'knowingly present or cause to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment by Medicare, and not submit claims with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.\"\nCrinel also admitted to giving kickbacks to doctors in return for patient referrals.\nMathieu, a nurse at Abide, was paid $48,794.69 between July 2, 2012, and March 18, 2014, for performing false and fraudulent home health certifications for medically unnecessary services, according to federal court records listing the evidence against her.\nIn one case, prosecutors wrote, Mathieu billed Medicare $125 for a visit to a patient whose paperwork said the patient had arthropathy, peripheral neuropathy and low vision. Medical records showed the patient never was diagnosed with those illnesses, the court records said.\nAs part of Crinel's plea deal, prosecutors agreed to drop felony charges against her daughter, Wilneisha Harrison Jakes, and to allow Jakes to plead guilty only to a state misdemeanor charge. Jakes was the company's chief administrator.\nTwo other defendants, Threasa Adderley, a physician, and Rhonda Maeerry, also pleaded guilty Friday for their role in the scheme. Crinel also entered a guilty plea for her company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:54:12.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
