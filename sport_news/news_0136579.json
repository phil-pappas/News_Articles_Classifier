So while it’s easy to point out they were eight games ahead of the Blue Jays in late July and didn’t win the AL East, this is one season where you have to give Joe Girardi some credit. He takes a beating a times from fans and media who joke about The Binder, about how Girardi is too wedded to the book.\nBut this is a year when the Yankees entered the season with so many questions. There were publications and Web sites that picked them last in the AL East.\nNaturally, no one could have anticipated the renaissance of Alex Rodriguez or the MVP-level play from Mark Teixeira until he suffered a leg fracture on a foul ball that ended his season. CC Sabathia somehow made 29 starts. Nathan Eovaldi became a staff ace until he went down in September. The bullpen has been uneven for weeks when someone other than Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller is on the mound.\nAnd the Yankees have still survived. Although it seems like they have had plenty of ups and downs, they’ve actually been pretty consistent even when you consider all of their starting pitchers have had at least one stint on the disabled list. They were 48-40 at the All-Star break and entered Saturday 39-32 since.\nWhile it’s true the Blue Jays came from far back, the Yankees didn’t really blow the lead. When somebody goes 43-16, like Toronto has done since it was 50-51, you just tip your hat to them.\n“We basically played the same the first half as we did the second half, in a sense,” Girardi told reporters after Friday’s game in Baltimore was rained out. “The other club played out of their minds and that’s not something that you can predict that’s going to happen. We had a lot of challenges that we had to overcome. Now everything becomes a short series and anything can happen.”\nOne reason the Blue Jays won the East and the Yankees didn’t points to the general manager’s office. Alex Anthopoulos went head-first into deals for the likes of Troy Tulowitzki and David Price knowing his job was in jeopardy and beloved president Paul Beeston is heading into retirement. The Blue Jays haven’t been in the postseason since 1993 and their urgency has never been higher.\nNormally, that’s the Yankees style but GM Brian Cashman took a cautious approach this time. Teams calling about prospects had no chance to get first baseman Greg Bird, pitcher Luis Severino or outfielder Aaron Judge. Bird and Severino graduated from Scranton and became standouts in the big leagues, with Bird’s 11 home runs in Teixeira’s absence proving a huge help.\nThe Yankees simply haven’t developed many prospects since their Core Four. With Derek Jeter finally into retirement, they knew they had to change. Cashman may have sacrificed the AL East this year but he still snuck into the playoffs – and kept the team in much better shape for future years.\nThis will be the Yankees’ first trip to postseason without Jeter since 1995. They have Didi Gregorious in that spot now, a player who developed nicely over the season after looking overmatched in April. He’s been one of several surprises in the Bronx this year. The Yankees celebrated their wild-card clincher Thursday night and a lot of people wondered what the fuss was about. After all, it was just a wild card.\nOf course, who was in the World Series last year? Two wild-cards, San Francisco and Kansas City. You battle for 159 games and make it, you deserve to celebrate. And the Yankees did. Their stay might be short, as short as one game. But the way things have broken for them this year, even one game is noteworthy.\nTough break for Colavito\n• Indians legend Rocky Colavito broke some surprising news to Cleveland Plain Dealer columnist Terry Pluto last week when Pluto innocently called the 82-year-old on the 60th anniversary of his first big-league hit. Colavito revealed he had his right leg amputated just below the knee on Aug. 11, the day after he turned 82. It was a result of type 2 diabetes.\n“They had to take the leg off, but I still have the knee,” Colavito said. “I’m so grateful for that. There have been no infections. The surgery went great. I don’t want anyone’s pity.”\nAs Pluto noted, Colavito was in Cleveland in 2013 for his 80th birthday to throw a first pitch. Now he’s lost a leg.\n“That’s life,” said Colavito, who will be fitted with a prosthesis next month. “I’ll just say that none of us should ever take all the good things for granted. Especially your health.”\nBucs keep it light\nThe Blue Jays and Pirates both wondered how they should celebrate clinching at least a wild-card. In Pittsburgh’s case, the NL Central was pretty much out of reach and this was going to be its only chance to take note of a third straight postseason berth.\nBut when the Bucs wrapped up their spot last week in Denver, there was simply a champagne toast and no wild sprays like there were for them the last two years – or there were in the Blue Jays’ clubhouse in Toronto last weekend. This is a franchise, remember, that had a losing record for 20 straight seasons before this run of postseason appearances.\n“I was a little surprised we even did anything,” ace Gerrit Cole told Pittsburgh reporters. “Our sights are set a little bit farther down the road.”\n“It just shows me a lot of growth on their part,” said manager Clint Hurdle. “They wanted to celebrate appropriately, and we’ve still got things in front of us we need to take care of.”\nThe Blue Jays had initially planned to do nothing until they clinched the AL East, and lockers weren’t even covered in plastic. But Edwin Encarnacion – who had played nearly 1,300 big-league games without making the postseason – decided things would go down otherwise and the sprays began. Fun police aside, it’s hard to argue his point.\nDiamond dust\n• Anatomy of a trade that went perfectly is found in David Price’s numbers with the Blue Jays: 9-1 in 11 starts with a 2.30 ERA. In 74∑ innings, Price allowed just 57 hits and 18 walks while striking out 87. That’s 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings and a WHIP of 1.1.\n• Ever the forward thinker, Cubs manager Joe Maddon has pretty much eliminated batting practice for his team in the second half of the season. With late-night flights and more day games than any other team, Maddon was most interested in maintaining his players’ energy and not wearing them out with extra swings and more time in the hot summer sun.\n“Hitting on the field has really no specific purpose at this time of year other than fans watching it,” Maddon told the Wall Street Journal. “It’s the most overrated thing we do on a daily basis.”\n• Mariners reliever Tony Zych broke a 105-year-old record when he made his big-league debut as a September callup. The September callup became the last player alphabetically in MLB’s all-time player registry. He took over from Dutch Zwilling, who made his debut with the White Sox in 1910.\nOddly enough, Seattle also has a piece of the first player on the list in reliever David Aardsma. He took over from Hank Aaron in 2004 while pitching for the Giants and was with the Mariners in 2009-10.\n• Former Niagara star Wynton Bernard, 25, was named an Eastern League all-star outfielder while playing for Erie in the Tigers chain. He batted .301 and led the league in both hits (161) and stolen bases (43). A 35th-round draft pick by the Padres, Bernard was signed by the Tigers last year out of a spring tryout camp. Also in the Eastern League, former Bisons catcher Dusty Wathan was named manager of the year after leading Reading in the Phillies chain to Game Five of the finals before losing to Bowie (Orioles).\nemail: mharrington@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:47:35.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
