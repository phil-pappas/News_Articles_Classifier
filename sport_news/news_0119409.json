They've improved to 23rd in scoring defense (17.8 points per game) from 107th (34.0). \nThey might take the most pride in holding opponents' running games in check. They're allowing 126 rushing yards per game, 33rd in the nation, after giving up 239.2 a year ago to rank 115th. \n\"We were one of the worst defenses stopping the run,\" said junior Dawuane Smoot, who plays the \"leo\" position, an end/linebacker hybrid. \"There's a chip on our shoulders.\" \nSmoot, who ranks third in the Big Ten with 8 1/2 tackles for a loss, said coaches \"ran us through hell\" in the offseason. \n\"They really prepared us,\" he said. \nIncreasing the defense's overall strength also has made a difference. \n\"This is the first time I've been here that the defensive line looks like a Big Ten defensive line,\" interim coach Bill Cubit said, noting the starting front four of Smoot, end Jihad Ward and tackles Chunky Clements and Rob Bain. \"Before, we weren't big enough and strong enough and we were getting knocked out of gaps. Now we're holding the gaps.\" \nBig Ten Network analyst Chuck Long said that the Illini were wise to stick with Banks and that Banks made the right choice in not changing his system. \n\"He was under a lot of pressure the last couple years, but he had a young crew,\" Long said of Banks, who was made co-coordinator this season with Mike Phair. \"Often either the defensive coordinator tries to change too much or (the school) changes the defensive coordinator. That's a great example of staying with it. They've allowed their players to get older and better. He hung on to what he believed in, and now they're older and more experienced.\" \nIt's important to note Illinois did not fare so well defensively at North Carolina, giving up 471 yards in a 48-14 blowout. \nIowa boasts one of the most balanced offenses in the Big Ten and ranks third in the conference in scoring with 32.2 points per game. The Hawkeyes scored only 10 last week in a four-point victory at Wisconsin. \nIllinois players understand they have not completely overhauled their reputation. \n\"There's still a lot more work to do,\" Smoot said. \"There's a lot more to prove and a lot more games to play.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:26:18.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
