Thus, Kumar flouted the NSDC – or simply the sports code – which demands a cooling-off period of four years before a secretary seeks re-election after two successive terms. But Kumar was unanimously elected as JFI president during its annual general meeting in Imphal without serving the cooling-off period.\nWhile the sports ministry showed remarkable courage in issuing the marching orders to the JFI chief, it is still playing the waiting game in the case of All India Tennis Association (AITA) president Anil Khanna, who has been given a show cause notice on similar charges.\nKhanna has also been under pressure for flouting the tenure guidelines of the sports code. Khanna held the post of secretary general in AITA between 2000 and 2012 before taking over as president in October last year without serving the cooling-off period.\nAITA has been threatening to drag the ministry to the court over this issue.\n“It’s Khanna’s influential personality and the clout he commands in the Indian sporting circle that is making it hard for the ministry to take any action against him,” a source in the sports ministry said.\nThe ministry’s action against Kumar came after consulting the law ministry, which suggested that Kumar should step down.\nIf Kumar refuses to quit, the JFI can be de-recognised, just like the Archery Association of India. In that scenario, Kumar will also have to resign as the secretary general of the Judo Union of Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:13:10.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
