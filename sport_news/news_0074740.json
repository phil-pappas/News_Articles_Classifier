This month, hear these two former Mavericks' first-hand stories and experiences about their days with \"the battered bastards of baseball.\" While we can't show the award-winning documentary Battered Bastards of Baseball (due to Netflix contractual rights), we will show the film trailer, followed by short presentations by Peters and Colton. Then we'll open it up to the audience for Q&A and see where the night goes.\nSounds like a blast.
