Murray, who was born in Gladstone and raised in Souris, will be inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame this weekend. \nAndy Murray won’t be able to attend his induction ceremony into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame on Saturday, but it’s not his moment in the sun that he’s upset about missing. \nIt’s his uncle’s. \nThe longtime coach from Souris said his uncle, Del Murray, was part of the \n1953-54 Dauphin Kings team that will be inducted as well. A second uncle, the late Bob Hucal, also played with the Kings. \n\"That’s disappointing to me that I’m not going to be there for them because it’s such a big deal,\" said Murray, who is unable to take part because he is busy preparing for the season with the Western Michigan University Broncos. \"I’m disappointed for a lot of reasons, but that’s a major one.\" \nHe’s also worked with fellow inductee John Paddock and would like to be on hand to see him honoured at the event in Winnipeg. \nThe other Westman flavour at the ceremony will be the induction of former NHL players Sheldon Kennedy of Elkhorn and Curt Ridley of Minnedosa. \nMurray is in his fifth season as the head coach of the Kalmazoo-based Broncos of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. \nHe said the final roster decisions are currently being made so the timing isn’t good because the Broncos play on the weekend. \nMurray said the only time he’s ever missed a game is just after he was in a bad car accident and the Los Angeles Kings wouldn’t let him coach with a concussion. \n\"It’s always been my philosophy that it’s all about the players,\" Murray said on Wednesday from a rink in Muskegon, Mich., where he was scouting recruits. \"I always say before players care how much you know, they want to know how much you care. That’s just the way I go about my business.\" \nAs much as selling automobiles is part of the Murray family business, so is hockey. Murray’s grandparents and parents were passionate supporters of the game in Souris. \nBoth of Murray’s sons, Brady and Jordan, are currently playing professionally in Switzerland, while his 26-year-old daughter Sarah coaches the South Korean women’s team. \nAndy Murray was given his first coaching job in 1976 at age 25 when the Brandon Travellers of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League fired their bench boss in training camp and needed somebody. He jokes that he feels sorry for those early players because, while he was passionate, he’s not sure he knew what he was doing. \nHis coaching path subsequently led him to Brandon University, Europe, the National Hockey League and back to university. \n\"As I like to tell everyone, I’m just trying to avoid getting a real job,\" Murray chuckled. \nNow 64, Murray leaves for the office every morning at 5:45 because he enjoys being around the players and loves the job. He recently signed a five-year contract but said he now goes year to year. \n\"As long as I still love doing it, I’m going to continue,\" Murray said. \"Life’s too short to not do what you want.\" \nHe has had opportunities to return to the NHL but turned them down because he’s happy where he is. \nIn a way, the coaching fraternity is finally catching up to a path he helped blaze. Murray, who was once voted one of the most innovative coaches in the NHL, said he’s a \n\"You coach within your own personality and who you are,\" Murray said. \"I like to think that I’m a hard worker and detail-oriented person. I always got this handle as a tactical coach; all that stuff now is kind of seen as part of coaching. Before I was seen as being almost too analytical, but I knew that there was an advantage in doing all those things. Now it’s common practice. \n\"I consider this one even better for me because I’m being recognized by my home province,\" Murray said. \"I think it’s really special. I’m very appreciative and grateful. \nMurray’ \nIt’ \n\"I always felt, wherever I was coaching for Canada or in the NHL, that I was representing the coaching fraternity back in Manitoba,\" Murray said. \"All my friends in Souris and in the Westman area, I was representing them so I pushed myself to work hard and do things the right way. If I wasn’ \n\"That’s why it’s special to be recognized. \n»", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:54:51.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
