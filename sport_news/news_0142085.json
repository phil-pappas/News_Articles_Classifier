He dished to linemate Johnny Gaudreau, who spied a hard-charging Giordano. \nMonahan was hanging around in case of a rebound, but Calgary's captain finished it off with a slick deke to his backhand. \n\"I was exhausted. It was nice to see that one go in,\" Monahan said. \"I'm happy for Gio and happy for the team.\" \nMonahan reached the 100-point plateau -- he has 55 goals and 45 helpers in 163 big-league outings so far -- at the ripe ol' age of 21 years and 12 days. \nIn Flames' lore, only Dan Quinn (19 years, 279 days) was younger when he achieved that milestone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:49:13.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
