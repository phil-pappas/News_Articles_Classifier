He accounted for 51 rushing yards and a touchdown on a 16-yard run that got the Bearcats on the board, and caught a 29-yard pass. To put that into perspective he carried for 34 yards on seven carries all of last year and had exactly one 4-yard carry for the junior high as a freshman. \nAfter throwing for 52 yards in the nonconference portion of the schedule, Hayden Fennell has thrown for 291 in two weeks of conference play. Want more perspective, his 343 yard total to date is already more than the 306 the Bearcats combined (four passers) to throw for last year and it’s only 106 shy of the 2013 championship season passing total. \nTHIS DATE IN BEARCAT HISTORY: The Bearcats are 10-2-1 all time in games documented to have been played on Oct. 9. More often than not the opponent has been Mansfield (7-0-1). \nNotable performances on the date include the first ever 5 2-point conversion game against Mansfield in a 46-0 win over Mansfield on Oct. 9, 1970. Ray Asbury scored two of the 2s. \nThe most recent Oct. 9 game was in 2009 when Talor Tatterson ran for 72 yards on one play and 164 in the game in a 28-21 win over Pottsville. Brock May also had a 68-yard TD run that night. \nBrandon Rowland started the 10-9-1998 game at Lavaca with a kickoff return for a touchdown. It was called back. He scored on the first offensive play from 89 yards out. Rowland finished with 164 and the Bearcats won 53-0. \nRandy May ran for 164 yards on Oct. 9, 1992 in a 48-13 win over Mansfield; Garfield Hodges had a 79-yard run against Mansfield on Oct. 9, 1959, but he didn’t score. The Bearcats won 21-13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:38:37.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
