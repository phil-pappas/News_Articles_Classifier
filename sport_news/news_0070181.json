It is a place where Ryan Goins normally operates with skill and decisiveness.\nBut on this day, with the Blue Jays and David Price in full control — having set down 18 Kansas City Royals in a row — Goins went out hunting a high pop-up off the bat of Ben Zobrist leading off the seventh inning, a play he’s made dozens of times this season. He clearly had a bead on it and then, at the last second, sensing the presence of Jose Bautista coming in, turned away.\nThe ball fell between the two fielders and the spell that Price had cast over the Royals was shattered. A five-run K.C. rally erupted on its way to a 6-3 victory to take a 2-0 lead in the American League Championship Series.\nRECAP: Late rally sinks @BlueJays in Game 2 of #ALCS : http://t.co/dt48A0mpcO pic.twitter.com/aGdrjBB8bp\n— Toronto Blue Jays (@BlueJays) October 17, 2015 “Pretty much a routine fly ball,” said Goins. “I just lost track of where I was in the field. Thought I heard something that I didn’t. I backed off the ball. Should have been more aggressive.\n“I stuck my glove up. It’s kind of the sign for ‘I’ve got it.’ I think I did it two or three times. I thought late I heard something. I thought I heard an ‘I got it’. It was nothing.”\nI challenge ANYONE to play the full tape of my post-game interview and then make your own conclusions. Nice try.\n— Jose Bautista (@JoeyBats19) October 18, 2015 The Jays were holding a 3-0 lead, a lead that could have been double that with a bounce here or there, but three runs should have been good enough, the way Price was dealing.\nHowever, the Kansas City Royals are nothing if not opportunists. Given that trickle of snow, the mighty avalanche began to slide down the mountain. Lorenzo Cain singled. Eric Hosmer singled in a run. Kendrys Morales’ groundball out scored a second run. Mike Moustakas singled in the tying run and the tsunami had become unstoppable. Alex Gordon’s double gave K.C. the lead and it didn’t end there. Just for good measure Alex Rios delivered a sixth base hit to make the score 5-3. They added another in the eighth and the Blue Jays, stunned, had no answer.\n“We’re still up three (runs) and it’s late in the game,” said Bautista. “There’s a man on first. You don’t think it’s going to open up a five-run inning. That’s the kind of team they are. You give them a little chance and they strung a few hits together. One small mistake opened the door for them and they took advantage.”\nThat faux pas broke the spell Price had cast on the Royals hitters. When the dust cleared, the Royals had sent nine men to the plate and had delivered five singles and a double to deliver a serious body blow to the Blue Jays hopes.\nWhat made this meltdown even more outrageous was the fact that Price had, to that point, pitched as well as he had at any time this season, allowing just a leadoff single to Alcides Escobar. Kansas City didn’t have another base-runner until the fateful seventh.\n“I felt good with all my pitches. I was able to mix it up. I just gave up hits at the wrong time,” said Price. “I don’t think I struggled. It was frustrating, but I don’t think I struggled. That’s baseball.\n“I was staying in the moment. It just didn’t work out.”\nThe bottom line now is that, after this shocker, the Jays are in trouble. They’re down two games in this ALCS and that is bad news. In the history of the ALCS, the winner of Game 2 has won the series 23 of 29 times. That includes 14 of the past 16.\nThe one hope the Jays have is that they are coming back to Toronto, where they are just as dominant as the Royals have been at home this year.\nIn the battle between the two starters, Royals’ Yordano Ventura blinked first, surrendering back-to-back doubles to Kevin Pillar and Goins leading off the third inning to put Toronto out in front 1-0. That’s the way it remained until the sixth inning when the Jays sent eight men to the plate, yet scored only twice.\nJosh Donaldson led off the inning and got a second life when his high pop foul behind the plate ticked the wire holding up the backstop with Kansas City catcher Sal Perez camped under it. Perez made the barehanded catch but the ball was dead as soon as it touched the wire.\nDonaldson made that reprieve stand up when he beat out a slow bouncer to the shortstop for an infield single. Bautista followed with a walk and then Edwin Encarnacion, bad hand and all, drove in the Jays’ second run with a single that leaked through the left side. One out later, Troy Tulowitzki broke out of a deep offensive sleep with a double to right field that plated Bautista for Toronto’s third run.\nBut the fact that the Jays had squandered many opportunities to put away the Royals with a big inning was hanging over the proceedings. After six innings, they were just 3-for-11 with runners in scoring position.\n“We’ve been in the same situation before and we have a little experience being down 0-2,” said Bautista. “It’s not the most comfortable place to be but we’re still confident. We’re a great team and we’re playing good baseball. This was just one of those days where a small mistake opened the door for the other team. We’re not going to try to over-analyze it, just come in for the next game and keep playing good ball.”\nBeen here before with my brothers. No panic at all. We good. Back home to the 6. Now, we go! @BlueJays #TORONTO\n— Marcus Stroman (@MStrooo6) October 18, 2015\nMISSED OPPORTUNITIES\nTalk all you want about how the meltdown in the seventh inning unfolded but, as much as anything, this Blue Jay loss was about missed opportunities. At least that’s the Toronto perspective.\nAs far as the Kansas City perspective is concerned, it was just another superior job by their outstanding bullpen.\nWe take you to the top of the sixth inning. Two Toronto runs were already in to make the score 3-0 and now the bases were loaded with one out and Yordano Ventura was running on fumes. That’s when Ned Yost went to Luke Hochevar.\nAnd that’s right where the bleeding stopped. Hochevar got a pop-up from the bat of Kevin Pillar then got a weak ground ball from Ryan Goins.\nIn the seventh inning, Yost went to lefthander Danny Duffy who pitched a perfect inning and then the Royals exploded to win the game. Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis each tossed a scoreless inning to seal the win.\nThat’s 3.2 innings of scoreless relief.\n“When I went to get Ventura, he was frustrated with himself,” said Yost. “I said, ‘Look, we’re going to get you off the hook here. (Hochevar) will hold them and we’re going to score some runs. We’re going to make this game really, really interesting.’\n“There are two or things that really helped us to win that game and Hochevar was one of them. They’re a hit away from breaking that game wide open at 5-0. At 3-0, you still feel you’ve got a shot.”\nOn the Toronto side, the bullpen was not as successful. Aaron Sanchez came in to get the last out of the seventh, but he gave up an RBI-double to Alex Rios. Aaron Loup gave up a sixth run in the eighth inning to shrink the comeback opportunity.\nBlue Jays vs. Royals (Game 2, ALCS)\n2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.

But it's important for us to bounce back today. You don't want every series to be (a come from behind) series, because then the odds get you usually.”\n 4564030596001 Blue Jays vs. Royals (Game 2, ALCS) About the author Ken Fidlin Follow Ken Fidlin on Twitter Other Stories Blue Jays come out flat against Royals pitching in Game 1 of ALCS\nIn a way, it was almost predictable.\n0\nBlue Jays enjoy ALDS victory while preparing for Royals\nHow do they turn the page?\n0\nSee more from Ken Fidlin »\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/@fidsunmedia", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ALCS?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/MStrooo6/status/655534178625331200", "http://embed.sendtonews.com/player", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://t.co/dt48A0mpcO", "https://twitter.com/BlueJays", "https://twitter.com/JoeyBats19/status/655559973435379713", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TORONTO?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/BlueJays/status/655531644648972288", "http://t.co/aGdrjBB8bp"], "published": "2015-10-17T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:44:28.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
