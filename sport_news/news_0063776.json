The Green girls golf team finished just two strokes short of winning the OHSAA Girls Division I State Tournament on Saturday at Ohio State University’s Gray Course in Columbus. The Bulldogs, who sat 10 strokes out of lead after the opening day, played themselves back to the top in the final round before finishing second behind Dublin Jerome, 635-637. “I can’t be any prouder for this group of girls,” Green head coach Jake Shocklee said. “This group works hard together. They are all best friends, and they are always pulling for each other to do well.” Abbie Pearce led Green with a pair of 76s, finishing with a 152 and earning second team All-Ohio. Centerville also shot 637, but was third because Green’s No. 5 golfer, Lauren Griggy, beat out Centerville’s Kayla Ramsey by six shots. The Bulldogs, who won the Federal League title this year in its first year in the league, return all but one golfer next year. “We set a lot of goals this year,” Shocklee said. “But every player set a goal to get better, so we could make that next step to play in the state tournament.” GlenOak finished seventh with a 662 and was led by freshman Jessica Hahn, who fired rounds of 71 and 80 to finish tied for fourth with a 151 and earn first-team All-Ohio honors. For both Green and GlenOak, this was their first appearance in the state golf tournament. Jackson junior Hannah Lemons tied Hahn with a 151 (75-76) to earn first-team All-Ohio honors and lead Jackson with a 684. The Polar Bears were making their eighth straight trip to the state tournament. Hahn and Lemons were joined by Dover senior Katlyn Shutt with a 151, which included the lowest round Saturday, a 2-over 73.
