Weidmann’s Orange Aftermarket division supports over 1,900 Kubota dealers with aftermarket accessories for tractors, RTVs and mowers. Hyndsight’s Journey vision system will debut at Kubota’s 2015 National Dealer Meeting to be held in Atlanta on October 12 - 16. This marketing alliance is exclusive only to Weidmann’s Kubota dealers.\nJourney is a totally portable, wire-free rear view vision system that provides a clear view and eliminates blind spots behind tractors and other utility vehicles. Journey can be easily mounted without any wiring required on any utility vehicle, allowing full rear view coverage on a sunlight readable monitor.\nJourney is also designed for a harsh environment and is rugged, weather resistant and provides a “real-to-life” visual field. It offers a real-time video stream through a direct wireless connection (camera to monitor) and a clear image that can transmit up to one-third of a mile with direct line of sight.\n“The experience, history and extensive dealer network that Weidmann has with servicing the Kubota dealer market will be a tremendous benefit to the sales of Journey in this marketplace,” notes Melissa Thompson, CEO of Hyndsight. “This marketing alliance is a major endorsement for our vision system in the utility vehicle industry. Obstructed vision and blind spots are a major problem in this industry, and Journey provides drivers with a clear field of vision, preventing safety issues, while maximizing productivity and profitability.”\nFounded in 2011, Hyndsight Vision Systems corporate offices and distribution center is located in Peterborough, NH. The company has secured world-wide distribution agreements with national and international companies and is currently developing an android version of the product and a version that will have added recording capability. The product is featured on Tractor Supply Company’s online store and Amazon.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013206.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013206.htm"], "published": "2015-10-09T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:29:05.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
