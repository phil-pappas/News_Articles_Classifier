They were expected to bounce the Bison for the 16 t h straight time in the series.\nInstead, Bucknell delivered the beatdown, a 48-10 rout that included a season-ending injury to quarterback Brandon Bialkowski.\nEven though Lehigh would regroup to beat Holy Cross and Colgate, the loss in Lewisburg had lasting repercussions.\nThe Mountain Hawks were routed by Lafayette 50-28 in a game that decided the Patriot League title and then lost their first five games in 2014 en route to a disappointing 3-8 season.\nNearly two years later, Lehigh returned to Bucknell on Saturday and left in a very different state of mind.\nJust as the 2013 defeat was a program-changer, the 21-10 victory could also prove to be a pivot point.\n\"I do remember what it felt like two years ago and this feels a lot better,\" Lehigh coach Andy Coen said as he stood on the field late Saturday afternoon. \"What was especially good to see was how many young guys we had out there and how they kept battling.\"\nThis was a win the Mountain Hawks desperately needed, and they got it.\nFor at least the next two weeks leading into the Oct. 24 game at Fordham (after a bye), the dark clouds that have loomed over South Mountain since the 2013 Lafayette loss have cleared.\n\"From a coaches' standpoint there were a lot of ugly things today … we had an interception and a fumble that put the defense in a tough spot and got sacked for a big loss… but the guys just kept picking each other up, which was great to see,\" Coen said. \"I'm very happy obviously to get this one coming off the two tough losses [to Princeton and Yale]. This should give us some momentum going into the bye.\"\nAnd make no mistake, the bye is coming at an opportune time.\nLehigh has dealt with injuries all season, particularly on the defensive side of the ball.\nThe Mountain Hawks played on Saturday without their best defensive player, junior linebacker Colton Caslow. They could get Caslow, the team's leading tackler, back in the Bronx.\nHowever, Coen said free safety Brian Githens, who was second to Caslow in tackles, suffered an injury that could keep him out the rest of the season.\nSam McCloskey played well in Githens' place against Bucknell, delivering five tackles, and Jake Buskirk, a freshman from Whitehall, did well in replacing Caslow.\nRemaining resilient and overcoming adversity have been the keys through Lehigh's first six games and figure to be a theme over the next five.\n\"The message from the coaches all week was to step up play for the guys next to you and we did that with just 10 points allowed,\" said defensive end T.J. Stubbs, who was involved in two sacks. \"A game like this is what we've been working for all spring, all summer.\"\nStubbs, like Coen, remembered what Lewisburg was like in 2013.\n\"We were really close to the seniors on that 2013 team … Nigel Muhammad, Rickie Hill, A.J. Hood … and coming back here I remembered seeing them lose on this field and it just reiterated the whole feeling of family that we've been pushing this year,\" Stubbs said. \"So I was playing today not only for the guys next to me but also for my big brothers who were on that 2013 team.\"\nQuarterback Nick Shafnisky got his first collegiate action at Bucknell in 2013 in mop-up duty. The difference was not lost on him either.\n\"Here my freshman year was my first action and we lost and then last year against Bucknell was probably my worst game,\" he said. \"So, I hadn't had good experiences against them, but today, coming out on their home turf getting this nitty, gritty win … you have to love it.\"\nLehigh fans have to love the way Shafnisky battled through his interception to compile 271 yards of offense and have a hand in three TDs against a defense that ranked among the best in the nation.\n\"There's going to be failures, hiccups, different things, \" Shafnisky said. \"To overcome that stuff is the biggest thing and that's something we haven't done lately. Right now, we're happy to have a couple of days off, but I can't wait to get back out to practice later in the week.\"\nFor the moment, Lehigh fans can't wait for the rest of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:27:12.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
