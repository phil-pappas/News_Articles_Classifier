WAYNE – Don Bosco wasn’t perfect, but made some timely plays to erase the sting from last week and earn back some momentum.\nMalik Bakker had another strong performance, scoring three touchdowns to help lead the Ironmen to a 35-0 win over Passaic Tech on Friday.\n“Passaic Tech’s got a good program,” Don Bosco coach Greg Toal said. “They play hard. They’re a good football team. We did what we had to do.”\nDon Bosco was coming off a heartbreaking loss in which it fell to Paramus Catholic on the final play of the game.\nPassaic Tech, though, had gone undefeated through its first five games. The Bulldogs have thrived with a stout defense that had allowed just 17 points entering Friday.\nAfter Friday’s win, Toal lauded the way the Bulldogs played against his team.\n“They’ve got nothing to hang their head about,” Toal said. “I’ve got a lot of respect for them.”\nThe Ironmen jumped out to an early lead, thanks to a 67-yard kick return from Tommy Courtney. Running back Bakker then had runs of 10 and 4 yards, then scored on a 4-yard run. Ethan Cordero’s extra point gave the Ironmen a quick 7-0 lead.\nDon Bosco then caught a break. On its second offensive play, Passaic Tech fumbled and the Ironmen recovered at the Bulldogs’ 21-yard line. That set up a 3-yard scoring run for Bakker, and Cordero’s extra point made it 14-0.\nThe Ironmen continued to build their lead in the second quarter. They marched down the field from Passaic Tech’s 27-yard line to set up Mark McGuire’s 13-yard touchdown pass to Christian Curcio.\nThe Bulldogs made a great play later in the quarter to give themselves a great opportunity. On a first-and-10 from Passaic Tech’s 36, quarterback Derrick Cuavers threw a 56-yard pass to Yasir Thomas to get the ball down to the Ironmen’s 8-yard line.\nBut Passaic Tech couldn’t get the ball into the end zone, and on a fourth-and-goal from the 8, Don Bosco’s Tyrone Hill made an interception to end the first half.\nThe Ironmen added two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter.\nThey started a drive at Passaic Tech’s 35-yard line, and Bakker covered 18 yards on the drive to help get the ball to the 3. Then he punched it in from there. Cordero’s extra point made it 28-0.\nOn the Ironmen’s final drive, McGuire made a nice 15-yard pass to Courtney, and the quarterback later scored on a 1-yard run that put Don Bosco up, 35-0.\n“This was good for us,” Toal said. “We needed to get back on a winning track. We’ve got to get on a run from here.”\nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:40.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
