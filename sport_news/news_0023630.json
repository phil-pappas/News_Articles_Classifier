Nickyia Lovely scored two goals and Hailee Lovely had a goal and two assists for Gardiner. Maddy Beaulieau added a goal for the hosts, who scored twice in each half. \nNickyia Lovely's first goal was the 62nd of her high school career and marked a new school record for career goals scored at Gardiner. The record was previously held by Hailey Chadbourne, who accomplished the feat in 2008. \nThe game was briefly halted for a ceremony honoring the hard-working senior, who added a second goal in the second half. \nFor Camden Hills, Emily Daggett scored with 10:52 left in the first half to make it 2-1. \nHailee Lovely scored at 27:08 and Nickyia Lovely at 14;11, off an assist from Hailee Lovely, to give the Tigers a 2-1 first-half cushion. \nIn the second half Beaulieau scored with 24:22 remaining, off an assist from Skye LaVoie, and Nickyia Lovely added the final goal, with 20:57 left, on assist from Hailee Lovely. \nGardiner finished with eight shots on goal and 10 penalty corners. Camden Hills had one shot on goal, and the Windjammers scored on it, and five penalty corners. \nJenna Stearns played in the cage for Camden Hills and made four saves, while Kaylin Mansir was goal for Gardiner. \nCamden Hills coach Lindsey Clement said the field's surface made things difficult as \"we were on a grass field with uneven ground and full of divots.\" \n\"We knew today would be a tough game and we would need to play a full 60 minutes of intensity, and we did just that,\" she said. \"Our girls have really clean stick skills, and that allows them to perform well on many surfaces. The field conditions today did not provide us with a good surface for dribbling or dodging. We've worked hard all season to perfect clean skills and positioning, but today we needed to adapt. Clean skills on a bumpy field would not work for us. The only way to advance the ball down the field were big hits, and Gardiner did just that. Their hits were hard and their forwards were cutting. They have a very talented forward line and our defense did a great job. We struggled some with marking, and two of their goals were results from us not marking tight enough.\" \nDespite the loss Clement credited the hard-nosed play of her team, including Frances Pendleton and Caroline Keefe, who made \"numerous stick saves\" on defense, while Hilary Merrifield and Emily Bowen were held in check by the Tigers. \nWillow Grinnell and Emily Daggett also had strong outings in the midfield. \nBut the star on the Windjammer side, according to the coach, was Molly Davee, who \"was the rock of our team today\" and has made great defensive decisions all year, often marking the opposition's top offensive players. \n\"She had two tough jobs and was often forced to decide between the two of which was the bigger threat: mark [Nickyia] Lovely or pressure the ball that was being fed to [Nickyia] Lovely,\" said Clement. \"Most teams double-team Lovely, so Molly marking by herself in the middle of the field was a tough enough job as is. Then to add in another layer of decision making is even more challenging. Molly was up for the challenge and she did a great job at shutting down Lovely in the midfield.\" Courier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:08:28.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
