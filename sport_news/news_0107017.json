The Dragons downed host Floyd Central, 1-0. \n\"From where we were when I took over five years ago to where we are today, it's amazing,\" said Silver Creek coach Pat Anderson after the match. \"These girls deserve all of the credit and not just from this year, but all of my players from the last five years. These seniors have seen a grand transformation. It's kind of surreal right now.\" \nScarbrough managed the first real opportunity for either team when a free kick was awarded. The senior hit a hard shot that rattled off of the crossbar and went harmlessly behind the goal. \nTen minutes later, she found the ball at her head, this time putting it in the back of the net. \n\"There are no words to describe what is going on right now,\" said Scarbrough after the victory. \"I couldn't have chosen a better time to score a goal like that than in my senior year. We're a team who is ready to fight and play as one team.\" \nThe Dragons (16-2-1) held the majority of possession in the first half. They created opportunities, some of which hit the goalpost, but only finding the one goal before the halftime break. \nScarbrough found the ball at her feet many times with an opportunity to score, with one finding the back the net. But it was waved off because of an offsides call. Another shot was blocked almost as soon as it came off of her foot. \nThe Highlanders (7-8-5) began finding more possession, but opportunities were few and far between because of the physical defense of Silver Creek. Samanta Garcia nearly had a one-on-one with Dragons goalkeeper Kylee Sumner, but the play was cleared by a defender. \n\"I wanted this really bad, not only for myself but for the team. We've worked really hard,\" said Sumner. \nFloyd Central’s Emma Pappas took a long shot with under five minutes left in regulation that beat Sumner, but sailed high over the bar. \nOnly moments later, in the Highlanders’ attempt to find an equalizer, Floyd Central’s Zoe Fifer got around her defender and sent a cross into teammate Sydney Sneed. But the freshman was unable to corral the pass for a shot. \n\"I like our resiliency,\" continued Anderson. \"I think Floyd turned it up in the second half, and we didn't have those good possessions that they did, but we held strong. I told the girls that it would come down to our midfield and I really feel like our midfield played well.\" \nSilver Creek will vie for its first regional title next week in the Class 2A East Central Regional. The Dragons will face the host Trojans (18-1), who were ranked 15th in the final Indiana Soccer Coaches Association Class 2A girls’ poll, in the second semifinal at about 7 p.m. Wednesday. \n\"We haven't played our best game yet,\" admitted an emotional Anderson. \"I don't know when we will, but we haven't seen our best yet. It sure feels good, though.” \n\"Going into regionals, we will still be pumped after this,\" concluded Sumner. \"We'll have the confidence that we can do it from this game, and I believe that we can.” \nCLASS 2A FLOYD CENTRAL SECTIONAL \nCHAMPIONSHIP \nSILVER CREEK 1, FLOYD CENTRAL 0 \nSilver Creek 1 0—1 \nFloyd Central 0 0—0 \nSCORING PLAYS \nSC — Olivia Scarbrough (Jordan Leddon assist), 16th minute. \nsports@newsandtribune.com With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:17:33.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
