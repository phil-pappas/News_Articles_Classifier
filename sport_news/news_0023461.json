Even if it took U.Va. getting some help late in regulation in the form of a critical penalty against Syracuse, and avoiding disaster in overtime, the Cavaliers aren't picky at this point about how the wins come. \n\"It's huge,\" U.Va. quarterback Matt Johns said. \"A game like Notre Dame, it's tough. We lost in the last second. Last week at Pitt, we had a chance to pull it out. Things didn't go our way. This week, it finally went our way. We fought and fought and fought. That's the story of this team. I know our record is 2-4, but I think there's a lot of fight in this team.\" \nJordan Ellis capped the game with a 3-yard touchdown run in the third overtime, but long before his score, U.Va. (2-4, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) got some help from a critical face-mask penalty on the final drive in regulation just to preserve the Cavaliers' chances of sending it to overtime.

It proceeded to put together its second-longest scoring drive in school history by plays when it went 88 yards in 19 plays to set up a game-tying 25-yard field goal by Ian Frye as time expired. \nU.Va. looked to be in trouble on third-and-15 from its own 9 when Johns connected on a pass to running back Albert Reid for just a 6-yard gain, but defensive end Ron Thompson bailed out the Cavaliers by getting called for a face-mask penalty while trying to tackle Reid. U.Va. earned a first down by penalty and 15 yards on the play, moving from the 9 to the 30. \nThe 2015 Virginia football season in pictures. \n\"I remember looking up and saying, 'Thank you, big guy. I appreciate that,'\" London said. \"Sometimes things more like that happen. Some things that sustain drives, keeps them going. Sometimes you're on the other end of that. It was one of those plays that kind of provided kind of impetus for the guys to say, 'Let's go. We can have opportunities here.'\" \nAfter the penalty, U.Va. got up the field behind the passing of Johns, who completed 9 of 14 passes for 77 yards on the possession. On fourth-and-3 from U.Va.'s 47, he completed a pass to running back Taquan Mizzell, who gained 11 yards to keep the Cavaliers' hopes alive. \nJohns finished the game 24-of-37 passing for 234 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Mizzell had one of his best all-around games, catching 10 passes for 69 yards and running 13 times for 58 yards and two touchdowns. \nU.Va. ended up with a 393-334 yardage advantage, but the category was obviously skewed by overtime possessions that started at the opponents' 25 — when they weren't affected by penalties. At the end of regulation, both teams had 303 yards. \nIn the overtime periods, U.Va. had to overcome two potentially crushing penalties of its own. \nOn the opening possession in overtime, freshman quarterback Eric Dungey found running back Ervin Phillips on a 7-yard touchdown pass to put Syracuse (3-3, 1-1) up 31-24. \nDungey, who caused problems for U.Va.'s defense all day while completing 16 of 22 passes for 150 yards and two touchdowns and running 18 times for 85 yards and a touchdown, was hit by linebacker Zach Bradshaw a moment after releasing the touchdown pass. Bradshaw was penalized for a targeting penalty and ejected. \nInstead of starting its first overtime possession at the 25, U.Va. opened at the 40. Johns produced the longest passing play of the game on third-and-6 when he rolled to his right and hit wide receiver Canaan Severin for a 36-yard touchdown to tie the game at 31 as Severin fell into the end zone behind the defense. \nMizzell put U.Va. back on top 38-31 with a 13-yard touchdown run in the second overtime, but his run was accompanied by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on right tackle Eric Smith, who took his helmet off on the field. Starting Syracuse's next drive at the 12, Dungey immediately passed to receiver Steve Ishmael for a 12-yard touchdown to tie the game again. \nU.Va.'s defense stepped up in the third overtime. Syracuse got the ball first in the overtime, but soon faced third-and-10 from U.Va.'s 25. Defensive tackle David Dean and middle linebacker Micah Kiser combined to sack Dungey for a 6-yard loss, setting up a 48-yard field attempt that Cole Murphy missed wide right. \nFive running plays later, U.Va. was celebrating a win in the end zone. \nU.Va. had to rally from a 10-point deficit early in the fourth quarter. Trailing 24-14, U.Va. went on a 15-play, 75-yard drive that Johns finished with a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Charlie Hopkins with 10:31 remaining to cut Syracuse's lead to 24-21. \nSyracuse built its comfortable early lead with some second-quarter assistance in the form of two costly turnovers by Virginia. Syracuse scored 14 points off the turnovers. \nWith 32 seconds left in the second quarter, Johns had a third-and-10 pass tipped near the line of scrimmage at U.Va.'s 29-yard line. Defensive end Qaadir Sheppard intercepted the pass, setting Syracuse up at U.Va.'s 26. \nDungey took care of the rest in dazzling fashion. \nOn Syracuse's next play, Dungey dropped back, saw the middle of the field open up and decided to run for daylight. He got to U.Va.'s 5 before hurdling free safety Quin Blanding and scoring a touchdown to put Syracuse ahead 21-14 with 24 seconds left before halftime. \nJust before Johns' interception, Syracuse got a little bold on its previous possession. Facing fourth-and-4 from Syracuse's 43, Riley Dixon faked a punt and ran 15 yards for a first down. \nSyracuse made the most of it, finishing the drive five plays and a pass interference penalty on cornerback Maurice Canady later with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Jordan Fredericks. His touchdown with 1:02 left in the second quarter tied the score at 14. \nFumble returns for touchdowns benefited both teams in the second quarter. With the game tied 7-7, U.Va. linebacker Mike Moore got to Dungey on third-and-6 from Syracuse's 29, forcing a fumble that was scooped up by strong safety Wilfred Wahee and returned 32 yards for a touchdown with 3:49 left in the quarter to give the Cavaliers a 14-7 lead. \nSyracuse opened the scoring with 10:20 remaining in the second quarter when strong safety Antwan Cordy recovered a Mizzell fumble, which was the result of a hit by defensive end Donnie Simmons. Cordy returned it up the sideline for a 44-yard touchdown to put Syracuse ahead 7-0. \nAfter the game, London said he couldn't repeat the words Mizzell used on the sideline to describe his mood when he fumbled the ball away. Mizzell summed it up. \n\"I was very, very upset,\" Mizzell said. \n\"I told (the coaches) afterwards that I was ready to roll and that I was back into the game mentally. I knew I had to make it up for the team and make plays when I had the chance.\" \nU.Va. grabbed momentum for a short while at the end of the first quarter on the strength of a goal-line stand. \nSyracuse was stopped on two plays from the Cavaliers' 1-yard line, forcing a turnover on downs as the clock expired. Kiser and Blanding combined to stuff Fredericks at the line of scrimmage for no gain on third down, before Canady got to Dungey on fourth down for a 4-yard loss. \n\"It really brings us a lot of momentum moving forward, knowing that we can go and win the rest of our games,\" said Moore of the win. \"Right now, we're just getting ready to beat North Carolina (next Saturday).\" \nWood can be reached by phone at 757-247-4642.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:01:45.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
