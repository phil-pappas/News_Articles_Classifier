The Aztecs have started league play with four straight wins for the first time since 1998. \nSan Diego State opened the scoring on Maxwell Smith's 18-yard touchdown pass to Mikah Holder. Two plays later, Alex Barrett forced a fumble by Kent Myers and Smith finished a short drive with a 1-yard sneak. \nMyers had 93 yards passing with one touchdown and one interception for Utah State (4-3, 3-1). The Aggies turned it over four times. Memphis 66, Tulsa 42: Paxton Lynch completed 32 of 44 passes for a career-high 447 yards and four touchdowns to help the No. 18 Tigers win their 14th straight game, beating the host Golden Hurricane. Lynch has thrown for more than 300 yards in each of his last six games for Memphis (7-0, 3-0 American Athletic Conference). \nThe Tigers have gone more than a year since their last loss, against Houston. The winning streak is the third longest in the country behind No. 1 Ohio State (20 games) and No. 4 TCU (15 games). Advertisement \nDane Evans was 24-of-36 passing for 421 yards and four touchdowns for the Golden Hurricane (3-4, 0-3). Keyarris Garrett had 14 catches for a career-high 268 yards and three touchdowns. \nBoth in the top 10 nationally in total offense, the teams combined for 1,248 yards of offense in the wild back-and-forth affair. Utah-USC: Utah is the unbeaten No. 3 team in the nation, riding an eight-game winning streak and a world of confidence. The Utes are on the road this week against a .500 opponent with an interim head coach and three losses in its last four games. And Utah is still an underdog to USC in the oddsmakers' eyes. \nEven during a season of utter upheaval for USC, the Trojans' storehouse of top talent still gets everyone's respect, including that of the cautious Utes (6-0, 3-0 Pac-12). \n\"I don't think that anyone would argue (against the fact) that year in, year out, they're the most talented team in the Pac-12,\" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. \"We've got to be at our absolute best this week to have a chance. ... The Coliseum is a great venue. It's one of the most storied stadiums in the country, but I think it boils down to the talent level they have.\" \nYet the Utes clearly are doing more to turn their comparatively modest talent into winning football, while the Trojans (3-3, 1-2) are desperate for a confidence-boosting win. \nEven if the oddsmakers favor USC, the Trojans hold the Utes in the respect they deserve. \n\"Utah has been a tough team for the last couple of years, taking us to the fourth quarter every year,\" USC linebacker Su'a Cravens said. \"It's not surprising they're ranked where they are, but it's our job to knock them off.\" Ohio State-Rutgers: No. 1 Ohio State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) turns to J.T. Barrett to lead its offense against Rutgers on Saturday after seven games of ups and downs with Cardale Jones as the starter. The Scarlet Knights have had no such issues with their quarterback. Chris Laviano has seized the job for Rutgers after a preseason competition that did not get nearly the attention as the one making headlines in Columbus, Ohio. \nLaviano is second in the Big Ten in passer rating (156.14), leads in completion percentage (69.3) and is coming off a career game. The sophomore threw for 386 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Scarlet Knights (3-3, 1-2) from 25 points down to beat Indiana 55-52 last week. \nIf only Urban Meyer had it so easy with his quarterbacks. Jones has started since Week 1 against Virginia Tech, but his play has been inconsistent at best, especially in the red zone, so this week Barrett was promoted by Meyer. \nLast year's Big Ten player of the year has accounted for seven touchdowns (five running and two passing) the last two games in relief of Jones. \n\"He's a true field general,\" tight end Nick Vannett said of Barrett. \"He grabs the attention of everybody, and everybody listens to what he says. When you have a quarterback like that, it definitely gives you confidence in the offense.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:23:28.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
