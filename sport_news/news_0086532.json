Headaches that turned out not to be migraines or the flu and became increasingly more debilitating. They were headaches that brought vomiting and eventually brought the worst kind of heartache for his parents. \nA CAT scan showed a tumor the size of a golf ball. (DAVID MORAN) \nThe entire tumor was successfully removed at Barbara Bush Children's Hospital in Portland, Maine. \n\"But because of its pathology, it also is a tumor that is likely to grow back,\" Nick's mom Nicole said Thursday night from Memphis. \nNicole Brierely is originally from Andover. Her husband Justus is from Marlborough. They raised their family, Nick, Joey, 7, and Julia, 5, in Glastonbury before moving to Marlborough for a year and on to Kennebunk, Maine in 2014. Early this year, they were looking at a beautiful boy who loved to ride his bike. And now they were looking at a beautiful boy with something ugly called anaplastic medulloblastoma with a Myc amplification. \nThere is a standard protocol for treatment, except for one clinical trial that specifically targets Nick's condition. It's at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, and the Brierleys received an invitation from St. Jude. They didn't need to be asked twice. They left for Tennessee on May 4. \nThere were seven weeks at St. Jude that included 30 days of radiation. Nicholas was being sedated daily. The regimen was grueling. Anxiety was high. There was a six-week return home to allow Nick's body to heal. They are back in Memphis for eight months that includes seven rounds of chemo. \nNicholas had dropped from 61 to 48 pounds, but a feeding tube has helped put back some weight. He goes into the hospital for a week once a month for chemo. The rest of the time he returns as an outpatient for lab work, physical therapy, clinic visits, even school there as a fifth grader one hour three days a week. \n\"He's old enough to know what cancer is,\" Nicole said. \"Sometimes there is nothing you can say that can comfort him.\" \nThe boy, you should know, is a fighter. \nSt. Jude pays for his treatment and the travel of one adult. Target House at St. Jude is great, Nicole said. There are activities. There are some dinners supplied by volunteers. St. Jude pays for housing for families of four or fewer. With grandparents, they have seven. \nJustus gave up his job in April. Nicole, who has been a stay-at-home mom, was preparing to return to work this fall. That can't happen now. In Memphis, there is rent for an apartment, Internet expense to home school Joey and Julia, airfare, all sorts of living expenses. Back home, there are taxes and a mortgage. Nick is scheduled to return to St. Jude every three months for three years and once a year until he is 18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:26:49.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
