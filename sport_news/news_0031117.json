The goal was given despite the home side's protests. \nCologne forward Anthony Modest forced goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler into action midway through the second half. Milos Jojic was next to test him from a free kick, and the Hannover goalkeeper went on to make another good save from Modeste to safeguard all three points. \nBottom side Stuttgart was hosting promoted Ingolstadt later. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:26:08.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
