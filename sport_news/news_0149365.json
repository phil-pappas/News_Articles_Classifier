With Detroit on the verge of capping a 91-yard drive with the go-ahead touchdown with less than 2 minutes remaining, Chancellor came from the side and punched the ball from Johnson's arm as he was being tackled by Earl Thomas. The ball bounded into the end zone and went over the back line for a touchback and Seattle's ball at the 20. Russell Wilson was sacked six times and pulled numerous escape acts, but threw a TD pass to Doug Baldwin in the first half and Steven Hauschka hit a pair of field goals from 50-plus yards as Seattle evened its record at 2-2.
