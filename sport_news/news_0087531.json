(AP) - The Steelers and Chiefs have both dealt with a crippling number of injuries this season, whether it was Pittsburgh losing quarterbacks Ben Roethlisberger and Michael Vick or Kansas City losing Jamaal Charles for the season. \nThe big difference? Pittsburgh has pressed on. Kansas City has shriveled up. \nThe Steelers head to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday in search of their third straight win, and their fifth victory in sixth games. Third-string quarterback Landry Jones is expected to get his first start, and a plethora of other backups are also expected to play significant minutes. \nMeanwhile, the Chiefs are trying to end a maddening five-game skid lowlighted by last-minute losses to Denver and Chicago, and a horrid offensive performance last week in Minnesota. \n“We are extremely fragile. We acknowledge that,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. “We aren’t looking for comfort. We aren’t looking to make excuses. Just in the state of where we are, we are going … to make necessary adjustments to put ourselves in position to win.” \nThe Steelers (4-2) have so far been able to do just that. \nRoethlisberger has been practicing but is still unlikely to play as he recovers from a knee injury, and Vick is sidelined by a hamstring injury. But in their place a week ago, Jones threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns in leading Pittsburgh to a 25-13 win over Arizona. \nIt was precisely the kind of gritty performance that has become a Steelers hallmark. \n“That was really exciting. Not only for us but for Landry,” Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown said. “He showed amazing growth, amazing poise.” \nEspecially considering everybody he was missing. Offensive tackle Kelvin Beachum is out for the season with a knee injury, center Maurkice Pouncey has a broken leg, wide receiver Martavis Bryant has been dealing with a knee injury, offensive tackle Mike Adams an ailing back. \nEven more guys are missing on the defensive side. \n“We focus not on the guys that aren’t playing, but the guys that are,” Tomlin said. “We won’t spend a bunch of time lamenting about the loss of Kelvin Beachum or whether or not Ben or Mike are available. We are going to spend our time talking about putting (offensive tackle) Alejandro Villanueva in a position to perform, or how to accentuate the talents of Landry.” \nThe Chiefs (1-5) are trying to do the same thing. So far, they’ve had less success. \nCharles had surgery Tuesday to repair the ACL in his right knee, leaving the Chiefs without their biggest playmaker for the rest of the season. Without him they were nearly shut out in Minnesota a week ago - they had 51 yards of first-half offense. \n“It’s tough, obviously, because of the type of player he is,” Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith said. “He’s a guy the defense is always worried about, run and pass. He’s tough and he’s tough to replace. We have to make some changes, guys have got to step up and we got to go.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:58:33.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
