The iconic structure, built cheaply but seedbed of fame to the late architect Michael Graves, will not only see another day but several decades of brightly colored postmodern branding for a city still doing its makeup in the mirror.\nPortland taxpayers and utility ratepayers will cough up nearly a quarter of a million dollars a week over 20 years to pay for it. That, an analysis by a panel of building experts working at the city's behest shows, is the best deal available, as it would cost yet more to find new property close to downtown and start all over. Commissioner Nick Fish was succinct in an interview with the editorial board of The Oregonian/OregonLive: \"I said, 'Let's stop futzing around with this.' ... We can't kick the can down the road anymore.\"\nRegrettably, he's right. Costs will only soar as the building continues to import water and an estimated 1,300 city workers withstand heightened risk in the event of earthquake.\nReasonable people could argue over assumptions guiding the panel of construction experts — mainly, that the city's administrative center should be situated downtown, near other government buildings — but a weary Council, having outsourced its thinking, stopped the money meter on a workable solution. It will never know, meanwhile, whether the right imaginative approach was sufficiently considered to house city workers — among them that public servants could be distributed in smaller leased locations around town or in some cases work from home — because it never really conducted adequate brainstorming on the matter.\nIn any event, the plan requires strict oversight — and here outsourcing will help. The Council should immediately establish a monitoring panel that ensures all bids and construction costs stay within the $195 million limit and that the more than $6 million to be spent soon on design and associated project costs not go a penny beyond. A narrowly tasked monitoring panel would hold check down the line against excessive construction change orders and the kinds of wish-list fulfilments that pushed costs scandalously out of control at the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant.\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:21:33.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
