Unfortunately, the Cardinals came up just short. Second-seeded Pocono East fell 3-2 to No. 5 Parkland in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference boys soccer championship game in Nazareth on Thursday night. The clock stopped with 2:22 remaining for two players down with cramps. On Parkland's ensuing free kick, Conley Hochstetler found Peter Kwakye-Ackah, who headed the ball into the net with 2:18 remaining to give the Trojans the 2015 EPC boys soccer title. \"I tell the boys if you want to win the big games, you've got to put yourself out there,\" PM East head coach Bob Black said. \"You've got to be willing to take the highs and the lows, and of course this is one of those lows. I think the team put everything they had on the field, and I'm really proud of them.\" The Cardinals came out charging. Doug Goitia sank his 30th goal of the season just four minutes into the game with an assist from junior Zach Gothard. Then, just three minutes later, Goitia found Ian Lake over the middle for a shot found the back of the net and would have been a goal, but the whistle blew just before the shot could be taken, negating the would-be goal. Parkland capitalized just moments later as senior Byron Derti sank a shot of his own to equalize at the score at one goal apiece with 29:40 left to play in the half. The game remained in the Trojans' control for the remainder of the half, applying all the pressure they needed. \"They did put a lot of pressure on us and the thing is we responded to that pressure,\" Black said. \"We fought through it and I'm really proud of them.\" Pocono Mountain East faced Parkland just once this season but was shut out in a 2-0 loss - one of only two losses the Cardinals faced all year. Parkland knew they were getting a handful meeting Pocono East back in the EPC finals. \"The game plan was to stay together as a team,\" Parkland head coach Patrick Birns said. \"They're tough. I mean they have three great players. A great team, but three great players you really gotta watch. And 45 (Goitia) did us in the first five minutes, so I was so happy with how they (the Trojans) responded.\" EPC Championship No. 5 Parkland 3, No. 2 PM East 2 Parkland 1-2 - 3 PM East 1-1 - 2 Goals - P, Byron Derti, Benjamin Jago, Peter Kwake-Ackah; PME, Doug Goita, Ian Lake.
