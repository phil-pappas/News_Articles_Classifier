We feel we can stop any offense at any time.”\nCentral (6-1) appeared close to putting Halls (3-4) away early, but the Red Devils wouldn’t go down easy.\nMatthew Runge-Gold was a big reason. The junior defensive back and wide receiver scored all of the Red Devils’ points, returning an interception 39 yards and a kickoff 99 yards. Halls had won three in a row, scoring 110 points in the victories, before Friday’s loss and offensive shutout.\nThe Bobcats’ offense put on a show. Running backs Jeremiah Howard (199 yards on 11 carries) and Jadarius Sackie (133 on 10) ran freely.\nSlade’s defense registered its third shutout of the season.\nWith Central leading 7-0, Halls was threatening to tie the game when Norris stepped in front of a slow developing screen pass at his own 34 and rumbled 42 yards to the Halls 34. Two plays later, Sackie ran 34 yards around left end. Central led 14-0 nine seconds into the second.\nPeebles intercepted an Andrew Davis pass 1:13 later and returned it 34 yards for a 21-0 lead.\nThe Red Devils drove to the Bobcats’ 13, but on fourth-and-13 from the 16, Peebles streaked from the left corner to sack Davis and end the threat.\n“We’re excited every time our kids step on the field, especially our defense,” Central coach Bryson Rosser said. “Especially our defense. They give us a chance in every game.”\nVictor Lee is a freelance contributor.\nCentral 48, Halls 14\nHalls 0 14 0 0 — 14\nCentral 7 21 7 13 — 48\nScoring: C — Jadarius Sackie 9 run (Eli Holbert kick); Sackie 34 run (Holbert kick); Rondrow Peebles 34 interception return (Holbert kick); Riley Gaul 9 run (Holbert kick); H — Briggs Marcentel 99 kick return (Matthew Rontetold kick); Marcentel 26 interception return (Rontetold kick); C — Sackie 16 run (Holbert kick); Jeremiah Howard 5 run (Holbert kick); Craig Burt 6 run (kick failed)\nRecords: Halls 4-3, Central 6-1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:34:06.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
