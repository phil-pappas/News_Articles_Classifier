Wright batted the ball out of the end zone, which should've given the Lions the ball at the 1-yard line with 1:45 remaining. Instead, the referees didn't call a foul, and the Seahawks took over and ran out the clock.\nCaldwell has said multiple times this week that he wants the players to focus on preparing for Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals. Safety Glover Quin said anything related to changing the officiating errors falls on the team's executives.\n\"From the organization's standpoint, front office (and) owners, that's stuff for them to deal with,\" he said. \"As players, we can't change it. all we can do is go out and play, and at the end of the day, we're still 0-4.\"\nLions president Tom Lewand, who was with Ford at the league meetings, has not responded to multiple requests for comment related to the blown call Monday.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:14:28.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
