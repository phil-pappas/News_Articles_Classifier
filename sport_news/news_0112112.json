Bows fine tuned. And trail cameras prepped. \nIf everything works out, then a well prepared hunter should have many opportunities throughout the season to fill his or her tags. \nTo be one of the successful bowhunters means you also need to have an understanding of early season patterns and what October hunting is not. \nDeer hunters love to think of giant bucks with one thing on their mind -–finding that doe. \nThis singular mindset leads that wall hanger to do things he never normally would and possibly travel right by your stand. October is not the time for that. \nOctober deer are some of my favorite to pursue because they are much more predicable. \nYes, I like to see numerous bucks crashing through the woods at all hours of the day as much as the next hunter, but the rut can be unpredictable. That is what makes it so alluring. But on any given day, I much rather have deer that are easy to pattern. \nEarly season whitetails are in a strong feeding and bedding pattern. As long as food sources are present, and right now there are lots of fields yet to be harvested, the deer will be nearby. \nIn fact, if a localized herd is left undisturbed it will stay as close to its source as possible. \nAsk any farmer and they surely will tell you about giant bucks they kicked up while combining. \nEven a field of soybeans can provide enough cover for bedding deer. \nOnce the combines start rolling, these groups of whitetails will make their way to the closet timber stand. This is where the successful October deer hunter understands his property and how the deer use it. \nYour entrance and exit routes to these timber stands are always important, but I feel the early season is some of the most critical times to plan your path carefully. \nThe deer trail this time of year often is not very long. Like I said earlier, as long as the deer feel secure, they will stay close to the food. \nSuccessful bowhunters position themselves on these travel corridors. That is why your path in and out of the woods needs to be well hidden, worked with the wind and kept with the terrain of the land. \nIf these factors are used properly, you can sneak right into a pretty small space and setup. \nAs the season moves along and food sources become more scarce, the travel corridors lengthen, making entering and exiting the woods easier. \nThe next critical factor, I believe, to successful October hunting is being patient. The woods are still very green and full of brush. An arrow needs a perfect path to fly though so a clean shot is made. \nThat first nice deer of the season gets our heart pumping and our desire to let an arrow fly might supercede the patience it takes to wait for a clear opportunity. \nMost of us have made this mistake sometime in our bowhunting careers. The end result is almost always a spooked deer and us mentally kicking ourselves for not waiting a little longer. \nWatching that buck take just one more step to clear a small sapling seems to take forever. \nIf you already are drawn back with your bow, the waiting becomes that much harder. \nThe wait is worth it though. Early season hunting is a massive exercise in patience. \nAs the leaves slowly turn, and early October marches onward, I hope you find some time to slip into your favorite deer stand. \nEnjoy the time outdoors, be patient, and find those food sources. \nYou’ll be glad you did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:00:46.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
