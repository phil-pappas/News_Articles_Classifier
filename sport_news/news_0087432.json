A win in Manhattan may not be the sexiest looking win on its schedule this year, but a win on the road against the Wildcats will more than likely be a solid mark on the Sooners' resume if the team is able to pull it off. Kansas State has played Oklahoma State and TCU - two ranked teams - extremely close this year.\nFor Kansas State, a win over Oklahoma would break them out of the recent funk they've been in. As mentioned before, their previous two games against ranked teams have been extremely close. And one of those close losses was with a wide receiver playing quarterback . The Wildcats are also going for its third win against Oklahoma in the last four years.\nWhen Oklahoma has the ball\nThe same question keeps popping up for Oklahoma each week. Will they run the ball more? Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon are too good to be getting five carries a game. Over the last few weeks, head coach Bob Stoops has fielded questions about the run game and the response is always the same. He hopes the running game gets going so the offense can improve. At some point, it's going to be put up or shut up time for offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley.\nTCU was able to run all over the Wildcats. Trevone Boykin and Aaron Green each had 11 carries and more than 120 yards rushing. Running the ball will take some pressure off Baker Mayfield as well.\nWhen Kansas State has the ball\nThis whole game is going to hinge on both team's rushing attacks. The Texas Longhorns absolutely shredded the Sooners defense a week ago. Kansas State is a run-first team, and that's good news against Oklahoma. Expect Joe Hubener, Justin Silmon and Charles Jones to get their yards, especially if Oklahoma's defense rushes the edges like it did against Texas. The Wildcats' run-pass option should keep the Sooners' defense on its toes. And if Oklahoma tackles like it did against the Longhorns, the running game should be able to break off a few big runs.\nPrediction\nSince the 2005 season, the Sooners have lost back-to-back games one time. That means in 133 total games Oklahoma has lost two in a row once. That happened last year when Oklahoma State topped the Sooners in Norman and when Clemson throttled them 40-6 in the Russell Athletic Bowl. They've also lost two of their last three to Kansas State. Oklahoma also had major problems a week ago protecting Mayfield and stopping the run. Kansas State has shown that it can compete with some of the conference's best teams. Again, this game will hinge on both teams' ability to run the ball.\nScore: Kansas State 34, Oklahoma 30\nTwitter: @Josh_Friemel\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:58:30.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
