CBS Sports’ Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that former Mariners draft pick and Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek has interviewed for the job. Varitek, 43, was a first-round draft pick by the Mariners in 1994. The catcher was traded in 1997 with pitcher Derek Lowe to the Red Sox for reliever Heathcliff Slocumb. Varitek was a three-time All-Star and helped lead the Red Sox to two World Series titles. He has been a special assistant to the general manager for the Red Sox since 2012 and has never been a manager. Heyman reported that Varitek might not be strongly interested in the job because he would have to leave the Boston area. On Monday, Ken Davidoff of the New York Post reported that Rays third-base coach Charlie Montoyo had interviewed for the job.
