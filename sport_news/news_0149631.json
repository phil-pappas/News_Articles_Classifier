John Wiitala was camped out in front of the Miami net and took a pass from below the red line, put a shot on but it was turned away by Ryan McKay. Miami countered with a similar opportunity a couple minutes later when freshman Zach LaValle muscled an OSU defender off of the puck and delivered a net front pass to Kevin Morris, who had his shot blocked up and out of play. \nA recipient of a pass this time, LaValle had another close call his very next shift when he took a slapshot from the top of the circle that just whistled past goaltender Matt Tomkins' far side. \nA good offensive zone possession lifted Miami to the game's first score at the 9:56 mark of the first period. Ryan Siroky worked the puck from the corner back to Chris Joyaux at the point, who found Andrew Schmit on a cross-ice seam pass to the bottom of the circle. From there, Schmit picked his target and beat Tomkins high to the glove side. \nMiami took the contest's first penalty 12:09 into the opening frame. The RedHawks killed the penalty with relative ease. In fact, Miami received the best chance of the Buckeye power play as Taylor Richart and Sean Kuraly found themselves in a 2-on-1 opportunity. Kuraly got a shot off but it was saved by Tomkins. \nMiami nearly gave themselves a two goal lead with five and a half remaining in the first when Grant Hutton crashed the net and took a feed from Anthony Louis, but the shot was turned aside by Tomkins and the net came off of its moorings in the process. \nThe first period came to a close with Miami leading the way in shots, collecting ten to OSU's seven. More importantly, the `Hawks held a 1-0 advantage on the scoreboard. \nThe second period opened with both teams playing a little back-and-forth hockey. OSU nearly tied things up just over five minutes into the second stanza when Josh Healey wristed a shot from the point. The puck was deflected but McKay made the save through heavy traffic to maintain the lead. \nOSU took its first penalty six minutes into the period, a tripping call on Luke Stork. The Miami power play ended up being fruitful for one team, but it was not the RedHawks. The Buckeyes capitalized on a miscue in the Miami defensive zone and Anthony Greco collected the shorthanded tally. \nA Miami penalty at 8:51 of the second period put Ohio State back on the power play. The Buckeyes put a few shots on net, but nothing major and the RedHawks successfully posted their second kill of the night. Siroky redeemed himself his very next shift. The freshman took a pass from the Miami defensive zone and rushed up ice and got a step on a Buckeye blue liner. He was unable to get a shot on net as a result of a slashing call on Tommy Parran. However, the RedHawks' second man advantage was to no avail despite several quality looks. \nWith the RedHawks pressing in the closing minutes, OSU took its timeout with 1:39 left to play in the second period. With just six second left in the period, Miami was whistled for an interference penalty that gave Ohio State its third power play of the night. \nThe second period came to a close with the score knotted at one apiece, with Miami holding a 23-18 lead in shots on goal. \nThe third period began with Miami having the task of killing off the remaining 1:54 of the carryover penalty. MU did so with ease and even got an opportunity of their own when Siroky made a pass to the front of the net where Morris got a shot on but it was saved. \nMiami took the lead 3:14 into the final frame when Kiefer Sherwood, posted up in the shooting hole, rocketed home the first goal of his young career off of a faceoff win by Morris. Following the Red & White tally, the Buckeyes made a push of their own. David Gust received a stretch pass and was is all alone but McKay made a huge right pad save to maintain the one goal lead. OSU kept up the pressure immediately after, but McKay was up to the task and turned aside every shot of the Buckeye flurry. \nBoth teams took penalties with 4:27 remaining and skated four a side for two minutes. The extra ice benefitted the Buckeyes as Greco tied things up by jamming home a net front feed passed McKay. \nThe RedHawks wasted no time regaining the lead as Jack Roslovic collected his second tally of the season on a wrister just in front of the crease with 1:33 left in regulation. Josh Melnick made a great individual play along the boards, giving a feed to Morris, who snapped the shot on net and it rebounded right into the bread basket of Roslovic. \nOSU had its chances in the closing seconds but McKay shut it down as Miami claimed the 3-2 win. \nImage and information provided by Miami University Athletics Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:17:11.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
