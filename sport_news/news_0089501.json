He felt pride watching Butler earn his first All-Star appearance and win the NBA's most improved player award.\nSo Rose gave his backcourt mate a designer watch with a price tag college-tuition-paying parents would recognize.\nRose is demonstratively sheepish, almost embarrassed, when asked about this gesture in a rare quiet moment. Typically, Rose's preferred path is to remain behind the scenes.\nThat preference gets interrupted often by the basketball skills that place him in the spotlight and injuries and occasional clumsy comments that draw scrutiny and scorn. But pressed further about why he did this, Rose suddenly turns stone-cold serious, bordering on emotional.\n\"I'm a veteran now. You're supposed to spoil your teammates. And Jimmy deserved it,\" Rose said in an interview with the Tribune. \"That's just like me getting doughnuts for the plane and for the buses and for trips. Just trying to do something, let everyone know I'm in it to win it all. We have to have that bond.\"\nTold that this gesture might fly in the face of the Rose-Butler feud narrative, Rose smiled.\n\"That's so far from the truth. We don't even talk about it,\" Rose said. \"It's people just nitpicking our team, trying to start something. I look at Jimmy like a little brother. I wish him nothing but the best. I encourage him every time he's in the game and want him to have that confidence like he has.\"\nThere likely will be times this season when that storyline surfaces again. There even may be times when it has hints of validity, at least in terms of their offensive roles. They are, after all, two strong-willed competitors adjusting to a new offense and, in Butler's case after his offseason max contract, new statuses.\nRose will remain unswayed and undeterred. Rose never has been worried about public criticism or trying to change negative perception of him.\nThe backlash to his decision to skip the 2012-13 season after left ACL surgery surprised him. Privately, it even stung him at times because, yes, doctors cleared him to play if he felt mentally and physically ready ; and, yes, the organization hoped he would continue his rehab by playing.\nBut, no, Rose never felt right and thought it best for his long-term future to sit. So he sat, reaction be damned.\nTwo torn meniscus injuries followed, limiting Rose to 61 regular-season and 12 postseason games over the last three seasons.\nRose's prodigious athletic skills remain mostly intact when he plays, evidenced again Friday when he pushed the ball upcourt with almost unparalleled pace and consistently shredded the Mavericks defense in his first game action in more than five months.\nBut his injuries and long periods of inactivity have dropped him from the forefront of people's minds when the game's elite are mentioned. Recent media rankings placed him low on the league's point-guard food chain, and Nate Silver's fivethirtyeight.com projected his career path to that of T.J. Ford's.\nThat's quite the arbitrary fall from grace for the youngest most valuable player in NBA history.\n\"I never worry about stuff like that. And as far as (public) criticism, I'm just numb to it,\" Rose said. \"I know how great I am. I've always had this inner confidence and I always want to help my team win. So when I'm in the game, I let all that other stuff slip by and just go ball out.\"\nRose, who, counting his missed season, is entering his eighth year, is supremely confident. But it's also funny to hear him occasionally talk almost like an undrafted rookie. He has a new coaching staff and a new system. And, coming off a season in which he shot too many 3-pointers and did so poorly at a career-low 28 percent, so much to prove — still.\nThat he missed virtually all of training camp after a fractured left orbital makes that even more so.\n\"All this is just the beginning. I'm trying to rebuild my game and get better every day,\" Rose said. \"Even in practice, I'm pushing myself and trying to impress my coaches. Look at (assistant coach) Jim Boylen. He has seen Hakeem (Olajuwon), Tim Duncan, a lot of great talent. He has been on championship teams. I want to let him know I'm one of those great talents.\n\"In Coach Fred's offense, there are so many opportunities to drive and shoot my mid-range in transition. It's open. I just have to get used to playing this way. I know it may sound crazy, but playing in a system for three or four years kind of got me out of a rhythm. All (Hoiberg) has to do is yell at me a couple of times. I learned back in camp that he wanted me to push it. I'm trying to get used to it.\"\nIt can't be overstated what this offseason meant for Rose in basketball terms. For the first summer since 2011, when he lorded over the league as the reigning MVP, he worked out as a player, not a rehab patient.\nIt's why he entered this season with such confidence. It's why that confidence remains despite his facial fracture and him donning a mask for Tuesday's opener against LeBron James and the Cavaliers.\n\"I was able to breathe, relax,\" Rose said of the offseason. \"I could work out whenever I wanted to, pick the days I wanted to rest. I've learned my body enough to know when to overdo it and when to rest. When you have surgery, you have to rehab and those things are out of your control.\"\nSo much about Rose's career — injuries, public perception — is also out of his control. Like his gift to Butler, Rose tries to focus on what's important, what remains in his grasp.\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Derrick Rose Jimmy Butler Chicago Bulls NBA T.J.
