On Sunday, it didn't. \nCompeting in his first World Cup race in 19 months, the Norwegian placed 24th in the season-opening giant slalom, more than four seconds behind winner Ted Ligety. \nThe Rettenbach glacier makes for one of the most challenging GS courses on the men's circuit, with an icy surface and a steep pitch. \nSeeking a return to his best form for upcoming speed races, the two-former overall champion says \"I am feeling relaxed about this. I hoped to be faster but I also knew it would be a tough race.
