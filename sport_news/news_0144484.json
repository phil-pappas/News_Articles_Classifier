Overall, the Long Island, N.Y., native is leading the Big Ten in completion percentage (72.0) while passing for 794 yards, six touchdowns and five interceptions.\nSome of those totals were padded by the Week 1 triumph over Norfolk State, a game in which Laviano completed all four of his passes for 138 yards and three touchdowns while playing only in the second half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:21:34.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
