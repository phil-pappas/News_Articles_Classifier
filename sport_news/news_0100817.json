Saturday, Alvarez’s Badgers will play Nebraska on Tom Osborne Field. As it happens, the ex-Wisconsin coach likes to tell a story about a conversation with the ex-Nebraska coach from a time when Osborne was the Cornhuskers’ AD. \n“He called and asked if I would share with him what I was paying my coaches, football and basketball,” Alvarez says, leaning back in his office chair. “So I said, ‘Sure,’ and I told him. There was this long hesitation and then Tom said, ‘You and I got out a little too early.’ ” \nAlvarez lets loose a long laugh. His last full season coaching Wisconsin football was 2005. USA TODAY Sports began tracking top-tier coaches’ salaries in 2006. The average compensation for head football coaches at 119 major colleges then was roughly $950,000. Today, at 128 Football Bowl Subdivision schools, it is up to just over $2 million. College football coaches piling up more cash through bonuses \nThat means the average compensation package is up more than 110% — and, even adjusting for inflation, has nearly doubled in a decade. The trend to ever-richer contracts boils down to this: Schools frequently pay more, and sometimes much more, to retain a coach or to hire a new one. And that’s where Alvarez is getting the last laugh. DATABASE: What each coach makes \nWisconsin is the anti-trend of compensation inflation. Paul Chryst is making $2.3 million to coach the Badgers this season. That’s the same amount Gary Andersen was set to make at Wisconsin this season, before he left for Oregon State, where he is making $2.45 million. Alvarez did not make a big-money bid to keep Andersen. \nBret Bielema was making $2.64 million at Wisconsin when he left for Arkansas after the 2012 season for a $3.2 million deal. Alvarez hired Andersen from Utah State for far less — $1.8 million. (And if Bielema were still at Wisconsin, he’d be making at least $2.9 million this season.) Chryst’s compensation package is No. 41 among the 52 public schools in the Power Five conferences — and Wisconsin is a rare example of a Power Five school where the football coach is making less today than in 2012. \n“I think all our coaches are paid fairly,” Alvarez says. “I don’t pay attention to the trend. We don’t normally look nationally to see where our coaches are ranked. We’ll look in our league.” \nChryst’s compensation ranks No. 9 among the 14 Big Ten schools, where the median salary is $2.5 million. The median is more meaningful in this case because Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh ($7 million, including a $2 million one-time signing bonus) and Ohio State’s Urban Meyer ($5.86 million) skew the average high while Illinois interim coach Bill Cubit ($916,000) skews it low. \nWisconsin chancellor Rebecca Blank criticizes her Big Ten peers who are paying their football coaches so much. \n“Those are the choices they make,” she says. “That really begins to threaten the whole sense that we are not professional athletic teams. I’m not terribly happy about the fact that they made those choices. That’s my opinion.” Wisconsin chancellor says Michigan, Ohio State overpaying coaches Alvarez doesn’t share it. \n“I look at it as their business,” he says. “I do. I don’t concern myself. I don’t feel like we’re in competition with salaries at Ohio State or Michigan. … When you’re Ohio State and football is as important as it is in that state, and you have an opportunity to hire someone who has a couple of national championships in his hip pocket and is from that state, it makes sense to pay him. He’s that valuable. … And Harbaugh, I think it’s a coup for Michigan and our league. I think he is worthy of that salary. That’s what they can command. The market drives that.” \nBlank understands market forces. She was acting secretary of commerce in the Obama administration and holds a doctorate in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \n“Well, clearly the market for football and basketball coaches is a whole lot tighter than the market for chancellors and presidents,” she says, chuckling. Her salary is $499,950. ‘Pretty fortunate’ \nChryst’s Badgers are 3-2 and fell out of the top 25 rankings after Saturday’s home loss to Iowa. But fans here will give him time. He’s one of them. \nChryst was born in Madison, 50 years ago next month. His father, George, was an assistant football coach at Wisconsin and a high school football and basketball coach in Madison who’d one day move his family 75 miles west to coach football at Wisconsin-Platteville. As athletics director there, George Chryst hired Bo Ryan, who’d win four Division III national championships in men’s basketball — and who’d go on to be the longtime Wisconsin coach who took the Badgers to the past two Final Fours. \nPaul Chryst is making $2.3 million in his first season as Wisconsin's head coach. (Photo: Jeff Hanisch, USA TODAY Sports) \nThat means Chryst’s father — who died in 1993, at 55 — sired and hired the current coaches of Wisconsin’s top sports. What would he make of that? \n“He’d have to do a double take to see Bo coaching basketball and me coaching football” at Wisconsin, Chryst says. “But he’d be proud.” \nChryst played football at Wisconsin, as his father had. And he followed his father into the family business, coaching as an assistant at 10 stops (including college, Canadian Football League and NFL) before arriving at Wisconsin for his second coaching tour of duty in 2005. He was the Badgers’ offensive coordinator before getting the head coaching gig at Pittsburgh in 2012. Three seasons later he’s happy to be back, with a clear understanding that to remain a favorite son his Badgers will have to win. \nAnd for the record, even if Wisconsin represents the anti-trend, Chryst does not think of himself as underpaid — at all. \n“My dad would roll over,” he says. “You know what I mean? To get paid to do what you love, pretty fortunate. You can’t say you’re worth that. You’re a lobster at market price, right? There’s value to it, you have an impact on kids, but to say you’re worth that, it’s so wrong. Teachers, nurses — my sister is a pediatrics nurse — that’s real stuff.” \nTwo brothers also found their callings in sports. Geep Chryst is offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers and Rick Chryst is former commissioner of the Mid-American Conference. \nChryst learned more than football from his father. He says he also learned coaching is a lucky life: “My dad always used to say, ‘If I can just do this a few more years I will have worked my whole life without ever having a job.’ ” Call for a salary cap \nBlank, chancellor since 2013, has given the issue of coaches’ salaries a good deal of thought — and she offers a radical fix. \n“Coaches are being paid, especially in a couple of big sports, increasingly like professional leagues,” she says. “It immediately raises the question of, ‘Why aren’t your athletes being paid similarly?’ If I could redo this, I would try to get some sort of antitrust exemption here and say, ‘We run a college sports program — and college sports programs are different. And we do have the right to cap salaries, given the salary levels that exist elsewhere around the university.’ \n“And the expectation is that these students are students, as well as athletes, meaning it is not a for-profit program. People who want to make those kinds of salaries need to be in professional sports. I’m a losing voice on that right now. … I don’t think anyone believes it’s going to happen.” \nAlvarez dismisses all that as “her opinion. If it’s not going to happen, there’s no use discussing it.” \nBarry Alvarez coach the Badgers from 1990-2005 and had interim stints in 2012 and '14. (Photo: Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports) \nBlank says she is pleased to be chancellor at a school where she and other officials consider the athletics department to be self-funding. Wisconsin’s athletics department is not one of the two dozen that are self-sufficient by the NCAA’s reckoning of generated revenue versus total expenditure. But Meredith McGlone, UW’s director of news and media relations, says Wisconsin doesn’t use the NCAA’s formula because it doesn’t account for all the funding the athletics department gives back. She says the department didn’t offer methodology or funding numbers, just that it gives back more money than it receives. \nAthletics departments typically get money from student fees, university funds and/or government support, but they also send money to their schools through payments for scholarships and facilities and through other transfers. When those amounts are balanced, according to a USA TODAY Sports analysis, all 50 of the public schools that were in a Power Five conference in 2013-14 were self-sufficient. \nWisconsin reported to the NCAA that it provided $8.1 million in forms of university support to the athletics department in 2013-14, and that the department spent a combined total of $52.2 million on scholarships, facilities and other transfers. \n“Consistently, year after year, the athletics department has given money back to campus,” Blank says. Do Kevin Sumlin and Texas A&M want more money? #Yessir! \nWisconsin’s athletics department says it made a roughly $5 million transfer to the university in 2014-15. Blank says she has asked athletics to raise the amount it gives back by $2 million in the coming year, when the school plans to cut $86 million from its overall budget because of state budget cuts to education that total $250 million statewide this year. \n“We are a total university, and I wasn’t going to cut educational programs deeply and leave no cuts elsewhere,” Blank says. “We tried as hard as we can to have everyone share in the cuts, so I asked the athletic department to make a larger contribution back to the university in the next year. They were very willing to do that. That’s a cut for them because it’s money they can’t spend.” \nBlank says when she puts her economist’s hat on she sees clear differences between college and pro sports. She says Wisconsin athletics makes money on football and men’s basketball and often men’s hockey — and loses money on 20 other sports. \n“Now, if I were running a business, I’d abolish those and run three,” she says. “But I’m not running a business. I’m running a college sports enterprise, among other things. And I think there is an enormous value to athletics and sports for young individuals, both men and women.” \nAlvarez says he appreciates the Big Ten’s philosophy of broad-based sports programs. \n“Some of the other conferences choose not to do that,” he says. “They’re more focused on football. And basketball, but primarily football. If you have seven fewer sports, you figure, generally speaking — except for football and basketball and, in our case, hockey — generally you’re going to lose $2 million per sport. \n“So if you’ve got seven fewer sports, and you’ve got the same size stadium and everything equal to us — that money can go wherever you choose it to go. … And that may be one of the reasons why you have a big discrepancy in salaries. They have more of an availability because they have fewer sports.” \nGALLERY: Top 35 highest-paid coaches No. 1: Nick Saban, Alabama: $7,087,481. Saban’s total pay is slightly lower than it was in 2014 primarily because he reported about $55,000 less in athletically related outside income this year than he did last year. Marvin Gentry, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 2: Jim Harbaugh, Michigan: $7,004,000. The former San Francisco 49ers coach’s total includes a $2 million signing bonus. But his overall pay package does yet include the terms of a deferred-pay arrangement the parties are to discuss after the season. Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 3: Urban Meyer, Ohio State: $5,860,000. Following the Buckeyes’ national title last season, Meyer’s contract was extended by three years and his pay from the school for this season increased by nearly $1.4 million over what it was for last season. His bonus maximum also increased to $775,000 from $550,000. Peter Casey, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 4: Bob Stoops, Oklahoma: $5,400,000. As scheduled under a contract he signed in 2014, Stoops’ pay for this season rose by about $350,000 more than what it was last season. It is set to increase by $150,000 a year in the future. Mark D. Smith, USA TODAY Sports No. 5: Jimbo Fisher, Florida State: $5,150,000. Fisher received a new eight-year contract in 2015. His pay has nearly tripled since 2010, including $2.4 million in increases over the past two years. Melina Vastola, USA TODAY Sports No. 6: Charlie Strong, Texas: $5,100,270. Strong’s pay increased from last season by a previously scheduled $100,000. Brendan Maloney, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 7: Kevin Sumlin, Texas A&M: $5,000,000. Although Sumlin’s contract was restructured to include a licensing agreement related to Texas A&M’s use of his name, image and likeness on merchandise, his pay remains unchanged – and is scheduled to remain unchanged through the 2019 season. Thomas Shea, USA TODAY Sports No. 8: James Franklin, Penn State: $4,400,00. Franklin’s pay increased from last season by a previously scheduled $100,000. Matthew O'Haren, USA TODAY Sports No. 9: Les Miles, LSU: $4,388,721. Miles is making $4.3 million in basic compensation from the school for a third consecutive year. Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 10: Hugh Freeze, Mississippi: Last season, Freeze led his team to its highest national ranking since 1964. He was rewarded with a $1.3 million raise that means his pay from the school has nearly tripled since 2012, when he made $1.5 million. He made $2 million in 2013 and $3 million last season. Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 11: Art Briles, Baylor: $4,236,073. Because Baylor is a private school, Briles’ total is the one reported on the university’s most recently available federal income tax returns, which cover compensation for the 2013 calendar year, including benefits and bonuses paid. Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 12: Mark Richt, Georgia: $4,124,000. Richt received a two-year contract extension after last season that runs through 2019 and included an $800,000 increase in his basic pay from the school for this season and an $800,000 increase in the maximum amount of bonus money he can receive. Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports No. 13: Gus Malzahn, Auburn: $4,104,500. Malzahn’s move into the $4 million club was built into a contract extension he received in 2014. His pay from the school is set to keep increasing by $250,000 a year. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 14: Kirk Ferentz, Iowa: $4,075,000. Now in the second half of a 10-year deal that runs through Jan. 31, 2020, Ferentz’s pay remained unchanged from 2014, but his potential bonus maximum increased by $625,000 under a contract amendment he signed in December 2014. Reese Strickland, USA TODAY Sports No. 15: Steve Spurrier, South Carolina: $4,028,600. Spurrier’s compensation from the school for this season is unchanged from last season. Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 16: Dan Mullen, Mississippi State: $4,000,000: In the middle of last season, the Bulldogs went from unranked to No. 1. After the season, Mullen went from making $3 million with $710,000 in possible bonuses to making $4 million with $900,000 in possible bonuses. Soobum Im, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 17: Jim McElwain, Florida: $3,983,359. McElwain’s pay for his first season at Florida is inflated above its annualized rate because it covers an elongated initial contract year that began Dec. 5, 2014 and runs through Jan. 31, 2016. His pay from Colorado State last year was set at $1.5 million. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 18: Bret Bielema, Arkansas: $3,960,666: On an annualized basis, Bielema’s pay rate following a contract extension is $4 million. But that rate became effective after the start of his current contract year. He is scheduled to make $4.1 million in 2016. He made $3.2 million from the school in 2014. Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 19: Gary Patterson, TCU: $3,940,026. Because TCU is a private school, Patterson’s total is the one reported on the university’s most recently available federal income tax returns, which covers compensation for the 2013 calendar year, including benefits and bonuses paid. Jesse Johnson, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 20: Gary Pinkel, Missouri: $3,768,889. On an annualized basis, Pinkel’s pay rate following a contract extension is $4.02 million. But that rate became effective after the start of his current contract year. He is set to make $4.12 million in 2016. Excluding performance bonuses, he made $3.4 million from the school in 2014. Mark Zerof, USA TODAY Sports No. 21: Mark Dantonio, Michigan State: $3,671,520. Dantonio received a $2 million, one-time longevity payment during his previous contract year. This year, his recurring annual pay from the school rose by about $50,000. Mike Carter, USA TODAY Sports No. 22: Mike Gundy, Oklahoma State: $3,650,000. Gundy’s pay increased by a previously scheduled $150,000 over what he received last season. It is set to increase by $125,000 next season. Mike Carter, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 23: Butch Jones, Tennessee: $3,633,000. Jones was another SEC coach to get a contract extension and sizable pay increase after last season, when he helped the Vols have their first winning season since 2009. He’s making $650,000 more from the school this season than he did last season. Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 24: Chris Petersen, Washington: $3,402,940. Petersen’s pay for his first season with the Huskies was inflated above its annualized rate because it covered an elongated initial contract year that ran nearly 14 months. Regardless, he remains the highest-paid coach at a Pacific-12 Conference public school. Jennifer Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports No. 25: Jim Mora, UCLA: $3,350,000. Mora’s pay increased by a previously scheduled $100,000 over what he received last season. It is set to keep rising by $100,000 per season. Casey Sapio, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 26: Dabo Swinney, Clemson: $3,305,200. Swinney’s pay increased from last season’s by a previously scheduled $150,000. It is set to go up by another $150,000 in 2016, but that raise is contractually required to be $200,000 if the Tigers win the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports No. 27: Rich Rodriguez, Arizona: $3,238,844. Rodriguez picked up a one-year contract extension through May 31, 2020, after the Wildcats went 10-4 last season, including appearances in the Pacific-12 Conference championship game and the Fiesta Bowl. Casey Sapio, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 28: Mark Stoops, Kentucky: $3,263,600. Stoops passed the $3 million mark under an increase built into the contract extension he received in the middle of last season. The new deal lets him get as much as $2.775 million in bonuses in a year, including $250,000 for each win beginning with the seventh win of a season. Mark Zerof, USA TODAY Sports No. 29: Mike London, Virginia: $3,198,400. In January 2015, London triggered a one-time payment of $750,000 for completing three-plus years of a five-year contract that runs through Dec. 7, 2016. Amber Searls, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 30: Mark Helfrich, Oregon: $3,150,000. About four weeks after the Ducks played in the College Football Playoff national title game, Helfrich signed a new, five-year contract that included a $1.15 million raise over what he made last season. His bonus maximum was increased by $500,000 to $1.635 million. Mike Carter, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 31: Kliff Kingsbury, Texas Tech: $3,147,500.Kingsbury signed a new contract just before the start of the 2014 season. Between an initial raise that occurred when the deal took effect and another $500,000 jump for this season, he is now making over $1.25 million more than he was in 2013. Michael C. Johnson, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 32: Bobby Petrino. Louisville: $3,003,500. Petrino’s basic guaranteed pay is unchanged from last season. But each year, he can get an additional $500,000 if the team’s NCAA Academic Progress Rate (APR) figure is 935 or above – which was the case in 2014. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 33: Todd Graham, Arizona State: $3,002,960. Graham became the $3 million club’s newest in mid-September, when the Arizona Board of Regents approved a one-year extension and a raise from $2.8 million, which was $100,000 more than he made last season. Graham also can get more than $3.7 million in bonuses. Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports No. 34: Bill Snyder, Kansas State: $3,000,000. A previously scheduled $100,000 raise moved Snyder up to $3 million, and he is set for future $100,000 annual increases. Scott Sewell, USA TODAY Sports No. 35: Dana Holgorsen, West Virginia: $2,880,000: Holgorsen went above $3 million last season, when he received a one-time retention payment of $300,000.
