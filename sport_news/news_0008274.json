Fellow forward Lily Mynott assisted on the goal. \nMillburn pulled even for the second time when forward Lauren Dresner tapped in a pass from Mynott 10 minutes into the second half. \nJordan scored the winning goal off a pass from midfielder Melissa Gula on an offensive corner. \nMiller goalie Emily Blumstein recorded eight saves. \n\"It was a very 50/50 game,\" Miller head coach Sarah Pallino said. \n\"We both had similar shots on goal as well as the same amount of corners. We just took advantage of one of the last offensive opportunities of the game. We played very well together yesterday.\" \nMillburn, by a quirk in the schedule, will now play back-to-back matches against Montclair. \nThe teams are scheduled to meet in an Essex-Union Field Hockey Conference match today, Oct. 8, at 4 p.m. at Millburn High School's Miller Field. \n\"The competition gets tougher as we move higher into the bracket,\" Pallino said. \n\"Saturday's game will be tough. Montclair has fast aggressive players who are always skilled. I am confident that this will be the year we will beat them. Playing them today will be an advantage that we will see how they work together, but a disadvantage that they will be able to do the same.\" \nThe Millers carry a 5-0-1 unbeaten streak into today's match against the 8-2 Mounties. \nEmail: connellyj@northjersey.com Â© 2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:14:59.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
