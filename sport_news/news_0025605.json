But Wednesday, the state Appeals Court ruled that parishioners of St. Frances X. Cabrini Church are trespassing, and will need to leave.\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston decided to shutter the Scituate church in 2004 as part of its reorganization plan. At the time, then-archbishop Sean O’Malley said that declining attendance, aging priests and increased maintenance costs meant dozens of churches would close, and their congregations would merge with other parishes.\nBut those who attend St. Frances X. Cabrini had other ideas. Since Oct. 26, 2004, a group of about 100 people known as the “Friends of St. Frances X. Cabrini” have made sure at least one parishioner is inside the church at all times. They’ve passed the time with prayer and puzzles, and have slept on lumpy mattresses during overnight shifts.\n “Since the inception of their vigil they have sought and prayed for meaningful dialogue in effort to attain a fair and equitable resolution for both the Archdiocese of Boston and the parish of St. Frances X. Cabrini,” the Friends said in a statement Wednesday. “Yet, this has never happened.”\nThe parishioners filed several appeals without success. In June 2014, they lost their appeal to the Apostolic Signatura, which is the Vatican’s highest court. In February, the archdiocese sued the group when they wouldn’t vacate the church, saying they were trespassing. A Norfolk Superior Court judge sided with the church in May and told them to leave.\nThey appealed, and continued their vigil. The final decision came Wednesday, when the appeals court ruled that the archdiocese—not the parishioners—owns the building and has the right to make decisions about its properties.\n“While we acknowledge the defendants’ heartfelt beliefs that they are entitled to remain on the premises as an exercise of their freedom of religion, the judge’s conclusion that the defendants are trespassers is supported by the evidence,” the ruling said.\nIn a statement Wednesday, archdiocese spokesman Terrence Donilon asked that parishioners consider joining other churches.\n“We appreciate the court having taken the time to review this matter and issue its ruling,” he said. “We ask the Friends of St. Frances to respect that decision and conclude the vigil. The parishes of the Archdiocese welcome and invite those involved with the vigil to participate and join in the fullness of parish life.”\nIt is not yet clear whether the group will be forced to leave, or when that might happen. The Friends are holding a press conference at the church at 11 a.m. today, and said Wednesday they are still waiting to review their options with their attorney.", "external_links": ["http://www.bostoncatholic.org/uploadedFiles/Parish_Reconfiguration_statement040525.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:05:14.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
