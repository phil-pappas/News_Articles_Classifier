I just kind of walk straight forward.\" \nAll offense and no defense only works if it results in a knockout—otherwise, it can cost points in a decision. This point resonates with Lemenager, who also plays goalie for the Proctor-Hermantown Mirage (PHM) hockey team. \n\"Whenever you make a mistake, it shows up on the scoreboard,\" she said. \"Everybody sees it.\" \nEven with going from a blistering offensive front to what is now a more balanced strategy, the game plan is exactly the same. \n\"Not giving it her all or everything she's got is not even an option for her,\" Moore said. \nActually—scratch that—the game plan is just slightly different this time. \n\"I plan on going to Nova Scotia and showing her I'm not 'Minnesota Nice,'\" Lemenager said. \nSounds like she's ready to rumble.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:56:02.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
