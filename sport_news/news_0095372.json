Heading into district play, questions surrounded Pittsburg as they moved to the difficult portion of their schedule. Those questions were answered out of the gate as the Purple Dragons jumped out to a 28-0 lead in the first quarter on the way to a 56-13 win over Blue Valley West Friday in Overland Park. Moving to 7-0 on the season, Pittsburg had touchdowns in all three phases of the game against the Jaguars in the opening quarter. Running back Sherrick Rogers accounted for three touchdowns, scoring twice on offense and once on defense in the win. Pittsburg’s defense had a pair of touchdowns, with one on an interception return and the other on a fumble return for a touchdown. The scoring started quickly for the Purple Dragon offense. After a three-and-out by the defense, Pittsburg quarterback Spencer Turnbull dropped back on second and 7 and hit Elijah Harris for a first down. Harris caught the ball for 10 yards, made a move, and ran away from the defense on the way to a 62-yard score for the first points of the game. Pittsburg pushed the lead to 14-0 after the Jaguars were driving down in the PHS red zone and fumbled the ball on a first-and-goal run from the PHS 9-yard line. Sherrick Rogers picked the ball up for the Purple Dragons and ran the rock for a 94-yard scoop-and-score touchdown. On the ensuing PHS possession on second down, Rogers took the toss to the tackle, cutback, and burst through the hole on the way to a 73-yard touchdown run with 3:49 left in the opening quarter, putting PHS up 21-0. On four offensive plays, the Purple Dragons had a 21-0 lead. The Purple Dragons pushed the advantage to four touchdowns when — after the defense put the Jaguars in a fourth-and-20 situation — the PHS special teams blocked a punt and returned it for a 15-yard touchdown with 1:34 left in the first. The Jaguars got on the scoreboard following a 5-yard pitch-and-catch from BVW quarterback Nathan Wiles to Brandon Shaw to cut the Purple Dragons’ lead to 28-6. It was all Pittsburg during the rest of the second quarter. PHS drove the ball down inside the BVW 10-yard line before back-to-back penalties put them at second and goal from the BVM 35. Turnbull faked the handoff to Rogers and tossed a pass downfield to hit tight end Trevor Kent at the five, with Kent fighting his way into the end zone for the touchdown. The Dragons weren’t done, as Rogers took a handoff for 80-yards and a touchdown near the end of the half to put Pittsburg in the locker room with a 42-6 lead. Coming out of the half, Pittsburg put an exclamation point on their win with a seven-play, 77-yard drive which resulted in a 27-yard touchdown run on an option keeper from Turnbull. With more than 8:00 to play in the third quarter, PHS held a 49-6 lead over BVW.
