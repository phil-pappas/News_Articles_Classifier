Brown decision helps San Diego stadium proposal, mayor says Associated Press Published 5:13 pm, Thursday, October 22, 2015 \nSan Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said the city’s push to build a stadium for the Chargers took “a huge step forward” when Gov. Jerry Brown approved an accelerated judicial-review process for any lawsuits filed against the project’s environmental-impact report. \nOnce enacted by the legislature’s joint budget committee, the certification means any lawsuit challenging the EIR must be resolved within 270 days of the city’s certifying the document. The city thinks it can open a stadium by 2019 even if there is litigation. \n“The governor stood up for San Diego and that’s a very good thing,” Faulconer said Thursday. \nChargers attorney Mark Fabiani disagreed, saying the 270-day certification “is unfortunately irrelevant at this point” and the “quickie EIR is fatally flawed.” \nThe city has proposed building a stadium at the site of Qualcomm Stadium in Mission Valley. \nFabiani walked away from negotiations in mid-June, in large part because of concerns with the EIR. The Chargers have focused on moving to the Los Angeles area, which will require approval by the league. \nThe Chargers and their rivals, the Raiders, have proposed a joint stadium in Carson, an industrial suburb of Los Angeles, if they can’t get new stadiums in their home markets. \nPats delete tweet: The Patriots’ official Twitter account sent out — and then deleted — a picture of the New York Jets ’ embarrassing “butt fumble” as the AFC East teams approach Sunday’s game in New England. \nWith a hashtag for “Throwback Thursday” and the caption, “This seems relevant,” the Patriots sent the picture of Mark Sanchez losing the football after running into the rear end of offensive lineman Brandon Moore in 2012. The tweet was deleted, but a screenshot of it was published by the New York Post. \nThe Patriots (5-0) host the Jets (4-1) on Sunday for the division lead. \nBriefly: New England released defensive lineman Khyri Thornton from the 53-man roster and offensive lineman Brennan Williams from the practice squad. Thornton was a third-round draft pick by the Packers. The Patriots claimed him off waivers last month. ... Chicago signed defensive lineman Ziggy Hood and cut defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff . ... Jacksonville running back T.J. Yeldon (groin) practiced and might play against Buffalo on Sunday.
