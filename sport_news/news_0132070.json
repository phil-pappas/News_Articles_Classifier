It's a different type of cricket to England, there'll be huge amounts of spin being bowled and slow, attritional cricket.\" \nEngland's head coach Trevor Bayliss and his assistant Paul Farbrace have both worked with Sri Lanka in the past, and that knowledge of sub-continental cricket could be a secret weapon for the tourists. \n\"Trevor has lots of experience and coached Sri Lanka so that will come in very handy in helping our guys develop,\" said Prior, who retired in June due to injury. \n\"It is a chance for them to learn more about their game, play on these kind of wickets and improve themselves. \n\"Trevor is an outstanding coach and he has the task of taking the talent in that dressing room from strength to strength. \n\"With the likes of Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler at his disposal that is hugely exciting.\" \nPakistan may never have lost a Test series in their adopted home, but Prior's former England team-mate Graeme Swann is confident that will change. \nSpeaking at the Sir Bobby Robson Celebrity Golf Day at Rockliffe Hall Hotel, Swann said: \"I think it will be a tough series for England but I'm hopeful they can do well. \n\"I think they'll sneak the series 2-0. The bowlers did well last time but the batsmen really struggled with some of the spinners over there, but they're not the force they were now the ICC have changed the laws on straight arms a little bit.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:41:49.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
