By Marc Weiszer ATHENS — Georgia will have to wait until this Saturday to get rid of the bad taste left from Alabama’s emphatic 38-10 manhandling of the Bulldogs over the weekend.\nTennessee is looking to stop the bleeding of its own.\nThe Bulldogs (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) tumbled down 11 spots Sunday in The Associated Press poll to No. 19 and 10 in the coaches’ poll to No. 16 heading into a 3:30 p.m. game in Knoxville that will be aired on CBS.\nTennessee (2-3, 0-2) lost in overtime to Oklahoma, by one at Florida and is coming off a 24-20 home loss to Arkansas, the Razorbacks’ first road SEC win since 2012.\n“We know we’ll be going into a very hostile environment with a really hungry football team,” Georgia coach Mark Richt said. “We’re hungry, too.”\nGeorgia is coming off a game in which it managed just 106 passing yards, its fewest since Nov. 28, 2009 against Georgia Tech (a 30-24 Georgia win).\nRicht said Sunday night that Greyson Lambert will remain the starting quarterback. He has started all five games this season, and Richt said there won’t be a competition for the starting job with Brice Ramsey like in the preseason.\n“We’re not going to do that,” Richt said. “Right now, it’s going to be Lambert.”\nLambert was 10 of 24 for 86 yards and an interception in the home loss to Alabama. He was replaced by Ramsey late in the second quarter after he threw incompletions on seven of his previous eight passes.\n“I’ve got to play better,” Lambert said.\nRamsey didn’t exactly seize the moment in the rain. He was 1 of 6 for 20 yards with two interceptions before Lambert returned to the game on the fifth series of the third quarter.\nRicht said one of Ramsey’s interceptions was a miscommunication “in what he thought the receiver was going to do. You’ve got to cut the ball loose with the faith of a certain route being run a certain way, and that was one of the issues.”\nThe other Ramsey pass picked off was more on the quarterback.\n“The other one, I think he’d have been better off going to a check-down on that particular one,” Richt said.\nLambert set an NCAA record for completion percentage against South Carolina two weeks earlier.\n“When you have a game where a quarterback hits 24 out of 25 or whatever the heck it is, a lot of good things have to happen, like I’ve been saying all along,” Richt said. “Protection, route running, ball catching and accurate throws. We had some protection issues. We had some drop issues. We had some accuracy issues. It wasn’t the best conditions to throw and catch for anybody. But again, Alabama caused a lot of those problems, and we’ve got to react better to those.”\nGeorgia lost in a game in which Alabama had a blocked punt for touchdown and an interception return for touchdown.\nThe Bulldogs had eight penalties for 82 yards, including a personal foul on freshman Roquan Smith on a late hit after an Alabama punt return. That gave the Crimson Tide the ball on the Georgia 38 in a drive that Alabama cashed in on Jake Coker’s 2-yard bootleg touchdown run. Inside linebacker Tim Kimbrough also was penalized on that drive for a late hit out of bounds.\n“Alabama is an outstanding team,” Richt said. “You can’t help them, that’s for sure.”\nAfter watching the game film, Richt said it wasn’t an effort issue by the players, but the execution was lacking.\nNOTE: Inside linebacker Reggie Carter is expected to be out for the season after having surgery to repair a shoulder injury, Richt confirmed. Carter played just one game this season, making two tackles against Vanderbilt.\nThe junior from Snellville has 38 career tackles. ... Wide receiver/punt and kickoff returner Isaiah McKenzie is “a maybe” in terms of his availability for Saturday. McKenzie sustained a left hamstring injury on a second-quarter punt return. ... Starting center Brandon Kublanow has a sprained ankle and may be questionable for Saturday. “If he had to practice today, I don’t know if he could,” Richt said. “We’ll go day-by-day on him. He sprained his ankle. To what degree, it’s hard to say.” Hunter Long replaced Kublanow in the second half. ... Safety Dominick Sanders “is fine,” Richt said. “I think he had a little stinger, but nothing big.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14784237.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14784237.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:10:08.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
