Saturday's district championship win over Highland secured the program's first district title. \"It means a lot to our program,\" said Head Coach, Angie Resa. Resa is hoping bringing the school its first district softball title will help grow the program into a power in northeast Missouri. \"I think you're seeing kids that maybe didn't think about playing softball before and now they are,\" she said. \"That means huge strides for our kids.\"Senior Pitcher Alex Fenton says her team is ready to continue to make a deep run in the post season because of a level on confidence the Lady Cardinals carry with them.\"We don't get down just because (the other team) scores a couple of runs, or if they're loud. We have a confident team,\" she said. South Shelby gets a (22-3) Centralia team, Thursday, in Centralia for its sectional game.
