We’ll hopefully get them rested so we can see some best times. We have a lot of girls that have already qualified for district.” \nEastlake completed its regular season Oct. 22 at Redmond Pool, improving its record to 5-3 with a 124-54 victory over the Bothell Cougars. \nAgnew shuffled the lineup to give the Wolves a break from their usual events, and they still won 10 of 12 events as senior captains Ally Haase and Mindy Hsu played big roles. \nHsu claimed first place in the 200-yard freestyle (2 minutes, 3.83 seconds) and the 100-yard breaststroke (1:13.78), and Haase was victorious in the 100 free (1:00.75). \nHaase helped the 200 medley relay squad win in 2:04, Hsu was part of a 200 free relay victory in 1:56.46, and both swam for the winning 400 free relay (4:06.10). \n“We’ve got great leadership,” Agnew said of her captains. “They’ve done a really good job this year in being good role models, kind of motivating the other girls to get to that point.” \nHaase is chasing automatic state-qualifying times in two individual events. \n“I’m looking to drop about a second in both the 200 free and the 100 fly, to try to get the state cut for both of them,” she said. “So I have to work a little harder on that and rest a little bit – (I’m) sore, lots of practices.” \nThe state cut is 1:59.90 in the 200 free, 1:00.80 in the 100 fly. \nHsu has district-qualifying times in the 200 free and 100 breaststroke, but said her focus is making sure the Wolves get their 200 medley relay to state. Sophomores Maya Alderman and Maggie Van Nortwick, as well as freshman Emily Weise, have helped put the Wolves in striking distance – their best time is two-hundredths of a second short of the automatic state mark of 1:55.90. \n“Our medley relay has been pretty strong the past couple years, and I hope to continue that, continue the trend,” Hsu said. “We’re definitely looking to get that time at KingCo.” \nOther Eastlake winners against Bothell included Weise in the 50 free (27.63) and 500 free (5:56.76); Alderman in the 100 butterfly (1:03.62); and Van Nortwick in the 100 backstroke (1:09.52). \nEastlake’s sights are set on posting personal-best times at the conference, district and state meets. They’re also looking beyond this year with a 20-member freshman class. \n“I’m excited to see what they have to bring next year and into the future,” Agnew said. \nThe coach has leaned on Hsu and Haase to develop the younger swimmers, and they’ve eagerly accepted the task. \n“Being a good role model, being someone that they can look up to and someone that they want to be like, that’s very important because we’re not going to be here forever,” Hsu said. “Every year, captains change, and every year the team dynamic is different, and so we just hope this year’s juniors can look at us captains and say, ‘Wow, I want to be like them and I want to continue what they’ve done.’” \n“It’s been really nice, just because even though there’s so many of us, I feel like we’re all super close,” Haase added. \nWritten by Neil Pierson · Filed Under Eastlake High School , Sports \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:20:26.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
