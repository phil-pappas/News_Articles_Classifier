You can follow Jones on Twitter at jjones9 . Q 1: Nationally it seems like Carolina’s 4-0 start is being written off as a product of a weak schedule. Are there some reasons to think it is legit? A: There are, but I understand why folks are writing it off. Here are the quarterbacks they’ve faced: Bortles, Mallett, Winston and Luke McCown. Not exactly a murderer’s row. That’s why this game is important for the team. It’ll show it they’re contenders or pretenders. But there are signs. Cam is playing the best football of his career. He has three turnovers and you could explain them all away–a dropped pass for an INT, hit as he threw for a second INT and the center knocking the ball out of his hand on a running play. Then you have Josh Norman, who’s been one of the best corners in the league so far (with those QBs throwing to him). The linebackers have looked great and now Luke Kuechly is back. And finally the Panthers have a strong offensive line in front of Newton. Q2: This is now the fifth time the two teams have played since 2012. Anything much different in what the Panthers are doing? A: Not really outside of Newton being a better quarterback. He’s taking a lot more of what the defense is giving him, which is probably also a product of his less-than-average receiving group. This is still a run-first, time of possession team that wants to grind out games and let the defense win it. I think the secondary is the best its been with the emergence of Norman, the ball hawking skills of Bene Benwikere and the run-stopping play of Kurt Coleman. Q3: What kind of year is Cam Newton having so far? A: I can’t stress enough on important Newton’s play has been though. Folks across the country have been calling him an MVP candidate because they’re stressing the “valuable” part, and it’s tough to disagree. You take those receivers (outside of Greg Olsen) and there aren’t many teams going 4-0 with them. Everyone in the locker room trusts him. He’s not doing the two steps forward, one step backward anymore. If something’s not there, he’s not taking it. It’s a huge difference in his game in year 5.\nQ4: Jonathan Stewart appears healthy and running pretty well. How is he playing and how has his career evolved? A: Outside of Marshawn, Stewart is, in my opinion, the best at absorbing a hit and shedding a would-be tackler. Now that’s also invited some injuries in his career, but he says he’s trained much more in the offseason to prevent the kind of knee and ankle injuries that have hampered him over the years. Stewart’s stats may not reflect how well he’s running though, and it’s an easy explanation. If you were a defense going against this team with these receivers, wouldn’t you dare the Panthers to throw to them? Don’t let Newton and Stewart beat you on the ground and force Cam to throw to these guys. That’s what folks have done by loading eight men in the box regularly, and it’s been tough sledding for Stewart. But there’s no doubt he’s still running well. Q5: What kind of impact is former UW star Shaq Thompson having so far? A: You know I was a little skeptical about the pick at first, but the Panthers have put him in a great position to succeed. They knew safety wasn’t his spot and he told anyone that would listen that he didn’t want to be a running back. He’s a smart linebacker who’s learning to be physical. That was something I thought was missing from his game in college. He had highlight-reel hits, but I saw him get blocked by tight ends and offensive linemen at the second level regularly. Now he’s gotten a mean streak in him, and being beside Thomas Davis has probably helped that. Bob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
