The Cats suffered a 20-14 defeat. « 1 » \nFront Range Christian came to give the Bobcats a real duel for their homecoming game Friday night under the lights. \nThe Falcons carried away the win, 20-14, following a battle that was balanced on both sides of the field for most of the game. \nFront Range scored first booting two field goals through the uprights after the Cats defense stopped their progress down the field early in the first and second quarters of the game. Senior Sam Addison tied the ball game at six when he ran in for a Cat touchdown right before halftime. \nThe Falcons dominated the third quarter scoring their final two touchdowns of the game giving them the 20-6 lead. \nEstes took control of the forth quarter, stopping any further Falcon scoring and adding eight points to their score. Joseph Coleson grabbed a pass from Jordan Duemig and ran in for a second touchdown, followed by a 2-point conversion on a short pass to Addison. \nThe Cats will travel to face Clear Creek 7 p.m. this Friday, Oct. 16.
