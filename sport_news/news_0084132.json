Holmes, who was 12th in the standings. \nFuryk withdrew from the BMW Championship because of a deep bone bruise in his left wrist, and he sat out the Tour Championship last week with hopes it would get better. \nAfter rest and treatment, the 45-year-old Furyk did not think he was fit enough to play. \nU.S. captain Jay Haas picked Holmes to replace him. The Presidents Cup starts Thursday in South Korea. Copyright The Associated Press \n© 2015 Cox Media Group .
