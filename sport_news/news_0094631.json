The suit alleged the shop allowed an illegal sale despite several warning signs that should have prompted a store clerk to stop the transaction and know the gun was being sold to a \"straw buyer,\" or someone who was buying the gun for someone who couldn't legally do so.\nJurors sided with the officers, ruling that the store was negligent in selling the gun.\nOfficer Bryan Norberg and retired Officer Graham Kunisch were both shot in the face after they stopped Julius Burton for riding his bike on the sidewalk in the summer of 2009. Surveillance video shows the officers scuffled with Burton and slammed him into a wall before he shot them both in the face.\nOne bullet shattered eight of Norberg's teeth, blew through his cheek and lodged into his shoulder. He remains on the force but argues that his wounds have made his work difficult. Kunisch was shot several times, resulting in him losing an eye and part of the frontal lobe of his brain. He said the wounds forced him to retire.\nJurors ordered the store to pay Norberg $1.5 million and Kunisch $3.6 million, in addition to $730,000 in punitive damages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:02:25.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
