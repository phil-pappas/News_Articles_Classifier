Defensively it forced the Miners into a three-and-out on their opening possession, which led to good field position for its own first drive.\nThe momentum vanished in a flash. Brighton went backward on its first three plays — a penalty and two sacks — the last of which resulted in a Bingham safety less than three minutes into the game.\nThat was all the scoring Bingham needed as the defense dominated throughout on its way to a 30-0 victory over Brighton to clinch the outright Region 3 championship.\n“We just didn’t want to have to share our region title. We knew we had to win this one to take it,” said Bingham junior running back Jahvontay Smith .\nThe shutout was Bingham’s sixth of the season, and certainly the most impressive to date against one of the better teams in 5A. It did so by recording nine sacks, three interceptions and, in the process, limited the Bengals to just 58 yards of total offense.\n“Anybody that has that type of thing happen for them (early) is going to get on a roll, and we got on a roll on all parts of our game,” said Bingham coach John Lambourne .\nBingham will now shift its attention to the 5A playoffs, opening with American Fork in the first round next Friday — a rematch of last year’s title game.\n“We just need to stay focused and stay humble and take every team that comes to us. We don’t look past anybody,” said Smith.\nBingham is the obvious favorite going in, and will be tough to beat if it plays like it did on Thursday.\nAfter the early punt, Bingham put together three straight lengthy scoring drives to build a 23-0 lead just before halftime.\nSmith capped the first drive with a 19-yard TD run for the 9-0 lead, and then midway through the second quarter he extended the lead to 16-0 on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Matt Degn .\n“During the beginning of the season we had a hard time, but we’re rolling now, the O-line is getting their blocks, they’re doing amazing,” said Smith, who finished with 106 rushing yards.\nJust before halftime, Brady Atkin extended the lead to 23-0 on a 1-yard plunge for the 23-0 lead.\nBingham had 32 combined plays on the three scoring drives. Brighton’s offense ran only 15 total plays from scrimmage in the first half for just 38 yards of offense.\nAtkin increased Bingham’s lead to 30-0 with 7:53 left in the third quarter on a 3-yard run.\nDown big, Brighton tried to air it out in the second half, which led to a pair of interceptions by Simote Lokotui and another from Ethan Erickson .\nDeseret News prep editor and Real Salt Lake beat writer.
