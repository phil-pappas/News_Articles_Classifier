If so, what changes? NFL Junkies Podcast: Examining the rising, falling teams heading into Week 4 \nTOM PELISSERO \nFirst off, I don’t think they fall to 0-4. This is basically the Ravens’ season, they know it and John Harbaugh will have them ready to fight on a short week against a rival that just lost its quarterback. If the Ravens do lose to a Mike Vick-led Steelers team, though? Certainly, some sort of changes may be inevitable, though I don’t see anything “drastic” from one of the NFL’s most consistent franchises. It’s worth noting that giving younger players expanded opportunities isn’t always a death sentence. (Just ask the 2014 Carolina Panthers.) Also, don’t forget Harbaugh’s first season. The Ravens lost three in a row in a stretch of September and October 2008 to fall to 2-3, then rallied to make a run to the AFC title game. This isn’t a bad team, but they can’t waste any more time putting something in the win column. Jerome Bettis: Steelers 'don’t need Mike Vick to win the game' \nNATE DAVIS \nWhat can they really change? The knee-jerk reaction in most cities would be to fire the coach and/or switch quarterbacks. No reason to do either in Baltimore. Besides, Joe Flacco and the offense are hardly the issue for this disappointing team. The loss of OLB Terrrell Suggs to a torn Achilles in Week 1 seems to have had a devastating effect. I saw the Ravens two weeks ago in Oakland, and the pass rush was impotent and exposed the shortcomings in the secondary. Pretty much the same story in Sunday’s home opener against the Bengals. \nAt some point, the Ravens would probably be wise to increase touches for rookies like TE Maxx Williams and RB Buck Allen. But there’s no drastic move to be made that will spark what’s already a veteran team. Perhaps gambling with more blitzes – what’s to lose now? – and getting Jason Babin on the field more might help. Otherwise, the Ravens can only keep fighting, as they surely will, and hope their luck turns. Bell: Long a calling card, Ravens defense now their Achilles \nLORENZO REYES \nThe Ravens should consider changes, but not drastic ones. Any struggling NFL team should consider changes. But this coaching staff, after winning Super Bowl XLVII three years ago and making the playoffs last season, deserves some benefit of the doubt. The big problem Baltimore has is a leaky secondary that is allowing too many big plays. Not having pass rusher Terrell Suggs is a big part of that. \nCertainly, the offense – especially the running game – needs to be better, too. Justin Forsett gained just 13 rushing yards on 10 carries in last week’s loss against the Bengals. That’s not close to acceptable. The Ravens need to go back to their strengths, be balanced and protect the ball. They have enough talent, on paper at least, to get on the right track without making any disruptive changes. \nPHOTOS: Week 4 games ranked by watchability", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:46:09.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
