Mandatory Credit: Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports Texas Longhorns coach Charlie Strong is never going to acknowledge the depths to which the program had sunk when he was hired following the 2013 season. As recently as Monday during his weekly press conference, Strong reiterated that he will never blame Brown for the state of the team today.\nAdChoices The Longhorns are 1-4 and 0-2 in the Big 12 as they head into Saturday's Red River Rivalry game against No. 10 Oklahoma. Strong admitted Monday that the situation does \"look gloomy,\" but maintained his belief things will turn around.\nWhile Strong has no interest in belaboring a past that can't be undone, opposing coaches, provided anonymity by Sports Illustrated reporters Pete Thamel and Thayer Evans, vehemently defended Strong. The coaches crush Brown for not signing quality players in his latter years, and they blame the current upperclassmen for causing the rift with the younger players.\n\"Mack knew the s--- going on, he just didn't want to own up to it,\" a coach told SI. \"He knows what he left.\"\nAnother coach said: \"(University of Texas) kids have always been entitled. They've been given everything. They're usually four- and five-star recruits that don't feel like they have to work. They just thought they could show up.\"\nStrong came to Texas with his five core values and suspended or dismissed up to a dozen players last season. Texas finished 6-7. This season started with a 38-3 blowout at Notre Dame, an embarrassment that forced Strong to strip co-offensive coordinator Shawn Watson of his play-calling duties and bench starting quarterback Tyrone Swoopes in favor of redshirt freshman Jerrod Heard.\nA spark seemed to be lit as Texas then lost consecutive heartbreakers on special-teams errors against Cal and Oklahoma State. A 50-7 whipping at TCU last week sent the good vibes crashing. Player infighting dominated Monday's weekly press conference, a rift seemingly between the younger players and the older ones. Already off to the worst start for a Texas team since 1956, Strong is starting at a 1-5 start. The SI report says opposing coaches could sense the rift, and blame the upperclassmen for a lack of leadership and, in general, no longer caring.\n\"None of the older guys are going to the NFL, so you can tell most of them really don't care,\" one of the coaches told SI.\nAnother said: \"The upperclassmen are killing everything. The freshmen just want to play. They're balling their a---- off.\"\nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you? Sign up for our College Football newsletters.
