Seventeen cities or counties have gas taxes ranging from a penny to a nickel per gallon.\nNovick said he is optimistic about the gas tax after reviewing new polling results. The tax would raise far less money than the controversial street-fee proposal initially pushed by Novick and Mayor Charlie Hales in May 2014.\n\"I think the voters recognize the time to act is now,\" Novick said.\nNovick said he will ask the City Council to send the tax to voters in the May 17 election – the same time that Novick and Hales are seeking re-election.\nHales has already publicly pledged support. Commissioners Dan Saltzman and Nick Fish are likely to offer support, too, having previously said they wanted any funding decision to be made by voters.\nThe proposed tax would run four years, Novick said, with a citizen oversight board and periodic audits to monitor spending.\nOn Monday, Novick will discuss the recent poll results – funded by his re-election campaign – and will also unveil a list of potential safety and maintenance projects that could be funded by the tax.\n\"It's not a final list,\" he said. \"It's an example.\"\nEarlier this summer, it looked unlikely that the City Council would push for new transportation funding.\nHales and Novick put efforts on hiatus in January to see if the Legislature would approve new statewide funding. When that didn't happen, and lawmakers indicated they wouldn't try again until 2016 at the earliest, Hales offered no new local plan.\n\"We will wait, we will pave, and we will continue to have faith in our leaders in Salem,\" Hales said in a July statement .\nBut Novick kept pressing, talking to business leaders, trying to build support. And the City Club of Portland last month endorsed a gas tax as the first step in a broader funding strategy.\nAfter members of the City Council have \"done nothing\" to address the problem for nearly 30 years , Novick said, the gas tax would show voters that elected leaders are taking steps to fix Portland's crumbling roads.\n\"Doing something is much more preferable than continuing the past,\" he said.\n-- Brad Schmidt\nbschmidt@oregonian.com\n503-294-7628\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": ["http://www.oregon.gov/odot/cs/ftg/pages/current_ft_rates.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:32:57.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
