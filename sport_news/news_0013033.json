Hubener was banged up in last week's game against the Cowboys, forcing WR Kody Cook to play as the emergency fifth-string quarterback. When Cook got hurt, Hubener went back in and finished the game. He needs to remain healthy and play well for the Wildcats to have a shot, especially against a TCU defense that nearly shut out Texas a week ago. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nTCU: WR Josh Doctson ranks second nationally with 722 yards receiving and eight TD catches. His two TD catches against Texas gave him 23 in his career, breaking Josh Boyce's school record. \nKansas State: LB Elijah Lee leads the Wildcats in tackles. A defensive end in high school, he has helped to anchor a defense that is particularly stout against the run. Kansas State has only allowed 284 yards rushing in four games. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nTCU has a 13-game winning streak, second only to Ohio State's 18-game run. ...
