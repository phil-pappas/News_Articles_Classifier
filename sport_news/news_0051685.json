She smacked six in the 2-0 win over Dumont. \nBERGENFIELD - The Lady Bears listened to coach Will Jaeger during a Sunday morning practice and as a result they earned a straight sets victory (25-18, 25-16) over Dumont Oct. 5. \n\"Our communication was really good today,\" said senior libero Haleigh Martin. \"We had practice yesterday morning and I have to say our communication wasn't as great as it has been. It was only a Sunday morning [practice] but it was pretty down. We came out today and we needed a win and the communication is what did it for us.\" kevin j. riley/photo Senior libero Haleigh Martin passes the ball to a teammate. She had eight digs in the match. \n\"The main thing we needed to focus on in today's game was communication,\" added junior Aimee Sanchez. \"We knew they were a good team - it was a good matchup for us. Yesterday in practice that was our emphasis. The reason we were losing before was lack of communication.\" \nBergenfield trailed only once in the match, when Huskies junior outside hitter Kayla Cicero smacked a kill to give Dumont a 2-1 lead in the second set. Buy this photo kevin j. riley/photo Outside hitter Daniela Hoyos served two aces and had the game-winning kill for the Bears in the first set. She finished with four kills. \nMost-improved player \nThe first set was close with the two teams tied on two occasions. Martin broke an 8-8 tie with a kill and the Bears won the next three points on a Huskies attack error and back-to-back kills by Bergenfield senior Daniela Hoyos. kevin j. riley/photo Huskies sophomore middle Ariana Pena, No. 16, had four kills and a block for Dumont. \nDumont sophomore Ariana Pena halted the Bears mini run with a kill and later the Huskies came within one point, 12-13, on a kill by senior middle Carlie Mantone. \n\"Their middle (Pena) is pretty good,\" said Jaeger. \"She's tall - she has some length to her. You can't let her just hit open season. That's what I challenged Kaitlyn [Maitland] Alyssa [Nina], our two middles. We had to get blocks and we finally blocked a couple of balls in the second game.\" \n\"He (Jaeger) told us they were going to be a good match-up for us,\" said Martin. \"We're rival towns and I was expecting a good fight from them. We pulled through and I thought our defense was better than theirs.\" \nBergenfield retook the lead and won 10 of the next 13 points to pull away to 23-15. \nThree of those points were tallied by Sanchez, a newcomer to the varsity team. \n\"Aimee Sanchez was the most-improved player last year,\" said Bears coach Will Jaeger. \"We gave her an award as JV player. She's the leader in kills. She's come a long way. She had five kills in the first game.\" \n\"Aimee is doing great,\" said senior setter Kim Souffront. \"Last year she got most improved player and this year she has come a long way.\" \nThe Bears closed out the first set with kills by senior Paula Caucayo and Hoyos. \n\"[The chemistry] is really good,\" Sanchez said. \"A lot of these girls play other sports so I already knew them. We took the time in summer play to get used to each other and to the way we play and now we're doing really good as far as communication goes.\" \n\"The No. 1 thing we are working on is talking and in this game the talking really helped us finish,\" said Souffront. \"We knew when people were tipping, when it was going to be a hit, if it was in or out, whatever it was.\" \nDefense and offense \nDumont opened the second set with a service error but a blast by Mantone and Cicero's kill gave the Huskies that 2-1 advantage. \nBergenfield stormed back, building the lead to 10, 20-10, largely on attack errors by Dumont. The Bears defense was great at returning balls, which were turned into mistakes by the Huskies. \n\"We started the first game with an into-the-net ball and in the second game so did they,\" said Martin. \"We came back in the first game and were able to have our energy up. We won the first game and once their ball went into the net you could see their spirits go down.\" \n\"[The defense] is much better this season,\" said Jaeger. \"Haleigh (Martin) has been huge. We had a big hole to fill with Chelliah [Phillips] in the middle, a 6'1 girl blocking. Kaitlyn Maitland is a first-year varsity player and she got a block and a couple of tips today.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:53:31.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
