But I do think that he's going to have to have some time to practice it and develop there. But I also think he could play safety if he wanted to be a safety. But corners are, you know, a little more difficult to find. He's certainly been a good one for us so far.\" \nRELATED: Inside Minkah Fitzpatrick's rise from 'peanut butter room' to one of Alabama's top young players \nOne of the top-ranked members of the Tide's most recent recruiting class, Fitzpatrick has made one of the biggest immediate impacts any true freshman has made since Saban arrived at Alabama in 2007. \nFitzpatrick is tied for fifth on the team with 24 tackles. He has three stops for a loss, two sacks, a team-high six pass breakups among non-defensive linemen and two interceptions he returned for touchdowns. \nFitzpatrick also had a momentum-shifting play on special teams during Alabama's 38-10 win over No. 8 Georgia Oct. 3. \nWith the Tide leading just 10-3 with less than five minutes left in the second quarter, Fitzpatrick blocked a punt, recovered the ball and ran 1-yard for a touchdown. \nBoth of his pick-sixes came during Alabama's 41-23 win over No. 9 Texas A&M last week. \nHe became the first player in Tide history with two interception returns for touchdowns in the same game. \nWhile Fitzpatrick has strictly played Star in games, teammates such as wide receiver Richard Mullaney said they see the characteristics that will enable Fitzpatrick to have continued success once he focuses on cornerback. \n\"He's really smart out there,\" Mullaney said. \"I feel like that's one of his biggest things, how smart he is. He's really physical. Obviously he can run. Really, just how smart he is, reading the defense, reading the quarterback. That's one of the best things he's got.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:38:22.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
