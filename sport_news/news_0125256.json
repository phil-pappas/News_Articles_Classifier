I expect to get him involved in the game plan a little bit more, not only at tailback, but at fullback as well.” \nWalker broke a hand during Arkansas 16-12 loss to Toledo on Sept. 12 in Little Rock. The following Sept. 19 Saturday in a 35-24 loss to Texas Tech in Fayetteville, Razorbacks receiver Jared Cornelius broke an arm catching Arkansas’ first pass. \nCornelius began practicing on a non-contact basis last week but isn’t ready to play against Auburn, Bielema said Monday. \nJuan Day, the freshman running back from North Little Rock redshirted last in 2014 recovering from knee surgery from his high school senior year then re-injuring the knee during spring drills requiring yet another major surgery, has physically been cleared to play against Auburn after weathering full contact during scrimmages with the redshirts and seldom used reserves last week. \nWhile physically cleared, Day’s chances for a game debut appear more likely for the Oct. 31 homecoming nonconference game against Tennessee-Martin. Among the redshirting freshmen catching his eye during last week’s practices, Bielema cited offensive tackle Colton Jackson of Conway; tight ends Will Gragg of Dumas, Austin Cantrell of Roland, Okla. and C.J. O’Grady of Fayetteville; receiver Deon Stewart of Hardy Highland; defensive lineman T.J. Smith of Moultrie, Ga. and defensive back Nate Dalton of Baton Rouge, La. \n“I think Colton Jackson appears to be a kid who can help us sooner rather than later on the offensive line,” Bielema said. “Not this year, but he’ll be a guy we can plug in right away.” \nBielema wants play-calling coordinator Enos and quarterback Brandon Allen gearing the passing attack to the 80s. \nNot the decade, but junior tight ends Hunter Henry of Little Rock via Pulaski Academy, and Jeremy Sprinkle of White Hall wearing No. 84 and No. 83 and wideouts Morgan, No. 80 from Greenwood, and Reed, No. 87 out of Camden Fairview. \n“ I really hit Dan up on 84 and 83 can be a big part of our offense.,” Bielema said. “I think 80 and 87 can be a big part of it if you kind of give him (Reed) certain things he can do. He definitely does have speed. And what we’ve witnessed now for a couple of games in a row is when he’s got the ball in his hands he can make something happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:28:09.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
