Harvey is scheduled to start for NL East champion New York against postseason pro Jon Lester. \nBut while the series features two of the country's largest media markets — the city that never sleeps against the city of broad shoulders — this savory matchup was grown down on the farm the last few years, sprouting up off dusty minor league diamonds at Double-A Tennessee and Binghamton, Triple-A Iowa and Las Vegas. \nAs both franchises (and their loyal fans) endured half a decade of consistent losing, Epstein and Mets general manager Sandy Alderson were stockpiling prospects. \nChicago rebuilt around rookie sluggers, while New York pinned its plan on lively arms. \nAnd here they are in October, perhaps a year or so ahead of schedule. \nThe scouts saw it coming. \n\"The successful teams, whether they're big market, small market, large payroll, small payroll, you've got to develop your own players. That's the currency with which we deal,\" Alderson said. \"Ultimately if you don't develop your own players, you're going to come up short at some point, either on your own team or in the trade market.\" \nOne glance at the young studs on each team doesn't tell the entire story, though. \nChicago actually had a lower ERA than the Mets this year, while New York had more homers and a higher slugging percentage. So despite their obvious differences, this is not really some head-to-head clash of cultural baseball philosophies. \n\"We're not in it for the narrative. We're in it to go to the World Series,\" said Epstein, the Cubs' president of baseball operations. \nStill, everyone involved is acutely aware of all the young talent that will be on display. \n\"We've kind of ascended. The Mets showed their muscle the latter part of the year like we did,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"It's really kind of like a renaissance going on right now with the youth in baseball.\" \nMaddon and Mets skipper Terry Collins go back a long way. When he was hired to manage the Angels before the 1997 season, Collins chose Maddon to be his bench coach. And when Collins resigned in September 1999, Maddon took over the team on an interim basis. \nThis season, Maddon got the best of his old friend as the Cubs won all seven meetings between the teams by a combined score of 27-11. It was the first time the Mets were swept in a season series of seven games or more — and the first time Chicago did it since 1885 against the Buffalo Bisons. \nBut the last time they played was July 2, weeks before the Mets revamped a scuffling lineup. Since then, New York added Yoenis Cespedes and rookie Michael Conforto, among others, while Travis d'Arnaud and David Wright returned from injuries. Tyler Clippard and Addison Reed were acquired to deepen the bullpen. \n\"I think we all believe that we're a completely different team,\" Harvey said. \"I think we match up very well against them. I think we're excited to give them another run and have it be in this important of a series.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:58:11.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
