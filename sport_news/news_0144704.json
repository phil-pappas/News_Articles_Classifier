Analyzing possible manager candidates By David Brown \nNow that the Dodgers and Don Mattingly have decided they're not right for each other anymore, what will team brass do for a manager? They missed out on Joe Maddon this past offseason, as the timing of his availability from the Rays -- where he worked with Andrew Friedman -- wasn't ideal, and Maddon instead went to the Cubs. But now -- with the Mattingly divorce now official as CBS MLB Insider Jon Heyman reported earlier on Thursday -- Friedman, general manager Farhan Zaidi and team chairman Mark Walter have a chance to pick \"their guy\" to be skipper. \nHe doesn't have a lot of managerial experience, but Gabe Kapler, the team's director of player development, just might be the guy. Widely considered to be one of the brighter young minds in the game, Kapler was hired away from being a Fox Sports analyst in November to direct the organization's farm system. Kapler played in the majors for 12 seasons, including two with Tampa Bay when Friedman was GM, and he managed for a season in the minors for the Boston Red Sox. \nWho else? Other reported candidates include in-house possibilities such as bench coach Tim Wallach, who reportedly has interviewed for manager of the Nationals, and Ron Roenicke, the team's third-base coach. A former Dodgers player, Roenicke was manager of the Brewers from 2011 until May 4 before hooking on with L.A. \nThe best \"free-agent\" manager on the market probably is Bud Black, who managed the Padres from 2007 to June 15, when he was fired . \nCharlie Montoyo, who managed the Triple-A Durham Bulls (a Rays affiliate) for eight seasons before being promoted to the majors to coach third base in 2015, probably will get a look, having worked for Friedman. Another apprentice, Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez, has extensive coaching experience but none as a manager. He also was Joe Maddon's bench coach with the Rays. Phil Nevin, a former major league player with minor-league managerial experience, reportedly has interviewed with for the Marlins (twice), Padres, and Nationals openings. \nAnother candidate, directly from TV: Alex Cora, who works for ESPN, had an extensive playing career, and is widely respected in the industry, but has zero experience as a coach in the majors or minors. He has served as a manager/general manager for a winter league team in Puerto Rico . \nKapler would be a risk because he has never managed in a major-league dugout, but clubs have been bucking that trend in recent seasons. Kevin Cash with the Rays, Jeff Banister with the Rangers, Craig Counsell with the Brewers and Robin Ventura with the White Sox are among few examples. \nConsidered to have a strong personality with good communication skills, Kapler is said to have embraced analytics (which makes sense, given Friedman's and Zaidi's backgrounds). He recently turned 40 and, with his playing career having ended in 2010, probably could relate well to modern players (another reason, no doubt, why the Dodgers hired him for player development). \nKapler actually announced his retirement as a baseball player in late 2006 and immediately became a minor-league manager with the Greenville (S.C. Drive of the Class A South Atlantic League. Josh Reddick and Felix Doubront were among his players. Kapler lasted one season as a manager, going 58-81, before starting his playing career over. \nClockwise, from upper left to right: Martinez, Kapler, Wallach, Nevin, Montoyo, and Black.
