(Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post) \nFormer NBA player Glen Rice Jr., who was cut from the Washington Wizards in January, was shot in the leg on Sunday after a gunfight broke out at an upscale Atlanta eatery owned by the rapper T.I., Atlanta’s WTOC reports. \n[ Wizards wave Glen Rice Jr. ] \nThe ordeal reportedly began when Rice Jr., son of NBA great Glen Rice, got into a fight with four or five other people at Scales 925. After all the men involved were told to leave the premises, the fight spilled out into the parking lot, which is where Rice was shot, police say. \nRice Jr. attempted to flee the scene with a friend in a Porsche, but was caught by police after being taken to the hospital. Officers said they found a stolen revolver, as well as around $6,000 in cash and over half a pound of marijuana in a backpack in his possession. \nRice, who had been playing with the NBA D-League team the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, is facing charges of reckless conduct and possession of marijuana, according to WTOC. \nTMZ , which first reported the fight on Sunday, reminds this isn’t the first time Rice Jr. has been involved in a gun incident. In 2012, he was kicked off Georgia Tech’s basketball team after getting caught up with a man named Steven Pryor, who reportedly was driving the Porshe on Sunday. In the 2012 incident, Pryor had allegedly shot a 9mm pistol out of a Cadillac Escalade that Rice was driving while leaving an Atlanta nightclub.
