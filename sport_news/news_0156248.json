Among the factors questioned by the analyst, Economic & Planning Systems Inc., were the projected rate of inflation, growth in event attendance and the $1.1 billion project's indirect economic impact.\n\"We are very confident in our data,\" said Kelly Leid, executive director of the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative. \"Plain and simple.\"\nOfficials on Denver's bid for Regional Tourism Act funding say they provided support for their claims to the analyst. But the analyst stuck to its key findings in a presentation to the commission Monday after Mayor Michael Hancock and other supporters made the city's pitch.\nAdvertisement The commission Oct. 22 will convene a \"deep-dive workshop,\" giving Denver another chance to rebut the analyst's findings.\nThe panel is set to approve RTA applications Nov. 12 and could, under state law, allow an award as much as 1.5 times as high as the analyst's projection, or nearly as much as Denver is requesting. A Larimer County team also has applied for RTA money for tourism projects.\nDenver and its partners, including the Western Stock Show Association, are counting on RTA money as one of several big sources of funding. The National Western Center master plan calls for remaking 270 acres over the next decade or so into a year-round tourism, event, education and agricultural innovation center, with Colorado State University playing a big role .\nDenver voters will decide Nov. 3 whether to approve extensions of car rental and lodging taxes that would provide another $476 million.\nA key sticking point between the city and the RTA analyst is how many new visitors will attend events in the new buildings. The city projects 1.1 million new visitors, in part by lowering the baseline because of a projected 15 percent decline in stock show attendance in coming years when the state's Interstate 70 project and other roadwork gets underway nearby.\nThe analyst rejected that calculation, instead estimating attendance growth at 960,500.\nThe report also undercuts city estimates for new in-state visitors to the center. But Leid and others argue that events such as national equestrian shows will draw a large number of Coloradans who attend those shows out of state.", "external_links": ["http://www.advancecolorado.com/sites/default/files/143071-NWC%20Report_10-01-15.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-05T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:29:11.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
