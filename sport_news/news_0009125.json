The victory ended a four-game road trip to begin the season for the Jets.\nDespite being outshot 20-8 in the period, the Jets went into the second intermission with a 2-1 lead thanks to Little's short-handed goal at 18:49. Little, whose 52 points were third most on the Jets last season, one-timed a feed from Jacob Trouba.\nHis power play goal at 10:35 of the third period sealed the game for the Jets, who handed New York its first loss of the season.\nHenrik Lundqvist made 24 saves.\nMats Zuccarello scored New York's lone goal.\nThe Rangers actually led 1-0 when Zuccarello's third goal of the season opened the scoring 6:45 into the game. The sequence began with Rick Nash harassing Blake Wheeler into an offensive zone turnover. Nash dumped it to Derick Brassard, who quickly found an uncovered Zuccarello.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:00:30.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
