(Photo: USATSI) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJust so you know: we're not showing you the tweets from the human manure sacks that threatened and insulted Michigan punter Blake O'Neill in the wake of the Wolverines' loss to Michigan State on Saturday. Sacks of manure posing as people don't deserve the attention. \nBut they're out there, and Michigan athletic director Jim Hackett forcefully condemned them in an open letter sent to the Michigan community Sunday morning after reports of the manure-sack tweets began circulating. \n\"Today I awake to the shocking reality that our community who cares so much about this program would send hurtful, spiteful and vicious comments to one of our students,\" Hackett wrote. \"To be clear, such comments come from a small minority, none of whom are reflective of our institution. \n\"The program I know at MICHIGAN speaks about the team, the team the team. The people I have been associated with my whole life around this fantastic program - some whom are living and some whom have passed on - would never, I repeat never, spread blame ... I'm asking that our community not lose this game twice by condoning thoughtless comments and remember the Fielding Yost comment that this is the 'Michigan of ours.'\" \nIf you spent your Saturday inside a moon cave, O'Neill had only to boot the ball away on the game's final play for Michigan to beat Michigan State for the first time since 2012. But he fumbled the snap, and in a play that's going to air on highlight shows until even moon caves have satellite TV , the Spartans returned it for the game-winning touchdown. \nAnd one day, someone on your favorite team will make a soul-crushing error that lives on in moon cave infamy, too. When that happens, whether you're a Michigan fan or not, it'll be a good idea to listen to Hackett's advice -- and pass on turning yourself into another Tweeting manure sack. \nThe full text of Hackett's letter: Dear Michigan family, This Saturday's game continued to prove the progress that we are making in our football program. \nThis isn't only the way I feel the morning after a sudden change of euphoria took us to a heartbreaking loss. I know that many feel this â€“ we are proud of our kids. \nI know that all of our friends believe in what they saw for nearly 60 minutes of that game. This team left nothing on the field but its best effort. \nThe quality of Michigan football filled the chilled air. \nToday I awake to the shocking reality that our community who care so much about this program would send hurtful, spiteful and vicious comments to one of our students. To be clear, such comments come from a small minority, none of whom are reflective of our institution. \nThe program I know at MICHIGAN speaks about the team, the team the team. The people I have been associated with my whole life around this fantastic program - some whom are living and some whom have passed on - would never, I repeat never, spread blame. \nAs our head coach said yesterday, \"...this outcome will steel our spine.\" \nThat means all of us. \nI'm asking that our community not lose this game twice by condoning thoughtless comments and remember the Fielding Yost comment that this is the \"Michigan of ours.\" \nGo Blue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:08:06.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
