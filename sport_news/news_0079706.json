While most communist relics will be removed or destroyed, this particular Lenin statue has been repurposed.\n\"The bronze Lenin was left inside, so that the grateful or not-so-grateful descendants could exhume him, if needed,\" Milov is Quote: d as saying by Ukraine Today .\nLocal website Dumskaya shared photos of the newly erected art piece, which now sports black paint and a WiFi-emitting Vader helmet. Fans dressed as storm troopers and Vader attended the monument's opening ceremony on Friday.\nThe sculptor hopes that \"Star Wars\" devotees will flock to the monument and boost Odessa's tourism. Based on the recent advanced ticket sales data for \"The Force Awakens,\" perhaps Milov should focus on targeting adult males around age 34.\n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" bows in theaters Dec. 18, 2015.
