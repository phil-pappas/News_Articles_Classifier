The internet sensation was at Powell's Books at Cedar Hills Crossing Wednesday night, promoting her new book \"Grumpy Cat: No-It-All.\"\nShe slept through most of it, doing as cats do, hardly bothered to be at anyone's beck and call. The occasional rude interruption from a TV news station or newspaper photographer garnered a meme-inducing signature frown.\nGrumpy Cat visits Powell's Books in Beaverton Grumpy Cat promotes \"Grumpy Cat: No-It-All: Everything You Need to No\" at 7 p.m., Wed Oct. 14, 2015. Powell's Books at Cedar Hills Crossing, Beaverton, OR\nAbout 430 people and their family members showed no trace of grump though, as they waited for their photo opp with the napping three-year-old calico/gray tabby mix from Phoenix, Arizona. She was born with dwarfism and an unpredictably cute overbite.\n\"She's really super calm, docile,\" says Bryan Bundesen, Grumpy Cat's uncle. \"She's a sweetheart.\"\nBundesen's sister Tabatha is the owner of Tardar Sauce, as the famous feline is known around her house. Truth be told, Tardar's brother Pokey is the resident grouch.\nTardar travels maybe a couple times a month, sometimes to glamorous locales like Toronto or New York, where she was on the \"Today\" show.
