After backup Bart Houston entered for a snap, Stave was cleared to return and played part of the next series before being relieved for the rest of the game by Houston. \nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. — After nearly playing a week ago against Purdue,   running back Corey Clement did not even travel to Illinois for the Badgers’ 24-13 win over the Fighting Illini on Saturday. \nClement, who underwent sports hernia surgery more than three weeks ago, was cleared before last week’s game. He warmed up in full pads against the Boilermakers before opting not to play. \nHe went through multiple contact practices this week but decided after Thursday’s practice not to travel with the team to Champaign. \n“He knew he wasn’t going to be able to play, so he figured he would not even take the trip,” said running back Dare Ogunbowale, who has started after the injuries to Clement and redshirt freshman Taiwan Deal. “Only he’ll know how he’s feeling. Corey’s an explosive player, so I wasn’t surprised to see how fast he was going (in practice), but I really don’t know how he was feeling.” \nOgunbowale and true freshman Alec Ingold combined for 68 rushing yards on 29 carries against Illinois, an average of 2.3 yards per rush. Stave cleared, then sits \nJoel Stave exited Saturday’s game with a head injury after being sacked on the Badgers’ second drive. \nHe came back in on the next series but was replaced by Bart Houston after six plays and did not return. UW coach Paul Chryst said Stave was cleared by the training staff before re-entering the game. \n“He went out and doctors went through the protocol,” Chryst said. “He went back in for that one drive. You could tell, the way he wasn’t getting the plays, (we) thought, ‘You know what, you just don’t know.’ He was cleared but we thought Bart was going to be our best chance on it.” True two-way role \nWhen wide receiver Robert Wheelwright left the game in the third quarter with a left leg injury, Tanner McEvoy took over a prominent role at wide receiver for the first time since early this season. \nMcEvoy has started at safety since Week 2 and saw his snaps at wide receiver significantly decrease when Big Ten play began. \nAfter Wheelwright exited, McEvoy caught an 11-yard pass for a first down, took a snap as a wildcat quarterback and maintained his every-snap role on defense. \n“When people get injured, people have to step up,” McEvoy said. “I had an opportunity in that second half to go out there and play some offense. \n“(Playing that many snaps) is like playing ball back at home with your friends, like playing pickup football or seven-on-seven with some guys. It’s just fun getting out there, going on both sides of the ball and helping the team win.” Wind strategy \nThe wind swirling from North to South at Memorial Stadium didn’t affect the kicking game as much as it did in the Badgers’ win over Nebraska two weeks earlier. \nIt did, however, affect how UW’s defense prepared for each series. \n“The wind was really gusting in one direction,” outside linebacker Joe Schobert said. “We really put that in the back of our mind, knowing that they wouldn’t take many deep shots going that way on the field and playing against the things that you know are going to come because of that. \n“On the flip side, when they do have the wind, you know that they could take shots.” \nIllinois completed passes of 37, 29 and 31 yards when going with the wind in the second and fourth quarters. Extra points \nChryst did not reveal the severity of injuries for Stave, Wheelwright or center Dan Voltz, who left in the third quarter with a right leg injury. … Redshirt freshman D.J. Gillins, who moved from quarterback to wide receiver last week, saw snaps on the punt return team against Illinois.
