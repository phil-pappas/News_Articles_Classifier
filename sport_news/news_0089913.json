No. 22 Temple finally cracked the top 25 because of its defense and its ground game. Some timely passing will help the Owls stay there.\nP.J. Walker threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Robby Anderson, and Temple scored 14 points Thursday night in the fourth quarter to rally past East Carolina 24-14.\nWalker finished 19 of 35 for 250 yards for the Owls (7-0, 4-0 American Athletic Conference). Anderson caught eight passes for 126 yards, with five of those grabs coming in the fourth quarter.\n\"We just haven't thrown it a ton,\" coach Matt Rhule said. \"We needed to throw it. They were taking away the run.... We took (Anderson) off the return duties and just said, 'Go concentrate on being a great receiver.' \"\nThe Owls ensured their first appearance in national rankings since 1979, and the best start in school history, will last a little longer - at least until No. 11 Notre Dame visits next Saturday night.\n\"I told my team in there, 'We're all going through this for the first time,' \" Rhule said. \"I'm going through this for the first time. So we're all making mistakes. But we all love each other, we're battling, and guys made plays.\"\nEast Carolina's Blake Kemp was 31 of 48 for 272 yards with a 7-yard TD pass to Quay Johnson. Chris Hairston added a 1-yard scoring run for the Pirates (4-4, 2-2).\n\"They've got to know we've got a lot of season left,\" coach Ruffin McNeill said. \"Temple did a lot of good things tonight. We didn't. We didn't do things that we've got to do to win the game.\"\nTemple's Jahad Thomas ran for touchdowns from 2 and 14 yards, the last sealing it with 2:18 to play. The American's leading rusher finished with just 66 yards - 60 fewer than his average.\nThe Owls gained 82 total yards while going scoreless on their first five possessions of the second half, before the passing game got hot.\nWalker hit Anderson over the middle for 51 yards to the East Carolina 34 with about 5-1/2 minutes to go. Five plays later, they hooked up again, with Anderson slipping past a defender between the hash marks on his way across the goal line with 3:31 remaining.\n\"We've got guys that are not afraid to go across the middle and make a big play for us,\" Walker said.\nAfter Temple forced a three-and-out, Sharif Finch blocked Worth Gregory's punt at the East Carolina 15. Two plays later, Thomas iced it.\nThe Owls forced two second-half turnovers and blocked two punts while East Carolina finished with nine penalties for 99 yards and lost to Temple for the second straight year. The Pirates had five turnovers in a 20-10 loss in Philadelphia last season that knocked them from the top 25.\nThey were about 5 minutes from getting payback on Temple, one of three nationally ranked teams from the American.\nThe Pirates came in as 2-1/2-point favorites and led 14-10 after a back-and-forth final 10 minutes of the first half, when the lead changed hands on three straight possessions.\nRelated U.Va. freshman linebacker Eric Gallon will start vs. UNC - Oct. 22, 2015 With ESPN GameDay at JMU, banner touting move to FBS will fly - Oct. 22, 2015 ECU to put Temple's new ranking to the test tonight - Oct. 22, 2015 With hand injuries, Virginia Tech's Dadi Nicolas just wants to get a grip - Oct. 22, 2015 NSU report | With MEAC up for grabs, Spartans use extra time to work on ailing offense - Oct. 21, 2015 Posted to : College Football College Football Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:46:22.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
