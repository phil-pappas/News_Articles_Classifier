Forward lines and defense combinations were changed. New uniforms featuring a familiar logo made their way into the spotlight. And the Ducks still can’t score.\nThis reconstituted group continues have all sorts of issues getting the puck past the goal line. The winless Ducks remained so Friday night as the Colorado Avalanche took advantage of their struggles, picking up a 3-0 victory at Honda Center.\nThe Ducks (0-3-1) have scored one goal in 245 minutes of regulation and overtime play. The one goal came from defenseman Sami Vatanen at 1:56 of the second period in Monday’s home opener against Vancouver. Their scoreless streak now sits at 163 minutes, 4 seconds.\n“It’s something we really haven’t gone through, at least since I’ve been here,” winger Corey Perry said. “It’s tough. We did a lot of good things, but it’s those second opportunities. You have to give credit to them. They blocked a lot of shots.\n“It’s going to break and when it does, it’s going to feel good.”\nThe conditions appeared to be right for the punchless Ducks to finally break loose. Colorado came into town carrying a 6-2 home thrashing by Boston that had Avalanche coach Patrick Roy ripping his team’s effort.\nAnd then Roy opted to sit struggling goalie Semyon Varlamov in favor of little-used backup Reto Berra. Berra carried with him career numbers – 2.91 goals-against average, .901 save percentage – that wouldn’t make him a No. 1 option on any team.\nFacing the offensively impotent Ducks proved highly beneficial in his case. Berra stopped all 35 shots he faced for his second career shutout, with Nathan MacKinnon and Jack Skille backing his effort with goals. John Mitchell added an empty-net score in the final minute.\nThe Ducks were much more active all over the ice than their listless effort Wednesday against Arizona and they shot the puck early and often. Those pucks that were on target found Berra each and every time. Rebounds left behind were either missed or not reached in time.\n“I think from beginning to end, there was no quit,” Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said. “Obviously, it’s pretty disappointing for everybody. The fans, the players. There’s nobody in this organization that’s happy right now.\n“I did see signs that they’re pulling out of it. I firmly believe if we get one goal, we’ll get three or four. Right now, it’s just such a struggle to score.”\nEven the debut of their orange-colored alternate jersey with the original Mighty Ducks logo incorporated into the scheme didn’t change their fortunes. Boudreau jumbled his lines, shuffling his wingers around and putting in grinders Chris Wagner and Tim Jackman.\nIt only got worse, with defenseman Simon Despres not returning to the game in the third period because of an upper-body injury. Ducks goalie Frederik Andersen made 23 saves in defeat.\n“I think anytime you only score one goal in four games, it’s a concern,” Hagelin said. “But at the same time, we understand what we got to do. We can’t get too frustrated. We can’t get too down.\n“We got to get out there next game (against Minnesota) and make it count. Be as good as we can.”\nAvalanche defenseman Francois Beauchemin was playing his first game in Anaheim since leaving the Ducks as a free agent this summer. Beauchemin signed a three-year, $13.5 million contract with Colorado after the Ducks only offered two years during negotiations.\nThe Ducks flashed an image of Beauchemin on the scoreboard, which drew a large ovation for the former alternate captain.\n“It was fun,” Beauchemin said. “It was exciting. Obviously, it’s always a little special to come back here and play in that building and this city. The fans had a nice ovation for me there.”\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:08:44.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
