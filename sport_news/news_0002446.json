He said he had sex with her because he thought she was unconscious, but when he realized she was dead, he buried her.\nThe news is sad relief for Carrie Ann's mother, Caroyln Tousignant.\n\"He said he did it. He admitted it finally after how long? Thirty-three years,\" Tousignant said.\nTousignant said the day Carrie Ann went missing, she got a call from her school saying Carrie Ann had been suspended for skipping class.\n\"I figured she'll be home, but she never showed up,\" Tousignant said.\nA year later, a contractor was working on a porch across the street from her home when he discovered a girl's body in the dirt.\nTousignant stood by as police unearthed her daughter.\n\"She's in God's hands right now. No more worrying where she is,\" Tousignant said.\nTousignant said she knows the man who called in as Junior.\n\"Oh, my God. He always said that she was haunting him,\" Tousignant said.\nThe man is now 50 years old and once told her he and some friends were with Carrie Ann when she hit her head and died. But he wouldn't tell police.\n\"They were drinking, they were all drinking Yukon Jack and smoking weed. They got scared, so they grabbed a dry cleaning bag, wrapped her up in that and dug a hole under the porch and buried her,\" Tousignant said.\n12 News contacted police after the man's call but aren't naming him because he hasn't been charged. However, police confirmed the man is in custody on the preliminary charge of homicide.\nCopyright 2015 WISN, family photos and CNN.
