For us to still be in the game lets me know my team is still playing good football, just not good mental football.”\nTied at 14 after four quarters, Dorchester (5-0) got the ball first in overtime and scored on Ki Harris’ 5-yard TD run. O’Bryant stopped the two-point try, but could not answer Dorchester’s score on its possession.\nNot only did the Bears get the key defensive stop in OT, but it was that unit that kept them in the game, according to Brown.\n“Offensively, we made a lot of silly mistakes,” Brown said. “But defensively — the entire game — these guys kept this unbelievable offense to only six points until some fluky pass play (that led to) them tying it up.”\nDorchester turned the ball over twice in the first half, but O’Bryant (3-2) failed to capitalize on either turnover. The lone first-half score came on the Tigers’ first possession, as senior Aaron Dowell capped a nine-play, 66-yard drive with a 9-yard rushing touchdown on fourth down. Junior quarterback Kobe Smith started the play with a long backward pass to Dowell.\nThe Bears found some life in the third quarter after sophomore Jaron Harrison recovered a fumble by Montal Phillip at the Tigers 12. Five plays later, junior QB Stephen Jacques found paydirt from 1 yard out to knot the score 6-6.\nAfter forcing O’Bryant to punt, Dorchester marched down the field on a five-play, 67-yard drive that included 50 rushing yards by Harris on two attempts. Senior Theodore Campbell ended the trek with a 5-yard touchdown run up the middle. Harris added a two-point rush and the Bears owned a 14-6 edge early in the fourth quarter.\nThe Tigers tied it back up with 3:15 to go on an eight-play drive that amassed 66 yards. The big play came on a third-and-10 from their own 45 as Smith found Emmanuel Exilhomme down the middle for a 53-yard gain to the Dorchester 2. Two plays later, Phillip (115 yards) ran up the middle to score and Smith’s two-point run tied the game at 14-14.\nSmith picked off Jacques with less than 30 seconds left in the contest to force overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:49:33.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
