What has become evident now — as opposed to 2012 when Khan made the initial four-year commitment (2013-16) to play one home game in London — is the Jaguars desperately need the financial dividend the NFL offers them by going to Wembley Stadium once a year. \nWith Jacksonville ranked near the bottom among 32 NFL teams in local revenue, the approximate $10-12 million (plus a percentage of corporate sponsorship) the Jaguars receive for taking Sunday’s matchup with the Buffalo Bills across the Atlantic is an economic boost that Khan can’t turn down. \nIt levels the playing field and, as an added bonus, it creates a business relationship with a leading international financial market that should benefit the Jacksonville economy in the coming years. \nSo with the NFL willing to extend the Jaguars-London agreement through 2020 , with a league option for another five years, Khan formally announced that badly-kept secret Thursday. Of course, the Jaguars are going to continue an arrangement that doubles the normal payout for one game at EverBank Field. \nAnd if playing in the UK extends to a second game at some point — providing the Jaguars are the road team and it’s done in back-to-back weeks — who could argue that somebody else (Indianapolis Colts/Houston Texans?) sacrificing their home game is a bad thing for Khan’s franchise? \nNow as for the football course Khan plans on continuing to follow — endorsing the maligned Caldwell/Bradley regime Thursday by telling the Times-Union he has a “huge amount of confidence” in them —that part will be viewed by Jaguars fans as either being sensible or totally misguided. \nWhile there’s little upside to Khan making a midseason change on his coach, he can’t ignore Bradley’s 8-30 record or that GM Caldwell is playing to mixed reviews in terms of talent acquisition. There are draft hits (Allen Robinson, Allen Hurns, Brandon Linder), shaky-looking picks (Luke Joeckel, Marqise Lee), free agent misses (Toby Gerhart, Ziggy Hood) and a ton of wait-and-sees. \nIt’s a stretch to think Khan would publicly put his coach and GM on notice in Week 7 during their third year of a massive rebuilding situation. For now, he has to support them, but that should be subject to change if things aren’t any better by Christmas. \nThe Jaguars can start to diminish the fan outrage by taking advantage of the medically-challenged Bills and winning on Sunday. If they can’t beat Buffalo, which has practically their entire core of offensive skill players sidelined, who can they beat? \nFans have no reason to doubt the Jaguars’ London initiative. It’s a sound business strategy. As for Khan’s leap of faith in standing by the football plan mapped out by Caldwell and Bradley, that’s a lot more iffy. \nThe turnaround Khan is expecting must bear some kind of fruit in 2015, not next year or the year after. Fans pleading for signs of significant improvement have waited long enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:18:40.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
