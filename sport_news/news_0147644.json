But the 21-year-old said it was exhaustion, not injury, that made her pull out. \n“It’s a sad day I had to retire. Sometimes your body’s not recovered,” the 21-year-old said on court after the match. \nMuguruza called her coach Sam Sumyk — who was wearing a T-shirt bearing the phrase “It’s not my fault” — on court during the first set but no words of advice could change the slow pace of the match. \nWilliams, who turned pro the year that Muguruza was born, was also struggling during the final, with leg pain, and had both of her thighs wrapped. \nShe had a gruelling semi-final the day before against her sister Serena’s nemesis Roberta Vinci, and conceded that she would have had a tough match against Muguruza if her young opponent had been on form. \n“I probably wouldn’t have had many chances if you had been feeling well,” Venus said in an on-court interview. \nThe title win will put Williams back in the top 20 when the new rankings are released on Monday, after entering Wuhan as number 23. \nThe former world number one was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease in 2011, and while she continued to play some tournaments, she has struggled with her health and slipped down the rankings. \nWilliams could now qualify for the season-ending WTA championships in Singapore, which she has not reached since 2009. \nMuguruza will also achieve a career high of five in the world rankings after making the finals at Wuhan, and will likely qualify for Singapore, barring any major upsets in next week’s China Open in Beijing. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:26:38.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
