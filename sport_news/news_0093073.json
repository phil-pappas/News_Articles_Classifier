On Wednesday morning, something did. Todd Richards is out as the team’s head coach after three seasons, replaced by professional lightning rod John Tortorella. Tortorella will make his debut on Thursday night in Minnesota when the winless Blue Jackets take on the Wild .\nRichards became the first coaching casualty of the season after the Jackets put forth another listless effort against the Islanders on Tuesday night.
