Roswell’s defensive line is considered one of the best in the state. Because of the competitiveness of the Hornet’s d-line, Lamar said he was able to play at his fullest. \n“It felt great,” Lamar said. “My defensive line was doing their job. Blocks weren’t getting to me like I thought they would. The play just showed itself so I went and got it.” \nRoswell hasn’t appeared in a state championship since 2006, when the Hornets faced Peachtree Ridge in a game that ended in a 14-14 tie. Expectations are high midway through the season, but the 6-3, 230 pound linebacker is hopeful for a shot at the 6A title. \n“I feel like the expectation for this season, for all the players and the coaches, is different than it was in prior seasons,” he said. “The team is really striving to reach that goal so I feel like it’s just a different expectation.” \nRoswell starts the season with six wins under their belt, and Lamar says more is to come. \n“I think we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing,” Lamar said. “I feel each week we’re going to get better. The next week you see Roswell will be better than the last.” \nWith his team by his side, Lamar says he’s honored to be named Athlete of the Week. \n“It’s incredible,” he said. “The poster is really nice and having the whole team see, it was crazy. But the team’s been doing some really good things. So just being able to do good things with the team has been awesome.” 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.11alive.com/1RwFa4E TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:38:06.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
