LONDON – Ryan Fitzpatrick gave everyone criticizing his arm strength a metaphorical middle finger on the Jets’ first play from scrimmage in a 27-14 win over the Dolphins Sunday.\nFitzpatrick’s 58-yard bomb to Brandon Marshall set up the first score and let Miami know that they weren’t going to tip-toe into this divisional game.\n“It just set the tone for the game for the team,” said Fitzpatrick, who went 16 for 29 for 218 yards, 1 TD and 1 INT. “We wanted to come out and be aggressive. That was what we preached all week. That’s what Todd said in the locker room… We came out right away and gave our best player a chance to make a play.”\nChan Gailey dialed up a double-go route with Marshall and Devin Smith. Fitzpatrick went to Marshall, who beat Dolphins top cornerback Brent Grimes.\n“We wanted to come out aggressive,” Fitzpatrick said. “We feel like (Marshall) is better than anyone he’s going against and just give him a chance on that one to make a play. He came down with it. It was a good start to the game.”\nFitzpatrick, who had struggled with the deep ball in the first three games, said that he didn’t get any additional satisfaction by sticking to his critics. “I get satisfaction out of winning,” Fitzpatrick said. “I don’t’ really care about that stuff.”\nHe also channeled his inner Mike Vick by using his legs on a few nifty scrambles. He finished with 34 yards on nine attempts, but got some advice from Todd Bowles, who doesn’t exactly want the veteran running. “I told him that he better learn how to slide,” Bowles said.\n“I don’t think we’re going to live and die by the scramble by me,” Fitzpatrick said. “I tried to slide, but usually if I’m close to the (first-down) marker—the high school quarterback takes over in me.”\nBANGED UP DEFENSE\nBowles’ defense suffered relatively minor injuries to three starters in the fourth quarter.\nCalvin Pryor suffered a bruised knee after banging knees with Jordan Cameron. A couple plays later David Harris left with a quad injury, but said he later said that he would be fine. Leonard Williams sprained his ankle.\nRunning back Bilal didn’t return after suffering a groin injury in the first half.\nDon’t expect any of them to practice Tuesday before the team takes the rest of the week off during the bye.\nTOO MANY FLAGS\nFor all the feel-good vibes, Bowles clearly wasn’t pleased with the season-high 14 penalties for 163 yards. The Jets practically gift-wrapped Miami’s first touchdown with a back-to-back pass interference penalties on Darrelle Revis and Marcus Gilchrist totaling 58 yards.\n“This is the new NFL,” Brandon Marshall said. “We’re on record pace (with) how many flags have been thrown. Players have to be smart… and not get frustrated when the calls don’t go their way.”\nJETS TURN UP THE HEAT\nBowles’ was in ultra-aggressive mode against Miami’s shaky offensive line. The Jets blitzed on 35 of Tannehill’s 48 drop backs (73 percent), according to ESPN Stats & Information, the most by any team in any game this season. Bowles also blitzed defensive backs an eye-opening 22 times, the most by any team in five years. The Jets defense has had 18 consecutive third-down stops dating back to last week.\n“Was it flawless? No,” outside linebacker Calvin Pace said of the defensive performance against Miami. “But was it a good performance? Yes. I think everybody’s happy with it.”\nDECKER'S RETURN\nEric Decker finished with 4 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown after missing last week’s game with a sprained knee.\nMARSHALL HITS CENTURY MARK AGAIN\nBrandon Marshall (7 receptions for 128 yards) became the first Jet since Al Toon in 1988 to have three consecutive 100-yard receiving games.\nRICHRDSON'S SUSPENSION UP\nThe Jets expect to have Sheldon Richardson back after serving a four-game suspension for violating the league’s substance abuse policy. Although the Pro Bowl defensive lineman has an unresolved legal matter stemming from his speeding and resisting arrest incident this offseason, the team has not yet made aware of any additional punishment. It’s possible the Richardson could miss games later this season or in 2016.\nEXTRA POINTS\nOutside linebacker Trevor Reilly (finger infection) made a seemingly miraculous recovery from a finger infection that kept him out of last week’s loss to Philly... Mo Wilkerson had two sacks... WR Chris Owusu, CB Darrin Walls, LB Jamari Lattimore, OL Jarvis Harrison, OL Willie Colon, OL Ben Ijalana and TE Jeff Cumberland were inactive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:08:56.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
