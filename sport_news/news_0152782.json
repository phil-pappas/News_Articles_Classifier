Stone/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 10:00 PM HOPKINTON — The Hopkinton girls volleyball team took care of some important business on Wednesday night. The Tri-Valley League-leading Hillers entered a matchup with second-place Medway looking to keep possession of that top spot. And not only did the Hillers keep it, but it took just 59 minutes to dispose of the Mustangs. With a 3-0 sweep of Medway on Wednesday night (25-14, 25-13, 25-15), the Hillers moved to 8-2 overall and 8-0 in TVL play. It was the sixth sweep of the season for the Hillers. Meanwhile, it was a tough night for a Medway team hoping to take first place from Hopkinton. Instead, the Mustangs fell to 7-2 overall and 7-2 in league play. \"It's always interesting playing Medway,\" Hopkinton coach Margie Grabmeier said. \"A lot of the girls play club in the offseason with the girls on the Medway team, and their coach coaches some of my girls as well, so there's always that angle to it. When you add the fact that they were right behind us in the standings, this was a big night for us and the girls really responded to the challenge.\" After the first game opened with the teams in a 5-5 stalemate, the Hillers eventually took an 11-9 lead thanks to a flurry of errors from Medway. Up 14-10, a strong block from Hopkinton junior Annie Dumas made it 15-10. The Hillers cruised from there, going on a 10-4 run to close out the game and take the 1-0 advantage. The second game turned into the Abbie Gilbert show for Hopkinton. With the score again tied at five, the senior accounted for 10 straight service points — including four aces — to put Hopkinton up 15-5. She finished with 16 service points on the night to go along with seven aces. The Hillers pushed the lead to 20-10, and minutes later a combined block from Dumas and sophomore Amanda Gilbert (7 blocks, 2 kills) ended Game 2 at 25-13 and set the Hillers up for yet another sweep. \"One of our goals this year is to follow in the footsteps of the team last year and the year before, and we couldn't do that if we didn't beat Medway,\" said Abbie Gilbert. \"We played a really fundamentally sound match tonight. It seemed like everyone was on the same page, and if something small went wrong it was quickly forgotten about and we just refocused our energy on getting the W.\" Led in large part by sophomore Rachel Zale (12 assists, 1 kill) setting up her teammates, Hopkinton completed the sweep. Leading 5-4 early, Zale set up Dumas for a kill to go up 6-4. Thanks to some Mustang errors, the Hillers then pushed the lead to 13-7. Medway, to its credit, refused to quit, and a kill from senior Sarah Lemmier cut the Hopkinton lead to 15-12. The Hillers, however, made sure there wouldn't even be a thought of a fourth game, going on 10-3 run that ended with a thunderous kill from junior Mikayla Pucci. Page 2 of 2 - \"We were ready to go right from the start tonight,\" said Hopkinton senior co-captain Jen Manning. \"Obviously we knew Medway was right behind us and we knew we had to take care of business. We knew they were trying to become that next force in the Tri-Valley so we sort of felt like we still had something to prove, that we weren't going to give that spot up yet. “They always provide great competition for us, so we knew we would have to start fast and finish whenever we could, and we did a good job of that tonight.\" With six sweeps in their eight wins, Grabmeier said her team has been able to take advantage of momentum. \"Volleyball is very momentum-oriented,\" she said. \"When you get up that 2-0 score, you can sense when a team is down. Our girls have been good at having that killer instinct, and hopefully they can keep maintaining it. “We're not at the level we need to be, but this was a big win.\" By Kevin J.
