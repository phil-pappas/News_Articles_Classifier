Here's what Sunday looks like. \nMANCHESTER UNITED V MANCHESTER CITY (13:05) \nManchester United winger Ashley Young is back in training but not fit enough to play the Manchester derby, while City are without Sergio Aguero, David Silva, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Fabian Delph due to injuries. \nUnited come into the game after a disappointing 1-1 draw against CSKA Moscow in the Champions League during their trip to the Far East. The Russian outfit opened the score from a rebound of a penalty shot saved by David de Gea. \nAnthony Martial scored a brilliant header in the second half to level the score. However, Louis van Gaal's side were not able to find the second goal and had to settle for the draw, despite dominating the match with possession. \nWhat managers say \nLouis van Gaal: \"When you look at the facts they are first and we are third. There's a goal difference, a point difference, and they are first so they are the favourite, I think.\" \nManuel Pellegrini: \"I don't have any problem with Vincent Kompany. I need, every week, to choose the 11 that I think is the best for that game and when the others play they must wait. It's crucial to play with the best players for the moment. Mangala and Otamendi are doing well.\" \nTeam Form \nLast Five (all competitions): D W L W W Last Result: CSKA Moscow 1-1 Manchester United Manchester City \nLast Five (all competitions): W W W W L Last Result: Manchester City 2-1 Sevilla \nBOURNEMOUTH V TOTTENHAM (13:05) \nTottenham striker Harry Kane should return to the starting line-up for their Premier League trip to Bournemouth, while Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe is still waiting to assess the full extent of goalkeeper Artur Boruc's thigh injury. \nLIVERPOOL V SOUTHAMPTON (15:15) \nLiverpool striker Daniel Sturridge remains a doubt for Sunday's visit of Southampton after undergoing an ultrasound scan on a troublesome knee, while Southampton's similarly injury-ravaged Jay Rodriguez could also miss out due to pain in his feet. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
