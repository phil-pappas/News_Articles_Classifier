In an ongoing Test match against England, Younis Khan has surpassed Miandad to become the highest Pakistani scorer. He trails Javed Miandad’s tally of 8832 runs in 124 matches, scored in the course of a superstar career. Before performing against England, Younis Khan said in a media interview, “It would be great to achieve the record. I never thought I would do it at the start of my career”. “Passing Miandad would be great, but I am in no way close to the great man who is a legend of Pakistan cricket. Even after passing his tally of runs I would not be able to attain the heights that Miandad achieved. He was idolised by millions,” he added. It’s England vs. Pakistan at Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi. Pakistan has scored 252 runs in the loss of 2 wickets. England is yet to bat.
