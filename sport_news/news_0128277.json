It's time to grade those moves.\nBelow are each of his 10 acquisitions, as well as polls to vote in.\n10. Signing free agent linebacker Andrew Gachkar to a two-year deal in March Machota: \"The former Charger has steadily moved up the depth chart to where he's been receiving first-team reps. The valuable special teams contributor is expected to help out at MIKE and SAM linebacker spots. With Anthony Hitchens nursing a foot injury and Rolando McClain suspended the first four games, Gachkar could prove to be very valuable in the middle.\"\nHow would you grade Andrew Gachkar's performance so far?\n9. Re-signing Rolando McClain Machota: \"Keeping McClain for another year could prove to be beneficial down the stretch. When McClain was playing well last season, the Dallas defense was clearly at its best. That leaves many to wonder: what could that group look like with McClain lining up alongside a healthy Sean Lee and defensive upgrades like Greg Hardy, Byron Jones and Randy Gregory?\"\nHow would you grade Rolando McClain's performance so far?\n8. Signing Cole Beasley to a contract extension Machota: \"A new four-year deal for Beasley is a move that should greatly benefit Tony Romo. The receiver Jason Garrett often says is \"quarterback friendly\" played some of his best ball down the stretch last season. During the Cowboys' final six games, they went 5-1 as Beasley totaled 277 yards and four touchdowns. In the two playoff games, he caught seven passes for 101 yards.\"\nHow would you grade Cole Beasley's performance so far?\n7.) Signing Darren McFadden Machota: \"With DeMarco Murray joining the rival Eagles, the Cowboys needed another back. They went with this former top five pick who only had one 1,000-yard season in seven years with the Raiders. McFadden will likely split carries with Joseph Randle. Could the Cowboys' talented offensive line pave the way for McFadden' best pro season? It's a possibility if he stays healthy. He showed glimpses of his potential during the third preseason game against Minnesota.\"\nHow would you grade Darren McFadden's performance so far?\n6. Signing Greg Hardy Machota: \"It was obviously a highly controversial move. Hardy's off-the-field issues led to a 10-game suspension from the league. That has since been reduced to four games. Hardy could still fight to get that total reduced further. Either way, when the 2013 Pro Bowler gets on the field, he will instantly upgrade Rod Marinelli's group of rushmen.\"\nHow would you grade Greg Hardy's performance so far?\n5. Acquiring a third first-round talent Machota: \"As if drafting Byron Jones and Randy Gregory weren't enough, the Cowboys landed another elite college talent when they signed La'el Collins following the draft. The former LSU standout left tackle went undrafted after he was part of a murder investigation. He was never considered a person of interest or a suspect by police. Collins, who was free to sign with any team, chose the Cowboys after Jerry Jones rolled out the red carpet during a recruiting visit at Jones' home. Jason Garrett, Tony Romo, Jason Witten and several Cowboys offensive linemen were all in attendance. Collins showed glimpses during the preseason of why many considered him a first-round pick.\"\nHow would you grade La'el Collins' performance so far?\n4. Having a strong draft Machota: \"Even though a draft class can't accurately be graded after only a few months, the Cowboys turned heads by landing what some would consider two first-round picks. A defensive back like Byron Jones and a pass-rusher like Randy Gregory have star potential. They are both expected to immediately contribute. Many teams wanted no part of Gregory because of off-the-field concerns, which allowed him to fall into the second round. The pick was a risk, but the payoff could be huge. In Dallas, Gregory won't be asked to start right away. He can learn from one of the game's best defensive gurus while gradually adding weight to become an every down player.\"\nHow would you grade the performance of Byron Jones, Randy Gregory and other 2015 draftees?\n3. Locking up their offensive and defensive coordinators Machota: \"The Cowboys arguably had the best combination of coordinators in the NFL last season. Rod Marinelli is as good as they come when you're talking about defensive football. The same can be said about Scott Linehan when talking offense. To build off last season's success, it was critical to keep the continuity throughout the coaching staff. Both signed three-year deals.\"\nHow would you grade Scott Linehan and Rod Marinelli's performance so far?\n2. Giving Jason Garrett a contract extension Machota: \"Many would say that the head coach is the most important piece of a football team. The Cowboys believe they have found the right one in Garrett. Over the previous four and a half seasons, the former NFL quarterback has led the Cowboys to a 41-31 record, including a 12-4 mark last season. He was rewarded with a five-year extension in January.\"\nHow would you grade Jason Garrett's performance so far?\n1. Signing Dez Bryant to a long-term contract Machota: \"Outside of Tony Romo, Bryant is the Cowboys' most valuable player. His ability on the field changes the way defenses gameplan for the Cowboys. Even though he was under the franchise tag, Bryant made it clear that he was willing to skip training camp and games if a long-term deal wasn't reached by the July 15 deadline. Jerry Jones and Stephen Jones flew to New York to get a deal done with Bryant's representatives in the final hour. Now, the Cowboys head into the season with a happy Bryant, who will be preparing to play in all 16 games.\"\nHow would you grade Dez Bryant's performance so far?\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nMoore: Five significant issues Cowboys need to focus on during bye week, including team's identity\nGosselin: What to expect from Randy Gregory if he returns after Cowboys bye week\nMoore: What to make of Brandon Weeden's play, how Cowboys QB handles adversity\nReplacing Romo, Dez and DeMarco Murray: Vote and grade these 10 Dallas Cowboys players, units\nHow 10 of the newest Cowboys are faring so far this season\nJon Machota answers Cowboys questions at 11 a.m. Oct. 23; ask your questions now\nGeorge: 'Rabid dog' Dez Bryant, 'hard-headed' Joseph Randle among 5 former Oklahoma State standouts now starring for Dallas Cowboys\nMachota: Why the Cowboys will repeat as NFC East champions\nSturm: Scott Linehan's logic is making it easier to defend Cowboys\nMoore: Can Greg Hardy's season be as good as his first game?\nGosselin: Why the Cowboys miss Bill Callahan this season\nCowlishaw: Why Cowboys' backup QB battle isn't something to get too caught up in\nMachota: Risky to rush Dez Bryant back; which Cowboys RB best compares to DeMarco Murray?\nBob Sturm: Brandon Weeden limited the Cowboys offense, the offense didn't limit Weeden\nLatest news, photos Top 15 fan photos from the Cowboys' first five games, including the Pope, an octo-bong, Left Shark and more\nTop 15 photos from the Cowboys' first five games; Terrance Williams levitates, Erin Andrews can't even\nCowboys WR Dez Bryant returns to alma mater Friday for Lufkin's homecoming\nJerry Jones: Cowboys QB Matt Cassel will take more chances, and that could lead to more turnovers\nJerry Jones: Yes, we miss Bill Callahan, but I'm not disappointed in Joseph Randle or our running game\nGreg Hardy: Should you root for him?
