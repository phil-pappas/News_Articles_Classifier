Memo Diaz tallied 30 seconds later, in the 75th minute, on a helper from Jason Lazarevski to hand YC the 2-0 advantage that stood.Suiting up for its fourth game in eight days, Yavapai - which leads NJCAA D-I in goals scored with 68 in 15 matches - snapped Chandler-Gilbert's five-game winning streak. Despite the low score, Yavapai dominated, out-shooting the Coyotes, 38-10.Meanwhile, the Roughriders' stingy defense pitched its eighth shutout of the season facing a Chandler-Gilbert club that dropped to 7-4-1 in the ACCAC but held its ground in the middle of the league's 10-team standings. Yavapai keeper Greg Patenaude played all 90 minutes in goal for the victory.The Roughriders have another busy week ahead, as they will play four matches from Saturday, Oct. 3, to Saturday, Oct. 10. Three of those games will be on the road.Next up, Yavapai visits a struggling South Mountain C.C. squad (1-12-0) at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Phoenix. YC blistered the Cougars, 8-1, last month in Prescott Valley.
