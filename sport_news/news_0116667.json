She has to send everything back in a prepaid envelope within three days or she'll get charged for all of it. \n\"I feel like I'm gearing more toward online shopping than I am in the store because as a parent you're busy and you don't have a lot of time to go try on clothes so these things have really worked with our lifestyle,\" Bartel said. \nBartel takes pictures of what she gets in each box and writes up a review on her Facebook page. When her friends sign up, she gets a discount. You can check out reviews on all kinds of subscription boxes at MySubcriptionAddition.com . Liz Cadmen started it in 2012 after signing up for beauty samples through BirchBox. \n\"And the most popular boxes do deliver a value that's at least double what you paid. And then of course the other thing is will you actually use those items yourself, because if it's something you won't use, even if it's a high value item, it's not a good value for you,\" Cadmen said. \nCadmen lists more than 1,400 boxes with another five added to the site every week. She says you'll get the best deal if you sign up for six or 12 months upfront. Cadmen says it's also best to sign up using PayPal if possible. \n\"You can cancel all your subscriptions through your Pay Pal account. You don't have to call in or go through any other type of hassle that some boxes may have to make you cancel,\" Cadmen said. \nDon't like something in your box? MySubcriptionAddiction.com even offers a page where you can swap items with someone else. And expect to see some good deals on subscriptions coming up on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \nSome new boxes are also gaining in popularity are those filled with comics and toys, home décor and books. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
