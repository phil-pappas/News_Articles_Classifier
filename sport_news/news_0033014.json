Television news reports from the coast showed some toppled trees and lampposts and inundated streets. Milenio TV carried footage of cars and buses being swept by floodwaters in the state of Jalisco.\nBut authorities said there were no immediate reports of fatalities or the kind of major, widespread damage feared earlier in the day when forecasters warned of a potentially \"catastrophic\" landfall.\nHistory's most destructive hurricanes \"The first reports confirm that the damage has been less than those expected from a hurricane of this magnitude,\" President Enrique Pena Nieto said in a taped address late Friday. He added, however, that \"we cannot yet let our guard down.\"\nIndeed, Patricia's projected path was headed next over a mountainous region dotted with hamlets that are at risk for dangerous mudslides and flash floods, and where communications can be sketchy. It wasn't clear when emergency crews would be able to fully assess the storm's impact in those isolated areas.\nThe storm was expected to weaken rapidly and dissipate Saturday, but it was still capable of soaking the region with heavy rain.\nPeople preparing for the arrival of hurricane Patricia board up the windows of a seaside business in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015. Hurricane Patricia grew into a monster, Category 5 storm and bore down on Mexico’s central Pacific Coast, on or near Puerto Vallarta, on Thursday night for what forecasters said could be a devastating blow, as officials declared a state of emergency and handed out sandbags in preparation for flooding. (AP Photo/Cesar Rodriguez) Patricia \"continues to advance and continues to be extremely dangerous,\" national civil protection coordinator Luis Felipe Puente warned via Twitter. \"Stay informed and follow recommendations.\"\nPatricia's center made landfall as a monstrous Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph), but in a relatively low-populated stretch of the Jalisco state coast near Cuixmala. The nearest significant city, Manzanillo, was about 55 miles (85 kilometers) southeast and outside the zone of the storm's hurricane-force winds.\nBy late Friday, Patricia was rapidly losing steam but was still a major hurricane with winds at 130 mph (215 kph), the center reported, or just above the threshold for a Category 4.\nA worker carries a table at a seaside restaurant preparing for the arrival of hurricane Patricia in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

Streets were deserted except for police patrolling slowly with their emergency lights on.\nBrandie Galle, a tourist from Grants Pass, Oregon, said she sheltered with other guests in a ballroom with boarded-up windows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Puerto Vallarta. Workers let them out to eat in a hotel restaurant after the city was not feeling any major effects from the storm two hours after landfall. There was no visible damage to the building.\nGalle said some guests desperate to leave had earlier paid $400 for taxis to drive them the 120 miles (200 kilometers) to the inland city of Guadalajara.\nPeople walks past a shop with the windows taped in preparation for the arrival of hurricane Patricia in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

(AP Photo/Cesar Rodriguez) Patricia formed suddenly Tuesday as a tropical storm and quickly strengthened to a hurricane. Within 30 hours it had zoomed to a record-beating Category 5 storm, catching many off guard with its rapid growth.\nBy Friday it was the most powerful hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere, with a central pressure of 880 millibars and maximum sustained winds of 200 mph (325 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center.\nPatricia's power while still out at sea was comparable to that of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 dead or missing in the Philippines two years ago, according to the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization. More than 4 million people were displaced and over 1 million houses were destroyed or damaged in 44 provinces in the central Visayas region, a large cluster of islands.\nPeople preparing for the arrival of hurricane Patricia box their merchandise at a seafront jewellery shop in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

Authorities opened hundreds of shelters and sent thousands of emergency crews to aid people.\nAccording to the 2010 census, there were more than 7.3 million inhabitants in Jalisco state and more than 255,000 in Puerto Vallarta municipality. There were more than 650,000 in Colima state, and more than 161,000 in Manzanillo.\nOne of the worst Pacific hurricanes to ever hit Mexico slammed into the same region, in Colima state, in October 1959, killing at least 1,500 people, according to Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention.\nPeople watch as Papantla Flyers perform on the seafront in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

By night they were back where they began: at their hotel, and no worse for wear.\n\"It's amazing it went from the worst in history to just some heavy rain,\" Susanna Sokol said, noting that at least the hurricane gave her daughter a birthday to remember.\n\"It was pretty stressful for a while,\" Tom Sokol said. \"I felt guilty for taking my kids here.\"\nPeople preparing for the arrival of hurricane Patricia board up a souvenir shop in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.
