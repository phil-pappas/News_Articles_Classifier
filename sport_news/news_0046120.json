Posted: Updated: \nFor the sixth time in Conference history, Baylor was selected as the 2015-16 preseason favorite to win the Big 12 women’s basketball regular season title, in a vote of the league’s head coaches. \nThe Lady Bears were also picked at the top of the preseason rankings in 2005-06 and four-consecutive seasons from 2009-13. They have won or tied for six regular season titles, including the last five, as well as captured the past five Phillips 66 Big 12 Women’s Basketball Championship trophies. All told, the Lady Bears have won six regular season crowns and seven tournament titles. \nBaylor received eight of 10 first-place votes (coaches are not allowed to vote for their own teams). Second-place Texas and third-place Oklahoma each also received a first-place vote and were separated by just one point. Iowa State and TCU rounded out the top five and were also a point apart. West Virginia was picked sixth, followed by K-State, Oklahoma State, Texas Tech and Kansas. \nThe 2015-16 season gets underway on Friday, November 13 with a full slate of non-conference games. League action begins on Wednesday, December 30, as Baylor takes on Oklahoma State in Stillwater. \nBaylor returns eight lettermen off last season’s NCAA Championship Elite Eight and Big 12 Championship squad, including Big 12 Player of the Year Nina Davis. Davis, a 5-11 junior forward, led the Big 12 in scoring at 21.1 points per game and ranked No. 4 in rebounding with 8.3 a contest. Two other starters, guards Niya Johnson and Alexis Prince, return as well. Johnson set Big 12 records for single-season assists (322) and assist/turnover ratio (4.13). Johnson ranked No. 1 nationally in assists per game (8.9) and No. 2 in assist/turnover ratio. Baylor’s freshman recruiting class, which ranked No. 4 nationally, is led by posts Kalani Brown (6-7) and Beatrice Mompremier (6-4). Junior guard Alexis Jones, an All-ACC transfer from Duke, will see her first action in green and gold this season. \nA Big 12 Women’s Basketball Preview Show will be televised on FOX Sports affiliates prior to the beginning of the regular season. The first airing is scheduled on FOX Sports Southwest Monday, November 9 at 7:00 p.m. CT. Check local listings for additional airings on FOX Sports Midwest and FOX College Sports (FCS). \n2015-16 Big 12 Conference Women’s Basketball Preseason Poll \n1. Baylor (8) – 80 points \n2.
