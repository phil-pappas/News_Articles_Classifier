The result was a 42-12 victory for Watkins Glen/O-M on Friday night in a battle of Section 4 Conference division leaders. \nChedzoy finished the game with 149 yards and five touchdowns on 24 carries as the Seneca Indians (6-1 overall, 2-0 Div. V) extended their win streak to six games since a season-opening loss to Owego. WG/O-M has outscored its last three opponents, 161-34. \n\"The lineman did a great job of blocking the line and getting me into the secondary,\" Chedzoy said. \"Once I got my momentum going, I could just keep my legs moving and I seemed to get some yards.\" \nChedzoy admitted that, when Groton made its run early in the second half, he was feeling a little sense of deja vu. \n\"I felt like this might have been the old Watkins,\" he said. \"We did that last year a couple of times, scored big in the first half and let teams come back. But then we just pulled it back together, fixed it on defense and started doing what we do.\" \nJunior running back Matt Gombas rushed 19 times for 104 yards and a score for Groton (4-3, 3-1 Div. VIII), which trailed 14-0 after one quarter and 20-0 before junior Dylan Cooper's 5-yard run made it 20-6 with 1 1/2 minutes left in the first half. \nChedzoy scored on a pair of 1-yard runs in the first quarter to put the visitors on top early. Then following the first of three interceptions by Groton quarterback Daimon Shoemaker (6-for-23, 88 yards), Chedzoy capped a 24-yard drive with a 3-yard plunge to put the Seneca Indians up by 20. \nThe 5-8, 180-pound Chedzoy added scoring runs of 8 and 7 yards in the fourth quarter, and was the featured back for much of the second half as he gained all but 39 of his yards after the break. Senior defensive back Chris Foote capped the scoring when he picked off a Shoemaker pass near midfield and sprinted up the left sideline to the end zone with 3:45 to play. \nWatkins Glen/O-M is scheduled to play host to Lansing (4-3, 2-0 Div. V) next Saturday night, with the winner taking the Division V championship. \n\"That's been my goal for the four years I've been playing football,\" Chedzoy said, referring to winning a division title. \"It feels great to have a chance to do that.\" \nLansing was forced to forfeit its game with Chenango Forks on Friday due to an insufficient number of healthy players. Lansing director of athletics Adam Heck said he will re-evaluate the team's health situation on Monday. \nGroton's next game is in the first round of the Section 4 Class D playoffs, next weekend against an opponent to be determined. 8 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ithacajr.nl/1LyXlGe TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:21:49.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
