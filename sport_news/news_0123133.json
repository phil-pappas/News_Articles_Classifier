Three Minneapolis police officers are suing the city after their names were made public following an undercover massage parlor bust.\nThe three officers caused controversy in August when cases against the parlor were dismissed after it was revealed they went beyond the call of duty.\nProsecutors discovered the trio had engaged in sexual conduct with their female targets before arresting them.\nAlthough the officers were unidentified in the lawsuit, they claim that data on undercover officers is private and the failure to redact their names violated the Minnesota Data Practices Act.\nNow, they are suing the city, county and state for $15,000 for each violation of the act, reported The Star Tribune .\nStevica Mrdja/iStock Prosecutors discovered the trio had engaged in sexual conduct with their female targets before arresting them. Lt. Bob Kroll, head of the police union, said the officers' names should have been redacted through the entire process.\nHe said undercover investigations are often dangerous and that officers are forced to work in unpleasant situations to secure prosecutions.\nHe said: \"They didn't do anything wrong, The city should have known better. It's a clear violation of law.\"\nThe lawsuit says that since the officers' names were disclosed, the officers and their families have suffered \"stress, anxiety, and emotional damage.\"\nSteve Marcus/Reuters Police are often required to go undercover to secure prosecutions. The officers have also been harassed at work and their reputations have been damaged, the lawsuit claims.\nOne officer says has been shamed because of the nature of his undercover work and that he \"has been excluded from the ability to practice his religion within his community.\"\nCity Attorney Susan Segal confirmed the city received the lawsuit and added that the city takes its obligations under the Minnesota Data Practices Act \"very seriously.\"\nThe police department has since suspended its use of undercover details in massage parlors.\nlhanna@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.startribune.com/apnewsbreak-3-cops-sue-minneapolis-after-names-revealed/331415021/"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:21:57.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
