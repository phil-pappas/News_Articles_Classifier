For me, the cause is personal. \nI played football at John Jay Cross River, coached at Albertus Magnus, and I'm a lifelong football fan; my brothers, cousins and closest friends are former Section 1 athletes. \nHigh school football played a big role in my upbringing. It taught me about responsibility, teamwork, and leadership. I was lucky to have an incredible group of coaches that treated my teammates and I like young men and expected us to act accordingly. Some of my closest friends are the guys that I shared a field with and we all know how fortunate we are to have had such a special experience. \nI believe that there are groups of former teammates all over the country that share a connection unlike any other; once you have worked so hard for and depended on one another, you are forever bonded. As a coach, I try to pass on the lessons that had been engrained in me as a player. My family is a sports family and they've always supported me on and off the field. My parents were actively involved in my football career and always emphasized the importance of sports and fitness. My father was an exercise lover, conscious eater, and advocate of healthy living. \nWhen he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, we were all shocked. In August 2013, my 62-year-old otherwise perfectly healthy father passed away from the disease. \nI was in the middle of coaching double sessions. It took me a full year to realize that the best way to honor his memory was to do something positive. The connection between football and prostate cancer awareness seemed natural to me. Most of the men in my life have spent some time on a football field or in the stands and men are dying in part because they are going without regular checkups and are embarrassed to speak about the disease. If we, as men, can come together and encourage one another to take responsibility for our own health, we can save lives. Inspired by the breast cancer movement, I decided to make it my goal to flood football fields in light blue every September. Now, each season, I tour Section 1, encouraging coaches and young athletes to join the Section 1 Brotherhood and wear light blue in support of the men on the field, the men in the stands, and the men who can no longer speak for themselves. Getting the younger generation involved is important because they are in the dark about this disease. I am trying to show these young men that they are responsible for erasing the stigma and pushing one another to take on the challenge of making a difference. Last season, 13 teams sported light blue wristbands for the month. This year, 12 teamsâ€™ helmets are adorned with light blue ribbon decals. I would like to thank Ramapo, Pearl River, Albertus Magnus, Haldane, Briarcliff, John Jay, Byram Hills, New Rochelle, Our Lady of Lourdes, Brewster, Fox Lane, and Somers for helping my achieve my mission. Hopefully, next year's list is even longer! In the future, I hope that all of Section 1 gets behind the movement and join the Brotherhood. \nTommy Albano has coached football, basketball, and golf at Albertus Magnus. A new father, he currently coaches modified field hockey at Briarcliff High School.
