(AP Photo/Kathy Kmonicek) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Steven Matz is one of 11 pitchers on the New York Mets’ roster for the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nThe team announced its roster Friday, several hours before Game 1 at Dodger Stadium. \nMatz has been struggling with a back problem. The rookie left-hander threw about 90 pitches in a simulated game Thursday in Florida to test himself. \nSean Gilmartin had accompanied the Mets to Los Angeles as a backup in case Matz was unable to go. \nThe roster includes six infielders and six outfielders, two catchers and 11 pitchers.
