To be considered a fundraising success, the Republican presidential candidate had to hit the magic number of $100 million, an ambitious goal set by some in his campaign. And he did.\nAs another fundraising period ends, what now constitutes success for Bush isn't as clear cut. No longer the front-runner in preference polls, Bush won't repeat as the champion at raising money in the GOP's 2016 field, lapped in the past three months by retired surgeon Ben Carson and perhaps by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, too.\nBut Bush's financial team and strategists argue that he should now be judged by a different benchmark. Their mantra: He's built to last.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
