As senior Michael Cognetta pointed out: It’s all about the chemistry. “We’ve clicked as a team and we have good camaraderie among everybody,” Cognetta said. “It’s good chemistry.” Cognetta, Michael Collins and Kyle Smith earned a large portion of the spotlight on Saturday, as the Rams scored seven touchdowns in the first half and routed the Danbury Hatters, 48-7, on homecoming day at Danbury High School. Collins reeled off six more touchdown passes — giving him 23 in four games — and Smith was on the receiving end of four of those scores, including a 36-yarder during the first quarter. Cognetta was a force on both sides of the ball, rushing nine times for 121 yards, catching three passes for 31 yards, scoring two touchdowns — one on the ground and one through the air — and intercepting two passes on defense. His performance running the ball gave the Rams a near even-split on offense with 176 passing yards and 173 rushing, and he gave much of the credit to the offensive line, which featured Lucas Niang, Gardner Read, Will Conley and Teddy Hood. “They played fantastic,” Cognetta said. “I think you could’ve put anybody at running back and they would’ve run the ball just as well as I did today.” “We weren’t even sure he was going to play,” head coach Lou Marinelli said of Cognetta. “He was a little banged up, his brother (Matt) was a little banged up — but they’re gamers. All of a sudden, you flip the coin and those kids are ready to go.” The win, a welcome return to action after a bye week, gave the Rams a record of 4-0 and kept them atop the FCIAC Eastern Division standings. Danbury, which has faced the toughest schedule in the FCIAC so far, fell to 0-r. The Hatters have faced Staples, St. Joseph, Stamford and New Canaan, with a trip to Darien on tap next week. “We took that long bus ride to come up here and it could’ve been a game where we overlooked them because they haven’t won,” Marinelli said. “But they’ve played some pretty tough games. They knew they were playing an 0-3 team and yet they prepared really well and worked hard.” New Canaan’s defense also had sterling numbers against Danbury, allowing just 91 yards of total offense, including minus-13 rushing. Much of the yardage came during the second half, after the Rams starters were pulled, and the Hatters scored their lone touchdown midway through the third quarter. Danbury’s biggest threat, senior RB/DB Tyren McRea, was held to minus-11 yards rushing on 14 carries, and three receptions for 44 yards. The defensive featured Mike and Matt Cognetta, David Strupp, Matt Hall, Andrew Chalon, Sam Larsen and Niang, among others. On offense, Smith had a big day with 67 yards on four receptions, all for touchdowns, while Andrew DeFranco had four catches for 31 yards and a touchdown. Graham Braden ran the ball during the second half and had 48 yards on seven carries. Collins was 14-of-21 passing for 163 yards. New Canaan scored early and often, finding the end zone on all five of its first-quarter possessions. Collins connected with Michael Cognetta for the first TD, as Cognetta caught the ball on his fingertips for a 19-yard catch at 2:03. New Canaan’s next drive covered 70 yards on three plays and ended with Collins throwing a a 20-yard TD pass to Smith at 6:16. Cognetta then intercepted a pass from Danbury QB Jordan Khuth and returned it to the Hatters’ three-yard line and, after a penalty, Collins hit DeFranco for an eight-yard score and a 21-0 lead. The next two TDs came on a 36- and eight-yard strikes to Smith, and Cognetta then ran for a 14-yard score to open the second quarter. “We knew they were a good team, we just wanted to make sure we played out hardest,” Cognetta said. “We had a lot of time to practice and study, so we knew what we were going to game plan for.” The Rams scored their final TD on a three-yard hook-up between Collins and Smith to make it 48-0 with 9:52 to play in the first half. Danbury averted the shutout in the second half when Khuth threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Lucas Arantes. Although the combined record of New Canaan’s first four opponents is just 3-13, the Rams haven’t been treating their opponents as inferior. “We’ve played really well against all of the teams, and it’s not like they weren’t up to our level,” Cognetta said. “We’ve just come out with fire and played as well as we can play. We are getting challenged and I think Greenwich next week will be a good challenge for us as well.” “Sooner or later, probably next week, we’re going to get punched in the mouth and we’ll see how we react,” Marinelli said. “I think we’ll be fine. We’re getting better, we’re developing, and I’m very pleased with the way we’ve been practicing and playing.” New Canaan’s Michael Cognetta catches a pass from Michael Cognetta in the back of the end zone fort one of seven Ram TDs in Saturday’s 48-7 win in Danbury. — Dave Stewart photo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:45:31.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
