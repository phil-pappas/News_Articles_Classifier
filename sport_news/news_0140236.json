The country hasn’t won this tournament since 1985.\nTerrence Romeo scores off Lebanon’s Jay Youngblood during their quarterfinal match in the FIBA Asia Championship in Changsha, China last night.

The FIBA Asia winner offers the lone Olympic slot for the region. The last time the Philippines played in the Olympics was in 1972 in Munich.\nJayson Castro once again delivered for Gilas with 25 points, punctuated by a booming three-pointer, his fifth and final of the game, that gave his team a 74-62 lead with 2:12 left in the game.\nNaturalized Andray Blatche also had a huge game with 24 points, 17 rebounds, three assists and two blocks despite hurting his right shoulder following a hard foul by his Lebanon counterpart Jay Youngblood.\n“We got the win, that’s the most important thing,” said Blatche, before responding to a statement made by Lebanon Coach Veselin Matic, who on Tuesday called the Gilas battle as “easy”.\n“They had a lot to say before the game. We know it won’t come easy, but we took them out and shut them up.”\nGilas took a 61-52 lead on a three by Gabe Norwood early in the fourth quarter but saw Lebanon cut the margin to 61-57 on a Youngblood triple with 6:52 left to the delight of a Chinese crowd hoping for an upset.\nBut the Filipinos countered the mini-run of the Lebanese as Blatche connived with Terrence Romeo, Marc Pingris and Castro with crucial baskets to spark a celebration headed by Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas President Manny V. Pangilinan.\n“I’m pretty sure (the Chinese fans) want to see (Lebanon) rather than us,” said Blatche, who shrugged off jeers by the Chinese crowd by making four straight free throws late. “I’m used to that (jeers), I played in bigger level.”\nPHILIPPINES 82 – Castro 25, Blatche 24, Romeo 10, Pingris 8, Abueva 7, Norwood 5, De Ocampo 3, Ganuelas 0, Thoss 0, Hontiveros 0.\nLEBANON 70 – Haidar 18, Bawji 17, Youngblood 12, AB Del nour 8, Arakji 8, Saoud 7, Akl 0.\nQuarters: 20-16; 37-32; 57-49; 82-70.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:35:53.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
