GENEVIEVE, MO (KFVS) - Do you believe in ghosts? One Ste. Genevieve, Mo. husband and wife say they've been living with ghosts for years, and they have proof to back it up.\nParts of Ste. Genevieve date back centuries, but for Bob and Stacy Browne, they say there's more than just history in their 210-year-old home.\n\"Yeah, they're not going to leave,\" Bob Browne said.\nThe Brownes say they have encounters with ghosts in their home on a regular basis.\n\"It doesn't bother us none,\" Browne said.\nThey say it can be as simple as touch on the shoulder or sounds of footsteps coming from upstairs when no one is there.\nAudio recordings compiled by paranormal investigators in the home appear to capture messages from another realm.\nRecords show the home belonged to Dr. Walter Fenwick in 1805. He used it as a residence and office. He lived there with his wife and son, Zenon.\nBoth the doctor and the boy eventually died in the home. That's where the Brownes say their spirits are today.\nIn one audio recording, you can hear the TV in the background and the investigator asks for a name. The Brownes say it's the little boy, Zenon, who answers back. [ Watch the video attached to the story to hear the audio.]\nA trip to the home's cellar reveals a treasure trove of artifacts.\nThe Brownes keep some of the items Bob has dug up on display.\nHe said he's found human bones, medical supplies and tools buried underneath the house. It's a good place for more strange occurrences.\n\"That red one sitting right back there, that was thrown from back there and hit the wheel barrel,\" Browne said.\nJust across the street is the Memorial Cemetery, one of the oldest in the state, and where the home's original occupants are buried.\nFor years the Brownes have been seeing and listening to the signs.\nThere's no doubt in their minds, history is alive in their home.\n\"When it happens to you over and over and you hear it and see it, no it's happening,\" Browne said.\nBelieve it or not, the Brownes say they are fine living with the paranormal activity.\nIn fact, they say it's an honor to have so many encounters.\nIf you'd like to experience the Browne's home for yourself, they say they welcome guests. The house is located at 498 Merchant Street in Ste. Genevieve, Mo.\nDownload the KFVS News app: iPhone | Android\nCopyright 2015 KFVS .
