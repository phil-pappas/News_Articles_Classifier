That thought, sometimes spoken and more often just implied, runs through many policy discussions in the Legislature and some city council chambers.\nThe Big Idea The Oregonian/OregonLive's fourth Big Idea forum, Nurturing Small Business, will explore regulations and other issues at 6:30 Wednesday at the University of Oregon's George S. Turnbull Portland Center, 70 NW Couch Street. You can register for the event at this website. Panel members: Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose; Beaverton Mayor Denny Doyle; Charles Funches, loan portfolio manager for Micro Enterprise Services of Oregon; Franz Spielvogel, chief executive officer of Laughing Planet; and David Chown of Chown Hardware. Here's one of the big problems with that line of reasoning: New policies or programs seldom require businesses to make only a single change. More often, they trigger a series of cascading moves. The additional paperwork is far from trivial for fledgling businesses with thin profit margins.\nIt's also worth remembering that many small businesses operate in more than one city or country. More than a few operate in more than one state, particularly in the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area. And it's not just where a business is located that matters. It has to know, and abide by, the rules and regulations in cities within which it conducts business.\nConsider Chown Hardware. The family owned business has only two locations â€“ Portland and Bellevue, Washington. But it does service work in other Seattle and Portland suburbs, as well as cities such as Longview, Ashland and Medford, said co-owner David Chown. Sure, there are ways to cope, but the adjustments businesses make come at a cost.\n\"It's a very difficult hill to climb, and it's not what you go into business to do,\" said Chown, whose 80-employee company hires outside companies to handle payroll and consult on human resources. Human resources consultants, in particular, become almost a necessity for multistate business, he said. There are too many rules to keep track of without help.\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms", "external_links": ["http://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-big-idea-nurturing-small-business-tickets-19050952913?aff=BoardShare"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:16:26.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
