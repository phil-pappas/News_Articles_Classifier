(AP) - Lafayette's Cajundome has been more of an eyesore lately with streaks of dirt and mildew cascading down the exterior of the dome.\nCajundome Director Greg Davis told The Daily Advertiser ( http://bit.ly/1RxAk7s ) the roof needs to be fixed.\nIn fact, Davis and his crew have known for three years that the dome roof needs to be addressed. They just didn't have the $1.2 million needed to do it.\nNow they do.\nDavis says a hotel/motel tax the state rebates to the Cajundome is being used to issue bonds and generate the $1.2 million needed to clean and re-seal the roof. He expects work to begin in the spring, probably in March.\nInformation from: The Advertiser, http://www.theadvertiser.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
