Jones appeared to be in significant pain both as he was treated on the field and while on the sidelines as the offense was on the field, but returned for the first defensive snap of the second half and played the rest of the game. \nWhitworth is likely taking a veteran's day off as he has done at least one day per week this season and did almost every week last season. \nIloka took himself out of Sunday's game with an ankle injury and was replaced by Shawn Williams. Iloka played 43 defensive snaps in the game and Williams played 31. \nCornerback Dre Kirkpatrick it appeared was going to be a limited participant in Wednesday's practice. He got dinged up while tackling Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith as he went into the end zone on Sunday, but didn't miss a single defensive snap in the game. \nThe team will release the official practice participation report when practice concludes around 1:15 p.m. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:36:16.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
