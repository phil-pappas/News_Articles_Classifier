Strasburg (11-7) gave up six hits and struck out seven in six innings. In his final four starts of the season, he finished 3-0 with an 0.62 ERA. He had 44 strikeouts in 29 innings. Braves rookie Ryan Weber (0-3) pitched very well on a damp and misty night, giving up five hits while striking out a career-high 10 in seven innings. Rookie Felipe Rivero retired all six batters he faced in the eighth and ninth innings for his first save. It was the first save opportunity for the Nationals since closer Jonathan Papelbon was suspended for the final week of the season. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
