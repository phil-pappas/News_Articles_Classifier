His wife and daughters were by his side when he died.\nRelated: Brian Friel obituary\nPaying tribute to the Co Tyrone-born writer, Sheila Pratschke, chairwoman of Ireland’s Arts Council, said Friel had earned himself recognition among the world’s greatest playwrights.\n“The Irish theatre and arts world generally is devastated by this sad, sad loss,” she said.\n“Brian was an inspiration to Irish playwrights, actors, directors and theatre-makers. It is the mark of the man and his achievement as a writer that his work is conjured by use of his surname only.”\nDancing at Lughnasa won a Tony award in the US in 1992 and was later turned into a film starring Meryl Streep.\nAmong Friel’s admirers was former US president Bill Clinton, who described him as “as an Irish treasure for the entire world”.\nRelated: Brian Friel: Ireland's great theatrical explorer\nOriginally from the Tyrone village of Dromore, Friel moved to Derry at the age of 10. He went to the same Catholic boys’ grammar school in the city as two Nobel laureates – Seamus Heaney and John Hume. Friel once described himself in a radio documentary as the “son of a teacher and grandson of peasants who could neither read nor write”.\nSome of his other plays included the The Gentle Island, The Freedom of the City, Aristocrats, Faith Healer, Translations, Making History, Molly Sweeney, Give Me Your Answer Do! and The Home Place.\nA production of Dancingat Lughnasa is due to begin a run in the Dublin theatre festival next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:36:53.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
