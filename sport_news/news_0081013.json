While Kolkata struck in the 13th minute through a spectacular Arata Izumi volley, it was Keenan Almeida’s cracking right-footer that restored parity for Zico’s men in the 81st minute in an ill-tempered match. ATK’s Baljit Sahni was shown the first red card of the season after he head-butted opposition defender Gregory Arnolin, bringing back memories of the last season when the latter was involved in a similar incident with the then ATK striker Fikru Teferra. The Goan outfit dominated tonight as they created more opportunities throughout the match but in the end were able to manage only a point. Arata, a Japanese citizen of Indian origin, who has played for the Indian national team, was the man of the match. FC Goa’s left-half Jofre Mateu was a livewire with his assists and pinpoint crosses. ATK got the lead in the 13th minute against the run of play. Winger Javi Lara sent in a cross from the right and Arata fired in a volley that beat a diving goalie Elinton Andrade. However, that was the only positive move that ATK managed as FC Goa came back with a lot of vigour. Skipper Lucio was seen on the overlap while Jofre fed some great balls for Reinaldo and Le Moura upfront. Oftense Nato and Denzel Franco had a great game at the back. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:03:10.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
