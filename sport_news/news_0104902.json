But the Grizzlies changed their practice time following Thursday’s workout.\nSo today’s training camp session will instead air from 3-5 p.m. CST.\nThe Real Training Camp series began Tuesday and the Griz edition of the show will include interviews with players, coaches and front-office personnel.\nWhat more should you expect to see?\n-- The No. 1 goal in training camp is to exit injury-free. So far, so good. The Grizzlies have a mature roster with several players at least 30 years old. Led by 38-year-old Vince Carter, the veterans appear spry and in decent-to-great condition. There won’t be anyone slated to be in the rotation who will look hobbled or limited.\n-- Just like death and taxes, there apparently is this constant in life for the Griz: You can count on head coach Dave Joerger losing his voice during training camp. It happened in each of his first two seasons at the helm. Thursday, Joerger began to sound hoarse.\n-- Courtney Lee and Matt Barnes have shot the basketball well throughout four practices since Tuesday. Don’t be surprised by their shot-making in drills and a possible scrimmage.\nBarnes and Brandan Wright, the two newcomers, are fitting in just fine.\n“Playing them so much while I was a Clipper I really picked up on what this team is about and how they play,” Barnes said. “It’s been a smooth transition for me. I’m picking up the three spot and they want me to play the four so it takes a little bit of studying but it’s been a smooth transition.”\nWright’s assimilation has been helped by Carter. The pair played together in Dallas for a few seasons.\n“They (coaches and management) asked me about what kind of guy he is and I think it’s obvious,” Carter said. “I know the guy in and out and how he plays. It’s great to have him.”\n-- In case you missed it, Carter is noticeably in much better shape to start this camp than he was before the 2014-15 campaign.\nAt the age of 38, Vince Carter ( @mrvincecarter15 ) can still ... pic.twitter.com/eqXrhyrJie\n— P3 (@P3sportscience) September 30, 2015\n-- Joerger is a strong voice but not the lone one. Joerger utilizes his assistant coaches so you'll likely see Elston Turner and Jeff Bzdelik among others instructing different drills.\n-- Point guard Mike Conley has 24-inch pythons, a la Hulk Hogan, and is in the best shape he’s been in years.\n-- Dan Nwaelele, 31, is a 6-4 guard trying to make an NBA team for the first time. His story is inspiring because Nwaelele’s dream had been on hold while serving five years in the Air Force.\nIn 2007, Nwaelele was offered a two-year contract with the San Antonio Spurs following an impressive four-year basketball career with Air Force. He played for Bzdelik, who coached Air Force from 2005-07.\nBut the Air Force wouldn't let Nwaelele leave his five-year commitment, and he served in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.\nNwaelele never stopped pursuing his dream of playing in the NBA, and Joerger sees why.\n“He can really shoot,” Joerger said. “He’s a really good guy. He picks up stuff really well. He’s a hired gun. He’s not a young guy but he’s got a great story. The guy has served our country. I’ve got a lot of respect for him. Hopefully, he can find his way onto an NBA team.”\nThe Griz have 15 guaranteed contracts with most of their depth made up of proven wing players. Nwaelele won’t make the Griz roster but could get a chance to showcase his skills during the preseason.\n-- Tony Allen wreaked havoc before a hamstring injury took him out of the playoffs last season. He’s already in mid-season form.\nThe Griz will conduct one final practice Saturday morning at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and then return to Memphis. The preseason schedule tips off Tuesday with the Griz hosting the Houston Rockets in FedExForum.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrvincecarter15", "http://t.co/eqXrhyrJie", "https://twitter.com/P3sportscience/status/649276066394050560"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:28:22.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
