(lehighvalleylive.com file photos) By Greg Joyce | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 08, 2015 8:47 PM View/Post Comments \nIn the early going of the high school football season, it had been tough for Parkland coach Jim Morgans to gauge what his team was capable of. \nThree of the Trojans’ first four games were against teams with losing records and led to blowout wins where the first team wasn’t playing by the end of the game. \nThat served up a test for the team last week when rival Whitehall took the early lead and Parkland (5-0) had to hold them off late. \n“We faced adversity for the first time,” Morgans said. “I was proud of the way they responded. That’s what I expect them to do. It was a good lesson for us.” \nRELATED : PIAA class expansion in multiple sports 'a really good thing' for District 11 \nIt was an important win to have heading into the crux of the Trojans’ schedule, beginning Friday night against Liberty at Bethlehem Area School District Stadium. \nThe three-time defending district champs will have four straight games against teams hoping to take them on for the EPC South title: the Hurricanes, Easton, Freedom and Nazareth. \n“You want to play in games like this and find out what you’re all about,” Morgans said. \nMorgans already knows what quarterback Devante Cross is all about, especially after the senior took the Whitehall game into his hands and put together a dominant night (13/20 for 268 yards and a TD; 30 rushes for 154 yards and four TDs). \nParkland has used a running back by committee with Erik DiGirolamo and Jahan Worth getting carries, while Temple commit Kenny Yeboah leads a solid stable of wide receivers. \nThe Trojans’ defense has allowed just 15 points per game and Morgans is looking for the unit’s strong play to continue against Liberty. \n“If it doesn’t, we’re going to be in trouble,” Morgans said. \nWhile Cross has led Parkland, Doug Erney has been just as valuable under center for the Hurricanes. \n“Doug Erney is a pain in the rear end, and I mean that in a positive way,” Morgans said. “He gives you a lot of trouble. Some quarterbacks will break out and they look to run. He breaks out and the feeling I get is he looks to throw the ball. That’s more dangerous.” \nParkland’s player to watch: Yeboah. How the wide receiver/defensive back matches up against Liberty’s wide receivers/defensive backs will be one of the most interesting matchups of the night. Yeboah has been able to use his 6-foot-5 frame to his advantage, especially in the red zone. But he also has the speed to hurt his opponents. \nLiberty’s player to watch: Justin Haynes . The senior free safety could have a busy night trying to shut down big plays by the Trojans, whether that means Cross airing it out or taking the ball himself on a scramble. Haynes has also developed into one of Erney’s reliable targets, which will be important against a strong defense. \nParkland will win if … Cross plays the way he’s capable of and the defense does its part. The Trojans don’t need to pitch a shutout, but they need to contain Erney and put some pressure on him early. This game could feature a lot of scoring, so it may come down to which defense is able to bend but not break. \nLiberty will win if … It plays mistake-free football. The Hurricanes have gotten away with some blunders during their wins – whether on defense or in penalties – but they won’t have much margin for error against Parkland. They’ll also need more of the same from their running back duo so the Trojans can’t just focus solely on Erney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:22:27.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
