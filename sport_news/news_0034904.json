No one can afford the luxury of negative thoughts, especially in old age. Hence, I am sharing certain personal details of a failed relationship. The school culture of the ’50s was very different from how it is today. It was the era of devoted teachers, industrious students, semi-educated parents, and a very concerned closely knit society. Small town co-education schools attracted a large number of students from nearby villages because parents trusted their daughters with the strict discipline of the school. In classrooms, boys and girls sat separately: the front rows were reserved for the small number of girls and the rest were for the boys. There was no interaction between the two. The girls were so shy that they would reply in low decibels even to the questions asked by lady teachers. And so, we moved in our own respective groups. In class X, a charming girl, who had studied in an all girls’ school, joined us and started sitting on the front benches, as was the practice. During the very first break, she walked up to the boys’ benches and started talking to us. It was not the done thing and she was reprimanded by the teachers and the other girls for the ‘misconduct’. Soon, she started moving closer to me after she discovered that I was the brightest student in the class. She would often approach me to help her in mathematics and borrowed my notebooks regularly. As she did all that in a rather brazen manner, the news travelled to the Headmaster. Both of us received a dressing down by our respective parents. Nonetheless, our meetings only increased, to the discomfort of teachers, the Headmaster and, most significantly, some boys in the class. I paid more compliments to her than she could possibly pay me, but she compensated that by placing short and sweet notes written in shudh Hindi in my notebooks. I was rebuked by my mother for neglecting my own studies to help her. I did not have the guts to take any liberties with her and kept the distance good boys were expected to keep from girls in our times. Also, I didn’t dare make any advances for fear of being rejected, as I thought she was too good for the likes of me. I was happy enjoying the attention I received from her, unaware that I had competition. Soon enough, I noticed that she had started taking special interest in another boy from the same class. He was good at studies and was better endowed than me in physical looks. However, I was confident that the crude and loud-mouthed boy from a village was no match for me and will fail in his attempts to dislodge me. But I was shocked when she started taking lesser and lesser notice of me. When we confronted each other, it was clear to me that she preferred to dump me in favour of my adversary. I had no option but to resign to my fate. I have not come across her in the past 57 years, but she taught me the lesson of my life — Nothing ventured, nothing gained.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:37:05.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
