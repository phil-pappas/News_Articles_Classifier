As Union Democrat reporter Sean Carson’s well-researched story showed, students in Tuolumne County public schools who need psychological, behavioral and emotional counseling are not getting the help they need. Carson found that while five of 13 schools have at least one full-time counselor, two have none at all and four employ counselors who work no more than three days a week. Tuolumne County School Superintendent Margie Bulkin told Carson she has always believed every school needs a full-time counselor and she speculated that perhaps the threats at Summerville High School earlier this month would make people aware of the shortfall. It is important to note that counseling students is among the many duties of the two grade-level coordinators at Summerville High School. Also worth saying is that the school in its statement of beliefs says it is committed to doing what’s best for every student and promises to provide a nurturing environment. Summerville is certainly not alone. Last week, a student at Soulsbyville Elementary, where a counselor is on duty 18 hours a week, threatened a teacher. It has often been said we have turned to our schools to solve all the problems of society. And in many ways it’s true. The public schools are mandated to take all the children who arrive at their doorsteps, no matter their readiness for learning or their ability to navigate the world. Yet the best schools are those that meet each child where he or she is and proceed to teach and to nurture. Counseling plays a huge role in that. One bright spot in Tuolumne County is the Learning Center, where students who have been expelled spend 50 percent of their time in counseling. But why wait until it gets to expulsion to help children? The Summerville teens — now being called the Summerville Four in the community — all face eight charges of conspiracy to commit assault, which are felonies. When the arrests were announced they were originally charged with conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon, but the charges were downgraded before they appeared in court. An official in the District Attorney’s office explained that the new charges better fit the evidence. There was never a deadly weapon. Many people Carson has interviewed have described one of the boys as troubled, a once fun-loving child who turned into an angry teen. An adult friend of the boy said, “He couldn’t organize a sandwich, let alone a mass shooting.” Another woman wrote a letter to the newspaper to say the county, the school and others let him down. He needed professional help that never came, she said. The young man’s friends say he often ate lunch alone and was bullied. Bullying is a pervasive problem in Tuolumne County schools, perhaps everywhere, but here a girl has been terrorized over the course of a year and punched by someone who Sonora High School and the Police Department have been unable to identify. The most recent threat was last week, a note found in her PE locker. The contents of that note were not released, but a previous one said, “Why don’t you kill yourself?” Two years ago, Summerville High School settled a lawsuit out of court and paid a family $12,000 because their son was bullied to the point of near suicide. The family said school officials did little to stop the harassment, which included a club started specifically as a hate group toward the boy. This, despite daylong workshops in which children are taught to be more considerate, more understanding of others who are different, who face challenges. Would circumstances have been different at Summerville High School earlier this month if that young man described as the leader of the group could have talked regularly with someone trained to work with struggling kids? Certainly. The county is shortchanging its most vulnerable students.
