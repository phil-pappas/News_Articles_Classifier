(AP) — North Carolina has indefinitely suspended cornerbacks M.J. Stewart and Mike Hughes for a violation of team rules, keeping them sidelined for Saturday’s game against Wake Forest. \nIn a release, the school said Stewart and Hughes were suspended from team-related activities tied to an Oct. 4 incident in Chapel Hill. The release didn’t specify exactly what rule they had broken, though a statement from coach Larry Fedora referenced an “altercation” and that UNC has worked with Chapel Hill police to gather information. \nFedora said coaches “hold our players to a high standard, and M.J. and Mike will face the consequences for their involvement.” \nStewart has started all five games for the Tar Heels (4-1), while Hughes has played all five games as a reserve.
