BALDOR\nAssociated Press LONDON (AP) - The U.S. will overhaul the failed Syrian rebel training program, working more closely with capable Kurdish and other forces in Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Friday.\nNo details were immediately available, but the $500 million program to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State group is widely considered a failure. It has produced fewer than 80 soldiers, many of whom had fled, been captured or killed in early fighting.\nCarter said at a news conference in London that the work the U.S. has done with the Kurds is a good example of an effective approach with a capable, motivated ground combat force. He did not provide more details.\nU.S. officials have said the new effort would focus more on embedding recruits with established Kurdish and Arab units, rather than sending them directly into front-line combat. Last week, a commander of one of the U.S.-trained rebel units turned over a half-dozen U.S. vehicles to extremist militants.\n\"The work we've done with the Kurds in northern Syria is an example of an effective approach,\" Carter said. \"That's exactly the kind of example that we would like to pursue with other groups in other parts of Syria going forward.\"\nHe called it a \"more strategic approach\" than what the U.S. has been doing from the beginning. \"We have been looking for now several weeks at ways to improve that program,\" Carter said. \"I wasn't satisfied with the early efforts in that regard.\"\nInstead of fighting IS in small units, the U.S.-trained rebels would be attached to larger existing Kurdish and Arab forces. They would be equipped with U.S. communications gear and trained to provide intelligence and to designate IS targets for airstrikes in coordination with U.S. troops outside of Syria, the officials said.\nThe $500 million training program has been beset by a series of embarrassing setbacks. The first group of trainees largely disbanded soon after they were sent into combat; some were captured or killed, while others fled. A second class yielded only a small number of new fighters, drawing criticism from U.S. lawmakers who condemned the program as a joke and a failure.\nThe top U.S. commander in the Middle East, Gen. Lloyd Austin, acknowledged that the program got off \"to a slow start\" and he told Congress that he looking at options that would best employ the moderate forces.\nOfficials have also said the new plan also scales back the number of rebels the U.S. expects to train from the initial 5,400 per year to a much smaller total. It also would streamline the vetting process designed to weed out terrorist infiltrators.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
