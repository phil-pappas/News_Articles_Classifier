We have to thank Petr Cech too, he had a fantastic game.\" \nDefending champion Barcelona remained in control of top spot in Group E as Ivan Rakitic scored both goals in a 2-0 win at BATE Borisov, while Roma came back from a 2-0 deficit in a 4-4 draw at Bayer Leverkusen in a topsy-turvy game. \nIn Group G, Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho complained about the referee after the Blues were held to a goalless draw at Dynamo Kiev. Porto tops the standings after a 2-0 defeat of Maccabi Tel-Aviv. \n\"The referee was weak and naive with the penalty,\" said Mourinho after his side was not given a penalty when Cesc Fabregas went down in the area. \"My first thoughts were that it looked like a spot-kick. I cannot understand what the referee behind the goal does, because he doesn't make a clear decision too.\" \nHere is a look at Tuesday's Champions League matches:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:58:28.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
