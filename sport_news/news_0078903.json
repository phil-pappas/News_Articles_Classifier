Shooting and everything, I don’t notice it any more,” Colborne said. \nThe benefit of missing the last few weeks is that Colborne’s left wrist, for which he had surgery in the off-season, had more time to heal. \n“It’s way better than it was,” Colborne reported. “Like I said when (the thumb injury) happened, that was the only silver lining, that gave more of a chance to get better. I’m shooting it way better than I was during training camp, so it’s made some improvements.” \nNot on the ice for Monday’s skate at WinSport was left-winger Micheal Ferland, who was at the facility. \nCoach Bob Hartley said Ferland missed the practice due to “maintenance” and suggested it wouldn’t prevent the winger from playing in the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:21:48.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
