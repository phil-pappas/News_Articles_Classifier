That showed the competition we have in this squad and that can only be good for the club. As a player you want to be on that pitch and in the starting XI. \n\"It is brilliant at the moment. The way Riyad has fed the ball through, I was clean through. \n\"Nathan's cross, you probably won't see me score that many headers but I have managed to get my head on it. \n\"I am oozing confidence but we just need to keep it going. It is nothing to do with me really. It is a team game and as long as Leicester keep getting the points that is all that matters. \n\"The team has put me in the position to score the goals and the whole squad has been a massive help to me. \n\"Hopefully, it will continue and we will keep getting the points week in and week out.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:21:40.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
