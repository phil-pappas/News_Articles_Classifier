The Buffalo Bills were hit with 17 penalties against the Giants on Sunday. On Friday, the NFL piled on a couple more.\nThe league smacked Bills defensive end Jerry Hughes with more than $30,000 in fines for his actions during the very chippy fourth quarter of the Giants’ 24-10 over the Bills. Hughes was fined $8,681 for unnecessary roughness – head-butting Giants rookie left tackle Ereck Flowers. And he was slammed for $23,152 for abusive language towards an official.\nThat’s the second fine for abusive language towards an official for Hughes in the last year. He was fined $22,050 for the same offense last November.\nAmazingly, that was the extent of the fines handed out to the Bills. Their linebacker, Preston Brown, who appeared to be one of the main instigators and drew both an unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, was not fined by the league.\n HERE.\nThere was also an unidentified Bills player in street clothes who threw a punch at Giants defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins during the game at the end of a play that ended up by the Bills bench. According to an NFL spokesman, “the matter has been addressed with the club (the Bills).”\nAs for the Giants, their lone known fine was the one reported earlier this week - $8,681 to receiver Odell Beckham for throwing a punch at Bills safety Duke Williams. Beckham said he “of course” will appeal the fine.\nRelated Stories IK Enemkpali, who punched Geno Smith, cut by Bills Buffalo Bills offensive line coach arrested for battery Rex Ryan wants to 'kick the s---' out of Jets on field Tags: jerry hughes , ereck flowers", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:08:26.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
