Yeah, he’s back. \nIn just his second race of the season, Murphy ran at the head of the pack the whole way and earned runner-up honors at the MVC Valley Division cross country meet Thursday at the Tuma Soccer Complex. \n“I felt great,” said Murphy, a junior at Linn-Mar. “With 800 meters to go, I made a move to open it up a little bit.” \nCedar Falls’ Isaac Smith won the race in 15:38. Murphy was next in 15:41, a personal best. \nThat in itself is impressive. But given what Murphy has endured this fall, “impressive” gives way to “remarkable.” \nSince an August workout, Murphy has battled a balky IT band in his left leg, which was still taped Thursday. The last six weeks has been a buffet of ice, physical therapy, massage, stretching, strengthening and light running. \nBut now, well, he’s back, man. \nCedar Falls captured the divisional title, placing all five scorers in the top 10 and scoring 30 points. Linn-Mar was second with 42, followed by Iowa City West (70) and Dubuque Senior (73). \nSmith and Murphy ran in a four-man pack with Linn-Mar’s Michael Mather and Cedar Falls’ Sam Schillinger most of the way. \n“It was a fast race,” Murphy said. “I think they said we were at 9:57 at the 2-mile mark.” \nIowa City West rolled to the girls’ crown, tallying 34 points. Linn-Mar was the runner-up with 54, followed by Cedar Falls (86). \nHannah Fusselman of Cedar Rapids Kennedy captured top honors in 18:50. \n“Most of the race, I was trying to draft. It was really windy out there,” said Fusselmann, a sophomore. “I’m overwhelmed. I didn’t think this was possible. I’m really happy with it.” \nTia Saunders led West’s title charge, finishing second in 18:59. Bailey Nock was fourth, Olivia Moore was sixth. \nLinn-Mar’s Maddie Mann and Cedar Rapids Jefferson’s Meredith Koenigsfeld were third and fifth, respectively. \nMVC VALLEY DIVISION CROSS COUNTRY MEET \nAt Tumas Soccer Complex \nGirls Results \nTeams — 1.
