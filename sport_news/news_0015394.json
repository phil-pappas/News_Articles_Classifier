His coach, Ed Cooley, suggested he go, too. Millions of dollars were one decision away.\nInstead, Dunn returned to school, never considering — or reconsidering — the alternative for a moment. \n“It was a great decision, I believe,” Dunn said after being named the conference’s preseason player of the year Wednesday at Big East Media Day. “I went with my heart, stuck to my gut and hopefully it turns out well.”\nOn track to graduate in the spring, the junior guard said he wanted to earn his degree to be a role model for his two younger sisters, but also felt he needed to come back because he wasn’t ready yet for the NBA, regardless of what agents and mock drafts insisted.\n“The humility with which he’s approached his career is really impressive,” Villanova coach Jay Wright said. “I know NBA guys are drooling over that.”\nDunn demonstrated an ability do everything last season, averaging 15.6 points, 7.5 assists (third in the nation), 5.5 rebounds and 2.7 steals (fifth in the nation), while sharing honors as the Big East’s best defensive player,. But the 6-foot-4 guard still rattled off a long list of things to improve upon, including working on a lower dribble, his shot and his decision-making.\nReally, nothing was good enough to him.\n“I’ve only had one full year under my belt as a college player,” Dunn said. “I need more experience. I need to learn the game a little bit more and develop my skills.”\nDespite a diminished supporting cast, Dunn said he hopes to win the Big East and return to the NCAA Tournament, but said his only real goal is to make his team better. Somehow, the clichés come off truthful, perhaps because of his appreciation for his place.\nWhen Dunn thinks back to his childhood in Virginia — of the incarceration of his mother, of not knowing where his next meal would come from — and thinks of what life is like for those he hasn’t seen since moving to New London, Conn., with his father, perspective appears — and doesn’t ever appear to leave.\n“I’ve gone through poverty, in what we call the projects,” Dunn said. “A lot of kids, it’s not that they don’t try but the situation they’re in some kids don’t have the parents to guide them to get education. Some kids have to help their family to give them money to pay bills and keep the lights on. … For me, I have my dad who helps me and I have my family. Why not just go get the education? No need for me to rush to go to the NBA.”\nEven dreams can wait.\n  big east ,  kris dunn ,  providence friars", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:18:39.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
