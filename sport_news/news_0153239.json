On Wednesday's SEC football teleconference, several of the league's other head coaches took time to pay tribute to the Head Ball Coach.\nHere's what they had to say:\nNick Saban, Alabama\n\"Everybody should know this guy is one of the best college football coaches over a long period of time. Winning at various programs, from Duke to Florida to South Carolina — not always in great situations, but always made those situations better. I think he's been really good for college football, and we're certainly going to miss him.\"\nGus Malzahn, Auburn\n\"His influence on me goes back to even high school coaching, wearing the visor. Since I've gotten to know him in college, he's been a mentor for me at times. I just want to tell him I appreciate everything he's done for me. Sad to him go. He's been great for our league.\"\nLes Miles, LSU\n\"The Ole Ball Coach was a great player and won at every school he was ever a coach at. He was a guy who had a big personality and one of those guys who made college football very entertaining. He'll be missed.\n\"He's always been very entertaining and tremendously competitive. Any time you can get any victory against him, you've earned it. I felt that way this past Saturday and in any of the other games where we lined up against each other.\"\nShawn Elliott, South Carolina (interim)\n\"He's just showed me 'don't cave into what everyone else wants from you' — be yourself. Just how he treats people, his X's and O's, really stand out. The personal approach to his family in life, and how well-received the family-type situation he has. It's meant a great deal. He's shaped my career, my thoughts, my goals. He's done so much for me.\"\nDerek Mason, Vanderbilt\n\"When you talk about coach Spurrier, you're talking about one of the best coaches to ever coach college football. An innovator, mentor, teacher, educator and a great player. He's touched every facet of what college football is.\"\nButch Jones, Tennessee\n\"He's truly a living legend. He's meant so much to the game of football. He's a true winner. He's a champion. And I've truly enjoyed our time together in the league. He's just meant so much to the SEC with what he's brought to the table. And I have a tremendous amount of respect for him and high regard. I grew up watching him, in his days coaching the (USFL's) Tampa Bay Bandits, and 'Bandit Ball.'\"\nBret Bielema, Arkansas\n\"I just want to send my best to coach Spurrier. Obviously, he's won a lot of football games, but he's done it the right way. A tremendous human being with great character. For me as a young coach 10 years ago to be able to get to know him a little bit and to be around him these last few years in the SEC, has been truly rewarding. We'll wish him the best as he moves forward.\"\nGary Pinkel, Missouri\n\"He's been tremendously successful at anything he's ever done. We played them in the Independence Bowl in 2005 and I've gotten to know him a little bit better the last few years. He's fun to have in meetings, because he says all the right things at the right and wrong time, and he was always concerned about student-athletes. That's what it always came back to 'is this the right thing for our student-athlete?' Whether it was academics or football or whatever. I deeply admire him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:06:51.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
