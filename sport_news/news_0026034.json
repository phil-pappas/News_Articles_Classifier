By ROB MAADDIAP Pro Football Writer \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - DeMarco Murray ran for 109 yards and a touchdown, Nolan Carroll returned one of Eli Manning's two interceptions for a score and the Philadelphia Eagles beat the New York Giants 27-7 Monday night. \nSam Bradford threw for 280 yards and a 32-yard TD pass to Riley Cooper, but had three interceptions to keep New York in the game. \nThe Eagles (3-3) have won two straight to move from last place in the NFC East into a tie for first with the Giants (3-3). The teams meet again in Week 17. \nNeither team looked sharp in front of a prime-time audience. They combined for seven turnovers and 21 penalties. \nThe Giants gave the Eagles first downs on a roughing-the-passer penalty and a running-into-the-kicker penalty to keep both of their TD drives going. \n__ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
