Jackson — set for Wednesday, Nov. 4 (NEED TO CHECK DATE), from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the Legacy Club, in the southwest corner of Union Station.\nOberman said he found it “ridiculous” that only seven people showed up last year at the single downtown budget hearing, at Metra headquarters. The Union Station location should encourage turnout, officials said. It also will be webcast live.\nThe 2016 fare increases, due to start Feb. 1, were calculated somewhat differently than last year’s and involve a flat amount added to each type of ticket, regardless of the zone for which it is purchased.\nAcross almost all types of tickets, riders closest to downtown would shoulder the biggest percent increases. The fare boosts range from 0 to 7.7 percent. For example:\n The most popular Metra ticket, a monthly one, would go up a flat $2.50, regardless of zone. That shakes out to a 2.7 percent increase for Zone A riders closest to downtown, who would pay $95.25 per ticket instead of $92.75. Those farthest away, in Zone M, would see only a .9 percent increase, with that ticket rising to $294.75 from $292.25.\n The second most popular ticket, for 10 rides, would rise a flat $1.75, with Zone A increasing 6 percent, to $31 from $29.25, and Zone M increasing 1.9 percent, to $94 from $92.25.\n One-way tickets would increase by a flat 25 cents.\n One-way reduced-fare tickets would see no change.\n Each 10-ride reduced-fare ticket would increase a flat 75 cents, regardless of zone.\n Each monthly reduced-fare ticket would increase $1.25, regardless of zone.\nOberman did not seem worried that riders closest to downtown facing the biggest percent increases might defect to the Chicago Transit Authority, although some threatened last year to do so.\n“There are people that ride Metra that don’t want to ride the CTA,’’ Oberman said.\nLast year, officials projected their 10.8 percent average fare hike could cause a 1.1 percent ridership loss and a 1.2 percent dip has materialized year to date, Metra spokesman Michael Gillis said.\nGiven next year’s far lower fare hike, officials are building only an .8 percent ridership loss into the 2016 budget, Gillis said.\nMetra was able to shrink its original 2016 fare increase projections due to $5.7 million in efficiencies, $19.4 million in lower fuel prices, and an expected increase of $19.6 million in Regional Transit Authority sales tax revenue, officials said.\nCK GRAF: Part of the fare increase will support $15.6 million in capital expense, as well as average raises (check) of nearly 3 percent for union and non-union employees.\nCK GRAF: “We’re not giving away money,’’ Oberman said. “If people get raises, it’s what’s necessary to keep a professional work force.”\nHowever, the budget comes with a caveat due to the current state budget stalemate in Springfield.\nMetra’s proposed 2016 budget assumes no changes in state funding, and does not reflect the $170 million in total RTA funding cuts Gov. Bruce Rauner packed in a proposed state budget that was never approved, said Metra CEO Don Orseno. Metra’s share of the RTA funding loss was estimated at one point at $20.8 million.\n“We’re saying we have faith this will work out,” Orseno said.\nBut if state funding shrinks, Metra would have to cut services, raise fares or impose a mix of both, officials said.\nFilling the $20.8 million hole with only fare increases would translate into a 6 percent fare revenue increase instead of 2 percent one, they said.\nAnd, on the capital side, if $356 million (check) in promised state capital dollars does not materialize, 2017’s projected 8.5 percent revenue (check) hike could be even higher, officials warned.\nSpringfield’s inability to pass a budget so far this year prompted Metra to withhold floating the first of four rounds of bond offerings, originally planned to start in 2015, to help fuel the overhaul of virtually its entire fleet, officials said.\nMetra doesn’t want to issue bonds until it knows for sure it can win one volume-discount bid for its rail and locomotive needs, Oberman said. Bidders might be reluctant to enter the fray, given the open question mark hanging over state funding, he said.\n“It’s very, very difficult to responsibly manage a billion-dollar business (like Metra) with all this uncertainty,’’ Oberman said. “It’s thrown off our ability to function.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:15:17.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
