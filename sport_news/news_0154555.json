Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, copyright 2015 An hour-long chase involving two law enforcement agencies Thursday night through downtown Twain Harte, Mi-Wuk Village and a Phoenix Lake-area neighborhood led to the arrest of a 29-year-old man who had four outstanding warrants. \nCalifornia Highway Patrol Sgt. Shawn Snyder said the incident began about 6:30 p.m. when Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Deputy Ashley Boujikian-Grossen attempted to pull over the driver of a 1993 Acura near Twain Harte on suspicion of speeding. \nThe driver sped off. Boujikian-Grossen lost sight of him. \nAbout 15 minutes later, after another deputy joined the search, they located the vehicle in Mi-Wuk Village, Snyder said, but lost sight of him again. \n“He had blacked out his lights,” he said. \nShortly after that, deputies saw the car going westbound on Highway 108 from Mi-Wuk Village. \nThe driver exited at Twain Harte and again drove through downtown Twain Harte. Highway Patrol officers took over on Twain Harte Drive, Snyder said. \nAfter driving through Crystal Falls and down Phoenix Lake Road, the driver entered Phoenix Lake Country Club Estates, then stopped the car and attempted to run across the Phoenix Lake Golf Course. He got about 25 yards before he put his hands behind his head and laid down on the ground. \nCHP officer Steve Warzee made the arrest. \nSnyder said he did not know how fast the cars were going during the pursuit. \nMatthew Dale Miller, 29, was arrested about 7:25 p.m. on Phoenix Lake Golf Course and charged with evading, driving under the influence and drug possession. \nMiller was not injured, but he was taken to Sonora Regional Medical Center for DUI testing. \nSnyder said Miller was driving with a suspended license and had multiple warrants out for his arrest for charges including drug possession, driving with a suspended license, failure to appear and domestic violence — all issued this year. Miller is in the Tuolumne County Jail on a no-bail hold.
