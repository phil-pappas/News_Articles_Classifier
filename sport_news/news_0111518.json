Not here, in the rink he oversaw as president of the Philadelphia Flyers . Not now, with warm-ups underway for the home opener and Luukko visiting for the first time in his new job, as executive chairman for the Florida Panthers . Not with so many passing back-slappers, hand-shakers, thumbs-uppers and—hang on, hold that thought. Here come two more.\n“Seanny!” Luukko says.\n“Peter! What’s going on? How’s it being back?”\n“Good, good.”\nThe new gig that coaxed Luukko back into the NHL, 14 months after his abrupt resignation, following more than a quarter-century as the COO of Comcast Spectacor, surprised many of those now seeking him out this Monday night. At the time, Luukko’s rationale involved cashing out from various ventures, investing in new ones and spending more time watching his two sons – Nick, a Flyers prospect currently in the ECHL, and Max, a defenseman playing on their affiliated junior team. His decision stunned them too, but soon Luukko was seeking their advice about this other project in Florida. They told him he should accept the offer, that missing their games was okay.\nNHL Video Florida Panthers 2015-16 preview by Jeremy Fuchs", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@Alex_Prewitt"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:07:18.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
