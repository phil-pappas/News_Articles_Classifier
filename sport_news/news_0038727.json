It paid off in a 6-3 win, improving Toronto’s record to 1-2-1 heading into the Phil Kessel game Saturday down the I-70 in Pittsburgh. \nBabcock could celebrate his first win, the Leafs marked as many regulation road goals as they’ve scored since last Oct. 12, James Reimer collected his 75th NHL win and Daniel Winnik had three assists. But centre Tyler Bozak missed part of the second period with a lower body injury and departed for good two shifts into the third. \nToronto also had to kill a tense two minutes of a Nick Spaling boarding minor midway through the third, ending with Leo Komarov breaking past the exhausted Columbus power play for the clincher past Bobrovsky. He added an empty netter. \nAfter falling behind 1-0, the Leafs pounced on the Jackets’ ongoing troubles in the middle period. \nJake Gardiner whipped the first goal by a Leaf defenceman past Bobrovsky, who had a clean look at it. James van Riemsdyk scored from long range on a partial screen and the tattered Jackets were simply out-worked to a loose puck that Nazem Kadri jammed in. \nThat flurry saw Gardiner get the first goal by a Leaf defenceman this season, Toronto take a lead for once and Shawn Matthias collect his first point as a Leaf. But there were also some strange sequences, in which Bozak was somehow hurt and David Clarkson come up wrestling with his former captain Dion Phaneuf, two of last year’s most highly paid Leafs. \nReimer made a couple of big stops during a power play that resulted from that minor scrap, but soon after lost sight of a puck that ended up on Nick Foligno’s stick, untouched on the other side of the cage. Scott Hartnell completed the comeback with Komarov in the box to start the third. \nColumbus coach Todd Richards sounded irritated in the morning, constantly having to answer for the failed expectations of a fast start amid talk that the booming goal cannon at Nationwide Arena will be aimed right at him soon. \n“I think we’re confident, because we know what type of group we have,” said captain Foligno. “But you don’t play your game, you’re no good to anybody.” \nThe Jackets did strike first. Spaling lost an own zone draw, the Jackets hustled to keep it in and it was downhill from there. Boone Jenner stretched his stick to get away from Gardiner’s check and ended up with a beautiful re-direct of Cam Atkinson through Reimer’s pads. The latter stopped xx shots, while Toronto peppered the Jackets with xx. \nlance.hornby@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:44:23.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
