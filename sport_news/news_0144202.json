There were emotional twists and turns, some heroic plays made by a wide range of players and enough mistakes to keep both fan bases scratching their heads.\nWhen it was over, the Broncos had themselves a 26–23 overtime victory, thanks to Brandon McManus ’s 36-yard field goal.\nThree thoughts on the outcome:\n1. Somehow, Denver is 6–0: Scratch that. It's not a mystery. The Broncos’ defense continue to be the single biggest determining factor in this team’s hot start, and that was the case again Sunday.\nThe Broncos did allow Cleveland’s offense to hang two touchdowns on the board, both coming on passes from Josh McCown to breakout star tight end Gary Barnidge . But they offset those moments with several key stops: Aqib Talib ’s pick-six to make it 10–0 early, an interception of McCown to force overtime and then, perhaps most impressive of all, a three-and-out in OT with Cleveland mere yards away from field-goal range.\nNFL Dan Campbell promised tougher, and Dolphins delivered vs. Titans by Chris Burke", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ChrisBurke_SI"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:25:41.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
