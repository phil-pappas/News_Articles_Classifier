(Ashley Landis/The Dallas Morning News ... more > By STEPHEN HAWKINS - Associated Press   \nQuarterback Seth Russell’s season is over for No. 2 Baylor. \nRussell will have surgery to repair damage to his cervical vertebra. The surgery was recommended after Russell saw a specialist Monday, two days after getting hurt late in the Bears’ 45-27 victory over Iowa State. \nThe typical recovery time is six months. \nRussell is the top-rated passer in the Bowl Subdivision, throwing for 2,104 yards with 29 touchdowns and six interceptions. He also ran for six scores for the NCAA’s top offense (686 total yards, 61 points a game). \nFreshman Jarrett Stidham will take over as the starter. He has played in every game so far, and has some extra time to prepare for his first start since the Bears (7-0) next play Nov. 5 at Kansas State. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:34.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
