Boston College's Tyler Rouse ran for no gain, and Jeff Smith spiked the ball as the clock hit :00. \nAfter a replay review, the referee confirmed the game was over. \n\"That's Football 101. It comes with experience,\" Demon Deacons linebacker Brandon Chubb said. \"We said that before the play: 'Don't get up. They have no timeouts. Slowly get up. Don't get up until someone pulls you up.'\" \nThe win snapped a two-game losing streak for Wake Forest (3-3, 1-2 ACC). The Eagles (3-3, 0-3) have lost three straight. \n\"I think going into the game that everybody thought this was going to be a shootout, whoever had the ball last was going to win the game,\" Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson said, joking before praising the defenses. \"Really a great, great defensive game. Both teams did everything they could to give the other team the game.\" \nThe Eagles also had a third-and-1 at the Wake Forest 8 with under two minutes left, but Troy Flutie fumbled on a sneak, the ball squirted out of the pile and defensive back Zach Dancel recovered. \nBoston College's Colton Lichtenberg missed two field-goal attempts - from 26 and 31 yards. \nWeaver missed on a 43-yard attempt in the opening half. \nThe Eagles, who piled up easy wins over a pair of FCS schools in their first two games, came in ranked No. 1 among FBS schools with the fewest yards allowed. The Demon Deacons entered the game ranked 20th. \nThe Demon Deacons collected just 142 total yards. Boston College had 270. \nWake Forest's defense came into the game without collecting a turnover. \n\"Once you get that first turnover, there's something about it, maybe it's an icebreaker,\" Chubb said. \"They just start coming.\" \nBC fumbled four times, losing three, and had an interception. \nEagles coach Steve Addazio wanted to take one run before changing kickers. \n\"Could we have thrown the ball? Absolutely, but, you know, with our outfit right now, that was the right logic, the right judgement and that I stand by completely,\" he said. \"It didn't pan out. It didn't work out, so it's on me. That's life. I'm a big boy, got to handle it and we'll move forward.\" \nEarly in the third, Chubb recovered Jordan Gowins' fumble at the Eagles 5. After losing two yards, the Demon Deacons settled for Weaver's decisive field goal. \nBoston College drove deep into Wake Forest territory, helped by two unsportsmanlike penalties. But Lichtenberg was wide left on his 26-yard attempt and Addazio looked to the sky in disbelief. \nLichtenberg missed his 31-yarder in the final minute of the opening quarter, nailing the right upright. \nIt was only fitting that Wake Forest's punter Alex Kinal set a conference record for most career yards during a scoreless opening half. \nThe Eagles had consecutive false start penalties before getting whistled for delay of game after their first two offensive plays. \nWeaver was wide right on his 43-yard try midway into the second. He was 8 of 10 on the season before the miss. \nThe teams traded interceptions about a minute apart near midfield early in the second, but both sides failed to get into field-goal range. \nWake Forest is at North Carolina next week. The Eagles travel to No. 6 Clemson. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
