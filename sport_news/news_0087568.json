Alabama's aggressive defense then recorded two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the win and the Crimson Tide's national championship hopes. Alabama (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) got plenty of help, with Tennessee (3-4, 1-3) missing three long field goal attempts. The Vols took the lead on Jalen Hurd's 12-yard scoring run with 5:49 left. Alabama overwhelmed the 15-point underdogs from there. (2) Baylor 45 Iowa St. 27 WACO, Texas — Shock Linwood ran for 171 yards with a touchdown, and caught a pass for another score as Baylor beat Iowa State for its FBS-best 20th consecutive home win while ending another impressive streak. Baylor (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) finished the game without quarterback Seth Russell, who sustained a fracture in one of the bones in his neck on a 4-yard run without about 5 1/2 minutes left. The fracture was revealed on postgame X-rays and a CT scan. He will see a specialist next week. (6) Clemson 58 Miami (Fla.) 0 MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Clemson handed Miami its worst defeat in the program's 90-year history to remain unbeaten. Deshaun Watson threw for a touchdown and ran for another, while Wayne Gallman rushed for 118 yards and a touchdown for the Tigers (7-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). Stacy Coley had eight catches for 54 yards for Miami (4-3, 1-2), in a game that could doom whatever chance Hurricanes coach Al Golden had of keeping his job much longer. (7) Michigan St. 52 Indiana 26 EAST LANSING, Mich. — Connor Cook threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns, and Michigan State remained undefeated with a win over Indiana. Cook fell just short of the school record of 400 yards passing, set by Bill Burke in 1999 against Michigan. The Spartans (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) never trailed in the second half of this one, but it was touch and go until Cook found R.J. Shelton for a 10-yard touchdown pass with 4:57 remaining to give Michigan State a 12-point lead. (14) Oklahoma St. 58 Kansas 10 STILLWATER, Okla. — Backup quarterback J.W. Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more to help Oklahoma State defeat Kansas, hours after a fatal crash near the stadium during the school's homecoming festivities. Three people were killed and dozens injured when a woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed a car into a crowd at the homecoming parade. Oklahoma State considered postponing the game, but in the end, opted to go ahead with it. Mason Rudolph completed 20 of 26 passes for 305 yards and had a touchdown for Oklahoma State (7-0, 4-0 Big 12). Page 2 of 2 - (17) Oklahoma 63 Texas Tech 27 NORMAN, Okla. — Samaje Perine ran for 201 yards and four touchdowns and helped quarterback Baker Mayfield top his old team as Oklahoma defeated Texas Tech. Mayfield transferred from Tech after his freshman season in 2013 and had to sit out last year because the school blocked his ability to play right away. Mayfield completed 15 of 22 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns. Joe Mixon ran for 154 yards and two scores, and the Sooners (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) ran for 405 yards. (19) Toledo 58 UMass 35 FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Phillip Ely recovered from a poor start and threw four of his five touchdown passes in the second half as Toledo stormed back from an 18-point deficit for a win over Massachusetts. Ely was intercepted three times in the first half, but the Rockets (7-0, 4-0 MAC), and are off to their best start since 1997. He completed 26 of 47 passes for 355 yards. (21) Houston 59 UCF 10 ORLANDO, Fla. — Kenneth Farrow ran for 167 yards and three touchdowns and Houston remained undefeated with a victory over winless Central Florida. The Cougars (7-0, 4-0 AAC) scored 24 points in a mid-game span of 3 1/2 minutes and won for the fifth time by 21 points or more. (23) Duke 45 Virginia Tech 43 (4 OT) BLACKSBURG, Va. — Thomas Sirk threw four touchdown passes and ran for a 2-point conversion in the fourth overtime to lift Duke past Virginia Tech. Sirk hit Erich Schneider with a 25-yard scoring pass on the first play of the fourth overtime, after the Hokies had scored and missed the mandatory 2-point attempt. Sirk rolled right and cut upfield, giving the Blue Devils (6-1, 3-0) the victory in the longest game in Atlantic Coast Conference history. (25) Pittsburgh 23 Syracuse 20 SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Chris Blewitt kicked a 25-yard field goal as time expired to lift Pittsburgh over Syracuse. The Panthers (6-1, 4-0 ACC) have now won four of five on the road, with their only loss at Iowa on a 57-yard field goal on the final play of the game. Qadree Ollison ran for 98 yards and two touchdowns for the Panthers.
