Freshmen Eli Williams scored three touchdowns to lead Dayton’s scoring. “This was the most points (40) we’ve scored so far this season, and we had our different players score TDs,” Bulldogs coach Jerry Dedloff said. “It was nice to finally see the team move the ball on offense like I knew we could. We have been preaching to our running backs all season to use their speed to get the ball to the outside, for some reason they always want to cut back into the teeth of the defense. “Tonight we had four different backs (Williams, Tristen Willis, Jeff Tate and Tanner Bren) make the corner for big TD runs,” he said. “I was proud of the way our guys continued to battle even though we were down.” Dayton quarterback Bren scored Dayton’s only first-half points on a 16-yard QB option. After a scoreless third quarter, the Bulldogs got on the boards with Williams’ touchdown runs of 36, 45 and 19 yards, respectively, and Willis had a 24-yard TD run. Dayton used a little razzle-dazzle for its final points, with Bren finding Kobie Sunderland-Herrin on a pass, and then Sunderland-Herrn hit Tate for the scoring strike. “This was the second time we played Colton this season, and we knew they would come out throwing the ball,” Dedloff said. “The score may not reflect it very well, but we did a much better job of covering their receivers in this game than we did the first time we played them. Colton does a good job with the few athletic players they have. We put our fastest guys covering their fastest receivers, and we managed to cover them better this time. “Our defensive line and linebackers did a good job of putting pressure on their QB (Carter Dahmen),” he said. “Carter did a good job of finding the open receiver and he was able to scramble out of the pocket when the receivers were covered to kept drives alive, and this allowed Colton to score on nearly every possession in the first half. “We moved the ball effectively in the first half, but had four drives stall on Colton’s end of the field mostly from poor execution or penalties at critical times,” Dedloff said. “Tanner ran an option QB keeper in the first half for a TD that was called back because of a hold, and another big play was called back because one of our trips guy (Sunderland-Herrin) was covered. We’ve run that same trips set at least 50 times this season and never had it flagged until now, and we ran it several more times in this game and it wasn’t flagged again, so it was unfortunate timing for us. “We just have to continue to work on being more disciplined.” The Bulldogs did convert all of their 2-point conversion tries, and the special teams had a successful onsides kick recovery that led to one of Dayton’s fourth-quarter scores. The injury bug did hit Dayton once again, with Joseph Chapman leaving with a concussion, and Colton Johnson with a shoulder injury. Chapman is expected to miss at least two games, and Johnson’s season is over. “We are slowly improving and the team continues to stay positive,” Dedloff said. “We face St. John-Enidcott this coming Friday at St. John. One of us will come out of that game with our first win of the season.” No further stats were available.
