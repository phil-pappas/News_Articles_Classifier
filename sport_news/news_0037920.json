Adam le Fondre \n“While most of the time you will get that decision I am pleased that in the end it wasn’t crucial.” \nLe Fondre impressed up front alongside Afobe in what was his fourth league start for the club. \nHe has two goals to his name so far and insisted he was ‘getting there’ in terms of match sharpness. \n“Benik is a really good player and I have got on the same wavelength as him,” Le Fondre added. “It seems to be working really well with him in the ‘10’ and me in the ‘nine’ and it’s a good partnership developing and we are enjoying playing together.
