But the Silver Screen takes howls at the moon just as loudly as any werewolf featured flim. \"Goosebumps\" runs those kind of howls, and herded also with a rioutous flash mob of monsters the Jack Black starring movie led the pack of highest earners concluding Oct. 16 to 18s box office, according to Box Office Mojo .\n1st place grossing $23.6 million. / At New York's premiere of \"Goosebumps\" author R.L.

McCormack/Getty Images It was a beast of a transformation from a prior weekend's out-of-this-world owning the Top 5 to an adaptation of the popular book series' written by author R.L. Stine.\nBecause on the other side of the moon and over the Oct. 16th weekend \"The Martian\" was able to maintain its box office orbit for an uninterrupted back-to-back first slatings. At a trajectory along its previous high earnings, the Matt Damon starring film was diverted to 2nd place.\nOpening gross for Sony Pictures' \"Goosebumps\" just barely outranked \"The Martian\" with a best earnings of $23.6 million. Twentieth Century Fox's all-star ensemble of space travel and the Red Planet gilded its 3-weeks nationwide run at $21.3 million gross.\nBut the Mars-oriented drama falls outside what the Neverland origins movie of \"Pan\" couldn't attain to a span of descending out of the Top 5, but remaining in the ten best over Oct. 16s three-day. \"Pan\" grossed $5.8 million in its dueling bid that only reached 6th place.\nThe brace of latest peaking 5 movies shows how near evenly spaced three new films splayed across the upper slates.\nBut it's the Tom Hanks starring \"Bridge of Spies\" that will be joining \"Jurassic World\" with a 2015 of Spielberg-oriented premieres: Tom Hanks newest film and re-teaming with director Stephen Spielberg doles the second back in Cold War-days spy-drama in 2015. \"Bridge of Spies\" took in $15.3 million and the 3rd spotting tier.\nMeanwhile another well-respected and fan-followed director in Guillermo del Toro saw his most recent film since \"Pacific Rim\" open at 4th place. \"Crimson Peak\" marks del Toro's return to horror fare much to the delight of fans spanning from \"The Devil's Backbone\" (2001) or \"Pan's Labrynth\" (2006). Del Toro's current horror-thriller with Universal Pictures was able to gross $13.1 million.\nIn comparison, the Spanish filmmaker's 2014 giant monsters hit where man-made giant robots hit back spots \"Crimson Peak\" being del Toro's second-highest of openers in his directing career , with the Jaeger robots versus Kaiju invaders blockbuster marking his overall best at $37.2 million. And his contribution to building production torque towards comic book movies becoming the zeitgeist action genre in \"Blade II\" lists for 3rd at a $32.5 million opening accumulation.\nBack at the now-standing box office bracket, another chockful monster role film bookends not only the Top 5 but a complement of Halloween appropos. It's the animated film by Sony \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" that reserves $12.6 million at its fourth week in theaters\nBut for Fall and 2015 it's another benchmark that \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" and \"The Martian\" indent. Out of Fall's showcasing both the animated monster sequel and the colonizing space-drama placed well amidst 2015s earners. Not far from a Top 10 where Marvel has a movie duo and \"Furios 7\" solidified its franchise charm holding at 4th, \"The Martian\" places sixteenth with $145.1 million; just under the another blockbuster franchise's jumpstarted spike in \"Mad Max: Fury Road\". Tom Hardy takes on the role of Mad Max within an installment thiry-years past the premiere for 1985's \"Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome\". \"The Martian\" has the odds favor trading ranks with the latter fifteenth best 2015 film, a $145.1 million distant rear-view position against \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" grossing of $153.6 million. An amount that sets a second overtaking potential by the $137.4 million grossed by seventeenth ranking \"Hotel Transylvania 2\".\nAnd the Top 5 film firmaments outlining 2015 ? From a kick-off at first place this year's respective ranking films are: \"Jurasssic World\", \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\", \"Inside Out\", \" Furious 7 \" and \"Minions\".", "external_links": ["http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2015&p=.htm", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Director&id=guillermodeltoro.htm"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:23:37.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
