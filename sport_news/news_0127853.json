They have a great tradition up there.\"\nPrior to the visit, Kelley was excited about Oregon's pursuit and was anxious to learn more about the school.\n\"I'm surprised and I'm very stoked about it,\" he told The Oregonian/OregonLive . \"I like everything ‚Äì the atmosphere up there seems great, it seems like they have great fans and I really like their coaching staff with Scott Frost. I just think it's an amazing school.\"\nThe 6-foot-2, 170-pound quarterback, out of Basha High School (Chandler, Arizona), is rated as the No. 3 pro-style signal-caller in the country by 247Sports , behind only Tennessee commit Hunter Johnson and Georgia pledge Bailey Hockman.\nESPN rates Kelley as the No. 35 prospect in the nation , nearly 30 spots higher than 247Sports, and has him behind Hockman and Texas A&M pledge Tate Martell.\nAdding to the intrigue in the class of 2017 has been the Oregon coaching staff's decision to wait on offering Martell and Marcus Mariota disciple Tua Tagovailoa , both of whom expressed early interest in the Ducks.\nInstead, Oregon's first quarterback offer went to Kelley, making him a marquee player to watch in the 2017 recruiting cycle.\nAmazing visit this weekend in Oregon, I'd like to thank all the coaches for having my family and meüê£üê• #WTD #GoDucks pic.twitter.com/352rZzyUty\n‚Äî ‚ö°Ô∏èRK‚ö°Ô∏è (@Ryankelley_14) October 13, 2015\nJunior mid-season:\nSophomore season:\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTD?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Ryankelley_14/status/653738763101704192", "http://247sports.com/Season/2017-Football/CompositeRecruitRankings?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool&Position=PRO", "http://247sports.com/Player/Ryan-Kelley-59384", "http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/playerrankings/_/position/quarterback-pocket-passer/class/2017/view/position", "https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoDucks?src=hash", "http://t.co/352rZzyUty"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:05:14.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
