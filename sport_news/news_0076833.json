LOUIS \nComing off their open week, the St. Louis Rams are feeling rejuvenated. Besides the rest, it was a chance to reset goals and home in on areas for improvement. \n“Definitely,” wide receiver Kenny Britt said. “Everybody’s focusing and getting back to what we have to do, and to our details so we can go out there and start fast.” \nThere’s good reason for optimism, too. Though they’re 2-3, the Rams are very much alive in the muddled NFC West, with Arizona the lone team above .500, and both the Cardinals and Seattle coming off losses. \nThe latter made it an enjoyable weekend for coach Jeff Fisher, plus Seattle and San Francisco played on Thursday night. \n“We got some help,” Fisher said. \nThe schedule seems to provide a breather, too. After going 1-2 in three consecutive games against teams with winning records, the Rams have just three opponents with winning records the rest of the way. \nThey know they’ve got to make some of their own breaks, too, starting today with Cleveland (2-4). \nThe Browns have some catching up to do after facing just two teams with winning records in the first six. However, they had the unbeaten Broncos on the ropes last week before losing in overtime. \n“We’re 2-4 and we own that,” coach Mike Pettine said. “There is some confidence because we know that we’re close. That’s what makes it all the more frustrating.” \nThings to watch for in Browns-Rams: \nDEAD LAST \nThe Browns spent the offseason addressing the league’s worst rushing defense. It hasn’t improved. In fact, it’s gotten worse. They remain No. 32 against the run, giving up 149.8 yards per game — up from 141.6 last season. \nThe defense has been plagued by schematic breakdowns and poor tackling, allowing opponents to break off long runs and chunk yardage. Rookie Danny Shelton was brought in to help fix the problem, but the No. 12 overall pick hasn’t performed up to expectations. He said adjusting to the pro game has been a major challenge. \n“These guys are just more experienced, these guys are quicker, so you’ve got to be able to play up to their level,” he said. “It’s not like in college, where you’re setting the level, it’s an easy job. Every day you’re going up against a guy who’s fighting for a paycheck just like you are.” \nBOWE’S DOUGH \nWide receiver Dwayne Bowe has not caught a pass this season, hardly the return Cleveland was looking for when it signed him to a two-year, $12.5 million contact in March. The 31-year-old Bowe has been inactive four times and Pettine indicated the veteran is at the bottom of the depth chart.
