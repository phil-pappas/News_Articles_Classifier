It was a recognition that the players' efforts had been appreciated. \n\"That appreciation and goodwill has also been apparent in the messages of support I have received this week, from emails and letters to chats in the street.\" \nSFA chief executive Stewart Regan added: \"The board of the Scottish FA has been consistent in our belief that Gordon should continue the good work that has been apparent in many performances and results throughout the previous campaign. \n\"Similarly, the supporters and the players have been overwhelming in their view that Gordon is the national coach to lead us into the World Cup qualifying campaign. \n\"The mutual respect and stability that exists is essential to our future success and we all look forward to planning for Russia 2018.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:14:20.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
