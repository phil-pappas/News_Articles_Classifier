Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports The NFL and its teams sport pink to raise breast cancer awareness throughout October. But Cameron Heyward is dealing with some questionable repercussions for showing his support.\nAdChoices The Steelers defensive end was fined Wednesday for displaying the message \"Iron Head\" on his eye black in Monday's game against the Chargers as a tribute to his father Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward, who played 11 seasons in the NFL as a fullback but died of bone cancer at the young age of 39. Cameron was only 17 at the time of his passing.\nCASH: DeAngelo Williams' stiff-arm by NFL unncessary | NFL making strides on domestic violence\nGot fined for honoring my Dad who bravely fought cancer on my eye black. #Nevergiveup #CancerSucks pic.twitter.com/RTx988ijG9\n— Cam Heyward (@CamHeyward) October 14, 2015\nAccording to NFL Network , Heyward has been fined $5,787 for the display, which is the standard fine for the first violation of the league's uniform policy against \"personal messages.\"\nHeyward's fine comes one day after it was reported the league refused to allow his teammate, running back DeAngelo Williams, to wear pink all season to honor his mother, who died of breast cancer last year, and further support awareness of the disease. His mother's four sisters also fought breast cancer and all died from the disease by 2011.\nThe controversial rulings will only fuel criticism toward the league's notoriously strict uniform policies and \"Pink October\" campaign.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-13/deangelo-williams-pink-hair-breast-cancer-awareness-uniforms-steelers-nfl-fine", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nevergiveup?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/CancerSucks?src=hash", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-13/deangelo-williams-nfl-breast-cancer-request-denied-wear-pink-rule", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-13/nfl-domestic-violence-awareness-month-response-league-progress-players-greg-hardy-jerry-jones-bradshaw", "https://twitter.com/Rand_Getlin/status/654343327303598080", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "https://twitter.com/CamHeyward/status/654340648053510144", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://t.co/RTx988ijG9"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:35:51.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
