(Matt Hinshaw/The Daily Courier) Doug Cook The Daily Courier Bradshaw Mountain High's swimming team registered a confidence-boosting sweep of Prescott in the rivals' annual dual meet Thursday, Oct. 15, as the Bears' boys won handily and their girls recorded a narrow victory.At the Prescott YMCA 's indoor pool, Bradshaw's boys defeated Prescott, 95-75, while its girls edged the Badgers, 85-84. The Bears' girls' squad won by the same margin as it did in 2014.Veteran Bradshaw coach Patti Eller said this may have been the first time in the rivalry's lengthy history that both the Bears' boys' and girls' teams defeated Prescott in the same year.\"Usually we will beat the (Prescott) boys or the girls, but not both,\" an ecstatic Eller said. \"Our kids are very dedicated, and nobody misses practice. Our captains are great leaders, and everyone wants to do well.\" On the girls' side, Mackenzie Donovan and Rachel Campbell led Bradshaw to the victory. Donovan won the 200 free in 2 minutes, 13.16 seconds, and the 500 free in 6:05.80. Campbell placed first in the 100 free in 1:01.23.Prescott was guided by senior captain Raphael Temple, who finished first in the 100 butterfly with a new school-record time of 1 minute and 4.1 seconds. The previous record had stood since 2009, longtime PHS coach Brigid Bunch said. Temple also won the 100 backstroke in 1:04.3.\"It was a very exciting meet with many close races,\" Bunch said. \"I was so proud of my team. Many personal bests were attained at this meet. It's great to see the students beaming with pride at the end of good race. We had fun hosting BMHS. There are many friendships between the two teams and many hugs were given.\" Other Badgers' girls who stood out included freshman Lacey Ingallina, who won the 100 breast in 1:22.4 and the 200 individual medley in 2:35.1, and sophomore Trinity Lazzell, who placed second in the 50 free (30 seconds flat) and the 100 free (1:07.7).In the girls' relays, Prescott's 200 medley team of sophomore Brea Christopherson, Ingallina, Temple and Lazzell was victorious in 2:05.73.On the boys' side, Bradshaw co-captain Mako Bennett led his squad, winning the 200 free in 2:02 and the 500 free in 5:44. Parker Bennett, Mako's brother, took first in the 200 individual medley (2:24.64).Other Bears who posted victories included Johnny Ramirez in the 50 free (25 seconds flat) and David Dennis in the 100 breast (1:20.28). In the relays, the 200 free team of Ramirez, Dennis and the Bennett brothers won in 1:44.33, and the 400 free squad of Noah Rohrbough, Kevin Moore and the Bennett brothers finished first in 3:42.70.For Prescott's boys, senior standout Jaxton Peterson paced the Badgers, winning the 100 fly in 56.9 seconds and the 100 back in 1:01.7. Sophomore Paul Kinach was first in the 100 free (57.8 seconds) and runner-up in the 50 free (25.1). Aiding in the effort was sophomore Tate Bassett, who took second in the 200 individual medley in 2:30.7, and sophomore Anders Madsen, a first-year swimmer who was second in the 100 breast (1:25.9).In the boys' relays, Prescott's 200 medley team of Bassett, Kinach, freshman Isaiah Kaitschuck and Peterson won with a time of 1:56.3.Arguably the race of the afternoon came in the 400 medley relay, which was decided in the final stretch of the last leg, as Bradshaw's Mako Bennett edged Peterson. The Bears' time of 3:42.7 was just two-tenths of a second faster than the Badgers' 3:42.9.The 2015 regular season is rapidly coming to a close, as Prescott has only two meets remaining on its schedule before the Division II state championships Nov. 6 and 7 at Skyline Aquatic Center in Mesa.First up, the Badgers will hit the road to take on Flagstaff and Mingus Union at 4 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 22. They will then head to the Craig Cummins Invitational Saturday, Oct. 24, at Skyline Aquatic Center for their final meet before state.Bunch said her team will send two individual swimmers, Temple and Peterson, to state. Temple has already qualified in the 100 back and 100 fly. Peterson has qualified in the 50 free and the 100 back.However, while Peterson will compete in the 100 back at state, Bunch said he wants to swim in the 100 fly instead of the 50 free because the 50 free and 100 back are swum consecutively at the meet. Peterson has yet to qualify for the 100 fly.Bunch added that she also would like to see one of her girls' relay teams solidify a postseason spot in the coming week.The Bears will return to the pool at 4 p.m. Oct. 21, when they face Dysart and Goldwater for a tri-meet at Surprise Aquatic Center.Bradshaw will finish the regular season at 4 p.m. Oct. 27, when the squad hosts Flagstaff and Mingus at Mountain Valley Splash in Prescott Valley. The D-II state meet follows for the Bears as well on Nov. 6 and 7 in Mesa.Eller said Mako Bennett has already qualified for state in five events, including the 50, 100 and 200 free, and the 100 fly. Bradshaw also has three provisional qualifiers in Donovan (500 free, 200 free, 100 back) and Lexi Walker (100 fly). Parker Bennett is a possibility in the 200 IM, Eller added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:37:38.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
