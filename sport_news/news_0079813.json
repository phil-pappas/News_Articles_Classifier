The shift is expected to happen overnight Wednesday, with two lanes of southbound traffic moved east to the new roadway by early Thursday, the release said.\nThe move means both southbound and northbound traffic on I-65 – two lanes of traffic in each direction – will be using new lanes of I-65 North from Browns Station Way to the Kennedy Bridge. The shift means the split configuration, in place on I-65 South since last October, will be coming to an end.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nBridge work having desired impact of spurring development, especially in Southern Indiana\nNorthbound traffic started using the new lanes of I-65 this summer. Significant work had to be completed in the median, including demolition work and installing barrier wall, to move southbound traffic to its new position.\nThe traffic switch will give crews the room they need to build new lanes of I-65 South that will connect to the revamped Kennedy Bridge. Demolition of the old lanes of I-65 South will begin immediately. The process of building new roadway will continue through most of 2016.\nI-65 North and I-65 South will continue to be reduced from three through lanes of traffic to two from the Kennedy Bridge to Brown’s Station Way. The lane reductions extend for nearly 1 ½ miles and are expected to continue through late 2016, when the project nears completion.\nBoth directions of I-65 traffic had been using the southbound lanes of I-65 since early October 2014. That had allowed crews to demolish the old lanes of I-65 North and build new roadway to connect with the new cable-stayed bridge. The new bridge is expected to open to two-way traffic by January.\nThe new Downtown bridge will eventually carry six lanes of northbound traffic and the Kennedy Bridge will carry six lanes of southbound traffic. The project is scheduled for completion in December 2016.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nProgress on bridges project applauded\nThe highway officials and Downtown Crossing crews outlined this schedule:\n•In mid-October, traffic from the 10th Street ramp in Southern Indiana to I-65 South will move over to a new roadway (new lanes of I-65 NB).\n•In mid-November, the ramp from U.S. 31 South to Court Avenue – providing direct access to the Clark Memorial Bridge – will reopen to traffic.\n•Late this year, the date is uncertain, the flyover ramp from U.S. 31 North to I-65 North is scheduled to open to traffic, allowing drivers crossing the Clark Bridge direct access to I-65 North.\nFind more information on the Ohio River Bridges Project at www.kyinbridges.com .\nSign up for the free CJ Indiana newsletter\nReporter Sheldon S.
