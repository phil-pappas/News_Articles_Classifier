That should improve now that he's another week removed from the strained hamstring he suffered Sept. 20. The Bears are once again depleted at receiver, though, with Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) facing his fourth straight absence and Eddie Royal (ankle) missing practice time. Cornerback Sean Smith returned from suspension last Sunday to lift the Chiefs' maligned secondary. First-round rookie cornerback Marcus Peters moves fluidly and contests throws.\nON THE GROUND\nBears offense 11th, Chiefs defense 14th\nThe Bears offensive-line depth will be tested by a powerful Chiefs front. The center position is in flux because of Will Montgomery's season-ending broken left leg. Third-round rookie Hroniss Grasu struggled to consistently anchor in the preseason, but he has added more than 10 pounds and feels capable of controlling defensive linemen. Charles Leno will start at left tackle because Jermon Bushrod (concussion/shoulder) is still out. Chiefs nose tackle Jaye Howard is having a breakout season, using good hand technique and power to disrupt opponents' running games.\nBears 26th in total offense, 28th in points scored\nChiefs 29th in total defense, T-31st in points allowed\nBears on defense\nIN THE AIR\nNFL ranks: Chiefs offense 13th , Bears defense 4th\nQuarterback Alex Smith has been sacked 19 times, most in the NFL. Right tackle Eric Fisher, the No. 1 pick in 2013, has been inconsistent with his technique. The Bears must respect receiver Jeremy Maclin's speed, but no other Chiefs receiver has more than six catches. Tight end Travis Kelce is a rugged runner after the catch. Bears lineman Jarvis Jenkins has earned playing time on third down because of his high motor and strong hands rushing the passer.\nON THE GROUND\nChiefs offense 15th , Bears defense 24th\nThe Chiefs offense runs through Jamaal Charles, whose agility and speed make him one of the best running backs in the league. \"Even for a smaller guy, he still plays with good power and strength,\" Bears coach John Fox said. Nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff (left ankle) expects to make his season debut. He brings toughness and savvy to a line that limited Raiders running backs to a 3.4-yard average last Sunday. The Bears will be inexperienced at safety no matter who starts in place of Antrel Rolle (right ankle).\nChiefs 14th in total offense, 10th in points scored\nBears 7th in total defense, T-31st in points allowed\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Kansas City Chiefs Oakland Raiders Will Montgomery Jay Cutler Sean Smith Jermon Bushrod", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619161a/turbine/ct-matchups-bears-preview-spt-1011-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-10T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:21:27.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
