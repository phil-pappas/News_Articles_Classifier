Barrett celebrates his touchdown run with Dontre Wilson in Saturday night's win over Penn State. (Photo: James Lang-USA TODAY Sports) \nJoe Thomas (or is it Tebow?) Barrett probably needed GPS to find his way to the post-game interview room in the southeast tower of Ohio Stadium, it had been that long since he met with the media. \nIncredulously, finding his way back into Ohio State's starting lineup — even after accounting for four touchdowns in Saturday's 38-10 win over Penn State — might require something more, like divine guidance. \nOpting not to name his starting quarterback in the afterglow, Urban Meyer said, \"Let me evaluate it.\" \nThat should take all of one minute and 17 seconds. \nThat's how long it took Barrett to find the end zone after starter Cardale Jones struggled mightily in OSU's scoreless first quarter. If he wasn't throwing high he was throwing wide, leading the Buckeyes to one first down on their first three series. \nIt was easy to imagine OSU's marketing geniuses in a state of panic as their \"Dark Night in the Shoe\" campaign to mark the unveiling of all-black uniforms looked like it might backfire. Lose that game, a perfect season, probably a bid to repeat as national champion and that slogan suddenly takes a nasty turn. OSU fans would be trashing their commemorative T-shirts — those that Penn State fans didn't gobble up. \nBut Barrett saved the day, or night, just as he did last year on a bum knee in a double overtime victory at Penn State. Meyer has often credited that win with kick-starting Ohio State's drive to the national title. \nInexplicably, Meyer stuck to his rotation, with Jones starting each series and Barrett coming in as a red zone specialist, until deep into the third quarter after two ugly second-half drives where Jones had the Buckeyes shifting into reverse. \nWith 3:18 left in the quarter, and Penn State still within striking distance at 21-10, let the record state that Barrett — a 2014 Heisman finalist before getting hurt — started a series. That led to a field goal and then the Buckeyes put the game out of reach as Barrett piloted an eight-play, 85-yard drive, capped by his Tim Tebow-esque 5-yard jump pass to Braxton Miller. \nOhio State quarterback J.T.

(Photo: Greg Bartram-USA TODAY Sports) \nIt was nice to see Meyer dust off one of his favorite plays from taking the Florida Gators to two national championships. It would be nicer to know that he saw the light on this dark night when it comes to his quarterbacks and plans to dust off the \"starter\" label so gloriously affixed to Barrett last season when he set 19 school or Big Ten records. \nBut will he? \nJones stayed on the sidelines after getting benched in the third quarter and Barrett finished with a stat line that looked like this: 4-of-4 passing for 30 yards and two touchdowns; 102 yards rushing and two TDs on 11 carries. \nLargely because of him, the Buckeyes are 12-for-12 in red zone opportunities the last two games, including 11 touchdowns. Ten of those drives were finished by Barrett, who scored himself five times and threw two TDs. \nAnd, yet, Meyer won't commit to him as a starter? \nWhen asked to weigh in — and kudos to offensive coordinator Ed Warinner for walking into that line of fire — he basically parroted the head coach. \n\"I don't anticipate any changes,\" he said. \nWhaaaat? \n\"There's a reason why we had Cardale starting,\" Warinner said, \"and we just have to assess where we are right now.\" \nI'm sorry, what was that reason again? For magically filling the breach when Barrett got hurt and leading the Buckeyes through a three-game gauntlet to the national title? That was 10 months and seven games ago and only once, in the win over hapless Maryland, has Jones looked like that quarterback. \nTurn the page, Urban, turn the page. \nYou want to give a man with three national title rings the benefit of a doubt. He sees the quarterbacks in practice every day. But you would need to suspend belief to think that Jones is playing the position better than Barrett. Meyer has to know his credibility is in jeopardy of taking a major hit. \nWarinner admitted that game performance carries more weight than practice performance in evaluations. Do he and Meyer even need to review the film? Yeah, it was dark in the Shoe, but not that dark. \n\"(Offensive tackle) Taylor Decker gets evaluated on game performance more than practice,\" Warinner said. \"That's everybody. We'll cross that bridge (with the quarterbacks) tomorrow (Sunday), think about where we are and what we need to do moving forward.\" \nIdeally, Barrett would be on the other side of the bridge, demanding the keys to the ignition. Unfortunately, he's not as demanding as your garden variety NFL wide receiver. \n\"It's Coach Meyer's call,\" he said. \"Whether I'm going in in the red zone or starting, I don't think it really matters. When I'm in there, I'm just trying the best I can to help the team.win. I control what I can and focus on that.\" \nSpoken like a captain. A captain, remember, elected by his teammates. So Meyer being afraid of losing the locker room is clearly not the problem. What really's baffling is that in resisting a switch he's also not fully committed to running a read-option offense anymore.. For so long it was his bread-and-butter, an attack that Barrett executes as well as any quarterback in the country, as he's shown the last two games. \nIt's not one of Jones' strengths, to put it kindly. \nWhile we try to wrap our heads around Meyer's thought process, maybe Saturday's road game at Rutgers will make his decision for him. Thought to be a patsy when the season began, the Scarlet Knights took Michigan State to the wire two weeks ago and rode a huge wave of momentum home after rallying from 25 points down in the last 20 minutes for a 55-52 win at Indiana. They've scored an average of 37 points in four home games, three against power conference schools. \nAnd OSU's defense has looked less than invincible lately. \nThe Buckeyes need to start the quarterback with the hot hand, the only one they can trust, right? \nRight, Urban?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:56:00.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
