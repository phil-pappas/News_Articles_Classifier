With an ongoing commitment to nurture deeper community relations in the northwest suburbs, they frequently sponsor initiatives like Project Linus and the Youth Leadership Shoe Drive.\nThat same vision of community focus is what initially led Luxem, and her two young boys, to the sports club. \"I've always placed tremendous value on developing strong ties to one's community. Those same values have been instrumental in my success as a local business owner,\" says Luxem. \"Elite has fostered a similar sense of community here in the northwest suburbs, so when my sons expressed an interest in soccer two years ago, I knew Elite was the place for us.\"\nNow, as Luxem transitions to a position on the board, her professional background will serve the organization well. ESCO's founder and president, Mike Steele , believes the mutual commitment to community development makes Luxem a great fit for the role.\n\"It is exciting to have Carrie Luxem join the ESCO board. Because she is an area resident and business owner, I feel that she has a deep connection to the northwest suburbs and will help further ESCO's mission of building community by developing the area's youth through soccer. She takes pride in giving back and I feel ESCO will benefit greatly from her involvement,\" says Steele.\nLuxem agrees. \"Mike and I both share the same passion, which is to help today's youth develop the skills and mindset to grow into innovative, compassionate leaders,\" she says. \"I believe, together, we have the capacity to make great strides for the future of our children.\"\nABOUT ESCO\nMISSION: To build community by developing youth through soccer in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago .\nVISION: To become a national non-profit model for building strong communities by empowering and developing tomorrow's leaders through soccer.\nVALUES: Social responsibility, character, leadership and education.\nVisit www.elitesoccercommunity.org to learn more about ESCO.\nABOUT RESTAURANT HR GROUP\nRestaurant HR Group is a fast-growing, Chicago -based human resources support firm, specializing in the restaurant industry.
