But at the end of the day, it was still his fault. He (or his caddy, who are one and the same) had different golf balls in Mickelson’s golf bag, a violation which, at the very least, would have cost his team one hole and ended up costing it two holes, in a match split with Jason Day and Adam Scott. So, obviously, Mickelson was contrite about the whole thing in his post-round press conference. Either that, or he just threw down the gauntlet and basically invited the International team to a steel-cage match, golf-style.\nAdChoices\n#FIGJAM pic.twitter.com/pLy5UTrN8w\n— Brendan Porath (@BrendanPorath) October 9, 2015\nJust a huge, huge bravo to Phil. The half-grin, right as he realizes what he’s about to say, is classic. I love it. You messed up. You’re the reason why your entire team leads by one point instead of two points, yet you’re still talking trash. Who says golf is too dull?\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BrendanPorath/status/652398503382024192", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://t.co/pLy5UTrN8w", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIGJAM?src=hash", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/phil-mickelsons-controversial-gaffe-ball-presidents-cup-golf-ball"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:26:56.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
