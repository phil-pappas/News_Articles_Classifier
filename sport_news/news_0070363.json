(AP) - The Chicago Bears have signed defensive lineman Ziggy Hood and cut defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff. \nHood signed a four-year deal with Jacksonville in March 2014, but he missed the first part of the season after he hurt his foot in the exhibition finale. Hood was released from the injured list on Tuesday after he passed a physical. \nThe 6-foot-3 Hood was a first-round pick by Pittsburgh in the 2009 draft out of Missouri. He has 12 1/2 sacks and 164 tackles in six seasons with the Steelers and Jaguars. \nRatliff was suspended for the first three games of this season for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. He started at nose tackle in each of Chicago’s last two games and had seven tackles. \nRatliff, a four-time Pro Bowl selection in Dallas, had 6 1/2 sacks last season for the Bears. \nThe team announced the moves Thursday. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:39:59.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
