Kennell, 62, is alleged to have tried to steal a booklet of bus transfer slips before spraying the driver with cayenne pepper bear repellant.\nKennell boarded the downtown-bound bus at 8:30 a.m., when it stopped at Queen Anne Avenue and Crockett Street. Writing the court, a King County Sheriff’s Office detective said the driver stopped Kennel as he reached for the paper booklet.\nAccording to charging papers, Kennell then pulled a can of bear spray and discharged it into the driver’s face. Bear spray’s pepper content is about twice that of the strongest personal defense sprays.\nKennell ran from the bus as the driver called for help, the detective said in charging papers. Seattle Fire Department medics helped the driver clean his face, but he still had to be relieved from duty for the day.\nKennell remained unidentified until Oct. 8, when the driver spotted him getting on the bus. The driver stealthily called for help, and deputies arrested Kennel later that day. According to charging papers, Kennell was carrying a can of bear spray in a hip holster.\nNow charged with third-degree assault, Kennell remains jailed on $30,000 bail.\nSeattlepi.com reporter Levi Pulkkinen can be reached at 206-448-8348 or levipulkkinen@seattlepi.com .
