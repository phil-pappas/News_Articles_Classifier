The 28-year-old midfielder for FC Kansas City is retiring from soccer following the title game Thursday night against the Seattle Reign in Portland ( 6:30 p.m., Fox Sports 1 ). Holiday announced plans to step away from the game in July, shortly after winning the FIFA Women’s World Cup with the U.S. national team. But she vowed to first finish out the season with her NWSL club.
