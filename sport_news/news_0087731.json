But an Indiana penalty for illegal hands to the face negated the fumble and gave Penn State a first down at the 49-yard line. \nTwo plays later, Hackenberg hit freshman Brandon Polk on a beautifully conceived jet-screen release for a touchdown, giving the Lions a 7-0 lead. The sequence enraged Indiana coach Kevin Wilson, whose team also entered the game 4-1. \n\"I thought we were ready to go, but at the same time there was just a little bit more selfishness with our actions today, just playing and functioning as a football team,\" Wilson said. \"Today, Penn State was a much better football team across the board.\" \nIn the second quarter, Hackenberg connected on a squarely thrown touchdown pass to DaeSean Hamilton, who knew his post route would be open as soon as he beat the cornerback off the line. That 39-yard touchdown pass began a run of 22 unanswered points for Penn State to take over the game. \nPerhaps an even bigger revelation, however, was Hackenberg's running, particularly in the second half. The 6-4, 230-pound quarterback flustered Indiana by ditching the pocket to scramble on several occasions. \nAmong his run were a 22-yarder (a career-long) and two for scores, one of which he capped with a McGloinesque dive. On the other, Hackenberg eschewed throwing to a wide-open Carter in favor of the safe rushing touchdown. \nFittingly, the last time a Penn State quarterback had two rushing touchdowns in a game was McGloin against Illinois in 2012. Last week, quarterbacks coach Ricky Rahne hinted that Hackenberg might run more Saturday —\"When it's there, I would love to see him take off,\" Rahne said — and the quarterback saw the lanes. \nInterestingly, that also hinted to how successful Penn State's offense could be with a quarterback who can turn broken plays into first downs. \n\"W talked to a lot of people in the off-season, and everybody talks about two first downs,\" Franklin said. \"If a quarterback can get two first downs a game for you with his legs, you're going to be in a really good position. Christian was able to do that.\" \nAfter the game, Franklin was feeling good, too. The Lions swept their stretch of five home games and will take a 5-1 record to Ohio State next week. \nAs a result, he joked that Penn State played \"ugly football\" the past four weeks simply to bloom on Saturday against Indiana. Further, he suggested (sarcastically) that Penn State would reshape Hackenberg into a new role. \n\"I think now,\" Franklin said, \"we will have conversations about him being a dual-threat quarterback and installing the option.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:30:53.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
