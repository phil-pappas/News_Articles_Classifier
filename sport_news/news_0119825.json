With a farewell to three seniors and multiple transfers, eight freshmen along with three other newcomers will look to fill the void comprising one of the nation's youngest teams. The biggest holes to fill stand out at the 1 and 5 positions... Four-year starter Linda Stepney was the go-to distributor at the point. Her absence nearly assures a multitude of freshmen taking over. Kayla Montgomery's injury leaves only Lanay Montgomery at center. A similar situation to when Crystal Leary had to back up Ayana Dunning when Asya Bussie was lost for the the 2013 season. An assurance hailing the youthful group is All-Big 12 guard Bria Holmes. Her 716 points last year rank 2nd all-time in the programs single-season history books. Scoring over 1,400 points in her first three years, only a return to the Big Dance will rectify the missed opportunity that concluded last March.
