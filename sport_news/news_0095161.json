But there have been too many changes for bold predictions about this year’s team. There is a certain wait-and-see element to things.\nThe biggest question mark is on defense. Gone is Dougie Hamilton, and Dennis Seidenberg will start the first couple of months on the shelf due to back surgery. It is not yet known when Zdeno Chara will return. Players with little to no NHL experience, like Zach Trotman, Joe Morrow, Colin Miller and free agent signee Matt Irwin, could play prominent roles on this team.\nAnd while coach Claude Julien’s defensive system will not be overhauled, tweaks are being implemented to push the pace.\nThat sounds like a recipe for a slow start, if not worse. But Neely doesn’t believe it.\n“It’s a little bit of a transition where we’ve got some younger players that I think will develop over the course of the year and get better over the course of the year,” said Neely. “I think the coaching staff’s going to do a really good job in helping these players develop. And I think we’re going to see the team improve over the course of the season.\n“But having said that, we still have enough players who have been around the game long enough and are good NHL players who can help bring those guys along at a quicker pace. And I feel like we can have a strong start because of that.”\nWhile Neely, who took exception to the notion that Julien is already on the hot seat, conceded the defense is a work in progress. He believes improvements have been made elsewhere. While they traded a sometimes impact player in Milan Lucic up front, Neely feels the moves that brought in forwards Jimmy Hayes, Matt Beleskey and Joonas Kemppainen represent improvement.\n“I don’t have a crystal ball, but I feel our forward group is pretty deep. I think we’re going to get some more offense from our four lines. We’re going to be more consistent in that regard,” said Neely.\n“I think our goaltending situation is going to be better than last year. I think we can reduce the amount of games that Tuukka (Rask) had to play last year. From the back end, I’m excited to see some of these guys develop, I really am. You know what they can do offensively. Not all of them are the same, but the kids we brought in, they skate extremely well and with Claude and the staff, they can work with them on tightening things up a little bit on the defensive side.\n“I see us improving throughout the course of the year, I really do, with the group that we have that’s new and the group we have that’s returning. I’m excited to see us get going in the regular season, but I really believe that we’re going to improve as the season goes along.”\nAnd if a fix needs to be made, Neely believes the Bruins are in good position to do that. According to generalfanager.com, the B’s are $4,764,333 under the salary cap.\n“I don’t want to put any expectations on it. Our goal is to compete for Stanley Cups. We’ll see how the season plays out,” said Neely. “We have some cap space which we haven’t had in a while, so we have some opportunities down the road if there’s a situation that arises where Don feels he can do something that’s going to help us improve.\n“I really do feel that we’ve got guys who want to compete for Stanley Cups on our roster. We’ve brought in guys that do want to compete. They want to win. We’ll see where things go throughout the season.\n“But I like the fact that we have opportunities to improve if need be. It’s a lot easier to do that when you can add without having to subtract.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:37:08.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
