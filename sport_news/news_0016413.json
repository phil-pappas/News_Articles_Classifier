Beisner of KSTV shared the video of the moment when Muschamp told the sophomore wideout, “I screwed up. I’m a dumb[butt]. You’re a [heckuva] player.”\nWill Muschamp to Garrett Johnson, who never received a scholarship offer from the coach at Florida: pic.twitter.com/zncIWMxVKG\n— T.J. Beisner (@Beisner_cn2) October 16, 2015 Johnson attended high school at West Orange, which is near Orlando and less than 100 miles from Gainesville. Chris Hays of the Orlando Sentinel notes Johnson was a life-long Florida fan , but when Muschamp and the coaching staff didn’t offer a scholarship, Johnson “was miffed” and committed to Kentucky instead.\n© Mark Zerof/USA TODAY Sports Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp told former recruit, wide receiver Garrett Johnson, that he screwed up by night offering him a scholarship at Florida while coach. Listed at 5’9″ and 160 pounds as a recruit, he certainly wasn’t the prototypical size for a receiver at a big-time program. Nevertheless, Johnson has already proved Muschamp wrong in person—twice.\nOn Thursday, Johnson set career-high marks with nine receptions and 160 yards, eclipsing previous bests of six catches and 154 yards. Yes, he torched Muschamp and Florida for those numbers last season, during a game Johnson also caught two touchdowns.\nCredit Muschamp for the gesture, because Johnson must’ve felt a strong sense of satisfaction after the encounter.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://t.co/zncIWMxVKG", "https://twitter.com/Beisner_cn2/status/655013659941433344", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/florida-recruiting/blog/os-kentucky-garrett-johnson-florida-gators-20140914-post.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:48:19.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
