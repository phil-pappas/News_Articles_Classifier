Citing commissioner Steve Hinds of New Zealand reviewed video of the match and charged the Wallabies vice-captain. Hooper, who has 48 test caps, is set to face a hearing today in London, and should know the findings within 24 hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:20:00.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
