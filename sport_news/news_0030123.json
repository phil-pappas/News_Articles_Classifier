We expect that actual amount will be much less than Rs 6,100 crore being reported,” BoB Executive Director B.B. Joshi told PTI.\nIt would be difficult to say anything definitive about the amount involved at this stage, he added.\nJoshi further said that bulk of the fund came from over 30 banks either by RTGS or NEFT. “90 per cent of amount has come from various banks. Only 10 per cent cash transaction has taken place at our branch.”\nThe investigation will lead to money trail and clear the air as whether it was black money or not, he said.\nLast week, the CBI and Enforcement Directorate started investigation into the matter. It is alleged that Rs 6,172 crore black money was remitted from the Bank of Baroda to Hong Kong camouflaged as payments for non-existent imports like cashew, pulses and rice.\nIt is also alleged that amount was deposited in 59 accounts of the bank’s Ashok Vihar branch in cash as advance for import and the money was sent to some select companies in Hong Kong.\nEmphasising that it is the bank which detected these irregular transaction and reported it to the CBI and ED, Joshi said the bank has terminated the services of the concurrent auditor.\n“We have taken action against our own employees. Two employees have been suspended—one branch head and an officer dealing in the forex,” he said.\nThese people have done it in very thoughtful manner and guilty won’t be spared, he said.\nAsserting that there is no financial loss to the bank in this case, he said there is, however, damage to the reputation. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:03:51.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
