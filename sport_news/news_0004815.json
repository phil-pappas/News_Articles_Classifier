We weren’t anywhere near as fast as we wanted to be at Charlotte (last Sunday), which was frustrating. \n“And I’m not sure I could answer why we’re faster this week, but sometimes that stuff just comes and goes, and you don’t really understand why. But when you have speed, you’ve got to make the most of it.” \nGetting the last pick of pit stalls won’t help Keselowski’s cause, but Edwards didn’t seem to mind the unexpected bonus. \n“So we’ll get that first pit stall (closest to the exit from pit road),” a delighted Edwards said after time trials. “That’ll be huge. That’s a gift — and we’ll take it.” \nBoth Keselowski and Edwards are among 12 Chase drivers vying for eight spots in the Eliminator 8 Round of NASCAR’s 10-race playoff, with the cutoff looming Oct. 25 at Talladega Superspeedway. \nOnly 14th-place qualifier Joey Logano, who with Dale Earnhardt, Jr. (15th) was one of two Chase drivers who didn’t make the top 12 on Friday, has already advanced to the Eliminator 8 Round, by virtue of last Sunday’s victory at Charlotte. \nIn addition to Keselowski, Edwards, Logano and Earnhardt, other Chase drivers will line up as follows: Kyle Busch, third; Kevin Harvick, fourth; Denny Hamlin, fifth; Jeff Gordon, sixth; Martin Truex Jr., seventh; Kurt Busch, ninth; and Matt Kenseth, 10th. \nRyan Blaney (eighth), running a limited schedule for Wood Brothers Racing, was the only non-Chase driver to crack the top 10. Blaney posted the fastest lap in the second round of qualifying at 195.164 mph. \nHarvick had difficulty getting up to speed during Friday’s opening practice session, but the reigning series champion was relieved by his fourth-place qualifying effort. \n“That’s a win for us,” Harvick said. “We thought we were going to have to race our way from 25th, so to be fourth is a big improvement.” \nNotes: Timmy Hill failed to make the 43-car field… Casey Mears’ No. 13 Chevrolet broke loose and slammed into the turn 4 wall seven minutes into the first round of qualifying, forcing him to a backup car for Sunday’s race. \nWDUN will have live MRN Radio coverage of Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Hollywood Casino 400 from Kansas Speedway beginning at 1 pm on 102.9 FM and 550 AM. \nNASCAR Sprint Cup Series Kansas Speedway – Kansas City, KS Hollywood Casino 400 – Oct. 16, 2015 \nFriday’s Qualifying Results \n1.
