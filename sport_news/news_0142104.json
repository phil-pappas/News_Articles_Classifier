Adam Cuthbertson wins major gong \nFormer NRL lock Adam Cuthbertson has been named the Rugby League Writers and Broadcasters Association’s 2015 player of the year. \nThe 30-year-old Australian, who spent time at Manly, Cronulla, St George Illawarra and Newcastle, had a breakthrough year for Leeds in his first season in the English Super League. \nThe barnstorming back-rower , who will be presented with the Raymond Fletcher Trophy at the association’s annual dinner at Headingley on November 11, threw a record 125 offloads in 29 matches this year – almost double his nearest rival. \nAssociation chairman Trevor Hunt said: “When much of the focus at Leeds was on the retiring Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock, it is testimony to the impact that Adam has made this year that he won the vote in such esteemed company. \n“The fantastic ball-handling play that he has brought to Super League shows there is still a place in the modern game for such old-fashioned skills.” \nCuthbertson, who is on a three-man shortlist for the Man of Steel award which will be announced on Monday, topped the writers’ poll ahead of his Leeds team-mate Zak Hardaker and Castleford scrum-half Luke Gale.
