In a ceremony held in a hotel in the center of the Spanish capital—and also attended by his coach, Rafael Benitez, and club president Florentino Perez—Ronaldo said it was an honor and a privilege to receive his fourth Golden Boot. Ronaldo has got off to a relatively sluggish start to this campaign. A striking stat shows that although he has scored five goals in seven league appearances to date, they all came in that same 6-0 win at Espanyol in September.But two Champions League goals in a recent game in Malmo saw him overtake Raul Gonzalez as the club's all-time top goal-scorer, and he now has scored 324 times for the club. Ronaldo says that winning trophies is key to collecting these individual awards.\"I'm the only one who has four Golden Boots, but I want more, the fifth, the sixth, if I can. Obviously, that means winning things as a group, as a team, trophies,\" Ronaldo said.\"For me, Real Madrid is the biggest club in the world and it has to win titles every year. Obviously, this year won't be any different. We have the opportunity and we want to win the league, the Champions League if possible, the cup, obviously, because without those trophies these individual trophies aren't possible.\" Related Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:39:04.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
