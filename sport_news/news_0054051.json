When he sacked Colin Kaepernick in the third quarter, he kissed his right biceps Kaepernick-style to punctuate the play - one of Green Bay's six sacks.\nWhile methodical with nothing fancy, Green Bay (4-0) seemed unfazed with a short week and long trip West after beating Kansas City last Monday night.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n NFL Football Pro Men Associated Press", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:45:27.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
