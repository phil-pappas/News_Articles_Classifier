Given his \"high pain tolerance,\" there's a chance he'd attempt to play through the ailment, Aaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle reports.\nSmith suffered the injury after taking a helmet to the lower back in the third quarter and was unable to return despite apparent efforts to do so. He took aim at Steelers safety Mike Mitchell following the game, telling reporters the defensive back would be on his \"lifetime hit list\" as a result of the play.\nThe 36-year-old has produced as the Ravens' top playmaker after announcing this would be his final season, carrying an otherwise thin receiving corps with 29 receptions for 373 yards and two touchdowns.\nWith first-round rookie Breshad Perriman out indefinitely after a setback in his recovery from a knee injury, and Michael Campanaro heading for injured reserve due to a back injury of his own, the Ravens added depth at the position by acquiring veteran wideout Chris Givens in a trade with the St. Louis Rams on Saturday.\nCopyright © 2015 Score Media Ventures Inc.
