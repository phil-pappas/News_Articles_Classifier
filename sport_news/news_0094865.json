The decision came after an update from election monitor Domenico Scala, whose committee rules on the candidates' eligibility.\nPlatini submitted his candidacy ahead of the Oct. 26 deadline but faces being kept out over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) from FIFA for work he says was carried out at least nine years earlier.\nPlatini has challenged his suspension and is awaiting the verdict of the FIFA appeals committee. UEFA is pushing for a swift decision in appeals at FIFA and possibly the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nAdvertisement Sheikh Salman, the Asian Football Confederation president from Bahrain, should now enter the race as part of an agreement with UEFA, his key backer told The Associated Press.\n\"It is a big possibility,\" Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, a FIFA executive committee member from Kuwait and longtime Olympic powerbroker, said after a meeting of the ruling panel.\nSheikh Salman has also written to his AFC executive committee members saying he has \"recently been urged by a growing number of senior\" people within the game to run for the FIFA presidency. The Bahraini royal was seeking advice from colleagues before making a decision.\nUEFA officials held regular strategy talks with Sheikh Ahmad ahead of Tuesday's emergency FIFA session, which was briefed on Platini's status as a potential candidate.\nFIFA said its election oversight committee will not rule on Platini's eligibility as a candidate — including a mandatory integrity check — until \"such a ban be lifted or expire before the FIFA presidential election.\"\nSheikh Ahmad said confidential talks had taken place about what to do if Platini clears his name.\n\"From our side I think we are in a fair procedure,\" the sheikh said. \"At least there (are) some names and there is understanding between the continents. Myself, I trust Platini.\"\nPlatini was the election front-runner until Sept. 25, when he was questioned by Swiss federal police about the suspected \"disloyal payment\" approved by Blatter from FIFA funds.\nSwitzerland's attorney general, Michael Lauber, opened criminal proceedings against Blatter and put Platini under suspicion. Both deny wrongdoing.\nUntil then, Platini's camp believed it could count on votes from more than 110 of the 209 FIFA federations, mostly from Europe, Asia and South America.\nShould Sheikh Salman enter the race, \"he will start with the same big number of potential support,\" Sheikh Ahmad said. \"I think there will be more than three continents.\"\nAside from Platini, former FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan and former Trinidad and Tobago player David Nakhid have said they submitted their five required federation nominations.\nThe FIFA crisis, which was sparked by the arrest of soccer officials in Zurich ahead of Blatter's re-election in May, led to a reform process being instigated to overhaul how the organization is run.\nThe reform commission, chaired by former IOC secretary general Francois Carrard, said Tuesday it was proposing a 12-year term limit for FIFA presidents and an age limit of 74 for the president and executives.\n The committee also recommended that the annual pay of the president and executives be made public. The tainted executive committee could be renamed as the \"FIFA Council.\"\nAny changes have to be approved by all 209 FIFA members at the Feb. 26 congress in Zurich.\nThe executive committee was chaired in Blatter's absence by FIFA's senior vice president Issa Hayatou, the longtime African soccer leader who is now interim president.\nBlatter is also challenging his provisional ban pending a full investigation by the FIFA ethics committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:40:19.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
