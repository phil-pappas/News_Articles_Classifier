He met with eventual starting quarterback Talmage Gunther almost every day in the offseason, and the duo would regularly shovel snow to clear a field to throw to each other. \nThe long offseason paid off Thursday night when the Knights won the Region 4 championship. \nGunther threw three touchdown passes — two of them to Christensen — and ran for another score to lift Lone Peak to a 30-0 shutout win at Herriman, clinching the Region 4 title, an undefeated regular season and a top seed in next week's Class 5A playoffs. \nHerriman, which entered the matchup previously unbeaten in region play, claimed the No. 2 seed from Region 4. \n\"It was good to see the hard work pay off tonight,\" Christensen said after going off for 182 yards and two scores on nine catches. \"This was probably the biggest game in my life. We really turned it around from last year; we had five wins last year, and we just doubled our win total. It was an awesome game.\" \nGunther finished with 305 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions on 22-of-34 passing, with two touchdown passes to receiver and longtime workout partner Christensen. The 6-foot-1 senior had a game-high 182 yards receiving, and Tyler MacPherson added a 35-yard touchdown grab to cap the Knights' opening drive. \n\"We've been watching film all week, and we saw some things that I thought we could take advantage of in the passing game,\" said Gunther, who said his army of receivers \"made me look better than I am. We did that. But hats off to (Herriman); they did a really good job adjusting and slowing us up toward the end of the half. But I think we made adjustments and came out and finished the game.\" There are things that Talmage does that you just don't coach. He's got the savvy that you want to have in a quarterback, and he knows what he is doing out there. He executed very well. –Lone Peak coach Mike Mower \nThe defense also came to play, holding a highly touted Herriman rush offense to 50 yards in the first half, forcing eight tackles for loss on the evening. \nLone Peak coach Mike Mower credited that to the game plan of his assistant coaches and defensive staff. \n\"We knew it was going to be a physical ballgame, and we knew Herriman would come out and try to smack us,\" Mower said. \"I was proud of how kids came out defensively and really got after it. \n\"I can't say enough about my assistants, both offensively and defensively. They did a great job, and it showed tonight.\" \nMacPherson opened the scoring on a 35-yard touchdown grab from Gunther on third down with 8:55 left in the first quarter, and Thomas Rossi made it 10-0 with a 33-yard field goal with 3:05 left in the opening period. \nHerriman blocked a field-goal attempt with 8:55 left in the second quarter, and appeared to take momentum from it. But the Knights (10-0, 6-0 Region 4) ended the next Mustang drive with an interception with 5:13 left to go before halftime. \nThat was plenty of time for Christensen to go to work, and the senior veteran pulled down Gunther's 8-yard TD toss with 19.3 seconds on the clock to go up 17-0 at the break. \nGunther finished with 201 yards on 14-of-21 passing with two touchdowns in the first half. \n\"There are things that Talmage does that you just don't coach,\" Mower said. \"He's got the savvy that you want to have in a quarterback, and he knows what he is doing out there. He executed very well.\" \nHerriman (7-3, 5-1) struggled with penalties most of the night, and had three in inopportune moments as the Mustangs fell farther back in the third quarter. A Mustang penalty on third-and-long with 3:33 to go gave Lone Peak the ball at its own 34-yard line, and Gunther hit Christensen over the middle for a 66-yard completion and their second scoring hookup of the night to go up 24-0 on a blocked PAT heading into the final period. \n\"Oh my gosh; that's the best defense in the state,\" Christensen said of the Knights' defense. \"They motivate us to be better, and we feed off their momentum. They put us in good positions on the field. I love them so much.\" \nGunther got it done with his legs in the fourth quarter, finishing the Knights' penultimate drive with a 10-yard touchdown scamper to go up 30-0 with 6:08 remaining on the clock. The 6-foot senior who entered the season without the starting job ran the ball six times for 32 yards in addition to his score. \nTyler Kap added 29 yards on nine carries on the ground. \n\"This means a lot,\" Gunther said. \"When we talked about things before the season, we put region champs as one of our goals. But that's not the ultimate goal. We still want one more championship.\" \nContributing: Matt Glade", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:14:46.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
