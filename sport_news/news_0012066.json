Dillon Adams threw for 147 yards and three touchdowns while Kolbi Wright rushed 25 times for 134 yards as Cape henlopen upset visiting Dover at Legends Stadium Friday night October 16 35 to 14. The win propels Cape to a record of 4 & 2 .The Vikings will host Caesar Rodney on Friday, October 23. We played so badly against Sussex Central and I looked at the film and it was even worse,”Coach Bill Collick said after the Dover game . “I ask some of our key players if it was possibly we had fallen so far so fast. I knew we had to play better and I knew Dover was a team that can jump out quickly. “ But it was Cape doing the jumping racing to a 28 -0 first half lead on an Adam to Jeremiah Smack 39 yard pass,a touchdown pass of 10 yards to Rasheed Woods a 15 yard return of an interception for a touchdown by Erik Stancofski and a 31 yd Adams to Woods touchdown toss. “This is as big a win for this program since we got here, ”said Defensive Coordinator John Parker. Both Jaco Lopez and Aarin Burton were first time starters at offensive tackle and they did a heck of a job.” Look for future game story detail in the Tuesday edition of the Cape Gazette.
