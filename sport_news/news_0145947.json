At least 107 pilgrims died in a cane crash in Mecca, while at least 1,090 pilgrims died at Mina on the last leg of the pilgrimage this year. At least 636 others were reported missing in these incidents, the Chief Minister said.\nEarlier, Speaker Kavinder Gupta made obituary references on the demise of the former President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam and nine other former ministers and members of the Legislative Assembly and Council on the first day of the autumn session.\nAfter the Speaker made references on the life and achievements of the members who passed away since the last session, the Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Basharat Ahmad Bukhari, sought to include obituary on the death of the Haj pilgrims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:40:00.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
