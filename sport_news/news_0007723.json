Parrish \nDemocrat Editor \nLast week in this space it was suggested we embrace the parallels with 1980 when a 1-6 team went 2-1 over the last three weeks to finish 3-7. So far, so good, after a 21-14 win in Mansfield last week. And, make no mistake, this was a big win. \nThe win, which snapped a four game losing streak, runs to 20 the number of consecutive wins over Mansfield since a loss in that 1980 season. \nIt did something else. It made sure that the 2015 team is not mentioned in the same sentences with the 1940s, or earlier. \nOnly five times in the now 96 seasons of Bearcat football has the win count been 1 or fewer and all were at least 66 years ago. The 1949 team went 1-9, the 1940 team was 1-4-3, in 1934 the record was 1-7, the program starting 1920 team went 1-5 and the 1942 team finished 0-4 as the only winless team in school history. \nOf note on the last entry was that Rev. W.W. Grafton served as the coach of that team during the World War II era just so that the school would not have to fold the program. \nThe win also kept the possibilities of a week 11 game alive. Players of the sideline were keenly aware of the fact during Mansfield’s last drive Friday night trying to encourage the players on the field by reminding them they were playing for the playoffs. \nRegardless of what happens on Friday against Charleston, the Bearcats are in the playoffs if they beat Lavaca in week 10 and Two Rivers doesn’t beat either Lamar or Danville in the final two weeks and Mansfield doesn’t beat Charleston. \nRight now Booneville, Two Rivers, Mansfield and Lavaca all have one Conference 3A-4 win. Mansfield and Lavaca play each other this week so the winner will have two. If Mansfield wins and the Bearcats beat Lavaca, they both have two and the Bearcats have head-to-head tiebreaker. If Lavaca wins and the Bearcats then beat Lavaca, both will have two wins and, again, the Bearcats will have the head-to-head tiebreaker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:23:01.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
