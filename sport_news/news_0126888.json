(WKYT) - Kentucky coach John Calipari gave The Greater Louisville UK Alumni Club a preview of the season ahead. The Alumni Club hosted its annual UK Basketball Tipoff Luncheon at the Galt House. \n“This year’s team, as we speak, we stink,” Calipari said. “I said to them two days ago; I said, ‘There’s one really good thing that is happening.’ And they said ‘What’s that, Coach?’ I said, ‘We’re not playing tomorrow, so we’re okay. I’m not going to panic yet.'” \nCalipari believes his backcourt will be a real strength in the coming season and one of the biggest reasons is the return of Tyler Ulis. Cal praised the way Ulis has performed in practice. \n“Tyler Ulis, in three days of practice had 25 assists and three turnovers. He’s really good. My other guards are underwater with that, they have more turnovers than assists. But that’s okay, they are learning.” \nCalipari said he had no idea of how his team will play offensively and everything right now is an experiment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:47:11.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
