He's the Giants' starting fullback, he's a valuable special teams player and he's now the team's late-game defensive weapon.\nWhat does that mean?\nThe Giants are using Whitlock as a pass-rushing defensive tackle. He's small for a defensive tackle, at only 5-10 and 245 pounds, but he can use his quickness and incredible strength to get to the quarterback. Entering Monday night's game against the 49ers, Whitlock had a sack, a quarterback hit and a hurry in 18 snaps as a defensive tackle.\nThese details come from this story in NJ.com, which includes this Quote: from Giants center Weston Richburg:\n\"I've never [blocked him] and I hope I never have to do it. I feel so bad for those guys who have to block that guy. He's a mismatch when he gets in there, especially at the end of games when guys are tired.\"\nAnyone who watched Wylie play back in 2007 and 2008 -- Whitlock helped the Pirates get to the 5A Division II title game in 2008 -- remembers how Whitlock was a mismatch.\nTwitter: @mattwixon\nOn Twitter:\n @mattwixon", "external_links": ["http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/10/why_nikita_whitlock_is_so_hard_to_block_and_the_49.html", "https://twitter.com/mattwixon", "http://www.twitter.com/mattwixon"], "published": "2015-10-12T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:30:12.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
