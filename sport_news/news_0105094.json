Pop is pounding on that, giving a lot of importance to that.”\nVideo: Spurs-Suns postgame wrap The Suns scored 19 fast break points on Tuesday, and though nine of those came off turnovers Popovich could not have been content.\n\"Hopefully, we improve soon,” Ginobili said. “It has definitely not been good, sometimes on the excuse that we are still getting there. But that's the easiest thing to do and we've always been pretty good in that.\nBut the Spurs had not been good in transition through the first four preseason games. Popovich labeled it as bad as the porous transition defense last season's Spurs played in losses in Games 6 and 7 of the team's first-round playoff loss to the Clippers in May.\nHow bad was that?\n\"Worst transition defense in the history of basketball,\" Popovich said.\nGo to Express-News.com to read more about this game and to find more Spurs coverage.\nmikemonroe@express-news.net\nTwitter: @Monroe_SA", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823988/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823987/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824135/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824134/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824132/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823987/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/24/8824127/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824129/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824131/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823982/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824133/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823988/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823983/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824131/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823984/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824130/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823983/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823984/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824133/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824135/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824130/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824134/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824132/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824129/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/24/8824127/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/22/8823982/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:58:26.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
