This Friday night, they take on Indian River (2-3) in the first of five-straight divisional matchups to end the regular season. Having faced off against just one divisional opponent, a 48-0 win over Seaford last week, puts the Bucs in the driver seat to control their own destiny over the final five weeks of the season. Through five games, it’s hard to say that Milford has not surpassed any and all expectations many had for them this season. After struggling mightily the past few seasons, the Bucs look like a new team this year, one that is now poised to make a run at a division title. “I knew coming into the season that Milford had a great number of athletes and they would be ready to get to work as they were hungry for wins,” said first-year Head Coach Shaun Strickland. “In terms of success, I was not looking to measure that by our record but by our growth as a team and as leaders, and as the year progresses we are still learning and still growing but our staff sees that progress week in and week out and we could not be more pleased.” Strickland and his staff have put their players in positions to succeed all year long, and behind the team’s effort as a whole, they’ve been impressive on both sides of the ball this year. The Bucs offense has been electric, scoring 36 or more points in four of their five games, averaging just over 41 points per game on the season. Meanwhile, on defense the Bucs have posted three shutouts, including holding opponents Seaford and Conrad to zeros in back-to-back weeks. Overall, the Milford defense is allowing just eight points per game to their opponents this season. The Bucs have already spoiled one homecoming game, downing Conrad two weeks ago 36-0, and Friday night they look to do it again when they travel to Indian River. The Indians got off to a rough start, losing their first three games by a combined score of 89-12 in losses to Maryland’s Linganore High School, along with Division I team’s Sussex Tech and Cape Henlopen. Lately, however, Indian River has played some solid football and enter Friday night’s contest on a two-game winning streak. Two weeks ago, the Indians downed Seaford 48-0, before getting past Laurel last week 28-18. “I know IR is consistently in conversations when you discuss teams that have been a top team in the Henlopen South over the past decade,” said Strickland. “I know that they just beat a very good and tough Laurel team at home. We know that we have to be focused all week at practice because they are a very good football team with physical players and they have found success and are going after the same thing we are, the Henlopen South.” Strickland and his team, fresh off their own homecoming victory last week, know that Indian River will come out ready to play hard in front of their home fans. “There is added motivation for them because its homecoming and no one likes to lose on their homecoming,” Strickland said. “Which means we have to focus that much more and be that much more disciplined going into kickoff on Friday night.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:47:44.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
