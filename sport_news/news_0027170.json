Hayne made a couple of returns for six yards apiece, was bumped off a punt catch by his own teammates and otherwise avoided by Packers’ punter Tim Masthay. \nWriting for the 49ers’ official website, Taylor Price said Hayne - coming off a terrific 37-yard return that led to a touchdown the previous game - was treated like an NFL veteran by the Packers. \n“Jarryd Hayne appears to have settled into his role as the starting punt returner for the San Francisco 49ers,” Price wrote. \n“In Sunday’s 17-3 loss to the Green Bay Packers, the 27-year-old rookie was treated like a veteran returner, too. Packers punter Tim Masthay attempted six punts on the day. Three of those balls were placed out of bounds away from Hayne.” \nPrice continued: “Hayne, however, did not get much of an opportunity to spark San Francisco’s offense like he did a week before with a 37-yard return against the Arizona Cardinals.
