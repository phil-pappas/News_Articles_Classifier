Coach: Danny Manning. \nConference: Atlantic Coast. \nKey returners: G Codi Miller-McIntyre, led team in scoring (14.7 ppg) and assists (137) but is out another 3-5 weeks with a broken foot. F Devin Thomas, had five 20-point games and ranked second in ACC with 12 double-doubles. \nWho left: High-energy forward Aaron Rountree graduated and transferred to Iona. Part-time starting guard Madison Jones was dismissed in August for violating athletic department policy. \nThe Skinny: The Demon Deacons expect to show they’re making progress in Year 2 under Manning, but will that improvement translate into wins? It won’t be an easy task in an always-tough ACC. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:52:04.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
