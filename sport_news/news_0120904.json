Martin, who advanced to third on the errant throw to the plate, came home on a single to centre by Ryan Goins, who rapped out a career-high five hits. \nThe Jays never looked back in a rout where Jose Bautista clubbed his 40th bomb of the season. \nThey upped the lead to 4-0 in the fourth on an RBI single by Ben Revere which scored Goins who reached on a bunt single employed against the shift. Bautista also brought in a run with a bases-loaded walk. \nThe Jays put it away in the fifth when two brutal Baltimore throwing errors led to three unearned runs in a four-run inning that pushed the lead to 8-0. \nMarcus Stroman went eight strong innings for the win to up his record to an unblemished 4-0. \nManager John Gibbons has been proud of the way his boys have played all season, from the first game to No. 157 Wednesday afternoon. What’s he been most proud of? \n“Just the way they approach it every day,” said Gibbons, now in his seventh season overall as the Jays manager and third in his second term. “They just keep coming at you. Things don’t get them down. There’s no question it’s a very talented group but they have that winning mentality too. Really, they don’t let up, they didn’t let up all year good or bad. But, there’s no substitute for talent either.” \nLooking back from when he was here the first time to now, Gibbons was asked in what areas does he believe the organization has progressed the most? \n“Better players and more of them,” Gibbons replied. “For a lot of that stretch when I’ve been here anyway it’s always the Yankees-Red Sox heads above everybody else. Those were the two teams that were battling it out there at the end. This year the difference is amazing, we added some top-notch players that put us in this spot.” \nAnd what of adding so-called character players such as Josh Donaldson and Russell Martin, what’s that impact? \n“The character end of it for me is you’ve got guys that just keep pushing, keep pushing. It’s not necessarily that they’re better guys, they just have a different mentality. I think it’s (character) definitely a factor but there’s more talent in there too.” \nAfter Tuesday’s result in the Bronx, the Jays knew they needed just one more win to seal the deal. \nMark Lowe is one of the few Jays to have gone through it before but this year he maintains is different. \n“I don’t ever remember being on a team where we won as consistently as we do,” Lowe said. “We sweep all the time. You go back and you look at it and say ‘Yeah, we swept two, three series in a row.’ Every team I’ve been on, every sweep you remember it but this team we do it so often, we’ve swept about 70% of the games since I’ve been here. \n“It’s been special and it’s a lot of different people coming up in big situations, not the same guy every night and I think those are the things you need to make it to the playoffs and all the way to the World Series.” \nThe fun may just be beginning.
