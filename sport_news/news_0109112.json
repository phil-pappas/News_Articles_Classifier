I pulled up into this driveway right here and then told her you need to get out, turn around and get out look for my wallet,\" Manziel says on the video. \"After that happened, she threw her phone out the window.\" \nAt some point, Crowley apparently tried to jump out of the car. \n\"I grabbed her arm, something like this,\" Manziel explained, \"'Hey, get in the car, get in the car, go home. I'll come back and find [our stuff] later.'\" \nAlthough police discovered an abrasion on Crowley's left wrist and both parties admitted to alcohol being involved, no one was charged in the incident. \nPolice found Manziel and Crowley and pulled the duo over after getting two separate 911 calls regarding Manziel's car. \nIn one call, you can hear the caller describe the situation. \n\"There's a lady in the passenger's seat trying to jump out. The guy is holding her, holding her neck,\" the caller said, via Cleveland.com . \nIn the other call, Manziel can he heard in the background saying that he's sober and that he's just \"trying to take [Crowley] home.\" \nAlthough Manziel said he was sober, he did later admit to police that he had taken some alcoholic drinks earlier in the day. \nThe incident last week comes only six months after Manziel spent 10 weeks in a treatment facility. \nBoth Manziel and Crowley took to social media to say that the incident wasn't a big deal. \nManziel was active for the Browns game against Denver on Sunday, a decision that Browns coach Mike Pettine defended on Monday, \"[Manziel] knows what's expected of him,\" Pettine said, via Cleveland.com . \"He's made huge strides around this building.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1LI3u2U TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:10:46.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
