Denny Johnstone headed a corner goalwards, but Wasps' frontman Michael Chopra was handily placed to nod the ball off the line.When Mickey Doyle fouled Michael Tidser, however, Ross Forbes eyed up his chance and curled a fabulous free-kick in from 25 yards.It proved sufficient to clinch victory as Alloa fell to a 10th defeat in 13 games.
