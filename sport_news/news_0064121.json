Since taking over the Panthers, Tallon has steadily followed a similar blueprint of rebuilding a floundering franchise through the draft, trades and free agency.\nWhile Florida's 3-2-1 start is far too premature to draw fair comparisons, there's no doubt last season's NHL-best 25-point improvement has earned the Panthers league-wide respect as a talent-laden team who's hard to play against.\n\"I'm proud in what we did as a staff in Chicago to make something special here,\" Tallon said Thursday. \"We're kind of mirroring Chicago a little bit; it's getting there. We've got 10 draft picks on the team right now and the goal is to get 15. … The future looks really good.\"\nIn Chicago Tallon was able to land franchise cornerstone star forwards Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane in back-to-back drafts (2006 and '07). They were joined by past picks such as Patrick Sharp, Duncan Keith, Corey Crawford, Bryan Bickell and Dave Bolland.\nTallon traded for goal-scoring forwards' Kris Versteeg, Martin Havlat and Andrew Ladd, but he felt the turning point was outbidding San Jose for defenseman Brian Campbell in 2008 ($57 million over eight years) after the 88-point Blackhawks nearly made the playoffs.\n\"To keep the momentum going that summer we got [Campbell], the best defenseman, so we made a statement with the huge contract and he got us to the conference finals,\" Tallon said.\nTallon then surrounded the young core with Stanley Cup champs such as Red Wings gritty forward Tomas Kopecky, Devils defensive stalwart John Madden and future Hall of Fame forward Marian Hossa who he said \"put us over the top.\"\nIt did indeed. The summer after Tallon joined the Panthers he convinced Campbell to accept a trade to while bringing in seven other veterans (no longer on Florida) on July 1, 2011.\n\"It's all how you draft the right pieces and make the right trades,\" Campbell said. \"Dale's always trying to tinker but he stood mostly pat this summer to let the team breathe. You have to have the right pulse on it and not keep making moves if you don't need them.\n\"There's definitely a good feeling in the locker room and confidence. Some of our young guys are leading the team a little more and are the go-to-guys now.\"\nThose go-to-guys are recent top picks such as Jonathan Huberdeau, Aleksander Barkov and Aaron Ekblad. Tallon then sprinkled in Stanley Cup ringbearers like Madden, Bolland, Shawn Thornton and his version of Hossa — Jaromir Jagr.\nMadden, an assistant coach for the Panthers, tempered the comparison.\n\"Certainly there are comparisons but you can't compare anybody to the Blackhawks for the past seven years,\" Madden said. \"I know Dale had his hand in that and he's laying the foundation for us, putting the blocks together. It's fun to watch and be apart of and obviously we hope we are the next franchise that the Blackhawks are. We got a lot of work to do.\"\nLineup shuffle\nIn an effort to get more offensive production, Panthers coach Gerard Gallant fiddled with the right wings on the second and third lines Thursday.\nGallant moved right wing Vincent Trocheck to the second line with center Nick Bjugstad and left wing Brandon Pirri . He shifted right wing Reilly Smith to the third line with center Dave Bolland and left wing Jussi Jokinen .\nGallant said he inserted defenseman Steven Kampfer in the lineup for the first time this season in place of Alex Petrovic partly because Petrovic made a few mistakes in the 3-2 loss to Pittsburgh.\n\"Last year Kampfer played real well and hadn't had a chance to play this year,\" Gallant said. \"There was some things I didn't like, but [Petrovic] has played good overall for six games.\"\n Ice Hockey Florida Panthers Chicago Blackhawks Stanley Cup Playoffs John Madden Free Agency Dale Tallon", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56299794/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-notes-1023-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:09:11.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
