By Mary Landers The recent epic rainfall that has plagued the East Coast packed an extra punch in coastal areas, where storm surge from the passing Hurricane Joaquin combined with rain to push tides even higher than expected.\nExactly how much higher is a question researchers are trying to answer to help predict future flooding.\nCaitlin Shea–Vantine documented Monday’s afternoon high tide on Tybee. Cellphone in hand, the Georgia Sea Grant Marine Education intern walked the area around Lazaretto Creek boat ramp, using a specially designed app to download the GPS coordinates of the high water mark.\n“There wasn’t major flooding, but it definitely seeped into the parking area,” she said.\nShe snapped photos and uploaded them to further document her findings, moving along to the Tybee pier, the back river and several high water lines along U.S. 80.\nVirginia-based Wetlands Watch developed the data-collection app called Sea Level Rise. University of Georgia Sea Grant and Marine Extension Service answered the call to pilot its use.\n“One of the tools we need to refine models is in past storms how high did the water level get?” said Mark Risse, director of Sea Grant and Marine Extension at the University of Georgia. “That data doesn’t exist. People don’t often document how high the water level got.”\nShea-Vantine and about six other volunteers used the app to record exactly how high the tide rose over the weekend. Instead of boots on the ground, these are boots in the wet sand.\n“You have to be walking on the edge of the high tide; you have to have your feet wet,” said Madeleine Russell, the Brunswick-based local government outreach coordinator for Georgia Sea Grant.\nThe Georgia effort will complement data sent from Florida through New York. The real-time flood mapping was the first of its kind, according to Wetlands Watch.\nIn Georgia, however, attempts to record data over the weekend met with some technical difficulties in logging into the app. With those details fixed, researchers added Georgia data Monday. They plan to add more with the coming king tides near the end of October.\nEventually Georgia Sea Grant plans to open up the data collection to citizen scientists — ordinary residents who want to help.\n“It’s ultimately a tool that’s something residents can use and they can say, ‘the water was here,’” Russell said. “It helps in emergency response. (Emergency managers) can say the water comes here first. You can’t always see in the landscape where water is likely to be.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14790379.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14790379.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:49:04.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
