The team said players and staff were evacuated from the hotel and by 6 a.m. everyone was given clearance to return to their rooms. \nA number of Panthers players tweeted about the alarm. Charles Tillman posted “Whoever pulled the fire alarm on the 16th floor….not cool.” \nThe Panthers (4-0) are trying to reach 5-0 for the second time in franchise history. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:35:23.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
