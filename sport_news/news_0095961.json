Loser donates to charity of winner's choice.\" \nHours later, Sankey - whose Twitter moniker is @GregSankey - responded, asking Moore if he was right- or left-handed and also inquiring about Moore's charity. \nMoore selected Virginia-based 501(c)(3) Operation Smile, which is an international medical charity whose global network of medical volunteers is committed to helping improve the health and lives of children from more than 60 countries. \nMost notably, Operation Smile has provided more than 240,000 free surgeries for children and young adults born with cleft lip, cleft palate and other facial deformities. \nMoore and Sankey crossed paths multiple times Wednesday during a hectic schedule of interviews and photo shoots for Tennessee's SEC Tipoff contingent. \nFinally, as the day's media obligations had come to an end, Sankey entered the hospitality tent outside the SEC Network studios, where Moore and fellow Vols senior Kevin Punter were waiting on a shuttle to the airport. \nSankey took a seat beside Moore and asked him about Operation Smile. After Moore explained why he had chosen that organization, the much-anticipated arm-wrestling match took place. \nAs cameras clicked, phone videos rolled and a throng of curious on-lookers watched, Sankey and Moore clasped hands and let their muscles fire. \nA workout enthusiast, Sankey held his own for several seconds. But his battle scowl soon gave way to a playful grin, as Moore gradually pressed the back of Sankey's hand onto the table top. \nThough Sankey lost the match, he undoubtedly cemented his standing as the \"coolest commissioner\" in all of sports. And Moore, along with Operation Smile, emerged victorious. \nLater Wednesday afternoon, Moore gave Sankey one last social media shout-out on Instagram. \n\"The arm wrestling challenge did happen! Me vs the SEC Commissioner! Thanks for allowing me the opportunity and shoutout to the best commissioner EVER for participating! Great experience today @SECNetwork\" \nBut the new head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers could not have felt more at home in his surroundings in Charlotte, and it had little to do with the location. \nBarnes seemingly knew everyone that he saw throughout the course of the day at the SEC Network studio and Ballantyne Hotel. He effortlessly weaved talking about his basketball team around stories about Dean Smith with SiriusXM radio, John Wooden tales with CBS analyst Seth Davis and a discussion of the NASCAR Chase to the Sprint Cup with Shannon Spake of ESPN. \n\"That probably tells you I've been around a long time,\" Barnes said of the familiarity. \"I think I've coached against most of these guys in the league. There are so many people, even at ESPN, that started when I started.\" \nBarnes has found himself suited well in his new position, a fact he repeated time after time in the rounds of interviews and show tapings throughout the day. He last coached in the southeast during his time at Clemson in the mid-90s, and being back in the region has allowed him to reconnect with people both inside and outside of basketball circles. His southern drawl has been right at home as well. \n\"Being back here has been great,\" Barnes said. \"The people in Knoxville have been great. Being back in this part of the country and recruiting in this region, I've been able to reacquaint myself with a lot of old friends that I've known for 40 years. It's been really good to be back.\" \nBeing back in the state of North Carolina also brought memories of coaching against UNC legend Smith, who Barnes famously sparred with during his ACC tenure at Clemson. \nDespite their on-court battles, the level of respect between the two was immense. When Smith retired, Barnes' daughter wrote Smith a letter to ask about his career and what was next for him. Smith responded to her letter within days, telling her about how much he thought of her father and the mark he was making on the court. \n\"Coach Smith did a lot of things like that,\" Barnes said after recalling the story. \"When the book is written on him, the things he stood for outside of basketball are the things he should really be respected for.\" \nBarnes also found a familiar face in taping his first SEC Network segment of the day. Seated next to him on the set was Ole Miss head coach Andy Kennedy, who Barnes recruited as an assistant coach at Alabama in 1985. \nBarnes took time during the segment to compliment the famously bald Kennedy on the head of hair he had as a high school player. \n\"I was kidding him about his hair,\" Barnes said. \"But he really did have a lot of hair.\" \nKennedy ended up at North Carolina State, later UAB, and Barnes was a head coach two years later. But Barnes still remembered the player Kennedy was and sees flashes of that in the coach he sat across from Wednesday. \n\"Just like he does now, he had an incredible personality and was one of those guys that the first time you met him, you felt like you had know him forever,\" said Barnes. \"He was a really good player, he was a big guard that could shoot and do a lot of really good things. There are so many guys I'm coaching against now that I did recruit.\" \nMore than just being back in his home part of the country, Barnes is happy to be in the SEC. He noted several times the renewed commitment to basketball across the league, pointing to the involvement of new Commissioner Greg Sankey. He also saw it in action as he visited with the other head coaches, including sharing a panel with Ben Howland of Mississippi State, Michael White at Florida and Avery Johnson from Alabama. \n\"There are some great things going on in this conference,\" Barnes said. \"It's a great time to be a part of it, and it's a great time to be a part of the University of Tennessee.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:34:51.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
