A victory represents keeping pace in a grueling SEC West division. Here are some highlights of what to watch for on Saturday night.\nNo. 21 Mississippi State at No. 14 Texas A&M\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Saturday\nWhere: Kyle Field in College Station\nRecords: Mississippi State, 3-1, 1-1; Texas A&M 4-0, 1-0.\nLast meeting: Mississippi State 48, Texas A&M 31 on Oct 4 2014\nTV: SEC Network\nWhat's on the line?\nSEC play continues with No. 14 Texas A&M hosting No. 21 Mississippi State Saturday night in College Station. Kevin Sumlin is in search of his first victory over a ranked conference opponent at home since arriving to A&M as the head coach for the 2012 season.\nSenior QB Dak Prescott has been efficient thus far in 2015, throwing for 1069 yards, seven touchdowns, and no interceptions for the Bulldogs. Mississippi State has also yet to allow a fourth quarter touchdown this season, giving up only six points in the final quarter of play.\nLooking to reverse those trends will be an A&M defense that has three picks on the year and has seen new life since the arrival of DC John Chavis. Meanwhile A&M sophomore QB Kyle Allen will aim for a strong fourth quarter in back-to-back games after his late game heroics helped A&M claim a 28-21 OT victory against Arkansas last week.\nWhen Mississippi State has the ball\nThe Bulldogs need a big day out of Prescott if they hope to claim their second conference victory on the road in as many weeks. Look for the senior signal caller to pay plenty of attention to his receivers on the outside. From the 6-foot-5 De'Runnya Wilson to Fred Ross, the team leader in receptions (22) and receiving yards (219), Prescott has the weapons to take on the A&M defense plus the ability to find and exploit mistakes.\nMississippi State does not place a huge emphasis on the run where its ground game ranks 98 th in the country and averages just under 145 yards per game. Brandon Holloway leads the team in rushing with 134 yards with junior Ashton Shumpert trailing shortly behind with 128 yards and a touchdown.\nWhen Texas A&M has the ball\nThe Aggies haven't had an issue with scoring points, but their situational offense could use some improvement. Though the team has scored on 21 of 24 visits inside the 20's so far in 2015, almost a third of those visits have resulted in a field goal rather than a TD. They will also aim to improve their third down conversion percentage that currently sits at .434.\nAfter managing only 16 plays in the first half last week against Arkansas, expect the Aggies to aim for a fast paced game and the Bulldogs to follow suit. Allen has road victories under his belt but can add a big win at home on Saturday while keeping his squad undefeated in the SEC.\nPrediction\nThough not completely silenced, A&M WR Christian Kirk has a quiet game with the Mississippi State secondary focused on the highly productive freshman, presenting an opportunity for another Aggie receiver to step up on offense.\nPrescott throws his first interception of 2015 but still plays like the player who claimed five total touchdowns against the Aggies in 2014. Allen has his second consecutive 300+ yard passing performance for the Aggies as the two squads trading blows through the air all evening.\nAfter managing just 28 yards on eight carries last week in Arlington, A&M running back Tra Carson gets back on track with 50+ yards.\nScore: Texas A&M 34, Mississippi State 28\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:04:17.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
