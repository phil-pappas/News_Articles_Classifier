Yet more indifferent results in that aforementioned trio of matches which come before another international break, and their promotion chances will start to look very remote indeed. \nAnd, perish the thought, another three defeats, and Jackett will find his position under intense scrutiny. \nThe fans have not turned on him yet (some have on social media, but Twitter is seldom an accurate reflection of the core fanbase) and, judging on the effort, spirit and determination displayed by his players against Middlesbrough, he hasn't lost the dressing room either. \nPoor results in the next run of matches and that may change. \nJackett is facing the toughest spell of his Wolves tenure. \nPositives, there were a few David Edwards celebrates giving Wolves the lead. \nWhat made this defeat so disappointing is that Wolves were so much better than in their miserable capitulation against Brentford three days earlier. \nThey took the game to Boro, matched them for quality and created more chances. \nThat they didn't win, let alone draw, was down to a combination of bad luck, heroic Boro defending and, typically for Wolves this season, individual mistakes at the back. \nBut for the first 71 minutes they were deservedly ahead and must take heart from their performance. \nKey to the improvement was team selection. \nJackett dispensed with the square pegs in round holes philosophy that, unsurprisingly, hadn't served him too well of late, and reverted to playing players in their best positions, particularly David Edwards and Benik Afobe, who were arguably the two best performers on the day. \nThe snubbing of Jack Price will have angered many, but Jackett wanted physicality against Grant Leadbitter and Adam Clayton and plumped again for Conor Coady. \nCoady certainly was physical and indeed incredibly fortunate not to have been sent off, but like so many of his team mates he raised his game from the Brentford defeat. \nLeaving James Henry out was the one that Jackett did get wrong though. On the flanks Nathan Byrne, pacey and with quick feet, showed flashes of what he can do and is worthy of seeing again next weekend, but Rajiv van La Parra didn't impress. \nThe Dutchman looked absolutely distraught to be withdrawn in the second half but, for all his running and endeavour, his lack of end product meant he could have no complaints. \nGolbourne back to his best Scott Golbourne. \nIt's been a tough 15 months or so for Scott Golbourne. \nBeset by injury last season, rendering his 2014/15 campaign an almost total washout, Golbourne has been trying to play his way into form since the start of pre-season. \nAnd against Middlesbrough he looked somewhere back to his 2013/14 vintage. \nHis peach of a cross for Edwards' goal was impressive, but the fact just he was in a position to receive Kevin McDonald's sumptuous defence-splitting through ball was just as pleasing, as his forays forward have been far too infrequent this season. \nHe also easily handled Emilio Nsue and continued to get forward in the second half. \nGolbourne is going some way to becoming a player Jackett can again rely on.
