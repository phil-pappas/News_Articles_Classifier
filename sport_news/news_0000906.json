But when he got out, he did something surprising for the McCollum family.\nDid you see anything suspicious in this #Everett community garden? Hay bale now where bench was. @KIRO7Seattle pic.twitter.com/O5LllUERbd\n— Joanna Small (@JoannaKIRO7) October 21, 2015 If you’ve never been in Bayside Park’s community garden, then you probably don’t notice anything awry.\nBut for the people who come there to remember Jenny, the hay bale sitting near its entrance is gut-wrenching.\nMary Belshaw runs the garden.\nShe says everyone remembers the crash that killed Jenny and two others—and everyone loved the bench her family put in the garden last year as a memorial, now replaced by a hay bale.\nTwo weeks ago, someone apparently loved it enough to take it.\n“You can’t just walk through here and take a bench, you have to have a truck and somebody helping you carry it,” Mary, who discovered the bench missing, told us.\nJenny’s husband talked to us just days after her death in 2003: “I’ll grieve but I won’t grieve in front of the camera,” Jerry McCollum told us then.\nThe bench was a place for others to grieve—including the man who killed Jenny.\nGrant Fosheim—just 19 when he caused the deadly wreck—was the first person to donate to the fund to buy Jenny’s bench; now it’s gone.\n“It’s a nice bench; somebody wanted it in their yard probably,” Mary said.\nShe says they likely didn’t know the old wounds they were re-opening, just like until now you likely didn’t know the heartache attached to the hay bale.\nIt probably just seemed like a comfortable place to sit.\nJenny’s family is looking for information about the theft.
