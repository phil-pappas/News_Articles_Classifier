Los Angeles (83-76) is a game behind the Astros and tied with Minnesota, which beat Cleveland, 4-2.\nHolland (4-3) allowed three hits and three runs in 6 1/3 innings for his first win since Sept. 5.\nDODGERS 3, GIANTS 2 (at San Francisco) — Brett Anderson pitched two-hit ball into the eighth in his final regular-season start, and NL West champion Los Angeles wrapped up its road schedule with a win,\nAnderson (10-9) retired 14 straight batters following Kevin Frandsen's one-out single in the third before Jarrett Parker singled to start the eighth. \nTim Hudson (8-9) allowed three runs and three hits in 2 1/3 innings in the final start of his 17-year big league career. The 40-year-old right-hander (8-9) is the majors' active wins leader for a few more days with 222 victories. He won his first World Series ring last season and has thrown 46,631 pitches against 13,005 batters.\nGiants reliever Jeremy Affeldt, 36, said he is retiring after the season, his 14th.\nTWINS 4, INDIANS 2 (at Cleveland) — Pinch-runner Eduard Nunez scored from third base on a wild pitch and Torii Hunter hit a sacrifice fly in the ninth inning for Minnesota.\nThe Twins scored a run in the eighth to tie it and then two unearned runs in the ninth off Cody Allen (2-5) to pull within one game of idle Houston for the second AL wild-card berth with three games left.\nCUBS 5, REDS 3 (at Cincinnati) — Austin Jackson hit a three-run homer to lead Chicago. \nThe homer upped Jackson's RBI count to eight in the last two games. \nAnthony Rizzo added an RBI double and Chris Denorfia also drove in a run as the Cubs kept alive their slim hopes for home-field advantage in Wednesday's wild-card playoff game, moving within two games of idle Pittsburgh in the race.\nJoey Votto's seventh-inning RBI single extended to 47 his streak of consecutive games in which he's reached base at least once, the longest since Kevin Millar's 52-game stretch in 2007. Votto's streak is second-longest in Cincinnati franchise history to Pete Rose's 48-game stretch in 1978, when he tied the NL record with a 44-game hitting streak.\nBRIEFS: Orioles SS J.J. Hardy, 33, said he has played with a torn labrum in his left, non-throwing shoulder this season. He added he does not plan to have surgery and will rehab before next season. … The Braves promoted assistant GM John Coppolella to general manager, giving him a four-year contract.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:32:07.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
