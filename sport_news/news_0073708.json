Baylor escaped with a 48-46 win over Texas Tech, but the close call probably hurt the Bears in the College Football Playoff assessment.\nSaturday's 63-35 thrashing of Texas Tech before 56,179 fans might not have offset those results, but it sent some definitive messages about this year's No. 5 Baylor team as it opened Big 12 play.\n\"I just think it showed we were ready, we were intense and we were determined,\" Briles said of Baylor's 28-point, 333-yard opening quarter.\n\"A lot of the team is a lot like me,\" he added. \"We're trying to prove we belong. A lot of people don't want us to belong. We're trying to prove we do.\"\nWho knows? Perhaps Saturday's thorough and balanced showing was a harbinger of Baylor (4-0) making a return to the Goodyear Cotton Bowl on New Year's Eve. Except in that case it would be in a CFP semifinal.\nBaylor opened this season by beating SMU, Lamar and Rice by a combined 123 points, but everyone knew Saturday would be the Bears' first true test. The Red Raiders were coming off a 55-52 home loss to No. 3 TCU.\nThis was the first time Tech (3-2, 0-2) faced top-five opponents in back-to-back weeks. Perhaps the Red Raiders were deflated from losing to the Frogs on a tipped touchdown pass with 23 seconds left.\n\"I don't think it had anything to do with mental strain,\" Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \"We just got beat by a very good team and didn't respond the way we needed to.\"\nAs CFP campaigning heats up, expect Bears fans to stress the one-sidedness of this common-opponent result. They'll also point out that Baylor rolled to a 42-14 lead with still 8:22 left in the second quarter -- and that it eased off the throttle and scored only seven fourth-quarter points.\nThis Baylor team continues to show more pass-run equity than other Briles squads. Or should we say run-pass? Baylor on Saturday gained 368 yards rushing and 312 yards passing.\nBears junior running back Shock Linwood's career-high 221 rushing yards Saturday were the third-most in Baylor history. Baylor's effectiveness on the ground enables junior quarterback and Garland High product Seth Russell to selectively dissect defenses.\nRussell on Saturday ran for career-bests of 81 yards and two touchdowns, while passing for 286 on only 15 completions. Four of those went for touchdowns, three to junior wide receiver Corey Coleman, a Richardson Pearce product.\n\"It's kind of funny,\" Russell said. \"You think Baylor, you think throwing the ball. When you look at the stats, it's pretty even, running and throwing.\n\"Being able to run the ball strong definitely opens up the pass game ... It puts a lot of stress on the defense.\"\nAs of Wednesday, at least one Las Vegas sportsbook had this game's over/under betting line for total points scored) at 901/2, which according to ESPN Stats & Information was the highest for a college game dating to at least 1990.\nEven casual, non-betting college football fans, though, would have been astute enough to take the over. Baylor brought into Saturday's game a 64.0-point scoring average; Tech 53.8.\nBy halftime it was Baylor 49, Tech 21, by which time the Bears had 499 yards of offense. The teams' combined point total reached 91 with 11:57 left in the game, when Russell threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Coleman, making it 63-28 Baylor.\nUnlike the Cotton Bowl loss to Michigan State, when, as Briles put it Saturday, Baylor \"stood right out there and got our butts beat, up 20 in the fourth,\" there would be no collapse.\n\"Each week we want to get better and not dwell on the last week,\" Linwood said. \"Each week is an improving week.\"\nIf the Bears keep improving at this rate, AT&T Stadium might be filled with a lot of green and gold come New Year's Eve.\nTwitter: @Townbrad\nBaylor 63, Texas Tech 35: Complete coverage\nBox score\nDiscuss this game and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday; ask questions now\nPhotos: Baylor shows up in grey, makes Tech pay in AT&T Stadium rout\nFive thoughts: Statement win for Bears?\nBaylor quotable: Art Briles says Bears 'trying to prove we belong'\nTownsend: Running Bears step over Tech on potential path back to Arlington\nBaylor's Linwood sets career high with 221 yards against Texas Tech\nFive thoughts: Sloppy play leads to another loss in the series\nTexas Tech quotable: Baylor WRs 'best group' Kingsbury has coached against\nTexas Tech defense has another lapse, allowing Baylor big yardage\nOn Twitter:\n @townbrad", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/townsend-running-bears-step-tech-potential-path-back-arlington", "http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/baylors-linwood-sets-career-high-221-yards-texas-tech", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-tech-defense-another-lapse-allowing-baylor-big-yardage", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-tech-quotable-corey-coleman-baylor-wrs-best-group-kingsbury-coached-seniors-rally-teammates", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/baylor-quotable-win-texas-tech-dominant-defense-exceptional-tough-red-raider-attack", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030079&home=79&vis=86&final=true", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesportsgallery/2015/10/03/photos-baylor-shows-grey-makes-texas-tech-pay-att-stadium-rout", "https://twitter.com/townbrad", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-sloppy-play-paces-texas-tech-fifth-straight-loss-baylor"], "published": "2015-10-04T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:37:00.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
