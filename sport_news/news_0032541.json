This one was worth the wait. The San Diego Gulls are back, this time as members of the American Hockey League, and much like their previous incarnations they won, beating the Grand Rapids Griffins 4-2 in front of a sellout crowd at Valley View Casino Center on Saturday night. Left winger Nick Ritchie, one of the jewels of the Anaheim Ducks system and one of the top goal scoring prospects in the entire NHL, got the first Gulls goal since 2006 on a power play in the first period. Ritchie scored twice in his San Diego debut. San Diego has a little time to relish its 1-0-0 record. They don't play again until Friday the 16 when Bakersfield comes to town.
