They get a season split with the Cowboys after a Week 1 debacle in Dallas. Don’t think for a moment that the Giants didn’t know what everyone was thinking after their nightmare performance in Philadelphia last Monday night.\nAnd don’t think they didn’t remember what happened a year ago, when a two-month spiral was sparked by one bad loss in the exact same place and time.\nOf course they knew. Of course they remembered. And of course they worried that it could happen again.\nBut what makes this Giants team different – at least what made them seem so different on Sunday – is that they refused to be defined by the mistakes of their past.\n“We really didn’t have a choice if we wanted to continue to keep this season going,” said wide receiver Rueben Randle, after the Giants’ big, 27-20 win over the Dallas Cowboys. “And especially to make this push into the playoffs, we needed this win. So everybody dug deep down inside and gave everything they had out there.”\nAs Tom Coughlin said, “It wasn’t pretty.” Not at all. The reality is they barely hung on to beat a Cowboys team playing without it’s quarterback (Tony Romo), it’s best receiver (Dez Bryant) and for most of the game it’s starting running back (Joseph Randle, who left with a back strain after two carries for 24 yards). The Giants got no pass rush. Their pass protection broke down. They gave up a ridiculous 233 rushing yards.\nBut none of that mattered because they also showed a true grit that has seemed to be missing more often than not the last few, playoff-less years. These Giants – these still-in-first-place Giants -- found a way. They created four turnovers. They got a 58-yard interception return for a touchdown by cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. They got a 100-yard kickoff return from ex-Cowboy Dwayne Harris. And from their beleaguered, battered and exhausted defense, they even got a huge fourth-quarter stop.\nKen Goldfield/Ken Goldfield Giants' Eli Manning and Cowboys starter Matt Cassell talk post-game. And remember, this is a team that blew the first two games of the season by not making the big plays in the fourth quarter. This time, they turned the tables on the Cowboys and made all of them – right up until the final minutes when Myles White recovered a muffed punt by Cole Beasley allowing the Giants to take a knee and run the final 1:26 off the clock.\n“It means a lot,” Rodgers-Cromartie said. “The first time we played, we should have won. You have a chance at the end and it’s the same thing, but they made a mistake and we were there to recover and finish the game.”\nThat first time, of course, was Opening Night when the Giants had the game in their hands and the ball near the end zone with two minutes to go. That’s when Eli Manning famously got confused, which led to him throwing a ball when he should’ve taken a sack, which gave the Cowboys a chance to rip through the Giants defense “like a knife through butter”, in Coughlin’s words, and pull off a gut-punch of a win.\nThe Giants weren’t going to let that loss define them either. They refused to be a team that choked in the end.\n“They fight,” Coughlin said. “They’re scrappy. Grit and scrappiness, that’s what we described ourselves as. And they are. They battle and they fight. I can’t say enough about that aspect.”\n“We are a scrappy bunch,” linebacker Jon Beason said. “I still feel like we’re leaving plays out there. We have a lot of room to grow. We’re happy about the win, but we know we can be better.”\nKen Goldfield/Ken Goldfield Reuben Randle makes a nice one-handed catch along the sidelines. Last year’s team was none of those things. They thought they were when they climbed out of an 0-2 hole with three straight wins. But when they lost in Week 6 in Philadelphia in awful fashion, it started a landslide that at one point looked like it might cost Tom Coughlin his job. They went from 3-2 to 3-9 in the blink of an eye, leading to a miserable December.\nThat team, with many of the same players, had no toughness when it mattered. This one does. And what they lack in talent and ability – particularly along the offensive and defensive lines – they make up for with that “scrappy” quality they keep proving they have. They say they’ve had enough of the losing, of the meaningless games late in the season. They want to again be part of a national conversation.\nThat’s why this win over the Cowboys, no matter how ugly, no matter how depleted the Cowboys were, was so important. A loss would’ve felt like the start of a 10 week death march towards another depressing end to the season.\nA win made all the difference in the world.\n“It keeps us relevant,” Coughlin said. “It keeps us in the hunt. It’s a happy group tonight. The exhilaration of victory, especially when most people tell you you can’t, that’s a great thing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:02.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
