A new billion-dollar riverfront stadium is being proposed in St. Louis, though it's unclear if the city will have an NFL team when such a stadium is finished. \nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:38:11.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
