Siguro malaking bagay din na na-involve ko yung teammates ko,” Ravena.\nActually, Ravena fell two rebounds shy of completing a triple-double as he also finished with 11 assists and eight rebounds.\nFor University of Santo Tomas to repeat over Ateneo, Karim Abdul (left) and Kevin Ferrer (right) should have to play solid in both ends when the two schools clash today in the UAAP at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. The Tigers rallied from a 16-point deficit to stun the Eagles, 68-58, in the first round. (Ali Vicoy)\nAnd that’s the major reason why Ateneo Coach Bo Perasol is upbeat going into their crucial showdown.\nPerasol said Ravena’s superb all-around game has rubbed off on his teammates and that he is expecting another solid efforts his role players.\nFor Dela Cruz, it’s all about keeping the team tightly knit.\n“Basta yung team at yung family namin kailangan every practice mag-improve kami. Every game kailangan nag iimprove din,” he said.\nHe’s also wary of the Blue Eagles as they had to storm back from a 16 point deficit in their first round meeting where they won, 68-58.\n“Pag-aaralan namin ng maigi yung game sa Ateneo. Kasi last time lumamang sila ng malaki,” Dela Cruz said.\n“Titignan namin kung ano mali sa game na yun at ia-adjust namin,” he added.\nWith a 3-6 record, NU needs to beat Adamson in their 2 p.m. showdown if it wants to turn its fortunes around.\nMeantime, Ateneo’s seldom-used forward John Apacible has apologized to school officials, coaches and teammates for his drunken rage last Sunday that gone viral last Monday.\nIn the video, Apacible was seen yelling expletives at the man who’s filming the video and claiming that he’s a councilor.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:56:25.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
