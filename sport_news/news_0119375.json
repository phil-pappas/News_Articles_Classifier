The officialâ€™s incorrect call allowed Australia's Bernard Foley to kick the winning points and advance to the semifinals. Controversial call helped Australia beat Scotland 35-34 \nJoubert awarded the decisive penalty for deliberate offside by Scotland's Jon Welsh from a lineout in the 78th minute, but replays showed Australia's Nick Phipps touched the ball, putting Welsh onside. The ref should have asked for an Australia scrum instead of the penalty kick, which sealed victory for the Wallabies. This is one play that cannot be reviewed by the video official. That play helped the Wallabies advance, and they are one of the four teams from the Southern Hemisphere to make up the semifinals. South Africa faces defending champion New Zealand Saturday, and the Aussies are up against Argentina Sunday.
