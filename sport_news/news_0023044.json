New York took a 2-1 lead into Game 4 Tuesday night at Citi Field.\nUtley was suspended two games for his rough slide in Game 2 that broke the leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada. He was on the bench and didn't play in the Dodgers' 13-7 loss Monday night.\nJohn McHale Jr., the baseball executive who will hear the appeal, informed MLB and the players' union of the timing on Tuesday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:56:31.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
