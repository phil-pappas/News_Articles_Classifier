What’s at stake this weekend is Michigan State’s seven-year dominance of the rivalry it cares about the most, a run of success that is now in serious jeopardy with Jim Harbaugh coaching at Michigan. \nKEY MATCHUP \nMichigan State QB Connor Cook vs. Michigan’s secondary. The Wolverines have shut out their last three opponents, and defensive backs Jabrill Peppers and Jourdan Lewis will pose quite a challenge for Cook. The Michigan State senior has thrown for 12 touchdowns and two interceptions this season. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nMichigan State: DT Shilique Calhoun. As stingy as Michigan’s defense has been, the Spartans may not have much room for error. Calhoun and Michigan State’s defensive front will be under a lot of pressure to shut down the running game and keep the Wolverines from building any kind of significant lead. \nMichigan: QB Jake Rudock. The Iowa transfer has thrown six interceptions this season, three of which came in a season-opening loss at Utah. He’s done a better job avoiding turnovers since then, and the Wolverines have shown how tough they can be to score on when the opponent doesn’t have a short field. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nThe team that rushed for more yards has won 42 of the last 45 games in this series. … Michigan State has held Michigan to one touchdown over the past three meetings. … Michigan is fourth in the nation in time of possession. Michigan State is 24th. … Cook is 29-3 as the starting QB for the Spartans. … Michigan has not allowed a point in its last 41 defensive possessions. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball@ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:09:18.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
