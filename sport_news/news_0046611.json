The second-year player finished with two tackles — including a nice stop on Bernard Pierce for a three-yard loss at the end of the second quarter. The most impressive thing about Easley's performance was his burst off the line of scrimmage. He was so fast off the snap on some plays that he shot into the offensive line before many of his teammates were even out of their stance. That’s a big reason the Patriots made him a first-round pick in 2013. When asked if his burst meant that the Dominique Easley of old was back, the 23-year-old said the best is yet to come. “Not yet. No. He’s not there yet,” Easley said. “I’ve still got to work and make some tweaks.” Easley hasn’t played as much football over the past couple of seasons as he would have liked. He missed most of his final season at Florida due to a torn ACL. Last year, he played in 11 games before finishing the season on the injured reserve. Easley opened up this season as a starter on the defensive line after an outstanding performance in the preseason. He suffered a hip pointer in the first defensive series against Pittsburgh and missed the next week's game against Buffalo. He said he has remained confident despite the small setback. Easley’s performance on Sunday was encouraging. He played 56 percent of the defensive snaps. “It felt alright. There’s always room for improvement. Felt alright,” Easley said. “I’m real excited just to get back to football.” nnn For the second season in a row, the Patriots added linebacker depth through the trade market. It worked out last season, with Akeem Ayers and Jonathan Casillas, and Bill Belichick tried his luck again this week when acquiring Jon Bostic from the Chicago Bears. This deal is similar to last year’s trade with Tennessee in which the team acquired Ayers. Both Bostic and Ayers are former second-round picks who had fallen out of favor with their former teams. But unlike Ayers, Bostic is under contract through next season. On Wednesday, Belichick talked about Bostic for the first time since the trade. “Jonathan has been a productive player, was very productive in college, started a bunch of games for the Bears,” Belichick said. “He’s played both inside and outside in the 4-3, athletic, runs well, smart, can play in the kicking game. I think he can potentially give us depth on all four downs.” Bostic started 17 games the past two seasons. In 2013, he was drafted two spots ahead of Jamie Collins in the second round. Belichick and Nick Caserio worked Bostic out at Florida during the predraft process. New item Players were quick to leave Gillette Stadium on Wednesday after the coaching staff informed them that they had Thursday to Sunday off for the bye week. The Patriots held one practice on Wednesday and that was it for Week Four. Some have questioned whether the timing of the bye week made it more of an annoyance than a help. The Patriots are off to a tremendous start and rolled through their first three games. Rob Gronkowski and Tom Brady were both asked if they thought the break would hurt the team's momentum. “That's hard to say,” Brady said. “We'll see how the season goes. It's a long stretch after this. There's no doubt about that. It's a lot of football games in a row, but that's what we work so hard in the offseason for. I think that's what you, physically and mentally, you have to be able to be all in.” “Whenever you get a bye week, you just have to take the positive out of it whether it’s earlier or later, it doesn’t really matter,” added Gronkowski. “At any time in the season, you could always use some rest in your body and heal up. “It’s not really that early. We’ve been through training camp, a couple games now. We’ve been going for about two months now. Just get off your legs, get some rest and just come back flying.” Gronkowski said his plans for the bye week were simple. “We just had a great practice today and now we got off for the rest of the week,” Gronkowski said. “So crash, watch movies, massages, get treatment, chill.” nnn In what is likely the Patriots only practice of this bye week, Ryan Wendell was once again the lone absence on Wednesday. The veteran offensive lineman has been dealing with an unknown illness to start this season. He still hasn’t appeared in a game. He missed every practice last week. Although he wouldn’t say what his ailment was, Wendell said last week he’s been grateful for treatment he’s received at Massachusetts General Hospital. The Patriots practiced inside the newly named Empower Field House. Players were in shells. “Today’s a day really to focus more on the Patriots than anything else,” Belichick said. “Just to work on things that we need to work on based on the first three games, practice situations, just things that have come up along the way that we need to clean up, go back, talk about a little bit, do a better job of coaching, do a better job of executing on the field, understanding the situations and in a way taking care of some problems behind us, but also trying to move forward into things that we think can benefit us in the future. That’s kind of where we’re at today.” When the Patriots come out of their bye week, they will have two road games at stadiums with retractable roofs, in Dallas and Indianapolis. “We’ll see if we can work on our timing and our execution a little bit,” Belichick added. “We’ve got a couple games coming up inside.” By Mark Daniels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:18:46.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
