The Penguins started 0-3 but have won their past two, both at home. Most surprising is Sidney Crosby registering no points in the five games. But Pens are loaded with scoring threats, including newcomer Phil Kessel. C Evgeni Malkin has goals in the past two games. Former Penguin Jaromir Jagr leads Panthers with four goals and seven points. Encouraging sign was C Brandon Pirri notching his first goal Saturday, as he tends to score in bunches. The Penguins have yet to score on the power play in 17 chances. The Panthers have converted five of 22 chances with the advantage, but are 0-for-9 on the road.\nâ€”Craig Davis\n Pittsburgh Penguins Brandon Pirri Craig Davis Evgeni Malkin Phil Kessel Jaromir Jagr Sidney Crosby", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56256d29/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-penguins-preview-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:57:47.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
