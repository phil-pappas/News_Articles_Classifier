Even Le Gavroche and the Ivy—two of London’s most hidebound dining establishments—have begun to give Brit bottlings a place at the table. I thought I should see for myself what wine country had to offer, so on a recent trip to London I ventured south for a weekend of tastings.\nEngland’s legacy of grape growing dates back to the Romans, but it’s only in the past decade that the country has begun to produce wine capable of rivaling international competition (still reds and whites are made here, but the sparkling wines show the most promise). Today, vineyards can be found all across southern England, though the southeastern counties of East and West Sussex and Kent showcase the best of what Britain has to offer. Vineyard-hoppers should be prepared to find a distinctly English experience: Instead of the more formal atmosphere of a tasting at one of Champagne’s imposing châteaux, visitors to English wine country may well have their Blanc de Blancs uncorked in a shed by a harried vineyard manager in muddy Wellingtons.\nAs you drive south from London on the M23, the landscape quickly opens onto the rolling, green hills of the North Downs. Within an hour or so, you can be at Bolney Wine Estate ( bolneywineestate.com ), a winery with the cozy, slightly ramshackle quality of a modest working farm. An agrarian-chic tasting room and cafe, designed to resemble a greenhouse, hides behind a couple of farm sheds at the end of a long gravel drive.\nENLARGE Lunch at the Milk House in Sissinghurst Photo: Vanessa Berberian for The Wall Street Journal The light-bodied Pinot Noir is a house specialty (few possess the daring to attempt red wine in the brisk British climate; fewer still succeed) but it’s the estate’s sturdy and easy-drinking sparkling wines—the Blanc de Blancs and Cuvée Rosé in particular—that are Bolney’s best. ¾\nBolney sits a few miles up the road from Ridgeview ( ridgeview.co.uk ), one of England’s most esteemed producers of sparkling wine and among the first in the mid-90s to spot the potential for Sussex to rival Champagne. It’s a low-key operation, and you’re far more likely to get stuck behind a tractor than a tourist bus on the single-lane road leading up to the winery.\nThe simple tasting room is found in the corrugated-metal shed that houses Ridgeview’s winemaking works, up a set of stairs from steel fermentation tanks and a monstrous press bought over from Champagne. But the wine doesn’t suffer for the lack of pomp and circumstance. Don’t leave without trying Ridgeview’s Fitzrovia, the sparkling rosé served to President Obama at Buckingham Palace during his 2011 visit.\nNearer the bustling little seaside city of Brighton, in the chalk hills of the South Downs, sits Breaky Bottom ( breakybottom.co.uk ). Visiting requires reservations, but it’s well worth the trouble. A mile and a half into the hills along rough, rutted farm track, vintner Peter Hall’s cottage is set among 6 acres of vines, from which he produces perhaps 10,000 bottles a year of improbably good sparkling wine.\nENLARGE Hush Heath Photo: Vanessa Berberian for The Wall Street Journal On a pleasant day, he might sit with you in his back garden over a glass of his Cuvée Tom Inglis Hall Sparkling Brut, rolling his own cigarettes and expounding on the past and future of English wine. Mr. Hall, who bears a striking resemblance to Donald Sutherland, started growing grapes here 40 years ago, when fewer than a dozen producers were active in the U.K.; while others were making middling white wines from workhorse German grapes and selling them at farm shops alongside ciders and sausages, Mr. Hall was tinkering with French grapes, both noble and little-known, like Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Seyval Blanc, a hybrid most popular in England and the American East Coast. The sparkling wine he releases today is toasty, crisp and dangerously quaffable.\nContinuing east, the South Downs level off into plains that sweep toward the sea. Gusbourne ( gusbourne.com ), an up-and-comer winery tucked away a few miles outside Rye, in Appledore, crushes enough Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes to produce around 3,500 cases of wine a year. Its vines, all Champagne and Burgundy clones, are trained tall and leggy to catch every drop of precious English sunlight.\nENLARGE “We’re not trying to imitate Champagne,” said Ben Walgate, Gusbourne’s C.E.O. “We’re trying to express our own English terroir. A long growing season gives us higher acid wines with a real depth of flavor.” The estate’s Brut Reserve is a terrific example of the fresh, tart apple palate emerging as England’s signature style.\nRye, a medieval port town with cobblestone lanes and tumbledown Tudor architecture, is an inviting place to spend the night (you can still go for a pint at the Bell, where Queen Elizabeth I once slept 500 years ago). Camber, just a few miles away, is another good choice, with a long expanse of rumpled dunes along the English Channel.\nTwenty minutes down country lanes and through one-pub villages, Chapel Down ( chapeldown.com ) is the country’s largest producer, selling over a dozen bottlings that range from light reds to dessert wine. It also offers a polished visitor experience complete with a retail shop and full-service restaurant. Its vineyard tours and tutored tastings provide a comparatively slick but comprehensive overview of the process from vine to bottle.\nBritain is a nation of die-hard walkers, so an English wine weekend wouldn’t be complete without a ramble through the vines at Hush Heath ( hushheath.com ), the 400-acre estate owned by property tycoon Richard Balfour-Lynn.\nThe estate offers self-guided vineyard walks to all comers; take a long wander through Bramley apple orchards and oak forest up to the vines, keeping your eyes peeled for resident albino deer on the way.\nMr. Balfour-Lynn has built himself a handsome, state-of-the-art winery, too, with an elegant tasting room. On your way out, stop in for a flute of Hush Heath’s award-winning Balfour Brut Rosé, which is already finding itself in heavy rotation at garden parties and summer sporting events throughout Britain. It makes for a fitting farewell toast.\nThe Lowdown // Sipping Your Way Through Southern England Getting There: The northern border of West Sussex is about an hour’s drive south of Central London.\nStaying There: The George is a stylish, modern B&B in the medieval seaside village of Rye ( from about $150 a night, including breakfast, 98 High Street; thegeorgeinrye.com ). The Gallivant, a renovated motel on a quiet stretch of road in Camber, throws off a chic New England beachcomber vibe ( from about $200 a night, including breakfast, New Lydd Road; thegallivanthotel.com ). Both have excellent restaurants that focus on fresh-caught seafood and local produce.\nEating There: In Ditchling, a cozy pub called the Bull is an ideal pit stop for a sandwich and a pint of Harvey’s Best, brewed in the nearby village of Lewes ( 2 High Street; thebullditchling.com ). Across the road, the Larder is stocked to the gills with artisanal foodstuffs from which to assemble the perfect picnic lunch (2 South Street; larder-ditchling.com ). Go for a full English breakfast at Hayden’s Coffee Shop in Rye ( 108 High Street; haydensinrye.co.uk ), or for a less wholesome start to the day, head straight to the counter at Knoops ( Tower Forge, Hilders Cliff, Rye; +44 1797 225838 ) for one of their legendary hot chocolates or milkshakes. The Milk House ( The Street; themilkhouse.co.uk ), in Sissinghurst, serves locally sourced dishes a notch above standard pub fare, such as farmstead pork sausages and wilted spinach.\nTasting There: Be sure to check each winery’s website before you go; some keep regular visitors’ hours while others are open by appointment only. Most welcome guests, but formal guided tours tend to be available only for larger groups.\nMore in Adventure & Travel Europe’s Steaks Get a Makeover Travelers Can Savor Touring Funen, Denmark’s Legitimate Fairy-Tale Island Mix Hiking and Hedonism at These Resorts The Day Trips Parisians Take Themselves A Tour of Chicago’s Bloomingdale Trail Road-Tripping Through Edward Hopper’s Maine", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO205_ODBH89_1000V_20150930111718.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH923_SPARKL_P_20150930122405.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH919_SPARKL_M_20150930121209.jpg", "http://haydensinrye.co.uk/Haydens/Home.html", "http://www.pinterest.com/wsj/wsj-adventure-travel/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH919_SPARKL_P_20150930121209.jpg", "https://www.bolneywineestate.com/index.php", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH923_SPARKL_M_20150930122405.jpg", "http://larder-ditchling.com/ldr/Home.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:33:44.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
