The best superstar: Andrew McCutchen. The best leader: Clint Hurdle. The best executive: Neal Huntington. The best story: A.J. Burnett. The best place: PNC Park. And, of course, the best team: the Pirates. So if all of these bests belong to the baseball club, we should consider that somebody else belongs in the conversation about what is best. What about Bob? Yes, that Bob. Bob Nutting, the sixth — and sharpest, if not most significant — owner of Pittsburgh's oldest professional team. You don't have to love him. You don't even have to like him. But, really, why wouldn't you? In only nine years, he has spearheaded the transformation of an awful organization into one whose influence will be felt throughout the major league postseason. The American League West champion Texas Rangers are managed by Jeff Banister, the Pirates' former bench coach. The Houston Astros, back in the postseason for the first time in a decade, employ the defensive-shifting philosophy the Pirates pioneered. However, if you really require proof of the Pirates' influence, look at the front office of their opponent for the National League wild-card game Wednesday night. From a management perspective, the Chicago Cubs have taken the Pirates' model and injected it with steroids. (Wait, steroids and Cubs … why would we possibly go there?) Facilities. Staff. Scouting. Development. Analytics. That's where the Cubs invest, just like the Pirates. And payroll, too — not that Nutting gets the credit he deserves on this topic. Adjusted for in-season moves, the Pirates spent about $98.9 million for players on the major league roster. That ranked 24th out of 30 clubs, and lowest in the NL Central Division by about $7 million. Still, only the St. Louis Cardinals have won more games than the Pirates' 280 over the past three seasons. The Cardinals have spent an average of $1.3 million for their 287 wins. The Pirates' wins have come at an average cost of $939,172. The Cardinals routinely draw over 3 million fans to Busch Stadium. The Pirates set their home attendance record with 2,498,596. Let's not pretend there is level playing field. Let's not pretend there is one in Pittsburgh, either. The Pirates don't live in the luxurious salary-cap world like the Penguins and Steelers. The Penguins missed the Stanley Cup playoffs in three of their previous nine seasons before the NHL adopted a cap for 2005-06. The Steelers were in the playoffs for three of their previous nine seasons before the NFL instituted a cap in 1994. It's no coincidence that Pittsburgh's mid-sized market hockey and football teams experienced their second great eras after their respective leagues capped payrolls. Given how he has turned around a moribund franchise, I'd love to see how Nutting would compete as an owner in a baseball world in which spending was capped. Instead, I'll point out the Pirates' 431-379 record over the past five years. They've increased their win total in four of those years. The Steelers haven't done that. Neither have the Penguins. And that's not to suggest the Rooney family or Ron Burkle and Mario Lemieux are bad owners. They're not. But we tend to ignore those owners' rough starts while we hold Nutting responsible for all 20 years of losing Pirates baseball. He was owner for only six of those years. Now his is a model franchise, with most of Pittsburgh's bests. What about Bob? Nutting might be the best thing about the Pirates. Rob Rossi is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
