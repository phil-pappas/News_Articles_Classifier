But sometimes life doesn’t go your way. Obviously, I’m super-hungry to get out there and compete.”\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nHolland, a transfer from Duke, planned to start her career with the Buckeyes in the fall semester of 2014. Instead, she suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee during practice on Oct. 31.\nThose kinds of storm clouds require more than an umbrella and raincoat to overcome. Holland already had torn an ACL in her left knee in high school and had other surgeries on her legs and a shoulder.\n“For any player who loves their sport, it’s really hurtful when you can’t participate,” she said. “For me, I thought I had to live through everybody else last year.”\nThe star player from Seneca, S.C., became a cheerleader and a shoulder to lean on for a young Ohio State team. Everyone apparently noticed and appreciated.\nWhen coach Kevin McGuff announced the captains this month, he listed Holland with senior guards Ameryst Alston and Cait Craft. The players, he said, did the voting.\n“For me that was a tremendous honor because I know that I haven’t played a game in college,” Holland said. “That meant the world to me because I really do support all of these girls. I think they were able to see that last year when you can’t play.”\nMcGuff was not surprised.\n“That really speaks to her character and the respect she has with the team,” he said. “It is a unique situation. One of the things about her is that she is always positive. When things do go wrong, she stays positive. I think that is one of the things our players really love about her. She is a really good leader.”\nHolland credits Alston for helping her cope in the days and weeks after she was hurt last season.\n“Ameryst was always very supportive,” Holland said. “She checked in on me and made sure that I was doing OK all through that whole process.”\nFreshmen Makayla Waterman and Chelsea Mitchell also had suffered preseason ACL injuries. The three formed “Club Rehab” and stayed positive through sessions in the training room.\n“You never know how people will receive (advice) with you not playing,” Holland said. “But I do feel that ‘Club Rehab’ as a whole had garnered enough respect from our teammates when we were healthy that they did appreciate our input after we got hurt.”\nAlston said that Holland’s energy and attention to detail were hard to miss.\n“As soon as she set foot on this campus and from the very first practice, she has always been very engaged,” Alston said. “She’s vocal, and that’s something we need from one of our leaders.\n“I’m not very vocal. That’s something I’m working on this year. I’ve always led by example. It doesn’t really matter whether you’re a leading scorer or whether you don’t play many minutes. If you do what’s in the best interest of the team, that’s all that matters.”\n@jmassie@dispatch.com \n@MassDispatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:50:34.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
