He planted it and it just buckled.\" \nDavenport, 6-0, 240 pounds, was in his first season as Lamar's quarterback. He completed 31 of 49 passes for 636 yards with 13 touchdowns and no interceptions and rushed for 612 yards and 10 touchdowns on 66 carries. Defensively, he had 33 tackles, including 11 for a loss, 1 sack, 1 fumble recovery and 1 blocked punt. \nJones said Davenport will be out at least four months. \nSenior Dusty Wilkins, the Warriors' starting running back, has been moved to quarterback. Wilkins, 5-10, 180, did not attempt a pass after replacing Davenport in Friday's game but rushed for 73 yards and 1 touchdown on 10 carries . He has 467 yards and 6 touchdowns on 47 carries this season. \nWilkins was the starting quarterback for Lamar's undefeated junior high team in 2012. \n\"He's done that in the past,\" Jones said. \"I don't feel like our offense will change much.\" \nJones said junior Isaac Felkins, 5-11, 180, will start at inside linebacker. Felkins has 36 tackles. \n\"Isaac is going to have to step up and do a good job for us,\" Jones said. \"Everybody has to pick it up.\" \nThe Warriors (7-0, 4-0) beat Charleston for the first time in program history and will travel to Danville on Friday. \n\"We talked all year about facing adversity whenever bad things happen,\" Jones said. \"The kids reacted well. They played hard. They really stepped up.\" \nHARDING ACADEMY \nRamblers forfeit \nRose Bud has forfeited Friday's 2-3A Conference game at Harding Academy because of low numbers. \nThe Ramblers (1-7, 0-5) are down to 14 players because of injuries, Harding Academy Coach Roddy Mote said Tuesday. \nMote said Rose Bud Coach Kevin Coleman called him Monday to confirm the forfeit. With the forfeit victory, Harding Academy (8-0, 5-0) earns 13 points in the standings, which are used for playoff tiebreakers. \n\"They were trying to wait as long as possible,\" Mote said. \"I know they hated to do it. It's not what they wanted to do.\" \nFriday was scheduled to be Harding Academy's homecoming game. Mote said homecoming activities will still take place despite not having a game. \nThe Wildcats have won 50 consecutive conference games dating to 2008. \nENGLAND \nJunior achievements \nEngland's undefeated start can be traced to a solid junior class. \nLed by quarterback Brayden Brazeal, the Lions (7-0, 4-0 5-2A) have averaged 45.5 points and have scored at least 27 points in all 7 victories. \n\"They just grew up,\" England Coach Terry Farmer said. \"They practiced hard this summer. You have to have luck. You have to catch some breaks.\" \nBrazeal, 6-0, 150, has completed 89 of 132 passes for 1,495 yards with 19 touchdowns and no interceptions. \nFarmer said he has been impressed with Brazeal's efficiency, which has been helped by a receiving corps that includes juniors B.J. Thompson, 6-6, 200, and Marc Westbrook, 5-10, 145, and senior Xavier Iverson, 5-10, 180. \n\"He's efficient because he's careful about who he throws to,\" Brazeal said. \"We played 7-on-7 all summer. They jelled together. They're running their routes with good timing.\" \nEngland, which shut out Cutter Morning Star 58-0 last Friday, hosts Mountain Pine on Friday. Farmer said he has been pleased with the maturity his team has shown and hopes the Lions can keep their run going into the Class 2A playoffs, which begin Nov. 14. \n\"We want to get better throughout the week and put a good product out there on Friday,\" Farmer said. \"I hope we're making England as proud as we can. \nBALD KNOB \nGulledge in charge \nThe return of junior running back DeShawn Gulledge back has turned Bald Knob into one of top teams in the 2-4A Conference. \nGulledge, who rushed for more than 900 yards and 11 touchdowns as a sophomore in 2014, missed the first two games with a fractured wrist, which he injured in Bald Knob's spring game earlier this year. Coach Randy Johnston said Gulledge wore a brace for a couple of weeks before returning in Week 3 against Riverview. \nGulledge rushed for 123 yards and 5 touchdowns on 11 carries and caught 6 passes for 76 yards last Friday in a 35-21 victory over Mayflower. \nBald Knob (4-3) went 0-3 in nonconference play but has won four consecutive and is tied for first place in the 2-3A with Harding Academy. \nJohnston said the importance of Gulledge's return can't be denied. \n\"It's a big, big deal,\" Johnston said. \"It lets us spread the field.\" \nBald Knob hosts Barton on Friday and finishes up the regular season with games against Marianna on Oct. 30 and at Harding Academy on Nov. 5. \n\"We have to stay healthy and stay focused,\" Johnston said. \"We can't look down the road. We have to take care of what's happening right now.\" \nEXTRA POINTS \nGreenland (7-0, 4-0 1-3A Conference) is the only Class 3A team to allow fewer than 100 points this season. The Pirates have allowed 78 points in seven games and have shut out three of their past four opponents. They beat Marshall 39-18 last Friday behind Alex Sisemore 's 198 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Greenland hosts Green Forest on Friday. ... Richard Merritt rushed for 305 yards and 3 touchdowns on 28 carries in Earle's 48-14 victory at Salem last Friday. Markese Brown caught 5 passes for 120 yards and 1 touchdown. ... The 6-3A Conference's top teams meet Friday when Smackover (5-2, 4-0) visits Camden Harmony Grove (6-1, 4-0). The Buckaroos beat Fordyce 35-28 at home last Friday, while the Hornets went on the road and routed Lake Village 41-6. \nSports on 10/21/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:19:04.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
