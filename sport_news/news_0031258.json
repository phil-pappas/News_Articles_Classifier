He's the heart and soul of this club.\"\nThe Blue Jays scored a run in the fourth on an infield hit by designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion that brought home left fielder Ben Revere, the first Blue Jays run against Gallardo in his three starts against them this season.\nChirinos put the Rangers ahead 4-1 with a home run to left in the fifth after Odor was hit by a pitch for the second time.\nThe Blue Jays scored twice in the fifth on doubles by catcher Russell Martin and center fielder Kevin Pillar before Bautista belted a home run in the bottom of the sixth to cut the Rangers' lead to 4-3.\nOdor restored the two-run lead when he lined a one-out homer to right in the seventh that ended the scoring.\n\"I liked the effort and I liked our intensity,\" Martin said.\n\"They played a little better than we did. Everybody's different. I'm over it and ready to come out tomorrow.\"\n(Compiled by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:12:01.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
