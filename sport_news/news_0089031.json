The Wholesale Price Index-based inflation was (-)4.95 per cent in August. It has been in the negative zone since November. In September last year, inflation was 2.38 per cent. Inflation in food articles inched up to 0.69 per cent in September, from (-)1.13 per cent in August. Onion and pulses turned costlier with inflation at 113.70 per cent and 38.56 per cent respectively during September, as per official data released today. The rate of price rise in vegetables was at (-)9.45 per cent as against (-)21.21 per cent in August. Inflation rate in fuel and power segment was (-)17.71 per cent, while that in manufactured products was (-)1.73 per cent in September. Besides pulses and onion, the food items which became dearer in September were eggs, meat and fish (2.02 per cent), milk (2.16 per cent) and wheat (3.34 per cent). However, potato inflation was low at (-)57.34 per cent. The inflation data for July has been revised to (-)4.0 per cent, as compared to provisional estimates of (-)4.05 per cent. The Reserve Bank mostly tracks the Consumer Price Index- based inflation for its monetary policy decisions. The CPI or retail inflation for September rose to 4.41 per cent, from 3.74 per cent in the previous month. The rise in retail inflation as well as the marginal upward movement of wholesale inflation is unlikely to have a bearing on the monetary policy of RBI. The central bank has signalled that it would wait for sometime before cutting interest rates. Last month, RBI had reduced interest rates by more than expected 0.50 per cent and said it expects CPI inflation to reach 5.8 per cent in January 2016. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:15:40.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
