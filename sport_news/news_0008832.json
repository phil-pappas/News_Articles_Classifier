Flamengo, who wanted to climb the ladder and to be in one of the top G-4 positions, remains in seventh place in Brasileirão Série A table.

Figueirense finished up in fifteenth position, with 34 points. \n“There was a difference of attitude, team spirit, posture. Today Flamengo was no shadow of what it was, for example, against Joinville. It is a question of needing time to work. We’ve been here less than two months, we had some good games, very good, but the team today was really unrecognizable. It was a night to forget,” said Flamengo coach Oswaldo de Oliveira after the game. \nThe team , however, benefitted from the victory of fellow Cariocas, Fluminense. Playing against São Paulo on Wednesday night at home at the Maracanã , Fluminense triumphed in a 2-0 win. \nWith goals from Fred and Marcos Júnior, the locals finished up in eleventh position in the table with forty points. The Paulistas remain in fifth place with 46 points. \nIt was Fluminense’s twelfth victory in the competition. In the next round, they will play against Belo Horizonte team, Cruzeiro, at the Mineirão on Sunday Octobter 18th. On the same day Flamengo will take on Internacional at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio.
