( Live streamed on Yahoosports.com , 6:30 a.m. PT/9:30 am ET, no local TV broadcast )\nThomas has helped the Jaguars offense since his return two weeks ago, but they lost to 31-20 to Houston last week. The Jaguars (1-5) are trying to snap a four-game losing streak overall. The defense has struggled, allowing at least 30 points in three of the last four games and the unit is allowing 29.3 points a game, 30th in the NFL.\nThe Bills (3-3) continue to have problems, least of all being their 34-21 loss at home to the Cincinnati Bengals last week. Injuries have hurt the team. Starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor will miss his second straight game with a sore knee and E.J. Manuel will start. Manuel was inconsistent in the loss to the Bengals.\nRunning back LeSean McCoy looks healthy after gaining 90 yards against the Bengals. However, wide receivers Percy Harvin remains sidelined with what coach Rex Ryan calls a \"personal issue\" and Sammy Watkins is out with a injured left ankle.\nIf you wants to watch Thomas and the Jaguars face the Bills, here's what you need to know:\nWhat: Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Buffalo Bills\nWhere : Wembley Stadium, London, England\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 25, 6:30 a.m. PT/9:30 a.m. ET\nTV : No local broadcast\nWatch online : You can watch the live stream on Yahoosports.com .\n-- Geoffrey C.
