For a team with aspirations of winning the NBA title, McHale turned to a then-20-year-old rookie center that had missed training camp and spent most of his season on a minutes-restriction arrangement with the D-  \n“Every day in practice, he kept doing enough good stuff to where I decided at the end of the season I would throw him out there,” McHale said. “He got into the games, performed very well and locked down a spot.” \nAfter playing 38 games with the Vipers last season, Capela returns to the Valley tonight, likely the starting center in place of an injured Dwight Howard for the Rockets’ third preseason game against Orlando at 7 p.m. at State Farm Arena. \nCapela wasn’t supposed to necessarily be at this point this quickly in his career, but he is because of a strong performance during last season’s playoff run for Houston. \n“His ability to help through a long playoff run was impressive,” McHale said. \nPROVING HIS GAME \nAfter dealing with a groin injury almost all last season, the 6-foot-10, 245-pound Capela averaged 3.4 points and 2.5 rebounds on 67.7 percent shooting in 7.5 minutes during the playoffs. The surprise, however, was that he was playing at all. \nDrafted 25th out of the first round by Houston in 2014, the Rockets were expected to stash Capela away in Europe for at least one season before joining the team. But he was persistent in playing with Houston sooner than later, and the Rockets were content to let him develop in the Valley. \nCapela played all 17 playoff games last season and contributed as a finisher and shot-blocker as the Rockets beat Dallas and the Los Angeles Clippers before falling to eventual champion Golden State in the West finals. Now he enters his second season as the fulltime backup center to Howard. \n“I proved to myself I could play at this level, at a high level,” said Capela, who had 12 points and 14 rebounds in the Rockets’ preseason win against Dallas on Wednesday. “The playoffs gave me a lot of confidence for this year.” \nDuring his time with the Vipers, Capela progressed slowly from his injury. First, it was a 20-minute restriction. Then 25, then 30. He averaged 16 points and 9.7 rebounds while providing plenty of highlights because of his raw athleticism. \n“I’ve come pretty far, but I’m not impressed,” Capela said. “I know I’m serious about the game and I need to stay focused. I need to keep listening and learn as much as I can.” \nDuring the offseason, Capela hit the weights and embraced a nutritional plan. He looks bigger and stronger. \nCapela said he is a better screener, rolls harder off those screens and makes better pocket passes out of the post. He said he is also a better rebounder. He actively pursues the ball instead of just letting it come to him like he did last season. \nCOMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT \nWhen asked if he expects to be back in the D-League again, Capela is direct: “No.” He’s comfortable. He’s confident. \nAnd McHale is comfortable and confident in him. \n“He’s getting better all the time,” McHale said. “For our system, he does a lot of good things for us. I like him at that (backup center) spot and it’s going to be a big role. We want Dwight to make sure he can play as many games as he can, and with his health and still taking care of him ... there are going to be nights where I’m sure we’ll sit Dwight and Clint will be ready.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:55:01.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
