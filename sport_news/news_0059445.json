I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game.\" \nHis most scrutinized comments came when asked about possibly returning to pro-bowl form on the field: \"I hope to come out guns blazing.\" \nWhen told about his phrasing surrounding guns, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told SI.com \"oh my goodness\" but later noted to ESPN that guns aren't allowed on the field, adding \"we all know that's just a way of expressing yourself. I hope his guns are ablazin.\" \nAs for Brady, he took the high road, reportedly saying Hardy is a great talent, that he's focused on playing and \"I really don't care about his personal feelings.\" \nCopyright   5:38PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:53:51.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
