Bedard Twitter Email Posted: Thu Oct. 1, 2015 While the Week 4 slate of NFL games leaves a lot to be desired, there are plenty of interesting storylines across the league. From Michael Vick running the Steelers’ offense after just five weeks of work, to two stud running backs (Marshawn Lynch and LeSean McCoy) that may need to be replaced, to the Falcons getting ready to pile up the wins against a weak schedule, to the hype over Bill Belichick’s offensive line rotation to Carson Palmer going against a Rams pass rush that ended his season last year, there’s plenty to discuss and analyze.\nWe’ll get into those topics, plus 10 thoughts heading into Week 4, but first we’ll start this installment of Blanket Coverage with the first of a two-part roundtable with three generations of coaches about something that should be concerning the rest of the league: the state of the NFL’s offensive line play. With Ben Roethlisberger, Tony Romo, Drew Brees and (now) Andrew Luck on the mend, it sure seems like a good time to talk about the line.\n• KAPLAN: Mike Sherman coaches on Cape Cod | BENOIT: Week 4 notes\nOver at least the past couple of seasons, offensive line play in the NFL has been criticized by many as being subpar. This year hasn’t exactly been a banner season, as star quarterbacks such as Ben Roethlisberger , Tony Romo , Drew Brees and Andrew Luck are already dealing with injuries, with some out for stretches of the season. In addition, the 3.96 yards per carry average through three weeks would be the lowest for an entire season since 1999 (3.90).\nTo get a sense for where line play stands for those that coach it, I made my annual pilgrimage to the C.O.O.L. Clinic (C.O.O.L. stands for coaches of offensive linemen) where hundreds of coaches from peewee football all the way to the NFL gather each May in Cincinnati.\nI sat down with three generations of line coaches to get their views: Alex Gibbs, the semi-retired legendary godfather of the zone blocking scheme; Paul Boudreau, the Rams ’ offensive line coach who is in his 29th NFL season; and Joe Gilbert, who is in his third season directing the Colts and spent several years on the college level.\nThis is the first installment of a two-part roundtable.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nWhat is your opinion of the state of offensive line play in the NFL right now?\nPaul Boudreau : I don’t think it’s what we’ve been used to. I think the hardest thing I see is the way we have to practice now because of the rules that are put on our coaching staffs. I know when Alex came into the league and I came into the league, it was all about your pad level, staying down. How do you keep your pad level down? You practice in pads. And the rules and the way the collective bargaining has been with what the owners agreed to, it's put a lot of stress on line coaches, offense and defense. I think you have, by the third or fourth preseason game, you look at your tape and you're still playing too high. If you don't practice in pads and you're always in “underwear” and you can't go against the defensive line but once or twice a week in pads, you're going to be behind. In the 1980s and '90s, you came out of training camp, you were ready to play on day one. Now, by the third or fourth game, you can tell that your guys are still not there. That's what I see, and it's by the rules of the game.\n• KING: Mailbag: How Elway built the Broncos' D | Week 4 fantasy rankings\nAlex Gibbs : I think that is very true. Part of it was the way we coached then. We coached so hard and so tough it was nasty and the players, when they had a chance to get it corrected, they wanted it. The other thing that makes it a little different is we've got the best proving ground in college football, but of late, the college game has become a game of the quarterback running and a throwing game that is not a training ground. You literally have to start over in those phases.\nNFL Video MythBusters: Are spread offenses the cause of offensive line decline? by Doug Farrar", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/GregABedard"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:04:48.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
