QB’s possible return could be spark vs Wolfpack By HANK KURZ Jr. -   \nVirginia Tech is looking for a spark, and may have a surprise on Friday night. \nThe Hokies (2-3, 0-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) will face North Carolina State (4-1, 0-1), and quarterback Michael Brewer is listed as probable after missing the last four weeks with a broken left collarbone. \nThat doesn’t mean that Brewer will play, but the possibility could give Virginia Tech a needed jolt. Hokies coaches and trainer Mike Goforth said this week it will likely be a game-time decision. \nCoach Frank Beamer took the blame last week for a lackluster effort as the Hokies opened their ACC season with a 17-13 loss to Pittsburgh. Virginia Tech gained just 100 yards, its lowest total since Beamer’s first game 29 seasons ago, and allowed Brenden Motley to be sacked seven times while he also threw three interceptions. \nThe Hokies are struggling against top competition and have won just one of their last seven at home against teams from Power Five conferences. \nBeamer said looking at film of the Pitt game was eye-opening because of the Hokies’ lack of fire. \n“We downed a couple balls, one on the 1-yard line. It was a heck of a play,” Beamer said. “And everybody got up and it was like business as usual. And I said, that’s not the way we need to be playing. What you need to be is emotional. It needs to be fun. And that all starts with me.” \nThe Hokies also are trying to overcome the shadow of three consecutive subpar seasons by program standards, while the Wolfpack doesn’t have that kind of burden, but is trying to erase the memory of last week’s loss to Louisville. \n“I think it was out of our system by the time I woke up today,” left tackle Joe Thuney said Monday. “Woke up this morning just eager to get the taste out of our mouth and play another game and focus on Virginia Tech.” \nThere also is reason for optimism for the Wolfpack. \nQuarterback Jacoby Brissett has completed better than 73 percent of his passes, and he’s gone 217 throws without being intercepted dating to last November. And tailback Matt Dayes is averaging better than 104 yards per game and has already run for 10 touchdowns, giving him 28 touchdowns on the ground in his career. \n___ \nHere are some things to watch when North Carolina State plays at Virginia Tech: \nWHO’S BEHIND CENTER?: Despite being sacked seven times last week, Brenden Motley is more mobile that Michael Brewer. If the Wolfpack gets their pass rush going like Pittsburgh did a week ago, the Hokies have to decide whether to risk playing Brewer, who had a steel plate and six screws surgically inserted in his collarbone just a month ago. \nBALL CARE: Turnovers could be the decisive factor in this one, and that would seem to favor the Wolfpack. They have turned the ball over just three times, all on fumbles, through five games; the Hokies have given it away seven times. The Hokies will try to rattle Jacoby Bissett into making a few more mistakes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:24:54.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
