I think it makes me concentrate more. I probably focus more,\" said Norris. \n\n\"I only realised how the scoreboard looked after 17. I was a little bit nervous heading into 18.\" \n\nNorris overcame a three-shot deficit to beat Tabuena, who was again frustrated after he lost a play-off at the event in Taipei last year. \n\n\"How many times do I have to finish second? It is frustrating but I'm still happy with the way I played,\" said the Filipino. \n\nSouth Korea's Kim Gi-Whan, Taiwan's Hsu Hao-sheng of Chinese Taipei, Keith Horne of South Africa and Thai duo Panuphol Pittayarat and Natipong Srithong tied for third place. \n\nLeading scores (par 72) \n\n204 - Shaun Norris (RSA) 68-68-68 \n\n206 - Miguel Tabuena (PHI) 68-65-73 \n\n208 - Kim Gi-Whan (KOR) 69-71-68, Panuphol Pittayarat (THA) 68-71-69, Hsu Hao-sheng (TPE) 69-70-69, Keith Horne (RSA) 69-68-71, Natipong Srithong (THA) 70-65-73 \n\n209 - Antonio Lascuna (PHI) 70-69-70, Danny Chia (MAS) 71-67-71 \n\n210 - Wang Jeung-Hun (KOR) 72-68-70, Prom Meesawat (THA) 70-70-70, Berry Henson (USA) 70-70-70, Lu Wen-teh (TPE) 68-71-71, S.
