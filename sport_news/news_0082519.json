(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) more > By TIM BOOTH -   \nSEATTLE (AP) - The status of Washington freshman quarterback Jake Browning is in question for Saturday’s game at No. 10 Stanford after he suffered a shoulder injury late in the Huskies’ loss to Oregon. \nWashington coach Chris Petersen said Browning was “day-to-day” on Monday, the typical designation Petersen gives for any player who has not suffered a long-term injury. \nBrowning appeared to injure his right shoulder on Washington’s next-to-last possession, which ended with a touchdown pass from Browning to Jaydon Mickens to pull the Huskies within 26-20 with 3:35 left. \nWhen Washington got the ball back with 1:11 remaining, K.J. Carta-Samuels was in at quarterback while Browning was having his shoulder tended to on the sideline. Petersen said after the game that he didn’t believe it was a significant injury but did not elaborate Monday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:39:12.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
