They won it, so I only have good memories so far. \n\"It would be surreal [to play at Wembley]. I'm really looking forward to it, to the challenge. I'll just keep working as hard as I can in training and hopefully I can get some minutes on Friday.\" \nTottenham signed Alli from MK Dons in January and then loaned him back to the then third-tier club for the rest of the season. \nThe teenager has had little trouble adapting to life in the Barclays Premier League. \nHe scored on his second appearance for Spurs and has played in seven out of eight league games for the club this term. \nAlli was preparing for a Europa League game last week when Mauricio Pochettino told him he had been named in Roy Hodgson's squad for the double-header against Estonia and Lithuania. \n\"The manager at Tottenham spoke to me the day before we played Monaco and asked if I wanted to play for the Under-19s in the Euros,\" Alli said. \n\"I obviously said I would if I could, but I thought I was too old. \n\"When [the senior squad] was officially announced I was in the hotel in Monaco preparing for the game so didn't want to think about it too much and didn't want to look at my phone. \n\"I had a look after the game, though, and all my friends had texted me and I spoke to my family straight away.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:09.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
