This year's event included rain and overall wet conditions. \nRockport â€” In miserable weather better suited for ducks or any water-loving creature, there was no singing in the rain for the dozens of high school cross-country runners who braved tough conditions to participate in the annual Camden Hills Invitational on Friday afternoon, Oct. 9. \nWhile no singing was heard, there were plenty of youngsters who stepped into mud puddles on the slick, rain-saturated course, which is unique because it finishes with a lap around the track in front of the bleachers. \nPlenty of colorful umbrellas were out among fans in the dreary weather for Camden Hills' homecoming weekend event. \nBesides host Camden Hills, Oceanside of Rockland/Thomaston, Lincoln Academy of Newcastle, Medomak Valley of Waldoboro, Belfast, Brunswick and Morse of Bath participated. \nBrunswick's Tessa Cassidy (19:43.46) beat a field of 44 finishers in the girls race and Brunswick and Morse's Christopher Wallfield (17:01.47) first among 72 finishers in the boys race over the sloppy course. \nThe Belfast boys and Brunswick girls were the team winners of the event. \nThe girls team scores were: Brunswick 21, Lincoln Academy 60, Camden Hills 62, Belfast 84 and Oceanside, Medomak Valley, Morse no score. \nThe boys team scores were: Belfast 53, Brunswick 57, Camden Hills 60, Lincoln Academy 83, Morse 84, Oceanside 185 and Medomak Valley no score. \nClick for photos from this meet. \nSee more photos below. \nThe individual Midcoast girls results were: 3, Emily Jolliffe, Bel, 21:12.20; 9, Lauren Rothwell, CH, 21:51.25; 12, Alli Wells, CH, 22:11.31; 14, Emily Kessel, CH, 22:21.68; 15, Zoe Deans, Bel, 22:32.66; 19, Katherine Dailey, CH, 23:21.20; 20, Macy Pushaw, CH, 23:23.29; 21, Emily Davis, Ocean, 24:15.62; 23, Tamaelle Lawson, CH, 24:21.05; 27, Acadia Calderwood, Med, 26:07.88; 28, Brianna White-Ortiz, Ocean, 26:25.95; 29, Sophie Love-Webb, CH, 26:33.90; 30, Gia Davila, Bel, 26:35.05; 31, Molly Davis, Ocean, 26:48.56; 33, Mirelle Lafreniere, CH, 26:53.57; 34, Hannah White, Bel, 26:54.56; 36, Kaitlyn Kessel, CH, 27:04.15; 37, Natalie Owre, CH, 27:47.74; 39, Cora Lindell, CH, 27:53.01; 40, Sophia Landry, CH, 28:00.37; 41, Leah Yarbrough, Bel, 28:38.67; and 42, Matilda Biscaldi, CH, 28:43.62. \nThe individual Midcoast boys results were: 4, Caleb Love-Webb, CH, 17:47.57; 5, Ricky Smith, Bel, 17:50.60; 6, Patrick Groening, Bel, 18:09.71; 9, Kyle Wood, CH, 18:36.43; 11, Stanley Sturgis, Bel, 18:46.05; 13, Eli Smith, CH, 18:51.97; 14, Ben Winchenbach, CH, 18:53.21; 15, Daniel Bubar, Med, 19:03.57; 16, Tyler Noyes, Bel, 19:10.80; 17, Brendan Moline, Bel, 19:16.55; 21, Simon Fedarko, CH, 19:25.59; 24, Michael Kremin, CH, 19:38.18; 27, Jackson Winslow, Bel, 19:52.91; 30, Alex Morsey, Bel, 20:07.18 29; 33, Jordan Bickford, Bel, 20:27.55; 37, Leo Kalajian, CH, 20:45.44; 39, Leander Andrews, Bel, 20:50.99; 40, Will Karod, CH, 20:55.44; 42, Tyler Bartlett, Bel, 21:09.60; 43, Hunter Hoskins, CH, 21:21.62; 44, Tyler Bowman, Med, 21:24.46; 46, Gabe Wright, CH, 21:46.39; 49, Nathaniel Morsey, Bel, 22:07.16; 50, Noah Howard, Bel, 22:08.14; 51, Kevin Miller, Bel, 22:17.73; 53, Ian Moriarty, CH, 22:40.96; 54, Adam Bifulco, CH, 22:51.09; 57, Devindale Reynolds, Bel, 23:16.36; 58, Aaron Fuller, Bel, 23:17.26; 59, Nick Cammelieri, CH, 23:57.52; 61, James Brayall, Bel, 24:13.72; 62, Daly Winterich, Ocean, 24:13.91; 63, Drew Bubar, Med, 24:14.38; 64, Nick Mahar, Ocean, 24:27.49; 65, Dylan Reese, Ocean, 24:31.09; 66, Patrick Corcoran, Ocean, 24:31.23; 67, Noah Thomas, Bel, 25:29.77; 68, Jeb Fountain, Ocean, 25:37.04; and 70, Sam Gosinski, Bel, 29:14.77.
