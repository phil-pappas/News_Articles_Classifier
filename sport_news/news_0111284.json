Frederick Breedo / Getty Images Oct 20, 2015 at 1:09a ET 0Shares \nThe season-ending injury suffered by Tennessee Titans center Brian Shwenke in last Sunday's loss to the Miami Dolphins will force the team to start two rookies along the offensive line this week against the Atlanta Falcons . \nAndy Gallik , a sixth-round pick out of Boston College, will make his first NFL start against the Falcons. Gallik took over for Schwenke after the veteran dislocated his left ankle in the second-quarter against the Dolphins. \n\"He got better as the game went on,” Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said of Gallik, per the Tennessean . “He struggled a little bit early. He got picked on a stunt one time on which the guy came free and got a sack. But he did a little better as the game went on. We’ll look at options, what we can possibly help to address that, and see where it is going forward.” \nGallik will join fellow rookie Jeremiah Poutasi in the starting lineup. Poutasi was benched after giving up three sacks against Miami, but Whisenhunt said Monday he would remain the starter at right tackle.
