Image 11 of 11 Woes continue for UAlbany football in loss to Maine 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Albany\nThe University at Albany had $10 million in the bank and a sellout crowd of 8,500 in the house for homecoming at newly named Casey Stadium.\nThe good feelings evaporated quickly once Maine kicked off Saturday afternoon.\nThe Great Danes fell behind by 20 points in the first quarter en route to a 39-7 beating in a Colonial Athletic Association contest.\nUAlbany (2-4 overall, 1-2 CAA) has lost its past two games by a combined score of 76-7.\nThe Great Danes were shut out 37-0 at Holy Cross a week earlier. And even a return home to face a program UAlbany has fared well against over the years wasn't enough to change the team's fortunes.\n\"I just think we're trying to grind through it,\" UAlbany second-year head coach Greg Gattuso said. \"I'm not an excuse-maker, but sometimes you've got to look at our situation. Right now, it's rough and it's hard. We are fighting our tails off, I can promise everybody. If anybody thought going into this level of football that we're in is going to be easy, it's not. It's a battle every week.\"\nIt was the Danes' first game since naming the stadium after Tom and Mary Casey , an Albany couple whose daughter and son-in-law last week gave a $10 million donation — the largest in the history of the university — to UAlbany athletics.\nBut the money does nothing in the short-term to address UAlbany's shortage of experience, depth and talent. The Great Danes have several players out due to injury, or suspension in the case of talented sophomore wide receiver Josh Gontarek , who's away from the team indefinitely after his arrest two weeks ago.\nAfter a surprising 7-5 record in Gattuso's first season, the Great Danes appear to be headed in the wrong direction this year with the schedule only getting tougher from this point on.\n\"There's a reality of where we're at, depth-wise with recruiting and things like that,\" Gattuso said. \"We've had one full year of CAA recruiting. We're going to continue to recruit good players and good student-athletes.\"\nThat said, Gattuso told his players Friday night that it was the first time this season he'd felt great going into a game.\nImagine his surprise when Maine had a 20-0 lead and 213 yards of offense before UAlbany even had a first down.\n\"We've just got to be more prepared to get into it right away,\" UAlbany sophomore quarterback DJ Crook said. \"The turnovers didn't help today, especially the one in the first quarter, putting the defense in a bad position.\"\nThe Great Danes were already behind 13-0 when Crook threw a pass intercepted by Maine linebacker Sterling Sheffield at the UAlbany 36. The Black Bears converted the turnover into Nigel Beckford 's 1-yard scoring run for a 20-0 lead with 4:43 to play in the first quarter.\nMaine (2-3, 2-1) had its way in the opening quarter against a UAlbany defense missing linebacker Colin Cooper and safety Kyle Sakowski , in addition to the season-ending injury to linebacker Mike Nicastro .\nBlack Bears quarterback Dan Collins , with only a 48.2 completion rate coming in, was 21 for 28 for 208 yards and a touchdown. He completed a 51-yard strike to Micah Wright on a post pattern, beating UAlbany cornerback Rayshan Clark , to set up Maine's second touchdown.\n\"We saw during the week their safeties were susceptible to play-action (passes), so we took our chances when we had them,\" Collins said.\nClark finished with a team-high 18 tackles for UAlbany. That's not a good sign, considering he's a defensive back.\nClark insisted the Great Danes still can turn around their season, even with 16th-ranked Villanova coming to Albany on Saturday.\n\"It's going to come down to heart,\" Clark said. \"Coach preaches heart. Don't let the (lows) be too low and the highs be too high. We've got to go out there and want it more.\"\nUAlbany scored its only touchdown on a 6-yard pass from Crook to Zee Roberson with 2:21 left in the first half. UAlbany had a chance to get more, but Crook threw an interception at the Maine 48 in the final minute that the Black Bears turned into an 18-yard field goal and a 23-7 halftime lead.\nThe capacity crowd watched Maine backup quarterback Drew Belcher throw two touchdown passes in the second half.\n\"We hope (the fans) keep on supporting us,\" Crook said. \"We really appreciate them coming out. It was awesome to see them out there. It's disappointing, but I hope we get better every week.\"\nmsingelais@timesunion.com • 518-454-5509 • @MarkSingelais", "external_links": ["http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772441/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772437/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772443/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772437/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772434/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772437/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772442/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772439/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772440/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772434/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772438/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772438/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772439/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772441/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772435/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772440/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772440/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772442/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772436/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772435/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772434/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772443/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772435/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772442/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772436/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772439/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772441/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772436/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772438/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/55/8772443/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:56:56.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
