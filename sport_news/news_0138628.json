The NCAA then says that Saunders arranged for the test supervisor to alter answers for the recruits to improve their test score.\nSaunders is also accused of paying for a recruit's expenses while at a two year-college.\n“We take the allegations very seriously and have fully cooperated with the investigation,” said ULL Athletics Director Scott Farmer. “We’ve been committed to finding the truth as much as the NCAA.”\nDr. Joseph Savoie, president of UL Lafayette, said that he respects the NCAA enforcement process and commends the Athletics Department for being open and cooperative.\nYou can find the NCAA's notice of allegations to ULL , and ULL's response to the allegations by following the links.\nCopyright WAFB 2015.
