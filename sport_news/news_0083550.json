(AP) â€” Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera says defensive end Jared Allen will miss Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks after sitting out the entire week of practice with a pinched nerve in his back.\nWes Horton will start in Allen's spot.\nRivera said Allen might have played had this been a playoff off.\nThe Panthers also ruled out backup middle linebacker A.J. Klein (concussion) and offensive tackle Daryl Williams (knee).\nAllen was injured during the Panthers' first game against Tampa Bay in Week 4. He has been experiencing numbness in his legs ever since.\nThe Panthers will get middle linebacker Luke Kuechly and wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery back on Sunday. Kuechly has missed the last three games with a concussion, while Cotchery has missed two games with a sprained ankle.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
