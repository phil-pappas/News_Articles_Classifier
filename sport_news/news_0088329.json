But Bagley faded into the background once the season began, catching two passes in just four appearances. Then this fall, Louisville's new receivers -- Jaylen Smith, Ja'Quay Savage, Jamari Staples, Traveon Samuel and Devante Peete in particular -- got all the attention through the first half of the campaign.\nSaturday's 17-14 win over Boston College put some of that spotlight back on Bagley, now a sophomore who says he has realized the value of practice. He caught three passes for 69 yards, including one grab that went for 39 yards.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nInstant Analysis | Cards hold off BC\nSmith's apparent arm injury left a void for Bagley to fill. And his hard work in practice, quarterback Lamar Jackson said, paid off in big ways. Only Staples, who had four catches for 96 yards, had more receptions or yards.\n\"It felt great to be able to get a chance to play,\" Bagley said. \"I've been waiting for my chance.\"\nPetrino said Bagley is still learning a game that is relatively new to him. It certainly didn't help that Bagley, who grew up in Vero Beach, Fla., played in a run-focused offense in his two years of high school ball.\nBut there's no denying the 6-foot-3, 192-pound wideout's potential, and Saturday's win showed what it looks like when Bagley puts it all together.\n\"It was great to see Bagley step in and make plays for us,\" Petrino said. \"He's a guy who really didn't start playing football until he was a junior in high school. He's extremely talented, but he's kind of just learning the game. He keeps getting better. When Jaylen got hurt, it was great to see him come in and make plays for us.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4754721602e9fb7405c2aa1823b4371f441d0aae/c=986-0-2996-2010/local/-/media/2015/10/24/Louisville/Louisville/635812965394499747-USATSI-8880354.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:44:08.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
