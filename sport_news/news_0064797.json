After Harvey completed warmups and was about to throw out the first pitch, home plate umpire Greg Gibson came out to the mound to talk to Harvey. Dodgers manager Don Mattingly quickly came out of the dugout as the umpires conferred. Terry Collins followed shortly thereafter. After about five minutes of grumbling, the game finally got underway at 8:42 p.m. after first pitch was scheduled for 8:37. The delay didn't seem to bother Harvey, who sat down the Howie Kendrick, Jimmy Rollins and Adrian Gonzalez in order. \nBottom of 1st: Brett Anderson followed Harvey's strong inning by retiring the Mets in order as well. Curtis Granderson grounded out to Anderson, David Wright struck out and Daniel Murphy flied out to centerfield. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nTop of 2nd: Former Met Justin Turner got the first hit of the game with a single to centerfield.
