(Photo: Eric Gay/AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas — Alabama’s offense had stalled and appeared out of sync following the loss of senior center Ryan Kelly to a concussion. \nAt the same time, Texas A&M had seemingly stolen all momentum by taking advantage of several Tide miscues to pull within a single score at 28-20 four minutes into the second half. \nAlabama (6-1, 3-1 SEC) needed to do something to right the ship. \nAnd with a single 13-play scoring drive that lasted more than six minutes midway through the third quarter, the Tide offense found itself once again, thanks in large part to a pinball-like run from senior quarterback Jake Coker to start things off and a gutsy fourth-down call from offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin. \n“Hey, it worked. I’ll take it,” Coker joked after Saturday’s 41-23 victory over previously-No. 9 Texas A&M. \nThe drive began with a first-down scramble from Coker, whose disgust for avoiding contact saw the senior bounce off multiple A&M tacklers on a 5-yard run. \n“At that point in the game, we really needed something, and I just tried to do what I could for the team,” said Coker, who finished with 138 yards on 19-of-25 passing while adding 11 net rushing yards on seven carries. \n“I don’t like sliding, I think it’s kind of crazy especially (because) when you get close or somebody’s close and you start sliding, (defenders) want to get one in on you — I don’t believe in sliding.” \nNeither does bruising junior tailback Derrick Henry, who followed Coker’s run up with a pair of big gains on a 10-yard run and an 18-yard reception in two of the next four plays, but a missed assignment by backup center J.C. Hassenauer resulted in a 7-yard loss for a second-and-17 situation. \nTwo plays later, after an 11-yard run by Henry and a 4-yard completion by Coker, the Tide were backed into fourth-and-2 at A&M’s 30-yard line, within field goal range for Alabama kicker Adam Griffith. \nAs seconds ticked away on the play clock, and Coker still making adjustments at the line at 3 seconds left before it’s a delay of game penalty, Alabama head coach Nick Saban tried to call a timeout. \nOnly, the always-confident Kiffin stopped him, throwing up a quick stiff arm to halt the four-time national championship-winning coach in his tracks as Hassenauer snapped the ball with less than a second to spare. \n“The shot clock was down to 1,” Saban explained regarding his intention to call timeout there, before almost cracking a smile as he joked: “I’m glad we didn’t.” \nJust as the play clock hit zero, Coker pitched it to Henry 7 yards behind the line of scrimmage, and the 242-pound running back did the rest, sprinting to the 20 for an all-too-easy first down. \n“It’s called a flip play, you put everybody in the box and act like you’re going to run power and you flip the ball to a guy and he outruns everybody,” Saban said playfully. “It’s a good play. … It’s a risky play, if somebody comes off the edge you’ve got a tackle for a loss.” \nOnly that never happened. \nWhat did happen was Alabama managed to put points on the scoreboard four plays later, ending a nearly 27-minute scoreless skid from the Tide offense as Griffith nailed a 32-yard field goal to make it a two-score advantage at 31-20 with 3:04 remaining in the third quarter. \n“We just kept going, we played it safe with the ball and made sure we just kept it going,” Coker said of the 13-play, 51-yard drive. \nAfter the third of four interceptions by the Crimson Tide secondary helped set up another Griffith field goal for a 34-20 lead early in the fourth quarter, to effectively shift the momentum back in Alabama’s favor for good. \n“We’d like to finish those drives, but Griff did a pretty good job making some field goals today, and I think that was big,” Saban said. “I think you have to take points when you can get them and make the multiples as difficult (as you can) for a team that can score as quickly as (Texas A&M) can.” \n(8) ALABAMA VS.
