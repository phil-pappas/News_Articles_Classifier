And the people who believe Kirk Cousins is either a promising future starter, or even just the best quarterback on the current roster, largely argued that Cousins was done in by his fallen wide receiver, just moments after an impressive game-tying drive. \nJay Gruden offered a sort of complicated, blame-free explanation of the play, in which the turn monster played the villain \n“Kirk had to get rid of the ball quickly,” Gruden said. “He threw the ball before Ryan Grant turned around and when Ryan Grant was about to turn around he stumbled. Whether it would have been complete, whether it still would have been intercepted, we don’t know. Ryan just got a turf monster and fell down. Kirk felt the need to get rid of it. He didn’t want to take a sack there in a big situation, so that’s what happened. It was just an unfortunate play.” \nThe skeptics were not convinced. If Kirk Cousins shot Lincoln, Jay Gruden would find a way to excuse it. \nCousins, meanwhile, also was unable to say what would have happened had Ryan Grant not fallen down. \n“I think it’s hard to say,” Cousins said. “Again, on the film, it looked like the ball was outside of Ryan in a way that, even had he not fallen, he would have had to jump to the outside to make the catch. If he falls and the ball’s right on him, in theory it should still be right in his general area where he can make the grab. But, tough to say. That’s where it’s tough.” \nWhich brings us to Chris Cooley. The ESPN 980 host and Redskins Radio Network analyst gave his version of events Monday afternoon. He did not side with the Cousins doubters. ( Listen here .) \n“There are three types of people judging this play, ok, three types,” Cooley said. “Let’s start with morons I’m fine with. You think Ryan Grant has no chance to make the catch? Fine. [It’s] your right to your opinion. You’re a moron. You say Kirk Cousins just throws up a pick, and you really, really, truly believe that that’s just a bad football play by a quarterback? You’re a moron. I’m fine with that. You’re wrong, but I’m fine with that. \n“Second person,” Cooley went on, and please bear in mind that radio hosts are allowed to be entertaining, so don’t get all insulted. “You have some kind of vendetta or hope that Kirk Cousins fails for whatever reason, and you’re arguing it because of that. You’re an ass. \n“Or you’re three, which is realistically what happened on the play,” Cooley said. “Here’s what happened on the play. This is where I’m at. It is an 8-yard ‘Scout’ route or ‘Hook’ route with a pivot to the outside. So it’s not a hitch, and in the game my call was a hitch, but it’s also hard to see in the game, in the timing of how fast it was. It’s an eight-step “Out,” in which he’s pivoting coming back out of the route. Not turning right around. So Kirk didn’t miss wide, wild outside with Ryan Grant breaking inside. He’s breaking to pivot outside. \n“Ryan Grant takes seven steps,” Cooley said. “On his sixth step he is already peeking his head back towards the quarterback, starting to look. He then takes his seventh step, planted it in the ground, out in front of his knees and chest, and he gets his leverage leaning wayyyy back at a back angle, and as he comes to come out of it, slips his feet out from underneath him. \n“Now, the ideal type of route in this situation is eight-yard step, steps shoulder over toes, head down, not telegraphing that you’re going to turn around there, and hard , immediate break out of the route. That’s what your quarterback expects. That’s what your coaching staff’s coached. And that’s where Kirk throws the ball, expecting him to be. \n“Now there are two things if he runs this route right. He bats it down, doesn’t catch it, but his body’s in front of the defender. Or it’s a catch. And I think it’s a catch. I don’t think the ball’s that bad. I think it’s actually a catch. If you want to criticize Kirk Cousins on this play, criticize him for throwing it hot, and taking that throw to Ryan Grant, which by the way is normally a low-risk throw that this team completes over and over and over. You’ve seen them complete these throws throughout the season so far. \n“He ends up having an extra nickel DB walk to the outside edge of his left protection. He’s got two defensive lineman — an end and a D-tackle — inside of that, and on the right side he’s got another D-tackle, an end, and a linebacker who showed early but has already walked back. \n“Kirk could immediately pause there and re-slide his line to the left side. He could stop and say whoa whoa whoa, check check check check, 300 instead of 200 , and they make a slide, and they slide the line left. They slid the line right. Kirk knew he slid the line right, so he knew he was hot. He threw hot. He didn’t look the throw down, he didn’t stare it down. A hot throw is take ball, plant, throw. That’s not a quarterback giving away the idea that you’re throwing. … So you lose the game, in which you fought your [innards] off, and that’s just a bummer, unfortunate way to lose it.” \nCooley later asked on Twitter how one should refer to people who believe Cousins was to blame for the interception. As you’d guess, many people said you should call them morons, and many people said you should call them realists. Dan Steinberg writes about all things D.C. sports at the D.C.
