But many face challenges and bullying in schools.\nThe tour made a stop at Stapleton elementary this afternoon after a presentation at Aurora Junior High School this morning.\nThe big screen presentation features movie clips and music surrounding a message about making good choices, believing in yourself and standing up to bullies. Students see real life stories of hope and inspiration. Students say they like the format and agree the message is needed.\nLillie Carrier, a fifth grader at Stapleton said after the show, \"It's inspiring to us kid.s and we have to learn how to live up to those expectations. We have choices we can make: we can be the bully, the victim, or we can be the person that helps the victim.\"\nAnother fifth grader Kaya Cooper says, \"I think that people should start standing up because it doesn't matter really what people think of you, because you know who you are and your friends do too. So you should not listen to them, you should stand up and not be scared.\"\nThe students say they've experienced bullying in some way or another and say it happens in all schools.\n The Livin' Life videos are viewed by more than a million students across the country. The tour stops at Soaring Heights elementary and at Baxter Springs schools tomorrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:28:06.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
