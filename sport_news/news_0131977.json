The Wildcats broke a 13-game losing streak in Missoula, a record that stretched all the way back to 1987. \nThis is a big deal. \nUnder second-year head coach Jay Hill, the Wildcats are winners of three of their last four games and a record of 5-4, going back to their first win last season. The win over Montana puts the Cats one win above their win total for the entire 2014-15 campaign, with five more games left to play. \nTo put this even further into perspective, the Wildcats have not won three or more games in a season since 2011-12, the last year that legendary coach Ron McBride was at the helm (5-6 overall record). \nMuch of the Wildcats' recent success can be attributed to the running game. In each of their three wins, the team has had a player with 100-plus rushing yards on the game. \nMuch of the load has been carried on the shoulders of running back Eric Wilkes. The 5-7, 200-pound junior has looked unstoppable this season, and did so again Saturday as he ripped through Montana defenders for 112 rushing yards and one touchdown on the night. \nWilkes has made a huge jump from his freshman campaign, coming in on limited touches behind senior running back Bo Bolen. Wilkes rushed for 184 yards on the season, a mark he has already eclipsed midway through this season. \nWilkes is also pulling double duty for Weber as the No. 1 option on kickoff returns, averaging 30.7 yards per return, including a 100-yard kickoff return touchdown against North Dakota State. \nWilkes looks to have gained the confidence of his coach and the team and has transformed into the player who will get his number called when the team needs yards. \nOf course Wilkes isn't alone out there. Quarterback Jadrian Clark has made an impact this year on the ground, racking up 128 yards with his feet, 84 of them coming in the win over Montana. \nFreshman running back Treshawn Garrett has moved the ball very well, putting up 271 yards on 67 attempts for the season, including an impressive 101-yard performance against Sacramento State. \nA great deal of credit for the success on the ground can be attributed to the Weber State offensive line. Led by 2014 All-Conference center Joe Hawkins, the line has opened up huge seams for the running backs to do their work. \nThe offensive line has also protected the quarterback well, allowing no more than a single sack per contest in the last five games. Several of Clark's runs have come simply as a result of the excellent protection provided by the offensive line. \nWeber State has a chance to have its best season in the past four years, with a real chance to finish with a winning record on the season. Three of its remaining five games are at home, and the Wildcats own all-time winning records against three of the remaining opponents. \nWith North Dakota coming into Stewart Stadium this Saturday, the Wildcats will have the opportunity to build on the euphoria from the Montana win. \nLook to Weber to rely on its ground game throughout the remainder of this season to pick up the victories it needs. If the team can cut down the number of penalties, its chances are very good to finish above .500 for the first time since 2010.
