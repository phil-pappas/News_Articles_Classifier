St. George finished first. \nRockland — For middle school children, the allure of pizza can be a powerful thing to ignore and during the fun-filled Busline League golf championship scramble on Tuesday, Oct. 6 at the Rockland Golf Club, one Midcoast team resisted that temptation while another did not. \nSo, ultimately, that opened the door for St. George Elementary School, which might have prevailed anyway, to drive through to the school's first league title. \nClick for photos from the championships. \nSee more photos below. \nThe foursome of Parker Hilchey, Drew Minery, Evan O'Neil and Derrik Emerson combined to shoot 41 for nine holes and win the school's first golf crown. \n\"The night was mostly for the kids to have fun, although there was some competition too,\" said Garrett Hilchey, the Dragon coach. \nCamden-Rockport Middle School finished second with 43 and Great Salt Bay of Damariscotta third at 44. Oceanside also participate but did not finish its round. \nGolfers played the front nine holes at RGC. \nAccording to coach Hilchey, Oceanside's foursome was playing well and possibly in position to win the competition, but the group decided not to finish its round, skipped the final two holes and did not complete a team score, thus taking themselves out of the running for the top spot. \n\"So they ended up going in to enjoy the pizza party instead of maybe winning the event,\" said coach Hilchey. \nA reception for the youngsters was put on by Marcia Flanagan. \nFor the championship scramble, St. George, coached by Garrett Hilchey included Parker Hilchey, Minery, O’Neil and Emerson, while Oceanside, coached by Kevin Martin, included Carson Murphy, Darik Johnson, Dom Carver and Ella Andrews. Camden-Rockport, coached by Alex Plummer, included Sawer Olsen, Greyson Orne, Ezra Lemole and Hunter Longley, and GSB, coached by Kyle Feltis, included Dawson Wall, Garrett Day, Will Farrell and Chase Gregory. \nThe remainder of the CRMS golfers were Lilliana Gaudette, Gardener Griffin, Jacob Longley, Joshua Kohlstrom, Eric Deetjen, Luke Nappa, Ben Nautel, Marika Gronros and Cameron Wetzig. \nGSB also had another 10-plus golfers on its team. \nGarrett Hilchey said he coached the St. George squad to continue \"my mission to make golf more of a factor and to make more kids think about golf and try golf in this area. Golf you can play with your grandparents and grandchildren all in one lifetime, which I think is one of the many cool truths about golf that makes it the best sport.\" \nFour of the five league teams played in the final Tuesday, as Medomak Middle School is just starting its program. The Riverhawks will play in matches next year, \"but they have the same problem as St. George and Oceanside where good golfers play on the soccer or football teams,\" said Garrett Hilchey. \"I can think of three or four kids real quick who will end up as top golfers for their schools and they are not on a middle school team this year.\" \nCRMS practices at the Megunticook Golf Club and Goose River Golf Club in Rockport. St. George and Oceanside practice together at RGC. \nThe regular season included three matches, starting at Wawenock in Walpole, then RGC and at Megunticook. All matches started at about 3:30 p.m. and the first three or four groups got in all nine holes, while the rest played until about 5:30 p.m. \n\"The golf courses were great, letting us have all nine holes for three hours,\" coach Hilchey said. \"With seven to nine holes open we could put all 30 kids out and they all got four or five holes in at least with the first few playing fast and playing to get in all nine.\" \nDuring the matches golfers were put out in groups of four and separated by ability. They played their own ball and turned in their own nine-hole score to the coaches. \"In other cases, if there was a player on one team who had a good friend on another team we would let them go out together. We were very flexible and did what was the most fun for each type of player,\" coach Hilchey said. \n\"In my case, I had two kids who have never played golf and the first two matches they played with me and the last two they played in a scramble format with kids from the other teams who were just starting out as well. In fact, that was one of the more surprising and fun things to see this year was how quick they went from never played to hitting great drives or making long par putts in the championship. \n\"Each coach had their own way of keeping track of their players' progress, and again, the first few groups kept track of their scores, but we did not make it real competitive, but more fun. We do have some plans to make it a bit more competitive in some ways next year.\" \nThe group one golfers, who included St. George's Parker Hilchey, Oceanside's Anderson, CRMS' Lemole and GSB's Wall, were the most competitive. In fact, Parker Hilchey was a few over par each match and did not lose this season. \n\"Really, the future looks bright, because there are a lot of good players on each team and you can see them getting better each year and even from week to week,\" said coach Hilchey. \"Put them with the new players and the ones playing other sports now and we will have some very competitive high school teams for a while and my hope is that will catch on with the even younger kids and create a constant flow of good Midcoast golfers.\" \nCoach Hilchey said the longstanding Mid-Coast Junior Golf Association, used for summer play and clinics for youngsters, will publicly convert to the First Tee of Maine, Mid-Coast Chapter, and \"that is also going to be great for junior golf's future in this area.\" A trio of Camden-Rockport golfers, from left, Ezra Lemole, Hunter Longley and Greyson Orne.
