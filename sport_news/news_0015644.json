Andrew Ruff, left, Daniel Freeman and William Diedrich discuss their recent trip to South Carolina. The three Fort Stewart-based soldiers went to Columbia to bring donated supplies to flood victims. They donated more than 3,000 pounds of supplies to an Operation Blessing Hurricane Relief Center.\nBy Dash Coleman When South Carolina got battered by rain early this month, some Fort Stewart soldiers took action.\n“I saw a lot of people in need, and it just hit home,” said Staff Sgt. Daniel Freeman. “It was close to us, and I could actually do something.”\nFreeman started telling fellow 3rd Infantry Division soldiers he wanted to collect donations and supplies to take to Columbia, where rain caused massive flooding. Staff Sgts. Andrew Ruff and William Diederich were eager to help.\nBy the time they showed up at a relief center in a school gym that weekend, they’d gathered more than 3,000 pounds of supplies for victims. It was all on short notice, too.\n“On the Friday before we left, we collected over $500 just in a five-minute speech during a formation,” Freeman said. “It’s soldiers wanting to help out.”\nThey also secured donations from several local businesses, he said.\nThe soldiers wound up packing two trucks and two trailers full of food, clothing, toys and other supplies.\nThe heavy rainfall led to hundreds of road closures, displacement and some deaths. When the soldiers got to Columbia that week, the flooding wasn’t as visible, but they could see the damage it had done.\n“You could tell the water table was up around there,” Ruff said. “The gym was packed full of blankets, water, food, clothes, shoes, toys — just everything that anybody could think of to help out the flood victims and the people who lost everything up there.”\nThe trip was Freeman’s second time helping out in the Columbia area. In 1989, he volunteered after Hurricane Hugo left much of the state damaged. Seeing people come together this month to help their fellow humans, he said, was a good experience.\n“It was very overwhelming emotionally when you look at it all,” he said.\nThe soldiers made the trip on their own time.\n“You constantly see on the news people doing these horrible things, but you don’t really get to see the kindness of people,” Diederich said. “You don’t get to see how much heart others have in order to help people.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821902.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821902.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:03:38.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
