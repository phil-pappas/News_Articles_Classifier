The Scarlet Knights haven't forgotten last season's 45-3 loss in East Lansing, which featured an MSU attempt at a fake field goal in the second half with a 35-0 lead.\nRutgers coach Kyle Flood, who is suspended for a third and final game tonight for contacting a Rutgers professor about a player's academic status, downplayed the fake after the game.\nBut the Newark Star-Ledger reported this week that Flood told his team after the game that MSU would have to answer for it, and Rutgers receiver Janarion Grant told the paper this week of the fake: \"I try not to remember, but I remember that. It was crazy. … They basically showed us up and kind of treated us like we were real sorry, like a sorry team. But that happens. We just have to prove them wrong.\"\nMSU defensive end and New Jersey native Shilique Calhoun had a feeling the Scarlet Knights might point to last season's game in preparing for the opportunity at a program win.\n\"They might look at it differently,\" Calhoun said of the 42-point margin. \"I would assume that would give you a little extra added, to make you want to really punch someone in the mouth. But on their mind-set, I don't know.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nRutgers writer: WR Carroo's return will give huge lift\nThe senior tri-captain has his team's mind-set to consider. The Spartans have been adamant that winning is all that matters after closer-than-expected battles with Western Michigan, Air Force, Central Michigan and Purdue, but they aren't playing like a top-five team capable of domination.\nTonight is a chance to gain some confidence with a convincing win, before a trip next week to Michigan — which might be less of a look-ahead threat considering the way the Spartans are playing.\n\"I think for everything that's been going on with our team right now,\" senior quarterback Connor Cook said, \"with injuries and, you know, obviously we'd like to be playing a little bit better, I think it's kind of hard to look ahead. … We're not looking ahead to Michigan, we're not looking ahead to Indiana, whoever it is. Our main focus right now is Rutgers, and that's 100% honest.\"\nThe Scarlet Knights have not played well, but star receiver Leonte Carroo is back after a simple-assault domestic violence charge was dropped this week. Carroo was suspended two games and brings a school-record 22 career touchdown catches and NFL-level ability to the field.\n\"I felt pretty comfortable out here,\" Carroo told the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press on Thursday of his return to practice. \"Some of my coaches said it looks like I didn't lose a step.\"\nThe Spartans held Carroo to one catch for 6 yards last season, but that was with Trae Waynes tracking him before leaving MSU a year early and going in the first round to the Minnesota Vikings. MSU's secondary is much less settled for this game, especially with senior safety RJ Williamson out after surgery for a torn biceps.\nThe Spartans also haven't announced if starting tackles Jack Conklin (knee) and Kodi Kieler (knee) will be back for an offensive line that has seen countless combinations. Very little has been consistent for MSU, but one thing that has been consistent over several years is the Spartans' ability to demoralize hostile crowds on the road.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMSU happy to have quality, depth at running back\nMSU is 17-3 in Big Ten road games since 2010 and has won 10 straight, the third-longest active streak of conference road wins behind Ohio State and Florida State (both at 13). Coach Mark Dantonio is 23-9 in Big Ten road games and has at least one win in every league stadium other than High Point Solutions Stadium, where he'll get his first chance as MSU's coach tonight.\n\"I just think we try and change things up,\" Dantonio said of the road formula. \"We try and stay fresh and we try to go together. It's not easy going on the road, there's no question about that. We've had tough games, very difficult games. But our senior class has always led. And we bring our emotion with us, and we have to feed ourselves.\"\nAnd the Spartans should probably expect some emotion from the other side as well.\n\"I think we love when people want to spit on us and call us names, that's the best,\" Calhoun said. \"We just have a great time out there getting cursed at and … no, honestly, we have the mind-set of that's when we need to be at our strongest, when we go on the road. Because it's not always gonna be in our favor.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMichigan State at Rutgers: Scouting report, prediction\nCheck out more staff predictions here .
