Rodgers left the game early with an injury as the Bears stormed back to grab an 18-17 victory. According to head coach John Fox, Rodgers sustained a broken right arm during the game, and his first season with the Bears is over. Bears Stun Chiefs, Win 18-17 Thriller He had 14 carries for 41 yards and one reception for 10 yards this season in five games for the Bears. To replace Rodgers on the 53-man roster, the Bears have signed running back Antone Smith. Smith was released by the Atlanta Falcons with an injury settlement earlier this season. He has 286 career rushing yards and four touchdowns. He also racked up 222 receiving yards and three touchdowns during his career with the Falcons.
