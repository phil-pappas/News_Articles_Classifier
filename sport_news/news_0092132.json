The team says he had a meniscal tear repaired. \nThe loss of Keith, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy last season for playoff MVP, is a huge blow for the Stanley Cup champions. They play in one of the NHL's toughest divisions, and every point could make a difference at the end of the year. \nKeith is likely headed for long-term injured reserve, giving the Blackhawks some cap relief. Lubomir Visnovsky, a veteran defenseman who was with the team during training camp, could be brought back, or they could promote someone from the minors.
