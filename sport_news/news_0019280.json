Banks County finished with 305 yards rushing -- part of 515 yards total -- led by 168 yards and four touchdowns on 21 carries from Trevae Cain. Cain also caught a 66-yard touchdown pass. \nZez Steeple also enjoyed a big night for Banks, rushing for 128 yards and a score and catching a 55-yard scoring bomb. Quarterback Griffin Godwin completed 5 of 8 passes for 189 yards. \n\"They are great leaders,\" Parson said of Cain and Steeple. \"We ask a lot of them and they accept that challenge. We've also got guys banged up, but the next guys keeps stepping up.\" \nCain ran rampant in the first half, scoring three touchdowns, while Steeple added one, as the Leopards sprinted in front. \nYet Lumpkin County would not let Banks put the contest away, as quarterback Chandler Woodham and running back Zach Matthews combined to score four touchdowns and make things interesting. Woodham scored just before halftime, while Matthews scored just after the interval. Those touchdowns, combined with a 22-yard field goal from Wesley Wells, helped Lumpkin pull within 35-17. But, once again, Cain responded, his three-yard run making it 41-17 early in the fourth quarter. \n\"Our kids are teenagers, and it's 35-7 and it's hard to get them back jacked up like they were,\" Parson said. \"But they responded when they needed to.\" \nWoodham finished with 210 yards total offense, including 108 yds passing, while Matthews put up 100 yards rushing. \nBanks County travels to Dawson County in a key region contest next week. \nLumpkin County will take a bye before playing Dawson County on Oct. 30. \nSCORING SUMMARY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:28:17.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
