The Oakland Raiders hosted the Denver Broncos on Oct. 11, 2015. ( AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post ) \nOAKLAND, Calif. — Welcome to the Black Hole, the Broncos' favorite place for a Sunday picnic. \nWhile strolling into the stadium to watch Denver beat Oakland 16-10, I met a Raiders fan dressed like a court jester from the dark side. He stood under a tent adorned with a huge inflatable Darth Vader doll and offered a handshake. \n\"I go by the name Jesta Raider,\" said 43-year-old Travis Foster, dressed like a silver-and-black joker in a pack of cards, as he smiled for a photograph with visitors from Denver. \"Raiders fans are considered heinous gang-bangers. But that's not true. We don't hate. We have love for all NFL fans. We love everybody from Denver.\" \nSo can we please debunk what might be the biggest myth in the NFL? \nThe Black Hole might be the least-frightening scariest place on Earth. \nAnd the Broncos own this dump. \nWith a 5-0 record, Denver also owns the AFC West. There's no need to do the math. Circle Oct. 11, 2015, on the calendar as the unofficial day when the Broncos clinched their fifth consecutive division title. \n\"We play every division game like it's for the championship,\" cornerback Chris Harris said. \nThis victory, the eighth straight for Denver against Oakland, wasn't easy. Or pretty. Hey, in the Black Hole, you've got to get a little down and dirty. Or at least dress goth for the party. \nBut want to know the truth? Advertisement \nIf NFL owners let the Raiders bolt to Los Angeles, I'm going to be ticked. Like any great dive bar, the Black Hole is so bad it's good. Yes, the floors might be mysteriously sticky from something that smells like a mix of stale beer and bad intentions, but the unapologetic grit is what makes it great. \nHere's a partial list of places where it's more intimidating to play than Oakland: 1) The Mad Hatter's Tea Cup ride at Disneyland; 2) the party room at Chuck E. Cheese; and 3) Mahjong night at my 83-year-old mom's house. \nDenver quarterback Peyton Manning can now sit in a rocking chair on a porch and watch, so long as Harris returns an interception 74 yards for a game-clinching touchdown in the fourth quarter. Yes, the Broncos' offense has issues. The best spiral caught by Demaryius Thomas was an Oakland onside kick he fielded in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. \n\"We've got to start scoring touchdowns,\" Thomas told teammate Emmanuel Sanders. \nSanders vowed, \"We will.\" \nThis Denver defense, however, is such a force of nature that my early nomination of the league's coach of the year is Wade Phillips. \n\"This is the best defense I've ever played on. In my whole career. Since I was 8 years old,\" said Broncos safety T.J. Ward, explaining the inevitability of his guys in orange crushing the best-laid plans of opposing offenses. \nAbove all, maybe the real reason Denver has forgotten how to lose in Oakland is because they're still duh Raiders, now epic only in the way they invent ways to fail. \n\"Look to me ... I always take all the accountability,\" said losing quarterback Derek Carr, whose pick-six against a blitz only reinforced the idea that the Broncos do indeed exert mind control on hapless foes. \nBroncomaniacs always ask if it's dangerous to travel to a game in Oakland. \nHeck, no. Mardi Gras — or an Easter egg hunt — is way more dangerous. The Broncos always leave the Black Hole happy, often with people in the stands cheering them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:25:58.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
