They understood how Babcock wanted them to play and when the puck dropped for real, invariably they were ready.\nThe older and more established players on the Leafs roster are afforded no such luxury, however. A reality that is readily apparent the deeper we move into training camp.\nWith the opener of the regular season just five days away, Babcock once again rolled out a new set of forward lines and defensive combinations on Thursday as he searches for something that works. That, we surmise, will be a season-long exercise.\n“Normally, when you’ve been nine or 10 years in one spot, you’re not worried about (veterans),” Babcock said following two practice sessions Thursday at the MasterCard Centre in Etobicoke. “But when you come to a new place, you don’t know who they are. They’ve got to get going. So that’s up to them and up to me.”\nPerhaps no player has seen it more than centre Tyler Bozak. With his long-time winger, Phil Kessel, gone, Bozak has had a variety of wingers during camp as Babcock tinkers with a tenuous top six forward group.\n“I think (the coaching staff) are trying to find a combination that works,” Bozak said on Thursday. “We haven’t played that well yet. It’s just moving guys in and out of different spots and seeing where they can find the best chemistry and the three guys that work together.\n“We’ve got two more pre-season games (Friday in Detroit, Saturday at home to the Wings) so we’ve got two more chances to get better before the regular season.”\nOn Thursday, Bozak was between Joffrey Lupul and Shawn Matthias (with some rushes including Michael Grabner) while Nazem Kadri centred James van Riemsdyk and Daniel Winnik.\nAnd how about the blue line presentation? Captain Dion Phaneuf was with Stephane Robidas while Morgan Rielly was paired with Roman Polak and Jake Gardiner alongside Scott Harrington.\nBabcock said he wasn’t questioning the effort of players, which speaks to the depth of the challenge he is facing in season one of an eight-year deal.\n“There isn’t one guy here who is not trying,” Babcock said. “But under the pressure, under the gun, they’ve always gone back to who they are. Who you are has to (have) winning habits. It’s got to be over and over and over again. I spend half my time explaining the drill instead of teaching. Once they ‘get’ where to go, then we can teach them more.\n“I spend half my time explaining the drill instead of teaching.”\nWhere to go and how to get there has been a work in progress, as you would expect it to be. Babcock’s system and structure demands aren’t necessarily difficult and complicated, but it has been delivered rapid-fired during practices and with high expectations.\n“You have to be ready in the morning for practice or you are going to stick out like a sore thumb,” Bozak said. “It’s a lot of information, a different style than we’ve played here. Obviously, as we have seen, it does work when everybody’s on the same page.\n“When you play a certain style that is prone to winning, as he has shown, it’s obviously going to take some time to learn and master. But I think when we get it down, we’re going to be a lot better team.”\nIf Babcock has sympathy to the learning curve, it is only to a point. What bothers him most about the struggles over the past two pre-season games — in which the Leafs have been shut out — is sloppiness that has nothing to do with structure.\n“You can’t play if you’re going to turn pucks over,” Babcock said. “It’s a hard, heavy game in the National Hockey League and if you play right, you have a chance to have success. If your shifts are 10 miles long, you’re not going to have any success because the other team’s fresh and you’re worn out.\n“You’ve got too play 40 seconds or less and you’ve got to play hard.”\nJAYS TAKING PRESSURE OFF LEAFS\nHe may be a new resident of Toronto, but Leafs coach Mike Babcock has caught a strain of Blue Jays fever.\nIt may not be for the reasons that you think, however.\nWhen he coached in Detroit and the Tigers went on a run, he saw less attention played to his Red Wings. While it’s tough to slip under the radar in Toronto, Babcock figures that if the Jays take a little heat off his team early in the season, it won’t be a bad thing.\n“I want (the Jays) on a long run so that we can get playing good before people start watching us,” Babcock said. “Obviously it’s exciting. I was in Detroit when (the Tigers) had great runs in the playoffs. All that does is keep the heat off the Red Wings.”\nWhile there is less attention on the Leafs this fall than in any recent training camp, that may be wishful thinking for Babcock. Many eyes will be on the new coach next week in what will be a wild week for Toronto sports fans with Jays home games Thursday and Friday and Leafs home contests Wednesday and Saturday.\nNHL\nMike Babcock paying close attention to Leafs veterans\nBy Rob Longley , Toronto Sun First posted: Thursday, October 01, 2015 08:04 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 01, 2015 08:17 PM EDT\nMike Babcock acknowledged on Thursday that in his days with the always playoff-bound Detroit Red Wings, he often didn’t pay much attention to veteran players during training camp.\nFor those players, there was minimal need.
