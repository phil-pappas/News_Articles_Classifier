Shahadat Hossain \nThe court had then sent him to jail. The next day, police pleaded for a seven-day remand. \nOn Thursday, the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Yousuf Hossain rejected Shahadat's bail plea and granted the law enforcers three days for interrogating him. \nIn September, the cricketer filed a police complaint claiming that his housemaid had gone missing. \nBut several hours later, the 11-year-old girl surfaced to accuse the cricketer and his wife of regular torture. \nPolice said one Khandkar Mozzamel Haque found the girl at Mirpur and took her to the local police. \nHaque later filed the case. \nHossain last played for Bangladesh in May against Pakistan. He went off the field on the first day of the first Test with a leg injury. \nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) got him treated in Australia and he was now undergoing a rehabilitation programme. \nThe BCB earlier said the reports of torturing a minor were 'utterly embarrassing' and banned the pacer from all forms of cricket until the charges were settled. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:18:11.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
