Sequoyah coach James Teter knows the winning has to start Friday when the Chiefs make the visit to Cass.“This is where we were last year, so they understand the situation, but there is a sense of urgency,” Teter said. “There really has been every game for us, so we can get caught up, get going and get on a roll. The urgency is high here, because we need to get some wins to stay in the race.”To start picking up wins, Sequoyah will need to start scoring some points. Outside of its 41-10 win over River Ridge, the Chiefs have struggled to pick up their new offense, scoring a total of only 17 points over their other four games.Sequoyah is coming off its second bye week, which Teter said was used more to get healthy and fine-tune the offense, rather than add anything new. “For us, it’s just trying to get better at what we do,” he said. “We’ve been making a lot of mistakes lately on offense, so we went back to square one and started over. We’ve been reteaching some things to try to get the kids to limit those. We tried to shore up some holes we saw.”For the Chiefs to find success against a Cass defense that has given up just over 16 points per game since its opener, they need to avoid being one-dimensional on offense. Teter believes that can happen, but it will come down to execution.“We’re not going to change a lot of things,” he said. “We’re just going to do the best we can. We’re going to keep doing what we’re doing and get better at the offense. We’ll do our normal thing — run the ball in there, try and find some holes and try to loosen them up. Once we do that, hopefully, we’ll find some room to throw the ball.”Running backs Cameron Gales, Luke Jensen and Trey Mitchell have split carries for the Chiefs this season, and at least one will need to find success to open up some space for Austin Tracy and Colorado-bound receiver Derrion Rakestraw. However, none of that can happen without a strong performance from the offensive line.“For us, every week comes down to our offensive line,” Teter said. “If they can block and open some holes for us and we can move the ball, we’re a pretty good team. The games that we’ve found success has come down to whether or not they have been able to open those holes for us. If we can get that going we should be alright.”Defensively, the Chiefs will be tasked with stopping a strong running game. Cass utilizes a stable of running backs, including Laizon West, Trevor Lowe and Terry Birden, and all are likely to get carries.Luckily for Sequoyah, its linebacking corps has been one of its strongest units all season, and the trio of Greyson Van Dyke, Mac Wells and Daniel Bennett will need to continue to play well to get the Chiefs back on track.
