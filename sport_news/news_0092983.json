Detectives arrested William M. Ingram, 28, on Tuesday at a hotel in Palatine, according to Elgin Police Cmdr. Ana Lalley. Ingram, of the 0-100 block of Poplar Creek Drive, is set to appear in Kane County bond court at 8 a.m. Saturday. Turner was found shot around 9 p.m. April 30 in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant near Fleetwood Drive and McLean Boulevard, police said. He was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead about three hours later. Turner's mother, Dorothy Turner of Aurora, said she was shocked by Ingram's arrest -- he had dated her daughter and was friends with her children. \"He called me mom,\" she said. \"Ate at my house. I never in a million years thought it would be someone I knew.\" Dorothy Turner said she has known Ingram for more than four years. Even during the murder investigation, she said, Ingram reached out to her other children and even \"befriended me on Facebook to read my pain and hurt.\" Devonte Turner was an outgoing young man who liked to make people laugh, his relatives and friends said at a recent vigil. \"He was a loving, caring person. Playful; very respectful,\" Dorothy Turner said. \"He loved his nieces. He was a family person.\" Lalley said detectives found evidence that led them to Ingram but didn't release additional information.
