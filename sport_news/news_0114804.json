(Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) Ahead of their matchup against the Oakland Raiders Sunday, the San Diego Chargers are making some changes to their roster. The team signed safety Adrian Phillips to the active roster Tuesday and brought on defensive lineman Chuka Ndulue for the practice squad. Phillips, standing 5-foot-11-inches and weighing 210 pounds, has appeared in three games after he started this season on the practice squad. He registered six tackles with one tackle for loss, the Chargers say. On Oct. 12, he was waved to make room for tight-end Antonio Gates before Week 5, when he was signed back to the practice squad. Ndulue most recently played with the Denver Broncos. Standing 6-foot-3-inches and weighing 289 pounds, he signed with Denver as an undrafted rookie free agent out of Oklahoma. There, he had appeared in 45 games, totaled 140 tackles, 17 tackles for loss and 12 sacks. During the preseason with the Broncos, he played all defensive line positions and registered half a sack. He was released from Denver's practice squad on Sept. 22.
