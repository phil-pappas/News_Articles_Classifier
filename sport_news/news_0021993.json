There’s a good chance the archaic morning skate eventually goes the way of the dodo.\n\"Not opposed,\" veteran Rangers defenseman Marc Staal said on Monday.\nRangers coach Alain Vigneault hasn’t announced the formal cessation of full team morning skates. But Avalanche coach Patrick Roy did for his team last week, except for game days after the team did not practice the day before.\nOnce, morning skates could be used to round players back into playing shape for that day after, ahem, perhaps a late night out. But, nowadays, these hockey professionals are so attuned to fine-tuning their bodies that it’s no longer an issue.\nFor the uninitiated, in a typical full team morning skate, that night’s lines and defense pairs will take some rushes, some power-play work will be done with a couple of other drills thrown in to get the legs moving. The whole thing usually takes 25 minutes, maximum.\nBut it also means the players are putting on and taking off their equipment twice. And getting hockey equipment on is much more complicated than just pulling up a pair of pants and slipping a jersey over the head. There’s a whole art just to the process of taping the skates, or around the socks, let alone working on their sticks.\n\"Over the course of 82 games and playoffs, having not to put that on and practice another 82 times is beneficial to the body,\" Staal said.\nOf course, Staal noted the morning skate experience is \"personal for everyone.\" Certainly players, for instance, the recently retired Marty St. Louis, wanted to be on the ice as much as possible.\nThe Devils, under first-year NHL coach John Hynes, have shown no inclination to phase out morning skates.\n\"I think every team has their philosophy on that,\" said Vigneault, who continued on to explain his.\n\"I believe, in today’s game, if you have one skate today, then you don’t need to skate tomorrow,\" Vigneault said. \"If we didn’t skate today, I’d skate in the morning. But with the amount of games that teams have to play, in my estimation, you’ve got to pick your spots on the ice.\"\nBesides, Vigneault believes that morning preparation time can be spent more effectively in other ways.\nThere is off-ice conditioning work that can be done either at the team’s hotel on the road or at Madison Square Garden. Video work as well, either in team meetings or individual sessions.\nVigneault admitted some of the veterans gave him some \"friction\" last season when he started significantly reducing the number of full morning skates.\nUltimately, though, Vigneault said the players got used to it.\n\"Since I’m in charge, I get to decide,\" added Vigneault, laughing.\nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:53.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
