He was named NFC defensive player of the week after a Week 2 victory over Philadelphia in which he was in on 14 tackles and intercepted a pass. His last tackle on Sunday night came when he helped bring down tight end Ben Watson on the Dallas 3 late in the first quarter. \nDunbar, a New Orleans native, appeared to have twisted his knee returning the kickoff to open the second half. \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
