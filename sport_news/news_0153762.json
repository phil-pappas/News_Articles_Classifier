PJ Ward-Brown/The Courier-Tribune By Dennis Garcia dgarcia@courier-tribune.com Twitter: @DennisGarciaCT \nASHEBORO — It all started in kindergarten when Sawyer Davidson received a flyer from the school about wrestling. It was a sport, he said, that interested him even at a very young age. \nWith his dad, who wrestled in high school, encouraging him to pursue the sport, Davidson began to excel. Excel so much, in fact, he earned a scholarship to wrestle for the University of North Carolina. \nAsheboro High School’s Davidson verbally committed to UNC recently, choosing the Tar Heels over N.C. State and Appalachian State. The defending North Carolina state champion at 145 pounds said it was a tough decision, but a decision he is happy he made. \n“It was a really tough choice,” said Davidson, who is a combined 132-8 during his first three years in high school. “I took an official visit a couple of weekends ago and kinda fell in love. They are starting to build a program and I wanted to be a part of it. When I went up there, I felt like was already a part of the family and a part of the team.” \nThe Tar Heels are under the direction of new head coach Coleman Scott. Scott came to UNC as an assistant in 2014 and has served as the interim head coach since June. Scott was a four-time All-America performer at Oklahoma State and the 2008 NCAA champion at 133 pounds. In addition to his success at the collegiate level, Scott has also excelled at the international level as a four-time member of the United States National Team. His crowning achievement came at the 2012 London Olympics, where he won a bronze medal in freestyle wrestling at 60 kg. \n“Carolina is a program that is really going to move up and I want to be a part of that,” said Davidson, who finished second in the state as a freshman, third as a sophomore and first last season. \nUNC was 11-6 in dual meet competition, including a 2-3 mark in the ACC. \n“His dedication and drive, his work ethic is what makes him so impressive,” AHS wrestling coach Wes Berrier said of his senior. “He has a chance to be a four-time state qualifier and a two-time state champion. Twice he’s been named All-American and he’s ranked in the top 25 in the nation according to the FLO rankings. There aren’t many people around here with that type of resume. He is going to rise to whatever level is around him. And he hasn’t even reached his full potential yet.” \nDavidson said he will work toward a degree in business while at UNC. \nThough his college decision has been made, there’s still plenty of work to do to prepare for his senior season at AHS. Competing with the Arrichion Wrestling Club out of Greensboro, Charlotte and Raleigh, Davidson is currently training for the Super 32 wrestling tournament, which will take place Halloween weekend in Greensboro. \n“I have been practicing three or four days a week and I’m not going to stop training this hard because I made this decision,” Davidson said. \nBerrier said making his decision at this time should benefit him for his final year at AHS. \n“Can you imagine the pressure that is off of him right now?” Berrier said. “To have that behind him and to be able to look at what is in front of him. Now he can go out and enjoy this season.” \nDavidson said he has plenty of work to do if he hopes to make a mark at UNC. \n“They have a couple of real hammers up there at 149 and 157,” Davidson said. “Conditioning is going to be big for me and intensity level. When you get to that level, everyone has the technique. It’s really about conditioning and who wants it more.” \nThat should put Davidson in a favorable position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:58:37.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
