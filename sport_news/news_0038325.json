But to say the referee was 'weak and naive', referring to one of the top referees, not just in this country, also in Europe, to call him 'weak and naive' we can do. \n\"Afraid costs £50,000. Weak and naive - you can use. \n\"For football in this country, what is more important is a word rather than aggression. So now we know. They are the only two good things I take from that. It’s good for everyone. It’s that’s the only reason I can still walk in London without an electronic tag.\" \nIn another not so thinly-veiled broadside at Wenger, Mourinho added: \"We can push people in the technical area.\" \n\"There is something that, now, we know. One, we can push people in the technical area. We can, no problem.\" \nMourinho appeared to be referencing an altercation between Mourinho and Wenger in October 2014 when Wenger pushed Mourinho but received no sanction from the FA. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
