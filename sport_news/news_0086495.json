A few tips & tricks from make up artist Saloni Arora\nManpriya Singh\nEver since the first hair cut by Adhuna Akhtar happened, NIFT degree became redundant. Make up and hair it was for Saloni Arora. The bolder, the experimental, the better! “I got fascinated,” shares the 28-year-old, originally from Amritsar, based out of Delhi and currently visiting Chandigarh for work. Make-up is literally going places. “We have two virtual studios in Delhi and Mumbai, with a total of 60 artists who are open to travelling around the country for destination weddings,” she adds, of her creative brainchild Makeup Mafia. “In 3 hours we do as many as 40 to 48 make-ups which is for catering green rooms, catwalk shows and fashion campaigns,” she shares, greatly inspired by American body art painter Craig Tracy and hoping to work someday on Lady Gaga. ‘I also like Bipasha Basu for her colour.”\nLadies, listen!\nI think one part where a lot of women go wrong is in blending the eye shadow. The different colours should be made to look like a part of a coherent one. Second thing where most Indian women go wrong is in applying kohl. It is the most used and women often think that kohl will automatically make their eyes look bigger, whereas it defines the eyes. Instead a white or a beige line along the waterline of your lower lash can really open up your eyes. Some make-up\nBB creams are wonderful and should be resorted to much more often. They are great for first coverage, for beginners and even for men. A good BB cream looks just like your skin, only better, while taking care of daily moisturisation and sunscreen needs. Trend alert\nSmokey eyes are always in. Then this season is all about lots of lashes and nude lips. The focus is on eyes. While the previous few seasons may have led everyone to colour their pouts in flaming reds, oranges and corals, the nudes have really taken over. Even for brides, a lot of them are sporting nude lips during their cocktail and engagement. manpriya@tribunemail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:04:43.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
