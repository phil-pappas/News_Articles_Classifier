Spiller with a short pass that the running back turned into an 80-yard touchdown - the 400th of the Saints quarterback's career - on the second play of overtime and New Orleans won for the first time this season, 26-20 over the injury-decimated Cowboys on Monday night. ''We had to really earn it on both sides of the ball, all the way around,'' Brees said. Brees, who missed New Orleans' previous game because of a bruised rotator cuff in his right (throwing) shoulder, completed 33 of 41 throws for 359 yards and two TDs in his return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:31:14.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
