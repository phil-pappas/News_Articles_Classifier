The fight between the two could determine who gets the next title shot and the winner of Carlos Condit-Robbie Lawler at UFC 195 in January.\nIt'll mark the second time he's fought since losing the title to Lawler at UFC 181 in 2014. Hendricks had trouble cutting weight before that fight, and even thought about retiring from the sport all together. He bounced back with a win at UFC 185 in Dallas in March partially because he changed how he cut weight before the bout with Matt Brown.\nNow Hendricks says he's feeling as good as ever heading into his matchup with Woodley.\n\"I'm in a lot better place now. I'm bigger than I have been in a long time,\" he said. \"I've been really focusing on trying to get my body fat; I don't want to be shredded. Fifteen percent. If I can beat fifteen percent that's all I'm asking for.\"\nHendricks said the loss to Lawler was one of the best things that has happened to him in his UFC career.\n\"Now it can further my career instead of me walking away,\" he said. \"I might have had one fight left in me. If I win that fight [against Robbie Lawler], I don't change my diet. We probably don't change everything that we are doing. The next fight, the same thing happens and I'm probably like, 'Dude. Screw it. I'm done. I don't want to cut weight like that.' That's where I was at after that fight. It was 50-50. Fifty percent that I was going to quit and retire or fifty percent that I was going to continue to do it. We ended up sticking with it.\"\nTo read more on the drastic weight-cutting methods used in the UFC, click here .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-09-30T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:21:17.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
