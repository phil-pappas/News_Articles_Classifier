We need to defend better,\" said Mourinho. \"We need our midfielders to be just worried in the central area of the pitch, not worrying about compensation on the left or right. Playing with Willian and Pedro, the midfielders don't have to move left or right. They know those parts are controlled.\n\"Pedro and Willian did amazing work and allowed the midfielders to be very comfortable. It was a tactical decision. Leaving super quality on the bench, but bringing tactical discipline and hoping the team could be solid. Today I made this decision. I have other possibilities. I have to try and make the best decision for the team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:11:57.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
