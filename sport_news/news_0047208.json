The Scouting the Game contest will take place on 5th Street though the contest is to be decided. \nRB David Walker Cheyenne12 car 171 yards 14.2 avg 4 tdsLast week the Desert Shields put their athletes to work with a great performance from Walker who has paced an outstanding senior year. With 772 yards and 10 scores through 6 games, Walker has keyed a huge rebound season with the performance versus Pahrump Valley allowing the team to control its own destiny over the final weeks of the season in playoff seeding. \nILB Cruz Littlefield Las Vegas12 tackles 1 pdAfter a week 1 loss to Green Valley, Las Vegas is on a four game win streak and the blanking of Coronado is a statement game for a team looking to regain the Wildcat magic. Littlefield is the heart of the Wildcat defense and his 12 tackle performance is a continuation of the impact he brings week-in and week-out. \nD1 Top 10 \n10. Spring Creek 5-1 \nLiberty (4-1) at Canyon Springs (2-3) Last season, these two programs opened league play in the Northeast League with the Pioneers defense holding strong to shut out the Patriots offense as the won 15-0 on the road.With a shuffled coaching staff and a heavy loss of talent, the Pioneers are in need of finding their offensive identity while the defense has given up at least 30-points in the last three games. Sitting at 2-3, the Pioneers are a speedy team but they are in need of stars to emerge.For the Patriots, they have been the team to beat in the Sunrise since 2010 and this season they have arguably the most balanced team they have featured in that time frame. The duo of Ethan Dedeaux have keyed a 4-1 start with a eye opening 76-53 win over Mililani (HI). Poised for another state playoff run, the Patriots are one of the top team on the west coast that should be ranked nationally. With the Patriots seeking revenge, the Pioneers will need their team to step it up to avoid a similar game to the Bishop Gorman at Shadow Ridge matchup that was over by the end of the first quarter. \nCheyenne (4-2) at Mojave (4-2) A game with major playoff implications, Cheyenne and Mojave are tied for second place in the Sunset 1A with the Desert Shields looking like one of the most dangerous teams in the league with their ability on both sides of the ball. The Cheyenne defense has continued to improve each week and they have several guys on offense that can carry the load highlighted by running back David Walker.Mojave sits at a gritty 4-2 on the season as they haven't seen a true offensive weapon emerge but they feature a tough that hasn't allowed more than one score in each of their wins. Both programs feature impressive athletes that will make this a very interesting game to watch. \nBasic (4-1) at Green Valley (2-3) (Henderson Bowl) The best matchup of the week and a tremendous rivalry game, the Basic Wolves bounced back from their first loss to take down a very competitive Silverado team 35-21 last week. Their offense had their most efficient performance of the year and will look to match that effort versus the Gators.The Gator have had a tough early schedule alternating big wins with tough losses and are fresh off of a 51-17 runaway loss to Liberty. The lack of consistency has been a troubling problem for the team but they have plenty of weapons that are capable of a playoff surge. \nOther games to watch \nSpanish Springs (2-3) at McQueen (3-2)Neither program looks like a major contenders to take down Reed but the winner of this contest will control their own destiny for the second seed in the playoffs. \nMoapa Valley (4-2) at Virgin Valley (3-3) A major rivalry game, Moapa Valley can nearly lock in a spot in the playoff with a win tonight the Bulldogs would love to take down the Pirates while putting themselves in the driver's seat for a playoff run as well \nSpring Valley (4-2) at Pahrump Valley (3-3) Tied a 2-2 for the #4 spot in the 1A Sunset, Pahrump Valley has been a better team than expected with Spring Valley traveling the long road in need of a win. \nSpring Creek (5-1) at Truckee (3-3) After three straight losing seasons, Spring Creek has surged this year grabbing a huge win over Fernley last week that leaves them tied for the #1 seed in the Northern 1A.Truckee has struggled since winning a four straight state titles from 2009-12 but they are showing signs of life and are in need of a program victory with Spring Creek visiting, FEATURED PRODUCT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:20:34.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
