Some teams are in position to win their region, or at least clinch a postseason spot, while others still have work to do.Despite suffering its first loss of the season by a lopsided margin at Roswell, Walton is still very much in the hunt in Region 5 . North Cobb, meanwhile, has won two straight and leads Region 4 ahead of a big test at McEachern.Allatoona is still in good shape to defend its Region 5 title after winning five straight, but its season-opening loss to East Paulding could still come back to hurt. The Buccaneers are one of four teams — East Paulding included — that have one region loss. Kell and Sprayberry have a loss in Region 7 (B), which means neither has room for error, even when they face one another at Sprayberry on Oct. 30.Walton (5-1, 3-1) is a much-improved team from its three-win season a year ago, and it was cruising right along until Roswell exposed the Raiders 48-14 on Friday. The Hornets were near-flawless on offense while holding the Raiders to minus-18 rushing yards on the strength of eight sacks.“All teams have deficiencies, and (Roswell) hacked our weak spot here and there, but it helps us,” Walton coach Mo Dixon said. “When you’re 5-0 and you’re going through film, you can point this out and point that out, but when you get manhandled, there are a lot of things we can talk about.”Walton has a favorable schedule coming up against Pope, Woodstock and Milton before ending the regular season at home against Cherokee on Nov. 6.North Cobb (3-3, 2-0) scheduled a challenging non-region slate in hopes of excelling once region play began. The season didn’t start in the Warriors’ favor, blowing fourth-quarter leads to Northside-Warner Robins and North Gwinnett, but once region play began, North Cobb edged out wins over Harrison and Hillgrove.The Warriors will need to stay disciplined next Friday for a chance of upsetting sixth-ranked McEachern on the road. “It’s proven that with the tough schedule we play, we knew we would be put in these situations,” North Cobb coach Shane Queen said.North Cobb and McEachern are both unbeaten in Region 4 play, although the Indians are only one game into their slate with a 20-7 win over Marietta. Hillgrove, North Paulding and Harrison are all still threatening with one loss.Allatoona (5-1, 4-1) is on a five-game winning streak with wins over Alexander and South Paulding, and the most difficult portion of the Region 5 schedule is behind the Buccaneers.Sprayberry was on a four-game winning streak before costly turnovers against Riverwood resulted in a 17-6 loss Friday. Now, the Yellow Jackets will have to rebound at Cambridge, which beat Kell 21-7 two weeks ago.Although Kell rebounded from its loss with a 35-6 win over North Springs, the Longhorns will still have to play Riverwood on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:45:05.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
