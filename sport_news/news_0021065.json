The green is blocked from view from the tee by a clump of pine trees.\nFour-times major champion McIlroy returned to action just two months ago after missing the British Open with a ruptured left ankle ligament he suffered playing soccer.\nMcIlroy shot 71 and was out of contention on six-under 210 at the Silverado Resort in Napa in the opening event of the 2015-16 PGA Tour season.\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Larry Fine )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:12:12.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
