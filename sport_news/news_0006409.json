Baylor received all 111 first place votes, TCU was second in every ballot and Texas A&M was third on all ballots as well. The closest any team had come to getting all 11 first place votes was TCU. The Horned Frogs received nine of 11 votes two times this season.\nHouston is also making a move up the polls. The Cougars finished just one point behind Texas Tech after finishing nine points out a week ago.\nHere's a look at this week's Best in Texas poll, which is voted on by the Dallas Morning News' college insiders and bloggers, as well as Denton Record-Chronicle's Brett Vito. Make sure to click here to view the full breakdown .\n1). Baylor, 132 points (11 first-place votes) Baylor Bears (6-0, 3-0) / Beat West Virginia 62-38 / Next: vs. Iowa State, 11:30 a.m. Saturday in Waco\nNo. 2 Baylor finally got a chance to play against a top-20 defense and wiped the floor with the Mountaineers. The Bears dropped 62 points and pulled their starters in the fourth quarter to all but avenge their lone loss from last season. After the performance, Baylor has moved right behind No. 1 Ohio State in the AP poll. After this week's game against Iowa State, Baylor will have an opportunity to pick up some statement wins against the Big 12's best. -- Shehan Jeyarajah\n2. TCU, 121 points TCU Horned Frogs (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) / Last: Beat Iowa State, 45-21 / Next: Bye.\nTCU withstood an early Iowa State barrage to secure its first double-digit road win of the season. Now, the Horned Frogs get a much-needed bye week to rest. Their next game is scheduled for Oct. 29 (a Thursday) against West Virginia in Fort Worth. Quarterback Trevone Boykin pieced together a season-best performance as a passer Saturday, completing 84.4 percent of his attempts for 436 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. Freshman wide receiver/kick returner KaVontae Turpin, the biggest breakaway threat for Boykin, was knocked out of the game during the first quarter with an apparent upper-body injury . Afterward, head coach Gary Patterson had this to offer on Turpin: \"As much as I can tell you, he'll be back. I don't think it's a season-ending (injury), but he took a pretty good hit.\" With Kolby Listenbee firmly back in the mix after a nice showing, a TCU offense stocked with Boykin, Josh Doctson, Listenbee and a healthy, experienced Turpin should provide a myriad of problems for opposing defenses. TCU's defense was lit up during a 21-point first quarter for the Cyclones, and then pitched a shutout the rest of the way. Regardless, the pass defense has looked rather vulnerable through seven games, which could be troublesome with games against Oklahoma State, Oklahoma and Baylor remaining on the schedule. -- Jose Rodriguez\n3. Texas A&M, 110 points Texas A&M Aggies (5-1, 2-1 SEC) / Lost to No. 10 Alabama, 41-23 / Next: at Ole Miss, 6 p.m. Saturday at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium at Hollingsworth Field in Oxford, Miss.\nAlabama running back Derrick Henry rushed for two scores while A&M QB Kyle Allen's three interceptions led to three more touchdowns via pick six by the Tide's defense. The Aggies adjusted well in the second half defensively but were unable to overcome struggles from the quarterback position. Still in contention for the SEC West crown, A&M travels to Oxford to take on Ole Miss in a crucial conference matchup. -- Brandon Wheeland\n4. Texas Tech, 92 points Texas Tech Red Raiders (5-2, 2-2 Big 12) / Defeated Kansas, 30-20 / Next: at No. 17 Oklahoma, 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Norman, Okla.\nThe Red Raiders rediscovered their high-octane offense in last week's 66-31 win against Iowa State but Texas Tech's inconsistencies returned to the forefront in its 30-20 win over Kansas on Saturday. For the first time this season, the third-best scoring offense in FBS was unable score a touchdown in the opening quarter. Head coach Kliff Kingsbury took sole responsibility of the team's stale performance against the Jayhawks and even went as far as to question the maturity of his team. \"I did a terrible job getting [the team] ready this week,\" Kingsbury said after Saturday's win. \"I thought we were at a point, offensively, where we weren't actually; I thought we had mature players that could get it done and handle it.\" The Red Raiders are back on the road this week for a matchup with the Oklahoma Sooners and their former starting quarterback, junior Baker Mayfield. -- Michael DuPont\n5. Houston, 91 points Houston Cougars (6-0, 3-0 AAC) / Beat Tulane, 42-7 / Next: at UCF, 11 a.m. Saturday\nShould Houston be in the CFP discussion? It might be too early for that. But if the Cougars can run the table and win the AAC championship game then the answer is definitely. And right now, that doesn't seem farfetched in the slightest. Houston once again rolled over a conference foe -- this time a 42-7 thumping of Tulane. The Cougars dominated in all three phases of the game to move to 6-0. It wouldn't be surprising to see Houston move up at least a few spots in the next AP Poll. -- E.J. Holland\n6. Texas, 81 points Texas Longhorns (2-4, 1-2 Big 12) /Last: Bye / Next: vs. Kansas State at 11 a.m. Saturday in Austin\nThe Longhorns had an opportunity to rest and regroup during their bye week after a much-needed win over Oklahoma. Texas begins its second half of the season against Kansas State on Saturday. The Longhorns need to win four out of their last six games to become bowl eligible. The Wildcats are coming off a 55-0 loss to the Sooners but always seem to give Texas trouble. -- Nick Castillo\n7. Rice, 64 points Rice Owls (3-3, 2-1 Conference USA) / Last: Bye / Next: vs. Army, 11 a.m. Saturday at Rice Stadium in Houston\nThe Owls had the week off after improving to 2-1 in conference play with a 27-26 win over Florida Atlantic. Next on the schedule for Rice is Army. The Black Knights got their second win off the season last week against Bucknell, 21-14, while holding the Bison scoreless in the second half. This is the last non-conference game for Rice this year. After Saturday, five consecutive C-USA matchups close out the season. -- Brandon Wheeland\n8. SMU, 48 points SMU Mustangs (1-5, 0-2) / Open / Next: at South Florida, 3 p.m. Saturday\nSMU head coach Chad Morris stressed during the bye week that this is process. The Mustangs have flashed some major potential at times this season but have also been their own worst enemy. As Morris put it, SMU needs to stop beating SMU if it wants to keep its bowl hopes alive. After a much-needed bye week, the Mustangs will look to get on the right track against a .500 South Florida team on Saturday. A win is imperative for the Mustangs to recapture some of the momentum they built up early in the season. -- E.J. Holland\n9. UTSA, 45 points UTSA Roadrunners (1-6, 1-2 C-USA) / Lost to Southern Miss, 32-10 / Next: Bye.\nThere weren't any magic formulas for head coach Larry Coker to pass along to his team against Southern Mississippi. The Roadrunners were run off the road by a Golden Eagles attack that amassed 350 yards before halftime and quintupled UTSA's production through the air. Junior running back Jarveon Williams' 88 rushing yards against Southern Miss broke the UTSA single-season rushing record of 570 yards and brought his season total to 618 yards on the ground. The Roadrunners' defense forced four takeaways in the loss, which can serve as a positive takeaway for defensive coordinator Neal Neathery entering their bye week. -- Michael DuPont\n10. UTEP, 36 points UTEP Miners (2-4, 0-2) / Bye / Next: vs. FAU, 6 p.m. Saturday in El Paso\nThe Miners got a merciful week off after losing a combined 77-18 in the first two games of the Conference USA season. UTEP has struggled to find any assemblence of offense the first few weeks of the season. Star running back Aaron Jones went down during the second week of the season, but still leads the team with 209 yards rushing. The Miners might be able to get some momentum against a FAU team that has only one win this season. -- Shehan Jeyarajah\n11. Texas State, 27 points Texas State Bobcats (1-4, 0-1 Sun Belt ) / Last: Bye / Next: vs. South Alabama at 6 p.m. Saturday in San Marcos\nAfter a rough start to its season, Texas State got its second bye week in three weeks. The Bobcats to look to rebound from their 1-4 start when they take on South Alabama. The Jaguars are coming off a bye week of their own and present a challenge for Texas State's struggling defense. -- Nick Castillo\n12. North Texas, 11 points North Texas Mean Green (0-6, 0-3 Conference USA) / Lost to Western Kentucky, 55-28 / Next: at Marshall, 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Huntington, W.Va..\nNorth Texas lost its first game under interim coach Mike Canales on Thursday at home against Western Kentucky and faces a long road the rest of the season. Four of the Mean Green's next five games are on the road, starting at Marshall on Saturday. UNT has lost nine straight on the road dating back to a win over Tulsa in the final regular season game of the 2013 season. Marshall is 6-1, a perfect 3-0 in C-USA play and has won five straight. -- Brett Vito\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/18/best-texas-breakdown-1019-texas-tech-draws-fewer-votes-narrow-win-kansas", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/recap?gameId=400763438"], "published": "2015-10-19T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:04:43.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
