We even have a trusted network of spies — coaches, officials, high school football junkies — who fill us in on what they’ve seen. \nEven with all of that, we practically went down to the wire trying to decide if NV/Old Tappan or Pascack Valley should be our preseason No. 1. It wasn’t quite a coin toss, but our choice did change at least twice coming down the stretch. \nWere we wrong? Well, here we are seven weeks later and both teams are 5-0 and playing some of the best football in North Jersey. \nOf course, we still get emails from North Jersey fans (not all PV backers, mind you) who tell us we made the wrong choice. Well, now we’ll see because the question will be decided in the most fair way possible — on the field Friday night in Hillsdale. \nNo. 1 NV/Old Tappan vs. No. 2 Pascack Valley. Get ready, because this one should be a blast. \nWe’ll do a lot more on this game as the week progresses, but let’s start off with a quick primer on what makes this game so special. \nIt’s OK to be impressed by the NV/OT offense, averaging a staggering 47.4 points per game. And while All-America senior Jordan Fuller is the most talented player, this offense works because he’s not the only threat. \nSenior Kevin Martinez has evolved into a steady quarterback, senior TE Jedh Downey is a big-play player, and running back Zach DeNike doesn’t always get the credit he deserves. The threat of Fuller, wide receiver or Wildcat, casts a long shadow, and that makes everyone better. \nThe Indians counter with an offense that knows how to deliver in the clutch. Senior Colin Dedrick is one of North Jersey’s top quarterbacks, and senior Mike Pimpinella is North Jersey’s best wide receiver at the moment. \nThrow in a running game that’s quite productive despite the lack of a big-name star, and the Indians should give the Golden Knights a good push. \nBoth teams play top-shelf defense. Both are very well-coached and will be well-prepared. This will be the only time they face each other this season, so this game definitely will have a playoff feel. \nBoth could be No. 1. On Friday, one will earn it. \nEmail: czerwinski@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:53:40.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
