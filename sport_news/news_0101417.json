But now the Rockets must battle against mounting pressure to stay there. Today's game vs. UMass (1-5. 0-2) is arguably Toledo's last soft touch before a gauntlet of games against MAC West and East Division teams to close the season.\nIf the Rockets decide to take the game off today, UMass certainly has enough firepower for an upset. If Toledo tailback Kareem Hunt is healthy, this is the game the Rockets can increase his workload for down the stretch.\nIn Division II games today, No. 8 Ashland is at Northern Michigan (4-3). In Division III, Case Western Reserve (5-1) has a home game against Washington & Jefferson (5-1) at 6 p.m. and Baldwin Wallace (4-2) visits Otterbein (4-2) at 1:30.\nAs for the AP Top 25, No. 1 Ohio State, with J.T. Barrett starting at quarterback, plays at Rutgers tonight at 8. No. 2 Baylor hosts Iowa State at noon.
