He’ll be held out of practice on Monday and Tuesday.\nCook was knocked out of the previous game — against Boston College on Sept. 19 — with an upper-body injury, but returned to the game and practiced during FSU's bye week.\n“He’s a guy who heals pretty quickly and plays tough, but you can’t count on that,” Fisher said of Cook during his weekly press conference Monday. “He’s got to wait it day by day and see how it goes.”\nTALLAHASSEE DEMOCRAT\nNo. 9 Seminoles leave Wake Forest with 24-16 victory\nCook was taken out of the game after suffering the hamstring injury in the first quarter. Fisher said the injury was not as bad as initially thought.\nSophomore Johnathan Vickers, who scored his first career rushing touchdown against Wake Forest, and five-star freshman Jacques Patrick will backup Cook.\nVickers, who caught a touchdown pass in the season opener from backup quarterback Sean Maguire, finished the game with 10 carries for 33 yards. Patrick, rated a five-star tailback by several recruiting outlets, only had three carries for 13 yards.\n“I feel good about Vickers and Patrick,” Fisher said. “Those guys are really good.”\nRedshirt junior Mario Pender, who suffered a collapsed lung in practice on Sept. 22 and needed surgery last week, is still in the hospital recovering, but Fisher is “getting good reports back.”\n“He’s getting better and better,” Fisher said of Pender. “Thank God.”\nThe Seminoles also had two other players suffer injuries in the first quarter of the Wake Forest game.\nFisher said junior safety Nate Andrews did not tear his ACL in his left knee, but suffered a “bad bone bruise.” Andrews, who led the team in interceptions during his first two seasons, could miss a couple of weeks.\nRedshirt senior Terrance Smith suffered a right ankle injury that saw some swelling after the game. Fisher did not share a timetable for Smith’s return.\n“They all should be back,” Fisher said. “It’s just a matter of when. I don’t have any idea, and it all depends on each body.”\nVIDEOS: JIMBO FISHER, FSU PLAYERS RECAP WIN AT WAKE FOREST Video: Jimbo Fisher says FSU lacks killer instinct after 24-16 win over Wake Forest | 09:52 Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher speaks after the Seminoles beat Wake Forest 24-16 on Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015.\n1 of 4 VIDEOS: JIMBO FISHER, FSU PLAYERS RECAP WIN AT WAKE FOREST Video: FSU OL Ryan Hoefeld recaps his first start of season against WF | 01:51 Florida State center Ryan Hoefeld speaks after the Seminoles beat Wake Forest 24-16 on Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015.
