So, yes, he responded.\nAfter his team's 40-11 whipping of host Denver North in the Class 2A Colorado League at All-City Stadium on Saturday afternoon, Kent Denver coach Scott Yates talked briefly about his 299th career victory as well as No. 300.\n\"You know what? ... All I want us to do is get ready for the next game,\" he said. \"The other thing will happen when it happens.\"\nHe wasn't crabby, testy or negative. His milestone, he said, will be simply a by-product of his longevity and generations of outstanding Sun Devils.\nNow 6-0 overall, 4-0 in league, Kent Denver, top-ranked in The Associated Press Class 2A poll, next gets Faith Christian at home on Friday at 3 p.m. But don't think the Sun Devils are as modest as their coach â€” they want to win it for him and be a part of it.\n\"You know, Coach Yates is the kind of kind of guy who doesn't want us talking about it or thinking about it,\" senior quarterback and free safety Rob Casey said. \"But it would be quite an honor to get 300 for him.\"\nOn, Saturday, Kent Denver and Yates (299-73) faced the Vikings (2-5, 1-4) without starting backs Will McKissick and Luke Wilson, who sat out with injuries, and they rolled anyway. They managed six interceptions and a fumble recovery and cruised to 511 yards of offense, 336 rushing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:27:58.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
