The multimedia exhibition opened last week at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine. It will run through April 3.\nIt features 30 artists whose works are installed in the cathedral's seven chapels and 14 bays. The exhibit is divided into seven themes: water, soil, seed, farm, market, meal and waste.\nGuest co-curator Robin Kahn says the cathedral's architecture takes visitors in a circle, almost like the food cycle.\nKahn says she hopes the exhibition will empower visitors to \"look at food in a new way that's more beneficial not only to them but to the Earth.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:40:51.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
