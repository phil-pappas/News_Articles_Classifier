It would push south toward Raqqa.\nThe proposed US strategy would also bolster a group of mostly Arab fighters west of the Euphrates to clear out Islamic State along a pocket of terrain along the border with Turkey.\nThe U.S. military, however, declined to provide further details about the groups that received the supplies, their location, or the type of equipment in the airdrop.\n“This airdrop seeks to build on the success those forces have had clearing Isil from Syrian territory,” Ryder said, using an acronym for Islamic State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:53:35.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
