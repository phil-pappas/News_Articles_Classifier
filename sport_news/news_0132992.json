The switch will allow Hunter Industries, which was awarded the $13.7 million project, to begin building an overpass at the intersection.\nThe project, which began in March, is expected to be finalized during the 2016 fall. Once the overpass is completed, Texas 71 traffic at Tahitian Drive will be diverted back onto the main lanes.\nWork crews are assessing and finishing work on new Texas 71 frontage roads at Tahitian Drive. Beginning Sunday night, traffic will be diverted off of the highway and onto the frontage roads to allow for the building of an overpass at the intersection. ANDY SEVILLA/BASTROP ADVERTISER A second overpass is planned for Texas 71 at Texas 95, though officials have not yet provided a construction timeline for that project.\nThe overpasses in Bastrop have long been awaited and much discussed by residents and local leaders. TxDOT officials have said the overpasses are needed for safety and to accommodate growing traffic.\n“The SH 71 corridor from Austin to Houston is a major route that has experienced a large increase in traffic over the past few years. These high traffic volumes, as well as crash history, played a part in moving the project forward to construction,” Kelli Reyna, TxDOT spokesperson, said last year when the state agency announced Hunter Industries as the general contractor for the job.\nThe overpasses in the city will look similar to existing Texas 71 overpasses at Texas 304 and FM 20, TxDOT officials have said.\nIn March, however, Bastrop city council members deliberated placing artwork on the sides of the structures to highlight the city. TxDOT agreed to include artwork on the concrete panels of all four sides of the overpasses if Bastrop paid for the improvements.\nCouncil members unanimously voted to fund the artwork on the roadway, which will depict Bastrop’s signature trees and river, as well as the city’s name and founding year – 1832 – according to the art renderings. The art work is expected to cost $67,875, and the city will cover the cost with Hotel Occupancy Tax dollars.\n“I think sometimes common sense should come into the deliberations process. If you are driving through the community, which would you rather see: a blank panel or a nicely designed panel?” Bastrop City Manager Mike Talbot asked council members before the funding vote in March.\nTxDOT tips to navigate work zones:\n- Slow down and always follow posted work zone speed limits. Speeding is one of the major causes of work zone crashes. Remember, traffic fines double in work zones.\n- Pay attention. Workers and heavy equipment may only be a few feet from passing vehicles.\n- Be patient. Delays from highway construction can be frustrating, but it only takes a few extra minutes to slow down for a work zone.\n- Plan ahead. Leave a few minutes early when traveling through a work zone in order to reach your destination on time.\n- Fines for moving violations in work zones can be as high as $400 if workers are present.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/02/e5/d6/image1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:24:27.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
