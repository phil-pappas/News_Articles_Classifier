She was the 10th person rescued since Saturday.\n“We keep stressing to people you cannot rely on your cell phone in the back country… The cell service is really terrible up there,” says North Shore Rescue Team Leader Mike Danks.\nDanks says people are getting too complacent and aren’t prepared.\n“People think they can just phone 9-1-1 from anywhere they are and help is going to come in a 9-1-1 fashion. We can’t operate that way. People need to be prepared when they’re going out in the back country and they need to be able to take care of themselves. People aren’t doing the research on the hikes that they’re doing and they’re not allowing themselves enough time to get out before dark.”\nHis message has gone out several times, as North Shore Rescue has taken a record number of calls this year: 119 and counting.\n“The frustrating part of these five hikers is that we determined their location and we asked them to stay put and they continued to hike which is a real challenge to us,” says Danks.\nChopper arrives for @NSRescue long line rescue in Lynn Headwaters. pic.twitter.com/WXW7lFPw4N\n— Mike Lloyd (@llikemoyd) October 5, 2015\nLong line rescue now airborne in Lynn Headwaters park. pic.twitter.com/u1GjDax1k6\n— Mike Lloyd (@llikemoyd) October 5, 2015\nCouple reunited after @NSRescue rescues stranded wife. pic.twitter.com/qLvPLtbMD3\n— Mike Lloyd (@llikemoyd) October 5, 2015\nRelated Stories North Shore Rescue team wants help keeping volunteers North Shore Rescue's call for help reaches the BC Legislature North Shore Rescue", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/llikemoyd/status/651052912295084036", "https://twitter.com/NSRescue", "http://t.co/u1GjDax1k6", "http://t.co/qLvPLtbMD3", "http://t.co/WXW7lFPw4N", "https://twitter.com/llikemoyd/status/651042407908175873", "https://twitter.com/llikemoyd/status/651050692929454080"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:29:05.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
