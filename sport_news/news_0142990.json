The childhood delicacy is a staple in millions of lunch boxes all across the country. Pairing nostalgia with deliciousness, the sandwich is something many can resonate with. \nFlorida head coach Jim McElwain has taken this axiom to heart, and prides himself on being a 'PB&J aficionado' of sorts. \nAccording to 247Sports, McElwain has a proclivity for making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The head man took a page out of his mother's book with his sandwich-making skills. \n\"The guys come up to the office and I actually make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches when they're up there,\" said McElwain. \"I teach them to get it right to the edge like my mother used to do. My mom took pride in buttering toast that got all the way to the edge and same thing with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\" \nStaying in the vein of youngster treats, McElwain also has a soft spot for dessert options. \n\"I'm a firm believer in the longer the shelf life, the better it's going to taste. I don't think Uncrustables have shelf life, so that makes a heck of a sandwich. Twinkies, Ding-Dongs, that's sustainable food. I like that.\" \nWe've also found out that stud freshman receiver Antonio Callaway does not like crust on his sandwiches. McElwain obliged by tailoring the food to Callaway's liking. \n\"You focus on making sure that [the peanut butter and jelly] gets all the way to the crust. Then of course I did that and Antonio Callaway doesn't like crust, so I had to cut the crust off. It's a true story.\" \nSurprisingly enough, McElwain didn't divulge whether he liked grape or strawberry jelly better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:37:52.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
