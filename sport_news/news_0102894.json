The crowd boos, because the NFL draft crowd always boos Goodell, but there is a palpable excitement, too.\nThe Chicago Bears have the No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft. Who will they pick to begin the rebuild?\n\"With the first pick in the 2016 NFL Draft,\" says Goodell, \"the Chicago Bears select Paxton Lynch, quarterback, from the University of Memphis.\"\nThe crowd goes nuts.\nLynch walks to the stage, wearing a fresh new suit.\nHey, it could happen. It really could happen. Lynch could be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft.\nI write this in the wake of yet another ridiculous performance by the 6-7 mustachioed one, yet another record-breaking night in a season already packed with them.\nFriday against Tulsa, Lynch completed 32 of 44 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns, and ran in another touchdown from the 3-yard line. It was the guy's fourth career-high passing game of the year.\nSo now seems as good a time as any to ponder the extraordinary opportunities that could be ahead of Lynch if he continues his brilliant play, including a Heisman Trophy and the NFL draft.\nFirst, the Heisman. Lynch isn't going to win the thing. He could lead the team to an undefeated season and he's not winning the Heisman. He could throw for 10,000 yards and 100 touchdowns and he's not winning the Heisman.\nTheoretically, the Heisman Trophy recognizes \"the outstanding college football player whose performance best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity.\"\nIt actually recognizes \"the outstanding college football quarterback (or possibly running back) from a Power Five conference school who may or may not have stolen crab legs or made a killing by selling his autograph.\"\nA player from a non-Power Five Conference can't win the Heisman any longer. It doesn't matter if that player is the best player in the land. He didn't play in a monied conference. End of story. Who said college football is supposed to be fair?\nThe best a player like Lynch can hope for is to make it to the Heisman ceremony in New York. Northern Illinois quarterback Jordan Lynch was invited in 2013. Boise State quarterback Kellen Moore was invited in 2010.\nCould Lynch be invited in 2015?\nSure, if Memphis is undefeated, and if Lynch doesn't have a single less-than-crazy-good game, and if the voters actually watch him play.\nThat's the key to all of this, of course. You have to watch him play. If you watch him, you realize there's no better passer in the country, and you know he belongs in New York.\nOr in Chicago, for that matter, the site of the NFL draft. And before you start with the angry letters, let me say I understand that Lynch is just a junior, and that he could return to play at Memphis his senior year. DeAngelo Williams and Peyton Manning both returned for their senior seasons. They both did OK. So if Lynch wants to come back to Memphis and lead the team for a fourth straight season, put me down for that.\nBut what if Lynch decides he'd rather turn pro after this season? What would be in store for him then? Less than a month ago, I got flak for suggesting Lynch could be a first-round draft pick. Now I think I may have been selling the guy short.\nTwo kinds of players tend to go shooting up the draft rankings: 1) quarterbacks, and 2) players with obvious physical tools. Lynch has both of those things going for him. He's a quarterback with all the physical tools you could possibly want. He's big, strong and mobile. He's got a huge, accurate arm. And unlike Heisman voters, NFL GMs don't give a flip where quarterbacks go to school. Since 2000, NFL teams have spent first-round picks on quarterbacks from Central Florida (Blake Bortles), Delaware (Joe Flacco), Marshall (Chad Pennington and Byron Leftwich), Tulane (J.P. Losman and Patrick Ramsey,) Utah (Alex Smith) and Fresno State (David Carr).\nSmall wonder ESPN's Mel Kiper now has Lynch at No. 10 on his draft board. And if Lynch is No. 10 on the draft board, he could be chosen No. 1. At that point, it just comes down to team needs. No team that needs a quarterback will pass on a guy with franchise potential to take a cornerback or linebacker instead.\nSo Lynch could easily wind up in (here's just a short list) Chicago, Kansas City, San Francisco, Houston, Cleveland, Washington, St. Louis or New Orleans. All those teams need quarterbacks. Kansas City and Chicago were among the five NFL teams that had scouts at the Tulsa game. Pittsburgh sent its GM.\nAnd, yes, all of this is dependent on Lynch continuing to play as well as he has all season. Remember when some projected that Ole Miss quarterback Jevan Snead would go No. 1? Quarterbacks are only as good as their last errant slant or dumb interception. Snead wasn't drafted at all.\nSo here's hoping Lynch continues to focus on the things that require his focus. Here's hoping he continues to take the season one stupendous throw at a time. But if Lynch's next seven games are anywhere near as good as his last six games?\nThere could be a No. 1 jersey in Chicago with his name on it.\nTo reach Geoff Calkins, call 901-529-2364 or email calkins@commercialappeal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:41:21.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
