Rick Brown/HawkCentral.com Iowa running back Jordan Canzeri celebrates as he leaves the field after leading Iowa to a win over Illinois on Saturday. (Photo: Bryon Houlgrave/The Register) \nIOWA CITY, Ia. â€” Jordan Canzeri had a date late Saturday afternoon. With an ice bath. \n\"That will be needed,\" Canzeri said, a you-know-why smile breaking out on his face. \"Sunday, too.\" \nThis, after the senior carried the ball a school-record 43 times for 256 yards in No. 22 Iowa's 29-20 Big Ten victory over Illinois at Kinnick Stadium. \n\"One of the greatest performances from a running back in this stadium,\" said Iowa radio analyst and former star Ed Podolak. \nOnly two Iowa running backs have gained more yards than Canzeri did Saturday. Tavian Banks went for 314 yards against Tulsa in 1997. And Podolak needed just 17 carries to gain 286 yards against Northwestern in 1968. \n\"I would certainly like to see him get some kind of outstanding award for what he did (Saturday),\" Podolak said.
