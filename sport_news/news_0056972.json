On Saturday, fourth-seeded Walton will host No. 5 Harpursville. \nVestal (4-3) and Binghamton (5-2) won't the start the postseason until the following week, but this non-division matchup at 7 p.m. Friday at Binghamton Alumni Stadium figures to be good one. Binghamton's offense, fueled by Devin Young, Rashawn Pettiford and quarterback John Petrucci, has proved it scored on anybody this season, averaging 39 points. \nBut as coach Mike Ramil pointed out after last week's 41-34 home win against Corning, the defense has been suspect at times. The Patriots have allowed four opponents to score 30 points or better. \n\"We're so inconsistent with how we play defense,\" said Ramil, whose team will host Corning in a Class AA semifinal in Week 9. \"We'll play well two or three quarters and then some weird things will happen.\" \nThe Golden Bears are coming off a 34-27 loss to Johnson City, despite 129 rushing yards from quarterback T.J. Wegmann and 103 from Logan Wiland. Vestal will travel to JC next week for a Class A semifinal. \nLast season, Vestal scored a 56-53 victory over the Patriots. \nFRIDAY \nElmira (7-0) at Johnson City (4-3): Non-division tilt could be a good one, with the Express coming off a 49-7 thumping of Horseheads and JC junior Shafeeq Hosea leading the Wildcats over Vestal with 278 rushing yards. \nIthaca (0-7) at Maine-Endwell (7-0): In an odd — unprecedented? — occurrence, the team with the longest skid in the state will face the team the longest streak in the state. The Little Red have lost 31 straight and the Spartans are riding a state-record 58-game streak. \nHorseheads (3-4) at Union-Endicott (1-6): The Blue Raiders earned a 21-18 victory against the Tigers last season. Both teams will look to gain some momentum, with Horseheads facing Elmira and U-E opposing Maine-Endwell the following week in sectional semifinals. \nWaverly (6-1) at Owego (5-2): Two of the better quarterbacks around in Waverly's Peyton Miller and Owego's Logan Neira will square off. An Owego win would send Section 4 officials scurrying for their calculators as the Indians, Waverly and likely Susquehanna Valley would finish league play with 4-2 records. \nNorwich (2-5) at Windsor (3-4): Tag this one Division III's What-If Bowl. Two of Norwich's division losses came by a combined three points. The Black Knights have a pair of five-point losses in division. \nSidney (3-4) at Greene (3-4): Warriors quarterback Darren Smith and Trojans running back Luke Erickson have put up some big numbers this season. Smith, a freshman, threw for 250 yards in Sidney's 35-18 loss to Newark Valley last week. Erickson rushed for 210 yards in a 35-0 victory over Whitney Point. \nOxford (4-3) at Tioga (6-1): The Tigers start the playoffs chasing their fifth straight Class D title. Teams played last week, with Tioga earning a 43-28 victory that included 177 rushing yards from Jesse Manuel and three rushing touchdowns from Adam Zwierlein. Oxford's Xavier Cruz ran for 157 yards and two scores. \nGroton (4-3) at Deposit/Hancock (7-0): Expect plenty of scoring in this sectional quarterfinal as Groton is averaging 36 points to Deposit/Hancock's 40. Running back Ronnie Ballard will no doubt be the focus of Groton defenders. \nBainbridge-Guilford (2-5) at Morrisville-Eaton (1-6): B-G's Austin Carr completed 17 passes last week in a 36-12 loss to Walton. Fourteen went to Zach Ouimet for 155 yards and a touchdown. \nUnatego (2-5) at Frankfort-Schuyler (3-4): The Spartans threw it 47 times in a 28-22, triple-overtime loss to Unadilla Valley. \nSATURDAY \nChenango Valley (5-2) at Chenango Forks (6-1): The Blue Devils received their second forfeit win of the season last week, against Lansing, but as CV coach Jay Hope said, \"I'm sure they'll be ready.\" Two-time defending Class C state champion Forks hasn't lost to CV since a 14-13 setback in 1994. Warriors quarterback Mark Mullins went 14-for-19 for 140 yards in last week's 19-16 loss to Susquehanna Valley. \nHarpursville (6-1) at Walton (6-1): The Warriors came into the last season's playoffs as the top seed but lost to eighth-seeded Seton Catholic Central in the quarterfinals. Dawson Beers rushed for 280 yards in Walton's 36-12 over B-G last week. Harpursville forced five turnovers in its 39-20 win over Thomas A. Edison in Week 7. \nOneonta (0-7) at Susquehanna Valley (4-3): The Sabers, coming off a big 19-16 at CV last week, will look to extend their winning streak to four. The Yellowjackets have dropped 11 straight. \nNewark Valley (6-1) at Whitney Point (0-7): Four Cardinals rushers gained at least 60 yards in last week's 35-18 win at Sidney. The Golden Eagles have lost 10 in a row. \nSeton Catholic Central (0-7) at Spencer-Van Etten (1-6): The Saints have allowed at least 30 points in every game this season. Panthers quarterback Anthony Chuisano completed 25 passes for 347 yards and five touchdowns in a 56-34 loss to Moravia last week. \nDelhi (2-5) at Cooperstown (2-5), 2 p.m.: The Bulldogs will look to end a four-game skid. \nUnadilla Valley (3-4) at Lafayette (3-4), noon: The Storm have won three of their last five. \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob 1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1RYP8Mt TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:21:20.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
