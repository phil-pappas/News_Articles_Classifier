The Wolverines weren't even considered Big Ten Conference contenders when the season began unranked but now are rated 12th by the media and 14th by the coaches.\nMore will be known whether Michigan is indeed the real deal when Michigan State (No. 7 by the media and No. 4 by the coaches) visits \"The Big House\" on Saturday. The Wolverines' other major test also is at home, Nov. 28 against defending national champion Ohio State.\nAROUND THE NATION — Florida's chances of a Southeastern Conference or even national title took a significant hit Monday when quarterback Will Grier was suspended for the season after testing positive for a drug on the NCAA's banned list. \"I took an over-the-counter supplement that had something in it, and I did not check with the medical staff before taking it,\" he said. \"I really hope that people can learn from this, learn from my mistake. I'm really, really sorry to everyone. Just really sorry.\" The timing couldn't be much worse for the Gators, who are ranked eighth by the media and 11th by the coaches. They play at Louisiana State, ranked sixth and fifth, on Saturday. … This past weekend was an example of what's right with college football. When the terrible flooding forced South Carolina to move its game against LSU to Baton Rouge, the Tigers couldn't have been more hospitable. LSU donated revenue from ticket sales to the Gamecocks, minus expenses for hosting the game. The school also raised money at the stadium for the American Red Cross, played the Gamecocks' hype video before the game and and showed South Carolina's state flag on the video board. … Georgia star running back Nick Chubb suffered a season-ending knee injury, but it wasn't to his anterior cruciate ligament. He is expected to undergo surgery in the next two weeks.\nAROUND THE MOUNTAIN WEST — Decker practiced on Sunday night, but his status for UNLV's game at Fresno State on Friday is undetermined. He did not play in Saturday's 33-27 overtime loss to San Jose State because of a dislocated nonthrowing shoulder. … Fresno State will again start quarterback Kilton Anderson, a redshirt freshman who made his first career start in Saturday's 56-14 loss to Utah State. Coach Tim DeRuyter is taking the long-term approach of hoping Anderson grows into the job. … Boise State plays at Utah State on Friday in a game what will shape the Mountain Division race.\nMY FINAL FOUR — I vote in the Sweet 16 Poll organized by the Football Writers Association of America and the National Football Foundation.\nHere is my top four:\n1. Baylor. The Bears' practices are more competitive than their 66-7 victory over Kansas.\n2. Ohio State. A big finish over Maryland kept the Buckeyes in this spot.\n3. Texas Christian. Let's not assume LSU's Leonard Fournette should be crowned the Heisman Trophy winner. TCU's Trevone Boykin is practically winning games by himself.\n4. Utah. The Utes were fortunate to get past California, but their overall resume is as strong as any team in the country.\nHEISMAN ODDS — Handicapper Bruce Marshall (goldsheet.com) provides Heisman Trophy odds each week:\nLeonard Fournette, LSU 6-5\nTrevone Boykin, TCU 5-2\nEzekiel Elliott, Ohio State 6-1\nDeshaun Watson, Clemson 10-1\nSeth Russell, Baylor 12-1\nDak Prescott, Mississippi State 15-1\nConnor Cook, Michigan State 18-1\nDalvin Cook, Florida State 20-1\nKevin Hogan, Stanford 22-1\nDerrick Henry, Alabama 25-1\nCardale Jones, Ohio State 25-1\nJared Goff, California 30-1\nBaker Mayfield, Oklahoma 30-1\nGreg Ward Jr., Houston 30-1\nMatt Johnson, Bowling Green 35-1\nPatrick Mahomes, Texas Tech 35-1\nEverett Golson, Florida State 40-1\nKeenan Reynolds, Navy 40-1\nDevontae Booker, Utah 45-1\nBrandon Doughty, Western Kentucky 50-1\nPaxton Lynch, Memphis 50-1\nRobert Nkemdiche, Mississippi 50-1\nPaul Perkins, UCLA 50-1\nJosh Doctson, TCU 75-1\nDeShone Kizer, Notre Dame 75-1\nJordan Canzeri, Iowa 100-1\nCorey Coleman, Baylor 100-1\nC.J.
