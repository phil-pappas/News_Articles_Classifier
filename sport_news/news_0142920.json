Church Point faces Port Barre on Friday. (Photo: Freddie Herpin/Daily World) \nPORT BARRE (4-1) at CHURCH POINT (4-1) \nLast week: Port Barre defeated Basile 18-7. Church Point lost to Franklinton 57-12. \nWhat’s the story? District 5-3A opens for both teams. Port Barre is off to one of its best starts in years. Look for the Devils’ defense to be challenged by Church Point, which has scored more than 30 points in four of five games. \nPlayers to watch: Port Barre – RB J.J. Sylvester, RB Terrance Lemelle, QB Austin Lanclos. Church Point – QB Troy Matte, RB Frederick Williams, RB-S Trey Babineaux \nCoaches speak: “This is a step up in competition for us. It’s a tough district opener.” — Port Barre head coach Mac Mistric \n“Port Barre is playing with some confidence right now and doing what they have to do. Their defense is playing well.” — Church Point head coach J.C. Arceneaux \nX-factor: Can Port Barre’s offense move the ball against a quicker and more physical Church Point defense? The Devils are also looking for someone to convert extra points. \nPower Ranking: Port Barre #5. Church Point #11 \nPINE PRARIIE (3-2) at NORTHWEST (4-1) \nLast week: Pine Prairie defeated Tara 28-6. Northwest defeated False River 28-0. \nWhat’s the story? Pine Prairie started the season with two losses but the Panthers are a different team since then. PPHS has made changes offensively, which has helped the Panthers’ offense. Northwest has developed an offensive attack that is becoming more versatile as the season progresses. The Raiders have four running backs that can deliver the damage. \nPlayers to watch: Pine Prairie – QB Dylan Doucet RB Douglas Fontenot. Northwest – RB Matthew Rideau, RB-S Matthew Angelle, QB Demarcus Stevens, RB-MLB Chris Lee \nCoaches speak: “Pine Prairie is doing more in the backfield now and they have some players there who can break one at any time on you. We have been working on our passing game which is improving to go along with our running game.” Northwest head coach Chris Edwards \nX-factor: Can the Raiders’ offense score enough points without an injured Chris Lee? \nPower Ranking: Pine Prairie #20. Northwest #29 \nEUNICE (4-1) at VILLE PLATTE (3-2) \nLast week: Eunice defeated Rayne 18-7. Ville Platte defeated Opelousas 13-7 \nWhat’s the story? Eunice has completed non-district with an offense that is performing at a high level. The Bobcats have an assortment of weapons that are tough to defend. Ville Platte has had its offensive problems all season but the Bulldogs have been steady defensively. Eunice’s main defensive concern is stopping Ville Platte running back Daylon Jones. \nPlayers to watch: Eunice – WR-DB Travis Godfrey, S-PLK-P Wesley Hebert, QB Alex Richard. Ville Platte – RB Daylon Jones, OL-DL Vondarius Freeman, QB Terez Alfred. \nCoaches speak: “Ville Platte has some athletes that can hurt you. (Jones) is a running back who has been impressive on tape. He plays the game hard. Their big lineman (Freeman) is very active and hard to block. They have a bunch of guys who stand out.” — Eunice High head coach Paul Trosclair \nX-factor: Can Ville Platte’s defense do enough to neutralize all the different ways that Eunice can score? \nPower Ranking: Eunice #4. Ville Platte #50. \nWESTMINSTER CHRISTIAN (4-1) at CATHOLIC-POINTE COUPEE (3-2) \nLast week: Westminster defeated Morgan City 28-21 (OT). Catholic beat Covenant Christian 38-20 \nWhat’s the story? This season has looked much differently at this point than the last two seasons for WCA. Head coach Vinnie Bullara has a full complement of assistants now and that has helped the Crusaders with building a youth team into one playing with confidence. Catholic-PC is a team that is beginning to discover an identity under a new coaching staff. \nPlayers to watch: WCA – CB Gene Kraemer, RB-LB Ken Jones, LB-RB Brandon Vidrine. \nCoaches speak: “Catholic High is playing this season with a new staff that has instilled some enthusiasm into the team. This is our district (5-1A) opener and one that we are really worried about at this point.” — Westminster head coach Vinnie Bullara \nX-factor: Can Westminster sufficiently defend the Catholic High Veer offense and option attack? \nPower Ranking: Westminster #5. Catholic Point Coupee #47 \nBEAU CHENE (4-1) at ST. THOMAS MORE (4-1) \nLast week: Beau Chene defeated St. Edmund 21-12. St. Thomas More defeated Hahnville 52-12. \nWhat’s the story? Both teams begin 4-4A with different perspectives on the first part of the season. The Gators have played down in classification in order to build confidence in a program that is developing under head coach Josh Guidry. The Cougars have played a menu of difficult opponents and looked primed to be a challenger in the district race. \nPlayers to watch: Beau Chene – RB Chris Williams, RB-QB Savion Broussard, RB-QB Deontrae Eaglin. \nCoaches speak: “We plan to run our offense like we have all season. I feel that gives us the best chance to win. STM is always so well coaches and so well prepared that we have to play virtually mistake free. Their quarterback (Will Bellamy) and receiver (Trevor Begue) work so well together that they will be a challenge for our defense.” — Beau Chene head coach Josh Guidry \nX-factor: The Gators cannot afford to fumble the way they have in the past several games. \nPower Ranking: Beau Chene #19. STM #2 \nBASILE (4-1) at NORTH CENTRAL (0-5) \nLast week: Basile lost to Port Barre 18-7. North Central lost to Albany 56-8 \nWhat’s the story? This is the District 5-1A opener for both teams. Basile last week had difficulty with Port Barre’s size. The Bearcats have a penchant for running the football. How well North Central does depends upon the ability of the Hurricanes to stop the Basile rushing attack. The Hurricanes have allowed 50 points or more in four of their five games. NCHS has scored 34 points for an average of just over a touchdown per game. \nPlayers to watch: Basile – QB Tray David, RB Gabe Fontenot. North Central – LB Austin Pitcher, RB Wilshawn Williams \nX-factor: North Central needs to play well early in order to develop some confidence. \nPower Ranking: Basile #2. North Central #38 \nST. EDMUND (1-4) at FALSE RIVER (2-3) \nLast week: St. Edmund lost to Beau Chene 21-12. False River lost to Northwest 28-0 \nWhat’s the story? The script has remained the same for St. Edmund most of the season. The Jays are failing to finish offensive drives. St. Edmund has converted 12-of-54 third down situations and just six of 18 fourth downs. \nPlayers to watch: St. Edmund – QB Drake Brunet, RB-WR Gibson Lafleur, \nX-factor: St. Edmund has the best passer-receiver combination in several parishes. Brunet has 1,122 passing yards. Lafleur has 40 receptionsn for 603 yards. How well they continue to perform is crucial for the Jays. \nPower Ranking: St. Edmund #16.
