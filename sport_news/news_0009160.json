I don't know. It's a question for other people, not me,\" the Argentinian said. \n\"I believe he knows he is in a big club and Liverpool have a lot of expectation. It's like us at Tottenham - there is the same pressure. In a few years we need to win some titles too, no? \n\"I think it's very good for the Premier League that he comes here. \n\"He impressed us with his job at Borussia Dortmund and we wish him all the best - after Saturday.\" \nPochettino led Southampton to eighth in his first full campaign in England, which equalled the club's highest league finish since 1990. \nSouthampton's players quickly adopted Pochettino's high-pressing style and he believes Klopp can make a similarly swift impact at Anfield. \n\"Convince the players they believe in your philosophy and your ideas - that's the first important thing,\" Pochettino said. \n\"Then you need to know the culture, the different mentality, the different football in England. \n\"When you are a manager like Klopp and you have the capacity to manage in the Champions League final, you have the skill to adapt your ideas to the new culture.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:10:22.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
