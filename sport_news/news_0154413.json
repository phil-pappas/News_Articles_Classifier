SMU will also appeal the penalty applied to men's golf that resulted in a postseason ban for the team and for individual competition, though that process could take weeks or months.\nU.S. Amateur champion Bryson DeChambeau has left SMU because of the penalties that, unless reversed, would keep the senior from defending his NCAA individual golf title next summer. DeChambeau last summer joined Jack Nicklaus, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Ryan Moore as the only players to win the U.S. Amateur and NCAA individual titles in the same year.\nThe basketball team will not have a chance to return to the NCAA Tournament at the end of the 2015-16 season after making the field last year for the first time since 1993. The tournament return last season came in Brown's third at SMU.\nIn their statement, the basketball players claimed they \"had no voice\" in the case and were denied due process. They also expressed their full support of Brown, who they called a great basketball coach, \"a life-skills teacher, a constantly available adviser, and a father figure to all of his players.\"\n\"The suggestion or conclusion that SMU basketball does not recognize the importance of NCAA rules and compliance with those rules cannot be farther from the truth,\" they said. \"Every single day, Coach Brown and our compliance staff remind and educate us about specific rules and the general principles of fair competition, honesty, and decency.\"\n\nMaryland's Trimble selected Big Ten Preseason Player of Year\nMaryland's Melo Trimble is the Big Ten Preseason Player of the Year.\nThe guard was selected by a panel of conference media after a strong freshman season in which he averaged 16.2 points and helped the Terrapins win 28 games.\nTrimble was also a unanimous preseason all-conference pick along with Michigan State's Denzel Valentine, Purdue's A.J. Hammons and Wisconsin's Nigel Hayes. Indiana's James Blackmon Jr., and Yogi Ferrell, Iowa's Jarrod Uthoff, Maryland's Jake Layman, Michigan's Caris LeVert and Wisconsin's Bronson Koenig also earned preseason all-Big Ten honors.\nThe selections were announced Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:16:03.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
