The Weston Ranch boys soccer team, the defending Sac-Joaquin Section Division IV and Valley Oak League champion, was on a 26-match VOL and 20-match home unbeaten streak entering Wednesday, dating to 2013. Oakdale, the reigning Section Division III champion, played patient soccer, unflinching defense and converted its opportunities, crushing the Cougars 4-1 in a VOL match Wednesday at Weston Ranch. “It was just the perfect storm against us,” Cisneros said. The Cougars (14-3-1, 5-1-0 VOL) are second behind Sierra (11-5-1, 5-0-1), which beat Modesto-Central Catholic 4-0 on Wednesday, in the VOL just ahead of the Mustangs (11-2-4, 4-0-2). Weston Ranch nearly scored first, as Bryant Ortiz’s cross was struck well by Deon Coffey, but just high above the crossbar. From there, the Mustangs held the ball firmly in the Cougars’ half of the pitch. Oakdale’s Bryce Hobbs delivered a header goal on a perfect cross of a free kick by Michael Arauza, taking a 1-0 lead in the sixth minute. Arauza played facilitator again half-an-hour later, sending a corner kick to Zidane Saucedo, who slammed it past the Cougars’ goalkeeper. “They’re pretty aggressive, they mark up quickly. But we’re better than we showed tonight,” said Cisneros, an Oakdale High graduate. “Be in rhythm, control the pace of the game, control the tempo.” Yet Weston Ranch, which prides itself on pensive, possession soccer, was often left trying for the long cross as Oakdale played patient defense. And the Mustangs, who have a few “hotheads,” as coach Alfredo Quiroga said, tempered their motivation from losing the VOL banner to the Cougars last autumn. Quiroga specifically warned against focusing on the past before their trip to Stockton, and it worked. “I have to basically tell them: ‘Look, you will not change anything that happened in the past. You cannot be thinking revenge,'\" Quiroga said. \"'You’ll be setting yourself up for disappointment, or worse, defeat.’” The Cougars were considerably more aggressive offensively to begin the second half. Four minutes after intermission, Joaquin Cortes corralled Kevin Medina’s free kick and smacked it into the net to halve the deficit. But Oakdale's Manuel Aguilar delivered a bending rocket of a goal for padding in the 51st minute. For the Mustangs’ fourth and final goal, Collin Harrity took advantage of the Weston Ranch keeper’s miscue. He failed to clear a corner kick, simply lofting the ball directly in front of him, and Harrity headed it in. “We’ve lost some games before,” said Medina, a senior captain. “It’s not going to bring us down.” On Monday, Weston Ranch hosts Sierra and junior Eddie Aguilar, the VOL’s leader with 24 goals. “Let’s just start the streak again, try not to lose any more games and bounce back,” said Medina, “come back stronger against Sierra.” — Contact reporter Thomas Lawrence at (209) 546-8272 or tlawrence@recordnet.com.
