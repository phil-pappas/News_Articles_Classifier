Such software was also the target of industry and government warnings about its security vulnerabilities.\nThe new details provide the first clues about Clinton's computer setup when she used it exclusively for her State Department correspondence. The AP found at least two other devices on Clinton's home network in New York whose purposes were unclear.\nClinton has since apologized for using the server. She has yet to detail how well it was secured, or if it received regular software updates that could have protected it from intrusions.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:22:54.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
