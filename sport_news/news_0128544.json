Peter Power/The Canadian Press files Photograph by: Peter Power , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nREGINA — The Saskatchewan Roughriders accomplished something while not doing very much at all. \nBy losing handily to the B.C. Lions and Hamilton Tiger-Cats, the Roughriders debunked the oft-advanced theory that they are not a bad football team. \nUltimately, those two gruesome games may be perceived as a catalyst for progress. \nThere was the danger of being ensnared in a trap as a result of believing that the Roughriders were simply a play or two, or a player or two, away from prosperity. \nSeven of Saskatchewan’s first 11 losses of the 2015 season were by four or fewer points. Given the prevalent nailbiters, it seemed that a measure of solace was derived from merely being close. (Cue the orchestra.) \nOf course, there were injuries aplenty. By halftime of the lidlifter on June 27, the Roughriders had lost for the season their No. 1 quarterback (Darian Durant) and their much-acclaimed middle linebacker (Shea Emry). The tone was set. \nSo, yes, the Roughriders were generally competitive through 13 games despite being ravaged by injuries and plagued by bad luck — or so the apologists asserted. \nThen came Oct. 3, when the Roughriders lost 46-20 in Vancouver. The score, lopsided as it was, flattered the Roughriders. They trailed 40-5 at one point. \nSix days later in Hamilton, Saskatchewan was behind 20-0 at halftime and 30-7 with two minutes left before the Roughriders scored a picturesque, yet meaningless, touchdown — courtesy of a 68-yard bomb from Brett Smith to Ryan Smith. The Smiths then collaborated on a two-point convert to conclude the scoring. \nShortly thereafter, the Roughriders were formally eliminated from contention for the 2015 CFL playoffs, bringing a welcome conclusion to several weeks of hypnotic, pie-in-the-sky banter about mathematical possibilities and, lest we forget, “we’ve still got a good football team.” \nReminder: This alleged “good football team” now sports a stellar 2-13 record. \nAfter back-to-back one-sided losses, nobody with even a scintilla of football acumen can credibly assert that the 2015 Riders are anything short of dreadful. \nLeading up to the games in Vancouver and Hamilton, Saskatchewan interim head coach Bob Dyce declared that 36-year-old Kevin Glenn would start at quarterback because he gave the Riders the best chance to win. \nWell, they would have the best chance to win a draft lottery, if the CFL had such a thing. \nThe first selection in the 2016 draft is an important starting point for a team that desperately needs to replenish its Canadian core. \nThe overall talent base also requires an upgrade — hardly an earth-shaking declaration when a team is 2-13 and a good bet to establish a franchise single-season record for losses (16). \nIf there was any doubt about what needs to transpire, it was removed during the Roughriders’ first two games of October. \nNow the path ahead for the Roughriders is clear. For many veterans, it will be a path out of town, given the apparent need to tear apart this hopeless team. \nThe current situation is not dissimilar to that of 2011, when an aging Roughriders team — the nucleus of which had appeared in two successive Grey Cup games — got old faster than “we’ve still got a good football team” and “we want ESPN!” \nFollowing the 2011 campaign, Brendan Taman — granted autonomy for the first time as the Riders’ general manager — embarked on a massive makeover. \nBy the time training camp arrived in 2012, only a handful of 30-somethings remained on the roster. The list of 30-somethings also included first-year head coach Corey Chamblin, who was another vital figure in the reconstruction of the Roughriders. \nOver the next two years, Taman and Chamblin added an assortment of aging players, but virtually all of them were productive in 2012 and/or 2013. \nAlthough there was an emphasis on the CFL’s free-agent market, key additions such as tailback Kory Sheets, wide receiver Taj Smith and left tackle Xavier Fulton made significant contributions to a team that was showered in green-and-white confetti on home soil after the 2013 Grey Cup game. \nSheets (the 2013 Grey Cup MVP) and Smith (who led the 2013 Roughriders with 78 receptions) had been signed as free agents. Fulton was acquired from the Edmonton Eskimos in 2012 for the low, low price of a sixth-round draft choice. \nNot long before that, the Roughriders had been a punch line. \nAt one point in the fall of 2011, Saskatchewan had gone 286 minutes 29 seconds without scoring an offensive touchdown. That is an enduring team record, by the way. \nAll of this is regurgitated simply to underline the point that a hapless team can be rebuilt in relatively short order. \nBut first, there has to be the undistracted realization that a losing aggregation of players must be dispassionately disassembled in time for next year’s training camp. \nThat point was reinforced on Friday, when the Roughriders were fed to the Tiger-Cats. \nThe spectacle was so somniferous that, with 5:34 remaining in the fourth quarter, TSN’s cameras showed Tiger-Cats head coach Kent Austin as he was yawning. \nIt was an unintentional, yet appropriate, commentary on the quality of the game and the sedate state of the Riders — who must still do everything possible to win … in 2016 and beyond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:00:58.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
