Pittsburgh Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams apparently wanted to become an exception, but the NFL shut it down, per ESPN's Field Yates. The NFL said no. — F... on.aol.com NFL star DeAngelo Williams is paying for 53 mammograms to honor his late mother, Sandra Hill, who died of breast cancer, WBT.com reported on Oct. 16. The news comes after Williams was denied a request he made to the league to allow him to wear pink for his uniform after October. Williams has already dyed his hair pink and painted his nails that color to recognize the fight against breast cancer which ultimately claimed his mother and four aunts.\nThe Today website noted on Oct. 14 that the Pittsburgh Steelers running back will pay for a total of 53 mammograms at hospitals which are in Charlotte, North Carolina and his team’s city, Pittsburgh. The total of 53 represents his mother’s age upon her passing. Back in 2009, Williams pushed for NFL players to wear pink cleats during October which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Other pink accessories or items have been seen before, during and after games in October, including headphones and pompoms.\nWhen Williams requested to be able to wear pink accessories during games for the remainder of the season he was told no by the NFL Vice President of football operations Tony Vincent. A statement issued by the NFL noted: \"There is a long-standing policy for all players regarding uniforms that is league-wide for all 32 teams. The league works with the clubs and players to raise awareness collectively for breast cancer during the month of October.\"\nSo Williams will instead help out those who are less fortunate and may be unable to pay for their mammograms. While insurance covers the procedure for most, there are uninsured individuals who will benefit from getting help with this particular medical expense. Williams’ Steelers are currently second in the AFC North with a 3-2 overall record and next play a home game against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://wbt.com/why-steelers-deangelo-williams-is-paying-for-53-mammograms/", "http://www.today.com/health/deangelo-williams-pays-53-mammograms-honor-mom-who-died-breast-t50306"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:17:50.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
