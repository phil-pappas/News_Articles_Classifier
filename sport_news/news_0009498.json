While the undrafted rookie from SDSU only rushed twice for nine yards, friends and family are relishing his run in the NFL. \nBack in Brookings where he made a name for himself scoring touchdowns and racking up yards, there's still a lot of talk about Zenner. \nYou might think having a brother playing in the NFL would be a life-changing experience for a person. But for Zach's younger brother Sam, he's been watching his elder hit the gridiron for years. \n\"Not much has changed. Not much has changed from even high school. We obviously support him. My dad wants to see all of his games. Just like back in high school,\" Sam Zenner said. \nBoth Zach and Sam played quarterback for their team in Eagan, Minnesota. The two look a lot alike and even have a similar style when it comes to dashing for long touchdowns. \nA lifelong fan of the Minnesota Vikings, Sam found himself in an awkward position when the Detroit Lions visited TCF Bank Stadium a few weeks ago. \n\"Wearing a Lions jersey and everyone else wearing purple. Usually I'm a Vikings fan so it was an odd experience,\" Sam said. \nHe's been having plenty of those on campus at South Dakota State. The red-shirt freshman, currently battling injury, has had to talk about big brother probably more than he'd like. Sam, a high school swimming and track state champion takes it in stride. \n\"Unfortunately, he's probably been called Zach way too many times because of the connection. But he rolls with the punches and I know he wouldn't want it any other way than to have to earn his spot,\" head coach John Stiegelmeier said. \nBecause of Zach's success as a Jackrabbit, including All-American honors and three 2,000-plus rushing seasons, expectations were high for Sam as soon as he stepped on campus. \n\"Sam is faster than Zach was. Sam is bigger than Zach was when he got here. So the pressure is on Sam to be better than Zach,\" Stiegelmeier said. \nThat's not exactly how Sam sees it but there's no doubt a brotherly competition is going on. \n\"I wouldn't say we're competitive in like trying to outdo each other. It's more like if we're playing Xbox, I want to be him, really badly, because he's my brother,\" Sam said. \nBoth take after each other on the academic side as well. Sam is hoping to become an electrical engineer and says Zach wants to be a surgeon. One thing's for sure, they've both come a long way from backyard football and both have a lot of work ahead of them. Matt Holsen: Is the NFL a dream for you? Zenner: Yeah. I mean it has been from when I was a kid obviously. That's every little football player's dream obviously to be an NFL player but just focusing right now on my career here. Hoping to do well. Holsen: 1-0 each week. Sam: Yes sir. Exactly. \nAs for Coach Stig, recruiting brothers to play at State is nothing new for his program. He's created a family atmosphere in Brookings. He just might have to wait a while for the next Zenner once Sam's career is over. Stiegelmeier: Zach is getting married in March and so if they get things going, who knows? If I can hang in there long enough. The last name will be Zenner. Holsen: That's funny. There's a cousin out there. Stiegelmeier: I have not heard about the cousin. Holsen: He's got an eighth grade cousin. Stiegelmeier: We will get that information. I don't want to do any illegal recruiting here but we're excited to have both. \nThere is another Zenner at SDSU as well. Sister Abby is a senior on the Jackrabbit swimming and diving team.
