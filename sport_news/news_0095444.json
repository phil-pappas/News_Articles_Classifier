Essential monthly and annual service and maintenance checks are included in all packages, however each package is designed around different boat specifications, use of boat, personnel needed, etc., to reduce unnecessary expenses and hassle for Marine Centre International clients.\n\"Boat owners do not want a one fits all fee offered by many yacht service companies, as this often includes redundant costs and is based on an impersonal service with no deep understanding of either the owner’s or the specific boat needs. This is why more and more boat owners switch to our company for the management of their yacht.\n\"We have always been offering tailored yacht service and management options, all with the same quality level, so we decided to package these options and make them even simpler and more straight forward for boat owners. This, together with the personal relationship we establish with each client and our 24-7 availability, reassures them that they have the most thorough and cost effective service available,\" says Sandy Koukoura, Communications Director of Marine Centre International.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:26:49.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
