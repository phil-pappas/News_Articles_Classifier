Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 9:20 pm Cubs win Game 2, draw even \nST. LOUIS (AP) â€” Kyle Hendricks and Addison Russell had successful squeeze bunts and Jorge Soler capped a five-run second with a two-run homer, and the Chicago Cubs held off the St. Louis Cardinals 6-3 on Saturday night to even their NL Division Series at a game apiece. \nManager Joe Maddon made all the right moves a night after the Cubs lost the opener 4-0. Now the teams shift to Wrigley Field for Game 3 Monday, where Chicago's 22-game winner Jake Arrieta faces St. Louis' Michael Wacha in the best-of-five series. \nThe usually steady NL Central champion Cardinals made two errors as the Cubs didn't hit the ball out of the infield in scoring their first three runs in the second. \nPlaying in his first postseason game, Soler connected off Jaime Garcia (0-1), who was lifted because of a stomach ailment after the second inning. \nDexter Fowler, Soler and Starlin Castro each had two of Chicago's six hits in a game played in front of a crowd of 47,859, a postseason record at 10-year-old Busch Stadium, that included thousands of Cubs fans. \nBesides the two-run homer, Soler doubled and walked twice in the Cubs' first postseason victory since 2003. Chicago had lost seven straight Division Series games. \nThe Cardinals homered three times, including a leadoff long ball by Matt Carpenter. Consecutive shots by Kolten Wong and pinch-hitter Randal Grichuk with two outs in the fifth chased Hendricks one out shy of qualifying for the victory in his postseason debut. \nTravis Wood (1-0) allowed one hit with two strikeouts in 2 1-3 scoreless innings for the victory. Hector Rondon, briefly stuck in the bullpen bathroom during Game 1, earned the save. \nGarcia left because of a stomach virus after a sloppy second inning. Though none of the runs were earned, the lefty's first postseason start since 2012 was a disaster. \nThe Cubs capitalized when Garcia blew a play on a safety squeeze by Hendricks. The pitcher hesitated instead of throwing home with a very good chance of cutting down the run, then made a wild, flat-footed throw to first for an error. \nRussell, the next batter, squeezed in another run, and Dexter Fowler had an RBI infield hit before Soler drove a high 2-2 pitch over the center field wall. \nLance Lynn, the presumptive Game 4 starter, replaced Garcia in the third as the first in a parade of relievers. \nTwo-time 20-game winner Adam Wainwright, coming off a torn left Achilles in late April, fanned three in 1 2-3 scoreless innings, his fourth appearance since being injured and first of more than an inning. \nHendricks allowed three homers in 4 2-3 innings. He had 17 no-decisions in the regular season, most in the majors.
