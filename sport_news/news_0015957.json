Sager Sr. has been battling leukemia: 18 days early, on Day 82, Sr. has been cleared & is coming home for good WHAT A FIGHT! Thank you MD Anderson & everyone that believed in him \nâ€” Craig Sager II (@CraigSagerJr) October 7, 2015 \nAnd now comes more good news: TNT announced Friday that Sager, 64, will be back at work on NBA opening night, working the sideline at the Pelicans-Warriors game on Oct. 27. \nThinking that his leukemia was in full remission after his initial treatment, Sager returned to the TNT sideline in March. But he was forced to step down again later that month after the cancer returned.
