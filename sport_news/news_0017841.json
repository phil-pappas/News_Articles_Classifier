Lee taking care of Nederland on, off court 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nMarlie Lee knows she wants to enter the nursing field following graduation, but until then, she'll settle for taking care of her team. \nNederland's senior outside hitter spends her mornings with HOSA (Health Occupations Students of America) working towards her TMA (Trained Medication Aide) license, which she'll earn in February. \nHer afternoons however, belong to the Lady Bulldogs. \n\"She's one of those people who will always put her teammates and everybody else above herself,\" Nederland coach Kristin Lemoine said. \"She's very selfless. Going into nursing, she wants to care for other people and make them feel good.\" \nLee, who doubles as the Lady Bulldogs captain and kill leader, has been ignoring a nagging shoulder injury on her hitting arm that could easily keep her out of matches. \nBut the future nurse is all about disregarding doctor's orders. \n\"I know I should be taking care of my body, but I've got to take care of my team first,\" Lee said. \"They need me.\" \nLee has preserved her shoulder the last two district matches by playing in the back row, but says she's ready to unleash everything at 6:30 p.m. today when they play host to Goose Creek in a pivotal District 22-5A matchup. \n\"They've been saving me,\" Lee said, \"but I'm ready to go.\" \nGoose Creek (9-0 district) defeated Nederland, who is 23-11 overall and 8-1 in district, 25-19, 34-32, 25-19 in September, but since the loss, the Lady Bulldogs have won six straight matches. \n\"She just wants to compete and be there for her teammates,\" Lemoine said. \"No matter what.\" \nAccording to Lemoine, Lee's maturity and wisdom makes her an easy person to follow. \n\"She's one of those people that the other girls turn to and say 'Marlie what do I do, I need your advice,'\" said Lemoine, who attends matches despite being on maternity leave. \"She's there to coach. Even with me not there, she has stepped up into this huge role to make sure the girls are getting what they need.\" \nLemoine will lean on her six-man senior class – Lee, Emma Forsythe , Caroline and Courtney Noel , Payton Swanson and Tatum Kieschnick – to get a win in what she calls \"the biggest game of the district season.\" \n\"Having a dominant senior class that can pass the knowledge down to the younger ones is such a valuable thing,\" Lemoine said. \"I think we started to doubt ourselves a little in that game, but it won't happen again.\" Southeast Texas sports news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:43:49.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
