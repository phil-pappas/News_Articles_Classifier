No respect. No respect, and I am not speaking about football.\n\"In football I am ready to accept any kind of critic, even the stupid ones, but my private life and stupid things that you being to the light, I don't like it, so we have a different level of professional relations.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:51:38.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
