The entire world could see that the Steelers, down three points to the Chargers on Monday Night Football, were putting the game in the hands of their workhorse power back.\nMost NFL coaches in this situation would likely choose the conservative route, kicking an overtime-forcing field goal, even if simple probability tells us that’s ill-advised. Some might pass. Very few, I’d bet, would trust the game in their running back’s hands.\nBut that’s what the Steelers did, and on his second effort, Bell broke the plane and Pittsburgh walked off with a win in San Diego. It’s a decision that might’ve been questioned, had the result been different. But Coach Mike Tomlin’s reasoning for the gamble was simple and obvious.\n“We’ve got Le’Veon Bell,” Tomlin told reporters. “We have to play to win.”\nReally, all he had to say was the first part. As Pittsburgh’s only reliable source of offense Monday night, Bell touched the ball 25 times for 127 yards (5.08 yards per touch), while quarterback Mike Vick, not counting his fourth-quarter, 72-yard anomaly touchdown to Markus Wheaton, averaged just 5.24 yards per pass attempt.\nIn the NFL, where the running back position as we once knew it is changing faster than ever, it’s increasingly rare to see an offense rely on a running back pounding the ball early and often like the Steelers do with Bell. Who else – aside from maybe Minnesota with Adrian Peterson – would confidently make the statement Tomlin did after Monday’s win?\nThis season, only two running backs have three games with at least 20 carries: Chicago’s Matt Forte and Tampa Bay’s Doug Martin. Even Peterson has 17 fewer carries through four games than he did through four in his most recent full season (2013).\nThe devaluing of running backs isn’t a new phenomenon, of course. Before Todd Gurley and Melvin Gordon last season, we’d gone two years without any running backs drafted in the first round. After boasting at least 15 1,000-yard rushers per year from 2002-12, the NFL only had 13 in each of the past two seasons. It’s on par for the same total again this season.\nBut this season is unquestionably different than the past two, in that a changing of the guard appears to be on the horizon. Five of the top 10 rushers in 2013 and 2014 were the same. The same ratio holds from 2012 to 2013 and from 2010 to 2011.\nOf the top 10 rushers last season, only one currently graces the top 10 in rushing yards in 2015 – Ravens running back Justin Forsett. Though, on a per-game basis, Bell would also be in that company.\nJust take a look at a few of the players averaging 5 yards per carry or more this season: Gurley, Thomas Rawls, Dion Lewis and Karlos Williams. An odd list, yes? Lewis was a free agent last year. Rawls was undrafted last spring. Williams was a fourth-round pick. And Gurley, well, OK, he’s superhuman.\nAnd those previously in the top 10 have struggled. DeMarco Murray, last year’s leading rusher, has floundered behind Philadelphia’s brutal offensive line. Marshawn Lynch, Arian Foster and LeSean McCoy have battled injuries. Cincinnati’s Jeremy Hill, Green Bay’s Eddie Lacy and Miami’s Lamar Miller have been mostly ineffective or used less consistently.\nWith offenses continuing to change, running backs are adapting to vastly different roles than they have in the past – especially in the passing games. As receiving backs become more valuable, eight rank in the NFL’s top 50 in receptions through five weeks, up from just three last season. Seven running backs are averaging more than five targets per game through five weeks. Only two (Forte and Fred Jackson) managed to uphold that rate last season. Ground-and-pound backs, it seems, are being edged out of their own backfields.\nInstead, we’re left this season with two 5-foot-8 running backs as perfect bastions of the changing times. Falcons running back Devonta Freeman is just 22nd in rushing yards per carry (4.4). Lewis, the Patriots’ all-purpose back, has only 36 carries for 180 yards. Both have proved themselves this season as two of the most dangerous backfield weapons in the NFL.\nFreeman, for one, has eight touchdowns and trails only Bell in yards per game from scrimmage. The Falcons’ diminutive back has been unstoppable thus far, breaking tackles on the interior and doing damage in space. There’s an argument to be made that he’s the NFL’s most valuable non-quarterback through five games.\nLewis, meanwhile, has given the Patriots what they’d always hoped for – but never got – from Shane Vereen. Fifth in yards per game from scrimmage, Lewis has more catches than Seattle tight end Jimmy Graham. But as he showed in a late, highlight-reel touchdown in which he broke three Cowboys tackles Sunday, he has running back skills, through and through.\nIn all, Lewis tallied eight broken tackles on 14 touches in Sunday’s game. That’s an insane rate under any circumstances. And for the old guard of workhorse backs looking for touches in a changing NFL landscape – the likes of Lynch, McCoy and others – it might just be a sign that the NFL’s rapid evolution at running back is primed to leave them behind sooner rather than later.\nContact the writer: rkartje@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:09:35.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
