When the gates finally did open at noon, the cars remained out of sight in the garages.\n\"The rain is so hard that no wet tire can take the cars round safely. Why we are all wasting our time for delays, delays, delays?,\" said Mercedes non-executive chairman and retired triple champion Niki Lauda.\n\"It is the only decision that could be taken because it was not possible to drive out there,\" said Rosberg after the final postponement. \"Let's hope we can drive tomorrow morning, that will be important.\"\nSUZUKA TYPHOON\nFormula One has held qualifying sessions on the Sunday before now, most recently in Australia in 2013 when rain and poor light forced the delay.\nThe Japanese Grands Prix in 2004 and 2010 also had Sunday qualifying due to a typhoon and rainstorms lashing the Suzuka circuit.\nThe rains, fueled by the remnants of Hurricane Patricia that hit Mexico's Pacific coast on Friday, inundated many parts of Texas and triggered flash floods.\nThe race start is scheduled for 1400 local, by which time the weather is expected to have improved.\nWith hardy fans huddling in the grandstands, teams and drivers did their best to keep spirits up with a range of pitlane antics relayed on the television screens.\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat performed country dancing moves, Rosberg played around with a soccer ball and a Force India mechanic showed off some breakdancing.\nToro Rosso's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen produced a fishing rod while father Jos, a former F1 racer, donned overalls and helmet and squeezed into the car while team mate Carlos Sainz's father did the same.\nSauber mechanics 'paddled' down the pitlane in a crate on wheels, with a propeller on the end, pulled by others.\n(Editing by Frank Pingue/Andrew Both)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:11:22.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
