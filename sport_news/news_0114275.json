He upstaged Lamar’s Kade Harrington, the leading rusher in the Southland Conference who had 254 yard on 24 carries and two touchdowns. \nThe victory kept the Bears (4-3, 4-1) a game behind McNeese State in the Southland Conference race. \n“It was bad weather but beautiful weather for running the football,” said UCA coach Steve Campbell, whose Bears won their third Southland game on the road. “Before the game, Blake told coach Brown (offensive coordinator Nathan) to give him the rock, that he was ready to have a good game. We needed to run the football tonight.” \n“I was in a zone before the game began,” said Veasley, who gave a lot of credit to the Bears’ offensive line and posed for pictures with them afterwards. \nUCA intercepted five passes, two by Tyler Williams and one each by Bobby Watkins, Tre Smith and Devin Spurlock. \nVeasley helped UCA start quickly, scoring on a 1-yard run after a pass reception by Desmond Smith. He scored on a 14-yard run to put UCA (which added a two-point conversion after the first touchdown) to put the Bears up 15-0 in the first quarter. Two 21-yard field goals by Jace Denker pushed the lead to 21-3 at the half. Veasley ran through a big hole 56 yards for a touchdown to put UCA up 28-3 early in the third quarter but that was quickly matched by a 65 run by Harrington. \nHarrington broke for a 50-yard touchdown with 1:44 left in the third quarter but Veasley matched that with a 19-yard run early in the fourth quarter to give Bears a cushion at 35-17. \nUCA quarterback Hayden Hildebrand completed 11 of 17 passes for 154 yards before leaving the game in the third quarter with shoulder and hand injuries. Kirk Baugh finished the game, relying heavily on Veasley. The record for carries and yardage in a game were both held by Vaughn Edwards. \nThe Bears return home for two straight games beginning with their homecoming game Saturday night against Southeastern Louisiana.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:54:07.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
