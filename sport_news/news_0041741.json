(AP) - Carolina Hurricanes defenseman James Wisniewski will need surgery for a knee injury. \nThe team said in release Friday that Wisniewski will have surgery to repair a torn left anterior cruciate ligament and will face an estimated six-month recovery time. He was injured during Thursday’s game at Nashville after skating just 47 seconds in his debut with the Hurricanes. \nCarolina acquired the 31-year-old Wisniewski from Anaheim in June in exchange for goaltender Anton Khudobin. \nCarolina plays its home opener Saturday against Detroit. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:28:40.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
