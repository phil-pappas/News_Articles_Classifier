It’s just part of the game — not a dirty part because it’s a scary part of the game being a middle infielder because you can be put in vulnerable positions, and that was one of them right there.\n“I feel bad for Ruben, because he didn’t want to get taken out, nor was he ready to get taken out. He was kind of doing a spin, trying to make a play. Chase coming in, doing what he did, you can see both sides of it being a clean slide and also being a dirty slide. It’s a tough situation to talk about.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:32:37.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
