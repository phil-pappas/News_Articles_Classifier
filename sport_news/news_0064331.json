(Jack Dempsey/Associated Press) \nThe Denver Broncos‚Äô Von Miller has made a habit this season of paying tribute to a skit from the ‚ÄúKey and Peele‚Äù show with celebratory pelvic thrusts , an homage to the late legendary wrestler ‚ÄúRavishing‚Äù Rick Rude . The NFL doesn‚Äôt like that habit, however, and fined Miller $11,567 for ‚Äúunsportsmanlike conduct‚Äù after the celebratory ‚Äúdance‚Äù followed a sack of Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford during the Broncos‚Äô game in Detroit in Week 3. \n[ Oct. 4: Von Miller was about to do his sack dance, then remembered that he‚Äôs been fined for it ] \nKeegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, the show‚Äôs stars, decided to turn the situation into a good deed this week and donated the amount of the fine to Miller‚Äôs charity, ‚ÄúVon‚Äôs Vision,‚Äù which provides Denver-area children with eye care and eyewear. Preciate u @KeeganMKey & @JordanPeele for showing love to #vonsvision Thrust fine = 450+ pairs of glasses for kids!! pic.twitter.com/v337cJdgjY \n‚Äî Von Miller (@Millerlite40) October 16, 2015 Thank you Von!
