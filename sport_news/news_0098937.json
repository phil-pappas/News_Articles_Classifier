(AP) â€” The Green Bay Packers stopped San Diego on fourth-and-goal from the 3 with 15 seconds left and overcame a career day by Philip Rivers to hold off the Chargers 27-20 on Sunday.\nRivers set career highs with 43 completions, 65 attempts and 503 yards passing. He threw for two touchdowns for the Chargers (2-4). But he needed one more completion.\nRookie cornerback Damarious Randall lunged to poke away Rivers' short pass to Danny Woodhead near the front right pylon in the final seconds.\nThe fans inside Lambeau Field erupted with a collective sigh of relief. Green Bay (6-0) survived its biggest scare of the year to stay unbeaten.\nThe Packers started strong and finished barely in front. Running back James Starks had touchdowns on a 65-yard run and a 5-yard pass in the first quarter.\n__\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:53:32.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
