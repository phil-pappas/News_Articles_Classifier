Devils defenseman Andy Greene reached behind goaltender Cory Schneider in the opening 23 seconds and pulled Rick Nash 's shot off the goal line before it went across. \nLundqvist stole one from the Devils with 2:35 left, coming across the crease to stop Kyle Palmieri on his doorstep. \nBlues 4, Jets 2: Vladimir Tarasenko scored twice and Brian Elliott made 26 saves. Tarasenko gave the Blues a 3-2 lead on a delayed penalty midway through the third, firing a shot past goalie Ondrej Pavelec and into the corner of the net for his fifth goal of the season. Scottie Upshall and Carl Gunnarsson also scored for St. Louis. The Blues have won four straight to improve to 5-1-0. \nDucks 4, Wild 1: Anton Khudobin had 34 saves, and Anaheim got goals from Cam Fowler, Rickard Rakell , Mike Santorelli and Hampus Lindholm to beat Minnesota for its first victory of the season. \nOilers 2, Canucks 1 (OT): Lauri Korpikoski 's breakaway goal won it in overtime.
