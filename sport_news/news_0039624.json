His instinctive spin move on one touchdown provoked can-you-believe-that?! gasps across the country.\nIn the month after that, though, Miller was mostly quiet. He had only five catches in the next four games and didn’t do much as a runner when he lined up at quarterback.\nAgainst Maryland last week, Miller had what the Buckeyes hope was a breakthrough. On consecutive plays, he made a diving catch of a deep Cardale Jones pass and then got open for a 19-yard touchdown. He finished with five catches.\n“Oh, man,” Miller said, “about time. It just felt good being involved in the offense and making plays for the guys and being electrifying for the fans and getting back to my old self.”\nOhio State coach Urban Meyer gushed even more about Miller’s blocking, a job requirement for Buckeyes receivers. Meyer noted that even Miller’s highlight-reel plays against Virginia Tech didn’t earn him a “champion” grade in that game because his blocking wasn’t up to par.\n“Every practice and every game, I get better at something,” Miller said. “I’m ahead of schedule. I feel comfortable, and I’m out there making plays and blocking.”\nRelinquishing the position of quarterback is difficult for most players who have played that position. Quarterbacks touch the ball every play. They are the offense’s alpha male. They are the center of attention.\nMiller has never cared about attention. His transition, he said, hasn’t been difficult.\n“Not in my situation,” he said.\nAfter all, a quarterback who doesn’t throw can’t be a quarterback. Although Miller said, “My shoulder is good,” he doesn’t trust it enough after two surgeries to cut loose.\n“I can throw,” he said. “I don’t think it’s important for me right now to be throwing. My main focus is on playing receiver and focusing on what I have to for my position.”\nMiller does miss having the ball in his hands every play. He laughed when asked if he has complained to Ohio State’s quarterbacks about not getting the ball enough.\n“I did,” Miller said. “I was like, dang, I used to go through the same situation.”\nMeyer has no problem with a receiver asking for more touches.\n“Every good, quality player wants the football, and we don’t discourage that,” he said. “That goes back to my days in 1986 when Cris Carter was playing receiver. He wanted the ball. What did Coach (Earle) Bruce do? Gave him the ball. We don’t look at that as a negative.”\nOn Saturday night, the Buckeyes play host to Penn State. In State College in 2012, Miller made one of the most memorable plays of his career. On a designed run for Carlos Hyde at Penn State’s 1-yard line, Miller noticed in a split-second that a blitzing defensive end would have, in his words, “decapitated” Hyde. So he kept the ball, instinctively stepped back to make a defender miss and then dived into the end zone for a touchdown.\n“They thought Carlos had the ball,” Miller said. “The crowd got super-excited. I felt the vibration. The next thing they knew, they saw me dive into the end zone — and then it got quiet.”\nMiller might not be capable of throwing the ball like he used to, but his legs remain just fine. If his time as a quarterback is over, Miller will try to succeed this year and in the NFL as a receiver.\nBuckeyes receiver Jalin Marshall said he could tell that Miller savored last week’s performance.\n“I think it’s that way for him every week just because it’s his last season,” Marshall said. “He wants the best for us and the best for himself.\n“Him not being involved for a couple weeks, he probably was a little down. But he knew his time was coming, and his time will continue to come.”\nbrabinowitz@dispatch.com \n@brdispatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:20:31.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
