Cartersville is still ranked No. 1 so we’ve played some tough teams coming into the region.”But last week, North Paulding failed to build on that momentum due to a 35-13 setback against Harrison.“They threw the ball one time,” Jones said. “They just ran the football but turnovers are what really hurt us. We lost two fumbles and threw two interceptions and that really helped with most of their points. We just can’t do that against any of these teams. They are all good and well coached. We got to take care of the football.”“We have been looking for an overall team victory in all aspects of the game and I think we got that,” Harrison coach Matt Dickmann said. “Defense made some big plays, offense had some big drives and some big runs. I’m just happy it was an overall team victory.”The Wolfpack defense surrendered 228 rushing yards and two touchdowns to Darius Clark. Justin Fields and C.J. Turner also ran for TDs.“For us it’s a big step for our program,” Dickmann said. “We’re in the driver’s seat for a playoff spot and we’re controlling our own destiny now. We have still got to take it one step at a time. It was a big step forward but we have to keep taking steps forward and not back.”D.J. Owens and Charles Benton had rushing touchdowns for the Wolfpack, who meet a Hillgrove team coming off a 19-7 loss to North Cobb last week.“Hillgrove is very sound,” Jones said. “Offensively they run the spread and their quarterback runs the ball well. They are well balanced and always pose a big threat offensively.”Jones believes the Hawks’ defense will definitely challenge his offense.“Defensively, they’ve got some very active players,” Jones said. “Their linebackers are physical so we are just going to have to match their physicality. This past week it was nasty out and we like to throw the football so we had some dropped balls and mishaps. Hopefully, the weather straightens up and gives us a little better surface to play on.”Last year when these teams met, they combined for 118 points with Hillgrove winning 72-46.“I think there will be some points scored in the game,” Jones said. “They’ve got a high-powered offense and we’re certainly capable of it. Really the key to me is our defense slowing them down. If we make them work for their points that would be better unlike last year when it was like a track meet out there.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:43:56.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
