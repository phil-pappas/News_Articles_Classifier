A Brooklyn assemblyman has joined the growing chorus of politicians and prosecutors who are looking to regulate daily fantasy sports, including the two enterprise giants, FanDuel and DraftKings.\nFelix Ortiz, the Puerto Rican-born assistant speaker of the New York State Assembly, said he is introducing legislation to \"regulate 'Fantasy Sports' wagering,\" according to a press release issued by Ortiz's office Monday.\n\"This lucrative and unregulated industry must be controlled before consumers are hurt and to prohibit any illegality,\" Ortiz said in the release. \"New York must act now and lead the states looking to assure residents that their participation is in a safe and secure environment. It is our responsibility to safeguard against compulsive and underage wagering, money laundering and identity fraud. Let's not drop the ball on this new fad from regulation and oversight.\"\nLast week, the Nevada Gaming Control Board barred both FanDuel and DraftKings from operating in the state without a requisite license. And New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has already reached out to to both companies to inquire about their policies. The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have also launched a federal probe into the companies, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, but the investigation is in a \"preliminary stage,\" according to the report.\nOrtiz (D-Kings) told the Daily News Monday that he isn't afraid to stand up to corporations or businesses if he feels like the consumer is being exploited.\n\"This is what we get elected to do. We shouldn't be afraid to put up a fight and be an advocate for the most vulnerable population,\" said Ortiz. \"It's important to dig into the legal perspective, and it's my intention to introduce legislation to regulate this industry. These companies are spending some $84 million to promote their industry.\"\nOrtiz said that he will continue to speak with regulators and other politicians around the country to establish a \"consensus approach\" to the proposed legislation, and that he will work with Schneiderman to draft the bill. Ortiz said there will be a public hearing within one or two months after the bill is drafted.\n\"The consumer should never be taken for granted,\" said Ortiz.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:13:41.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
