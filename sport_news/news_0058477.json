Horseheads finished 5-8-1, leaving the Raiders one victory shy of the .400 winning percentage needed to qualify for sectionals. \n\"They've been a great group to coach. They gave me their best every time in practice and in games,\" Horseheads head coach Mark Mucci said. \"I'm just sad their season had to end this way.
