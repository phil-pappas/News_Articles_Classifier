I feel like my team is pretty excited too,\" said West York wide receiver, Terry Cains. \"I can't wait until Friday\" \n\n\"I'm very excited, very hype,\" said York Suburban running back, Dajour Henderson. \"The team's excited and we're ready to go.\" \n\nWest York is currently 2-4 after a rough start to the season. But the Bulldogs believe they are better than what their record shows. \n\n\"We started out rough but we're really coming together as a team right now,\" said West York quarterback, Tyler Folk. \"I'm looking forward to the next couple of weeks.\" \n\n\"At first we were pretty shaky because we didn't have much experience,\" explained Cains. \"But we're starting to come together as a team. I feel like we're coming together as one and a better team overall\" \n\nYork Suburban is on a four game winning streak pushing their record to 4-2. The Trojan's quarterback Thomas Merkle helping to set the tone for the team. In week 6, Merkle set a school passing record which was established back in 1998. \n\"It's an awesome experience to just have my name up there with some of those guys,\" said Merkle. \n\n\"I was very glad to see that he broke that record,\" said Henderson. \"He worked for it\" \n\nBoth teams are undefeated in the division at 2-0. Winner in Friday night's match up would have a shot at winning a division title. \n\n\"It's going to be a tough game. West York always plays tough at home.\" explains York Suburban head coach Andy Loucks. \"In the last 7 or 8 years they've been the team you had to beat in York in terms of division II if you wanted to get a championship.\" \n\n\"We understand this plays a large role in terms of our goals,\" said West York head coach Jeremy Jones. \"We got to take care of this week and try and prepare as best as we can\" \n\nKick off is set for 7 pm at West York High School.
