(Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) K.C. Johnson Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Is Nikola Mirotic a small or power forward or both? \nNikola Mirotic didn't live up to his Twitter handle last postseason; @threekola shot 30.6 percent from beyond the arc on 66 attempts in 11 playoff games. \nSo Taj Gibson's scouting report from the first few days of Bulls training camp should be encouraging for a player projected to play a huge role this season under new coach Fred Hoiberg. \n\"His 3-pointers are much more consistent,\" Gibson said. \nMirotic comes to camp fresh off his first stint with the Spanish national team, for which he teamed with most valuable player Pau Gasol in a gold-medal performance in the EuroBasket tournament. Mirotic shot a below-average 35.5 percent in that competition from the shorter international 3-point distance. \nEven during his down periods in a transitory rookie season, Mirotic remained secure in his shooting ability. \n\"I always have confidence,\" he said. \"I trust myself and I'm still young. I've played a lot of important games in my career, this summer too. They're expecting me to help the team. I'm excited.\" \nThe question is: From what position? \nMike Dunleavy's unexpected back surgery has created an opportunity at small forward. Mirotic alternately looked comfortable and confused at the position last season. \nHoiberg said he has used Mirotic more as a stretch power forward in camp but wouldn't limit him. \n\"Niko's a basketball player — and very versatile,\" Hoiberg said. \"He's more comfortable at (power forward) right now because that's where he's getting a lot of reps early on. But we've been sticking around after and getting together early, putting him at (small forward) so he can learn that as well.\" \nMirotic, for his part, said the more the merrier — although he admitted to the defensive challenges inherent in playing small forward. \n\"I feel comfortable staying at (power forward), opening the floor against big guys,\" he said. \"But sometimes if they need me at (small forward), I should be ready. I need to learn the plays and be ready on defense too.\" \nGasol touted Mirotic's ability to step up in another rookie situation after extensive international experience with the Spanish junior national team. Mirotic averaged 12.7 points in EuroBasket. \n\"His performance was critical to help us win the championship,\" Gasol said. \"I saw he matured as the championship went on. He was able to lock in more game after game. Very happy that he was able to be part of our team and help us win a gold medal.\" \nLayups: Derrick Rose had his follow-up exam on his surgically repaired left orbital fracture and is expected to be cleared to watch practice shortly. \"He's in great spirits,\" Hoiberg said. ... Gibson, who underwent left ankle surgery in June, doesn't know if he'll be ready for the Oct. 27 opener. \"My body's up and down,\" he said. \"For every good day I have, I may be sore another two days.\" ... Hoiberg said he's committed to trying the starting pairing of Gasol and Joakim Noah in at least one exhibition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:46:55.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
