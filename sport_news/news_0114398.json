Malvern Prep defeated visiting Haverford, 1-0. \n\"We have a dance tonight,\" Narzikul said, smiling. \"We didn't want anyone to say, 'How'd you guys do?' and we lost.\" \nThe Fords (12-3, 3-1 Inter-Ac) came into the contest outscoring opponents 37-7, and had posted four straight shutouts. The Friars (11-1-2, 3-1), meanwhile, were coming off a loss to Penn Charter, and were without their two starting center backs, Andrew Panzo and Connor Dillon, due to concussions. \nThey did, however, have, goalkeeper Jake Hodlofski. \n\"He played out of his mind,\" Narzikul said of the sophomore's performance. \nThat he did. Hodlofski registered nine saves, including several huge stops late. None were bigger than the one he made with about a minute left, when he found himself to be the only thing standing between Connor Gregory and the net. \n\"He came out, straight off his line,\" junior defender Cullen Pina said. \"Just blind courage. He threw his body in the way and got a huge piece of the ball.\" \nFor his part, Hodlofski contends he would have had to make 20 saves if it wasn't for his stellar backline, who consistently thwarted the Haverford attack. \n\"It has to be a team defense against a team that good with all the players they have,\" Pina said. \"It couldn't just be one person today and we all stuck together.\" \nBilly Coyle scored the eventual winner seven and a half minutes into the game, off an assist from Cullen Pina, who saw Coyle nodding for the ball. \n\"He played a great ball, it couldn't have been any better,\" Coyle said. \"I ran right on it and the keeper came out, and I just chipped it right over him.\" \nNarzikul and his teammates planned on attending Malvern Prep's homecoming dance Saturday night. \nIf any of their classmates happened to ask them how they did, the Friars will be more than happy to tell them. \nHaverford School 0 0 - 0 \nMalvern Prep 1 0 - 1 \nGoal: MP-Billy Coyle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:18:38.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
