More From KTVZ.COM Royals' Alcides Escobar wins ALCS MVP \nKlentak, who previously worked with Phillies president Andy MacPhail in Baltimore, will replace Ruben Amaro Jr., who held the position from 2008-15. \nAmaro was fired in September with the Phillies on the way to a major-league-worst 63-99 record and a second straight last-place finish in the National League East. \nKlentak was the Orioles' director of baseball operations in 2008 at the age of 27 while working under MacPhail. \nKlentak, 35, spent the last four seasons as an assistant general manager with the Los Angeles Angels. He interviewed for the Angels' recent GM vacancy, but the team hired Billy Eppler. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
