(AP) - The Mississippi Department of Human Services and Mississippi State University have been granted more than $1.9 million to help combat waste, fraud and abuse in the federal food benefit program.\nU.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, in a news release Friday, said the two entities will team up to develop and install an early detection and fraud management system to analyze patterns of fraud within the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nCochran says the grant is designed to help states deploy new technology to monitor and track investigations of individuals suspected of intentional program violations.\nIn addition to Mississippi, the U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded similar grants to Alaska, Maine, Nevada, and New Jersey.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
