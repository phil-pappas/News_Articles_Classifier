(AP) - A young Republican lawmaker is proposing legislation in New Hampshire to ban therapy aimed at changing the sexual orientation of minors, a move sure to cause friction within the GOP when lawmakers reconvene in January.\nRep. Eric Schleien (shline) says he doesn't think it's possible to change sexual orientation, and research has led him to believe trying to do so can be dangerous. But some fellow Republican lawmakers believe a ban could undermine religious liberty or parental rights.\nIf the 27-year-old's bill passes, New Hampshire would join California, New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois and Washington, D.C., in banning the practice known as conversion therapy.\nThe American Psychological Association and other health organizations say conversion therapy doesn't work and increases risks of suicide, depression and substance abuse among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teenagers.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
