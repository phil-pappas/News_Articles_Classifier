It was just a battle. We are just so happy right now. I can't put it into words.\"\nAsked how significant it was for the fans that the Cubs had finally clinched a postseason series at Wrigley Field, Rizzo replied: \"They deserve it. They deserve it. Hopefully this is just a taste of what's going to come.\n\"We're going to enjoy this. The whole city is going to enjoy this together, as we should. We just beat the best team in baseball. We're going to celebrate this and the city deserves this.\"\nThe Cardinals struck first when Stephen Piscotty, on his first pitch faced from starter Jason Hammel, blasted a two-run homer on a line drive to center field in the top of the first.\nHammel singled on a line drive to center field for Starlin Castro to score in the bottom of the second before shortstop Baez blasted a three-run homer over the right fence for the Cubs to lead 4-2.\nReliever Trevor Cahill came on for the Cubs in the sixth and began well before giving up a two-strike, two-out double to Tony Cruz as Jason Heyward scored to make it 4-3.\nBrandon Moss singled on a line drive for Jhonny Peralta to score and tie it up at 4-4 before the inning ended when Cruz was cut down at the plate on a superb throw from right fielder Jorge Soler.\nAgain, the Cubs' offense responded. Rizzo lined a homer to right in the sixth before burly rookie Schwarber powered a booming home run over the scoreboard in right field to put the Cubs ahead 6-4 in the seventh.\nCloser Hector Rondon, one of seven relief pitchers used by the Cubs in Game Four, replaced Pedro Strop to pitch in the ninth and sealed the win for the home team as the Wrigley Field fans erupted in celebration.\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:41:28.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
