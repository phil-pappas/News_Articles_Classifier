(Guide)", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "With all the hoopla over the 2016 elections, you might not realize Oregon has a special election next month: Nov. 3, 2015.\nIssues include a public-safety levy in Washington County, a gasoline tax in Troutdale, and a measure to build a new city hall and police station in Gladstone.\nElsewhere in the state, Coos County voters will decide on a \"Second Amendment Preservation Ordinance\" on gun rights. Grants Pass voters will give a thumbs up or down to a sales tax.\nBallots were mailed last week. They must be received -- not just postmarked -- by your county elections office by 8 p.m. Nov. 3 to be counted.\nHere's what's at stake in the Portland metro area and highlights of what will be decided in other parts of the state and region.\nMultnomah County\nGas tax: Troutdale is asking voters to approve a 3-cent-a-gallon gas tax , phased in over three years, to pay for street maintenance.\nSchool levy: Voters in the Riverdale School District will decide on a five-year local-option levy of $1.37 per $1,000 in assessed value to pay for operations. The tax would raise an estimated $690,000 the first year, 2016-17, and rise to $718,000 the last, 2020-21.\nWashington County\nPublic safety: The county seeks to renew a five-year public safety levy of 42 cents per $1,000 in assessed home value to provide money for prosecutions; jail, parole and probation services; a mental health response team; juvenile programs; a shelter for victims of domestic violence; and other services.\nLibrary: Washington County Library Services is seeking a five-year replacement levy of 22 cents per $1,000 in assessed home value to maintain and add library hours, buy books, pay for children's programs, and other services. The levy would raise an estimated $12.7 million the first year, 2016-17. That would rise to $15 million the last year, 2020-21.\nNew rec center: Tigard is asking voters to approve up to $34.5 million in bonds to build a community and recreation center. The measure would result in a tax of about 51 cents per $1,000 in assessed home value.\nRunning for office: Tigard voters will decide whether to change the city charter to allow City Council members to keep their seat while running for another office, such as Tigard mayor. Now, council members must resign to seek a new office if its term overlaps their council term.\nTerm limits: Voters in Tigard will decide whether to extend City Council term limits to 12 consecutive years, up from eight. That would lift the cap on overall City Council service -- as a councilor or mayor -- to 16 consecutive years. The term limit on the mayor's office would remain eight consecutive years.\nAnnexation: Sherwood voters are being asked to annex just under 102 acres on the city's south side. The area includes about a dozen parcels bounded by Ladd Hill Road, Brookman Road and Highway 99W.\nClackamas County New city buildings: Gladstone is seeking voter approval to sell $3 million in bonds and to combine the money with other funding sources to build a $7.2 million police station and a $4 million city hall.\nIndustrial development: Wilsonville voters will decide whether to form a Coffee Creek Urban Renewal District . The money generated would pay for infrastructure improvements to an industrial area projected to attract about 1,800 jobs.\nFirefighters: The Canby Fire District is seeking a five-year replacement levy of 45 cents per $1,000 in assessed value to retain four firefighter/paramedics and add two more during peak call times.\nSpending limits: Damascus asks voters to change the city charter on spending limits . Provisions include creating exceptions to the limit, and requiring a majority vote, not a unanimous one, for the City Council to increase the annual spending limit.\nCity Councils: West Linn voters will elect a City Council member , with Robert Martin, Casey Stroupe and Michael Selvaggio vying for one seat. Milwaukie will elect a City Council member ; Wilda Parks is running unopposed.\nSchool levy: Some Clackamas voters will also decide on the Riverdale School District levy (see above).\nElsewhere in Oregon\nCoos County gun rights: Coos County voters will cast ballots on a \"Second Amendment Preservation Ordinance\" that would declare void any law deemed to violate the Oregon or U.S. constitutions. It would also ban the use of county funds to enforce any law infringing on the right to bear arms, including registration requirements and limits on types of weapons or ammunition.\nGrants Pass sales tax: Voters will decide on a 2 percent sales tax to generate money for public-safety services, including providing at least 30 jail beds and reopening a juvenile justice center. The tax would replace a Jail Utility Fee property tax that, according to the measure, costs the average household about $277 a year.\nSalem transit: Salem-Keizer Transit is seeking a payroll tax of 0.21 percent per $100 to add weekend and holiday service, to expand evening service, and to add a youth pass program. The measure would raise about $5 million a year, according to the agency.\nBenton County jail: Benton County is seeking a $25 million bond to build a new jail for about 110 inmates and with about 20 work-release beds. The bonds would cost taxpayers an estimated 26 cents per $1,000 in assessed value.\nEugene library: Voters will decide on a five-year library levy to raise $13.5 million for expanded hours, purchases and programs . The levy would cost the typical taxpayer $36 a year, according to the measure.\nPendleton gas tax: The city is seeking a 10-year fuel tax of 5 cents a gallon to raise $550,000 a year toward street repairs and maintenance.\nWashington state\nSales of animal parts: A vote in Washington could offer a preview on an issue that could be on Oregon's statewide ballot in 2016: trafficking in endangered species' parts . If approved by voters, Washington will ban the sale of parts -- and products containing parts -- of elephants, rhinos, tigers, lions, leopards, sharks and other animals. The Humane Society of the United States launched an effort this month to put a similar measure on the Oregon ballot next fall.\nAnti-tax measure: Washington voters will also cast ballots on the latest measure from anti-tax crusader Tim Eyman . If passed, the measure would cut the state's sales tax from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent unless the Legislature sends voters a measure by April 15, 2016, to amend the state constitution. The amendment would require a public vote or a two-thirds super-majority vote in the Legislature to pass tax increases. The cut in the sales tax could cost the state $8 billion in revenue over six years.\n-- Michelle Brence\nmbrence@oregonian.com\n503-412-7059\n@mbrence", "external_links": ["http://www.clackamas.us/elections/documents/20151103/m3-468.pdf", "http://www.lanecounty.org/Departments/CAO/Operations/CountyClerk/elections/ElectionDocuments/CityofEugene_20-235.pdf", "http://www.co.washington.or.us/AssessmentTaxation/Elections/upload/Measure-34-242.pdf", "http://www.cherriots.org/ballotmeasure", "http://www.clackamas.us/elections/documents/20151103/m3-471vp.pdf", "http://www.co.coos.or.us/Portals/0/County%20Clerk/Elections/Election%202015/November%20Election/measure6-151.pdf?ver=2015-09-02-143631-447", "https://multco.us/file/46185/download", "http://www.co.washington.or.us/AssessmentTaxation/Elections/upload/Measure-34-239.pdf", "http://www.clackamas.us/elections/documents/20151103/m3-469vp.pdf", "http://www.clackamas.us/elections/documents/20151103/m3-470vp.pdf", "https://www.co.benton.or.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/elections_amp_passports/page/2903/2-91.pdf", "http://www.co.washington.or.us/AssessmentTaxation/Elections/upload/Measure-34-240.pdf", "https://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/MyVote/OnlineVotersGuide/Measures?countyCode=xx&electionId=58#ososTop", "http://www.co.washington.or.us/AssessmentTaxation/Elections/upload/Measure-34-235.pdf", "http://www.clackamas.us/elections/documents/20151103/milwaukie_position3vp.pdf", "http://www.co.washington.or.us/AssessmentTaxation/Elections/upload/Measure-34-241.pdf", "http://www.co.marion.or.us/CO/elections/Pages/November_3_2015-Special_Election.aspx", "http://www.co.washington.or.us/AssessmentTaxation/Elections/upload/Measure-34-236.pdf", "http://www.co.josephine.or.us/SIB/files/Clerk/Measure%2017_67.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:16:55.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
