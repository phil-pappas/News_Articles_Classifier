And for Bellemare to get time on the ice, and even make the roster in the first place, he was going to have to show the ability to do the things fourth-liners are supposed to be able to do in the NHL. That means being strong on the forecheck and solid in the defensive zone, among other things. What it doesn't mean is to expect anywhere near the 20 goals he scored in 52 games the previous season in Sweden.\nThe Flyers were so happy with the way he adapted to that role, they signed him to a two-year extension in March.\nMore coverage VOTE: Will the Flyers make the playoffs?

Latest hockey odds \"Obviously, it's a different level, and you need to progress in the role you have first,\" Bellemare said after Friday's practice. \"I have this role, and I'm enjoying it. You need everybody on a team to have a role and to accept the role the coach puts you in. For me, it's whatever it takes to be able to get some ice time. If that means dumping the puck on every single shift and going to hit the 'D,' I'm going to do that. If it helps the team, I'm going to do that.\"\nOn Wednesday in Boston, helping the team meant providing an early spark by putting the puck in the net. Bellemare and his fourth-line teammates, Chris VandeVelde and Ryan White, all chipped in on the goal to give the Flyers a 1-0 lead. White was strong on the forecheck, VandeVelde - providing support on the wall - got the puck behind the net and found Bellemare in front, who was denied once by Boston goalie Tuukka Rask before putting the rebound behind him.\n\"I think we were kind of well overdue with the amount of chances we're getting,\" said VandeVelde, who played under coach Dave Hakstol at the University of North Dakota. \"It feels good to finally get rewarded.\"\nThe trio has been an effective unit in all three zones. So good, in fact, when it came time to make decisions on healthy scratches from the lineup, Hakstol has put more skilled players such as Sam Gagner, R.J. Umberger and Vincent Lecavalier in the press box.\nIt helps, also, that Bellemare and VandeVelde are extremely effective on the penalty kill, but the line as a whole has a specific job that it's pretty good at. And as of right now, the three need not be split up.\n\"We've said all the way along, we need everybody to chip in, and I think everyone creates offense in different ways,\" Hakstol said. \"I think those guys, other than maybe one night, they've gone out and they've created some momentum and they've created scoring opportunities in their own way.\"\nHakstol has had the fourth line on the ice in high-pressure situations, such as late in games. It also has been tasked with starting shifts in the offensive zone, too.\n\"Everybody knows our situation. We're not the line that's going to score 50 points,\" Bellemare said. \"But everybody's got to have a role to make a team successful. So we have that role where we have to help the team in every little way that we can.\"\nTheir work hasn't gone unnoticed by upper management, either.\n\"People don't think about when the Bellemare line goes out and creates a bunch of energy, and all of the sudden, a lot of times, the (Claude) Giroux line will follow it up and score a goal,\" general manager Ron Hextall said. \"They don't think about the fact that the energy was created by 'Belle's' line there. It's a big part of any team.\"\nAnd it's obviously been a big part of this Flyers team through six games.\nSlap shots Sean Couturier remains day-to-day with an \"upper-body\" injury suffered Wednesday in Boston, when he was hit by former Flyers winger Zac Rinaldo . Couturier skated Friday, but general manager Ron Hextall said it was \"not probable\" that Couturier plays Saturday night against the Rangers . . . Backup goalie Michal Neuvirth skated and took a few shots in about 15 minutes of practice time. He remains day-to-day with an \"upper-body\" injury. It looks likely the Flyers will make a roster move and call up Phantoms goalie Jason LaBarbera to back up Steve Mason , though Hextall said they'll wait until Saturday morning and see how things are going . . . Brayden Schenn is expected to return to action Saturday night . . . It would appear Brandon Manning is likely to be the healthy scratch among the defensive unit . . . The Rangers (5-2-1) have beaten the Flyers in 14 of their last 19 matchups and come to Wells Fargo Center with a 2-0-1 record against Metropolitan Division opponents so far this season.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNHL_Philadelphia_Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:51:05.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
