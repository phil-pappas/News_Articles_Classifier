Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports In what undoubtedly will be seen as a controversial move, Texans owner Bob McNair donated $10,000 this week to a group advocating against LGBT rights.\nAdChoices The donation comes at a time when the NFL has been publicly promoting acceptance of gay players, particularly after Michael Sam, the league's first openly gay player, was drafted last year.\nMcNair's contribution went to The Campaign for Houston, a group that is opposing a proposition called Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO). The ordinance would prohibit discrimination in the city based on race, gender, sexual orientation, age and a number of other factors.\nA Campaign for Houston spokesman, Jared Woodfill, confirmed the donation Friday.\n\"We're very excited,\" Woodfill said. \"Obviously it speaks volumes to the support we have if a hero like McNair is contributing to our campaign.\"\nThe group has called the proposed ordinance \"an attack on the traditional family.\" Proposition 1 goes to a vote Nov. 3.\nThe 78-year-old McNair has been the Texans' owner since their inception and has an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:56:01.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
