The Bengals had driven from their own 18 after getting the ball back with 2:17 left and no timeouts remaining. \nAdam Jones appeared to bust a punt return after the defense got the stop that got the Bengals the ball back, but he was ruled to have made an invalid fair catch signal, which wiped out the return as the whistle blew in the middle of it and set the Bengals back to their own 18. \nThe Bengals had pulled within 24-14 a little less than three minutes into the fourth quarter when Andy Dalton hit tight Tyler Eifert with a 10-yard touchdown pass, his second TD reception of the game. It was set up when Jones returned a Seahawks punt 35 yards to the Seattle 33. \nThey got within 24-21 with 3:38 left after driving 71 yards in six plays and getting a five-yard sneak by Dalton for a touchdown. \nAfter the Bengals took a 7-0 lead on their first possession of the game, Seattle scored the next 24 points. \nThe Bengals (4-1) rolled up 152 yards in the first quarter, but were held to just 64 over the next two quarters when they were outscored 17-0. \nDalton finished 30 of 44 for 331 yards. He was intercepted once and sacked four times. Dalton was attempting to become the first quarterback since the new passer rating was adopted in 1973 to begin a season with five straight games with a passer rating of 115.0 or higher, but after finishing the first quarter with a 152.1 rating he finished the game with a 95.9 rating. \nSeattle (3-2), which won its third straight game after an 0-2 start to the season, got touchdowns four plays apart midway through the third quarter to break away from a 10-7 halftime lead. \nThe first of the two came when running back Thomas Rawls ripped off a 69-yard touchdown run to put Seattle up 17-7 with 8:38 left in the third quarter. Safety Reggie Nelson had a chance to tackle Rawls around the Bengals 25, but tried to chop down on the ball and knock it out instead, which allowed Rawls to run the rest of the way for the score. \nRawls, an undrafted rookie free agent from Central Michigan, started in place of injured standout Marshawn Lynch, who was declared out on Friday due to injury. Rawls finished with 169 yards rushing on 23 carries. \nFour plays after Rawls' touchdown, Bengals running back Rex Burkhead fumbled while attempting to run a \"jet sweep,\" to the right. The ball was scooped up by Seattle middle linebacker Bobby Wagner, who returned it 23 yards for a touchdown to put the Seahawks up 24-7. Defensive end Michael Bennett caused the fumble when he came unblocked and hit Burkhead just as he took the handoff. \nSeattle put together a good opening drive of the second half when it drove from its 19 to the Bengals 16 on the first drive of the second half, but Russell Wilson's pass into the middle of the field intended for tight end Jimmy Graham was tipped by middle linebacker Rey Maualuga high into the air and cornerback Adam Jones intercepted at the Seattle 2. \nThe Seahawks did increase the lead to 17-7 the next time they got the ball when running back Thomas Rawls ripped off a 69-yard touchdown run. Safety Reggie Nelson had a chance to tackled him around the Bengals 25, but tried to chop down on the ball and knock it instead, which allowed Rawls to run the rest of the way for the score. \nThe Bengals trailed 10-7 at halftime thanks to having a 72-yard Dalton to A.J. Green touchdown pass wiped out by a holding a penalty on Andrew Whitworth and Dalton getting intercepted in the end zone in the final minute of the half. \nThe Bengals took a 7-0 lead by driving 86 yards in seven plays on their first possession of the game, capping it with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Dalton to Eifert, who was wide open on the play. \nEifert had eight receptions for 90 yards in the game. \nIt marked the fourth time in five games this season that the Bengals scored a touchdown on their opening drive of the game, and was the first defensive touchdown Seattle allowed since its second game of the season. The Seahawks didn't allow a touchdown in 20 possessions over their last two games. \nDalton accounted for all 86 yards on the opening drive, going 4 of 4 for 80 yards passing, including a 42-yard catch-and-run by wide receiver Marvin Jones, and had a six-yard run. \nSeattle answered by driving 80 yards in eight plays on its first possession capped by a 30-yard touchdown pass from Wilson to wide receiver Jermaine Kearse, who was wide open on the play in right corner of the end zone. Cornerback Dre Kirkaptrick was seen screaming at linebacker Emmanuel Lamur after the play. \nIt marked the first defensive touchdown the Bengals allowed in the first half this season. \nThree plays into the next Bengals series, Dalton hit Green with a 72-yard touchdown pass, but it was called by back by the holding penalty on Whitworth. Green easily beat cornerback Cary Williams on the play and then side-stepped safety Earl Thomas around the Seattle before taking it into the end zone. If the play had stood, Dalton would have opened the game going 6 for 6 for 174 yards in the game's first 11 minutes. \nNeither team did much offensively after that until the Bengals took over on their own 32 with 8:02 left in the half and drove to the Seahawks 21 where on third-and-10 Dalton stared dared Green in the right front corner of the end zone and Thomas stepped in front to intercept it. That marked Seattle's first interception of the season. \nThe Seahawks used the final 54 seconds of the half to drive from their 18 to the Bengals 6 and got a 24-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka as time expired in the half to put them up 10-7. Wilson completed 5 of 6 passes for 76 yards on the drive. \nSeattle wound up outgaining the Bengals in the first half 195-189. Dalton finished the half 13 of 19 for 165 yards, while the Bengals had just 31 yards rushing on 12 carries. \nWilson was 9 of 11 for 126 yards and running back Thomas Rawls rushed for 53 yards on nine carries in place of injured standout Marshawn Lynch. \nWilson finished 15 of 23 for 213 yards and was sacked four times. \nNOTEWORTHY: Jones had a first-half sack on a play in which he didn't blitz, but chased down Wilson as he scrambled instead. ... Defensive end Carlos Dunlap recorded a second-half sack as did defensive tackle Geno Atkins . ... Bengals defensive lineman Wallace Gilberry , who missed practice Wednesday and Thursday and was limited on Friday due to a calf injury, was active for Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks, while defensive tackle Pat Sims is the lone surprise among the team's seven inactives. Gilberry was listed as questionable on the official NFL injury report that was released on Friday. Also made inactive for Sunday's game were: wide receivers Mario Alford and Greg Little ; tight end C.J. Uzomah ; cornerback Chris Lewis-Harris ; rookie defensive tackle Marcus Hardison and defensive end Margus Hunt . ... The Seahawks made the following players inactive for Sunday's game: cornerback Tye Smith ; running back Marshawn Lynch ; cornerback Marcus Burley ; linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis ; offensive lineman Kristjan Sokoli ; offensive lineman Alvin Bailey and defensive end Demarcus Dobbs. \nPhoto: Tony Tribble for Local12 \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
