She also recorded eight assists, tying her for tops on the team with junior Miranda Nimmer. \nMiller senior Eva Raczkowski recorded a team-high 12 digs. \nMILLER NOTES \nThe triumph, Millburn's second of the season over its Super Essex Conference, Colonial Division rival, was the squad's third in a row after its campaign-opening 10-match winning streak came to an end Oct. 9 with a 2-0 loss to host Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School. \nThe Millers entered this week's action with an 12-0 record in Colonial Division play, good for a one-game lead over Columbia High School (11-1) with two division matches left, including a contest set for Thursday, Oct. 22, at 4:30 p.m. at Columbia in Maplewood. \nEmail: connellyj@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:13:34.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
