For both teams, it's not just one half of the ledger against the other, but both sides working in tandem.\n\"We want to win. That's the No. 1 thing I talk about with the guys, so they understand it,\" Harsin said. \"They're all very smart when it comes to the key ingredient when it comes to be a successful football team — it's turnovers. I think that's showed up in the games, and when you can go back and point it out and go, 'OK, here's why we won the game, because we had this many turnovers, we didn't give up any and we scored every time we got one,' for example. If we continue that, we can win.\"\nWhile the Broncos are tied for eighth in the country in turnover margin, the Rams are near the bottom (121st). Boise State is plus-8 in the category, having turned the ball over five times while collecting 13. As the season has extended, the Broncos are only getting better as new quarterback Brett Rypien has yet to throw an interception.\nColorado State is the opposite, creating just five this season while giving away 14, including an astounding eight fumbles. Defensively, it has gone three games this season without creating a turnover.\nThe Rams head into the contest knowing every yard may count, but tight end Kivon Cartwright said every ball carrier has to be mindful of the team they're facing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:49:35.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
