Liverpool have recent history with the FA over treatment of players. \nJust over a year ago, Klopp's predecessor Brendan Rodgers expressed his displeasure after Daniel Sturridge sustained a thigh injury during an England training session, the day after an international match. \nKlopp said: \"Rossiter is a special story. I never heard of an 18-year-old playing three games in five days. That's why he is injured and I don't think he will be ready until the next international break. \n\"I don't know who I have to talk about this, but I will find a way because it's not OK. On my first day, I didn't want to have a call with someone with the FA but, for sure, this is not OK. \n\"These young players are our future, if we handle them like horses we get horses.\" \nAs if to emphasise the point, Klopp insists he is not a slave to the 100 per cent, flat-out running dogma which people associate with his football as he is just as concerned about players' fitness. \nThe German's methods from his first match in charge at Tottenham - in which the Reds ran a combined 116 kilometres, by far their furthest of the season - have been the subject of much analysis. \nThere is already a debate about whether his team will be able to sustain that in a Premier League season when there are also European demands. \nBut Klopp stressed it was not the necessarily the requirement every game, saying: \"The biggest misunderstanding in my life is people ask me if it is possible to play this kind of football. \n\"We don't have to run 115km only to be successful. We need healthy players but we don't kill the players.You don't have to run like crazy if you have the ball. It's only the start. \n\"We must know turn the screws in the right moment - better thinking, better timing. But if play a much better team and you are not ready to run more than them, then you are crazy.\" \nKlopp is likely to make changes to his side for the Europa League visit of Russians Rubin Kazan tonight. \nHe's holding back the likes of striker Sturridge, who sat out the draw at White Hart Lane with a knee problem, for Sunday's visit of Southampton. \nHe added: \"Rotation is OK if your players can handle the situation. You can leave a few players out on the pitch and the others have to swim for their lives, which is not OK. \n\"We cannot bring (Christian) Benteke and (Roberto) Firmino back for starting, for example. If all the players are fit and you have been working for a while, then you can think about it.\" More on this story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:28:03.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
