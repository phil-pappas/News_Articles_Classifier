The permits will be issued to Deal residents only.\nThe timing of the ordinance has raised questions among beach access advocates as a nearly $40 million beach replenishment project that has put tons of sand on Deal beaches nears completion.\nWhile there are beach access points in the borough, the concern is that there will be no place to park for those wishing to use the expanded beaches, paid for with taxpayer money.\nOne of the stipulations for funding the project was that it be available for use by the public and access be provided. If there is no place to park, it will make accessing the new, bigger beaches difficult.\n“They’re not saying you’re not getting access,” Joe Pallotto, president of the Asbury Park Fishing Club, said. “You can walk from Asbury and get on the beach.”\nThe problem is that the parking will be for residents only, he said, and if people can’t park there, they can’t get to the beach.\n“It’s totally ridiculous. Why should my tax dollars pay for a big beach behind somebody’s house that you can’t access,” Pallotto said. “It’s unfair.”\nPallotto said he’s hoping to bring a big group of people to hear arguments on the ordinance this Friday, Oct. 9, at 9 a.m at the Borough Hall. Borough Hall is located 190 Norwood Ave. in Deal.\nJohn Weber, Mid Atlantic regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation is also asking interested parties to turn out for the meeting and he is optimistic they won’t vote it into law.\n“Towns have a right to restrict parking in their own streets. It’s just questionable when it’s right next to $40 million beach replenishment project.” Weber said.\nWeber, who has been involved in the public access issue for years, said a number of federal documents associated with the replenishment project clearly state that the lack of sufficient public parking with reasonable public access to the beach will preclude federal participation.\nAs the project is nearly done, and the federal government has fully participated, it appears it’s time for the towns to follow suit.\nTuna Stakes Invitational\nThe Tuna Stakes Invitational, which was postponed by the wind and rain of the past weekend's nor'easter and the threat from Hurricane Joaquin, has been rescheduled.\nTournament Director Len Strobel said the Captain's Meeting will take place tonight, Oct. 6, from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Reel Seat in Brielle, located at 707 Union Ave. (Route 71) in Brielle. The 10 days of tournament fishing will begin on Wednesday.\nFor tournament updates, visit www.tunastakesinvitational.com.\nJohn Oswald: joswald@GannettNJ.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:04:02.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
