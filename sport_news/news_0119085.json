Photo: Getty Images\nIt just keeps getting tougher for Jarryd Hayne on his NFL journey.\nWith his gleaming pre-season performances a thing of the past, Hayne is quickly learning the regular season is a different - and far more difficult - beast.\nThere is no more going up against back-ups and those trying to make an NFL roster, opposition defences are now filled with stars.\nNot only is Hayne, and all other offensive players for that matter, now going up against the pick of the league's defensive backs, line backers and secondary units, they are also facing teams who have spent a whole week devising schemes to stop what their opposition is good at.\nAdvertisement You simply don't encounter that level of scrutiny during the pre-season. There, teams worry solely about themselves, and they are far too smart to unveil any new schemes against their opponents. That stuff is saved for when it matters.\nHere's a breakdown of what Hayne and the 49ers will face when they meet Arizona Cardinals at the University of Phoenix Stadium on Sunday (6.05am, Monday, AEST):\nWhat next for Hayne â€‹ ?\nAfter getting just four touches in last week's hammering at the hands of Pittsburgh , Hayne's work at training this week had better be sharp.\nWith No.1 running back Carlos Hyde tipped to play despite suffering a thigh injury last week and his primary back-up Reggie Bush a chance to return after missing the Steelers match with a calf injury, Hayne is likely to return to a predominantly special-teams role if he makes the 46-man active roster on game day.\nQuestions about whether he will make the 46 may become a weekly issue when the 49ers have everyone on deck.\nWide-receiver and kick returner Bruce Ellington, who has looked the goods in limited opportunities, may also return after missing last week.\nWe also can't forget rookie running back Mike Davis. Davis had seven rushes (for a modest return of 14 yards) against the Steelers. While he hardly set the world on fire, he did get more game time than the former NRL star.\nIf Hayne is one of the game-day inactive players, there is no need to lose heart. What can't be forgotten is that he is still very much on a learning curve. He is a long way ahead of where most thought he would be at this stage of his NFL development.\nWhat about the 49ers?\nAfter a strong home win under the Monday-night lights to start the season, the Niners could not have hit the ground any harder last weekend.\nThe Steelers turned in a dominant first half (29-3 lead) before cruising to an easy win. Their defensive backs and line-backing corp handled the 49ers offence with relative ease.\nAs for the 49ers defence - which looked very sharp against the Vikings in week one - the less said the better. Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger and star wide receiver Antonio Brown enjoyed themselves at San Francisco's expense.\nA look at the Arizona Cardinals\nThese guys are good. So good in fact that they are given a great chance of winning the NFC West - the division that includes the 49ers, St Louis Rams and a Seattle Seahawks side that won Super Bowl XLVIII and were a goal-line interception away from making it two in a row.\nThey also started the new season with two wins - a 31-19 home win over New Orleans and a 48-23 mauling of the Bears at Soldier Field in Chicago last week.\nTheir defence is packed with big names - Calais Campbell, LaMarr Woodley, Patrick Peterson and Tyrann Mathieu - and an offence that looks great whenever oft-injured quarterback Carson Palmer is upright.", "external_links": ["http://www.steelers.com/videos/videos/HIGHLIGHT-Antonio-Brown-blows-by-49ers/90977c54-16ad-4e65-b384-75dce22c1b79"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:02:16.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
