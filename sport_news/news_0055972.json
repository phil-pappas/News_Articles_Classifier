Her response to it landed her a spot in the girls state championship tournament. \nThompson, a junior, was the top finisher Monday at the Zone 5 (Valley) qualifier at Heritage Oaks Golf Course in Harrisonburg to earn one of three berths for the two-day VHSL girls championship in Virginia Beach. She carded a 2-over-par 74 to take the top spot in a field of 11 golfers vying for three state berths. \nJoining Thompson from Zone 5 are Spotswood freshman Jaden Harman, who also had a 74, and East Rockingham junior Meranda Ludholtz, who finished with a 78. The state tournament gets underway Oct. 26 at Red Wing Lake Golf Course in Virginia Beach. \nThompson has been one of the most consistent golfers in the area all season. However, it took one poor round — a 96 at the Conference 36 tournament at Spotswood Country Club on Sept. 28 — to change her approach to her game. \n\"I was used to not playing so much, but scoring well,\" she said. \"I have five advanced classes (in school), so I don't have a lot of free time. But I wasn't using the time I had very well, so I knew I had to change things to do better.\" \nThe hard work on her game helped her improve and made the difference Monday at Heritage Oaks. \n\"It was just a combination of everything working,\" she said. \"I've been playing well for the last couple of months and everything came together (Monday).\" \nThompson earned her berth at the qualifier because of her top-15 finish at the Group 2A East tournament on Oct. 6. There were a total of eight girls zone qualifiers, with the top 20 percent finishers in each tournament earning berths for the state championship. \n\"It's a blessing,\" Thompson said of making the state championship, which begins on her birthday. \"It's an opportunity a lot of people haven't had.\" 3 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/2015/10/20/gaps-thompson-qualifies-girls-state-golf/74264364/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:25:07.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
