With their win, the Lady Cavaliers moved to 2-0-0 in the league and 5-0-1 overall. \nIn a very fast-paced and hotly-contested game, both teams battled for every loose ball. It was Harvey that found the net first, scoring two goals in the first half. Senior Aila Prieto battled for a loose ball and followed her shot to the goal, burying her own rebound to open up the scoring. \nMinutes later, freshman Morgan Chapman scored when she blasted the free kick past the Chase netkeeper who got only a piece of the shot. \nMidway through the second half, Harvey had a defensive breakdown that allowed Chase’s top striker room to work. Her shot cut the Harvey lead in half. \nHarvey’s defense recovered quickly and shut Chase down for the rest of the game. Harvey goalie Kelly McMorrow was outstanding, making 10 saves. \nHarvey Coach Greg Janos liked what he saw from his offense. \n“We continued to put the offensive pressure on Chase, keeping them on their heels and denying them any opportunity to tie the game,” he said. \nSenior midfielder Julia Frisch was named hardest worker for her efforts on defense and offense. \n“Julia was just outstanding for us,” said the coach. \nJanos described the game as a “battle and a great effort by both teams.” \nHe added, “I’m happy we could put another check in the win column.” \nThe Cavs host EF International on Friday.
