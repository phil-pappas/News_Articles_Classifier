Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) stock, while reiterating its Buy rating. Here’s Why Merrill Lynch Reiterated Its Buy Rating On Yahoo! Inc (YHOO) Despite Weak Guidance YHOO CBN discusses the reasons behind Merrill Lynch’s decision to reduce its target price on Yahoo stock, while reiterating its Buy rating \nYahoo! Inc. ( NASDAQ:YHOO ) stock was reiterated as Buy at Merrill Lynch, while the target price was lowered to $46 from $48 in its latest sell side report. The company has experienced a surprise decline in the search revenues for third quarter (3QFY2015), which has seen revenues miss street target, while Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) slightly edge up the estimates. However, the prospective Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ( NYSE:BABA ) spin off has kept the overall positive lid on the current developments. \nMerrill Lynch suggests that Yahoo’s commitment to Alibaba spin-off is likely to be a positive catalyst in the 4QFY2015, as well as 1Q2016. The bank thinks that if Yahoo was to receive a favorable 0% tax treatment, then the stock would have $44 upside price and if on the other hand, a full tax rate of 38% was applied to the spin off, then there would be a $33 downside. However, the sell-side firm believes that Yahoo is likely to benefit from the Chinese e-commerce titan’s by-product, which predicts a 10-30% discount to be incorporated into Yahoo stock due to Alibaba’s full value as a result of tax and liquidity uncertainty. Therefore, a target price of $46 has been set, keeping in mind a 20% discount on Alibaba and the positive valuation of 12 months consensus price for BABA stock at $96. \nThe Price target of $46 is based on the firm’s sum-of-parts valuation approach. The $42.34 estimated asset value represents $31.11 per share from the rest of Alibaba stake using $96 Alibaba valuation from the bank’s own analyst. The valuation comprises of (9% discount rate, mid-term Free Cash Flow for years 2017-2, Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 22%, and a 4% terminal growth) x 384mn shares at 20% discount rate), $5.31 from Yahoo Japan, and $5.92 in cash and cash equivalents on Yahoo's balance sheet. Merrill Lynch assumes $4.06 per share in value from core business, using 6.0 multiple on Yahoo EBITDA to reflect no growth in 2015E and 2016E. \nThe positives from 3QFY2015 for Yahoo include a potential spin-off of Alibaba, which is expected in 4QFY2015 or January 2016, search partnership with Google for search ads and stable display trends according to Merrill Lynch. On the other hand, the negatives for the third quarter are 4Q revenue/EBITDA guidance lower than the street estimate and a miss in search revenue by 13% year-over-year (YoY) standing at $390 million, despite the addition of Mozilla. \nSignificant risks to the Yahoo target price of $46 by the sell-side firm include a possible decline in Alibaba stock valuation , the degree of taxability of Alibaba spin off, another large acquisition in the short term by Yahoo, as well as a fall in Japan valuation.The bank has lowered the 4QFY2015 revenue/EBITDA guidance due to a constant pressure faced by Yahoo’s core display and search network. the firm has cut down the 2016 revenue to $3.6 billion from $3.91 billion with a below street EBITDA for 2016 slashed to $640 million from $781 million. The net impact on bank’s valuation by deploying a 6x multiple on the lower 2016 EBITDA is $1 per share. \nThe target price for Yahoo has been lowered to $46 by Merrill Lynch in the wake of a lower core value of the company, as well as a reduction in Alibaba target price to $96 from $100. The important stock catalysts, according to the bank, are Alibaba stock price performance in 3Q2015, street perception about tax prospects relating to Alibaba spin-off, street perception about Yahoo’s use of cash for future acquisitions, and the core business’ outlook for the US company. \nCBN opines that Yahoo is under persistent pressure in its core search business. Therefore , the importance of a successful Alibaba spin-off has increased even more. In the face of struggling 3QFY2015 results, it is imperative that Yahoo facilitates the proper spin-off for Alibaba and that it addresses the search revenue decline prudently. We reckon that Yahoo has the potential of recovery if the Alibaba spin-off goes smoothly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:24:37.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
