The point after made the score 7-0. \nCentennial responded with a drive that ended with a seven-yard Wyatt Ehlers run. Tom Fischer made the point after to tie the score at 7-7 with 3:45 to go in the quarter. \nFillmore Central added a 24-yard field goal with 1:17 to play in the half to take a 10-7 lead into halftime. \nCentennial took the lead with 7:20 to play in the third on an 18-yard pass from Ehlers to Reece Foreman. Fischer’s kick put CHS up 14-10. \nRyan Schlueter added the game’s final touchdown on a 41-yard run with 4:36 to go in the game. The PAT failed, leaving the score 20-10. \nKlanecky said the Broncos made “a ton of adjustments” in the locker room, most of which worked. He said Centennial ran better in the second half, which allowed the defense to wear the Panthers down. \nCHS also improved its pass protection. \n“We hit some running plays early, and that allowed us to open the playbook again,” Klanecky said. \nSchlueter led the offense with 190 yards on 22 carries. Ehlers completed eight of 16 pass attempts for 153 yards. Brayden Obermier was his favorite target. The senior caught three passes for 90 yards. \nOn defense, Obermier finished with four solo tackles and two assists. Adrian Turrubiates had four solo stops and six assists. \nIn the win, the Broncos lost starting cornerback Caden Eberspacher, who broke his arm, Klanecky said. \nCentennial (3-2) heads down Highway 34 Friday, Oct. 2, to play Malcolm in a district game. \n“They are very similar to us,” Klanecky said. “Offensively, it’s eerie how similar we are.” \nBecause the teams are so much alike, he said it’s easy to prepare. \n“It’s usually a battle of execution,” he said. “We both know what we will get.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:44:30.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
