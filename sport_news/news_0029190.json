(AP Photo/Alastair Grant) more > By JEROME PUGMIRE   \nCARDIFF, Wales (AP) - The All Blacks delivered the most brutal of reminders to anyone doubting their ability to defend the Rugby World Cup title, scoring nine tries against France on Saturday in a quarterfinal record 62-13 thrashing. \nLeft winger Julian Savea crossed for a hat-trick of tries as New Zealand surpassed the previous record winning margin in a World Cup quarterfinal, set by South Africa in 1995 with a 42-14 win over Samoa. \n“We’re going to enjoy tonight, we’ve earned the right,” New Zealand coach Steve Hansen said. “We have to acknowledge to ourselves that it was special.” \nNew Zealand will play a semifinal next weekend against South Africa and, on this form, will be a hot favorite. \nThe All Blacks were questioned repeatedly this week about if they were scarred by the corresponding quarterfinal at Millennium Stadium eight years ago, when New Zealand was beaten 20-18 by France at the same stage, on the same ground. \nThis time, the French were 29-13 down at the break and it just got worse for them. \nAll Blacks captain Richie McCaw said losses to France in 2007 and in the 1999 semifinals had been consigned to the past. \n“You realize that the intensity of a quarterfinal is up a level and we knew that without having to think back too far,” he said. “It’s another step, but we haven’t done anything yet - all we’ve done is earn another week.” \nFour years ago, France pushed New Zealand all the way in the final before losing 8-7 in Auckland. There was no stirring comeback this time. \n“There were two or even three levels of difference between the sides,” France captain Thierry Dusautoir said. “After such a defeat, after the helplessness we felt for most of the game, there’s not much left to say.” \nBeleaguered Philippe Saint-Andre, who is standing down after four years as France coach, was quick to credit Hansen’s team. \n“You have to show dignity in defeat, you have to congratulate New Zealand,” he said, comparing the All Blacks with the great Brazilian soccer teams. “They are the Brazilians of rugby.” \nBy the end of this match, the All Blacks were chasing their own record margin against the French: which was a 61-10 defeat in 2007. \nIt should have happened, but center Ma’a Nonu fumbled the ball as he crossed the line minutes from fulltime. \nHe could afford to laugh it off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:24:53.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
