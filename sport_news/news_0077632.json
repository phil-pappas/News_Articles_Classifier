By Kevin Haskin kevin.haskin@cjonline.com \nLAWRENCE — Various impressions are forming — and they will become more acute after additional football is played on Saturday — that the coaching position at Kansas is ... \nA) Immensely challenging. \nB) Increasingly unmanageable. \nC) Downright impossible. \nEvery day, David Beaty must dismiss those bleak definitions and vow that none of the above apply. He will have to do so on Saturday, coaching against No. 3 Baylor, a full-throttle rival capable of hanging a hundred, especially since it will carry a limited number of players on its traveling roster. \nA tough job for Beaty gets even tougher. \nEver since he accepted the task, the KU coach has not deviated from his inner self, which is wired with positivity. Even when there have to be times when every electrode that connects to his brain tells Beaty the football program at KU cannot be fixed. \nThe most recent reminder was provided numerically. \nThe Big 12 team the Jayhawks defeated by 20 points to avoid the conference cellar last season just delivered a 38-13 setback to the squad Beaty coaches. Kansas, in all likelihood, will gain membership renewal into the Big 12 basement because of that loss at Iowa State. \nWith every defeat, an extra layer of gloom clouds any prospect of recovery. \nInjuries mount, leaving the Jayhawks to start a freshman quarterback behind inadequate blockers. Defenders crowd the box to take away a running back, Ke’aun Kinner, who was a bright spot in the first two games. Receivers have difficulty gaining separation. All those issues limit the development of the up-tempo offense Beaty devised to be help the Jayhawks join the ranks of the Big 12’s cool kids. \nAnd that’s just one phase. Defensively, KU is even worse. In fact, the Jayhawks could “break” two long-standing defensive records this weekend: points allowed (71, in a 1987 loss to Oklahoma) and yards allowed (799, in a 1978 loss to Nebraska). \nMeanwhile, fans skip games. Revenue needed for upgrades at the football complex is lost. In terms of facilities, KU is falling further behind, even with a complex that was constructed not all that long ago. \nWas Beaty the right hire? The question gets asked more frequently with every defeat. \nYet this particular fallout, in year one, was precisely what everyone anticipated. \nExperience, depth and talent were all down. Enough that the Jayhawks could go winless. That was the level of expectation, and the fact it has not yet changed is not a definitive knock on the young coach Kansas appointed into his first head coaching job. \nExamples exist that the Jayhawks can win at football. \nThey are less than a decade removed from an Orange Bowl run. \nTheir athletic director, Sheahon Zenger, was on the ground floor of the toughest transformation in college football history — the reclamation project orchestrated by Bill Snyder at Kansas State. \nFinally, the opposing sideline Saturday will be occupied by Baylor, which for years was the league doormat, yet now could contend for a national title as the two-time defending Big 12 champion. \nWhy, this week, Beaty was asked if any KU player stacked up to the talent possessed by Baylor. \nBeaty almost sounded as if he agreed with that assessment before applying the company line he is left to fall back on. \n“You know what, we’ve got to keep working and keep earning it,” he said, “and I think some of our guys got a chance to develop too. The more experience they get, I think the better they’re going to get.” \nThey better in order to confront what is, yes, a challenging situation. \nUnmanageable? At times. \nImpossible? No. \nA turnaround requires attentive coaches willing to correct inexperienced mistakes they have already committed in regard to both personnel moves and play-calling. That staff must adopt principles, some of them on the fly, then commit to them. It must remain dedicated to detail, a quality that becomes more difficult as the losing streak escalates. \nDo that, and strides are possible — small at times, significant later on, depending on the effect the Jayhawks’ latest coach provides. \nThe only way things get worse for KU football is if Beaty fails miserably. To avoid that, he must never let a naysayer convince him that D) All of the above, applies to the aforementioned impressions. \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:57:43.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
