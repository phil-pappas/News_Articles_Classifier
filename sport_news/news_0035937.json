I can assure all football fans. Even Der Spiegel did not offer any proof.\"\nBeckenbauer has not responded to repeated requests for comment from Reuters. His agent could not be reached on Saturday.\nEarlier on Saturday another former member of the 2006 organising committee, Fedor Radmann, also rejected the allegations.\n\"The bid committee never bribed anyone,\" Radmann told Sky Sports News in Germany. \"I am prepared to say that under oath. We bought no vote.\"\nThe DFB said on Friday its own investigation had found no wrongdoing in the process of being awarded the 2006 World Cup, but said it was investigating a payment of 6.7 million euros ($7.6 million) from the committee to FIFA for a cultural programme during the 2006 World Cup and whether it was used as intended.\nDer Spiegel claimed this payment was a return of a loan paid to the bid committee by the late Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus to help it set up the alleged slush fund, a claim also rejected by Niersbach.\nFIFA was plunged into the biggest crisis of its 111-year history in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted in the United States on bribery, money laundering and wire fraud charges involving more than $150 million in payments\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:58:46.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
