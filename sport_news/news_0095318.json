Stacy Long , Montgomery Advertiser 7:38 a.m. CDT October 16, 2015 Troy University's Brandon Burks (32) is stopped by New Mexico State's Lewis Hill (29) at Veterans Memorial Stadium in Troy, Ala. on Saturday October 11, 2014. (Photo: Mickey Welsh) \nLine: Troy by 121/2 (as of Tuesday) \nRecords: Troy (1-4, 0-1 Sun Belt), Idaho (1-4, 0-2) \nOn the air: TV — none; Radio — WTXK-FM 107.5, WTXK-AM 1210, WACQ-FM 101.1, WACQ-AM 580, WTBF-FM 94.7 \nTwitter: @AStacyLong, @MGMsports \nFOUR-DOWN TERRITORY \n1. Flipping out: Troy freshman receiver Deondre Douglas, besides making a quick impact with the Trojans, has another skill he readily displays. He’s adept at back flips. “I do a lot of stuff like that,” Douglas said. “It stretches me a lot and keeps me loose.” Douglas, who made six catches and had a lengthy kickoff return in last week’s 45-17 loss at Mississippi State, said he started flipping when he was 14 years old. Blame an older brother. “I was one of those kids who was a daredevil,” Douglas said. “Whatever my brother did, I said I could do it, too.” Douglas said not to look for him to flip after he scores his first career touchdown, whenever that may be. “I want it to count,” he said. Douglas, who didn’t sign with Troy until the NCAA Clearinghouse OK’d his grades in July, said he hopes any success he’s had is just a start. “I feel I can do a lot more,” he said. “I started off kind of slow, but I’m getting the hang of things.” Troy receiver Deondre Douglas talks about his talent for backflips. Stacy Long \n2. Run and fun: When Troy running back Brandon Burks missed last year’s Idaho game with an injury, Jordan Chunn ran for a career-high 189 yards. This year, Chunn has been out with a broken collarbone, though he may return this week. Gear up, Burks. “I don’t go out there and think about yards,” Burks said. “Whatever happens, happens, but I feel like I’ll have a big game against them. When everybody comes ready to play, I feel we’ll do well against them.” Troy running back Brandon Burks is looking for a big game against Idaho after his backup, Jordan Chunn, ran for 189 yards last year against the Vandals. Stacy Long \n3. Moving around: Troy offensive lineman Johnathan Boring, in his first year as a starter, has tried every position on the line. Recruited as a center, he went to right tackle, then left tackle, back to center and, this spring, was at guard. In August, offensive line coach Matt Moore stuck Boring back at left tackle. He’s started every game. “Wherever I’m needed or anybody else is needed,” Boring said. “Some of it has been because of injuries. Some of it has been because of other kind of stuff like that. But I think we’re good where we are right now.” Boring is also the backup center and the Trojans have several lineman listed at two spots on the depth chart. “I rotate them, but it’s the same guys,” Moore said. “That’s just where we’re at right now until we get another year of recruiting under our belt.” Troy offensive tackle Johnathan Boring says the Trojans have made steady improvement on the offensive line this year. Stacy Long \n4. OK with Pruitt: If starting quarterback Brandon Silvers doesn’t play due to last week’s injury at Mississippi State, the Trojans say they’re confident in backup Dontreal Pruitt. The senior was 12-of-17 passing for 90 yards and ran for 56 yards and a touchdown. “I was pleased with how he came in and performed, and I think in a tough situation because our backup quarterbacks don’t get a ton of reps in practice,” coach Neal Brown said. “He’ll play better with more practice. He’ll get some more practice reps this week and I think we’ll be fine.” Troy coach Neal Brown said the Trojans did put quarterback Brandon Silvers through their concussion protocols. Stacy Long \nPLAYERS OF THE WEEK \nJosh Marshall/Jalen Harris \nCB, 5-11, 183, Jr./CB, 6-0, 182, So. \nSomebody has (to try) to cover Idaho receiver Dezmon Epps, who has 42 catches for 528 yards and two touchdowns in his four games. Epps ranks third in Division I in catches per game and fifth in receiving yards per game. \nBY THE NUMBERS \n37-15-1: Troy’s record on homecoming after last year’s victory over New Mexico State. \n18-4-1: Troy’s homecoming record under former coach Larry Blakeney, including three straight losses from 2010-12. \n47: Points per game allowed by the Idaho Vandals. \n124: Where the Vandals rank in scoring defense in the 127-team NCAA Division I-A rankings. \n4: Sun Belt teams in the final four spots. \n542.6: Yards per game allowed by the Idaho Vandals to rank 120th. \n3-25: Coach Paul Petrino’s record at Idaho. He’s in his third season. \nPREDICTION \nIn two previous games against Idaho, Troy had a running back go for 184 yards (DeWhitt Betterson in 2004) and 189 (Jordan Chunn in 2014). Does senior Brandon Burks have enough in him to make a run at the 200-yard plateau? Unlikely. Troy 39, Idaho 26.
