What better opening than watching Kash Daniel and Paintsville take on Pike County Central in the Apple Bowl with Coach Stoops in attendance? This edition of the annual game was controlled by Daniel and Kent Phelps. Daniel scored once and Phelps scored on three rushing touchdowns to lead Paintsville to a 56-7 win over Pike County Central. \nOn offense, Kent Phelps stole the show for Paintsville. The junior running back scored three first half touchdowns including a 73-yard TD to put the Tigers on the board in the first quarter. Phelps’ also returned a kick for a touchdown only to have it called back on a penalty. Daniel added a ten yard touchdown in the second quarter to put the Tigers in front 29-7 at the half. Luke Trimble scored in the second half on a long run and Paintsville put the running clock in motion during the third quarter with a 36-point lead. The Tigers would score two more touchdowns to wrap up a 56-7 win. \nWatching Kash play is truly a spectacle on defense. He flies to the ball and can get east to west in a hurry. I didn’t fully understand just how quick he is on defense. It seemed Kash was in on every play and flew to wherever the ball was. Kash kills a kid on an option and he his done for the night as the running clock is put in place. \n— Trey Huntsman (@TreyHuntsmanKSR) October 2, 2015 \"I'll take whatever role.

The junior is extremely talented and one of the fastest players I’ve seen in person this season. Phelps does a great job of staying north to south and keeping his eyes down the field. He scored three times on Thursday night to boast his total to 13 in only five full games. Phelps will be one of the top players to watch in 2016 as a senior. \nThere was a great vibe in Paintsville tonight. Maybe it was the attendance of Coach Stoops , D.J Elliot, and myself (two more than the other). Maybe it was Kash. Might have been the Apple Fest being in town. Whatever it was, the game atmosphere was fantastic. There was a line of people to talk to Stoops at halftime. He talked to every person and obviously made a big impact on the people in attendance and on the community.

Kash is going to play early at UK. KT October 2, 2015 at 12:05 pm | Permalink | Reply \nPretty sure Stoops will have you doing more than playing waterboy Kash. Love the attitude though. Go Cats.

It might be what they call it, but Paintsville is afraid of playing Johnson Central in the actual apple bowl even with Kash. Central even offered to play this year.
