NHL has players worth watching 1  /  6 Back to Gallery Alex Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby have won five of the last nine Hart Trophies and are the only active players to win multiple MVP awards.\nTeam success, though, has been elusive for both lately and for Ovechkin throughout his career.\nThe Ovechkin-led Capitals haven't made it past the second round of the playoffs. Pittsburgh is coming off a first-round exit, its third in five years, and the Penguins haven't come close to contending for a Stanley Cup since hoisting it in 2009.\nSoon after free agency opened, the Capitals acquired winger T.J. Oshie from St. Louis for Troy Brouwer, a prospect and a pick. The Penguins picked up winger Phil Kessel from Toronto in a six-player trade.\nHere are some players to watch when the NHL drops the puck for the regular season this week:\nJack Eichel : Buffalo will not have a boring hockey team anymore, and the No. 2 pick overall, an 18-year-old center, has a lot to do with that.\nOshie: Ovechkin can't win in the playoffs by himself. Oshie might be just the kind of player he needs on the team's top line.\nKessel: Sid the Kid is not old, but at 28, he's not young in professional sports. After concussions and a broken jaw limited him the previous three years. Crosby scored 28 goals last season, his lowest total in a relatively healthy season, but Kessel's presence should help him score and set up teammates more.\nPatrick Kane : The Chicago Blackhawks have stuck by their superstar while a criminal investigation into a sexual assault allegation against him continues. Kane insisted he did \"nothing wrong\" on the night in question.\nSteven Stamkos : The 25-year-old center is due for a big raise after averaging nearly 40 goals during his first seven seasons in the NHL. If that huge boost in pay is not happening in Tampa Bay, it's easy to see him returning to play near his hometown for Toronto.\nCarey Price : The Montreal goaltender became the first to win the Hart and Vezina Trophies along with the Lindsay Award since Dominik Hasek pulled off the trifecta in 1998 with Buffalo.\nHenrik Lundqvist : He missed 24 games last season with a strained blood vessel in his neck before bouncing back to play in the postseason. The Rangers are counting on him because they traded a capable backup, Cam Talbot, to Edmonton and acquired a goalie with less experience, Antti Raanta, from Chicago.\nJaromir Jagr : Yes, he's still playing in the NHL. The 43-year-old signed a one-year deal with Florida, which liked enough of what it saw after acquiring him from New Jersey last season to bring him back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:29:28.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
