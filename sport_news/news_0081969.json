Some hunters try to cheat system with faked racks Posted: October 9, 2015 - 10:40pm Photos FACEBOOK PHOTOGRAPH Antler addiction might be causing some people to go to extremes for their five minutes of fame. This deer, reportedly taken in North Carolina by a bowhunter, was later found to have a rack from a Pennsylvania deer screwed to its skull plate. Had it been legitimate, it would have been a new state record, but the ruse was quickly uncovered. By Marc Murrell mmoutdoors@cox.net \nDeer hunters love the thrill of the chase. Some are concerned with nothing more than tasty venison for the freezer. \nHowever, many are after a buck with a huge, hat-rack set of antlers. A growing industry of deer hunting-related products has boomed, and the quest for the biggest rack continues in nearly every state across the country. \nBut does this fascination of big deer racks come at a cost, or cause people to try to cheat the system? Absolutely. \nThe most recent example is a deer allegedly taken in North Carolina with a huge nontypical rack. It had 27 points and would have been the state’s newest nontypical record. It was reportedly taken by a hunter named Nick Davis using archery equipment. It measured 223/18 inches gross and 2082/8 inches net, according to Joey Thompson, an official scorer for the NC Bowhunters Association who measured the rack. \nHowever, photos of the deer created a lot of skepticism. The antlers appeared too white and too big to come from a deer of that size. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission interviewed Davis, and Thompson later said officials discovered the rack was actually from Pennsylvania and screwed on to the skull plate of a 3-pointer that Davis had killed with a rifle. \n“To everyone in the NC woods, I am in regret to inform you that a deer I took pride in measuring is not a NC deer,” the measurer wrote on Facebook. “I am very upset over this as I felt it was legitimate and legal. I am very thankful (to) the NCWRC for the hard work and for protecting the deer we hunt. I want to apologize for the hunters of NC for the problems we face as we spend numerous hours away from our loved ones in pursuit of the big deer we chase. I’m in shock and I’m sorry for misinforming NC of a potential state record.” \nBut as everyone that keeps any tabs on the some of the country’s biggest bucks knows, this isn’t the first time someone has been caught trying to cheat the system for fame and possibly fortune. \n“There’s a lot of criticism in the hunting world today about people being completely engrossed by the score of an animal,” said Justin Spring, assistant director of big game records for the Boone and Crockett Club. “And that’s basically the problem, as they’re missing the whole point of why we keep records, and that’s to gauge wildlife.” \nSpring said he thinks people try to cheat because they put too much emphasis on a number and a rank. \n“I don’t know if it’s jealousy or what may be the driving factor, but being the ones that keep these records, our whole point is conservation — not recognizing a hunter’s prowess by an overall ranking — and I think people lose sight of why we do what we do.” \nLying about a particular deer and where it was taken is nothing new. Spring couldn’t think of any specific examples from Kansas but says they’re seeing other cases that end up as fraudulent. \n“The biggest thing we’ve been seeing lately is farm deer that people are trying to pass off as legitimately taken and then not necessarily from the same areas,” Spring said. “The deer are tagged, they’re lip tattooed, so usually we end up finding out about it as people have pictures of them behind a fence.” \nOther examples Spring mentioned, without mentioning names, were mule deer racks that people had purchased that may have been decades old and then tried to pass them off as hunter-killed. \nThese types of fraudulent claims give hunting and hunters a bad name. Unfortunately, it might also be cause to add fuel to an out-of-control fire for an otherwise totally legitimate accomplishment. \n“Any time a high-scoring, high-ranking trophy is taken, that jealousy comes into play,” Spring said. “If you shoot something that’s very top-end, bigger than the area usually produces, you’re going to have those things accused of you. I don’t know why people are so hung up and you should be proud of another hunter experiencing amazing success. \n“Wildlife conservation put that deer there and then someone else was fortunate enough to come across it and that should be the celebration.” \nHunters should be proud of their accomplishments should they take a huge, record-book animal. However, they shouldn’t lose sight of the overall accomplishments of wildlife conservation and give due credit to the animal itself. \nFortunately, these bogus claims often come to light, particularly in today’s social media world. But when it does, obviously for the same reasons social media helps expose them, it also spreads like wildfire. The good news is they’re not happening with enough regularity that it’s becoming commonplace. \n“We have 46,000 entries in our records book,” Spring said. “And I can count on one, maybe two hands the people that have tried to cheat. It’s not the majority of people, it’s a very small few.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:49:08.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
