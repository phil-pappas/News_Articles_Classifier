Leonard Fournette, running back, LSU\n2. Trevone Boykin, quarterback, Texas Christian\n3. Ezekiel Elliott, running back, Ohio State\nHow I see it:  How I see it: Can we please get to November? Individual performances are beginning to blur. The Heisman is won by producing in November. Well, that’s most seasons. I still say give Fournette the trophy already. Nobody has his combination of power and speed. His 1,202 rushing yards not only lead the nation, they’re 205 more yards than the next best in Oregon’s Royce Freeman. Boykin continues to pile up ridiculous numbers, and he’s also a good dude. Before last week’s win at Iowa State, he squatted down to say hello to Abby Faber, a 7-year-old with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, who was in her wheelchair by the field. A photo of the moment went viral. We need more of this and none of the death threats aimed at poor Michigan punter Blake O’Neill from keyboard cowards. Elliott rambles on in third place with yet another 100-yard game. Zeke, however, might want to keep an eye on Christian McCaffrey of Stanford, who ran for 243 yards and four touchdowns in a 56-35 win over UCLA. And he didn’t play in the fourth quarter. The sophomore running back totaled 369 all-purpose yards, including a 96-yard kickoff return. There is still time for McCaffrey to move up. November beckons.\n>> Get the most out of college football season, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nBill Rabinowitz, OSU football beat writer 1. Leonard Fournette, running back, LSU\n2.  Trevone Boykin, quarterback, Texas Christian\n3. Ezekiel Elliott, running back, Ohio State\nHow I see it: Fournette faced a real defense last week against Florida and showed why he’s the front-runner. He ran for 180 yards and two touchdowns in 31 carries. For the season, he has 1,202 yards. Boykin just keeps rolling along, and given the award’s slant to quarterbacks, his candidacy can’t be dismissed. He had 510 yards of total offense against Iowa State and accounted for five touchdowns. Elliott will need to pick up the pace statistically if he’s to make a serious run at the Heisman, but anyone who watches his total game -- blocking, pass-catching, etc. -- knows that he’s among the best players in college football.\n>> Predict Ohio State vs. Rutgers, plus other games \nTim May, OSU football beat writer 1.  Leonard Fournette, running back, LSU\n2.   Ezekiel Elliott, running back, Ohio State\n3.  Trevone Boykin, quarterback, Texas Christian\nHow I see it:  My top three didn’t change from last week, but my \"under serious consideration\" list did. The conundrum in that regard is what’s going on with Baylor. Does one credit quarterback Seth Russell for the ridiculous offensive production and make him the Heisman candidate, or does one consider that without the prodigious numbers from receiver Corey Coleman, Russell might just be another fellow out there slinging it? Coleman has 16 touchdown catches through six games, which means he is on track to shatter the major-college record of 27 set by Louisiana Tech’s Troy Edwards in 1998. That’s hard to ignore, so we’ll watch as the Bears’ (defensive) competition ramps up the last half of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:58:17.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
