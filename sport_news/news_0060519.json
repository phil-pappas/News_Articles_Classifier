Campbell, the Dolphins interim head coach after the firing of Joe Philbin, has encouraged his team to \"violently compete\" at practice, and that seemed to translate into a successful game plan. The Dolphins offense incorporated a very impressive running game into their matchup with the Titans, after struggling in that area all season, rushing for a season high 132 yards in the first half, and finishing with 180 yards on the ground for the game. Lamar Miller highlighted the ground game with a season high 19 carries for 113 yards and a touchdown. The running game started on the first drive which was capped off with a 22 yard touchdown run from Jarvis Landry for the Dolphins first 1st half lead of the season. Dion Simms added a touchdown catch in the 4th quarter to cap off a 9 play, 97 yard drive that began with a Brent Grimes interception. Jordan Cameron the capped off the day with his first touchdown of the season. The Dolphins defense seems to have figured themselves out too, playing their first game under defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, who replaced Kevin Coyle just days after head coach Joe Philbin was fired. Cameran Wake pulled off his first four sacks of the season against Titans' rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota, while Reshad Jones ran in a 30 Yard touchdown interception in the second half.
