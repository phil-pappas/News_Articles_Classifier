Smith, Ark.) in a heavyweight scrap. \n“I’ve seen him (Favela) fight several times,” said Rouse. “Eric is very experienced. He’ll have a weight advantage (205 pounds). We’ve got to get Matt to 195 pounds. Right now, Matt is at the top of his game. He had a great outing back in June.” \nA pair of Bartlesville brothers, Zeph Jacobs and Solomon Jacobs, are scheduled Saturday for their first fights, Rouse said. \nBrandon Boyd, another local product, is set to crawl inbetween the ropes and follow up on his win earlier this year. Boyd will be taking on “a really tough opponent, Owasso’s Mike Browning,” in a super middleweight encounter, Rouse said. \nAnother promising pairing pits Jared Williams against Isaac Johnson. \n“I think Jared will win, but it will be a good, competitive fight,” Rouse said. \nSparks may fly in a welterweight meeting between Mike Hoover and Tulsa’s Michael Kelso. \n“It looks like a full-out brawl for the distance,” Rouse said. “I think that’s going to be one of the best scraps of the night.” \nRouse also has high hopes for the lightweight battle between experienced Joe McCormick and Missouri’s David Guardado. \n“I know for sure it’s going to be an awesome fight,” Rouse said. \nThe Jackson-Favela blow-swapper and Lewis-Marino heavyweight tussle should be the final two offerings of the evening. \nThis might be the only time Lewis — who also plays pro football — fights locally, Rouse noted. \n“It’s been a rough road,” to get him in the ring, Rouse said. “He’s back and forth with contracts with football. … We’re pretty blessed to have him in Bartlesville. This fight has the possibility for people telling their grandkids they were there. I think this fight is going to be a war.” \nVeteran trainer Ike Stafford has been working in a Springfield, Mo., gym with Marino, who hails from Columbia, Rouse noted. \n“Ike doesn’t get excited about fighters, but he’s excited about this guy,” Rouse said. “The truth be known, he (Marino) will probably be a more skilled fighter then what Ronnell is at this point. But, he’s (Lewis) a beast. He’s breaking things in the gym.” \nRouse said Lewis’ trainer Craig Blacklock has “told me Ronnell is not a fluid fighter yet, but he said it doesn’t matter. All he’s got to do is hit anything and it’s over. I know it’s going to be blinding power by Ronnell. It s going to get down Saturday to who’s the best warrior.” \nThe fight show is set to begin at 8 p.m. and Rouse said he plans to run the bouts quickly through and try to be wrapped up by 10 p.m. \nThe fairgrounds are located in Dewey, just south of the Dewey High School football field.
