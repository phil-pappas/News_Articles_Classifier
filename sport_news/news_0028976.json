Image 11 of 11 Coons' FG in OT gives Browns 33-30 win over Ravens 1 / 11 Back to Gallery BALTIMORE (AP) â€” Josh McCown bucked recent history and put his name in the Cleveland record book with a marvelous performance that extended into overtime. Travis Coons kicked a 32-yard field goal in the extra season, McCown threw for a team-record 457 yards and the Browns notched a stunning 33-30 victory over the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. Cleveland (2-3) had lost 13 of the previous 14 meetings between these AFC North foes, but in this one the Browns rallied from a 12-point deficit to leave the Ravens (1-4) alone in the division cellar. Baltimore never before has been 1-4, and this marks the first time the Ravens lost their first two games at home. Playing its second straight overtime game, Baltimore went three-and-out on the first possession of the extra session. McCown then used more than seven minutes to move the Browns 51 yards before Coons kicked his fourth field goal of the game with 6:43 left in OT. McCown completed 36 of 51 passes with two touchdowns in becoming the first quarterback in Browns history with three straight 300-yard games. He broke the team record of 444 yards passing set by Brian Sipe on Oct. 25, 1981, against the Baltimore Colts . Joe Flacco ran for two 1-yard touchdowns and threw for a score, but fell to 13-2 against Cleveland. Baltimore went up 27-22 on a 1-yard run by Justin Forsett with 5:56 left, but as has been the case in virtually every one of their defeats this season, the Ravens couldn't come up with the big play in the fourth quarter. McCown connected with Isaiah Crowell on a 22-yard touchdown pass with 3:03 remaining, and the 2-point conversion left the Ravens needing a field goal to tie. A personal foul against Donte Whitner on a third-and-6 incompletion led to a 32-yard pass from Flacco to Forsett, who appeared to hurt his right ankle on the play. He did not return and finished with 121 yards rushing. After Forsett left, three plays inside the 10 failed to get the ball into the end zone. That left Justin Tucker to kick a 23-yard field goal with 25 seconds left in regulation. Overtime belonged to the Browns after a wild fourth quarter. Down 21-9, the Browns rallied behind McCown to take a 22-21 lead with 12:23 remaining. First, he directed a 13-play, 75-yard drive that was extended by a hands-to-the-face penalty call against Jason Babin on a third-down incompletion from the Baltimore 15. Two plays later, McCown ran in from the 10. After a Baltimore punt, McCown needed only four plays to cover 79 yards and give Cleveland its first lead. After a 56-yard completion to Andrew Hawkins , McCown lofted a pass toward the end zone that tight end Gary Barnidge and safety Will Hill each had an equal chance to catch. The ball glanced off Burnidge's left leg and rolled down to his left ankle as he pinned his legs together to control it. While on his back, he reached down and secured the ball for an 18-yard touchdown. It turned out to be merely the opening salvo of a wild fourth quarter. The Ravens led 14-9 at halftime despite gaining only 34 yards on the ground against the league's second-worst run defense. ___ AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Southeast Texas sports news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:11:44.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
