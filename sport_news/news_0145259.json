Yeldon on a tackle. He hasn't practiced or played since. \nStill, the Panthers (3-0) are managing OK so far without the 2013 NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Carolina has a bye next week, so Kuechly will have had four weeks off to rest. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
