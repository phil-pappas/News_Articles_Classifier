Watt will play for Mid Canterbury in the Heartland Championship rugby semifinal in Ashburton on Saturday. \nCanterbury boxer Sam Watt has won his second national heavyweight title and is now itching to fight Commonwealth Games champion David Nyika to boost his Rio Olympic Games hopes. \nWatt, a backrower in the Mid Canterbury squad for Saturday's Heartland Championship rugby semifinal against Wanganui, is frustrated that the much-anticipated clash with Nikau has yet to take place. \nThe Ashburton accountant was also annoyed that Boxing New Zealand took his number one ranking away from him and gave it to Nyika, who has moved up to the heavyweight (91kg) class after winning the 81kg light heavyweight title at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. \nNow, Watt, 23, is seeking sponsorship and funding to give him a shot at making March's Asia Oceania Championships in China, the qualifying tournament for the Olympic Games. \n\"I'm keen to give myself the best opportunity to get to Rio next year. You don't want to wonder all your life whether you could have made it, or not.\" \nThat would include a bout with Nyika. \n\"We had a bit of a problem with that this year, mostly caused by the fact his coach and my coach don't get on too well.\" \nThere was also a stand-off over the venue. Watt felt, as national champion, it should be on his turf, either in Christchurch, where he was raised, Ashburton where he now works and lives, or Timaru, where he was born. Ad Feedback \n\"It would be the biggest fight of my life and I wanted it to be in front of my family and friends.\" He comes from a sporting Christchurch family. His younger brother, Jackson Watt, is a Junior Black Sox softball representative and a lock in the Christchurch Boy's High School first XV. \nWatt, who beat Glasgow Commonwealth Games heavyweight silver medallist David Light in last year's New Zealand final, said Nyika was \"pretty adamant\" their match should be held in his hometown, Hamilton. \nA solution will have to be reached in 2016 if the two fighters remain in the same weight division. \nGoing up to superheavyweight (over 91kg) class is an option for Watt, but he said he likes it where he is. \nThe Papanui Boxing Club fighter, who is trained by veteran coach Mike Pimley, is still disappointed that Boxing New Zealand decided to give Nyika the No 1 heavyweight ranking this year, despite Watt holding the national title. \nNyika went to the world championships in Doha last week as a heavyweight, losing in the first round.\"What really should happen now is there should be some ranking tournament early next year, in February [before the Asia Oceania championships],\" Watt said. \"Obviously, there are some fighters who were in the youth division, who are now in the elites, who should get the opportunity to challenge for rankings.\" \nWatt said it was \"a bit of a juggling act\", combining boxing with club and representative rugby, as well as sitting a chartered accountancy paper. But he is enjoying every minute of it. \n\"But it's getting pretty expensive with all the travelling to Christchurch and back. The petrol bills get pretty big, which is why I'm pursuing that sponsorship or funding.\" \nHe said it was satisfying beating Waikato's Frank Masoe on a unanimous points decision to retain the Dewar Shield national heavyweight title at last weekend's national boxing championship final in Invercargill.\" \n\"David Tua's name is on that shield four times and now I'm on there twice; that's pretty cool.\" \nHe hopes to continue boxing and playing rugby as long as he can and would love to help Mid Canterbury, the Heartland Champions, make another final by beating Wanganui in Ashburton on Saturday. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:56:37.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
