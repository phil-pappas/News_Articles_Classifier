He completed 20-of-33 passes and threw five TD passes, while rushing for one more score in the victory. \nIt was the second game in Baylor history in which a QB had 300-plus passing yards and 100-plus rushing yards, joining Robert Griffin III’s game against Kansas in 2011 (312 pass/103 rush). Russell's career-high 160 rushing yards were the second-most by a quarterback (RG3 had 217 vs. Washington State in 2008). \nWith Russell’s help the Bears continue to lead the NCAA with 719.7 yards of offense per game and 63.8 points per contest. BU is the only team in the country averaging over eight yards per play, gaining 8.94 yards a snap. \nIndividually, Russell leads the FBS in passing efficiency (210.0), passing TDs (27), passing yards per completion (18.51), points responsible for per game (32.0) and passing yards per attempt (11.70). The junior from Garland, Texas, is 12th in passing yards per game (317.8) and his total offensive output of 374.2 yards per game is sixth-best nationally. \nRussell is the fourth Baylor player to earn Walter Camp National Player of the Week honors since 2004. He joins former BU quarterbacks Griffin III (Sept. 4 and Nov. 20, 2011) and Bryce Petty (Oct. 12, 2014) as honorees.Russell has also helped Baylor rise to a program-best ranking of No. 2 in both the AP Top 25 and the Amway Coaches Poll. With Russell at the helm, the Bears are 6-0 for the third-straight year – a program first – and 3-0 in conference play for a third-straight year as well. \nLast week, Russell was added to the Manning Award watch list, after having been placed on the Maxwell and Campbell Tyler Rose award watch lists prior to the season. \nThis is the 12 th year that the Walter Camp Football Foundation is honoring one offensive and one defensive player as its national Football Bowl Subdivision player of the week during the regular season. Recipients are selected by a panel of national media members and administered by the Foundation. \nBaylor will now host Iowa State at McLane Stadium at 11 a.m. Saturday for Homecoming. That game will be nationally televised by ESPN.
