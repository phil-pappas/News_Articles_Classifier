(Photo by Alan Warren for the Messenger-Inquirer) \nTwo very familiar foes will play for the 3rd Region boys' soccer championship. \nOwensboro High School had a mighty struggle but got the winning score in the 77th minute and escaped Muhlenberg County 2-1 in a semifinal game Tuesday night at Panther Field at Deer Park. \nThe other semifinal was considerably less dramatic. Isaac Amaya put together a hat trick over a four-minute span to lead Daviess County to a 10-0 win over Meade County in 53 minutes. \nDaviess County and OHS meet for the fourth time this season at 7:30 p.m. at Panther Field. \nOwensboro 2, Muhlenberg County 1 \nNick Brake drove left side and appeared to put a shot through Muhlenberg County keeper Cole Fogle's legs with three minutes left in regulation. \nBrake scored in the 48th minute to tie the game 1-1 when he got a ball on the end line and Fogle couldn't handle the ball. \n\"We put all kind of pressure on their goal, we just couldn't finish,\" OHS coach Dale Poole said. \"Nick Brake's goals were real heads up plays.\" \nOwensboro (12-6-3) took 18 shots. Skylar Lovett in goal for OHS and its defensive back line kept Muhlenberg County's Dan Marigny fairly under control. \nMarigny had the assist on a counter-attack goal by Nick Neal in the 28th minute to push Muhlenberg County in front. \n\"They gave a lot of energy, a lot of effort, it was the best record we've ever had in Muhlenberg County,\" Muhlenberg County coach Grant Sharp said. \nMuhlenberg County finished 17-5-1. \nDaviess County 10, Meade County 0 \nAmaya scored his goals in the 24th, 28th and 29th minutes for DC (21-2-2). Amaya scored his first off really fine pass from freshman Brian Winkler, which was the second assist by Winkler, to give DC a 4-0 lead. \nAmaya's second goal came off a double assist by Ryan Freer and Tommy Booker. Amaya's third goal came a minute later for the hat trick. \n\"Overall we played pretty well, we had some nice passing, side to side, we were able to connect a lot, pass around and get behind them,\" Amaya said. \"We ended the game with 27 minutes left. We were pretty focused on finishing out the game. \nGraham Miller and Ryan Freer each scored two goals. Josef Winkler, Tyler Boling and Nolan Mattingly also scored for DC. \nHunter Baird, Mattingly, Brian Winkler, Jackson Connor and Amaya had assists. \n\"They played a very high line against us, we were able to get behind them and get a lot of balls into the box from that,\" DC coach Doug Sandifer said. \"We finished well tonight.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:27:59.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
