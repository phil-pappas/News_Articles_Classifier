Some of his Big Ten colleagues might start thinking Ferentz is on to something. The downside to social media again became apparent over the weekend. Michigan athletic director Jim Hackett released an open letter on Sunday urging fans to avoid “thoughtless comments” following Michigan State’s stunning 27-23 win over the Wolverines. Much of negative online chatter focused on Michigan punter Blake O’Neill, whose fumble led to the game-winning touchdown for the Spartans. Michigan State head coach Mark Dantonio says he’s disappointed with those who bashed O’Neill, adding that one play shouldn’t define a person. Golf Woods wisely being patient with latest recovery MEXICO CITY – Tiger Woods is facing what he calls a long and tedious recovery from another back surgery and is not sure when he will come back. Woods was in Mexico City on Tuesday for the Bridgestone America’s Golf Cup, an exhibition he was supposed to play with Matt Kuchar. That was before he announced a second back surgery after his doctor discovered a fragmented disc that was pinching a nerve. He had surgery a month ago. Woods already has said he won’t be able to play his Hero World Challenge the first week of December in the Bahamas. Poulter gets late entry to keep European membership HONG KONG – Ian Poulter scrambledto get to Hong Kong to save his European Tour membership, and perhaps his chances of playing the Ryder Cup next year. And he owes it all to former PGA champion Rich Beem. Andy Sullivan and Emiliano Grillo winning tournaments last week bumped Poulter out of the top 50 in the world and made him ineligible for the HSBC Champions in Shanghai in two weeks. Poulter was counting on that event to reach the minimum 13 tournaments required to keep his European Tour membership. Only tour members can play for Europe in the Ryder Cup. It was too late to enter the Hong Kong Open, and all the invitations were taken. Beem offered to give his exemption to Poulter. NFL Former Oklahoma QB ready for Steelers start PITTSBURGH – Landry Jones had his first regular-season NFL action last week. Now, it looks as if he will make his first start this week. Head coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that his team will prepare for Sunday’s game against at Kansas City as if Jones will be the starting quarterback. Starter Ben Roethlisberger has been out since spraining the medical collateral ligament in his left knee Sept. 27 in a win over the Rams at St. Louis. Backup Mike Vick suffered a strained right hamstring in last Sunday’s 25-13 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. Olympics USA chairman looking toward future hoops coach An NBA coach will likely follow Mike Krzyzewski as U.S. Olympic basketball head coach. USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said Tuesday the “odds are that it will be a professional coach.” Krzyzewski was hired as U.S. coach in 2005 when Colangelo began the national team program and will guide the Americans into the Olympics for the third consecutive time next summer in Rio. Colangelo says he hopes to unveil his plan to replace him sometime soon. The Americans had only been led by NBA coaches once pro players were allowed to be used starting with the 1992 Olympics.
