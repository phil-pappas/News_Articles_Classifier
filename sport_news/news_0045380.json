Electing to bat, Jharkhand kept losing wickets at regular interval as Jadeja wreaked havoc, taking six wickets for 71, while Kamlesh Makvana (4/46) also chipped in with four scalps. \n\nOpener Ishan Kishan top scored with 87 but only three other batsmen could reach the double-digit mark. Replying to Jharkhand's total, Saurashtra also did not have a good start and they also failed to apply themselves. But thanks to Jadeja's 75-ball 58, the home team managed to take a slight edge over their opponents. \n\nFor Jharkhand, Shahbaz Nadeem claimed four for 38. \n\nBrief scores \n\nJharkhand 1st innings: 168 all out (Ishan Kishan 87, Ravindra Jadeja 6/71, Kamlesh Makvana 4/46). \n\nSaurashtra 1st innings: 205 all out (Ravindra Jadeja 58, Cheteshwar Pujara 27; Shahbaz Nadeem 4/38)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:19:39.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
