However their scrum then lost another key component as captain Agustin Creevy hobbled off after 30 minutes. \nDespite their early heroics, Sanchez was turned over after a risky half-break from his own 22, and the Wallabies punished the Pumas. \nFolau almost powered clear, before Matt Giteau floated a beautiful pass out to Ashley-Cooper, who slid home for his second try and the Wallabies' third. \nStill Argentina pressed, Sanchez landing his third penalty of the half, before Cordero shredded the Wallabies' line to race close. However, Hernandez could not find full-back Joaquin Tuculet when halted just shy of the line, and Australia escaped to the break 19-9 up. \nFoley missed a regulation penalty at the start of the second half before Argentina's attacking lynchpin Juan Martin Hernandez limped off the field. \nArgentina then bulldozed Australia off their own scrum again, forcing a penalty that Sanchez landed with ease before Foley responded with a penalty of his own. \nArgentina punted one kickable penalty to touch, then won another penalty from the lineout before Sanchez opted to take the three points. \nWith just a converted try between the teams Argentina continued to press, refusing to be broken by either their slow start or the Wallabies' stubbornness. \nHowever, Australia's ferocious defence stood up to another test. \nAnd after soaking up so much pressure across the course of the half, from a blindside lineout break the Wallabies struck. \nDrew Mitchell exploited half a yard on the left wing to scoot through the line before scything in off the flank. \nMitchell evaded four cover tackles before flinging a desperate pass out to the right flank. Somehow the ball bobbled backwards and Ashley-Cooper scooped up and scooted home for his hat-trick score - the try that killed off the Pumas' resistance. \nThe Pumas battled on, throwing the ball about and attacking with skill, verve and excitement, but ultimately fell short of the line. \nAustralia now roll on into the final, where they will aim to dethrone defending champions the All Blacks in a clash between the two best sides in the competition, while Argentina face South Africa in a battle for third place.
