(AP Photo/David Goldman) \nCANADIAN CLUBBING \nToronto tries to draw closer in the AL Championship Series, facing an 0-2 deficit vs. the visiting Royals. Johnny Cueto starts for Kansas City against Marcus Stroman at 8:07 p.m. EDT in a matchup of pitchers who last threw in Game 5 of the Division Series. The Blue Jays were the top-slugging team in the majors this season, but didn't hit a single home run in their two losses at KC. They're hoping that the ball will fly with the roof closed at Rogers Centre. \nTAKE IT EASY Chicago Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta watches as New York Mets' Daniel Murphy rounds the bases after hitting a two-run home run during the first inning of Game 2 of the National League baseball championship series Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in New York.
