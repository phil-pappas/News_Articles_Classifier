(AP) - The New Hampshire Department of Transportation says the new Exit 3 southbound off-ramp of the Spaulding Turnpike in Newington is set to open.\nThe ramp is scheduled to open on Friday, a day later than previously announced. It will allow traffic to exit and head east across a new bridge to get to Woodbury Avenue and the malls.\nThe old left exit ramp was closed on July 7 while the new ramp, bridge and additional tie-in roadwork were under construction.\nRestrictions will remain in place until later this fall on other Exit 3 ramps.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
