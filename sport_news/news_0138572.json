Swiss authorities on Friday approved extradition of FIFA defendant Costas Takkas, held in that country since his May 27 arrest in the multi-pronged FIFA corruption scandal that has brought down leaders of international soccer.\nTakkas, a British citizen, has 30 days to appeal the decision by the Federal Office of Justice or else he will be shipped to New York to enter a plea at the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.\nAn inside player in lucrative soccer-tournament broadcast deals, Takkas stands accused of trafficking in bribes in a scheme involving CONCACAF, the regional soccer federation formerly based in the Trump Tower in New York.\nOLYMPICS CHIEF: FIFA CAN'T BE FIXED WITH JUST NEW PRESIDENT\nThree of Takkas's co-defendants have entered not-guilty pleas in Brooklyn , while the other 10 remain abroad pending extradition from Trinidad, Switzerland, and Argentina. A status conference in the case originally scheduled for Friday has been postponed to Nov. 18. The Swiss have their own criminal investigation open.\n\"By accepting bribes for the award of sports marketing contracts, Takkas massively influenced the competitive situation and distorted the market for media rights in connection with the World Cup qualifying matches,\" the Swiss Federal Office of Justice (FOJ) said in a statement issued on Friday.\nTakkas was an official in the Cayman Islands Football Association, where he became a close associate of Jeffrey Webb — a CIFA official who rose to become president of CONCACAF — who entered a not-guilty plea this summer. Takkas was an \"attache\" to Webb and dealt frequently with Webb's sidekick, Enrique Sanz, who is described in the grand jury indictment as \"Co-conspirator #4.\"\nView Gallery Sports scandals throughout history\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nThe grand jury indictment alleges that Takkas told Sanz that Webb wanted a $3 million bribe in exchange for an agreement to steer a contract toward Traffic USA, a sports marketing company in Florida where Sanz worked. The indictment says Takkas ran two personal holding companies that were used in alleged schemes -- one registered in the British Virgin Islands, another registered in the Cayman Islands.\nCONCACAF, which oversees soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean, was for decades based in the Trump Tower in New York, but has since been relocated to Miami. The organization, a non-profit, falls under FIFA's organizational umbrella.CONCACAF has been central to the FBI and IRS investigation that has led to the global leadership crisis in soccer, which reached a new level Thursday with the suspension of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and others.\nRELATED: FIFA BOOTS FORMER CONCACAF BOSS WARNER FOR LIFE\nFormer CONCACAF secretary general Chuck Blazer began cooperating with the investigation in 2011 and later secretly pleaded guilty. His former boss and wingman, Jack Warner of Trinidad, has been indicted, and was involved in the 2005 television broadcast contract that Swiss authorities have seized upon to open a criminal investigation against Blatter. Blatter denies any alleged wrongdoing.\nThe new acting president of FIFA is Issa Hayatou of Cameroon , who assumes the office on an interim basis because he is the longest-serving vice-president on FIFA's executive committee. But Blatter hasn't fully surrendered. On Friday, two of his attorneys — one from a firm in Switzerland, the other American-based — issued a joint statement about their appeal of Blatter's banishment from FIFA activities.\n\"We can confirm that we have requested additional proceedings before the Adjudicatory Chamber of the Ethics Committee and filed an appeal with the Appeal Committee,\" said the lawyers, Lorenz Erni of Zurich and Richard Cullen of Richmond, Virginia.\nRelated Stories Jailed FIFA exec Esquivel will remain in Swiss custody Four major sponsors call on Sepp Blatter to step down Sepp Blatter won't resign FIFA post immediately Tags: fifa", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:40:25.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
