It started to fall together last week, and since then our offense has been clicking.” \nDalton Bunn, the versatile Blue Devil, provided his team with a jolt early as the junior returned a punt for West Central’s first score. \nBunn’s message to the team after his return: “Hey, we can do this, we can put points on the board. This is our game, we can get this done.” \nCedar Valley Christian did answer early as Apollo Betsworth rushed in from four yards out for a score. \nBut on the next West Central drive, Bunn was at it again, this time capping a 66-yard drive with a 1-yard TD run. \nBlue Devils quarterback Brady Forsyth then got in on the scoring action, first on a 60-yard TD on West Central’s next possession. Then Forsyth found Collin Kime for a 33-yard score. On the next possession, Bunn scored on a 40-yard TD. Two more scores made it 49-6 at half. \nThe Huskies never packed it in, however, as Colin Heeren grabbed two TD passes from Travis Geels in the third.
