Seven years later, the rematch's legacy could be shaped by a more natural factor.\nThere's about a 100-percent chance of rain Saturday afternoon in Athens, National Weather Center meteorologist Ryan Willis told AL.com on Thursday evening. And it's going to be heavy.\nThe most soaking rains are expected in the afternoon when Alabama meets Georgia at 2:30 p.m. in Sanford Stadium. Willis said 2-3 inches-plus is in the current models with \"persistent, heavy rainfall.\"\n\"So it could get pretty messy,\" he said.\nThe geography of Athens and Sanford Stadium is unique. The 92,746-seat facility is built into the side of a steep hill. Longtime Georgia sports information director Claude Felton said Sanford Stadium has never flooded and the natural-turf field has good drainage.\nRELATED: Rewinding Mark Richt's thoughts on Bo Scarbrough, playing in rain, injury update\nSeveral days of heavy rain in Athens led the school to close overflow parking lots on grass intramural fields. That eliminates 2,000 of the 15,000 spots on campus for a typical game day.\nWillis said an upper-level low will interact with the moisture of Hurricane Joaquin off shore in the Atlantic Ocean. It will push heavy rain into South Carolina and eastern portions of Georgia. Record-breaking rainfall is possible in South Carolina.\n\"But it's pretty much certain (Athens) is going to get a lot of rain,\" Willis said.\nWhat's that mean for a game plan?\n\"I'll play rain, sleet, snow,\" Alabama linebacker Denzel Devall said.\" It doesn't matter. We practice sometimes in the rain and stuff like that. You never know the situation, so we'll be prepared whether it's raining or not.\"\nGeorgia coach Mark Richt joked about not having an indoor practice facility giving his team an opportunity to work in the rain Tuesday afternoon. He said he doesn't get too wrapped up in the forecast a few days in advance.\nThe rain has to be very hard or wind must be beyond stiff for the plan to change, Richt said.\nAlabama's major issue with weather came last year when the September game with FAU was called with 7:53 left because of lightning. Georgia's 2015 season-opener with Louisiana Monroe was shortened for the same reason.", "external_links": ["http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/uga-alerts-fans-to-expect-parking-traffic-challenges-for-alabama-footb/"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:21:34.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
