Syracuse Scout reporter Mike McAllister reported that the two sides mutually agreed to \"part ways.\" \nNeither report included a named source. UCLA TE transfer Chris Clark is no longer going to Syracuse. Sounds like the Orange staff isn't honoring his commitment. @CuseOnRivals — Chris Peak (@PantherLair) October 26, 2015 BREAKING: Chris Clark and Syracuse part ways, sources tell CuseNation https://t.co/guuVmw3TR6 pic.twitter.com/a2MPbbyF7F — Mike McAllister (@McAllisterScout) October 26, 2015 \nClark, 6-foot-6 and 247 pounds, was a five-star recruit out of Avon Old Farms (Conn.), and briefly attended UCLA at the start of the season. He left the school after reportedly dealing with illness and homesickness. He had also committed to both Michigan and North Carolina before settling on UCLA. \nHe elected to transfer, choosing Syracuse over Pittsburgh as his destination on October 15. He would not have been able to play until 2017. \nHe told Scout that his reason for choosing Syracuse was because of how well he fit into the program. \n\"Just because of how comfortable I feel there,\" Clark told CuseNation.com. \"All the guys on the team I felt really comfortable with. It's really close to home and I like the closeness of the school. It's just a good fit. \nClark visited both schools and, at least at one point, planned to attend Saturday's game between the two. \nContact Chris Carlson anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-412-1639.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:23:04.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
