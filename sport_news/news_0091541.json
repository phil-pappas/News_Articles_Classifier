NOAA GOES satellite image At 10 p.m., Joaquin was about 20 miles east-southeast of Long Island, Bahamas and about 7 5miles south of San Salvador. The storm – a Category 4 – had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and was moving west at 3 mph.\nIt was expected to move near or over portions of the central Bahamas overnight.\nBrown said the storm should turn north Friday, and then move north-northwest at a faster forward speed Friday night and Saturday. Joaquin still could strengthen tonight and Friday, forecasters said.\nThe storm battered trees and buildings as surging waters reached the windows of some homes on Long Island in the Bahamas and inundated the airport runway at Ragged Island. There were no immediate reports of casualties, according to Capt. Stephen Russell, the director of the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency.\n Prime Minister Perry Christie said he was amending laws to mandate evacuations because some people were refusing to move into shelters.\n\"We do not know the impact of 130 miles an hour on those areas,\" he said, referring to the hurricane's winds. \"We know it's a horrific kind of experience.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/pgthumb/img/jersey-journal/photo/2015/10/01/-50ae1e0c483faf01.JPG",
