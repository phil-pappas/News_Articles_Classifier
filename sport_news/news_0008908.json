The Miners have outscored opponents 278-58, which includes a 38-20 loss at Bishop Gorman (Las Vegas, Nevada) that was then ranked No. 1 in the nation by MaxPreps.com. \nBoth teams, though, know the battle will be anything but easy, and the Miners' 33-game winning streak against in-state opponents will be put to the test. \nClick the video to see a preview of the game, and watch it live via the embedded video below or on live.ksl.com .
