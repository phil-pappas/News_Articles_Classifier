Injured forwards Ben Smith (ear laceration) and Joonas Donskoi (lower body) also practiced Friday. \nThe Sharks are thankful Thornton is not as questionable. Thornton said Friday he was feeling no ill effects after he fell backward onto the ice the night before with 1:55 left in the first period after a takedown from Los Angeles Kings defenseman Jake Muzzin. \nThornton said it was a problem with his skate blade that caused him to look shaky as he skated toward the bench and walked into the Sharks dressing room. \n\"I don't know what happened to it, but I just couldn't get my blade back on the ice. It happens,\" Thornton said, adding later with a smile that teammate Mike Brown \"had the same thing a couple games earlier. Something's going on with the steel around here.\" \nThornton was cleared to play after passing concussion protocol tests and returned to the ice slightly more than three minutes into the second period. He finished with 17:38 of ice time as the Sharks lost 4-1 to the Kings for their third straight defeat. Advertisement \nThornton said he went through about five or six tests before he was cleared to play, \"and as far as I know, I aced them.\" He said the testing took about 10 minutes. He then needed to put back on his equipment. \n\"If they see anything that might raise an eyebrow, they just take you in,\" Thornton said. \"So they just said get the skate fixed, go through the concussion protocol and then go back out.\" \nMartin's return hasn't been as simple. He said he was hurt Oct. 16 when he skated behind the Sharks net and got hit by a New Jersey Devils player. He said his skate got caught in a rut on the ice, which caused a tweak in his lower body. \nMartin also skated before Thursday's game against the Kings but did not play. \n\"I'd like to. Two days of skating and really no issues yet,\" Martin said of playing against Carolina. \"I'm sure we'll wait and see how it feels (Saturday) after the first actual practice with the guys. But my plan would be to play tomorrow.\" \nThe Sharks haven't been the same team, particularly on the penalty kill, without Martin or Logan Couture in the lineup. Teamed with Brent Burns, Martin had averaged nearly 23 minutes of ice time per game in his first four contests with San Jose and was a major presence on the penalty kill unit. \nMartin was on the ice for a combined 14:11 -- most for any San Jose player -- for the first four games when the Sharks were down a man, as they killed 16 of their first 17 penalties. Since then, the Sharks have allowed four goals in eight power-play attempts by the opposition. The Kings converted two of four power plays in their win Thursday. \n\"I think during a season, you're going to have stretches where you do the same thing you did the week before except it ends up in your net,\" Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said. \nIt appears Donskoi is closer to returning than Smith. Donskoi skated on the top line with Thornton and Joe Pavelski. \n\"We'll see tomorrow. We got some guys that were out at practice, got some guys through practice,\" DeBoer said. \"A lot's going to depend on how they react overnight and what they feel like tomorrow morning. Guys are definitely getting closer.\" \nJoel Ward spent some time with the first power-play unit in Friday's practice, and DeBoer said it was a small reward for a player who he thought was one of his better forwards against the Kings. Ward had a goal on three shots. \nForward Micheal Haley was reassigned to the Barracuda of the AHL. Haley had four hits with one blocked shot in 6:48 of ice time against the Kings.
