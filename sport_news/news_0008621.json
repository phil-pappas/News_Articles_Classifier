Full transparency,\" Mutlu said. \"If he does not come, then the suspicions will only grow stronger and will damage the sport.\" \nThe DFB refused to comment when repeatedly contacted by Reuters on the invitation to the hearing. \nThe DFB boss has been invited to respond to allegations from both media and his predecessor, Theo Zwanziger, that a slush fund containing 6.7 million euros (5 million pounds) was used to buy votes backing of Germany's 2006 world Cup bid in 2000. \n\"THE KAISER\" \nDer Spiegel magazine said both Niersbach, a vice president of the organising committee at the time, and Franz Beckenbauer, a former World Cup-winning player and coach who headed Germany's World Cup organising committee, allegedly knew about it. \n\"And at the heart of it all, Franz Beckenbauer, the Kaiser, remains silent,\" Mutlu said. Beckenbauer, one of the great sporting heroes of Germany, issued a brief statement more than a week ago denying the allegations but has not spoken since. \nNiersbach also denies any wrongdoing but the DFB president has confirmed the association is investigating a transfer of that amount to FIFA in 2005, raising further speculation. \n\"With the ongoing revelations in the media there is the feeling that the FIFA scandal has now firmly arrived at the DFB,\" Mutlu said. \"We can now also talk about a DFB scandal.\" \n\"Donâ€™t forget that there was also tax money invested in the World Cup...so, for this reason, we as politicians have the obligation to ask these questions and demand full transparency.\" \n(Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; editing by Ralph Boulton )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:23:52.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
