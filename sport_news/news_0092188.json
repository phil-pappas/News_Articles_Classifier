On Saturday against No. 1 Ohio State, they need a win. (Photo: File photo) 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPISCATAWAY – When last seen in primetime, Rutgers was giving an inspiring effort against No. 4 Michigan State. \nMoral victories mattered two weeks ago and there were plenty of positives to be taken from a 31-24 loss, with head coach Kyle Flood suspended and off-field issues still dominating the narrative . \nNow, an actual victory is the only thing that matters against No. 1 Ohio State. \nThe kind of post-game energy associated with their victory over No. 3 Louisville in 2006 is what will move the Scarlet Knights forward at this point, not simply playing well. \n``Anything short of that is considered a failure,’’ fullback Sam Bergen said. ``That’s why you play the game. You play to win, and we feel like we’re more than ready. We have the players and the coaching staff and the plan to go out there and give it our best shot.’’ Rutgers football nearly upset No. 1, national champs Miami in 2002 \nSo while scaring the heck out of unbeaten Michigan State, which needed a 3-yard touchdown run by LJ Scott with 43 seconds left to survive, was uplifting for the Scarlet Knights, they’re not looking for another gold star for effort. \n``There are no moral victories in major college football. It’s not something we ever talk about,’’ Flood said. \nThe atmosphere at High Point Solutions Stadium Saturday night will be electric, with a national network television audience looking in after the Scarlet Knights backed their performance against the Spartans up with a stirring comeback win on the road last weekend at Indiana. \n``Ohio State is what you’d expect from a No. 1 team in the country,’’ left tackle Keith Lumpkin said. \n``We’ve got to just play like we know we can play, and finish. That’s what we’ve said we want to do, finish better. We did that, we finished last week. Now we’ve got to bring that same effort, so our main focus is to finish this week.’’ 'Best atmosphere in college football': Rutgers vs. Ohio State? \nFinishing last week meant erasing a 25-point third quarter deficit at Indiana, equaling the feat this team pulled off in the regular season finale last year at Maryland. \nOf course, finishing off the unbeaten defending national champions will be a bit more problematic. Still, if you’re looking to make a statement in front of the college football universe, the stage is there. \n```We don’t take a backseat to anyone,’’ Bergen said. ``We’re a talented football team. We have great players, great staff. We feel like we can play with the best programs in the country.’’ \nBut can they beat the best? \n``All we’re trying to do is come out on Saturday night and play to the best of our abilities,’’ Flood said. ``To win the situations we know ultimately create a 1-0 situation for us on Saturday. All our focus is on drive start, turnovers, explosive plays.’’ \nShould the Scarlet Knights indeed walk off the field 1-0 Saturday night, and 4-3 on the season with a second straight Big Ten victory, there’s no telling what the impact could be on the future of the program. \nAnd moving forward, the time for moral victories has come and gone for Rutgers. \nStaff writer Stephen Edelson is an Asbury Park Press columnist: sedelson@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LM5VRZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:55:40.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
