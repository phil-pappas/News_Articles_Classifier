(Photo by Jeff Curry/Getty Images) Kevin Harvick did it: Needing to win at Dover, Harvick dominated the AAA 400 by leading 355 of 400 laps.\nAdChoices Victory put Harvick into the second leg of the Chase for the Sprint Cup. The other element of Sunday: Who didn't make cut. Would you believe Jimmie Johnson?\nJohnson, a six-time Cup champion and 10-time winner at Dover, saw his Chase end when his car's rear end failed. Johnson spent 36 laps in the garage getting repairs. It proved to be too much to overcome.\n\"It's disappointing,\" Johnson said in a post-race interview. An inexpensive part sealed his doom.\nBurn 'em down, @KevinHarvick ! #TheChase pic.twitter.com/Y9KkHyb2qX\n— #TheChase (@NASCAR) October 4, 2015\nJamie McMurray finished fourth on Sunday, a place behind Dale Earnhardt Jr. Earnhardt advanced because of a tiebreaker. McMurray was done. After the race, Earnhardt and McMurray embraced in a token of sportsmanship.\nPost-race hug. #NASCAR pic.twitter.com/lD4ulQ0jd3\n— Jeff Gluck (@jeff_gluck) October 4, 2015\nAlso out of the Chase: Clint Bowyer, who like Harvick needed to win to survive; and Paul Menard.\nHarvick was unstoppable. Nothing, no one, no quirk of fate could keep him from winning. He started on the eighth row, pushed his car through the early traffic to take the lead by Lap 26. After that, it was total domination.\nThe only question came when Harvick pitted with about 85 laps to go. That's about the maximum length of racing he could go on a tank of gas.\nThat fuel question died with Brett Moffitt hit the wall with Harvick on Lap 354. Another late incident, when Landon Cassill's engine blew, sealed the deal.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASCAR?src=hash", "http://t.co/lD4ulQ0jd3", "https://twitter.com/NASCAR/status/650796260509806592", "https://twitter.com/jeff_gluck/status/650796158302978048", "https://twitter.com/KevinHarvick", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheChase?src=hash", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://t.co/Y9KkHyb2qX"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:06:08.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
