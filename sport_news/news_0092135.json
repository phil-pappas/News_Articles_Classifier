The Fighting Irish also drove 67 yards in four plays late in the third quarter to tie it at 28-28 on a 50-yard touchdown run. LSU’s defense allowed 449 yards as the Tigers fell from No. 22 in the nation to out of the top 25. \nLast Saturday, Mills played for the first time in the 2015 season after suffering a fractured fibula (leg bone connected to the ankle joint) in practice last August. He rejoined a team that is now the highest ranked Southeastern Conference team in the nation at No. 5 with a 6-0 overall mark and 4-0 record in the league entering Saturday’s 6 p.m. game against Western Kentucky (6-1, 4-0 Conference USA) on ESPNU in Tiger Stadium. \nIn two weeks, Mills will get to play in what could be the SEC game of the year when LSU plays at No. 8 Alabama (6-1, 3-1 SEC) on Nov. 7. \n“It’s great,” said Mills, who was in on about 20 snaps Saturday as the Tigers defeated then-No. 8 Florida, 35-28, at Tiger Stadium. “Once you get out there on the field, you know what everybody’s playing for, everybody’s state of mind. Once I got on the field, I had that same state of mind. We’re a bunch of hungry guys who want that national championship at the end of the year. It felt great getting back in the swing of things against a team like Florida. It was just a great feeling.” \nMills is guarding against being too eager as his season will just be six games plus the postseason as he tries to reach that national championship while impressing NFL scouts. The senior from DeSoto, Texas, turned down a chance for a mid-round selection in the NFL Draft last spring to stay for his senior year at LSU. \n“No, no, no, I’m not going to try to do too much and make all these big plays,” he said. “That’s when the big plays happen that you don’t want to happen. I just want to go out there and just play my football. Just play the way I can and play for my teammates.” \nLSU coach Les Miles and defensive coordinator Kevin Steele hope Mills can also help the secondary stop allowing big pass plays in the second half, which has been the case all season. \n“We had some breakdowns in secondary coverage and didn’t make some adjustments. I think Jalen Mills being back certainly will help,” Miles said. \n“It’s just been a lack of communication,” Mills said. “Communication is key.” \nMills, the veteran of LSU’s secondary as its only senior, is the lead communicator. \n“It’s about film study, knowing what’s coming before it comes,” he said. “Just anticipating a lot of different things. Just me being here, just knowing the defense, hopefully that will help. I just want to help the guys out and get the guys more comfortable.” \nLSU will need strong secondary play to win Saturday. Western Kentucky is a 16-point underdog, but the Hilltoppers have one of the nation’s best quarterbacks in senior Brandon Doughty, who is No. 2 in the nation in passing efficiency at 186.4 and No. 3 in passing yards a game with 387. He is 197 of 266 on the season for 2,709 yards and 24 touchdowns with four interceptions. LSU sophomore quarterback Brandon Harris has climbed to No. 49 in the nation in passing efficiency at 140.7 with 64 completions in 108 attempts for 812 yards and six touchdowns with zero interceptions. (Harris’ turnover against Eastern Michigan was changed to a fumble after originally being ruled an interception.) \n“He’s every bit an SEC quarterback – big, talented, strong, smart, big arm,” Miles said. “You watch the film, and it’ll get your attention.” \nMills has noticed. \n“He’s a great quarterback. You can tell he knows the system,” he said. “He’s a pocket guy, so he’s a gunslinger. He can throw the ball vertically. He knows the system. He reads coverages pretty well, so we have to disguise those a little more, and guys just have to buckle down.” Read or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/college/lsu/2015/10/20/lsus-jalen-mills-happy-field/74296596/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:42:03.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
