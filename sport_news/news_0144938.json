The Lady Wolverines wanted to secure their spot in the Class state playoff in their match against Milton, and they did so by rallying to win 19-25, 25-15, 25-14 on Tuesday at Pope High School.“I hate playing from behind, but (the team seems) to like it,” Woodstock coach Anita Dodd quipped. With the win, the fourth-seeded Lady Wolverines were assured of at least the fourth spot out of Area 5 . Had Woodstock lost, it would have had to play its archrival once again for the No. 5 spot out of the area. Etowah, the No. 3 seed in the tournament, was upset by Pope 25-22, 25-18 following a heartbreaking 24-26, 25-20, 29-27 loss to No. 2 Lassiter in the winners' bracket. Instead of facing Woodstock, Etowah was left to beat Milton on Wednesday to keep its season alive.After a sluggish first set against Milton, Woodstock jumped ahead early in the second and third sets to set the tone.Emily Harris had 14 kills, 11 digs and three aces for Woodstock, while Sierra Griffin added 10 kills and 11 digs. McKenzie Keeton also had 11 digs and Sydney Torres finished with seven kills.“The girls realized they didn’t want to bust it to get to state,” Dodd said. “They wanted to get assurance.” Woodstock was set to play Pope for a chance to advance in the losers' bracket. A loss would guarantee the Lady Wolverines the fourth seed in the playoffs.As for Etowah, it was left with some work to do to secure a playoff position. Things were looking promising when the Lady Eagles stormed back from three match points down in the third set to tie it. The Lady Eagles seemed to have the momentum once the score was 25-all and had two match-point chances to win it, but they couldn’t put Lassiter away.The hangover of the Lassiter match carried over into its next match against Pope. Natalie Lucco had 15 kills against Lassiter and ended up with just three against the Lady Greyhounds. Paige Horton came through with 11 kills against Lassiter and was down to five against Pope. Nicole Ferris ended up leading Etowah offensively against Pope with 11 kills. “We had a tough match against Lassiter and it was tough to recover,” Etowah coach Kim Robertson said. “I give credit to Pope. They stepped up.”Cherokee ended its season following straight-set losses to Walton and Pope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:15:07.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
