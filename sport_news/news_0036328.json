And it is in this area that our wide range of capabilities, propelled by our 'One P&L' philosophy would come to the fore.\nWe look forward to pushing the benchmark to the highest level.\"\nKartik Iyer, managing director of Carat India, said, \"Mondelez is present in some of the most exciting and dynamic categories and we are very excited to partner them in their growth plans for the country.\"\nThe account size is said to be in the region of Rs 550 crore and with this, Bhasin says the Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN), of which Carat is a part, is well on course of his vision of being the second-largest advertising agency network in the country by end-2017. What the win also does for Carat is boost its business in western India. While the global pitch win helped the DAN firm get the business, the exercise of winning the account required convincing the global giant that the Indian arm of the media agency could handle all of Mondelez's media investments efficiently, digital included.\nAccording to sources, Carat is setting up a 60-odd member team to work on the Mondelez account. Senior media professional Ruby Bana who served Madison as chief strategy officer is likely to join the agency given the account win.\nIn arrangement with MxMIndia.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:28:22.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
