I couldn't sit here and say I am going to play five or ten more years, but it's something which I have not even thought about,\" he added. \nWith the Red Devils currently on a two-year trophy drought, Rooney, who has won the Premier League five times and the Champions league once with United, says he is desperate to get back to the glory days which the club enjoyed under former manager Alex Ferguson. \n\"We want to get back to winning trophies, of course. That is why you play football -- to try and be successful, certainly at this club,\" Rooney said. \n\"In the last few years we haven't been good enough. There has been a big change in the club over the last few years and it's now starting to settle back down into a good rhythm with what the manager wants from us and we are improving,\" he added. \n(Reporting by Shravanth Vijayakumar in Bengaluru.
