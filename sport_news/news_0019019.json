Bartolo Colon relieved, and Howie Kendrick hit a grounder up the middle. \nSecond baseman Daniel Murphy flipped to Tejada, who took the throw awkwardly for an apparent force as Utley slid past the bag and slammed into him, causing Tejada to flip over as the tying run scored from third. \nTejada was put on a flatbed vehicle after an air cast was placed on his leg. The Mets said Flores sustained a fractured right fibula. \nUtley was ruled safe on a video review, which determined Tejada's foot missed the bag. Utley also appeared not to touch the base. \nLos Angeles scored four runs in the inning and went on to win 5-2. © Copyright (c)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:18:36.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
