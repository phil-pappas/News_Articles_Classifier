Dan Carpenter currently ranks as the most accurate Bills kicker in team history at 88.8 percent. 49 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nORCHARD PARK - There were no wink winks in the Buffalo Bills locker room Wednesday afternoon, and maybe that's because the changing of kickoff specialists really was just a simple player for player transaction. \nHowever, it's not hard to connect the dots and come to the conclusion that there's probably more to Buffalo's signing of veteran kicker Billy Cundiff to replace Jordan Gay. \nBuffalo's placekicker, Dan Carpenter, has been in coach Rex Ryan's crosshairs since training camp at St. John Fisher College, and on a couple of occasions Ryan has made it clear he demands as close to perfection as possible from the kicker. After all, the kicker, whoever it is, is on the roster to make kicks, plain and simple. \nAfter missing four in the preseason, Carpenter has missed three in the first four weeks of the regular season, and Ryan's patience may have run out. Cundiff, a 12-year veteran, can be almost as effective as Gay on kickoffs, with the added benefit of having a career 76.2 percent success rate on field goals. Thus, it should come as no surprise later in the week if the Bills cut ties with Carpenter and save a roster spot by handing all the kicking duties to Cundiff. \nBuffalo Bills kicker Dan Carpenter.

Now with Carpenter struggling, this looks like the perfect time to remedy that situation because Cundiff was available, and can do both jobs. \n\"Billy is a guy who has a history in this league,\" Ryan said of Cundiff, who also had tryouts with the Eagles and Buccaneers this week. \"He has a strong leg and can handle kickoffs and has been a good kicker. With Jordan, sometimes carrying a kickoff guy isn't the best thing for your team. Jordan did a tremendous job in the role that he had, and that doesn't mean we wouldn't have Cundiff kick off and Carpenter do our (place) kicks. I think Jordan needs to work on his consistency as a field-goal kicker, but there's no reason he can't kick in the league.\" Bills sign RB Herron; Karlos Williams has concussion \nThe Bills are going to need a spot on the 53-man roster because defensive end IK Enemkpali's four-game suspension is up. He has to be signed to the active roster or else he would be subjected to waivers. So, the Bills will likely keep Carpenter until they have to activate Enemkpali this weekend, just in case something odd happens with the roster, or Cundiff simply doesn't look good. \"We'll see how everything plays out,\" said Ryan. \n\"Whether someone's here or not, it makes no difference,\" Carpenter said, the inference being that there's always pressure on a kicker to perform because there's always someone waiting in the wings to take his job. \"This just means if they want to change something, then maybe it's more simple because (Cundiff's) here already instead of getting on a flight.\" \nDuring his two years with the Bills, Carpenter has been the most accurate field goal kicker in Bills history at 88.8 percent (72 of 81). But he was hampered in the preseason trying to bounce back from a hamstring injury, and he is also currently dealing with a sore left knee, his plant leg. \nCleveland Browns kicker Billy Cundiff walks back to the bench after missing a field goal against the Buffalo Bills during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 30, 2014, in Orchard Park, N.J. (AP Photo/Bill Wippert) (Photo: Bill Wippert, AP) \nCundiff is a well-traveled veteran who spent the 2014 season with the Cleveland Browns. He has appeared in 135 career games and made 182 of 239 field goals and 277 of 278 PATâ€™s for 823 points. Cundiff, 35, originally entered the NFL in 2003 with the Dallas Cowboys, and has also kicked for New Orleans, Baltimore, and Washington. \n\"I'm here to kickoff and everything else is on a need to know basis,\" Cundiff said when asked what he was told. \"So right now I'm just preparing to do the best I can kicking off and we'll see what else happens.\" \nCundiff has been out of work this season, so he enrolled at Arizona State and is working on obtaining his masters in real estate development. \n\"I was told to prepare for life after football the minute I got in it, so technically I've been preparing for life outside football since 2002,\" Cundiff said with a smile. \"I found something I want to do post-football. I already have my MBA, so I've continually pursued education. I've always trained like I'm going to play tomorrow, and prepared off the field like I'll never play again.\" 49 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1LiacMZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:06:33.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
