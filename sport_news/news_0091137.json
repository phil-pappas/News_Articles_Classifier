Bulldogs cut ties with Grant in AFL \nJarrad Grant is looking for a new AFL club after the Western Bulldogs severed ties with the former top-five pick on Friday. \nGrant, 26, was selected by the Bulldogs with the fifth overall pick at the 2007 draft but was largely unable to live up to that lofty billing in eight seasons with the club. \nThe Bulldogs were unable to find a new AFL home for Grant, who played in 19 games this season, during the trade period and informed him he would not be offered a new contract on Friday. \nThe tall forward kicked 83 goals in 81 senior appearances for the Dogs. \nAs an unrestricted free agent, he is free to sign with any AFL club or can nominate for Novemberâ€™s draft.
