The Trojans were ready and answered the challenge, downing the Eagles 35-28 in a barnburner. \nOCS drew first blood in the game with quarterback Grant Fitzhugh, son of head coach Steven Fitzhugh, connecting with receiver Judge Fortenberry on a 20-yard pass to give the Eagles the 7-0 lead early. The Trojans would be quick to answer though, driving downfield and capping off the drive with X’stavious Dorty punching it in for the 3-yard score to tie the game, 7-7. Eagles running back Josh Pennebaker, the sixth leading rusher in the state heading into the game, then took it 35 yards for the touchdown to give OCS the 14-7 lead to end the first quarter. \nThen early in the second quarter, the Trojans drove downfield and tied the game again 14-14 with a 4-yard pass from Matt Beck, a LSU baseball commit, to Austin Bell. With two minutes until halftime, Beck got his second touchdown pass of the game, connecting with sophomore Tyler Clark for a 29-yard touchdown to give the Trojans the 21-14 lead at halftime. \nAlexandria carried over the scoring display from the second quarter on to the third quarter with senior running back Kyle Smith scoring a 4-yard touchdown run to extend the Trojan lead to 28-14 with the only score in the third quarter from either team. \nThe Eagles were down, but they were not out with Fitzhugh scoring on the ground this time on a 10-yard touchdown run to trim the Trojan lead to 28-21. Ouachita Christian would get the ball back after Beck threw his first interception of the season, which the Eagles turned into touchdown on a long 81-yard pass from Fitzhugh to senior Nick Sumrall to tie the game 28-28. \nAlexandriatook the lead back with 1:36 left in the game with a two-yard touchdown pass from Beck to Clark, which proved to be the winning touchdown. But OCS had a last ditch effort to score ending with a series of laterals, similar to that of Texas Tech in their loss to TCU last weekend, getting down to the 10-yard line before being tackled, sealing the thrilling victory for the Trojans. \n“They were a great team and they fought hard,” ASH quarterback Matt Beck said. “It was a real slobberknocker.” \nBeck had another big game, going 20 for 33 passing for 251 yards and 3 touchdowns. \n“He’s great,” head coach Sam Goodwin said about his quarterback. “He’s the best I’ve ever been around. He’s smart and a dedicated athlete; he’s got it all. \n“It had everything you would want in a game,\" Goodwin added. \"We had some great plays and so did they. Coach Fitzhugh is a great coach. Our guys really rose to the occasion.” \nJosh Pennebaker led the Eagles running game with 22 carries for 145 yards and a touchdown while Grant Fitzhugh had a huge game passing for OCS, going 17 for 30 for 320 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. \nNext week the Trojans (4-1) will take on the Pineville Rebels in the Red River Rivalry and the first district game of the season. Ouachita Christian (4-1) will head back on the road again to take on Sterlington for their first district game as well. 9 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/sports/high-school/football/2015/10/03/ocs-vs-ash/73194548/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:13:41.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
