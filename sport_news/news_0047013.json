I know how I feel.\n\"Obviously you're not going to be able to take every gun out, I don't know how you can do that,\" James said. \"There's so many around now, today. But if there's some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves.\"\n\nLeBron James has often been outspoken regarding tragedies. During December of last year, James spoke to the media about police violence, race, and both peaceful and destructive protests that were happening in the wake of the deaths of Mike Brown in Ferguson and Tamir Rice in Cleveland. Back in 2012, James and his teammates posed in a team photo wearing hoodies after Trayvon Martin was killed. He was one of the players who followed Derrick Rose wearing \"I Can't Breathe\" T-shirts this past season following the death of Eric Garner in New York.\n\nTopics: Derrick Rose , LeBron James , Cleveland Cavaliers , NBA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:53:38.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
