(Abby Drey/Centre Daily Times via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT; MAGS OUT MBI more > By TERRY HUTCHENS - Associated Press - Monday, October 12, 2015 \nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - Indiana has a quarterback question to answer before this weekend’s game against Rutgers. \nStarter Nate Sudfeld didn’t play against Penn State last Saturday because of an ankle injury and backup Zander Diamont was knocked out of the game with an injury to his throwing shoulder. Freshman Danny Cameron led the team for the final quarter and a half of the 29-7 loss on the road. \nIndiana (4-2, 0-2 Big Ten) needs to settle on a quarterback for the homecoming game against Rutgers (2-3, 0-2). \nCoach Kevin Wilson said Monday that Sudfeld did the most work Sunday night than he had in a week but that his senior quarterback would be evaluated throughout this week. \n“He did a few things last week and he was at practice but he didn’t have any live throws until Friday,” Wilson said. “We’ll see how Nate does. He was cleared to play (against Penn State) but I didn’t think he was mobile enough to run around and extend some plays and protect himself.” \nSudfeld first sprained his ankle in the Sept. 26 victory at Wake Forest. He played into the third quarter against Ohio State two weeks ago but eventually gave way to Diamont. Sudfeld has completed 59.2 percent of his passes for 1,277 yards with seven touchdowns and one interception this season. He is 4-1 as the starter. \nWilson said Diamont did not work out Sunday and he could be out for 1-2 weeks. If that’s the case, Cameron would be the No. 2 behind Sudfeld or be forced into the starting spot if Sudfeld can’t go. Junior Nate Boudreau, who played against Michigan and Michigan State a year ago, would back up Cameron. \nThe quarterback position has been a revolving door at Indiana for the last few seasons. Three years ago, Tre Roberson opened the season as the starter before breaking his leg in the second game against Massachusetts. Cameron Coffman started the final 10 games. In 2013, Sudfeld and Roberson were both used extensively in a platoon role and Coffman was used as an emergency option. Last year, Sudfeld started the first six games before suffering a left shoulder injury at Iowa that ended his season. Backup Chris Covington suffered a season ending ACL injury in that game, too. Diamont started the final six games. \nThis year, Indiana has used three quarterbacks in the last two games alone. Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Kevin Johns said he believes because so many people have played that position in recent years the team is ready for adversity. \n“If it’s Diamont, Sudfeld or Danny Cameron, we kind of feel that our offense is multiple enough that we can adjust and put guys in the right places,” Johns said. “It’s part of the job. It’s part of the business. Injuries happen and we have to prepare and be ready for it.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:04:54.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
