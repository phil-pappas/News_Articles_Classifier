Many parts of Texas, including the metro regions of Austin, Dallas and Houston, could see upward of 12 inches of rain by Saturday.\nRainfall totals had already surpassed that level by Friday evening in some areas, including more than 13 inches at the airport in Corsicana, 50 miles south of Dallas.\nThe rains left many roads and highways awash, causing some vehicles to stall. Interstate 35 near Waco and Interstate 45 near Corsicana was closed by high water at times Friday. No injuries or significant damage has been reported.\nTorrential rains across North and Central Texas closed heavily traveled highways for a while and scrambled the schedule of high school and college football games.\nAs much as 7 more inches of rain was forecast for the Waco-Corsicana corridor. In South Texas, emergency workers are concerned the current system will be followed by the wet remnants of powerful Hurricane Patricia, which made landfall Friday evening in southwestern Mexico.\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Kurt Van Speybroeck said as the hurricane moves inland, the mountains of Mexico \"will shred Patricia apart,\" but the weakened system will continue moving north and eventually bring another round of rain to Texas before moving into Arkansas, Louisiana and beyond.\n\"It's definitely going to be beneficial when it comes to the drought and fire concerns we've had over several weeks in Texas,\" Van Speybroeck said.\nBut for emergency officials a primary concern is the widespread flooding anticipated over the weekend. Official in Hidalgo County planned to hand out free sandbags to help residents prepare for the expected deluge.\nThe potential for flooding comes five months after torrential spring storms caused more than 30 deaths and left large swaths of the state underwater.\nThe Memorial Day weekend brought an astonishing amount of rainfall, with some isolated areas receiving more than 20 inches. Homes were either damaged or swept away by river water southwest of Austin, about 1,500 homes in the Houston area alone sustained flood damage, and neighborhoods throughout the state were cut off by rising waters.\nLittle rain has fallen since then.\nNim Kidd, chief of the state emergency management office, on Friday encouraged people to stay off roadways and avoid high water.\n\"This is a dangerous situation that will be developing over the weekend,\" Kidd said.\nNational Weather Service forecaster Lamont Bain said the Dallas-Fort Worth area received 3 to 5 inches of rain since Thursday morning, in waves of showers.\nDallas-Fort Worth International Airport set a record Thursday with 4.60 inches of rain, breaking the Oct. 22 rainfall record of 2.19 inches set in 1908, according to the NWS.\n\"We had a very wet spring and then the summer and fall, the first part of the fall, proved to be very, very dry,\" Bain said. \"The rain is certainly welcome across the area.\"\nMore than half of the state's 254 counties had outdoor burn bans in effect Friday, due to previous dry conditions, the Texas A&M Forest Service reported.\nThe soggy weather spoiled some outdoor homecoming weekend activities at Baylor University in Waco. The world's largest Baptist university, with nearly 17,000 students enrolled this fall, canceled a Friday night bonfire and fireworks show. No. 2 Baylor hosts Iowa State on Saturday.\nRain and lightning also were affecting Grand Prix racing in Austin.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
