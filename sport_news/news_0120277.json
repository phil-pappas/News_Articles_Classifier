Dombrowski almost certainly will acquire a proven No. 1 starter, either through a trade or by talking principal owner John Henry into finally taking the plunge for David Price , Jordan Zimmermann , Johnny Cueto or another free agent who will cost big bucks despite being on the wrong side of his 30th birthday.\nHere, then, is another name to keep in mind: Zack Greinke .\nGreinke is expected to opt out of his contract with the Dodgers — and for good reason. After going 19-3 with a league-leading 1.66 ERA and 200 strikeouts in 2222⁄3 innings this season, the 32-year-old right-hander may well double the three years and $71 million left on his existing deal, even in a market that is flush with free agent options.\nOn the surface, Greinke hardly seems like a fit for the Red Sox. He nearly quit baseball in 2006 after being diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and clinical depression. Even now, with one Cy Young Award on his mantle, another possibly on the way and his condition controlled by prescription medication, his eyes tend to dart around a room when he’s surrounded by reporters and television cameras. He rarely appears comfortable in those settings.\nGreinke has spent three seasons pitching for the big-market Dodgers, but the attention was shared with co-ace Clayton Kershaw . In Boston, Greinke would be the No. 1 starter the Sox haven’t had since they traded Jon Lester 15 months ago — a position that comes with considerable scrutiny every fifth day and often on the days in between.\nDespite having not spoken to Greinke about his potential options, a source close to the pitcher speculated last week he “definitely wouldn’t want any more stress or additional media attention.”\nBut Greinke also has relationships with two members of the Sox baseball operations department. Senior vice president of player personnel Allard Baird was the Royals general manager when Kansas City took Greinke with the sixth overall pick in the 2002 draft. Director of pitching analysis and development Brian Bannister played for the Royals from 2007-10 and is widely credited by Greinke with helping him understand advanced metrics and use them to his advantage.\nIf anyone knows whether Greinke could handle the spotlight of being the Red Sox’ ace, it would be Baird and Bannister. Moreover, they would stand as good a chance as anyone to sell Greinke on coming here.\nDombrowski is expected to hold meetings this week with the organization’s pro scouts, at which point he will “set our working list on who we want to specifically target.” If the targets require a sizable financial commitment from Henry, Dombrowski said he’ll “be sitting down with ownership to discuss those kinds of things.”\nBut Dombrowski also figures to delve into the trade market, perhaps cashing in a few chips from a minor league system ranked by most outsiders as one of baseball’s best. The Indians could decide to deal from their collection of starters, including right-handers Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar , while the A’s might be willing to move 26-year-old stud Sonny Gray , especially since they’re unlikely to contend before his salary escalates through arbitration.\nManny being . . . mentor?\nOne of the strangest sights from the NL Championship Series was Manny Ramirez , clad in a Cubs hoodie and uniform pants, chatting with young sluggers Jorge Soler and Javier Baez in left field before Game 1.\nTechnically, Ramirez isn’t part of manager Joe Maddon ’s coaching staff. Maddon calls him a “cultural coach,” and that’s as close as you’ll get to a title for the enigmatic former Sox slugger who hit 555 career homers but was suspended twice after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.\n“The fact that we have so many young Hispanic players, to have Manny here to validate a lot of the stuff we’re talking about really helps. Not a little, but a lot,” said Maddon, who cited Ramirez’ work with Soler and shortstop-turned-second baseman Starlin Castro . “He’s really in tune to the mental side of hitting, and I love that. I love having him here. He’s a positive, upbeat kind of guy.” . . .\nIf slugger Kyle Schwarber had been off the board when the Cubs made the fourth overall pick in last year’s draft, they probably would’ve taken Oregon State outfielder Michael Conforto , who went 10th overall to the Mets. Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein personally scouted Conforto and said, “We liked him a lot.” Like Schwarber, Conforto made his major league debut this season.\nThe Wright stuff\nMost people thought third baseman David Wright was nuts in December 2012 for signing an eight-year, $138 million extension to stay with the Mets in the midst of a six-season stretch in which they averaged 86 losses.\nIt’s nice to see Wright’s loyalty rewarded.\n“I had faith in these starting pitchers that were being hyped so much,” Wright said, referring to Matt Harvey , Jacob deGrom , Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz . “I truly believed that this organization was going to turn it around and that I wanted to be a part of that.”\nFrom goat to Mets hero\nLegend has it, the Cubs wouldn’t allow local tavern owner Bill Sianis to bring his pet goat into Wrigley Field for Game 4 of the 1945 World Series. Sianis, incensed, declared the Cubs would never win another championship.\nThe goat’s name: Murphy.\n“Is that the name of the goat?” Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy asked incredulously, 70 years later, during an NLCS in which he went 9-for-17 and homered in all four games to deny the Cubs a pennant. “Is that what it is?”\nFor real, Daniel. You can’t make this stuff up.", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Greinke+fits+Sox%E2%80%99+bill+but+he%E2%80%99d+have+to+solve+aversion+to+spotlight+"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:25:45.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
