A pass from quarterback Cameron Hamilton to Grant Reuter, combined with a run from fullback Harrison Smith, and a successful two point conversion made it 14-0 Bulldogs at the end of the first. \nThe Vikings had their best chance to mount a comeback in the second quarter when Wareham recovered a fumble on Old Rochester's 15 yard line. The Vikings capitalized on it quickly. Senior quarterback Stephen Toal's short pass met with Josh Onujiogu in the end zone. The kick was good from sophomore Legend Fernandes making the score 14-7. \nOld Rochester immediatley responded back. Their kick-off return team executed timely blocks allowing Mike McAllister to run back the return from the Bulldog's own 23 yard line. ORR got more points on the board with a pass from Hamilton to Isiah Gomes. The Bulldogs led 27-7 at the half. \nThe Vikings had a steady offense in the second half of the game. However, interceptions and fumbles proved costly for Wareham. Old Rochester secured the ball much better, scoring again in the third quarter with a three yard run from Hamilton. \nQuarterback Toal got some points on the board for the Vikings in the fourth quarter, on a play-action bootle he scored an 8 yard run. The Bulldogs got some final insurance points with a 44 yard run from Smith and a successful kick from Dias added seven more points to the scoreboard to close out the game. \nCoach Dan Nault said of his squad, “We were not doing the little things, it came back to bite us.” \nNault praised the commitment of his players throughout the year, saying they started training immediately after the school year ended last June, went to camps, and practiced during the summer, “So for them it's hard losing, it's hard when you start losing games when you put all that work in.” \nWareham's next match up is an away game against Division II Dighton-Rehoboth at 7 p.m. on Friday, October 23rd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:48:16.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
