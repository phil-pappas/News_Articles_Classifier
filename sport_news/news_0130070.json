The school has not received the grant-in-aid of Rs 1.75 crore committed to it for maintenance and restoration of the palatial building. The parents of nearly 275 cadets of Punjab studying here too have been awaiting fee reimbursement to the tune of nearly Rs 50 lakh for the last three sessions. The boarding school has not been getting any facility, including the diet money of Rs 58 per child per day, for the last three years. Parents say other state governments were extending timely subsidies to students of their state. But Punjab students, which comprise 67 per cent of the present strength of the 609 cadets, have failed to get any government assistance. Shobha Singh, a representative of parents, said, “Punjab has just one Sainik School whereas Haryana and Bihar have two Sainik Schools, which are being fully supported by the respective state governments. The Punjab Government, on the other hand, has been giving a cold shoulder to the Sainik School. It hasn’t even revised the income slabs for scholarship eligibility since 2003-04. Even the diet money that the other states have been getting is higher (about Rs 75 per child per day).” The school staff said many portions of the building, which houses the palace of the erstwhile Maharaja of Kapurthala, had already started falling off as they have no maintenance funds. Teachers said the school had long received a letter regarding the allocation of Rs 1 crore for the maintenance of the building but the amount had not reached so far. He further lamented, “There are many economically weak parents, who had been depending on the scholarship scheme for studies of their ward. There are some children without father, who have been borrowing money from their relatives to pay Rs 28,000 annual fee for the last three years. I really feel helpless for these children and parents when they come to me. As the last resort, we will now have to go on a hunger strike to get the attention of the government.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:08:12.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
