Green Bay. With two more home games and a road trip to San Francisco, the Packers should be sitting 6-Â­0 when they head into their bye.\n2. New England. Tom Brady has thrown 133 consecutive passes to open the season without an interception. Good things happen when a quarterback doesn't turn the ball over.\n3. Arizona. Eight-Â­time Pro Bowl WR Larry Fitzgerald caught only two touchdowns passes last season. But he's bouncing back big time in 2015 with an NFLÂ­-leading five TDs catches through September.\n4. Denver. This has to be a first -- a Peyton Manning team ranks last in the AFC in offense. But the Broncos remain unbeaten because they lead the NFL in defense.\n5. Cincinnati. The Bengals have the only offense in the NFL that ranks in the top 10 in passing and rushing. Overall, Cincinnati ranks No. 2 in offense.\n6. Atlanta. The best receiver in the NFL? My vote goes to Julio Jones, who has three consecutive 100-Â­yard games and four touchdowns to open the season.\n7. Carolina. Held to one sack in each of their last two games, both at home, the Panthers took a step to dial up the pass rush this week with the acquisition of DE Jared Allen.\n8. Buffalo. There were 13 running backs selected in the 2015 draft ahead of Karlos Williams in the fifth round. But he became the first rookie to rush for 100 yards in a game this season for the Bills.\n9. Minnesota. Adrian Peterson now has 100-Â­yard rushing games in his last two outings, both Minnesota victories. He's the only back in the NFL with two 100-Â­yard games this season.\n10. Pittsburgh. With Ben Roethlisberger out indefinitely, the Steelers become the fourth NFL team that's been forced to replace an injured Pro Bowl quarterback this season.\n11. Oakland. Derek Carr has passed for 665 yards and two touchdowns in his last two games, both victories for the 2Â­-1 Raiders.\n12. Seattle. The first back to rush for 100 yards in a game for the Seahawks this season wasn't Marshawn Lynch. It was undrafted rookie free agent Thomas Rawls last weekend.\n13. Dallas. Brandon Weeden is 0Â­-2 in his career as a starting quarterback for the Cowboys, who now have Matt Cassel warming up in the bullpen.\n14. NY Jets. The NFL plays three games in London this season. The first this weekend pits the Jets and Dolphins. This is Miami's fourth appearance in London, the first for the Jets.\n15. Houston. J.J. Watt has only three sacks in three games. But he had only two sacks through three weeks a year ago and still wound up with 20 1â„2.\n16. NY Giants. The Giants have allowed a 300-Â­yard passer in each of their first three games: Tony Romo, Matt Ryan and Kirk Cousins. Little wonder the NYG rank last in the NFL in pass defense.\n17. Indianapolis. Wonder why the Colts are scuffling along at 1Â­-2? Andrew Luck has thrown a league high seven interceptions and also lost a fumble -- eight turnovers in three games.\n18. Kansas City. The Chiefs travel to Cincinnati Sunday -- the third consecutive weekend they face an unbeaten team. KC played Denver and Green Bay the previous two weekends.\n19. Philadelphia. The Chip Kelly offense doesn't spend much time on the field. The Eagles have a league-Â­low time of possession of 24 minutes, six seconds this season.\n20. Miami. There have been only 16 100-Â­yard rushing games in the NFL this season and the Dolphins have allowed two of them. Where's the NFL's best DT Ndamukong Suh?\n21. Washington. Kirk Cousins has thrown three TD passes thus far -- all were exactly four yards in length to three different receivers. It's time to work on stretching the field a bit.\n22. St. Louis. The Rams share the NFL lead with 13 sacks -- and the 13th sack put Pro Bowl quarterback Ben Roethlisberger on the injured list.\n23. San Diego. The Chargers sacked Detroit's Matthew Stafford in the second quarter of the season opener but have failed to get to the quarterback in 72 pass attempts since then.\n24. Tennessee. This is the week the NFL has incorporated the byes into the schedule and the first two teams to sit are the Titans and defending Super Bowl champion Patriots.\n25. Jacksonville. Former Penn State LBs rank 1-Â­2 in the NFL in tackles this week -- Paul Posluszny with 34 for the Jaguars and Sean Lee with 33 for the Cowboys.\n26. Cleveland. The Browns need to load up on stick 'um for games. They have fumbled an NFL-high eight times this season and lost a leagueÂ­-high five of them.\n27. Tampa Bay. How talented is the Buffalo defense? The Bills discarded DE Jacquies Smith in September 2014. He was claimed off waivers by the Bucs and now leads the NFL with four sacks.\n28. San Francisco. Where have you gone Joe Montana and Steve Young? The 49ers are the lowest scoring team in the NFL with just 45 points.\n29. Baltimore. The Ravens are the most penalized team in the NFL with 33 for 218 yards.\n30. Detroit. The Lions are winless and face a daunting task these next two weekends. They travel to Seattle this weekend and then host the unbeaten Cardinals the next.\n31. Chicago. The fire sale has begun in Chicago where the Bears are winless. DE Jared Allen has been dealt to Carolina, LB Jon Bostic to Pats. Who's next out the door, RB Matt Forte?\n32. New Orleans. The Saints went winless in September -- their second 0-Â­3 start in four years. New Orleans also started off 2012 0-Â­4 on the way to a 7-Â­9 finish.\nMore Cowboys coverage Latest news, opinion, analysis\nGeorge: Why Cowboys' run defense went from dominant to dormant in one week\nGosselin: Cowboys need NFL's best offensive line to live up to reputation\nDid Brandon Weeden's preseason concussion lead to the trade for Matt Cassel?\nDallas Cowboys practice report Wednesday: CB Brandon Carr absent; LG Ron Leary, DE Jeremy Mincey participating\nGeorge: Cowboys' OL not playing up to expectations, but what's the reason?\nGeorge: Not much difference between Weeden, Cassel; it'll be struggle until Romo returns\nSaints coach Sean Payton gives update on injured QB Drew Brees ahead of tilt vs. Cowboys\nRick Gosselin's NFL rankings: How far have Cowboys dropped behind ... the Raiders?\nEx-NFL exec: Cowboys shouldn't hesitate to draft a QB in first round\nGeorge: When does Dez return?
