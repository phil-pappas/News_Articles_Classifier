(Photo: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports) \nEach week, Reno Gazette-Journal sports writer Chris Murray will take a look at Nevada’s opponent. Here’s a look at Hawaii, which the Wolf Pack hosts at 1 p.m. Saturday at Mackay Stadium. \nHawaii \nCoach: Norm Chow (10-34 overall, 4-23 league in four seasons) \nConference: Mountain West \nSeries history: Nevada leads, 11-8 \nLast game: Nevada won, 26-18, on Oct. 25, 2014 (in Honolulu) Polian: 'There was no leadership' in loss to Wyoming \nHawaii on offense: Chow was an excellent offensive coordinator but his teams at Hawaii have struggled to score. The Warriors average 16.6 ppg, the third worst in the nation, and 289 yards per game, the second worst in the nation. Hawaii’s quarterbacks have completed just 46 percent of their passes for six touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Hawaii has only one running back with more than 200 yards, and that’s Paul Harris with 421 yards (5.5 ypc). Hawaii has only one receiver with more than 300 yards, and that’s Marcus Kemp (20 catches for 325 yards). The Warriors rank 109 in third-down conversion percentage (out of 127 teams) and 126th in fourth-down conversion percentage. They also possess the ball for just 23 minutes, 54 seconds per game, the second worst mark in the nation, and have 16 turnovers, which ranks sixth worst in the nation. Simply put, this unit has struggled all season. \nHawaii on defense: The Hawaii defense is better than its offense, although it has still allowed 32 ppg, which is 10th out of 12 MW teams. The Warriors have gone to a more basic defense with less blitzes and less exotic looks, which has limited big plays allowed and created. Hawaii has struggled against the run as opponents average 226.6 rushing yards per game, although foes average 4.3 yards per carry, which isn’t a bad figure. Hawaii’s pass defense has been better, although it has only one interception on the year (and just seven turnovers created in seven games). Junior DE Kennedy Tulimasealii, a former top-300 national recruit, is the team’s best defensive player. He has 35 tackles, including 8.5 for loss, as well as 2.5 sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Hawaii has 11 sacks and 39 tackles for loss, so it hasn’t gotten a ton of pressure on the backfield. This unit has its vulnerabilities. \nKey matchup: Nevada pass defense vs. Hawaii quarterback: Hawaii is averaging just 3.3 yards per carry and while the passing game isn’t much better, if the Warriors are going to upset the Pack, it’s going to happen through the air where Nevada is vulnerable. Hawaii’s starter at quarterback is unknown as Max Wittek (knee), a USC transfer, didn’t play last week. His replacement, Ikaika Woolsey, played last week. Both have struggled, but whichever one starts will have to play well against Nevada for a Hawaii win. \nDid you know? Nevada became the first mainland team to play at Hawaii in 1920, winning 14-0. The game was played on Christmas Day and it took seven days for Nevada to get to the islands as Nevada boarded the S.S. Maui on Dec. 15 in San Francisco (it actually practiced on the ship). It was the first intercollegiate game in Hawaii’s history, in any sport, as it had previously just played local high schools. \nOne famous sports alum: Nick Rolovich — We’ll go with Rolovich, the former Hawaii quarterback who is now the offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach at Nevada. Rolovich had an epic senior season, going 8-1 and throwing for 3,361 yards and 34 touchdowns in nine games. In a win over BYU that season, Rolovich threw for 543 yards and eight touchdowns. He got into NFL camp and played in the AFL.
