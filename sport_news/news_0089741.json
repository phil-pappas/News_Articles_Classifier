(Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) Glenn Graham Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun \nThe No. 1 McDonogh girls soccer team didn't have to deal with much adversity in comfortably winning its first nine games this season. \nSome was expected when the Eagles visited No. 11 Notre Dame Prep on Wednesday in a rematch of last year's tightly contested Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland A Conference title game. And then even more came when Metro Player of the Year Bridgette Andrzejewski was issued a red card early in the first half. \nThe Eagles handled it all just fine. \nAll-Metro senior forward Kia Rankin scored a few minutes after Andrzejewski was ejected, junior Kori Locksley added an insurance goal early in the second half and the Eagles controlled play throughout in coming away with a resilient 2-0 win over the Blazers. \nMcDonogh, which went 15-0 to claim last year's title, finishes the regular season with a 10-0 mark and went 6-0 in the league to earn a bye in the opening round of the league playoffs. The Eagles, who outscored their six league opponents by a 47-2 margin, will open their quest to repeat in the semifinal round next Thursday. Andrzejewski, who was sent off on Wednesday for elbowing an opponent inside the penalty area prior to a free kick, will be out of the lineup serving a one-game suspension.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:41:54.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
