Until now, only archery deer season has been open. \nGeorgia’s deer season from Saturday through Friday is called the Special Opportunity Season, and it allows kids 15 and younger and disabled hunters to hunt with modern firearms a full week before the regular modern firearms deer season opens. The Special Opportunity regulations do not apply to archery-only counties across metro Atlanta. \nThis week is also the primitive-weapons season, when hunters using muzzleloading rifles can take deer. Archery gear is legal every day of deer season from the archery opener until the firearms deer closes Jan. 10. \nAs always, before any type of hunting, check the official regulations available online at www.georgiawildlife.com/hunting/regulations. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:19:21.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
