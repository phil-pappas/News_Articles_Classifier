Jeff Merkley, who was born in Douglas County and lived in Roseburg as a young child, said he never expected a tragedy like this to happen in Roseburg.\n\"I guess we continued to be educated that a tragedy like this can happen anywhere,\" said Merkley, D-Ore. \"I can't imagine it.\"\nThe area, he said, \"was an incredible, ideal place in the world,\" with beautiful rivers and \"just the right size community where everybody knows each other.\"\n\"I think about how if my path was a little different, my kids might have been at that community college. ... It's just shocking to me.\"\nMerkley said that he had talked to two Douglas County commissioners and said he would provide whatever help his office could.\n\"I'm confident that the hearts and prayers of every Oregonian are with the victims and families of that community,\" he said.\n-- Jeff Mapes\njmapes@oregonian.com\n503-221-8209 @Jeffmapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:04:11.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
