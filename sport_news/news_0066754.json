The largest single-day coho count at Locks occurred on Sept. 5 when 566 were tallied.\nThe chinook return was 5,477 through Sept. 27 and no fish returned since Sept. 25. The 10-year historical average is 11,442 through Oct. 2. In good years it is normal to see around 30,000-plus chinook return to the lake.\n\nDaily counts were zero from Oct. 2 to Sept. 26; seven on Sept. 25; seven on Sept. 24; zero on Sept. 23; seven on Sept. 22; seven on Sept. 21; zero on Sept. 20; seven on Sept. 19; seven on Sept. 18; 11 on Sept. 17; zero on Sept. 16; 20 on Sept. 15; 66 on Sept. 14; 66 on Sept. 13; and 70 on Sept. 12.\nThe largest single-day chinook count at Locks occurred on Sept. 6 when 285 were tallied.\nBill Robinson, a member of the Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) Cedar River HCP Oversight Committee Member, said the prespawn mortality on the sockeye at Landsburg and the hatchery has been significantly lower than in previous yeas. Robinson says this is due to the use of antibiotics and peroxide treatments at the hatchery.\nThe chinook spawning below the weir is, at this point, five redds, which is very good for chinook in the Cedar and does not complicate the collection of sockeye at the weir.\n“It has been good for chinook returning to the Cedar,” he said. “The SPU and (state Fish and Wildlife) staff have operated the tip gate at the weir almost all fall to pass the chinook without handling them which is a good thing. The sockeye which are passed along with the chinook, while not collected for the hatchery, do contribute to the naturally spawning population in the Cedar.”\nThe Landsburg fish ladder data on the Cedar River in Renton near the I-405 overpass showed 652 sockeye (278 female and 374 male). Single-day trap counts showed 46 on Oct. 15; 91 on Oct. 8; 137 on Oct. 1; 193 on Sept. 24; and 185 on Sept. 17.\nAt the Landsburg Hatchery a total of 2,227,000 sockeye eggs have been collected through Oct. 18. A total of 2,885 sockeye have hauled with 1,137 spawned (482 male and 655 female).\nChinook counts at the fish ladder totaled 254 fish (83 female and 171 male). Single-day trap counts showed 55 on Oct. 15; 44 on Oct. 8; 83 on Oct. 1; 52 on Sept. 24; and 20 on Sept. 17.\nCoho counts at the fish ladder totaled 83 fish (38 female and 45 male). Single-day trap counts showed 49 on Oct. 15; 23 on Oct. 8; eight on Oct. 1; three on Sept. 24; and none on Sept. 17.\n \nMark Yuasa : 206-464-8780 or myuasa@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @markkyuasa .
