They want to hold opponents to under 91 points, under 43 percent overall shooting and under 35 percent shooting from beyond the arc. \n\"I realize those are lofty goals, but we're not that far from them,\" Skiles said at the shootaround. \nAt the time, Skiles was correct. In their first three preseason games, the Magic allowed teams to score 100.0 points per game, make 43.5 percent of their overall shot attempts and connect on 34.2 percent of their 3-point tries. A large share of opponents' points stemmed from ill-advised Magic fouls. \nSunday night, however, should temper the Magic's optimism. \nNik Vucevic was one reason why the Magic were within sight of their defensive goals when Sunday began. Although it's too early to draw firm conclusions, Vucevic appears to be less of a defensive hindrance now than he was in the scheme employed by coach Jacque Vaughn. \nVucevic isn't an explosive leaper and never will be a dominant shot-blocker, but Skiles thinks the 7-foot-tall center can be effective in the system, which emphasizes defenders' proper positioning. \n\"I think I've made improvements by talking to Coach and watching film, just buying into whatever he asks us to do,\" Vucevic said before Sunday's tipoff. \"The more you do it, the more comfortable you feel with it. Once everybody gets on that same page, I think our defense will be very good. I think I've made improvements. \n\"I try to get to spots early, and it makes it so much easier once I'm there earlier and we talk and we communicate. Somebody's going to have my back, and I'm going to be in the right spot. If I'm late, then the guy behind me is going to be late, and it messes up everything. So I'm trying to really pay attention to that and try to get better.\" \nVucevic turned the ball over three times Sunday. Early in the first quarter, after a Houston made basket, Vucevic nonchalantly inbounded the ball toward Victor Oladipo, and Oladipo didn't run back to collect the ball. \nTy Lawson sprinted forward, caught the ball after it bounced and sank a 3-pointer from the left corner. \nIt was the kind of unfocused play that was emblematic of the entire team's unfocused first-half performance. \nHouston likely would've piled on more points, but All-Star James Harden sustained a right-knee contusion late in the second quarter as he sprinted back on a fastbreak and contested a layup by Evan Fournier. Harden, who already had scored 12 points, didn't return to the game. \nThe Magic looked more energetic on defense in the second half. In the third quarter, they held the Rockets to 26.7 percent shooting. But Lawson and Trevor Ariza played limited minutes in the final two periods. \nAnd now the Magic can look forward to Nov. 4. \nThat's the day early in the regular season when they'll face the Rockets again. \nIt's another reminder that time's running out for the Magic to make true progress. \njrobbins@orlandosentinel.com .
