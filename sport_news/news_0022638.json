Assimilation through receiving is a characteristic of Indian society. Our collective strength must be harnessed to resist evil powers in society,” Mukherjee said. At a function, Mukherjee asked: “Whether tolerance and acceptance of dissent are on the wane? “The essential part of the Indian civilisation and culture is its pluralism. Our bond is strong because of tolerance — to accept the other’s religion and other’s opinion,” the President added. “Indian civilisation has survived for 5,000 years because of its tolerance. It has always accepted dissent and differences. A large number of languages, 1,600 dialects and seven religions coexist in India. We have a constitution that accommodates all these differences,” he said. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:21:53.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
