(Courtesy photo) \nOWINGS MILLS — As a freshman, Key School's Delaney Snowden has three more years to score some big goals for her team. \nNone will most likely be bigger than the goal she scored on Saturday. \nSnowden scored on a stroke with 4 minutes, 55 seconds left for the only goal of the game in Key's 1-0 victory over St. Timothy's in the Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland C Conference final at Garrison Forest. \nKey (6-4-1) won its first ever field hockey championship and the second girls sports championship, following the indoor soccer team's title last year. The Obezags fell to St. Timothy's in last year's final. \n\"I just didn't want to miss, because then we could lose,\" Snowden said. \"I just put it in the left side where I always put it.\" \nSnowden was awarded the stroke when it was ruled a St. Timothy's defender used her foot to prevent a goal. She went low and to the left to beat goalie Asia Boateng. \n\"It's amazing,\" Snowden said. \"I don't really know what else to say.\" \nFollowing a loss in last year's championship game, the Obezags returned just one senior, Brandi Ginn, and fielded a team that included six freshmen and four sophomores. They went 4-4-1 during the regular season, which included a split of their two games with St. Timothy's. They defeated Mercy, 1-0, on Wednesday to advance to the final. \n\"This feels so amazing,\" Ginn said. \"Last year we were in the championship and we had a great team, but we lost and it was just so heartbreaking. This year, we came back and we just knew what our goal was. We came to play and we came to win.\" \nIn a game that seemed destined to go to overtime for a second straight year, neither team posed serious offensive threats for most of the game. Key goalie Kaelyn Gurka came out to challenge and denied a threat following a penalty corner with nine minutes left, while Key's Julia Mahoney helped create the pressure that led to Key getting awarded the stroke. \n\"I think that our sophomore class really took on a role of learning and wanting to be a part of the team,\" said Key first-year coach Meredith Andrews, who played at Seton Keough and Washington College. \"Our captains Sydney (Wilkerson), Julia (Mahoney) and Brandi (Ginn) really stepped up and kept the team really positive on and off the field.\" \nWhen the teams met in last year's final, Gurka made a stop on a penalty stroke in overtime to keep the game scoreless. The teams remained scoreless through overtime, but St. Tim's won the title when it converted all four of its one-on-one opportunities. Key left the field proud of its accomplishment in getting to the final, but wanted to take the next step this year. \nGiven that opportunity late, Snowden made sure overtime would not be needed this year. \n\"Delaney has such a great work ethic. She plays year-round, so we're very lucky to have her,\" Andrews said. \"She has the skill, but she wants to learn more. She listens, and that's what a coach wants.\" \nKey (6-4-1)01—1St. Timothy's (6-4)00—0 \nGOALS: K — Snowden. SAVES: K — Gurka 2; ST — Boateng 2. SHOTS: K — 5; ST — 4.
