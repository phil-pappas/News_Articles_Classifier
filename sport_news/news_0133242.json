Mandatory Credit: Ben Queen-USA TODAY Sports ** Usable by SD ONLY ** (Ben Queen / USA Today Sports) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Carroll County Times Caleb Rowe immediately re-watched his four interception day on the ride home from WVU. \nMaryland's 45-6 loss to West Virginia was still fresh in Caleb Rowe's mind as he boarded the team bus for the ride back home from Morgantown, along the dark and windy roads of Western Maryland. \nIt was a performance to forget featuring four interceptions and plenty of poor decisions for the redshirt junior, but he relived it right away. \nOffensive coordinator Mike Locksley pulled Rowe aside, and the pair re-watched the game together on an iPad as the bus made its way back to College Park. Rowe said he watched it about five times before the team started meetings this week, and once again, the theme from Rowe and Locksley is the same: If Maryland wants to compete against No. 22 Michigan in this week's Big Ten Conference opener, the Terps will need Rowe to make smart choices and take care of the ball. \n\"I think it was good, just having that one-on-one with Coach Locks,\" Rowe said Wednesday. \"Just immediately trying to get better and getting ready for Michigan. â€¦ He was able to help make the corrections, and it really kind of bugged me the whole bus ride. I'm really kind of trying to focus in on what my job is and not trying to do too much.\" \n\"Not trying to do too much\" has come to define Rowe this season in College Park. He's appeared in all four games this season and thrown at least two interceptions in three of those appearances, and his nine picks are the most in the Football Bowl Subdivision. He has the mentality of a \"gunslinger,\" but that sometimes leads to reckless play and bad mistakes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:01:16.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
