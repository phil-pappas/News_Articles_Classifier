That's why the Highlanders are one of four teams left standing in the Bergen County boys soccer tournament. \nSparked by second-half goals from Sam Moscowitz and Christian Virgona, Northern Highlands rallied from a one-goal halftime deficit to defeat second-seeded Bergen Tech, 2-1, in a quarterfinal game Sunday. \n\"We knew Bergen Tech was a very dangerous team, but we also have a lot of confidence in our own abilities,\" said Virgona, a junior wing. \"Everyone maintained their faith that we would be able to mount a comeback. We can get behind in games, but we never feel we're out of it.\" \nKenny Gwon, fighting an injury, scored off an assist from Simran Gill to give Bergen Tech (10-2) the early advantage 17:33 into the first half. The Knights had several other good opportunities — a couple of booming shots clanged off the near and far posts and bounced away harmlessly — and Highlanders senior goalie Jase Barrack also came up with some big stops. \n\"We're a young team [five sophomores, three juniors]. We played hard and this is a good learning experience for our team,\" Bergen Tech veteran coach Nelson Ramirez said. \"This is the farthest we've ever gone in this tournament and we had some chances, but give Highlands credit. They made the big plays when they needed them.\" \nThe Knights had edged Cliffside Park, 1-0, in the round of 16 on Oct. 11. And they looked as if they might be headed for another big victory, but Northern Highlands had different ideas about how the second half would go. Applying good pressure in the first several minutes, the 10th-seeded Highlanders (11-2), who have won seven straight games, finally broke through with 27:57 left. That's when Teli Meneve came up with a big throw-in from the left sideline and found Moscowitz crossing down the middle. A senior midfielder, Moscowitz tapped it in from 5 feet to deadlock the game at 1. \n\"We inserted him [Meneve] into the game in the second half and he made a huge impact,\" said Northern Highlands coach Steve Every. \"We just kind of picked up the pace and tried to dictate our style more over the second half, and we were also able to overcome the [cold] weather conditions and finally prevail in the end.\" \nMatthew Vaccari sent in a cross that was volleyed in by Virgona for the winning goal with 6:11 remaining. \nNorthern Highlands had toppled seventh-seeded Waldwick, 1-0, in the round of 16. \nRAMAPO 1, DON BOSCO 0 (at Ramsey): Charlie Ortiz scored off an assist from Noah Kilday with 18:54 left in the first half and the fourth-seeded Green Raiders (11-1) made it hold up against the Ironmen (8-5). \nSenior Colin Nelson made seven saves for the shutout. Ramapo is the defending champion and has won the tournament two of the last three years. \nStrong defensive work by seniors Justin Chi and Dylan Rocchio, junior Billy Collins and sophomore Sebastian Varela helped hold the potent Don Bosco attack at bay. \n\"All 26 players on this team have accepted and fulfilled their roles, and that's been a major positive for us,\" Ramapo coach Evan Baumgarten said. \"We needed everyone out there to contribute as much as we could, and that's what we got today, a very inspired all-around effort.\" \nGoalkeepers William Shim (four) and Moritz Eisold (four) combined for eight saves for Don Bosco. Eisold has gradually increased his playing time since returning from a lower back injury a few games ago. \nTENAFLY 2, GARFIELD 1, OT, (at Ramsey): Romero Morales scored from 25 yards 17 seconds into sudden-death overtime to spark the third-seeded Tigers (9-1-2) past the sixth-seeded Boilermakers (9-3-2). \nOfek Nahar scored 15:30 into the first half to give Tenafly a 1-0 lead, then Jorge Salas scored off an assist from Dave Herrera in the second half to tie it for Garfield. Egi Zyfi of Garfield and Tim Nehila of Tenafly each made six saves in net. \nHudson County \nKEARNY 3, HARRISON 0 (at Bayonne): John Najarro scored two goals to lead the top-seeded Kardinals past the fourth-seeded Blue Tide in the Hudson semifinals. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:28:47.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
