The victim, Matt Keith, who was with his girlfriend Emily, was forced to write an apology letter by the local police for “intentionally spreading hatred” before they were allowed to go. Narrating the incident on Facebook, Keith claimed that they were “illegally detained” by the police after the “vicious assault by BJP members”. The incident has triggered a furore with the Australian government expressing concern. However, Keith, in his latest post on Facebook, has expressed satisfaction with the support he received here. The incident occurred on Saturday when Keith, a law student from Melbourne, and his girlfriend went to a restaurant, where a group of local BJP leaders, including Ramesh Yadav, took objection to Keith having a tattoo of the goddess, Yellamma, on his shin. The incident led to a commotion and the police were informed about it. The couple and their “persecutors” were taken to the Ashok Nagar police station where the duo was released after Keith wrote an apology letter. Yadav, the local BJP leader, claimed that they were only concerned about the couple’s safety as they were flaunting the tattoo. “We requested the police to ask them to cover their body,” he said. Bengaluru Deputy Commissioner of Police Sandeep Patil said though the Australian couple had not filed a complaint so far, the police would act against Yadav and his associates if found guilty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:15:40.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
