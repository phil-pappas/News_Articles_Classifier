(Tim Ireland | The Associated Press) Comments \nLondon â€” There wasn't a big pre-game speech or any added emphasis in meeting rooms. For the most part, Doug Marrone, who opted out of his contract as the head coach of the Buffalo Bills in January and became the offensive line coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, prepared for the Bills' game against the Jaguars in London like it was any other week. \nIt's tough to imagine Marrone wasn't smiling a bit extra when the Jaguars walked off the field at Wembley Stadium with a 34-31 win over his former team, though. \n\"He didn't say anything,\" Jaguars offensive tackle Luke Joeckel said. \"He din't want to make it about himself or anything like that. It's all about us getting better every single day. He's a great coach. He's great with detail. He was kind of the same way. He coached the same way he coached every other week.\" \nBefore the game, Marrone didn't spent much time on the field at Wembley Stadium. He didn't catch up with old players or coaches. He spent 10 minutes on the field and returned to the locker room. Some Bills players admitted to wanting to stick it to the coach that left them, but Jaguars players felt that same thing from Marrone, even if he didn't say it. \n\"I think it definitely meant a lot to him,\" Jaguars center Stefen Wisniewski said. \"You know, he's got obviously a lot of ties to that team. You always want to win against a team you used to work for or play for, absolutely.\" \nMaybe more important than the added motivation was Marrone's knowledge of the Bills' personnel. He knew a lot about Buffalo's players and made himself available for anyone who had questions. \n\"He did,\" Joeckel said. \"He coached those guys and spent a couple years with those guys. He know their pass rush moves and all of that kind of stuff. You know, he knew their attitudes and stuff like that. That's good insight to have.\" \nMarrone's offensive line wasn't perfect. The group allowed two sacks and three hits, and Bortles was under a fair amount of pressure. Still, it was enough for the Jaguars to pull out a win, and while some players could see it more than others, there was something extra about it. \n\"It's hard to tell, but we try to attack every single week the same way,\" Joeckel said. \"We try to put pressure on ourselves to be our best and all that, but I don't think he attacked it any other way than normal. It felt good beating that team because he was there last year. It feels good.\" \nEven the defensive players who aren't around him every day got a sense for what the game meant to Marrone. More importantly, though, the Jaguars just needed a win. \n\"Doug wouldn't say it, but we wanted to get this win, and the main thing is we finally got it,\" Jaguars defensive end Andre Branch said. \"I know Doug's happy about it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:18:53.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
