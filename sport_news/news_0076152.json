(AP) - Adam Henrique scored twice and added an assist and the New Jersey Devils won their fourth straight with a 4-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night. \nMike Cammalleri had a goal and two assists, and David Schlemko also scored for the Devils. New Jersey hasn't lost since starting the season 0-3-1. \nTyler Ennis, Ryan O'Reilly and Jack Eichel scored for Buffalo. Goaltender Linus Ullmark made his NHL debut for the Sabres (2-6-0). \nBuffalo lost Evander Kane to a left knee injury midway through the third period. A high-profile addition last season, Kane needed to be helped off the ice and did not return. Coach Dan Bylsma did not have an update on Kane's condition. \nCammalleri's goal tied it 2-2 8:57 into the second, and then Schlemko put New Jersey ahead with 49 seconds left in the period.
