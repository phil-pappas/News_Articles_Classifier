Goalkeeper Phillip Martin made 1 save to earn the clean sheet. \nThe Lancers had entered Monday’s game on a six-game unbeaten run, allowing one goal during that span. \nLast Wednesday, Sept. 30, Montclair also defeated Newark Academy, 2-1. Reece Bordick and Amani Marshall had the goals, while Martin made 3 saves. \nMHS hosted state power Seton Hall Prep Wednesday afternoon after The Times went to press, and will travel down the Shore to play Ocean Township this Saturday morning, Oct. 10. \nThe recent hot streak should propel the Mounties to an expected top-four seed in the upcoming Essex County Tournament, which will be seeded this Tuesday, Oct. 13. The Round of 16, where Montclair will enter the fray, is scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 21. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:17:41.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
