Johan Cruyff would have been proud of that finish. \nAnd one minute later, United were undone again, this time Theo Walcott laying on a perfect pass for Ozil to steer home, and send the Emirates into raptures. \nThe Gunners were three to the good in under 20 minutes, after Sanchez rode the half-hearted challenge of a hapless Matteo Darmian, before rifling an unstoppable strike into the top corner, leaving David de Gea no chance. \nUnited huffed and puffed but that opening 20 minutes of madness settled this encounter, with Petr Cech making several fine saves to preserve the Gunners' clean sheet. \nDespite supposedly being in “crisis”, the result sees Arsenal leapfrog United on goal difference, and the Gunners are just two points behind leaders Manchester City. The title race is well and truly on. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
