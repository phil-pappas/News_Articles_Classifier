In view of the security concerns, voting time has been curtailed by one hour and two hours in as many as 23 Constituencies.\nAdditional chief electoral officer R Lakshamanan said that while voting would start at 7am in all 32 constituencues it would end at 3pm in 11 constituencies and at 4pm at 12 others. Only 9 seats would have scheduled voting from 7am to 5pm.\nA total of 86,13,870 electors are expected to decide the fate of 456 candidates, 32 out of whom are women. There are 9,119 polling stations.\nA total of 993 companies of Central Para Military forces and state police would be deployed on the day to ensure peaceful voting.\nAs many as 334 companies would be in service in Gaya, 201 in Rohtas and 193 in Aurangabad.\nWhile contest on all the seats is intense, the battle at Imamganj (reserved SC seat) would be keenly watched where former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi of HAM is locked in a straight contest with the Speaker of the outgoing assembly Uday Narain Chaudhary of JD(U). Chaudhary is a five-term MLA from the seat.\nManjhi is also trying his luck from Makhdumpur seat in Jehanabad too.\nSenior BJP leader and former minister Prem Kumar (Gaya town), former state unit chief of the saffron party Gopal Narayan Singh (Nabinagar) and state minister Jay Kumar Singh (Dinara) are among those whose fate would be decided in this phase.
