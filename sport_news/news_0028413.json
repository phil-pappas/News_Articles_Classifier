Some were obvious. Some you looked past initially. Some were hidden on draft night.\nYou knew you would have to go two games without Le’Veon Bell. In retrospect, Adrian Peterson’s inconsistency makes sense for someone coming off a year-long suspension. Some fantasy pundits have been forecasting the injury or production decline of Marshawn Lynch for years. Jamaal Charles drew the short straw in the devastating injury sweepstakes. Even untouchable Antonio Brown has been touched by the loss of Ben Roethlisberger.\nIf there was one safe play on draft day, it was Eddie Lacy — a three-down back who got goal-line carries on the league’s best offense. And then the season happened.\nLacy twisted his ankle against Seattle in Week 2, but fantasy owners breathed a sigh of relief when he returned the next week. Yet his production hasn’t reached expected levels. But that was going to change this week, when the Packers faced the Chargers — whom fantasy backs have feasted on this season.\nAnd then the game happened. James Starks got the start — wait … what?!? — and on the second drive he ripped off a 65-yard touchdown run. If the “hot hand” theory was in play, which it seemed to be, then Lacy’s fantasy day was all but over, which it was.\nSo now you’re staring at your fantasy roster and realizing: You have a first-round pick who you don’t feel safe starting. He might not be C.J. Anderson bad, but it’s not good.\nThere is speculation Lacy hasn’t completely recovered from his earlier ankle injury, but you would think if it were a big enough problem to stunt Lacy’s production and workload to the degree Sunday’s game would suggest (four carries for three yards), then why wouldn’t the Packers just sit him down and let him heal?\nThere are other reasons for worry. Lacy’s weight could be, um, weighing him down — he is listed at 234 pounds, but does not look lean by any stretch. His yards per carry is down significantly from last season — to 3.9 from 4.6. His touchdown frequency has dipped remarkably — he scored once every 25.3 touches over his first two seasons, but has just one TD in 76 touches this year.\nIf you have him, well, you’re stuck. You’re not going to find good trade value right now. If you are in need, however, it is a good time to buy low. Lacy normally turns it on in the second half of the season — 16 of his 24 total TDs his first two seasons have come in the final eight games.\nAs the weather cools, the Packers will lean more on the running game. If the ankle is a problem, by then maybe it’s not. If Lacy isn’t in game shape now, by then maybe he will be. There is reason to believe when the Packers do start to lean later, they will lean Lacy’s direction, even if they didn’t this week.\n  Filed under eddie lacy ,  fantasy football ,  green bay packers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:44:57.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
