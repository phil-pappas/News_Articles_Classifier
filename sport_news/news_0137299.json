That was good enough for Fallon and he immediately set out to master all the intricate details of the new offense he would be running.\n“I knew we would be throwing the ball 20, 30 times a game,” Fallon said with a smile. “Coach came in, taught us the offense and we were able to do well in some of the 7-on-7 tournaments.”\nJudging by the early results, Fallon is clearly proving to be a good student. He has completed 41-of-76 passes for 805 yards and 10 touchdowns as Milton is off to its best start in years at 3-0. In last Friday’s signature 28-7 win over Walpole, Fallon threw for 241 yards and two touchdowns, while adding a 23-yard TD run.\n“There’s been a buzz around town since coach Dembowski took over. We’re not one of those schools that gets a lot of football attention,” Fallon said. “Walpole is a traditional powerhouse team, but we had a great scheme and it was a great team win for us.”\nFallon’s abilities haven’t come as a total surprise to Dembowski. He knew well before accepting the coaching position in April that Milton had some building blocks that he could develop.\n“When I first started investigating the job, people were telling me that Milton had a good quarterback coming back,” Dembowski said. “I started looking at the Hudl films and I could see he had ability. He’s a smart kid who picked it up quickly.\n“He might have the strongest arm of any kid I’ve had since Kyle Beatrice, they’re in the same talent level. He also runs a lot like Chris Cameron, his running game is really developing. In the last game he ran for 50 something yards.\n“His game is improving every single week.”\nNot a comforting thought for the Wildcats’ future opponents.\nDo you have a similar story in your community?
