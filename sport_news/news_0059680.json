He was relaxed and was literally pinching himself to face the reality of becoming GM now. \n\nThe last 24 hours changed a lot for him. Dhopade took a whopping 336 games to add just 11 Elo points after the third GM norm he achieved in Chennai in January 2013. He went on to add two more GM norms but failed to catch the magic figure of 2500 till Friday. \n\nBy becoming the first GM from Vidarbha, he presented himself a pleasant birthday gift. He turned 25 on October 5. \n\nAlthough, he started playing chess quite late at the age of 12, he picked up the nuances of the game rapidly. He was always ready for learning new things and worked hard to realize his goals. \n\nTaking some time after the penultimate round in Pune, Dhopade spoke exclusively to TOI \n\nHere are the excerpts... \n\nQ: After becoming GM, do you think pressure is off now and you can play freely now? \n\nA: Yes, I think the pressure is off now! I have been playing quite solidly in every game till now. But now as I have completed my title I can bring some changes to my game. \n\nQ: What is your next target? \n\nA: My next target is to cross 2600 Elo rating. I should make my form count now. Churning out good results in Fide-rating tournaments will be the key now. \n\nQ: Do you think your best is yet to come? Do you think you have the potential to become one of the best chess players of India? \n\nA: Yes, I think I can still achieve a lot more. My best has not come yet. I am still improving and I feel I can be one of the top players of India if I maintain good form. \n\nQ: Which aspects of the game you think are needed to work on so that you achieve more glory in future? \n\nA: Mainly I need to work on my openings. Till now I have been playing a limited set of opening systems, focusing more on middle-game and end-game, which makes it easier for my opponent to prepare against me. So I think I need to broaden my opening repertoire. \n\nQ: Who is your favourite chess player? Which non-chess player you admire the most? \n\nA: My favourite chess player is the ex-world champion Anatoly Karpov of Russia. I learnt a lot from his games since childhood. I developed my game on his style. I am big fan Karpov. I admire Abhinav Bindra and Yuvraj Singh a lot. \n\nQ: Besides playing chess which sports you follow the most? \n\nA: In general I like all the sports. But particularly I follow cricket and tennis. I like watching live matches on TV whenever I get time. It relaxes me a great deal. \n\nQ: How do you like to spend your free time? \n\nA: When I have free time, I love to read books, especially spiritual books and listen to Bollywood songs. Reading spiritual books has helped me a lot in concentrating better during my matches. I always have the books with me.
