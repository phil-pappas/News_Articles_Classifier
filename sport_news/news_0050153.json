The next game is the next challenge. \n\"When you're playing a game every couple of days, you can't fill your head with all the fantastic praise and headlines. Furthermore, my goals are always the goals of my team. \n\"I'm 27 years old and am trying, if this is the peak, to ensure that it lasts as long as possible. Moreover, winning trophies is part of being at the top of the game.\" \nBayern are already eight points clear as they attempt to win their fourth Bundesliga title in a row, but Lewandowski refused to discount their rivals. \nHe added: \"Have you ever seen a footballer, who after eight matchdays, breaks out in celebration and goes partying? \n\"We might have an advantage at the moment, but I don't believe teams like Borussia Dortmund, Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen don't stand a chance. The Bundesliga remains a challenge for us.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:07:15.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
