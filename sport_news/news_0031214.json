What really beefs up his adrenaline, he said, is spending an entire day at a town festival, provoking one bull after another to charge him, or if that fails, charging directly at the bull.\nENLARGE Isaac Álvarez and bull “In the small towns,” Mr. Boix said, “you have hours with the animals.”\nEvery year across Spain, bull-obsessed adrenaline addicts seek their fix by traveling from town to town to participate in local iterations of Pamplona. They’re a haphazard group, so it is hard to hit the bull’s-eye on their numbers—at least several hundred, according to fans and some of the men themselves.\nThe Mediterranean coastal region of Valencia, Mr. Boix’s home turf, holds around 7,000 festivals each year that feature bulls and cows with horns, mainly in the summer and autumn.\n“Where there’s a bull, there’s a fiesta,” said Francisco Miró Simó, 62, president of the club that organizes a festival in nearby Alquerías de Santa Bárbara. “If there are no bulls, only a quarter of the people would show up” at festivals, he said.\n“We are always with bulls,” Mr. Boix said of his fellow itinerants. They are often called recortadores , those who intercept the bull’s path, quickly sidestep its charging horns, then use their bodies like a bullfighter’s cape to steer the animal around. They are also called corredores , or runners, when sprinting alongside the animals.\n“They see risk as a kind of entertainment,” said José Ramón Caballero de la Calle, a veterinary professor at Spain’s University of Castilla-La Mancha who treats festival bulls.\nSpain’s bull festivals have gained more than the usual attention this year. A record 13 people have been killed, according to Spanish media, prompting criticism even from traditional bullfight aficionados who say only professionals, trained and supported by experts, are fit to confront a dangerous bull. Amateurs, they say, are better off in the stands.\nAt Spanish Festivals, Daredevils Dodge Bulls Smaller events offer more time with bulls, fans say. fullscreen Isaac Álvarez jumps over a bull in Castellón city, in Spain's Valencia region, in 2010. The particularly daring move for a recortador is known as a salto del angel, or swan dive. The 28-year-old reckons he will visit around 70 bull festivals in 2015 to perform swan dives, knee swerves and to run around arenas provoking bulls to charge at him. Town officials sometimes pay Mr. Álvarez and other recortadores for their stunts to ensure maximum thrills. Published Credit: Isaac Álvarez Isaac Alvarez … A bull peers through protective bars at thrill-seekers who have scurried for safety from the charging beast at an annual bull fiesta in Alcalá de Chivert, Spain. The bull’s horns have been slathered with a combustible material and set aflame by members of local clubs that stage the traditional spectacle. The animal then thunders around a makeshift arena, running at daredevils who place themselves in its path. Jeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal … A bull, known in Spanish as a manso, meaning tame, emerges to corral a more ferocious bull back into the holding pen. The fiercer bull has been thundering around a makeshift arena during a festival in Alcalá de Chivert, Spain, charging at daredevils who try to provoke it. Once the tame bull emerges into the makeshift arena, the fiercer bull typically follows the manso’s lead and trots behind it back into the pen. Jeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal … Once the bulls are back in their pens, Saul Boix, in the yellow T-shirt, and other recortadores give the kids in Alcalá de Chivert, Spain, a taste of what it’s like to have a bull charging at you—without the risk, but with squeals of laughter. Jeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal … View from the bell tower in Alcalá de Chivert, in Spain’s Mediterranean coastal region of Valencia. The region holds more than 7,000 bull-oriented festivals each year, mainly in the summer and autumn. Jeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal … A man looks at a bull named Avión waiting in its pen in Alquerías de Santa Bárbara, Spain. Daredevils looped a 164-foot-long rope around the bull’s horns and ran it up and down main street for about an hour, charging and baiting the animal along the way. The traditional festival, held in the town since 1895, is known as toro en cuerda , or bull on a rope. Jeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal … A bull named Cacereño gazes from its pen as it waits for thrill-seekers to loop a 164-foot-long rope around its horns and trot it up and down main street in Alquerías de Santa Bárbara, Spain. The tradition known as “bull on a rope” is a venue for recortadores and corredores to showcase their gumption. Jeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal … Cacereño the bull barrels past bystanders slipping behind protective metal barriers at an annual bull festival in Alquerías de Santa Bárbara, Spain. Some locals outfit their own driveways with the metal barriers, so friends and family can lounge around drinking and eating, and sneak a peak in safety as the animal charges past. Jeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal …\nAvión the bull takes a break from being run up and down main street in Alquerías de Santa Bárbara, Spain. Hundreds of people gather each year in the small town to run alongside the bull or watch it at a safer distance. “Where there’s a bull, there’s a fiesta,” says Francisco Miró Simó, 62, president of the club that organizes the festival.\nJeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal … Pablo Roig Villalba holds a tracking device that he attaches to the bull’s rope during the Alquerías de Santa Bárbara festival. The apparatus is a precaution after a bull bolted from its pen three years ago and kept running, as the men guiding the animal lost their grasp on the rope. The bull was located hours later in a grove of orange and lemon trees. The tracker is typically used for pigeons. ‘It’s better than nothing!’ the 35-year-old says. Jeannette Neumann/The Wall Street Journal … of SHOW CAPTION HIDE CAPTION fullscreen Festival organizers and local officials who sponsor the events say they have safety measures in place, such as an ambulance and medical staff on hand and regulations on barrier size so that people can slip through, but bulls can’t.\nAs in past years, the casualties were mostly risk-taking bystanders who slip out from behind protective barriers rather than more-experienced recortadores, according to Spanish journalists and festival organizers.\nMost bystanders are content to watch from behind the barriers. “The crowd appreciates it more if the recortador places himself in dangerous situations,” Mr. Caballero de la Calle said.\nMr. Boix estimated he will have traveled to 100 Spanish festivals this year to egg on bulls on streets and in makeshift arenas. At times, he and others dodge bulls whose horns have been slathered with a combustible material and set aflame by members of local clubs that stage the traditional spectacle.\nTown officials sometimes pay Mr. Boix and others for their stunts to ensure maximum thrills.\nTheir antics are dangerous, but so is life, said Juan Moreno, 73, a retired forest ranger, as he watched Mr. Boix run toward a 775-pound bull pounding down the street. “Getting in a car and going out on the road is also dangerous.”\nMr. Boix, keeping himself an arm’s length away and using his body like a target, shepherded the bull around the intersection. The crowd applauded.\n“I’m not fearful,” he said as he prepared to step into the path of the next bull. “Respectful, always. You shouldn’t underestimate an animal. It can kill you.”\nUnlike at bullfights in traditional arenas, where bulls nearly always die, bulls in Valencia’s festivals typically don’t, local officials say. Still, that’s no consolation if they survive to be tortured repeatedly in the name of tradition, animal-rights activists say.\nMr. Boix and his band of brothers say that’s bull; no one loves the animals more than they do.\nBrowse Recent A-heds ENLARGE No, Really, You Won a Nobel Prize Did Cronkite’s Gift Really Come From Hitler’s Urinal? In This Texas Town, Chickens Ruffle Feathers The first time he laid his eyes on the beasts he was 6 years old in Alcalá de Chivert, his hometown. “The bulls, to me, seemed very fierce, very strong, and the people who put themselves in front of them, I remember admiring them,” he said. Ten years later, he ran alongside his first bull, joining a centuries-old Spanish practice that brought ranch animals from countryside to town.\nTo excel, a recortador must probe the psychology of beast and man, said Isaac Álvarez, who reckons he will take part in around 70 festivals this year.\n“A big mistake is overconfidence. You have to be cautious,” said Mr. Álvarez, 28, known for a move called the knee swerve. As a bull barrels into an arena, the recortador stays on his knees, swaying his torso to dodge the animal as hundreds of spectators watch.\n“When you’re in the plaza, alone with the bull, hotheaded, sometimes you go overboard,” he said. “And later you realize, ‘That was a crazy thing to do.’ ”\nMr. Álvarez said he was repeatedly rammed in the stomach by a bull during a 2010 festival. He spent a week in intensive care and three weeks bedridden at home. “At the hospital, I did think about quitting,” he said. “But then when I left the hospital, I said, ‘It can’t be.’ It’s almost as if you need it. It’s a bit incomprehensible.”\nA tradition known as “bull on a rope” offers another venue for recortadores to showcase their gumption.\nIn Alquerías de Santa Bárbara, Pablo Roig Villalba and his buddies looped a 165-foot-long rope around a bull’s horns and ran the animal up and down main street for about an hour, charging the bull along the way. Mr. Roig Villalba, 35, said he goes to about a dozen bull celebrations a year.\nRope or no rope, bulls can get away. Three years ago, a bull bolted from its pen and kept running, as the men guiding it lost their grasp on the rope. The animal was located hours later in a grove of orange and lemon trees.\nSince then, locals attach to the bull’s rope a 2-inch-long tracking device typically used for pigeons.\nWrite to Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ539_BULL_6_P_20151006174546.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AE938_AhedIn_G_20150624162255.gif", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ539_BULL_6_M_20151006174546.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ545_BULL_1_H_20151006174607.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ538_BULL_5_M_20151006174548.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ541_BULL_3_M_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ540_BULL_2_M_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ546_BULL_7_M_20151006174617.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ539_BULL_6_H_20151006174546.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ545_BULL_1_M_20151006174607.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ538_BULL_5_H_20151006174548.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ537_BULL_4_P_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ541_BULL_3_P_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ540_BULL_2_H_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ543_BULL_8_P_20151006174607.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ540_BULL_2_P_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ544_BULL_9_H_20151006174606.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ543_BULL_8_H_20151006174607.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ543_BULL_8_M_20151006174607.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ538_BULL_5_P_20151006174548.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ544_BULL_9_M_20151006174606.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ546_BULL_7_H_20151006174617.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ545_BULL_1_P_20151006174607.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GT941_Bill_F_G_20151008153534.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ546_BULL_7_P_20151006174617.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ552_BULL_0_P_20151006180709.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ537_BULL_4_M_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ544_BULL_9_P_20151006174606.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ537_BULL_4_H_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ541_BULL_3_H_20151006174547.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ552_BULL_0_M_20151006180709.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:56:39.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
