It was the go-ahead score in a game the Vikings won 28-19 at Ford Field.\n“All I had to do was lay it out there and he went and made the play,” quarterback Teddy Bridgewater said.\nAsked after the victory where the football was, Diggs said he had no idea.\n“Funny story. I lost it. [Just kidding],” Diggs said. “I didn’t keep it. But hopefully there’s more to come.”\nConsidering how well Diggs has played in his first three NFL games, that seems like a pretty safe bet.\nThe fifth-round draft pick out of Maryland led the Vikings with six catches for 108 receiving yards Sunday. It was his second consecutive game in triple digits.\nDiggs, who got the start over a healthy Charles Johnson , now has 19 catches for 324 yards in his first three NFL games.\n“I wouldn’t say it’s coming easy,” Diggs said. “I just try to go out there and do what I can for my guys, have a good time, have fun and play at a high level.”\nGetting his kicks\nBlair Walsh made all five of his field-goal attempts, including two from beyond 50 yards as the Vikings began their comeback in the second quarter.\n“It was big,” coach Mike Zimmer said. “We missed three kicks here last year.”\nAfter a shaky preseason, Walsh has made 14 of his 16 field-goal tries this season.\n“I’m just trying to make kicks,” said Walsh, who did miss a 33-yard extra point, his second PAT miss of the season. “All I’ve been thinking about the past two weeks is moving on and making kicks.”\nRed-zone trouble\nThere was a reason why Walsh was so busy Sunday. The Vikings scored only one touchdown on their four red-zone trips. On two of those drives, they had the ball inside the Lions 5-yard line only to settle for a field goal.\n“We tried a couple of runs in there and they were really blitzing everybody off of the edge,” Zimmer said. “Then we missed the throw to [ Mike ] Wallace in the corner of the end zone [in the third quarter]. … We’ll look at it and keep working.”\nEntering the game, the Vikings had scored touchdowns on only seven of their 15 red-zone trips and ranked 24th in the NFL in red-zone touchdown percentage.\nTaking precautions\nWide receiver Jarius Wright is going through the NFL’s concussion protocol after getting knocked out of the game late in the third quarter.\nWright hit his head on the turf after dropping a pass from Bridgewater in Lions territory. When he got to his feet, he was wobbly and had to be helped off the field. He did not return.\nAdam Thielen replaced Wright as the slot receiver and three plays later set up a 22-yard field goal early with a 30-yard catch and run.\nSafety first\nWith the Vikings backed up near their end zone after a late goal-line stand, Zimmer instructed punter Jeff Locke to take a safety instead of trying to attempt a punt from deep in the end zone. The two-point safety made the score 28-19.\n“I was trying to take a little time off the clock, give us a little more breathing room,” Zimmer said. “They still have to score nine points, so I wasn’t worried about it.”\nAfter the ensuing free kick, the Vikings forced a turnover on downs to seal the victory.\nRemembering Flip\nZimmer began his postgame news conference by offering his condolences to the family of Flip Saunders , the Timberwolves coach and executive who lost his battle with Hodgkin’s lymphoma on Sunday.\n“I was fortunate enough to get a chance to meet him,” Zimmer said. “He came down to training camp and he’s a really, really good man, so I hope his family is doing OK. It’s a really tough day in the Twin Cities with losing a guy like that.”\nInactives\nQuarterback Taylor Heinicke , cornerback Jabari Price , defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd , offensive linemen Nick Easton and Jeremiah Sirles , tight end Chase Ford and defensive end Justin Trattou were inactive for the Vikings. Floyd, who is dealing with an ankle/knee injury, was ruled out on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:48:19.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
