But this is the type of game that a player can build his reputation. I'm pulling for him to play against the Patriots for purely selfish reasons.\nI want to see Sean Lee matched up against New England's all-world tight end Rob Gronkowski.\nTom Brady will throw to Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola when he wants to complete passes. But when he wants to make plays, he looks for Gronkowski. At 6-6, 265 pounds, he's a wide receiver in a tight end's body. He set NFL season records for tight ends for yardage (1,327) and touchdowns (17) in 2011. Gronkowski has gone to three Pro Bowls in his first five seasons and, like Lee, injuries have kept him from Hawaii in other seasons.\nGronkowski caught five passes for 94 yards and three touchdowns in this season's opener against Pittsburgh, then caught seven passes for 113 yards and a touchdown in the second week against Buffalo and four passes for 101 yards in the third week against Jacksonville. With the unbeaten Patriots coming off a bye, Gronkowski has had a week to rest up now for the Cowboys.\nGronkowski is averaging 19.3 yards per catch. That's almost seven more yards per catch than Julio Jones and five more than Antonio Brown. He's a matchup nightmare for defenses. The Patriots like to flank him, and when they do, he proves too big for cornerbacks and safeties and too fast for linebackers.\nThe ideal defender for Gronkowski is someone with the size of a linebacker, the speed of a safety and the hands of a cornerback. Someone like Lee. He's the best playmaker on the Dallas defense and also the best coverage linebacker. He has the chance to run with Gronkowski and, at 6-2, 238 pounds, a chance to be physical with him as well.\nLee intercepted four passes in 2011 to lead the Cowboys and broke up eight others. He again led the team with four interceptions in 2013 even though he missed the final three games of the season with a neck injury. Lee also has an interception this September, picking off Sam Bradford in coverage of tight end Zach Ertz in a victory at Philadelphia.\nLee gives the Cowboys their best chance of survival in a game of pitch-and-catch between Brady and Gronkowski. If he plays, that is. It goes without saying the Cowboys will need him against Gronkowski.\nHow special is Gronk? Jason Witten is a 10-time Pro Bowl tight end for the Cowboys closing in on 1,000 career catches. He has 19 100-yard games in his 13-year career. Gronkowski has had 17 100-yard games in his six seasons. He had a six catch, 160-yard, two-touchdown game against Washington in 2011 and a nine-catch, 149-yard, three-TD game versus Chicago in 2014. He's scored touchdowns of 52 and 50 yards in his career.\nIf you can't cover Gronkowski, you're not going to beat the Patriots.\nThe Cowboys need Lee on the field to have that chance.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges.\nTwitter: @RickGosselinDMN\nMore Cowboys coverage\nThe Latest Moore: Suspension over, Greg Hardy meets the media;
