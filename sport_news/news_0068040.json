Alabama is a championship football program led by a championship coach. \nThat's just as true today as it was in 2008 and 2012. \nAlabama 38, Georgia 10 is proof. So is that foolish false bravado displayed before the game on the field, as the Georgia players went looking for trouble, and on the scoreboard, in that cute hype video with the tagline, \"We Grow Champions Here.\" \nReally? Since when? Not since 2005, if you mean SEC champions. Not since 1980, if you're talking about national champions. \nSEC East championships are nice. Maybe Missouri will let Georgia win one of those again someday. Maybe it'll be this year if Jim McElwain and the Florida Gators don't get in the way. \nIn any case, good luck to the Bulldogs the rest of the way, and if all else fails, come November, you may still have Auburn to kick around. \nThat's my take.
