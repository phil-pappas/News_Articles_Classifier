With three gold, ten silver and nine bronze medals, Oman climbed to third place in the standings. \nAiman al Kulaibi missed a medal as he finished fourth in the 200m backstroke and Nidhal al Harassi came sixth in the 100m butterfly event. \nMeanwhile, the national handball team lost its first match in the tournament, going down to Bahrain 28-29 in a thriller.
