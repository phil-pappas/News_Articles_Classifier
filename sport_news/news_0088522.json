The league moved the championship tournament from the spring to the fall during the 2015 season, meaning that the Warriors won \"last year's\" title this past spring and then last weekend, captured their second 2015 title of the season. \n\"It was crazy, we got sweatshirts last year that said 2015 champions, and now it was the same exact t-shirts with 2015 champions,\" said co-captain Sam Gervais. \"We all joked that maybe they just made copies of the shirt? \n\"Fall is our main season. We play better in the fall coming off of summer and it was hard last year having the NE-10 tournament in the spring because we had such a bad winter, it was hard to practice. Before the NE-10 tournament last year we were coming off of only being indoors. In the fall everyone is more comfortable and everyone has been practicing all summer at their home courses. I think it works better in the fall. But we all did really well.\" \nAlessandra Ricigliano was the top finisher in the tournament, winning the league's individual crown while freshman Krystal Knight finished second overall. \nGervais and co-captain Jaclyn Drew were leading a team that was without its founding members for the first time this season. A class led by Ali Reed graduated n the spring, and were the three founding members of the golf team. \nThe focus early on was making sure the team-first approach was present. \n\"Our seniors brought the team together last year,\" Gervais said. \"They were so good to me when I came in. We wanted to really follow that. Its hard with golf, individually, if you have a tough day to come back and not talk to everyone. We try to do fun things with them, you want to make it so that you're around friends. Everyone seems to perform well because of that. It's really a positive and encouraging group.\" \nThere's a lot of time on the road to hone that team building as well. \nAfter a tournament in New Hampshire to start the season, the Warriors spent weekends in Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and Ohio. \nReed's class might no longer be on the roster, but their fingerprints are all over the program, Gervais said. \n\"Ali really helped me the most when I first came here,\" she said. \"They started the team so it's hard to see them leave. They were a great influence and we wanted to pick up where she left off. If I didn't have the golf team I don't think I would have had the same experience at Merrimack, honestly.\" \nThe Warriors will now take a few months off before hitting the range in preparation for the spring season. Last winter was hectic for the Warriors, limiting them to simulator work at a facility in Middleton for most of the winter. \nOnce the weather warms, they'll be back on the links at North Andover Country Club and Indian Ridge prepping for tournaments that, as you can tell, typically takes them outside of the New England region. \n\"It's a lot of 4 a.m. bus rides to Logan,\" Gervais said. \"Some of those are interesting. But we fly together, play together, and really that helps in connecting us all. I wasn't sure how this season would go without the seniors, but it went great.\" \nThere's a blend of different personalities on the roster and an influx of freshman players, particularly Knight, that have contributed immediately on the scorecards. \n\"Krystal has been a great motivator,\" Gervais said. \"She's focused but also a lot of fun. She fits right in. \n\"We all came together really nice and I think we worked really well together. There are different personalities and our coach is great. It really makes it fun. A lot of the travel brings us closer. It's not about who shoots better, it's a team thing. How do we do as a team? That's how we go about it and that's why I think we have so much success.\" \nWith your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:46:46.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
