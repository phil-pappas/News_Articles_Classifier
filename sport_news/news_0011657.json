But it also may never have been tougher than this year. No. 5-ranked Dakota (7-2) opens against defending state champion and No. 10-ranked Forreston (7-2). If the Indians win, they’ll then likely meet No. 2 Toulon Stark County, a team that has reached the semifinals twice in the last four years, including one year in 2A. Likely awaiting in the third and fourth rounds would be undefeated No. 4 Polo and No. 1 Lena-Winslow. “It’s a tough draw, but we can’t look ahead,” Dakota coach Rick Schmitz said. “It’s the playoffs. Let’s go. “Sometimes if you want to get somewhere, you have to go through the toughest.” The northern half of the 1A draw not only includes four of the five top teams in the state, it also includes Three Rivers Rock division champ Orion (8-1), which was No. 6 in the last 2A poll. The Three Rivers is the only conference that has been even close to as successful in small-school football as the NUIC, which won both the 1A and 2A titles last year. Orion would play Le-Win in the second round. Orion has made the playoffs 11 times in the last 14 years, always in 2A or 3A before, and has reached the second round in 2A in three of the last four years. Le-Win coach Ric Arand doesn’t think it’s an unfair draw, though. His Panthers have met Orion in the playoffs twice before, losing both times, but both were close games when Le-Win was a 5-4 team vs. a 9-0 Orion team. “We always felt we gave those two games away,” Arand said. “It’s going to be an awfully tough path to state,” Arand said, “but I think it’s split pretty equally. We can’t complain about the draw and the opportunity to play somebody we haven’t played before.” First-round 1A matchups involving NUIC teams are: Elgin Westminster Christian (6-3) at Polo, Warren Co-op (6-3) at Chicago Hope Academy (8-1), Stockton (7-2) at Galena (7-2) and Princeville (5-4) at Le-Win. “The north is loaded,” Forreston coach Denny Diduch said. “Whoever comes out of the north is going to earn it. We did it to ourselves. We beat Galena and Galena beat Dakota. When you go round and round like that, you are going to wind up in the middle.” That tough road will lead to a lot of NUIC rematches. “It’s going to be a tough journey when you meet up again,” Galena coach Ed Freed said. “That’s also what makes it fun and exciting. You’ve got to be at your best at the most important time in the season.” Page 2 of 2 - Aquin (5-4) just missed the playoffs. The Bulldogs ranked second-highest on the list of 5-4 teams in 1A that didn't get in. If their nine opponents had won one more game on the season, the Bulldogs would have made it. In Class 2A, West Carroll (5-4) is a No. 16 seed at No. 1 Downs Tri-Valley (9-0).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:15:36.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
