In just five games it feels as if Cowboys fans have experienced all kinds of emotions with two division wins and three straight losses without its two star players.\nWith Romo and Bryant out, other players have had to step up. Naturally, some have done better than others.\nBelow are 10 units or players that have been focal points of the Cowboys' season so far. Under each description, there are polls to vote in to grade their performance so far.\n1). The offensive line After an offseason of hype around how good the Cowboys' offensive line was going to be, fans might have been hit with a let down through five games. Special contributor Bob Sturm and insider David Moore have both touched on why they think the unit has struggled at times this year.\nSure, not having Tony Romo or DeMarco Murray might be contributing to the unit's production this year, but the line is made up of all of the same players from a year ago, plus rookie La'el Collins, who many pegged as a first-round talent.\nWhat grade should the Cowboys' offensive line receive?\n2. Brandon Weeden Weeden was given the keys to a 2-0 Cowboys team and subsequently handed them off to Matt Cassel after going 0-3 as the replacement starter. And he's \"pissed\" about that .\nThe unluckiest quarterback alive played decently enough to keep the Cowboys in a couple games and then got blown out by the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.\nSo much was made about the dink-and-dunk play calling from head coach Jason Garrett, but Bob Sturm said that Weeden was the reason that the offense was limited .\nWhat grade should Brandon Weeden receive?\n3. Jason Witten Texas Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre got some deserved high praise for playing injured for the second half of the lengthy baseball season and in the playoffs. Not much is different about Witten.\nAll he's done is play through a sprained knee and two sprained ankles . That kind of toughness drew praise from Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski .\nWhat grade should Jason Witten receive?\n4. Sean Lee Doesn't it feel good to have Robot Sean Lee back?\nThe linebacker leads the Cowboys with 41 total tackles despite missing time from a cut lip that needed stitches and a concussion against the New Orleans Saints. Once again, health remains a huge factor for Lee.\nHowever, as David Moore points out here , Sean Lee is a linebacking genius.\nWhat grade should Sean Lee receive?\n5. Lucky Whitehead Coming into this season, Whitehead was pegged as a special teams savior that could replace the production that Dwayne Harris left when he signed with the New York Giants. He's since been replaced by Cole Beasley on punt returns.\nWhitehead has one kickoff return for 21 yards and one kickoff return for negative two yards. As a receiver, he has one catch for negative three yards.\nWhat grade should Lucky Whitehead receive?\n6. Greg Hardy Not a bad season debut, eh? The one on the field wasn't too shabby. Off the field....there's more to be desired. Especially given all of the backlash from his \"guns blazing\" and talk about Tom Brady's wife.\nHardy was called a \"garbage human\" being by Fox Sports 1's Katie Nolan and CBS Sports' Jim Nantz also criticized the defensive end . And then there was that rap music video that didn't help his case.\nAs Kevin Sherrington writes, has Hardy learned his lesson ?\nWhat grade should Greg Hardy receive?\n7. Joseph Randle Replacing DeMarco Murray is no easy task, and the Cowboys' front office wasn't sure if Randle could do it alone so they went and assembled a running back committee. Randle splits time with Darren McFadden, Lance Dunbar (who is out for the year) and Christine Michael.\nFans have seen some flashes of hope (think in the Atlanta game where he dominated the first half on the ground) and signs of concern ( that touchdown dive against the Saints ).\nHis best statistical game has come against the Falcons where he rushed for 87 yards and three touchdowns, but he wasn't much of a factor in the second half.\nWhat grade should Joseph Randle receive?\n8. Darren McFadden Randle's counterpart, McFadden, has stayed relatively healthy, which was a concern when the Cowboys went out and got him to be part of the committee. He hasn't cracked 35 rushing yards in the five games this season (albeit he's only averaged 7.4 carries per game), but he has factored nicely into the passing game catching 12 passes for 102 yards.\nWhat grade should Darren McFadden receive?\n9. Defensive backs Before Hardy showed up to bolster the pass rush, the secondary had to go up against high-powered offenses that featured players like Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, Drew Brees and Odell Beckham Jr without its top cornerback in Orlando Scandrick.\nBarry Church leads the unit in total tackles with 37, but missed a key tackle in the team's overtime loss to the Saints. Brandon Carr, Morris Claiborne, J.J. Wilcox and rookie Byron Jones have all accumulated at least 14 tackles and one pass deflection. Wilcox is the lone member with an interception.\nWhat grade should the defensive backs receive?\n10. Wide receivers When Dez Bryant went down with an injury, the team's best receiver might have been Lance Dunbar, who also got injured. That left Terrance Williams, Cole Beasley and Brice Butler to pick up the slack.\nButler's success was short lived. After the Cowboys gave up a fifth-round pick to get him , he caught a 67-yard pass against the Saints before injuring his hamstring on that very play .\nWilliams was a no show against the Falcons where he dropped a pass on fourth down to end the game. He then lashed out at fans on Twitter after the drop .\nWhat grade should the wide receivers receive?\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nMoore: Five significant issues Cowboys need to focus on during bye week, including team's identity\nGosselin: What to expect from Randy Gregory if he returns after Cowboys bye week\nMoore: What to make of Brandon Weeden's play, how Cowboys QB handles adversity\nReplacing Romo, Dez and DeMarco Murray: Vote and grade these 10 Dallas Cowboys players, units\nHow 10 of the newest Cowboys are faring so far this season\nJon Machota answers Cowboys questions at 11 a.m. Oct. 23; ask your questions now\nGeorge: 'Rabid dog' Dez Bryant, 'hard-headed' Joseph Randle among 5 former Oklahoma State standouts now starring for Dallas Cowboys\nMachota: Why the Cowboys will repeat as NFC East champions\nSturm: Scott Linehan's logic is making it easier to defend Cowboys\nMoore: Can Greg Hardy's season be as good as his first game?\nGosselin: Why the Cowboys miss Bill Callahan this season\nCowlishaw: Why Cowboys' backup QB battle isn't something to get too caught up in\nMachota: Risky to rush Dez Bryant back; which Cowboys RB best compares to DeMarco Murray?\nBob Sturm: Brandon Weeden limited the Cowboys offense, the offense didn't limit Weeden\nLatest news, photos Top 15 fan photos from the Cowboys' first five games, including the Pope, an octo-bong, Left Shark and more\nTop 15 photos from the Cowboys' first five games; Terrance Williams levitates, Erin Andrews can't even\nCowboys WR Dez Bryant returns to alma mater Friday for Lufkin's homecoming\nJerry Jones: Cowboys QB Matt Cassel will take more chances, and that could lead to more turnovers\nJerry Jones: Yes, we miss Bill Callahan, but I'm not disappointed in Joseph Randle or our running game\nGreg Hardy: Should you root for him?
