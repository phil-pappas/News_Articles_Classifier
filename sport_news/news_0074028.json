(Liz Martin/The Gazette) Most Popular October 2, 2015 | 11:07 pm \nCEDAR RAPIDS — Sometimes the better team does not win. \nJefferson lost the football four times, its starting quarterback in the third quarter and an overtime contest to No. 9 Cedar Falls, 34-31, Friday night at Kingston Stadium. \nJefferson (3-3, 1-1 in Class 4A District 6) rolled up 432 yards of total offense. The J-Hawks rushed for 344 yards. \n“We felt coming in we were the better team,” said Jefferson Coach Brian Webb, a Cedar Falls grad. “But you can’t have four turnovers and beat a team like Cedar Falls. They make you pay for your mistakes.” \nCedar Falls (5-1, 2-0) erased a 21-14 deficit by scoring 14 points in the fourth quarter. The final touchdown was a 1-yard sneak by quarterback Taylen Alexander and it came with 2:02 to play. Jefferson’s defense allowed Alexander to score. \n“We needed time on the clock and it worked out,” Webb said. \nJunior backup quarterback Dylan Hart drove the J-Hawks 83 yards, connecting on 5 of 6 passes, the last a fourth down scoring pass to senior wide receiver Jalyn Stafford with 9 seconds left in regulation. \nHart took over when senior Jared Eivins reinjured a shoulder running the ball in the third quarter. Eivins rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown before he was injured. \nHart scored one touchdown and finished 8 of 9 passing for 68 yards. \n“The team said it’s your time, let’s go,” Hart said. \nJefferson took a 31-28 lead in overtime on Zebediah Render’s 29-yard field goal. \nCedar Falls tailback Hayden Clausen won the game with a 5-yard touchdown run on the Tigers’ possession. Clausen had 94 yards rushing and two TDs. \n“We found a way to come back and win,” said Alexander, who finished 11 of 18 passing for 177 yards. \nJefferson’s Tavian Rashed led all rushers with 99 yards. Manny Oluntunde had 84 on just five carries.
