You just have to go out there, overcome and adapt every week.” \nAs far as morale goes, Gomez says his team has responded well with the understanding that a district title is not out of the question, but the road there begins with the Falcons. \n“It’s just something that’s in their heart. The bottom line is that they came in Monday ready to work,” Gomez said. “I told them after the game that we won’t be undefeated district champions, but we still have an opportunity. The only opportunity is to get after Los Fresnos in a 48-minute game. \n“We understand that in this district it’s like district championship every week, but we’ve geared up for this since the offseason. We’re going to fight to the end.” \nFor more on this story, visit RGVSports.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:34:51.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
