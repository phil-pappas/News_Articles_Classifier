(Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports) \nPITTSBURGH -- Jake Arrieta’s family was strolling around downtown Pittsburgh late Wednesday morning, enjoying the beautiful day, when they spotted Chicago Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio. \nCooper Arrieta, their 3-year-old son, ran toward Bosio, leaped into his arms, and hugged him. \n“Where’s your dad?’’ Bosio said. \n“Oh, he’s back at the hotel,’’ Cooper said. “He’s mad today. He’s very mad.’’ \nBosio: “That’s a good thing, right?’’ \nCooper: “Yes, very good.’’ \nArrieta, showing just how good he is when angry, led the Cubs to their first postseason victory in 12 years, knocking out the Pittsburgh Pirates, 4-0, in the National League wild-card game at PNC Park. \nThe only time the Pirates even came close to knocking Arrieta out of the game was in the seventh inning when Pirates reliever Tony Watson drilled Arrieta. Arrieta, who had hit two batters earlier in the game, was incensed. He took a few steps, screamed at Watson, and both benches then poured out onto the field, with a lot of pushing and yelling going on, but no punches. \nWell, unless you count the punches Pirates first baseman Sean Rodriguez threw at the water cooler in the Pirates dugout, after being ejected for being an antagonist in the scrum. Sean Rodriguez heard this water cooler was talking trash \nAh, nothing like getting a preliminary round in before the main event, with the Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals renewing their bitter 112-year rivalry Friday in the best-of-five NL Division Series. \nThtese two franchises have played 2,224 games against one another - with the Cubs leading 1,127 to 1,097 - but never have they played against one another in a postseason game. \n“There’s no pressure on us,’’ Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said, smiling. “We’re very confident and very loose. We’re just going to have fun.’’ \nCertainly, Arrieta and the Cubs had a blast Wednesday night at the Pirates’ expense. \nIt was cruel bad enough that the Pirates’ season ended at the same juncture a year ago, facing San Francisco Giants ace Madison Bumgarner. \nThis was even worse. \nArrieta, the hottest pitchers on Planet Earth these days, continued his ungodly performance in the second half by pitching nine shutout innings. \nCubs rookie right fielder Kyle Schwarber spotted Arrieta a 3-0 lead by the third inning, with a run-scoring single in the first, and a towering two-run homer in the third. He became the second-youngest player since 1920 to have a homer and three RBI in his postseason debut. \nArrieta did the rest. \nReally, it wasn’t even fair. \nThe moment Schwarber’s blast landed into the Allegheny River, the Pirates could have brought boat paddles up to the plate, and it wouldn’t have made a difference. \nArrieta gave up a single to Andrew McCutchen in the first inning. And that was the extent of the Pirates’ offense until the sixth inning, when they loaded the bases, only for Arrieta to induce a double play ball from Starling Marte. \nThe Pirates couldn’t touch Arrieta. You knew once he had a 4-0 lead by the fifth inning, the game was over. This is a guy who had given up a combined total of only four runs the last two months, spanning 88 1/3 innings. \nArrieta’s 0.41 ERA since the end of July was the lowest by any pitcher since the stat was even created. \nHe hasn’t given up four runs in a game since June 16, and the way he’s pitching these days, he won’t give up another four runs until June 16, 2018. \nReally, there’s no need for words. The sheer numbers reveal all you need to know: 12-1 with a 0.75 ERA since the All-Star break, the lowest ERA by any pitcher in history. \nLuckily for the Cardinals, they won’t have to see Arrieta until Game 3 of the playoffs, and unless he pulls a Madison Bumgarner, likely only once. \nYet, these Cubs, who won 97 games this year, are playing with such energy and fiery emotion, they’re starting to believe this could be the year when the 107-year World Series drought ends. \nConsidering most of the Cubs’ players were still in junior high the last time they won a postseason game, with their parents not even alive the last time they won the 1945 pennant, they realize what it would mean to their ancestors. \n“I think it matters a lot with the former players,’’ Rizzo said. “There’s a lot of people that have put everything into this organization, and this city, and they call the city of Chicago home. We want to make them proud. \n“I know Ernie (Banks) would be really proud of this team.’’ \nWhile the Cubs move on, hoping to end the mother of all curses, the Pirates are left sitting home, with their postseason lasting all of three hours. \nOnce again. \nThe Pirates won 98 games this year, and have the second-best record in baseball the last three years, but their season lasted just three days longer than the Washington Nationals. \nIt’s almost cruel that a team can be this great, but be eliminated after just one game for a second consecutive season. \nPardon the Pirates if they pick up the telephone and call the Commissioner’s office screaming, pleading that future wild-card games be changed to a best-of-three series. \n“One and done?’’ Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said before the game. “It is what it is. I’m not going to overcook it. For me, this isn’t the time to have the conversation. \n“I’m sure there will be more conversation moving forward, just about how everybody feels.’’ \nEven the Cubs feel badly for the Pirates, questioning the fairness of having the teams with the three best records in baseball, knocking off one another before they even reach the NLCS. \n“It’s a shame,” Rizzo said. \nYet, if someone had to be eliminated, well, the Cubs say, better the Pirates than them. \n“I always liked the idea of a best-out-of-three,’’ Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. “I thought that would be the most appropriate way to do it after a long season. \n“The only time you want a one-and done, is when you win that first game.’’ \nLet the Pirates and others debate it during the long winter. \nThe Cubs have an engagement in St. Louis. \nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:48:50.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
