As the clock ran under two minutes, the drizzle quickly changed to downpour as spectators scurried for cover, leaving the two teams alone in the open. Olpe was deep in the Chase County red zone and head coach Chris Schmidt called a time out. \n“It’s going to rain and it could rain all night,” Redeker said of Schmidt’s words. “But we’re going to drive the ball and keep going.” \nIt was Redeker who ended up with a 2-yard touchdown run and with the following conversion, the Eagles went into the half leading 14-0. \n“The big thing was I just thought if we could finish it off that would be a big, big lift for us,” Schmidt said. “We couldn’t get real fancy there, with a wet ball we just tried to keep it as simple as we could. I give the offensive line great credit. I thought they did a great job all night.” \nOlpe scored once more in the third, as Damon Schmidt hauled in a 32-yard pass from quarterback Ryker Schmidt to go up 22-0. \nChase County followed with its sole scoring drive, as Jake Wessel broke several tackles for a 30-yard touchdown run. \nThe Bulldogs carried the ball 37 times for more than 180 yards, but couldn’t pick up some needed first down chances. \nAndrew Burenheide and Redeker combined for 127 yards on the ground, while Ryker Schmidt also had 48 yards and a 2-yard score. \n“I think this team that we played tonight is better than their record shows,” Coach Schmidt said of the Bulldogs. “They’re a very physical team and we noticed that right away on film. I think the kids had the right idea. We treated it just like a playoff game and that’s what we’ve been doing the last four weeks and continue to try to get better.” \nThough Friday was a non-district game, the Eagles hoped it would help carry them over to their final regular season match, next week in Yates Center, which lost to Lyndon 52-14. \n“We want to finish district undefeated and that’s what’s at stake,” Coach Schmidt said. “We want to go into the playoffs on the right note.” \nCCHS 0 0 6 0 — 6 \nOlpe 0 14 8 6 — 28", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:18:17.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
