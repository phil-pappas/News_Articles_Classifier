It was sold to Triad Capital Partners eight years ago for a skyscraper project that languished during the great recession.\nCity Council candidate Jon Grant is the former director of the Seattle Tenants union. He says a senior vice president of Triad wanted him to get the Tenants Union to end their lawsuit against the project.\nHe says Brett Allen indicated that he could make plans for a $200,000 expenditure against Grant go away, if Grant would help.\nAllen apologized Tuesday for what he called an \"inappropriate\" message.\nI am extremely disappointed by these questionable actions – they do not represent the values of our city. Seattle expects and deserves better,\" Murray said Wednesday.\nMurray said the city has no intention of moving ahead with the project. The city's contract with Triad expires at the end of this year and the contract will not be extended, Murray said.\n“In the meantime, I have asked the City Attorney to explore whether there are any grounds to terminate the contract in a responsible way that does not adversely affect the City or taxpayers, said Murray.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:01:38.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
