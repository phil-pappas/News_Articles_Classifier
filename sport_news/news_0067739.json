Two minutes into his season debut, the Oregon sophomore wide receiver caught a 36-yard touchdown pass from Vernon Adams Jr. to start Oregon’s 26-20 Pac-12 win over Washington at Husky Stadium. “I almost shed a tear, but it was just all smiles,” Carrington said during his first public comments since being suspended by the NCAA for failing a drug test prior to the College Football Playoff championship game in January. “You never know how fast it could be gone, so it was just good to be back out there.” Carrington finished with five catches for 125 yards and two scores against the Huskies to lead the Ducks in each category. Sandwiched around the seven-game suspension, Carrington has 19 catches for 416 yards and five touchdowns in his last three games. That stretch started with the Pac-12 championship game when he had seven catches for 126 yards and a touchdown in a 51-13 win over Arizona. Carrington followed up that performance with seven catches for 165 yards and two touchdowns in a 59-20 win over Florida State in the Rose Bowl. Then came the shocking news that Carrington had to sit out Oregon’s 42-20 loss to Ohio State in the championship game. “People had to make plays and we just didn’t win as a team,” Carrington said. “It felt sad to sit out, but I got over that pretty fast.” The suspension carried over to the first six games of this season as Carrington waited to hear when he could return. “It’s been pretty tough just not being able to be on the field with my team, but I was able to overcome,” he said. “I thank God for helping me get through that and my parents and family, too.” Carrington was able to practice during his suspension, but did not suit up for games. “There was no drop-off,” running back Royce Freeman said. “He’s working in practice and he doesn’t take any plays off. That showed out there. He’s a blessed athlete.” Added defensive lineman Henry Mondeaux: “Darren was amazing. It shows what kind of guy he is. He worked hard and he didn’t take the games off lightly. He didn’t take it as a break, he worked the whole time.” Carrington said he was unsure just how much the Ducks would use him as he worked his way back into the offense midway through the regular season. “It felt good to be playing that much and be back out there,” he said. “I have just been waiting, practicing hard every day and waiting to be cleared.” The 6-foot-2, 195-pound Carrington played for the first time with Adams, but he quickly became the favorite target for the senior transfer quarterback. Carrington had more than one-third of Adams’ 14 completions. “Over the summer, right when he got up there, we’d go to the rec center and after practice we work on stuff,” Carrington said. “We got to be good friends during the summer, so there was a little chemistry there.” Adams' second completion of the night was the first touchdown pass to Carrington and Adams later found him again for a 9-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter that put the Ducks ahead 23-6. “He’s a playmaker and it helps us to get him out there to make plays,” Adams said. Carrington also had catches of 24, 29 and 27 yards. Four of his catches came on third down and each resulted in a first down. “I told Vernon, whenever he is in trouble, he might want to look my way,” Carrington said. Adams did that and Carrington had the performance he wanted in his long-awaited return to the Ducks. “I always appreciated college football, it is good to be out there,” he said. “Under the lights and in front of all the TVs and fans watching, it was good to be back. Whenever I came back, I just wanted to make an impact.” By Steve Mims", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:23:10.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
