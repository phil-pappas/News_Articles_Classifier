And that’s a big deal with No. 1 Bergen Catholic on deck Saturday afternoon in Oradell. \n“We’ve been looking forward to this game since last year,” said senior running back Brian Kearns of North Arlington. “It means a lot to us. The league is on the line. A lot of other stuff is on the line, too, like playoff power points and a playoff position.” \nSt. Joseph (5-2) dropped a 37-34 double-overtime decision to the Crusaders last October. The two teams are tied for first place in the Big North United Division, and the Green Knights went into the weekend two power points ahead of the idle Crusaders in the race for the top seed in Non-Public Group 4. \nThe Green Knights actually spent the first three days last week preparing for Bergen Catholic, and watched film on the Crusaders (4-2) all week. \n“This is going to be as emotional a week as it gets,” said St. Joseph coach Augie Hoffmann. “Being an alum, playing and coaching against them, I’d be lying if I said I haven’t been thinking about this game for the last three weeks.” \nSaturday’s win snapped a two-game losing streak for the Green Knights. Both games came on the road against out-of-state competition, and the players said those contests taught them a lot about this team. \n“I think we learned two things,” said senior running back John Thomas Giles-Harris of West Nyack, N.Y. “After the IMG game (a 24-12 loss), we understood that we can compete with anybody when we play our ‘A’ game. \n“The St. Joseph Prep game [a 28-5 loss] showed us that we can’t just come out on the field and roll over anybody. We are not that kind of team.” \nThe Green Knights didn’t add Silver Oak Academy to its schedule until early September after a long, drawn out bid to add a ninth game. The Rams brought a 26-man roster, comparable in size to an average Group 1 team in North Jersey, but worked hard even though they were overmatched. \nKearns took the first play from scrimmage 80 yards for a touchdown, finishing with 129 yards on eight carries. Giles-Harris carried four times for 41 yards and a touchdown. \nSophomore quarterback Nick Patti threw for 83 yards and a touchdown. Sophomore running back Jordan Scott caught two passes for 64 yards and carried three times for 38 yards. \nThe scariest moment came on St. Joseph’s second possession of the game when Patti took a shot to the ribs while throwing an interception. He was slow getting up, but returned to the game on the Green Knights’ next series. \nAnd now, the Green Knights kick off the stretch run against the team that has long been their biggest rival. \n“We know what we have to do scheme-wise,” Giles-Harris said. “Now we want to know who’s going to come out and play the hardest, run the fastest, make the big hit.” \n“It’s going to be a hell of a test for us,” Hoffmann said.
