The result is that Thompson is now officially a hold out. This doesn't necessarily mean any major changes to the situation, but it does impact the dynamic in some key ways. \nHere are five things to know.\n1. Nothing actually changes. Thompson can still wind up signing the qualifying offer at $6.8 million... the Cavs just have to offer it again. He can sign a one-year deal. He can pursue a deal from another team. All that really changes here is that Thompson no longer has the qualifying offer on the table.\nThe term 'hold out' sounds serious, and this situation isn't great, but it's also not as dramatic as it can be in other sports. The two sides are still presumably working toward a long-term solution to the standoff.\n2. The Cavaliers have all the leverage. Thompson is out of options. If the Cavaliers want, they can go back and halve their offer. Thompson's only leverage was the threat he'd sign the qualifying offer and become an unrestricted free agent in 2016. With that off the table, there's nothing really he can do. His only leverage is not being in camp.\nAnd that's a real problem for a team with an All-Star power forward and multiple quality veteran big men. Oh, wait, no, it's not a problem at all. Thompson had better hope Rich Paul can pull another rabbit out of his hat.\n3. Speaking of Rich Paul, he doesn't look great. The youngster super agent has been lauded for how he handled Eric Bledsoe 's negotiations last summer, but Bledsoe wound up without the max deal he wanted, though he did get big money. Thompson wanted the max... no dice, it seems.\nPaul and Thompson turned down big money deals earlier in the year and again this summer, believing his performance in the Cavs' Finals run made him worth the investment. Cleveland refused to blink and now they're largely out of options. Not an ideal situation.\n4. A long-term deal is still possible. The Cavs would still likely rather have Thompson locked up long-term, they just want it at the price they want. Thompson clearly wants the security of a multi-year deal or he would have just taken the qualifying offer.\nThe Cavs may have all the cards, but a realistic and reasonable solution is still possible in the next few days that can make both sides happy.\n5. LeBron James is probably starting to get annoyed, which isn't good for anyone involved. James said during the playoffs last year Thompson should be a Cavalier for life. They share an agent. James has made it clear the Cavs should take care of him. Other than that he's stayed out of it for the most part, but at some point, James is going to want Thompson on the court.\nWhoever he calls to end it, hearing from James about this situation is probably something both sides want to avoid to prevent facing the King's wrath. Tristan Thompson's probably pretty mad at his free agency process.
