Since my father passed away over a year ago, my mother is in charge and she makes all the decisions.\" \nMartha Ford has represented the Lions at league meetings over the past year and been a visible presence at games both home and on the road. \nLions coach Jim Caldwell said Thursday that the 90-year-old Ford was in New York for a one-day owners meeting this week and gave the league \"a piece of her mind\" over a blown officiating call in Monday's 13-10 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. \n\"Don't think that Mrs. Ford is not upset,\" Caldwell on 97.1-FM. \"Don't think that she doesn't tell them to give them a piece of her mind, because she's there at the league meetings this week or yesterday and without question that's done.\" \nFord has spoken publicly about the Lions just once since she took over as the Lions' primary owner after her husband, William Clay Ford, died last March. \nShe said this spring that she involves all four of her children - Ford Jr., Martha Ford Morse, Sheila Ford Hamp and Elizabeth Ford Kontulis - in organizational decisions, and all four are as listed as vice chairs on the team's official website. \nFord Jr., the executive chairman of Ford Motor Company, also serves on the NFL's prestigious broadcast committee. But he said his mother is in charge of the Lions. \n\"She is,\" he said. \"And since my dad died I've been less involved with the Lions and the NFL, but she is very much in charge and she's got the decision making role.\" \nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.
