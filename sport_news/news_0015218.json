Both the 5K run and one-mile run start at 9 a.m., with registration open until 8:30 a.m. The Ridgefield Golf Course Improvement Fund is presenting the event as a fund-raiser for the course. The run starts at the course and, this year, heads out directly to the course (route all within the golf course) with a finish up the 16th through 18th fairways to the clubhouse. T-shirts will go to the first 150 entrants. Registration is available online at Active.com or the course’s website, ridgefieldgc.com. For more information, call 203-748-7008. Last year, first-time entrant Kevin Boughan set a course record on a windy day . His time of 18:31 over the 3.1-mile course was an improvement over last year’s winning time of 20:41 by Scott Persampieri, who was second this year in 19:11. The female winner was Hannah Hirsch in 24:03. The event attracted nearly 100 runners and walkers in 30-plus MPH winds ripping across the high ridge that the course sits on along Ridgebury Road. The run and walk is a benefit for the course and was organized by the Ridgefield Golf Course Improvement Fund. More than $2,000 was raised and will go directly to improvements along the course. The walk route took participants past the several sand trap improvements that have been made since the group formed three years ago.
