We still made mistakes, gifting goals a little bit, but we'll fix that.\"\nThe Leafs dressed mostly veterans, with only prospects Zach Hyman and Kasperi Kapanen in the lineup. The 23-year-old Hyman had 13:23 of ice time and recorded one shot on net. Kapanen, 19, played 14:44 and earned an assist on Arcobello's power-play goal.\nHyman, who Babcock became familiar with when the forward played for the University of Michigan, impressed his coach with his style of play against the Wings.\n\"I thought he was great tonight,\" said Babcock. \"Tonight he reminded me of when he was at Michigan. I thought he was one of our better players. ... Hyman skates so good and plays heavy, he could be effective.\"\nVan Riemsdyk put the Leafs ahead just 1:09 into the game. Abdelkader responded just over a minute later and Miller gave the Wings a 2-1 lead at the 5:21 mark.\nArcobello tied the game on the power play at 19:28 of the second period before Zetterberg put Detroit ahead for good 3:57 into the third. Richards added an empty-net goal to seal the win.\nDetroit went 0 for 2 on the power play while Toronto scored once on two chances with the man advantage.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:06:53.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
