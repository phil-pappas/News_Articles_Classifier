Unbelievable energy from the fans,” said Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin, a Canadian.\n“This is awesome. Words can’t describe the feelings inside me.”\nThe Blue Jays — whose squad includes Aussie relief pitcher Liam Hendriks — will meet Kansas City in the championship series after the Royals secured a 3-2 series win over Houston.\nJose Bautista proved the difference for the Blue Jays. Source: Reuters\nTrailing 3-2 on Thursday, the Blue Jays drew level when Josh Donaldson grounded into a bases loaded fielder’s choice.\nThat set the stage for 34-year-old Dominican outfielder Bautista’s decisive blast.\n“For intensity and emotion, it was the most emotionally charged game I have ever played,” Bautista said.\n“There was so much stuff going on. It was just the whole game, a do or die game. It was just the moment. I felt it. I did it. I’m just glad I was able to hit the heck out of the ball.”\nRangers leadoff batter Delino DeShields opened with a double, took third base on a Shin-Soo Choo’s ground out and scored when Prince Fielder grounded into a fielder’s choice.\nChoo then smashed his second career playoff homer in the third inning to put the Rangers ahead 2-0.\nStar Texas second baseman Rougned Odor can believe his team blew a late lead. Source: AFP\nBut the Blue Jays answered when Ben Revere scored from second on a Bautista double in the third inning and Edwin Encarnacion blasted a solo homer to level up in the sixth.\nIn the seventh, Texas second baseman Rougned Odor singled, advanced to third on two ground outs and scored on one of the most bizarre plays of this or any season.\nToronto catcher Martin was throwing the ball back to pitcher Aaron Sanchez when it struck Choo’s bat as he stood in the batter’s box. The ball dribbled onto the field and Odor, realising the ball was in play, raced home as the stunned Toronto fielders and fans looked on, umpires ruling he has scored the go-ahead run for the Rangers.\nAs supporters tossed bottles onto the field, the Blue Jays protested the call and the game but the decision stood, television replays showing the routine toss back to the mound deflected off Choo’s bat, an error on Martin.\n“I just caught the ball and threw it back very casually,” Martin said.\n“It hit his bat and they scored. I don’t know the rule. I had never had that happen before.\nUnbelievable 7th inning in MLB play-off series 1:47 MLB: In one of the craziest innings in MLB play-off history a lengthy review decision hands Texas a controversial lead at the top of the 7th inning, only to see the Toronto Blue Jays hit back thanks to several unforced errors from Rangers fielders\nOctober 15th 2015 6 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ “You can either feel sorry for yourself or try and do something about it. We did something about it, capitalised on a couple mistakes and that’s what won us the game.”\nTexas brought the tying run to the plate in the eighth but Toronto relief pitcher Roberto Osuna struck out Josh Hamilton and Elvis Andrus to end the inning. He also struck out pinch hitters Mike Napoli and Will Venable in the ninth for the final two outs of the game.\n Video: Bat flip caps off wild Blue Jays win", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F15%2FDVU_MLB_TOR_TEX_INSANE_7TH_INNING.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/22ef1cc0b5e426c03ef70658c8db422b", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/more-sports/mlb-playoffs-jose-bautista-hits-three-run-homer-as-toronto-blue-jays-beat-texas-rangers/story-fni2frsp-1227569927821", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F15%2FDVU_151015_MLB_BAUTISTAS_3_RUN_HOMER_PKG.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e9129411d78a407021658d6176820b18", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/20ce340dc1aeb9761192ddf7a5628600", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:28:52.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
