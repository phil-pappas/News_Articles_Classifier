(AP) - New York's Fort Ticonderoga is getting some help showing off its big guns.\nThe historic site and tourist destination overlooking the southern end of Lake Champlain announced Thursday that it has received a $150,000 grant from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services.\nThe funding from the agency's \"Museums for America\" program will be used to re-interpret and exhibit the fort's extensive collection of 18th-century artillery. Officials at the fort say their museum's collection of cannons and other artillery is the largest and most significant of its kind in North America.\nThe grant will help the fort re-install cannons along the wall and restore several other key artillery pieces.\nA major highlight of the fort since it was reconstructed in the early 20th century, the artillery collection will be the focus of a new exhibit in 2016.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:15:14.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
