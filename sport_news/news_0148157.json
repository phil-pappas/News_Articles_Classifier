Because, beginning next year, it won’t be quite the same. \nCedar Rapids Jefferson Athletics Director Chris Deam said Tuesday that the area’s biggest and best tournament will be downsized, beginning in 2016. \n“We just want to run at at one site,” Deam said. “It’s such a long delay after pool play, getting teams to and from (Cedar Rapids) Washington (for bracket play). There’s just a few logistical problems.” \nThus, the tournament, which has been a 24-team showcase for decades, will be carved to a 16-team event next fall. \n“If I could build a six-court practice facility, that would be great. I’d love to keep this at 24 teams. But it will run so much easier if it’s all at one place.” \nTraditionally, four pools have been played at Jefferson, two at Washington. Then, after all the transportation is complete, the Gold and Silver brackets are contested at Jefferson, the Bronze at Washington. \nSo, who gets the axe? \n“Good question,” Deam said. “I’ve inquired with all the ADs, and only one school is OK with getting out. One thing we need to look at — there are nine MVC schools here, and we don’t want to run a mini-MVC tournament, especially since the real MVC tournament is the following Saturday. So we’ll probably start our cuts there. \n“The point of the tournament is to play teams you don’t normally see, but to keep a high level of competition.” \nThis year’s tournament is loaded as usual; 16 of the 24 teams are listed in the most recent state rankings. Dike-New Hartford is the defending champion; West Des Moines Dowling is the overall No. 1 seed. \nPool play begins at 8:30 a.m.; bracket action is scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. \nCROWN THEM \nCedar Rapids Kennedy wrapped up its first outright MVC championship in school history Tuesday, sweeping Dubuque Senior. \nThe Class 5A sixth-rated Cougars improved to 18-6 overall and finished 6-0 in Valley Division play. Kennedy shared a divisional title in 2006. \nMacy Anderson collected 11 kills and posted a .500 kill efficiency Tuesday. Brinley Milbrath added seven kills and Anna Fluent distributed 30 assists. \nKennedy is one of three area teams to have a divisional title in tow. \n* West Branch swept West Liberty in a River Valley Conference South Division winner-take-all encounter Tuesday. The Bears (24-1, 6-0) have won 20 consecutive matches. \n* North Cedar (22-6, 5-0) is the RVC North champion. \n* In addition, Marion (20-4, 6-0) clinched a share of the Wamac Conference West Division crown Tuesday when it swept South Tama. The Indians can own it outright with a win at home against Williamsburg next Tuesday. \nHAHN IS HEADED TO THE HALL \nFormer Cedar Rapids Kennedy all-state libero Kristen Hahn is one of three players who will be inducted into the IGHSAU Volleyball Hall of Fame this year. \nA 2010 Kennedy graduate, Hahn helped lead the Cougars to the state semifinals twice. \nShe blossomed at Iowa State University, becoming a two-time second-team AVCA all-American and the Big 12 libero of the year three times. \nHahn will be joined in the IGHSAU Hall Class of 2015 by Chelsey Semprini of Ankeny (2009) and Lacey Corcoran of Johnston (1999). Induction ceremonies will be during the championship round of the state tournament Friday, Nov. 13, at the U.S. Cellular Center. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:41:42.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
