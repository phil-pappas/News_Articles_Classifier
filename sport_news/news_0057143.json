Borough Solicitor   Tuesday that the borough had not been served with papers relating to the suit and that he had no comment on the case. \nRomutis, of Conway, Beaver County, was hired in December 2010 by a split vote of council. He was removed in May 2014 after the borough council eliminated the police chief's position. At the time of his hiring,   said the borough should have another patrolman rather than a chief, who is prohibited by the police union contract from performing patrol duties. \nSince the police chief position was eliminated, Lt. David Kingston, the department's ranking officer, has assumed many of the department's administrative duties, but is permitted to patrol and investigate incidents. Sgt. Michael McBride, the department's canine handler who was promoted this year, is second-in-command. \nAccording to the court documents, Romutis is making four general accusations against the borough -- breach of contract, public policy violation, breach of implied covenant, and interference with prospective economic advantage. He is seeking $35,000 in damages for each of the four counts. \nThe centerpiece of Romutis' first three allegations is that he signed a contract that allows the borough to dismiss him for several reasons, including failure to perform his job, conduct unbecoming of a police chief, being intoxicated on duty, or a conviction of certain crimes. In the documents, Romutis' attorney, David Trautman of Pittsburgh, said financial or budgetary reasons were not among the list of justifications for dismissing the police chief. \nAmong the allegations in Romutis' fourth accusation -- that Ellwood City is interfering with his \"prospective economic advantage.\" The former chief said he applied for a police chief position in Hopewell Township and to be a full-time instructor at Community College of Beaver County, and was rejected for both jobs. \nRomutis said he was qualified for both positions but was rejected without serious consideration. He was police chief in Ambridge when hired in Ellwood City and previously was a lieutenant, SWAT team supervisor and zone commander for the Pittsburgh police department. \nHe claimed that Ellwood City \"blackballed\" him from gaining employment elsewhere. Since being dismissed in the borough, Romutis said his only work has been as an adjunct professor at the University of Pittsburgh, a position he held while working in Ellwood City. \nLeymarie said the borough paid Romutis six months salary after the police chief position was eliminated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:06:17.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
