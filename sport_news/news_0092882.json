The tournament, formerly called the Frys.com Open, will be played Oct. 13-16 at the Silverado Resort and Spa in Napa, Calif.\n\"It's a dream come true,\" said Sanders, a graduate of Sunset High School and the University of Oregon. \"It's been 30 years in the business since we started the Fred Meyer Challenge. I went to work in that event in the fall of 1985, and here it is the fall of 2015 and we've got our first PGA Tour event that we're going to manage. We're really thrilled about it.\"\nSanders has a long-standing relationship with Safeway's parent company, Albertsons, which has been the long-time sponsor of the Albertsons Boise Open, a top Web.com Tour tournament that Sanders' company has run for 26 years. Sanders also has run charity events in Chicago and Scottsdale, Arizona, for Albertsons, as well as a long-running regional TV show that pitted teams from different courses against one another, the \"Alberstons Northwest Team Championship.\"\n\"That's a huge part of it, that we have that relationship,\" Sanders said.\nAnother key to securing the deal was Sanders' friendship with Johnny Miller, the Hall of Fame golfer and NBC commentator. Miller grew up at Silverado and lived at the resort during his PGA Tour heyday in the 1970s and '80 and is now a part owner of the resort.\n\"Johnny called me about this opportunity six or seven months ago, that Frys might not want to go forward after this year, and there might be an opening for us to come in and do a tournament if we can find a sponsor,\" Sanders said.\nMiller will serves as host of the Safeway Open, taking on a role similar to the one Jack Nicklaus has at The Memorial and Arnold Palmer has at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill.\n\"It's pretty exciting for him, too, that he has a PGA Tour event that he's going to be the host of,\" Sanders said.\nSanders' company has run 31 Web.com Tour events, including the WinCo Foods Portland Open that held its second staging at Pumpkin Ridge in August. Sanders started his company in 1989 as Jeff Sanders Promotions. It went under the umbrella of Lagardere in 2014 , when what was then called Lagardere Unlimited Golf purchased JSP. Sanders and his staff continue to run events for what is now called Lagardere Sports out of its Beaverton office.\n\"When they acquired our company, one of the first things they wanted us to do was get a PGA Tour event,\" Sanders said.\nSafeway sponsored Portland's annual LPGA Tour event for 18 years before the relationship ended in 2013. That came under different corporate structure, before Albertsons bought Safeway in January.\nSafeway continues to run stores under its own name, and its corporate offices are in Pleasanton, California, about an hour from Napa. Safeway has 244 stores in Northern California.\nThe Safeway Open will be the opening tournament of the PGA Tour's \"wrap-around\" 2016-17 season, the first at which golfers can gain FedExCup points and earn a Masters invitation with a victory. The post-FedExCup fall tournaments were once seen as afterthoughts, but Sanders believes having them start a new season has helped raise their profile.\nThis year's Frys.com Open drew such name players as Rory McIlroy, Brandt Snedeker, Hunter Mahan, Angel Cabrera and Webb Simpson.\n\"A lot of guys are going to be playing in the fall now because they don't want to start in January and February on the West Coast and be way down on the money list,\" Sanders said. \"That puts a little bit of panic in you if you show up in January or February and you're 100 th or 200 th on the money list.\"\n-- Mike Tokito\nmtokito@oregonian.com\n503-294-7604; @mtokito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mtokito"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:07:28.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
