The Dodge City Red Demons gave the Wichita city league champions everything they had in the start of district play Friday night but in the matchup of two explosive offenses, it was Wichita Northwest’s (7-0) defense who were able to slow down the Red Demons in the 52-33 loss. After both teams entered the halftime break tied at 28-28, Northwest outscored the Red Demons 24-5 in the second half. Dodge City was able to move the ball through the air but when they needed to run the ball, the athletic Northwest defense showed why they have made it tough for teams all season long. \"We struggled to find an identity offensively,\" head coach Dave Foster said on the radio following the game. \"We couldn’t run the football. When you can’t run the football, I’m not sure you can win games. That puts tremendous pressure on (quarterback) Caden (Walters) and our offensive line.\" Walters threw the ball nearly 70 times on Friday and completed over 50 perfect of his passes. In his final game at Memorial Stadium, Walters threw two touchdown passes and ran for one more. Senior defensive end Noah Williams intercepted quarterback Jake Devereaux and returned it 85 yards for a Red Demon touchdown in the second quarter which gave Dodge City a 21-14. It was the first of two turnovers that the Red Demons forced in the game. Dodge City (4-3, 3-0) will head to Hutchinson next Friday for their second district game. Both the Red Demons and the Salthawks lost their first game of district play. Despite the loss to Northwest, there were positives that the Red Demons can take away from Friday’s game. \"A year ago we weren’t even in the game at the half and tonight we’re tied up,\" Foster said. \"That’s the number one team in the state. We gave ourselves a chance to compete to win. I told the kids that you played with some tremendous heart.\" Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. next Friday.
