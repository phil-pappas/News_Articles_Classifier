In last Sunday's loss to Atlanta, Claiborne was Dallas' best when it came to defending Julio Jones.\nClaiborne was in coverage on Jones for eight targets, most of any Cowboys defender. Claiborne held the two-time Pro Bowler to four catches for 41 yards.\n\"I think he is playing really good,\" Cowboys defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli said. \"I mean he is playing really good man-to-man technique. And he is tackling, making plays. We're pleased with where he's at.\"\nMore Cowboys coverage Ã‚ Latest news, opinion, analysis\nGeorge: Lance Dunbar, Cowboys' Darren Sproles starter kit, will return to play in hometown New Orleans\nCowboys' Jeremy Mincey regrets playing with concussion: Family is 'team' I should play for\nBob Sturm: On the offensive line's struggles; on Brandon Weeden's short throws\nQB Tony Romo does light cardio work\nBob Sturm: What kind of impact Greg Hardy will have when he returns; is Terrance Williams a No. 2 WR?\nRB Lance Dunbar: Sitting back and watching for a couple years made me a better person\nCowboys Q&A: Tyler Clutts explains rookie songs, being in chess club, the weird things his son eats and more\nChristine Michael in the mix to be on Cowboys' active roster\nSportsDay experts, more give their Week 4 NFL picks\nDo the Dallas Cowboys have a quarterback controversy?\nTerrell Owens is still waiting for Jerry Jones to call about that Cowboys comeback\nSturm's Xs and Os: How Cowboys made Julio Jones' 45-yard TD easier and more\n10 things you might not know about Lance Dunbar, including how he ended up at North Texas\nCowboys send RB Joseph Randle message after his career day\nWashington basketball star still has soft spot for Cowboys\nWhat players, coaches, execs, opponents say Travis Frederick: Doesn't matter if QB is back there making a sandwich, we have to hold our blocks\nCowboys WR Terrance Williams takes responsibility for disappearing act, says 'there are no excuses'\nCowboys' Brandon Weeden never thought he'd ever be asked if he checks down too much\nSaints coach Sean Payton: Cowboys might be lacking 'spaghetti sauce' element without Tony Romo\nStephen Jones: We're not trying to hold on, we're trying to win games\nSaints RB Mark Ingram: 'Anytime you get a chance to play the Cowboys it's always a big deal'\nFun stuff\nFantasy football: Time to grab Cowboys' Lance Dunbar\nCowboys fans tear into Brandon Weeden in Top 25 fan-made memes\nNeed a laugh after the game?
