F&M (5-1, 4-1) then took 3:53 off the clock. \nMcDaniel cut the deficit to 30-28 when Koester threw a 37-yard touchdown to a wide-open Marquise Findley-Smith with 1:03 to go. But the Green Terror's onside kick attempt failed, and the Dips ran out the final minute in victory formation. \n\"We go down early, we've been there before, we know how to fight our way back,\" McDaniel wide receiver Mike Oliveto said. \"It's unfortunate we didn't have enough time to finish what we started.\" DAVE MUNCH/STAFF PHOTO / Carroll County Times McDaniel quarterback Will Koester looks to pass against F&M in Westminster Saturday, Oct. 17.

Perry Stefanelli scored on a 4-yard run to make it 23-14 with 3:49 to go in the quarter. \nBut just 16 seconds later, the Diplomats responded on the first play of their next drive following a great return, as Tanner Erisman threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Bobby Keyes, pushing the lead to 30-14. \nMcDaniel immediately bounced back, however. On the second play of its ensuing drive, Koester hit Oliveto in stride down the left sidelines. Oliveto then sprinted downfield for a 75-yard score that cut it to 30-21. \nOliveto had eight catches for 131 yards. That type of performance from the fifth-year senior is nothing new, however. What was new for the Green Terror's offense was Koester, who impressed coach Mike Hoyt in all facets of the game. \n\"He was taking command of the offense, he was barking signals, he was keeping guys organized,\" Hoyt said. \"He didn't panic in tight situations, and that's what you want from a quarterback, a guy who's cool and calm when the pressure's on.\" \nIn the first quarter alone, the Terror were outgained by the Diplomats 160-38. Koester was 1 for 5 for five yards in the first 15 minutes. McDaniel couldn't even capitalize on its opening drive when it started at the F&M 49-yard line. That resulted in a missed 47-yard field goal attempt by Mike Casper. \nMcDaniel got on the board just before halftime, when Koester threw a 1-yard scoring pass to Taylor Wagner. It was the first touchdown for both sophomores in their Terror careers. \nThe Diplomats scored on each of their first three possessions. Quarterback Matt Magarity ran for a 14-yard touchdown, then threw an 8-yard score to David Shellhammer out of the backfield to make it 13-0 less than 11 minutes in. \nShellhammer pushed the Dips' lead to 20-0 in the second quarter, scoring on a 14-yard run with 11 minutes, 55 seconds until halftime. \nThe Diplomats scored 23 points in the first half, amassing 300 yards of offense. They were 6 for 9 on third-down conversions and scored all four times from the red zone. \nBut McDaniel held F&M to just seven points and 89 yards in the second half. Andy Ullman had 11 tackles, including two sacks, while Garvin Brooms also collected 11 tackles. \n\"We made some mistakes defensively and made some adjustments at halftime,\" Hoyt said. \"I think it made a difference. We had some breakdowns in the secondary again, so we have to fix that. I have to fix that, keep working with those guys.\" \nMcDaniel goes on the road to take on Dickinson next week, beginning a stretch of three straight games against teams in the bottom half of the Centennial Conference standings. \nIt is unknown if Callahan will be healthy enough to back under center for the Green Terror against the Red Devils. And even if he is, Koester may have done enough to get his opportunity to keep running the offense. \n\"We'll be talking about that as a staff [Sunday] morning when we get together and what we want to do from there,\" said Hoyt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:02:54.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
