Sheldon Richardson acts like Rex Ryan is still the head coach of the New York Jets.\nAdChoices The third-year pro, fresh off his four-game suspension, has now twice issued a verbal assault against the New England Patriots. He first sounded off after the Jets took down Washington on Sunday, saying he and his teammates were “ licking their chops ” to face the Pats.\nThen on Thursday after practice he opened up his trap once again and guaranteed a win for Gang Green.\n“ This is going to be another win for us . We’ll let you all write the columns about validating wins and stuff like that. This is going to be another win in the win column if we got out there and execute and do what we’re supposed to do,” Richardson said, via Kristian Dyer of Metro.com.\nIt’s understandable that the Jets are feeling confident, entering Week 7 with a record of 4-1. However, it is inadvisable to give the Patriots bulletin board material once, let alone twice in the same week leading up to a rivalry game that needs nothing extra to stay fierce.\nBut it’s especially inadvisable when the boasts are coming from a young player who missed the first four games of the season due to a positive drug test .\nThe Patriots, and specifically quarterback Tom Brady, are notorious for making their enemies pay when they feel slighted. Undoubtedly they’ll be happy to make sure Richardson and the Jets remember why they’ve been the little brother in the AFC rivalry for some time now.\nExpect a big win for Brady and Co. at home this Sunday.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/10/sheldon-richardson-jets-licking-our-chops-to-take-on-the-patriots-in-week-7/", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/07/jets-dl-sheldon-richardson-suspended-four-games-for-violating-substance-abuse-policy/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.metro.us/sports/sheldon-richardson-guarantees-a-jets-win-at-patriots/zsJojv---MtxjMZPqvaYu2/"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:54:16.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
