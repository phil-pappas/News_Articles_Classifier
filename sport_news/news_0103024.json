Marie Evening News - Sault Ste. Marie, MI By ISIAHOTTEN Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 11:37 AM By ISIAHOTTENFor The Evening News Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 11:37 AM RUDYARD — DeTour defeated Rudyard in a closely contested Eastern UPConference volleyball match up Tuesday night in four sets. All four sets were neck and neck the whole way, but the DeTour Trojans’ fierce offense overcame the Rudyard Bulldogs’ efficient defense. “We worked really hard all season to stay under control and work as one team and not let outside things get in the way,” said DeTour coach Sara Galarowic. “That’s been our focus all season and I think that’s coming together really well this season.” Despite the tight nature of the sets, DeTour secured the first two wins, 20-25 and 22-25. Junior Sarah Melvin set the pace for the Trojans, scoring 6 kills and connecting 3 blocks in these first two sets. The third set started off in much the same way with the two team’s jockeying for the lead, but the scrappy Bulldog defense put some points together and were able to keep their hopes alive. They distanced themselves from DeTour at the last opportunity and won it 25-22. The fourth set was tight, but in a completely different way. For much of the first half, the two teams had streaks of points and took decent leads. DeTour first led 2-5, then Rudyard led 8-6, but before long DeTour led 10-14. Just when DeTour seemed to have Rudyard on the ropes at 17-23, the Bulldogs put on a stellar defensive, helped along with a few lucky breaks, to force a win-by-two at 24-24. The 24th point by Rudyard summed up their momentum, with a wicked swing from sophomore Hannah Beelen who hit the ball on a course for out-of-bounds, but pinged a Trojan for the point. Tough play and a lucky break. “Hannah Beelen was strong at the net tonight,” said Perry. “Six kills and four block-kills. Excellent considering how hard DeTour’s hitters are.” But DeTour wasn’t shaken and won the set-match 25-27. “All close games. Who knows if we had had the fifth set what would have happened,” said Perry. “Our passing really took the wind out of us. DeTour has some extremely good servers, so we wouldn’t pass the ball and then had to play back from that.” Beelen led the Bulldogs in kills and blocks, but she was supported by an iron-curtain defense: four Bulldogs were in double-digits for digs – both a testament to Rudyard’s defense as much as DeTour’s offense. Jorgy Trotter, Lane Clegg, and Mackenzie Knutsen earned 27, 25, and 21 digs respectively, while libero Jordan Spring earned 15. But the match went to DeTour who put up impressive stats. Sarah Bailey led her team in with 11 kills and 4 blocks, supported by Madison Wilkie at the net with 2 blocks and 5 kills. Page 2 of 2 - “It was a team effort, but I think Madison and Sarah really stepped up huge tonight,” said Galarowic. “Sarah and Madison both got some big blocks when we needed them the most and some great hustle plays by my outsides coming after balls they never should have reached. I’m really happy with our teamwork.” Also with significant stats were Kaalin Crawford with 15 assists, 2 kills, and 6 serve aces as well as sophomore Hallie Grzesiek with 7 kills and 3 digs. Rudyard won the junior varsity match, 3-0. By ISIAHOTTEN Sault Ste. Marie Evening News - Sault Ste.
