Johansen has scored 33 and 26 goals the past two seasons and had six points— one goal, five assists — in seven games before the coaching change.\nSome thought former Jackets first-rounder Derick Brassard would wilt under Tortorella’s methods when they were together with the New York Rangers, but Brassard blossomed instead.\n \nLast week, 2016 point guard prospect Tyson Carter from Starksville, Miss., was planning to take an official visit to Ohio State during the weekend when his coach and father, Greg, got a phone call.\n“We were supposed to visit last weekend, but the visit got canceled last Thursday,” he said. “ They called us and told us they had gotten a commitment from a kid.”\nCarter said the Buckeyes did not tell him who had committed but that when they entered the picture for his son in July they said they had one spot for two players. The other candidate is Kobi Simmons, a national top-20 recruit from Alpharetta, Ga.\n“They were real upfront with us from the beginning that they were recruiting two guards, (Tyson) and one other kid, and they were only taking one,” Carter said.\nBut a source said Simmons has not committed to Ohio State. He has three schools as finalists — Ohio State, Kentucky and UNLV — and has taken official visits to each of them.\n \nRunning back prospect Kareem Walker will play tonight in Ohio, but questions remain over whether he will play next season for Ohio State.\nWalker and his teammates from Wayne, N.J., are scheduled to play at Cincinnati Elder. Rated the No. 1 running back in the nation by Rivals for the 2016 recruiting cycle, Walker committed to the Buckeyes in January, the night the team won the national championship.\nIn recent weeks, though, he has visited Michigan, Alabama, Mississippi and Arizona State before wrapping up his recruiting journey with an official visit to Ohio State, probably in December.\nHe plans to enroll in January at the school of his choice, and in a statement he issued this week, he wrote, “I’m committed to Ohio State.” He said the visits he’s making are “to confirm I am making the right choice for my future.”\n \nWith Crew SC playing Sunday at Mapfre Stadium against D.C. United in a game that will determine whether the Crew gets a first-round bye in the playoffs or must play a knockout game next week, club officials have been working hard to get a big, enthusiastic crowd.\nA video of coach Gregg Berhalter urging fans to be loud was posted on the club’s website on Wednesday, and he did an interview on WCOL-FM (92.3) Thursday morning. About the same time, midfielder Ethan Finlay made an appearance on WTTE-TV (Ch. 28).\nA win on Sunday could be the key to the team’s postseason success. Because of its sometimes porous defense, the Crew is probably better suited for a two-game, aggregate series than to take a chance on an off night against a talented offensive team in a one-game knockout.\n \nBig Ten Network’s Tom Dienhart pointed out that, in the event of a three-way tie for the East Division title among Ohio State, Michigan and Michigan State, those teams wouldn’t find out which would play in the football championship game until the Tuesday before kickoff.\nIn Dienhart’s example, Ohio State beats Michigan State and loses to Michigan. All three teams win the rest of their games and finish 7-1 in conference play. The first tiebreaker — the records vs. one another — wouldn’t settle anything; all three would be 1-1.\nThe next three tiebreakers wouldn’t be relevant, either, taking us to the fifth tiebreaker — the team highest in the College Football Playoff rankings. That would decide it unless the teams are within one spot of each other, in which case it would go to the team beat the other in the regular season.\nThe playoff rankings are released at 7 p.m. on Tuesdays, which would be three days after the final regular-season games.\nThis isn’t just a Big Ten problem. The Pac-12 and Atlantic Coast conferences have the same tiebreakers. College Football Playoff executive director Bill Hancock told Dienhart that the release of the rankings wouldn’t be moved up to accommodate a conference in such a situation.\n \nWhen the Miami University men’s hockey team visited Ohio State on Friday, RedHawks coach Enrico Blasi started his three Columbus-area players — Sean Kuraly of Dublin and Jack Roslovic and Kiefer Sherwood of Columbus.\nThink Blasi might also have been tweaking Ohio State a little? Maybe. Roslovic scored the winning goal with 1:33 to play in a 3-2 victory, then scored the go-ahead goal against the winless Buckeyes in a 3-1 victory on Saturday in Oxford.\nBob Hunter is a sports columnist for The Dispatch. \nbhunter@dispatch.com \n@dailyhunter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:56:57.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
