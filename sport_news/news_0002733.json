Ole Miss has won 48 of the teams’ 60 games, with Memphis taking only 10 (the teams tied in 1985 and 1963). \nAfter several years off, the rivalry was renewed last year, with a 24-3 Rebel win in Oxford. Prior to that, the teams had not played since 2009, also a Rebels win. \nThe Tigers have not beaten Ole Miss since 2004. That win topped off back-to-back wins by the DeAngelo Williams-led Tigers over the University of Mississippi. \nAs for 2015, Memphis enters the game with an unblemished 5-0 record, including conference wins over Cincinnati and South Florida. The Tigers will enter with the advantage of a bye week last week for a bit of extra preparation. \nOle Miss, however, faced less-than-stellar competition last week in New Mexico State. The Rebs rolled over the Aggies 52-3 to improve to a 5-1 record that includes a highly impressive win over then-#2 Alabama, but also includes a devastating 38-10 blowout loss at Florida. \nBoth teams enter with high-scoring offenses. The Tigers are averaging 47.8 points per game and have relied on that through some shaky defensive performances in which they surrendered 41 points to Bowling Green and 46 to Cincinnati. The Rebels are right behind them at 46.8 points per game of offense, but their defense has held up a bit better aside from surrendering 37 and 38 to Alabama and Florida, respectively. \nTigers head coach Justin Fuente believes the Rebel defense will be tough to crack. \n\"There's just things you can't do that you could do against other teams,\" Fuente said. \"We have to go in as a staff and see if we can come up with the right scheme or something just to give us a chance.\" \nBoth teams can boast strong quarterback play, with the Rebs backed by Chad “Swag” Kelly and the Tigers by Paxton Lynch. Kelly has completed 64% of his passes for 14 touchdowns and 5 interceptions, while Lynch has yet to throw a pick, strengthened by his 70% completion percentage with 10 touchdowns. \nOle Miss head coach High Freeze is concerned about how his team will stop Lynch. \n\"They're playing with great confidence, and they have what all of us want, a really great quarterback.\" \nOle Miss enters the game as 10.5 point favorites, but those who have watched the Tigers recently may be quick to point out that the Rebels are on “upset alert.” Memphis is riding a school-record 13 game winning streak that ranks third in the nation behind Ohio State and TCU (both top 5 teams). \nHowever, the Tigers have not beaten an SEC team since the aforementioned victory over Ole Miss in 2004. They have beaten just one Power 5 conference school during their win streak, a 55-23 beatdown over winless Kansas in September. \nThe Tigers will play only American Athletic Conference rivals after Saturday and stand a fair chance at winning double digit games for a second straight year after having never done so before 2014. It's even more impressive if you consider the Tigers won just 12 games combined from 2009-2013. \nThe Tigers and Rebels kick off at 11 a.m. Saturday at the liberty Bowl. \nCopyright 2015 WMC Action News 5.
