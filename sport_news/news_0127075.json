FIFA's appeal committee is chaired by Larry Mussenden of Bermuda.\nPlatini was quick to receive the resounding backing of his European confederation on Thursday and now CONMEBOL has denounced the former France captain's ban as \"untimely and disproportionate.\"\n\"The presumption of innocence is a fundamental right that has to be considered,\" CONMEBOL said in a statement on its website. \"Mr. Platini has not been found guilty of any charge, therefore the provisional ban jeopardizes the integrity of the electoral process to the FIFA presidency, of which Mr. Platini is a candidate.\"\nAlthough Platini's ban expires before the scheduled election date, he is unlikely to pass FIFA integrity checks after the Oct. 26 deadline for the submission of candidacies.\n\"(CONMEBOL) urges that the provisional ban imposed upon Mr. Platini be reconsidered, and that Mr. Platini be allowed, with full guarantees and without impairing his rights, to continue as FIFA presidential candidate,\" the Paraguay-based confederation said. \"These are trying times that demand an integral reform of FIFA.\n\"(CONMEBOL) fully believes in Mr. Platini's capacity to lead FIFA and the football world towards a brighter future.\"\nAlthough FIFA quickly named an acting president — Issa Hayatou — as required by its statues, UEFA has not elevated its senior vice president — Angel Maria Villar — to temporarily fill Platini's job.\nLast month, Platini was questioned by Swiss investigators about a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) he received from FIFA in 2011 for work carried out up to 2002.\nBlatter is being investigated as a suspect in the case, while Platini is being treated \"between a witness and an accused person,\" according to the Swiss.\n___\nFollow Rob Harris at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
