Baker scored untouched on runs of 79 and 45 yards and then hauled in a 25-yard pass from Anu Solomon to break a 24-all tie in the fourth quarter.\nThat play capped a 94-yard drive and followed a 97-yard drive sparked by backup QB Jerrard Randall.\nSolomon, who as ineffective for the Wildcats (5-2, 2-2 Pac-12) over the second and third quarters, re-entered the game and found Baker wide open with 9:17 remaining for his third TD.\nRandall ran 11 times for 81 yards and scored from a yard out with 4:40 left to make it 38-24, which proved the difference when Sefo Liufau found Shay Fields over the middle for a 30-yard touchdown to bring the Buffs (3-4, 0-3) within seven with 2:19 remaining.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:30:58.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
