The in-form striker fired home the only goal midway through the second half as the Shrimpers claimed a fifth win in six matches. Vale had earlier gone close to scoring with Uche Ikpeazu having a goalbound effort blocked by Southend skipper John White before Enoch Andoh's deflected effort was pushed to safety by goalkeeper Daniel Bentley. In reply, the on-loan Pigott saw a 12-yard shot deflected onto the right post before strike-partner Myles Weston wasted a great chance to score when he fired wide of the left upright when clean through on goal. At the start of the second half, Andoh saw a rasping effort palmed away by Bentley before Colin Daniel fired wide of the left post from 20 yards. But, after surviving the scares, Southend replied to break the deadlock in the 63rd minute when Anthony Wordsworth's low, left-wing cross was bundled into the back of the net from close range by Pigott.
