Huh | The Associated Press Healthy Numbers: Lind enjoys bounce-back season in Milwaukee \nMilwaukee Brewers first baseman Adam Lind, right, scores on a single by Khris Davis as Chicago Cubs catcher Miguel Montero looks to the field during the seventh inning Sept. 23, 2015, in Chicago. Posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 6:45 am Healthy Numbers: Lind enjoys bounce-back season in Milwaukee By George Bremer | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 12, 2015 by George Bremer \nANDERSON — Most of the doubt has been removed for Adam Lind this offseason. \nAfter changing organizations — and leagues — for the first time in his eight-plus seasons in the majors, the former Highland star has found a happy place. \nLind proved a lot of things to a lot of people with a bounce-back season — batting .277 with 20 homers and 87 RBIs at age 32 — and even surprised himself. Playing first base for the first time on an everyday basis, he set a goal of playing in 130 games. He appeared in 149, his highest total since 2010 and the third-highest of his career. \n\"At this point in my career, that's probably the most important thing,\" Lind said during a recent cell phone conversation from his home near Tampa, Fla. \"There's a lot of value for management in having players you know can go out there every day.\" \nRecurring issues with his back limited Lind to 96 games in 2014 and likely hastened his exit in Toronto. The Blue Jays picked up the second of three option years in his contract last November then promptly traded him to Milwaukee. \nThe uncertainty leading up to that decision caused some angst for Lind. And once the deal was made, he wasn't sure what to expect. \nHe'd been with Toronto since being drafted in the third round out of South Alabama in 2004, his wife is a native of the city and he'd be playing in the National League for the first time. That meant playing primarily without the DH, a position he's filled for 395 games and 1,598 at-bats. \nBut he found the senior circuit agreed with him. Lind played first base for 134 games and got 553 of his 572 plate appearances while playing that position. \n\"I love playing first every day,\" he said. \"The season went by considerably faster than when I was a DH.\" \nThat's saying a lot considering the troubles the Brewers suffered through as a team. Milwaukee finished 68-94, good for fourth place in the NL Central, 32 games behind division champion St. Louis and 29 games out of a playoff spot. \nThe team got off to a slow start, then found a bit of groove in May and June. During that time, Lind said he would have put the Brewers' 1 through 6 hitters up against most other teams' in the National League. \nBut July brought a rash of trades as Milwaukee loaded up on prospects for the future. Among those sent packing were third baseman Aramis Ramirez, outfielders Carlos Gomez and Gerardo Parra and pitchers Mike Fiers and Jonathan Broxton. \nLind's name also was bandied about in trade talks, but nothing ever came together. \nInstead of a swap to a contender that could have led to his first postseason appearance, Lind watched from afar as his old team won the AL East and snapped a 22-year playoff drought. \nBut he holds no ill feelings. \n\"I'm definitely rooting for those guys,\" Lind said of the Blue Jays, who entered play today one loss from elimination against the Texas Rangers. \"I think it's a great experience. I wish I could be a part of it. They're an exciting team to watch, by far the best hitting team in the league.\" \nLind enjoyed a different set of experiences in Milwaukee. For the first time, he found himself playing with teammates 10 years his junior and took on something of a mentorship role. \n\"We still had fun,\" he said. \"The guys on the team have talent. They're just really inexperienced and really young.\" \nLind has little idea what's in store for him next. \nThe Brewers have until three days after the end of the World Series to make a decision on his final option year. If they pick it up, they could look to deal him over the winter or next summer. If not, he'll become a free agent for the first time. \nA year ago, both of those options might have caused him a bit of stress. But now he's been through the trading process, and he's experienced an organizational change. He has no fear of switching addresses again. \nHe also has no problem remaining in Milwaukee. He was impressed by the fan base that turned out even at the end of the season, and he enjoyed his first season in Wisconsin. \n\"Other than the win-loss column, it's a great place to play,\" Lind said. \"It's a first-class organization. Everything about it was great.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:23:59.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
