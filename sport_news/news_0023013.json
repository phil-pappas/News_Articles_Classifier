Lincoln senior Ryan Thomas savored his final — albeit somewhat frustrating — round of varsity golf at the Lincoln Elks Club Monday. Thomas chalked up a 94 and individually finished 37th in the IHSA Class 2A Lincoln Sectional Tournament. “I definitely could’ve done better,” said Thomas, who managed four pars. “I played well, but I just didn’t find the hole” Still, he got to wrap up his high school golf career on Lincoln’s home course. “It was pretty nice,” Thomas said. “I wish I shot a little better, but it was a fun time.” Thomas came out of nowhere at the end of the season. He suddenly hit his stride in the Springfield Regional at Lincoln Greens on Tuesday. There, he shot an 83. He was the only Railer to advance to the next round. Thomas previously shot a 103 on the same course in the Central State Eight Conference Meet on Oct. 1. “It was a pretty rough year,” Thomas said. “But I somehow turned it around when it mattered. I didn’t let anything get in my head. I just went out there for the fun of it.” He was also a little shocked himself. “I was glad to represent this high school,” Thomas said of the sectional. “It’s still hitting me that I’m a senior, but I’ll be all right. It was fun.” Lincoln coach Chris Ciaccio always knew Thomas had the potential. “I always thought he had the ability to shoot in the mid-80s,” Ciaccio said. “I was really proud of him for sticking it out. He was frustrated for most of the year. He played well at regionals and I thought today he struck the ball as well as he’s had all season. “It’s too bad we don’t have another couple of weeks because he would’ve been in the low-80s and high-70s.” Several Railers barely missed the cut at regionals: Jack White, Isaac Lewis and Zach Morris. Although White graduates, the rest bode well for the future. “Since the start of the season, we’ve come a long ways,” Ciaccio said. “That’s all you can really ask. We have some young guys coming up next year and I’m looking forward to it.” By Bill Welt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:27:39.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
