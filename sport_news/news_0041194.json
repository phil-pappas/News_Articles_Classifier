Reynaldo Pineda, 35, of the 2000 block of W. Algonquin Road, is charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault and home invasion. In setting bail, Cook County Judge Jill Cerone Marisie said Pineda \"represents a substantial danger to the community\" and is \"a possible flight risk.\" Prosecutors say Pineda broke a window screen and opened the sliding door to the woman's home about 2 a.m. Sept. 25, 2014. Cook County assistant state's attorney David Shin said Pineda made his way to the bedroom and sexually assaulted the woman numerous times. Shin said Pineda spoke of \"money\" and the woman \"replied she would give him whatever amount he desired.\" After her assailant fled, the woman called police, who found the missing window screen and her empty jewelry box in a nearby yard. On Wednesday, Arlington Heights officers learned fingerprints from the window screen matched those of Pineda, who had been arrested on charges of a misdemeanor traffic offense, Shin said. After his arrest, said Shin, Pineda made statements to police implicating himself in the assault. He also told officers he sexually assaulted a woman in Mexico and a homeless woman in Arlington Heights that was never reported, Shin said. If convicted of the class X felonies, Pineda faces up to 30 years in prison. He next appears in court on Nov. 12.
