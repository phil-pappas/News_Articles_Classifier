Devils will rely on youth to offset departures 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Albany\nThis isn't like college athletics, where schools have some handle on which players will return.\nFrom one year to the next, a minor-league hockey team isn't sure what its lineup will look like until the season opens, which for the Albany Devils will be Saturday night in Binghamton.\nOnly 13 of the 28 players on last year's opening-night roster are back as the Devils, following the lead of their NHL partner in New Jersey, try to infuse youth into their ranks.\n\"We've been young on the back end, and now we have this influx of young forwards,\" said Rick Kowalsky , beginning his sixth season as Albany's head coach. \"It's no secret we've been one of the older teams in the league at the NHL level.\"\nMore Information\n2015-16 Albany Devils season-opening roster\nNO.

That incorporates 46 percent of the goals scored by the A-Devils.\nLast year's opening roster had 1,531 cumulative games of NHL experience. That figure has dropped 55 percent, to 682 games, among the current players, although the amount of cumulative American Hockey League experience is up 10 percent (from 3,469 games to 3,830).\nLeft wing Joe Whitney , the team's leading scorer each of the past four seasons, heads the list of departures. He signed a free-agent contract with the New York Islanders and is now on the AHL roster in Bridgeport.\n\"He's been our leading scorer and the major part of our offense coming into each season,\" Kowalsky said. \"The biggest thing, I don't think we can look for one guy (to replace Whitney).\"\nHere's a position-by-position look at how the Devils, who have missed the American Hockey League playoffs in 13 of the past 15 seasons, hope to reverse that trend:\nForwards\nSix of the 15 forwards on the roster are age 22 or younger, led by Joseph Blandisi , a 21-year-old who led the Ontario Hockey League last season with 52 goals and inherited Whitney's jersey No. 9. Two of the youngsters, Graham Black and Matt Lorito, are out indefinitely because of injuries.\n\"Young guys coming in, if they want to make a mark in this league and a mark in their careers, this is where it starts,\" said veteran center Rod Pelley . \"It's fresh, it's exciting for these young guys coming in. For the guys that we have returning, they're established players, you expect them to continue on the way they've been playing.\"\nPaul Thompson , second in the AHL last season with 33 goals, gives Albany at least one sniper.\nThe offense should be boosted with the additions of Jim O'Brien , who won a Calder Cup with Binghamton two years ago, and Corey Tropp , assigned to Albany on Thursday on loan from Rockford of the AHL.\nDefensemen\nSix of the eight who began last season in Albany have returned. Aside from Czech rookie Vojtech Mozik , who will miss the first couple of weeks because of a knee injury, the other seven average 206 games of AHL experience.\n\"The big addition is (Marc-Andre) Gragnani,\" Kowalsky said. \"He's a veteran guy that's played in the NHL, played in the American League, power-play guy. He can be a leader back there for us, a puck mover, but also defends well.\"\nThe return of Seth Helgeson , who was the final cut by New Jersey, also adds depth on the defense corps.\nGoaltending\nBecause of injury, there are four goalies currently in residence with Albany.\nScott Wedgewood , expected to be the starter, sprained his ankle this week in practice and is out indefinitely. Yann Danis , a veteran signed for insurance, is battling back spasms, although he will get the start in Binghamton if healthy.\nKen Appleby is a 6-foot-5, 215-pound rookie who has impressed the Devils in workouts. Once Wedgewood and Danis are 100 percent, Appleby could see time at Adirondack of the ECHL, which has a working agreement with Albany.\nDoug Carr , who played 13 games for Adirondack's AHL team last season, was signed this week as insurance.\n\"There's been a clear-cut concept organizationally that we're trying to get younger,\" Kowlasky said. \"It's been talked about in training camp, and guys are going to get chances to play here.\"\npdougherty@timesunion.com • 518-454-5416 • @Pete_Dougherty", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/73/8761066/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/73/8761066/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:58:09.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
