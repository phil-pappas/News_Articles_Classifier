VICTOR — The beginning of October brought cold weather, big hits and a 21-7 victory for the Victor football team over Rush-Henrietta on Friday. The Blue Devils hosted the Royal Comets on homecoming. After receiving the first half kickoff, Rush-Henrietta drove down the field with some big runs from senior running back Gavin Mcdonald. After a first and goal from the 4-yard line, the Royal Comets committed a penalty and then couldn’t get the ball into the end zone on three attempts. “That was big for us, they drove it right down the field to start,” Victor coach Geoff Mandile said. “We were able to get a sack and then stop them on fourth down, it was huge.” Victor’s first possession took five minutes and ended with a Jamie Trimboli 10-yard touchdown run to put the Blue Devils up 7-0. The Royal Comets answered with 8:57 left in the first half on a Jared Gerbino rushing touchdown. Gerbino came into the game with a banged up ankle, but was able to manage over 30 yards on the ground. On Victor’s next drive, Pat Barrow ran the ball into the end zone to give the Blue Devils a 14-7 lead. With time running down in the first half, Victor had another chance to score, but a personal foul penalty kept the Victor offense from scoring. The first half was full of penalties and some chippy plays from both sides. “We preach it all season long,” Mandile said. “We want the kids to stay away from the altercations. Emotions run high, both sides were hyped, but they controlled it well.” Victor received to start the second half and wasted no time adding to its lead. Dan Barrow scored from the 1-yard line to put the Blue Devils up 21-7. Both defenses clamped down in the fourth quarter and the Blue Devils were able to run the ball and keep possession away from RH to hold on to the win. “We wanted to control the clock against a dynamic offense like theirs,” Mandile said. “I think they ran 10 plays in the second half, it was a perfect formula for us.” Dan Barrow, Pat Barrow and Trimboli all ran for a touchdown and Trimboli completed one pass on the day. Tight end Zac Lefebvre had one reception for about 15 yards. Rush-Henrietta’s Joseph Ortiz had an interception and Gerbino scored the lone touchdown of the game for the Royal Comet offense. With the win, Victor improves to 5-0 and the loss drops Rush-Henrietta to 3-2. Games like this will certainly help the Blue Devils prepare for the last couple of games of the regular season and the Section V playoffs. “When this game came out on the schedule, I emailed their coach and we were both excited,” Mandile said. “We knew we were both going to be pretty good teams in Monroe County and now we have another big one next week.” The Blue Devils will travel to Hilton on Friday and the Royal Comets will host Webster Schroeder a week from Saturday.
