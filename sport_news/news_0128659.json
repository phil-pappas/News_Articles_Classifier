Minooka beat Plainfield Central on Tuesday night in Minooka. By KAITLYN JASNICA kjasnica @shawmedia.com \nMINOOKA – The Minooka girls volleyball team needed to beat Plainfield Central on Tuesday to get back in the Southwest Prairie Conference title race. Related Links Minooka picks up win over Joliet West \nNot only did the Indians accomplish that feat, they beat SPC rival Central 27-25, 25-22 in front of a huge senior night crowd. \nThursday’s games will determine if the SPC crown goes to Plainfield Central or Central and Minooka, but regardless of the outcome, the Indians have many reasons to be happy. \n“It feels really good and it’s definitely reassuring that we have a chance at sharing the conference title with Central,” senior outside Ginger Perinar said. “I think that they played really well and that we were competitive the entire time. Obviously, the crowd made it that much more special. I think that it was a really good way for us seniors to have our last game to remember. \n“No matter how it would’ve ended, we would’ve been satisfied and ready for playoffs.” \nThe Indians dominated despite finding out middle Rocky Perinar couldn’t play only two hours before the match. \nMinooka was shaky to start off with the strange lineup, but it adapted quickly and played strong across the board. \nSophomore Taylor Baranski led the defense with six digs, while senior right side Sydney Arlis had four digs and senior libero Maddie Alessio tallied three. \nBecause the back row passed in system consistently toward the end of the match and never gave up on a ball defensively, the strong offense Minooka boasts was able to shine. \nWith the Indians trailing 13-10 in Game 1, Ginger Perinar wisely tipped the ball over the block for a should-be kill. Central setter Ashley Shook (18 assists, two aces) dove and sent the ball over. \nSetter Brooklyn Bachmann gave the ball back to Perinar, who bounced the ball off Claire Hotchkin’s shoulder. The ball went back over. Senior middle Emily Hise then ran a slide and bounced the ball cross court. \nSimply put, if you give Minooka (20-9, 11-2) enough chances to slam the ball in your face, it will. \nGinger Perinar led with 11 kills, while sophomore outside Allie Papesh had seven and Hise had four. \nThree other players – Holly Bonde (two), Baranski (two), Kamryn Johnson (one) – registered at least one kill. \nThat hot offense is only possible with the consistent first contact, however. \nAfter playing well against the Oswego teams and at its own tournament, Minooka coach Carrie Prosek is confident the team will carry the strong passing and defense into postseason. \nIt also helps to know that when needed, she has a bench that is fully capable of helping out the team. \n“Our ball control has been much better, and since the beginning of the year it has been our focus,” Prosek said. “We beat Joliet West this weekend and it was all ball control. What was nice tonight was that we didn’t have Rocky, but I’ve said all season that we have players that can come in and step up. We’re progressing just the way I wanted them to this season.” \nThe long-term goal was doing well come postseason and doing well in conference. \nAnd it all comes down to the two teams that stepped on Minooka’s court Tuesday. \nFor the Indians to share the SPC title with Central, they will have to beat Romeoville and the Wildcats would have to lose to Plainfield East on Thursday. \nThe two also most likely will face off in the regional championship match and are even at one win a piece in the season series. \nEven though Plainfield Central might intimidate some players, the matchup excites Minooka. \n“Last time, it was us that was up, 17-9, and they came back and beat us,” Prosek said. “It can go either way if we meet up with them in postseason which I’m assuming we will.” \n“If it ended up being both of us, it would be an awesome game just to play in,” Perinar said. “I love to play this team. Some teams get nervous, but I think that it’s so much fun and it’s better than playing a less successful team. You know it could be so much pressure, but when you play to have fun, it’s so much more enjoyable.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:59:18.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
