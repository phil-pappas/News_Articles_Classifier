(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) (Elsa) Comments \nNEW YORK â€” Yoenis Cespedes attended the Mets ' mandatory workout at Citi Field on Saturday but refrained from participating in baseball activities in order to give his ailing shoulder more time to heal. \n\"Compared to the first day when the pain started, I feel a lot better,\" Cespedes said. \"I could probably do something today, but I don't want to do anything. I don't want to push myself. I want to give myself another day before I really start doing stuff again.\" \nWhen asked if he thinks he'll be ready in time for Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday, Cespedes said, \"Yeah.\" \n\"I don't think it's going to limit me,\" he added. \"Honestly if I didn't feel 100 percent, I would not have a problem just stepping down and saying that I can't play. But I think I'll be ready.\" \nPLUS : Matt Harvey will start Game 1 of World Series \nCespedes left Game 4 of the National League Championship Series with a left shoulder injury and received a cortisone shot on Thursday. He said he believes he sustained the injury while doing pushups in Chicago. \n\"I can't be 100 percent sure, but what I can say is that I've never liked doing pushups,\" Cespedes said. \"Those two days over there, I was doing pushups because I didn't have a gym I could do other workouts in.\" \nSince the Mets will play Game 1 on the road at Kansas City, they'd have the option of using Cespedes as their designated hitter if he still isn't feeling 100 percent. However, Cespedes said he doesn't enjoy being the DH because he doesn't feel as engaged with the game. \n\"Even if I'm not feeling 100 percent out there, I'd still want to play,\" Cespedes said. \"I don't like being the designated hitter. I don't feel like I'm part of the game.\" \nMaria Guardado may be reached at mguardado@njadvancemedia.com . Follow her on Twitter @mi_guardado .
