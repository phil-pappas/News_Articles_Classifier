In other words, the model is purely objective and ignores outside factors like personnel, coaching and motivation.\nThe professor and the gambling-sharp focus on four statistics to evaluate offenses and defenses—rushing, passing, scoring and how effectively the ball is advanced relative to down and distance. The data is adjusted for home field and game situation, and weighted by predictive ability. (For more information on their methodology, visit massey-peabody.com.)\nThe number by which teams are ranked represents how each team would fare if it played a hypothetical league-average team on a neutral field. Therefore, you can calculate the model’s predicted score for any game by calculating the difference in the power ranking and adding 2.5 points for the home team.\nHere are the model’s best bets for this weekend’s action, based on difference with the actual Las Vegas point spread.\nBIG PLAYS\nENLARGE Quarterback Marcus Mariota of the Tennessee Titans passes against the Indianapolis Colts.

The Bills are reeling after getting beaten handily by the Giants last week in Buffalo. They shot themselves in the foot with penalties that have gotten a lot of attention but also missed tackles and blew coverages. Can they tighten things up against the Titans, led by a rookie QB in Marcus Mariota who most years would have been live bait for a Rex Ryan defense. But Mariota doesn’t seem like the typical rookie quarterback (110.3 passer rating) and has had an extra week to prepare for this game. The Bills quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, will need to overcome the likely loss of multiple top weapons, including his two top running backs.\nChicago Bears at Kansas City Chiefs, 1 p.m. ET, Sunday\nVegas: Chiefs by 9; M/P Line: Chiefs by 6.3\nThe Bears are the pick. Kansas City is struggling so badly on both sides of the ball that it’s shocking that they are such heavy favorites against any team and especially a Chicago team that actually won last week and that has Jay Cutler in again at quarterback. Massey-Peabody believe that wins are merely descriptive and not predictive but you still expect some tax. Alex Smith doesn’t like to throw the ball downfield, making it very tough for the Chiefs to cover a line this big. Couple that with a porous Kansas City secondary that has allowed 11 passing TDs already.\nENLARGE Jay Cutler of the Chicago Bears looks to pass against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 2.

The Ravens are also very thin, especially on offense where quarterback Joe Flacco has no experienced receivers left after Steve Smith broke his ribs last week. This is likely to be a low-scoring game but the oddsmakers seem to be overreacting by installing Baltimore as too low a favorite.\nNew Orleans Saints at Philadelphia Eagles, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\nENLARGE Wide receiver Willie Snead of the New Orleans Saints runs with football after a reception against the Arizona Cardinals. Photo: Getty Images Vegas: Eagles by 4.5; M/P Line: Eagles by 2.0\nRemember when Drew Brees was written off as being washed up last week before posting such a big day against the Cowboys—even with a weak shoulder—that he was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week? That is a thing that happened. And the Eagles last week could not stop Kirk Cousins with a chance to even their record and instead allowed a winning TD pass in the final seconds to fall to 1-3. The Saints have a horrible pass defense but can Sam Bradford and his unaccomplished receivers take advantage? Philadelphia decided this offseason to buck the trend and throw a lot of money at running backs and now, shocker, there is dissension in the ranks with the highest paid one of all, DeMarco Murray, wanting more carries despite gaining only 47 yards on his 29 attempts.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR737_SNEAD0_P_20151009110846.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR737_SNEAD0_M_20151009110846.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR741_MARIOT_P_20151009111521.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR740_CUTLER_M_20151009111307.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR741_MARIOT_M_20151009111521.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR740_CUTLER_P_20151009111307.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:00:51.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
