The take on Utley’s takeout New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada, goes over the top of Los Angeles Dodgers’ Chase Utley who broke up a double play during the seventh inning in Game 2 of baseball’s National League Division Series, Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015 in ... more > By MIKE FITZPATRICK -   \nNEW YORK (AP) - This much is certain: Anyone who bemoans that baseball’s gone soft never covered second base with Chase Utley bearing down on a potential double play. \nWhat’s not so clear is whether Utley’s takeout slide Saturday night, the one that broke the right leg of New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada and created all this postseason clatter, was a dirty play. \n“It’s hard baseball, man,” said closer Kenley Jansen, Utley’s teammate on the Los Angeles Dodgers. “The game has started to become too sensitive.” \nOf course, that’s not how the seething Mets viewed it after Tejada was carted off in an air cast. \n“Before he could get the ball out of the glove, he’s getting tackled,” infielder Kelly Johnson said. \n“Slide would be generous,” snarled an irritated Daniel Murphy. \nNo matter where your allegiance might lie, it was a flash-point play - ruled legal by umpires - that immediately dropped jaws and grabbed attention for several reasons. \nFirst, runners rarely go in that hard at second base these days, although Utley long ago earned a notable reputation for it. \nSecond, it led to a serious injury. \nAnd third, it was the turning point in a playoff game that millions were watching. \nSo there’s no doubt, Utley flipping Tejada at Dodger Stadium will become this generation’s reference point for famous takeout slides - a flashback to a bygone era when middle infielders were wiped out with such force more frequently. \nThink of Pete Rose barreling into Bud Harrelson, sparking a brawl between the Reds and Mets in the 1973 NL Championship Series. Or Hal McRae upending Willie Randolph during the 1977 Royals-Yankees ALCS. \nAnd this one had all the qualities of a sports injury that won’t soon be forgotten - like Rose running over Ray Fosse at home plate, or Lawrence Taylor snapping Joe Theismann’s leg on “Monday Night Football.” \nSo the debate raged on, with current and former players from all around the majors weighing in on social media and television. \n“I hate the fact that people keep saying he plays the game hard. Everybody on the field plays the game hard,” said ESPN analyst Alex Cora, a middle infielder during his playing days. “There’s a way you should play the game, and this is not the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:22:52.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
