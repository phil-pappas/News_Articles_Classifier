Tough match in general. But I think I played well,\" Nadal said.\n\"I played much closer to the baseline than the previous days. That's very important for me, very important for my game. The position for me on the court today was more aggressive, and that's why I was able to beat him today after a couple of defeats.\"\nNadal, 29, last won a hard court title 21 months ago in Qatar. He has won three times this year on clay and grass and is set to book a place at the end of season ATP Finals in London next month.\n(Writing by Patrick Johnston in Singapore; editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:29:59.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
