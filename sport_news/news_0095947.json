(Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images) \nLet’s get this out of the way first: Apparently, there’s still a place in the toy market for Nazi soldier dolls. That’s already bizarre, but it’s not the weirdest part of the story for Germany’s soccer captain Bastian Schweinsteiger. See, the Nazi doll, manufactured by a Chinese toy maker, looks exactly like him. Outrage in Germany as Chinese toy manufacturer produces Nazi doll called 'Bastian' that looks like Schweinsteiger… pic.twitter.com/CCm4yWkBIg \n— BreatheSport (@BreatheSport) October 22, 2015 \nThe doll, which depicts a Wehrmacht soldier near exactly down to the Nazi insignia on his hat, is even called “Bastian.” Schweinsteiger is suing a Chinese company for producing a Nazi figurine that bears an uncanny resemblance to him. pic.twitter.com/zynmjaycJF \n— 90thMin ⚽️ (@90thMin) October 22, 2015 \nNeedless to say, Schweinsteiger is reportedly not really keen on this. According to Germany’s Bild newspaper, the Manchester United midfielder has decided to sue the company, despite that the Hong-Kong based manufacturer has claimed any likeness to the 31-year-old soccer star was wholly unintentional. \n“We offer no figures based on the football [sic]. The resemblance is purely coincidental,” DID toy makers spokesman Patrick Chan said (via the Telegraph ). “The figure is based on a typical German. We believe most Germans look like this. Bastian is a common name in Germany.” \nSchweinsteiger, who was instrumental in German’s 2014 World Cup win, has not commented publicly on the matter. \n(H/t: Deadspin ) Marissa Payne writes for The Early Lead, a fast-breaking sports blog, where she focuses on what she calls the “cultural anthropological” side of sports, aka “mostly the fun stuff.” She is also an avid WWE fan. sports Success!
