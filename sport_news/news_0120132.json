But when a guy who has been part of history speaks, youngsters take note. Amol Muzumdar, the former Mumbai skipper, who was a special invitee to the Mumbai dressing room on Thursday morning, was supposed to address the young Mumbai boys for half an hour. But the former skipper's passion for Mumbai cricket and its rich history, made him extend his speech for an hour. And none of the Mumbai boys complained. In fact, they were all ears to the old warhorse.\nSample this: Shreyas Iyer, who scored a whirlwind double century against Punjab in Mumbai's winning outing in the last game, admitted he can't be a part of lectures. \"But Amol sir spoke so well that I didn't realise it was more than an hour since he began speaking,\" Iyer told TOI.\n\"He spoke about Mumbai's history. And for a guy like me who is obviously not connected with the past, it was something to look forward to. All I know is that Mumbai are 40-time Ranji Trophy champions. I had no clue what went into making those champions. So for me it was an amazing experience,\" Iyer added. Mumbai skipper Aditya Tare , who has been around for a while, and is as passionate about Mumbai doing well, was equally fascinated. \"It was an amazing experience. I was very upset when we conceded the first innings lead against Andhra Pradesh. We did some brainstorming after that match (he considers it a defeat). And when someone like Amol comes and addresses us and talks about the past, the way our seniors have performed and fought, it is an experience which cannot be described. It can only be felt,\" he stressed.\nMumbai's second innings hero (he took six wickets to help Mumbai down Punjab), Akhil Herwadkar, is only 20. He was candid enough to admit that he is not too aware about Mumbai cricket's history, but was delighted to listen to Amol. \"I had no clue our past generation played cricket with so much passion and intensity. And when you get to know about what they did in the past and how they conquered opponents, it is simply breathtaking. I immensely enjoyed listening to Amol sir. It made me feel like jumping into the park and taking on the opposition at that very moment.\"\nMumbai take on Tamil Nadu on Wednesday and hopefully Muzumdar's pep talk will inspire the hosts against last year's runners-up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:58:57.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
