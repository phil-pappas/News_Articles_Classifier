He initially hurt himself sliding into second base. Beltre stayed in the game for another inning and hit an RBI single, but could barely get to first base.\nHere is video of Beltre struggling to get down the line:\nYour browser does not support iframes. \nBoy, that's rough. Beltre is one of the toughest players in baseball, so he must have been in a ton of pain to come out of a postseason game. Beltre reportedly received a cortisone shot during the game, but it didn't help enough. He had to leave Game 1 and did not play in Game 2.\nSaturday is an off-day for the ALDS, and the Rangers are holding a workout at Globe Life Park in Arlington. Beltre is not with the team and is instead resting, as everyone hopes he'll be ready to go for Game 3.\nRangers Adrian Beltre excused from workout today. Will rest and take medication for next 24 hours.\nâ€” Anthony Andro (@aandro) October 10, 2015 Utility infielder Hanser Alberto has replaced Beltre at third base. Alberto had the go-ahead RBI single in the 14th inning of Game 2, though he's also made several poor defensive plays, plays we've seen Beltre make countless times over the years.\nThe Rangers can replace Beltre on their ALDS roster; however, that would make him ineligible for the ALCS roster. He could return in the World Series, should they advance that far. The team believes Beltre will be able to play again this series.\nEven without Beltre, the Rangers were able to win both Game 1 and Game 2 in Rogers Centre. They lead the best-of-five series two games to none. Game 3 will be played Sunday. Martin Perez and Marco Estrada is the pitching matchup.\n\nAdrian Beltre left Game 1 of the ALDS with a back injury.
