(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nWith the Lions mired in a 0-4 start, wide receiver Golden Tate said it’d be selfish to complain about how many targets he’s received so far.\nTate has 29 targets so far this year, which put him on pace for 116 for the season, and has turned them into 18 catches for 190 yards. Last year, he had 142 targets and finished with 99 catches for 1,331 yards. Although he didn’t want to complain, he still said that he’s been open on plays when the ball doesn’t go his way.\n“I try to run the plays the coaches design, and at the end of the day, we all watch the same film,” Tate said Friday. “If I’m open to me, I’m usually open to someone else watching the film. So, I just try to keep putting myself in positions to win, and hopefully people see that I’m open and just give me a chance. That’s the only thing I can do.”\nTate said it’s not his style to “go on a rampage” or embarrass his teammates or coaches over targets, and when asked if he thinks he’s been getting open, he provided one universal truth about players at his position.\n“I’m a receiver, man. I’m always going to feel like I’m open,” he said. “You could have three dudes on me.”\nThe best way to see if Tate has been open is the coaches tape from NFL Game Rewind. A look at his 33 routes on Monday — he played 47 of 56 plays — shows that there were some times he came open against the Seattle Seahawks, but the ball didn’t go his way for a variety of reasons.\nOn a few of the plays where Tate was open, quarterback Matthew Stafford had already thrown the ball before the top of Tate's route. On some, Stafford was under pressure before he could throw to Tate, and on a few others, the quarterback was looking elsewhere. The Lions had nice gains on a couple of the plays where Tate was open, too.\nThe problem, of course, is the Lions rank 30th in total offense, so they have to take advantage any time their top players, like Tate, are open.\n“I’m not even frustrated about the looks, man,” said Tate, who went to the playoffs in four of his first five seasons with the Seahawks and Lions. “I’m frustrated about the winning, about not winning. I’ve been there in Seattle where I have two passes but we won, so I think that’s selfish to complain about the passes.\n“But when you’re losing, I feel like I could’ve done a little bit more, I feel like I could’ve done something better or I could’ve spoke up a little bit more during the game to get some looks so that’s where my frustration comes is just when we lose and I’m unproductive.”\nAgainst his former team Monday, Tate had just three catches for 29 yards — on four targets — and a 6-yard run.\nOne play where Tate was clearly open came with 55 seconds left in the second quarter. The play netted a 13-yard gain on a short pass to running back Theo Riddick, but Tate would’ve gained at least as much if he’d caught the pass.\nLate in the second quarter, Golden Tate (circled in red) comes free against the Seahawks zone on a play that resulted in a 13-yard reception by Theo Riddick.

Tate was open on the final offensive play, too, a 10-yard gain to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who fumbled at the 1.\nOn the second play of the second quarter, Tate waved his hand after finding space on a crossing route, but Stafford threw the ball away after spinning away from a defender. Later in the second quarter, Tate had inside position on cornerback Richard Sherman on a post route, but Stafford had already zeroed in on tight end Eric Ebron, who gained 3 yards on the play.\nWith 33 seconds left in the second quarter, the defensive back on Tate blitzed, and he was open on an outside-breaking route in front of a safety when Stafford instead threw to Johnson.\nThe only target Tate didn’t catch was a deep throw into double coverage on a third-and-14 in the third quarter. On his biggest gain, a 22-yarder on the final drive, he was covered well.\n“He’s always open even when he’s not and you love that in a guy,” offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said. “He’ll get his touches; it’ll come around for him.”\nAnother issue with the Lions deployment of Tate is their offense rarely produces when he’s off the field. On the nine snaps where he was on the sideline, the Lions averaged 4.6 yards per play, but 17 of those 41 yards came on a pass to Lance Moore. The other eight plays averaged 3 yards. The Lions averaged 4.8 yards on their 53 official plays — three snaps were nullified by penalty.\nOn the Lions’ second drive of the game, they gained 12 yards on a pass to running back Ameer Abdullah before removing Tate for three consecutive plays and punting.\n“I just try to stay quiet during game, keep doing my job and hopefully at some point, I get my opportunity to help win,” Tate said.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:19:17.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
