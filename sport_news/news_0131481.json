Jets goaltender Ondrej Pavelec made a number of key saves in the first as the Islanders had four power-play chances. \nRyan Strome banged in a rebound with a man advantage at 19:48 of the first, giving the Brooklyn matinee crowd a chance to launch their standard “Yes! Yes! Yes!” chant. Tavares and Kyle Okposo assisted on Strome’s first of the season. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:04:50.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
