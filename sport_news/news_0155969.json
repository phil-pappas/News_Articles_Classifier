(Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) Comments \nJonathan Wallace and Jonathan Jones saw it with their own eyes – the infighting, the distractions, the losing, the despised curfew program and the quitting. \nOf Auburn's 18 seniors, not including the recently dismissed D'haquille Williams , only nine – including Jones and Wallace – were part of the 2012 team that went 3-9 amid a season of chaos and dismay resulting in the firing of then-coach Gene Chizik and his staff less than two years following the 2010 BCS National Championship. \nJones and Wallace don't think this season, in which Auburn (3-2, 0-2 SEC) was among the favorites to win the SEC Championship and contend for a spot in the College Football Playoff but has already fallen from the polls, had multiple distractions due in large part to Williams , questions of defensive effort against LSU and struggles at quarterback is a repeat of 2012. \nRELATED: Auburn offense 'prepared' to throw if need be Auburn defensive back Jonathan Jones: Oct. 6, 2015 Auburn defensive back Jonathan Jones (3) talks to the press Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2015, after practice in Auburn, Ala. (Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) \n\"The biggest difference I would say is chemistry,\" said Jones, who has 26 tackles and four pass breakups this season. \"You can just feel it in practice. In 2012 I could sense people were giving up. No one's lost faith; no one's lost hope here. Everyone's fighting. \n\"Practice is still live and everyone's are jumping around and excited. Any time you have energy, that's the main point. People want to bring energy to practice and come out and play.\" \nAuburn ranks last in the SEC in points allowed and rush defense , leading defensive coordinator Will Muschamp to ask who would bother to pass against the Tigers . However, Muschamp, hired last December on a three-year, $5.1 million contract, has been \"very pleased\" with how the players have responded in practice this week. \n\"Absolutely, yeah,\" Muschamp said. \"The work we've had (Tuesday and Wednesday has) been outstanding.\" \nHowever, as was the case in 2012, there are questions of leadership on this year's squad. \nAuburn coach Gus Malzahn always relies on seniors to lead the team and Jones and Wallace, the offensive captain, feel leadership is better now than it was three years ago, but none of them could cite a specific player among the 18 seniors who is taking charge. \nIt was similar in 2012, when Wallace, Kiehl Frazier and Clint Moseley were rotating at quarterback. The late Philip Lutzenkirchen was the voice of the offense, though he was injured for the second half of the season and T'Sharvan Bell was a vocal leader on a woeful defense. \n\"The difference on this team is we actually have some leaders that step up, and not just say something but actually do something to help police this team around,\" Wallace said. \"A coach can only do so much. Coach Malzahn has made it a point that this is our team. We have to do whatever it takes to reach our goals and aspirations playing this game. We're willing to do whatever it takes to make sure this team gets back to winning football.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:16:07.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
