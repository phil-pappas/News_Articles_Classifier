We knew we needed to come out here and stop the run game, and I thought we did a good job of that.” \nThe Chargers’ problems started early. The offense drove inside the 5-yard line of Harlingen High, but a fumble gave the ball to the Cardinals. Harlingen High turned it into a 34-yard field goal by Jose Martinez-Lugo in the first quarter. \nDuring the second quarter, Harlingen High took control. Tienda scored on an 8-yard run, and a few minutes later Jesse Castro had a 14-yard touchdown run as the Cardinals were suddenly up 16-0 midway through the quarter. \nOn the Chargers ensuing drive, Marcus Castillo threw an interception and the Cardinals took advantage. Tienda scored on a 7-yard run for a 23-0 lead. \n“It’s little things that we did wrong, and when you do little things wrong they add up and they become big things,” Brownsville Veterans coach David Cantu said. “Ultimately, that’s what happened. All those things that went wrong were caused by a good Harlingen (High) Cardinals football team, so kudos to them.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
