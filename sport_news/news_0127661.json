Related Content While correspondent Albert Breer interviewed Adam \"Pacman\" Jones following Cincinnati's 34-21 road victory over the Buffalo Bills, several of Jones' teammates could be seen undressing in the background of the live shot . The camera captured the naked buttocks of several Bengals players and at least some brief full frontal nudity. Meanwhile, the NFL GameDay Live anchors back in the studio could be heard stifling laughter. After the interview was over, one of the anchors can be heard saying, \"Wowie zowie, what an interview\" with another adding, \"Yeah, that was interesting,\" before again breaking out in laughter. \nBreer himself also took the incident in stride, later retweeting one fan's comment with an embarrassed emoji.
