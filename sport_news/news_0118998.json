He had a 12-6 record at USC, including 3-2 this season. \nAfter Sarkisian was placed on indefinite leave, there were multiple reports detailing his misuse of alcohol, including allegations that he was drinking to intoxication for the Arizona State game two weeks ago. \nHaden, who said he vetted Sarkisian during his coaching search in 2013, announced the leave Sunday when he told reporters it was evident Sarkisian was not healthy. \nThe Los Angeles Daily News reported Sunday night that Sarkisian was drunk on the sideline in Tempe, Ariz., when USC beat Arizona State on Sept. 26. Assistant coaches pulled Sarkisian out of a player huddle when it became clear, per the report, he was \"not sober.\" \nIn the same report, players alleged they smelled alcohol on Sarkisian's breath Sunday morning during a team meeting four days after Thursday's loss to Washington. \nPrevious reports by the Seattle Times traced binge drinking during Washington's program outings and recruiting trips, including to Indian Wells resort in 2012, when a tab of more than $1,000 resulted from \"91 tequila shots.\" In the same story, the paper claimed Sarkisian was notorious for making early drinking stops during recruiting trips. \nWhen Sarkisian agreed to seek treatment in August after he was clearly drunk during USC's \"Salute to Troy\" event, he told media during his first interview that he didn't have a problem or need treatment. Instead, he said he mistakenly drank while taking pain-killing medication. Sarkisian also has been going through a divorce. \nFormer Washington tight end Michael Hartvigson posted via Twitter, \"Coach Sark is still having fun at USC! #ThingsHaven'tChanged.\" \nHaden allowed Sarkisian to remain on the job in August, but based on reports Sunday and Monday, he didn't walk the straight and narrow. \nOn Sunday, Haden was informed at 1 p.m. PT that Sarkisian wasn't at the 12:30 p.m. PT practice. That's when he reached the coach, whose team is struggling after beginning the season in the Top 25 polls. \nMeanwhile, former USC coach Pete Carroll said Monday he has reached out to his former assistant. \n\"It breaks my heart to see how this has gone,\" Carroll, now the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, told 710 ESPN Seattle. \"But he recognizes it and he's going to do something about it, so this is the day the turn occurs. \n\"I'm grateful for everybody around him that he's finally figured it out. ... This is going to take a long time. This is big battle and we'll pull for him all the way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:17:45.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
