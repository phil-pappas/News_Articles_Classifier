The attacker was also wounded.\nIt was not clear if the attacks were coordinated.\nThe Jerusalem attacks came after a Palestinian stabbed and wounded a passerby north of Tel Aviv before being overcome by civilians in the area.\nPolice described the attacker as a 22-year-old Palestinian from the occupied east Jerusalem and said he was taken to hospital with serious injuries after being beaten by residents.\nAfter first breaking out with attacks and violent protests in the occupied east Jerusalem and the West Bank, unrest has also spread to the Gaza Strip, with clashes along the border in recent days leaving nine Palestinians dead from Israeli fire.\nIn response to the violence, Israel was planning an emergency meeting of its security cabinet.\nPalestinians were meanwhile calling for a \"day of rage\" on Tuesday and Arab Israelis were planning a general strike in support of them.\nFunerals of Palestinians killed during unrest or while allegedly carrying out attacks -- as well as videos of the shootings -- have fed anger.\nPalestine Liberation Organisation secretary general Saeb Erekat said Tuesday new petitions would be sent to the International Criminal Court against Israel, accusing it of \"extrajudicial executions\".\nMore than 20 stabbing attacks have occurred in Israel, Jerusalem and the West Bank since October 3.\nThere has been one revenge attack, with an Israeli stabbing and wounding two Arab Israelis and two Palestinians in the southern Israeli city of Dimona last week.\nAt least 30 people have died so far in the recent unrest.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Monday that Israel would not bow to \"knife terror\" but Palestinian unrest has shown little sign of slowing.\nThe knife attackers have usually been young Palestinians who appear to be acting on their own.\nFrustrated Palestinian youths have defied president Mahmoud Abbas as well as an Israeli crackdown by staging violent protests in the occupied east Jerusalem and the West Bank.\nOn Monday evening, dozens of Gaza residents broke through the border fence and briefly entered Israel before being pushed back by troops, Palestinian witnesses said.\nMedical officials said two men were injured by army fire.\nThe crisis started in late July when an 18-month old toddler Ali Saad Dawabsha was burned to death and three other Palestinians were severely injured after their house in the occupied West Bank was set on fire by Israeli settlers.\nThe settlers smashed the windows of two homes in the village of Duma near Nablus and threw Molotov cocktails inside the buildings. Dawabsha died after sustaining serious burns as a result of the attack.\nThe parents of the toddler, Riham and Saad, and their other son Ahmad lost their lives after suffering serious injuries as a result of the attack.\nOn October 1, when an alleged Hamas cell shot dead an Israeli settler couple in the West Bank in front of their children.\nIt followed repeated clashes at Jerusalem's flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound in September between Israeli forces and Palestinian youths.\nIsraeli forces have responded to Palestinian protesters with live fire, rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades.\n*This story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:34:19.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
