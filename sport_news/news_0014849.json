(Photo: Doug McSchooler, AP) CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPISCATAWAY This is not the time for Rutgers to spot its opponent a 25-point lead. \nRutgers has notched 25-point comeback victories in two of its last eight games, dating back to when it established a school record during the 2014 regular-season finale against Maryland. \nThe record was tied just last week, when Rutgers scored 28 unanswered points to beat Indiana . \nUnbeaten No. 1 Ohio State is unlikely to blow that sizable of a lead, especially as it looks to build a case as a more dominant team than it was early in the season, when it squeaked past Northern Illinois and Indiana. Rutgers football nearly upset No. 1, national champs Miami in 2002 \nGannett New Jersey will have a team of four college sports writers on hand to cover the game at 8 p.m. at High Point Solutions Stadium. Here are our staff predictions: \nRyan Dunleavy: My hunch is that the injured Leonte Carroo plays, which means Rutgers will score at least 18 points since the star wide receiver catches three touchdowns in every game. I'm only half-kidding. Carroo has caught three touchdowns in three of the four games he has played and has nine in 13 quarters of action this season. Plus, he had 100 yards against Ohio State last season. Still, it takes a lot more than one star player to beat Ohio State, which can beat you with its quarterbacks, its rushing attack or its pass-rush. Ohio State 49, Rutgers 21. \nSteve Edelson: Two weeks after No. 4 Michigan State scored in the final minute to steal a victory at High Point Solutions Stadium, the top-ranked Buckeyes find a way to win at the end. This time it's J.T. Barrett, making his first start for the Buckeyes, throwing a touchdown pass in the final minute, nullifying Chris Laviano's third touchdown pass of the game to Leonte Carroo just minutes earlier. Ohio State 35, Rutgers 31. Why Ronnie James picked Rutgers over Ohio State as a recruit \nJerry Carino: At a glance, this seems like a no-lose proposition for Rutgers: sold-out stadium, ABC audience, No. 1 team in the nation coming to town. What could go wrong? Well, the score could go very, very wrong of the Scarlet Knights don't bring their A-plus game. Even then, this opponent is just too good. The most interesting thing about this contest is how many Buckeye fans get their hands on tickets. The guess here is about 15,000 (between a quarter and a third of the crowd). Final score: Ohio State 41, Rutgers 20. \nJosh Newman: Ohio State is not Indiana. Ohio State 41, Rutgers 20 \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LU19Cc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:03:27.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
