Comment Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 2:18 PM CANTON Canton is trying to bring the NFL draft to the league’s birthplace — officially. David Baker, the president and executive director of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, said Canton submitted an application two weeks ago to the host the draft in either 2019 or 2020. “I can’t guarantee it’s going to happen,” he said of hosting the event. “But we’re gonna fight awful hard for this thing.” Baker was Monday’s guest speaker for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Luncheon Club at Tozzi’s on 12th. Canton has previously expressed interest in hosting the draft, but this is the first time it has applied. The application coincides with the NFL’s 100th season, which is in 2019, and the league centennial, which is Sept. 17, 2020. The bulk of construction for the Hall of Fame Village should be done by then. Chicago, which hosted this year’s draft, will again be the site in 2016. Baker said the league is expected to select the 2017 and 2018 sites in March 2016, then choose the 2019 and 2020 sites in March 2017. Baker also said the Hall of Fame Village’s “Center for Excellence” is scheduled to break ground in March, with the four-star hotel breaking ground in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:29:55.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
