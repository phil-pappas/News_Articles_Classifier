The University of Minnesota Crookston football team has launched a new community service program for the 2015-2016 school year. The program is called “Soaring Eagles.” Coach Shelly Patterson, a volunteer assistant coach for the team, created the program with the players’ input, after meetings she had with many of the players during spring football. The Golden Eagle players expressed to her a desire to do more in, and for, their community, and to create a stronger connection between them and the people of Crookston. After Coach Patterson’s conversations with the players, “Soaring Eagles” is offering two community service programs during this football season. “Golden Eagles Meet Golden Eaglets” is a program offered to Crookston and surrounding area elementary schools during home game weeks. Players will be available to read with the Pre-K-3rd grade students and to participate in recess/physical education class with the 4th-6th grade students. The players’ goal is to help schools promote literacy and physical activity, while having fun with the students and signing autographs for them. The students will also be invited to attend Friday “walk-thru” practices and Saturday home games during home game weeks. “Golden Eagles Meet Golden Years” is being offered to our older residents who still live in their home, and who can use some help with yard work in the fall and clearing snow and ice off driveways and sidewalks in the winter. There is no charge for the players’ assistance. If you are a school administrator or Crookston “Golden Years” resident who would like to utilize the services the UMC Golden Eagles football team is offering through its “Soaring Eagles” program, contact Patterson at coachpspeaks@gmail.com for more information or to schedule UMC players to visit your school or home.
