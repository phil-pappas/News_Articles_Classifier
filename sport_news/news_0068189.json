(Getty Images) By Kyle Kensing \nSeveral installments in the previous 86 meetings between rivals Notre Dame and USC have had high stakes, including Heisman Trophy candidacies and national championship aspirations. \nWhen the two iconic programs meet on Saturday night in Notre Dame Stadium, a lot is on line in terms of the immediate future. But the direction of USC's program beyond the 2015 season also starts with the Trojans' performance against the No. 14 Fighting Irish. \nSteve Sarkisian's dismissal as USC head coach on Monday leaves one of college football's most historically successful programs in search of a leader for the second time in two years. Interim head coach Clay Helton may be a long shot to land the position full-time, but he gets to audition first . There may not be a better first impression for an aspiring USC head coach than to bring the Jeweled Shillelagh back from South Bend. \nHelton has been on the USC staff in various capacities since the 2010 season, so he's intimately familiar with both the program's inner workings, and the players he now leads. He captured the bond between himself and the team when recounting his introduction as interim head coach. \n\"I've been in this profession 21 years. I've probably forgotten a lot of plays, a lot of games,\" Helton said. \"I'll never forget, as long as I live, [USC athletic director] Pat Haden introducing me to this team, and the ovation they gave me.\" \nHe provides consistency, something that's been sorely lacking amid a tumultuous time for USC. \nThey led in the second half of home losses to Stanford and Washington. Porous defense against the Cardinal and anemic offense against the Huskies placed the Trojans in the position they now face at 3-2, desperate for a win to salvage the season. \nHelton finds himself in a position mirroring that of former USC colleague Ed Orgeron two years ago. Orgeron succeeded Lane Kiffin midway through the 2013 season and gained support as a prospective, full-time hire with his 6-2 record. \nLosses in each of USC's two rivalry games, including a 14-10 decision in the Trojans' last trip to South Bend, ultimately soured Orgeron's candidacy. This particular Notre Dame team is better than the 2013 squad that beat USC, and it has certainly outperformed the 2014 Fighting Irish, who lost at USC, 49-14. \nIn much the same vein that Saturday is a pivotal moment for the direction of USC's program, Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly said in his weekly press conference that blowout loss a year ago turned around the Irish. \n\"They knew that's not Notre Dame football, and you don't play that kind of football here at Notre Dame,\" he said. \"We talked about what our standard of play was and is, and that's not our standard of play.\" \nThe standard Notre Dame's set this year has it in pursuit of a College Football Playoff berth. Thanks to a loss at Clemson, reaching the playoff is contingent on the Irish winning out, which obviously starts with beating USC. \nAmong the changes Kelly made during the USC defeat a season ago was replacing turnover-plagued Everett Golson with Malik Zaire at quarterback. The Irish lost Zaire to a leg injury in Week 2, but freshman DeShone Kizer has filled in admirably. \nKizer's job is made easier by the veteran talent around him. Running back C.J Prosise -- filling in for injured starter Tarean Folston -- has gotten Heisman attention, and wide receiver Will Fuller isn't far behind USC's JuJu Smith-Schuster for pass-catching production. \nNotre Dame is now one of the most aggressive defensive teams in college football. Opponents have struggled to throw the ball against the Fighting Irish this season -- a departure from last November, when USC quarterback Cody Kessler set a record for touchdown passes against a Notre Dame defense with six. \nThrough six games, this year's Fighting Irish have surrendered just seven passing touchdowns. \nShould USC opt to rely on the run, it will have to contend with one of the nation's most talented front sevens, particularly All-American linebacker Jaylon Smith. The Notre Dame lineup is star-studded on both sides of the ball, but the only advantage it has over USC is that Kelly and his staff have successfully parlayed talent into production. \nOn the Trojans' side, Helton's job now is unifying his roster to compete week after week. Should he do so, the job could be his beyond the remaining season. USC was made well aware this week when Keyshawn Johnson, one of several past Trojan greats, laid out the scenario. Keyshawn Johnson, &quot;Why don&#39;t we go get Chip Kelly? Enough of that. It&#39;s your opportunity to make (Helton) coach.&quot; pic.twitter.com/0g7pkuTYnQ &mdash; Lindsey Thiry (@LindseyThiry) October 15, 2015 \nA USC win on Saturday is more than a step toward this season's goals. It's the first step in shaping the next few years of the program's identity. \n* * * Kyle Kensing is a contributor to Sports on Earth.
