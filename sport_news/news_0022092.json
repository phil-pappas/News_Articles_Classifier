Coming off a shootout victory over Anaheim last night, Vancouver is making a lineup change, with 19-year old Jake Virtanen set to play in his first NHL game.\n“It is pretty exciting to finally get my first game in here. My family is going to be here for it so it will be pretty cool to have them out here supporting me. I am looking forward to getting out there and getting started.\nThe first round pick impressed in training camp, but found himself in the press box for the first three games of Vancouver’s season. It is still unclear where he will slot in to Coach Willie Desjardins’ lineup, but Virtanen says he will come out throwing the body.\n“I obviously want to get in a couple hits the first couple shifts. I want to feel comfortable out there, get some shots and cycle some pucks down low. I want to play good defensively and that will lead to offence. I just need to keep it simple and play hard.”\nAs for the Kings, they have limped out of the gate, dropping the first two games of their season. Alex Burrows says despite Los Angeles’ early struggles, the Canucks can’t count out their divisional foes.\n“It is always tough to play the Kings in a back-to-back. They are going to be ready for us and have been resting for a few days. We just have to prepare well, refresh, regroup and re-hydrate and we will be ready to go.”\nKings forward Tyler Toffoli says they would love to bust out of the slow start with a win against the Canucks\n“We have been working on our breakouts and finding ways to come out clean. We are confident we can turn things around. It is really early in the season and we know the group we have in here. We are not panicking, we just have to keep working and find a way.”\nThe puck drops at 7:30 p.m. and you can watch it on Sportsnet Vancouver.\nAlex Burrows | Canucks | hockey | Jake Virtanen | Kings | nhl | Sportsnet | vancouver", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:57:55.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
