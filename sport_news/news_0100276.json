Jefferson battled the No. 3 ranked team in Division 2 well, eventually losing 15-25, 24-26. \n“We played them tough for the first time this year, which is a big stride for us,” Fairfield said. \nFrom there the Eagles took on the South Division’s second seed, Brodhead, and came away with a hard-fought 23-25, 27-25, 15-8 victory over the Cardinals. \n“We battled with them and were able to put them away,” Fairfield said. “I think we made some strides with how we played against East Troy, and then being able to take out Brodhead — as a team I think we came out positive, even finishing sixth.” \nIn the fifth-place match, Jefferson took on Evansville. After splitting a pair of five-set decisions with the Blue Devils during the regular season, the Eagles lost in three sets — 8-25, 25-22, 10-15 — to place sixth. \nEvansville and Jefferson will play one another Tuesday in the Division 2 Regional quarterfinals, so Fairfield didn’t want to show his hand and put out a lineup that gave some players who normally don’t get a whole lot of playing time some tournament experience. \n“We had a good lineup on the floor, we just haven’t played that lineup before ... there were girls on the floor getting kills and blocks that normally don’t get those opportunities during the regular conference season,” said Fairfield. \nEast Troy defeated Walworth Big Foot in the championship match, while McFarland, Edgerton and Evansville rounded out the Top 5. \nThe No. 5 seeded Eagles travel to No. 4 Evansville for a 7 p.m. start Tuesday. The winner will play either No. 1 McFarland or No. 6 Marshall in a Regional semifinal Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:22:23.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
