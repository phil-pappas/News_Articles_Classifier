I can fight early next year. I can fight by March,\" he told the Asia Society in New York, whose Asia Game Changer award he is to receive at the United Nations on Tuesday. \nPacquiao, a congressman since 2010, announced this week his bid for a senate seat in national elections to be held in May next year. \nAsked about the possibility of one day running for president, the 36-year-old boxer said, \"Right now, I don't have that in my mind.\" \nUnder Philippine law, presidential candidates must be at least 40. \n\"Becoming a president is not the plan of the man. It's the plan of god. Who knows if he will become a president?\" said the boxer, a born-again Christian. \nPacquiao turned professional when he was 16 years old and has won an unprecedented eight world titles in as many weight divisions.
