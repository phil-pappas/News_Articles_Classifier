Under the plan, all employees who work 20 hours or more a week will be paid at least $13 an hour beginning today. All new and renewing contracts with the university will also require that workers be paid the same minimum wage.\nThe wage will rise to $14 an hour on Oct. 1, 2016, and to $15 on Oct. 1, 2017.\n\"Supporting the employees -- and their families -- who help make UC a leading institution is an important part of our values as a public university,\" Napolitano said.\nThe University of California system is the state's third-largest employer, with about 195,000 employees at its 10 campuses, five medical centers, three national labs, the Office of the President, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources and other locations, according to UC.\nAs part of the wage-hike plan, the UC also plans to expand its monitoring to ensure employees of contract companies are being paid the proper wages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:01:34.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
