The Red Bulls are three points ahead of Los Angeles and four in front of FC Dallas in the race for the overall lead.\nAmbroise Oyongo was shown a red card for a hand ball on what otherwise would certainly have been a goal by Bradley Wright-Phillip in the 15th minute, leaving Montreal (12-13-6) a man down.\nKljestan put away the ensuing penalty kick.\nWright-Phillips slipped behind the defense on a breakaway, pulling goalkeeper Evan Bush out to the top of the box, but couldn't convert either of two shots. The second, however, ricocheted back to Sam, who chipped over a scrambling Bush to make it 2-0 going into the half.\nDidier Drogba converted a penalty kick in the 67th for Montreal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:30:18.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
