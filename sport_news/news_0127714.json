When you play high-stakes football in the Big North United Division, including the self-imposed challenge of top-shelf national competition, nobody wants to talk about moral victories.\nSo what do you make of St. Joseph’s performance Friday night against IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla.?\nThe Green Knights lost to IMG, 24-12. It was their first loss of the season, and they’re still kicking themselves over missed opportunities.\nThe flip side is that St. Joseph more than held its own against a team crammed with prime Division I talent. The defense, the best in North Jersey, held the Ascenders to a season-low in points.\nSo, glass half-full? Glass half-empty?\n\"It’s good and bad,\" St. Joseph coach Augie Hoffmann said Sunday afternoon. \"Watching the tape again made me even more disappointed. You never say you should’ve won a game, but we had opportunities to put ourselves in a position to win.\n\"You screw up against that team and they take advantage. Then there were times when you may be in the right position, but their guy just made a better play than our guy.\"\nBut even Hoffmann acknowledges that this game was a learning experience like no other. The Green Knights faced arguably the top high school quarterback in the nation in Shea Patterson, and he didn’t chew them up and spit them out.\nThey’ll remember that three weeks from now when they face Bergen Catholic’s red-hot quarterback Jarrett Guarantano in a game that could decide the coveted United Division crown. They’ll remember that next month in the Non-Public Group 4 playoffs.\n\"The players absolutely get it,\" said Hoffmann, whose team is No. 1 in The Record Non-Public Top 6. \"They were [angry after Friday’s game] because they felt like they let an opportunity go.\n\"But there were no big doe eyes out there. I saw right away that it was, ‘OK, here we go. We’re ready to rock and roll.’\"\nThe Green Knights aren’t going to see a team as good as IMG the rest of the season, but that doesn’t mean they can take anything for granted. There’s a built-in trap with games like these that can lure a team into a false sense of security if it’s not careful.\n\"You can’t look at other teams as say, ‘Well, the tailback’s not going to Notre Dame. The quarterback’s not going to Ole Miss,’\" Hoffmann said. \"You can’t look at it that way,\"\nThe Green Knights still have two more out-of-state games on tap, but Hoffmann knows where the real challenge lies.\n\"At the end of the day, it’s still going to be all about Bergen Catholic and Paramus Catholic and the Big North United,\" Hoffmann said. \"And I’m sure we’re going to see Don Bosco again.\"\nEmail: czerwinski@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:44:11.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
