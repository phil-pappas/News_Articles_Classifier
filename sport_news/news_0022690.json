He moved to Chelsea from Manchester City for a massive £21 million, making him the most expensive teenager at the time. In the three years he spent at Chelsea he made 81 appearances. He took a while to break into the first team but when he did he was there to stay, maintaining it under Jose Mourinho and Avram Grant. In 2008 he started the League cup final, which Chelsea lost to Tottenham, but failed to make the squad for the Champions League Final against Manchester United. That same year Wright-Phillips re-joined Manchester City for a fee believed to be around £8.5 million.
