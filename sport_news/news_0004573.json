It was big for us.\" \nLast January, when Harrington and the Cardinals returned to team activities, the energy that shone through against McNeese State was still present. \nPlayers were buzzing about their program's progress - there was talk about being yearly contenders in the Southland Conference and winning a conference championship sooner rather than later. \nSenior wide receiver Reggie Begelton , entering his fifth and final season, was one of those players who noticed a different attitude. \n\"That win over McNeese really opened our eyes,\" Begelton said. \"Our confidence went way up, and momentum started rolling. That's what us winning that game did.\" \nEven when Lamar was picked eighth this season in the Southland preseason poll, Begelton and the Cardinals didn't flinch. \nAt Southland Conference media day in July, Begelton answered question after question about the polls, reinforcing that the Cardinals were the team that knocked off McNeese State, not the team people saw from 2010-2013. \nDiscounting last week's slip-up against Northwestern State, the Cardinals have exhibited all of the signs of the team that showed up at McNeese State. \nLamar hung tough against Baylor, ranked No. 2 in the Football Bowl Subdivision, then beat Sam Houston State, at the time No. 3 in the Football Championship Subdivision, for the first time and narrowly lost to two-time defending Southland Conference champion Southeastern Louisiana on the road. \n\"Our expectations entering this season were higher,\" Cardinals head coach Ray Woodard said. \"We finally figured out the difference between wanting to win big games and actually winning big games because of McNeese.\" \nEven former players, like wide receiver Mark Roberts , have noticed Lamar's change in attitude. \nRoberts' last college game was the victory over McNeese State. \n\"I saw it on my way out and I've seen it this year,\" Roberts said. \"The guys are playing with a different swagger now. They're playing like they can't use the excuse of 'Oh, we're a new program' anymore.\" \nLamar's 2-2 conference record is good for a fourth-place tie. With Central Arkansas and McNeese State, two teams leading the Cardinals, among their last five opponents, there's time for improvement. \nWoodard isn't worried about his team's psyche. As a coach, that's all he can ask for. \n\"I'm not sure how these last five games will go,\" Woodard said. \"But what I do know is that these guys won't give up. They're a fun group to coach, more mature than they've been in the past and have put us on the right track.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:30:59.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
