One of them is to go 1–0 every week, which makes it a pillar crafted from unalloyed coach-speak but a pillar nonetheless. The long-range goals set by the Cougars’ first-year head coach extend only so far as the American Athletic Conference championship game: Herman’s team will set out every year to win the league, and that is that.\nBut what about after that? The pursuit of the Group of Five bid to the New Year’s Six bowl games? Or the creeping possibility that one of these American Athletic Conference teams might nudge their way into the College Football Playoff?\n“We don’t talk much about it,” Herman said in a phone interview this week. “It would be hard for me to fathom through six or seven weeks, wherever we’re at. It’s so early, and all the things that need to go right seem so far down the road. It won’t be near as unfathomable in three or four weeks if we still have one or two of us left standing with no losses.”\nCollege Football Video 2015 Midseason Crystal Ball: Picks for the playoff, Heisman and much more by SI Staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:25:24.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
