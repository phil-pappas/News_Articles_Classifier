They are Ajmer Singh Aulakh, Dr Atamjit Singh, Gurbachan Bhullar and Canada-based Waryam Sandhu. Dr Atamjit has also returned Rs1 lakh to the academy, besides telling the authorities not to translate his books. In a letter written to the Chairman of the Akademi, Dr Atamjit told him not to send him the royalty of his books. Speaking to The Tribune, Aulakh, a popular dramatist in the rural Punjab, said there was an attack on the freedom of thought. Certain progressive writers, who were popular in literary circles and were known for rationalist and progressive thinking, had been killed in the recent past. Aulakh said violent assault on the freedom of thought was unacceptable. He said he had returned the award to protest such tendencies and forces which were moving about freely without any fear of the law. Intellectuals such as Prof MM Kulburgi had been killed. Earlier, a rationalist and a left leader were shot dead, he said. Aulakh said India was a secular country and no one had the right to impose his views and way of life on others. Efforts were being made to impose one’s thought on the people of the country. People belonging to a particular religion had been targeted. He referred to the murder of Ikhlaq in Bisara in UP. He said such events were a black spot on the secular face of the country. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on such matters was shocking. “The Prime Minister should speak against such elements who are spreading hatred in the country and have become a threat to the peace,” Aulakh said. In a letter written to the Chairman of the Sahitya Akademi, Dr Atamjit has said: “Whatever is happening in the country is painful. It is not the first time that parochial ideologies and narrowness of certain groups have come out to challenge the pluralistic fibre of this country, the foundation of which was laid by saints like Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Teg Bahadur by sacrificing their lives. We have seen the Congress government of the time playing havoc in Delhi and other major cities of India after the assassination of Indira Gandhi. We know, for sure, that there were elements within the ruling party that supported the violence and shamelessly continued to shield the culprits. “It certainly is the first time when a large section of establishment, by keeping mum or issuing politically correct statements, seems to be justifying the violence against the minorities and the intellectuals whose ideas are not in tune with them. I am not here to support the sayings of slain writer Kalburgi, but I am certainly bothered that in a democratic country like ours a writer of national recognition can be killed for his ideas and the chairperson of the Akademi requires permission of his organisation to openly come out and aggressively condemn such incidents. But the Academy is content with a customary condolence resolution,” he writes in his letter. “You think that the writers are politicising the issue by returning their awards. I am not sure. It could be true in some cases. If you are politicising the situation by keeping quiet, they are doing so at least by their deeds,” Dr Atamjit has written. Megh Raj Mittar, a rationalist and writer, has also returned the Shiromani award in protest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:17:27.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
