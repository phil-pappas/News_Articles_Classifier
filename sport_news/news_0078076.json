Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more to help No. 14 Oklahoma State beat Kansas 58-10 on Saturday, hours after a fatal crash near the stadium put a harrowing halt on the school's homecoming festivities.\nFour people were killed and dozens injured when a woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed a car into a crowd at the homecoming parade. Oklahoma State considered postponing the game, but in the end, opted to go ahead with it.\nThe flag at Boone Pickens Stadium was lowered to half-staff and Cowboys players knelt down on the field and prayed before the coin flip.\nEven as the game began, some of the bodies remained at the scene of the crash less than three blocks away from the stadium. National Guard troops kept watch as officials with the Red Cross and state medical examiner's office continued their work.\n___\nALABAMA SCARE\nDerrick Henry and Alabama only dominated the last few minutes, when their national championship hopes were hanging by a thread.\nIt was just enough. Henry scored on a 14-yard run with 2:24 left and the eighth-ranked Crimson Tide held on for a 19-14 victory over Tennessee with an overpowering finish in a game that was precariously close.\nHenry was barely touched on his second touchdown of the game, though the 2-point pass from Jake Coker failed. Then it was the defense's turn.\nAlabama recorded two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the win.\nThe Tide got plenty of help, with Tennessee missing three long field goal attempts.\n___\nNUMBERS\n10_Years since Kansas State last lost four straight games.\n20_Straight home wins by No. 2 Baylor, best in the FBS.\n58_Points Miami lost by against No. 6 Clemson, the worst loss in the Hurricanes' 90-year history.\n75_Career rushing touchdowns by Navy's Keenan Reynolds, two short of the NCAA record set by Wisconsin's Montee Ball from 2009-2012.\n608_Career completions by Penn State's Christian Hackenberg, breaking Zach Mills' school record. Hackenberg also became the Nittany Lions' career passing leader with 7,453 yards, also passing Mills.\n___\nRAZORBACKS GO LONG\nTime and again in three seasons under coach Bret Bielema, Arkansas has struggled in the fourth quarter and overtime.\nThe Razorbacks saved their most dramatic win for their longest one yet under Bielema, holding on in the end for a thrilling 54-46 win over Auburn in quadruple overtime.\nIt was a back-and-forth game full of lead changes and big plays, the last of which was Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen's 25-yard touchdown pass to Drew Morgan on the opening play of the fourth extra period.\nFollowing a 2-point conversion pass by Allen to Jeremy Sprinkle, the Razorbacks defense finally found a way to stop the Tigers when it mattered most — earning Bielema his first win over former Arkansas offensive coordinator and Auburn coach Gus Malzahn in three games.\nIt was longest game for Arkansas since a triple-overtime win over Kentucky in 2003.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
