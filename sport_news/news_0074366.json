(John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Shannon Ryan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Illini forward Leron Black on injury: \"Everything happens for a reason.\" \nDuring Illinois' overseas tour this summer, Leron Black posted three double-doubles and finished the exhibition schedule with a 21-point, 15-rebound performance that indicated big things to come this season. \nThat will have to wait. \nThe sophomore forward will miss four to six weeks with a torn meniscus in his right knee, coach John Groce revealed Thursday at the team's media day. Black will undergo surgery Friday. \n\"I'm just trying to rehab and get back as soon as possible,\" Black said. \"I know everything happens for a reason.\" \nHe's the latest Illinois player sidelined by an injury. \nPoint guard Tracy Abrams is out for a second straight season with a torn Achilles. Freshman guard Jalen Coleman-Lands hopes to return by Nov. 1 from a stress fracture in his lower left leg, Groce said. Junior guard Jaylon Tate will miss some preseason practice time because of a concussion. \nGroce said Black likely has been dealing with the knee injury \"for a while.\" \n\"He is one tough cookie,\" Groce said. \"A lot of guys may not have that pain threshold. Fortunately for us it will be a pretty quick deal. We're looking forward to his comeback.\" \nBlack averaged five points and 4.3 rebounds as a freshman in less than 15 minutes per game. He showed progress during the season and notched 15 points and 13 rebounds against Purdue in his first start in late January. \nWith center Nnanna Egwu having graduated, Black was expected to be a major contributor in the frontcourt. For now junior Maverick Morgan, redshirt freshman Michael Finke and graduate transfer Mike Thorne Jr. will try to fill the frontcourt void. \nIllinois, which opens its season Nov. 13 against North Florida, is determined not to let the injury-prone offseason cast a negative shadow on the final month of preparation. \n\"The only thing we can do is wish for their speedy recovery and work with what we've got,\" junior Malcolm Hill said. \"The key is not to hang our heads and stay positive.\" \nThe Illini are eager to bounce back from a disappointing end to last season, when they lost five of their last seven to miss out on an NCAA tournament bid. \nInjuries or not, players are looking for different results. \n\"The guys returning and the transfers as well, they know the position we were in,\" junior guard Kendrick Nunn said. \"We were in the NIT the previous (two) years and we're motivated by that to get to the (NCAA) tournament.\" \nBollant moving forward: After seven former players filed a lawsuit alleging mistreatment and racial discrimination by coaches, Illinois women's coach Matt Bollant said he has taken steps to provide a more positive environment. \nThe university and former assistant coach Mike Divilbiss parted ways after the allegations surfaced in the spring. \n\"I said this (team) needs to be a reflection of me,\" Bollant said Thursday. \"It's going to be my voice. I'm really optimistic. We're going to lead as I would lead. Great teams hold each other accountable. The way you do that is to be upbeat and positive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:26:08.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
