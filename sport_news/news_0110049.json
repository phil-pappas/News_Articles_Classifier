(WGEM) - \nThe QND football team plans to prepare for their game against Quincy High just like any other, however, there is definitely a different feeling to this one.\"For every single one of us on this team, it's the biggest game we've ever played,\" said Senior Linebacker and Running Back Austin Tappe.Friday, when the two schools meet for the first time in 30 years, QND's defense, which only allows an average of 280 yards per game, will be tasked with stopping a Blue Devils offense that averages more than 300 yards on the ground. \"It is what it is. Ever team we've faced has weaknesses and strengths,\" said Head Coach Bill Connell \"Certainly Quincy High's speed is going to be tough to defend.\"A win for the Raiders could also mean a home playoff game at 10th and Jackson. \"People might not really realize until your a senior but it means a lot to have the last home game,\" said Tappe.\"I think winning Friday's game would make a big difference because we would be 7-2 at that point. I think that would help us get a bid to play at home,\" said Senior Running Back Ben Nord.When it comes time for kickoff at Flinn Stadium, the Raiders will be ready to revive an old rivalry and make it a new one. \"It's a big deal,\" said Senior Lineman Mitch Carey. \"I think people have hyped it up a lot. We know what to expect but I think people are really excited for what's to come on Friday night.\" Friday's game will be broadcast live on WGEM-NBC beginning at 7:00pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:27:50.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
