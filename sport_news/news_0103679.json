Most of us who follow professional sports like to think we’re experts in the field. So if you’re a sports fanatic and were watching “Jeopardy!” on Friday night, there’s a good chance your eyes lit up when you saw the “Final Jeopardy” answer was about baseball.\nAdChoices But solving the sports-themed riddle proved a little harder than imagined, at least for the contestants. Here’s the clue :\nMust sheepishly admit that I couldn't come up with tonight's baseball themed Final @Jeopardy question.

Contestants on “Jeopardy!” always seem to struggle with sports questions, but we can’t blame them here, as this one is really tricky.\nSo what was it?\nThe Los Angeles Angels, of course.\n“Los Angeles” translates from Spanish to English as “The Angels,” thus making the team’s full name “The Angels Angels.”\nIf you were stumped, don’t feel bad. We couldn’t figure it out either.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jeopardy", "https://twitter.com/SI_BenReiter/status/655164672350531584", "http://t.co/zVKPcRqrAU", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:26:23.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
