This is being seen as major step towards achieving rapprochement among top Sikh religious institutions. SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar, who yesterday claimed that Panj Pyaras’ suspension would stay, said today’s decision aimed at developing consensus on panthic issues. It is being conjectured that the revocation of Panj Pyaras’ suspension has also paved the way for the cancellation of the suspension of two secretaries and four other officials of the SGPC. On Panj Pyaras’ directive against the five jathedars, he said it was for the SGPC to take a call on the issue. Major Singh, one of the Panj Pyaras, said he had not yet received any information as regards the revocation of his suspension. However, he said, their stand on the jathedars’ issue was intact. He ruled out any possibility of revising it. It all began with Akal Takht pardoning Dera Sacha Sauda chief over 2007 blasphemy. After protests, Makkar reversed the decision. The Panj Pyaras later summoned the jathedars to elaborate on pardoning of the dera chief. Makkar then suspended the Panj Pyaras.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:43.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
