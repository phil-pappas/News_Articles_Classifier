With the Bills dead in the water in the second half, Taylor was the one making the clutch plays , sacrificing his body and willing the team to a 3-2 record.\nLet's just make sure we don't forget the role the defense played in the win. Remember the defense? That defense Rex Ryan and Bills players said would be the best in the league? The one most fans and outsiders have been quick to criticize after a slow statistical start? Well, that defense played as big a role as Taylor in the Bills walking away from Nashville with an unlikely win.\nWhile Taylor made memorable and decisive plays, the defense kept the Bills in the game while the offense failed to complete a pass for a quarter-and-a-half. Consider this: The Bills' offense mustered only 209 yards, and the Titans had the ball for 11 minutes longer than the Bills on Sunday.\nNormally that's not a formula for winning football games, but that's the benefit of having a dominant defense. And yes, this Bills group has shown plenty of signs in the first five weeks that it can be that type of defense.\n\"We can be dominant,\" linebacker Nigel Bradham said. \"We have an opportunity to be dominant. We have the playmakers and we have the scheme. All we need to do is just follow the plan, play together as a defense and we can be dominant each game.\"\nSunday was one of those performances for Buffalo. The Bills' defense held Marcus Mariota to 187 yards passing and one interception. They held the Titans under 100 yards on the ground, and when a play needed to be made at the end of the game, it was star defensive tackle Marcell Dareus busting through the line to force Mariota into a decisive interception to Stephon Gilmore.\nYes, the defensive is an expensive, and the Bills talked the group up more than enough in the offseason. While that warped expectations, it doesn't change the fact that this group is responsible for two of the team's three wins, and that's not even counting arguably their best performance against the helpless Dolphins.\n\"We know at the end of the day (the offense) is going to pick us up sometimes, we're going to pick them up sometimes,\" defensive tackle Kyle Williams said in the visitor's locker room at Nissan Stadium. \"It's a team effort, and it was today. When we had to have a play, they were able to go down and make the play, put us ahead, and from that point we knew we had the opportunity to close the game on defense.\"\nUsually, all the Bills' offense will have to do is give the defense an opportunity to close the game. The defense will usually do it, too. Other than the 500-yard, 40-point performance from the Patriots that has been a black eye for the Bills' defense, Buffalo has played consistently well on that side of the ball.\nIs the Bills' defense the best in the league? Maybe not. They're certainly not as good as Rex Ryan and some players thought they could be in the preseason, at least not yet. Still, while they have worked through some penalty and communication issues early in the season, this defense has helped a beat up offense string together three wins.\nComplain if you want, but the Bills' defense shouldn't be a source of frustration. In fact, it's still the reason to have hope in the Bills being a playoff team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:01:00.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
