Rockford’s Tanner Kero took advantage of a bad bounce in the Iowa zone, scoring with 4:51 left in regulation and breaking a 2-2 tie. Kero led the Icehogs with two goals and one assist. Rockford goalie Michael Leighton (2-2-0) made 16 saves as the 'Hogs snapped a three-game losing skid. Despite making 36 saves on 39 shots, Iowa goalie Jeremy Smith (0-3-1) remains winless this season. Wild forward Christoph Bertschy and defenseman Maxime Fortunus each scored in the loss. After a scoreless first period, the IceHogs claimed a 1-0 lead at 2:03 of the middle frame. Brandon Mashinter poked a rebound past Smith for his first goal of the season. The power-play goal was assisted by defenseman Ville Pokka and Tanner Kero. Iowa countered at 5:28 with a power-play goal by Bertschy. Defenseman Gustav Olofsson held the puck in at the right point before sending a cross-ice pass to Mike Reilly. The Iowa defenseman ripped a shot to the Rockford net that Bertschy tipped past Leighton for his second goal of the season and a 1-1 score. The IceHogs regained the lead at 14:29 as Kero beat Smith with a wrist shot from the left-wing circle. Kero’s fourth of the year squeezed between the pads of Smith for the 2-1 Rockford lead. Forward Jeremy Morin had the lone assist as Rockford carried a 2-1 lead into the second intermission. Iowa tied the score 2-2 with 5:50 remaining in the third period. Fortunus blasted a shot from the slot, scoring his goal with the Wild. Rockford managed to move back in front at 15:09 of the final frame with a second tally of the night by Kero, with an errant bounce off the end boards in the Wild zone. The puck hopped over the stick of Smith, who came out of his crease to play it. Kero picked up the loose puck and scored before Smith could get back into position, making it a 3-2 decision.
