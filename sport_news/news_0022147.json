They know how to play football.” \nIndian captain Sunil Chhetri recalled the tight contest in the June 11 face-off, saying, “We had put up a good performance against Oman at home. I am sure the boys will take confidence from that game. \n“No doubt, we were playing at home and now we are playing away. It is a different game altogether when you play away as we have lost two away games. We will try our best to garner points tomorrow. We definitely want to change the trend.” \nThe Indians lost a day of training due to their late arrival from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan owing to a flight delay caused by bad weather. \nIndia lost 1-2 at Ashbagat, but Chhetri sounded upbeat on Monday, saying, “We aim to keep all the negatives away and hope to put up a good fight.” \nConstantine said that despite the team not having a single point in the group stage so far, ‘motivation is not a problem ever for the players’. \n“Playing for the national team is a big motivation for the players. The desire of representing your country is always there,” he said. \nThe India coach said that the delay in arrival in Muscat was not the best way to prepare for a World Cup qualifier. “But it is what it is and we have to move on,” he said. \nThe Englishman, who is going through a second spell as India coach, said, “Oman has some very good players and over the years they have produced consistent results. \n“The draw against Iran was no surprise for me. We have respect for Oman, but we are here to play and we will fight. We didn’t come here to lose. We don’t go anywhere to lose.” \n‘Qualification to Asian Cup is still possible’ Constantine said that though India is realistically not in the race for a World Cup berth, the joint qualifiers offer a chance to bag a spot in the prestigious Asian Cup. \n“The group stage was always a two-horse race between Iran and Oman for the World Cup, but we will try to qualify for the Asian Cup and we can advance if we win our games against Guam [on November 12] and Turkmenistan at home [on March 29, 2016],” he said. \nBuilding a team for the future Constantine said that he is building a team for the future and the fact that he has tried out 16 new players underlines that strategy. \n“Over the past seven games, I have had 16 new players. We are in the early stages and it is important to give chances to fresh blood,” said Constantine. “It’s understandable that people want instant success, but you can't have that. It will take time.” Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:26:14.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
