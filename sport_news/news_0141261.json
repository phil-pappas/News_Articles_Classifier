(AP) - Michael White threw for 223 yards and Mike Maccarone kicked a 28-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter to earn Marist a 13-10 Pioneer League win over Campbell Saturday. \nMaccarone opened the scoring with the first of his two 28-yard field goals, but the Camels scored at the end of the first quarter on a 4-yard run by Kameron Bryant that made it 7-3. \nMarist (2-4, 1-2) took the lead to start the second half, picking off a Bryant pass and returning it to midfield and needed just three plays to get into the end zone, with Marcellus Calhoun punching in from the 1 for the score to make it 10-7. \nCampbell’s Mitchell Brown’s 37-yard field goal tied the game at 10-10 at the start of the fourth quarter. \nBryant was 17 of 29 for 157 yards to lead Campbell (3-3, 1-2), but was intercepted three times. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:07:34.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
