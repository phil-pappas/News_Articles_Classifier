Sydor's attorney, Ryan Pacyga, says Sydor will serve the first installment over two weekends, starting Friday.\nIf the judge determines Sydor is complying with probation, the future jail time can be waived.\nSydor was jailed on drunken-driving charges in August after authorities said he became lost trying to take his 12-year-old son to a hockey tournament.\nIn a statement, Sydor apologized and said he was \"deeply saddened and humbled\" by his actions. The Wild say they'll address his return to the team later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:30:26.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
