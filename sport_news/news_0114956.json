In February this year the ban was lifted but immediately re-imposed after 20 Zamalek fans died in a stampede at the Cairo Air Defence Stadium.\n\"It's the first time for me to lead games without fans attending,\" Peseiro said.\nThe win is Ahly's second in as many games, following their narrow 1-0 victory over Talae El-Geish in the opening week, as they start the long bid to win the league after losing the title to arch-rivals Zamalek last season.\n\"The Ghazl El-Mahalla game was more difficult than the Talae El-Geish meeting, but Ahly deserved the victory,\" Ahlyâ€™s Portuguese tactician concluded.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:23:59.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
