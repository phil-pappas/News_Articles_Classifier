Damon Severson, who was a healthy scratch in Saturday night’s 5-3 loss in Washington, took Moore’s spot in the lineup.\nMoore took part in the morning skate, but coach John Hynes said, \"He’s not 100 percent ready to play, so we’ll give Damon another opportunity to get back in.\"\nThere was one lineup change up front with Tuomo Ruutu returning after being a healthy scratch Saturday and rookie center Sergey Kalinin being a healthy scratch for the first time this season.\n\"It was more to give Ruutu an opportunity to get back in,\" Hynes said of the decision. \"We think Sergey has come in and played well and has done some good things, but we’re still jockeying around with some of our center positions and wings positions and some combinations that we feel would be able to give us four-line depth and it’s early. That’s why we made the change.\"\nDanis called up \nWith No. 1 goaltender Cory Schneider unavailable following the birth of his son, Wyatt, early Tuesday morning, Keith Kinkaid started in net and the Devils called up veteran Yann Danis on an emergency basis to dress as the backup.\nDanis, 34, made 28 saves in a 4-1 loss in Binghamton in Albany’s 2015-16 opener Saturday. Scott Wedgewood missed Albany’s game with an ankle sprain, so Danis really was the Devils’ only option for a goaltender call-up. Ken Appleby, 20, just signed with the organization Oct. 4 and has no professional experience.\nIn addition, the Devils assigned left wing Reid Boucher to Albany. Boucher, 22, was a healthy scratch Saturday in Washington after playing in Friday’s 3-1, season-opening loss to Winnipeg. He was not scheduled to play Tuesday before he was sent down.\n— Tom Gulitti", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:16:36.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
