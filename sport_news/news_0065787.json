Communal frenzy was being created, innocents were being killed on rumours and intellectuals targeted in the NDA its rule which was threatening the country’s democratic and social fabric, she said. Sonia addressed two rallies at Buxar and Manjhi in Chhapra for the Bihar Assembly elections. Listing Congress’ achievements over its 60-year rule in the country, she urged people to vote for the grand alliance so that a stable government was formed in the state. Speaking at Buxar, she took on the PM over his repeated attacks on the nearly six-decade-long Congress rule, retorting that her party zealously strengthened democracy, which allowed Modi to become the Prime Minister. “The BJP government is moving away from democratic ideals. It is creating a serious threat to democracy by imposing its ideology on the people. Communal tension is being created. “Innocents are being killed in the aftermath of rumours. Intellectuals are being attacked. They are being denied freedom to express their views. It is trying to weaken the foundation of social harmony. It is not just sad but also shameful,” she said in reference to the Dadri lynching incident and the targeting of intellectuals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:14:40.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
