It’s a power ranking, of sorts. This list, however, is not suggesting that, for instance, the George Washington women would defeat the American University men. It’s to recognize teams that have performed at a high level heading into the last stretch of the regular season. \nThe NCAA tournaments will begin Nov. 13 (women) and Nov. 19 (men) and culminate with the College Cups on Dec. 4-6 in Cary, N.C. (women) and Dec. 11-13 in Kansas City, Kan. (men). (UVA) \nRecord: 13-1-1 overall, 7-1-0 in the ACC. \nLast week’s ranking: 1. \nThis week’s schedule: at North Carolina State on Wednesday, at Pittsburgh on Saturday. \nRanked second for weeks, the Cavaliers are expected to ascend to No. 1 in the NSCAA poll after defeating top-ranked Florida State, 1-0, on Sunday in Charlottesville. Alexis Shaffer converted a penalty kick in the 30th minute after Seminoles defender Kirsten Crowley was red-carded for a controversial handball on the goal line. (The ball appeared to strike her body.) The result helped avenge three defeats to FSU last year, including the College Cup final. \n“If the referee got it right, then credit to him, he made the right choice,” Seminoles Coach Mark Krikorian said. “If he got it wrong, then he ruined a good game. It’s as simple as that.” \n2. Georgetown men \nRecord: 10-2-2 overall, 6-0-0 in the Big East. \nLast week’s ranking: 2. \nThis week’s schedule: Seton Hall on Wednesday, at Villanova on Saturday. \nThe Hoyas roared to their eighth consecutive victory, 11th result without a defeat and sixth straight clean sheet by winning at St. John’s 1-0, on Brandon Allen’s penalty kick in the 59th minute. The shutout streak set a program record while the unbeaten run tied one. \n“I told the guys there was not a whole lot to complain about in how they performed,” Coach Brian Wiese said. “They generated a lot of good chances and minimized threats. The only thing I could have asked for from the guys is a little bit more finishing” with a 20-5 advantage in shots. \n3. Virginia men \nRecord: 9-3-2 overall, 4-2-1 in the ACC. \nLast week’s ranking: 4. \nThis week’s schedule: North Carolina on Friday. \nFreshman Derrick Etienne scored in the 12th minute as the visiting Cavaliers defeated Virginia Tech, 1-0, extending their in-state supremacy against the Hokies to 11 matches (8-0-3). Virginia clinched a first-round bye and quarterfinal home game in the ACC tournament. U.S. under-20 goalkeeper Jeff Caldwell posted his fifth shutout of the season. “We were able to manage the game, especially down the stretch, and did a very good job of closing out the game,” UVA Coach George Gelnovatch said. \n4. Maryland men \nRecord: 7-4-4 overall, 2-1-3 in the Big Ten. \nLast week’s ranking: 3. \nThis week’s schedule: at Ohio State on Saturday. \nThe Terrapins showed their inexperience and potential, losing at home to Delaware, 2-1, and defeating nationally ranked Washington, 1-0. In the first match, they conceded the winning goal in the 89th minute, just 65 seconds after equalizing. Three days later, they scored early in the second half on a deflection ruled an own goal against a Huskies team that had registered 10 clean sheets in the previous 13 matches. \n5. Virginia Tech women \nRecord: 14-2-2 overall, 6-2-1 in the ACC. \nLast week’s ranking: 5. \nThis week’s schedule: at Notre Dame on Friday. \nLaila Gray had two goals and an assist as the Hokies defeated Pittsburgh, 4-2, and extended their late-season run to 6-1-1 heading into Friday’s finale. Murielle Tiernan, a junior, netted her 13th goal of the year and program-record 38th of her career. \n6. George Washington women \nRecord: 13-4-0 overall, 8-0-0 in the Atlantic 10. \nLast week’s ranking: 7. \nThis week’s schedule: at Rhode Island on Thursday, Saint Louis on Sunday. \nThe Colonials extended the nation’s longest active winning streak in Division I women’s soccer to 11 with a 1-0 extra-time victory at George Mason. MacKenzie Cowley scored in the 107th minute as GW posted its fifth consecutive clean sheet and 11th overall, breaking the program record set 25 years ago. The last two regular season matches are against teams with losing records in conference play. \n7. Old Dominion men \nRecord: 8-2-2 overall, 3-1-2 in Conference USA. \nLast week’s ranking: 6. \nThis week’s schedule: at South Florida on Tuesday, at South Carolina on Saturday. \nThe Monarchs, fourth in Conference USA, rebounded from last week’s defeat to Florida International with a victory at UNC Wilmington and home draw against nationally ranked Kentucky. \n8. American University men \nRecord: 10-4-2 overall, 3-2-1 in the Patriot League. \nLast week’s ranking: 8. \nThis week’s schedule: Navy on Wednesday, at Holy Cross on Sunday. \nWith a 3-0 victory over Bucknell, the Eagles extended their unbeaten and shutout streaks to five. Joel Hart, Nick Sifrin and Liam Robley scored in a 12-minute span of the second half. AU has a plus-20 goal differential (32-12). \n9. William & Mary women \nRecord: 12-3-2 overall, 6-1-1 in the Colonial Athletic Association. \nLast week’s ranking: 9. \nThis week’s schedule: at Elon on Tuesday. \nA 1-1 draw at James Madison ended the Tribe’s winning streak at six but extended the unbeaten surge to seven with one regular season match left. W&M is second in the CAA, three points behind Hofstra. \n10. Georgetown women \nRecord: 10-5-2 overall, 4-1-2 in the Big East. \nLast week’s ranking: 10. \nThis week’s schedule: Creighton on Friday. \nThe Hoyas, unbeaten in four straight, remain tied with DePaul for second place (behind St. John’s) after a 1-1 draw with the Blue Demons in Chicago. \n11. Radford men \nRecord: 12-2-1 overall, 7-1-0 in the Big South. \nLast week’s ranking: 11. \nThis week’s schedule: at Elon on Wednesday, at Coastal Carolina on Saturday. \nAfter winning at Liberty, the Highlanders trounced Gardner-Webb, 5-0, to improve to 7-0-1 at home. They are tied for third in the nation in scoring with 2.4 goals per match. \n12. Navy women \nRecord: 9-5-4 overall, 3-1-4 in the Patriot League. \nLast week’s ranking: 12. \nThis week’s schedule: Hampton on Tuesday, Boston University on Saturday. \nA 1-0 defeat at Lafayette ended a 10-game unbeaten streak by Navy, which will claim the No. 3 or 4 seed in the league tournament next week.
