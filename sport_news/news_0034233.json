Other states have set that limit at 10 mg. I challenge Oregon authorities to show evidence that a 10 mg dose of THC has caused harm before setting an extreme restriction at 5 mg. The problems that I have seen documented are because people ingest multiple doses far beyond 10 mg. That is the issue that needs to be addressed. It is counterproductive to emphasize a false per-serving limit. Much like the movie \"Reefer Madness,\" demonizing marijuana serving sizes only encourages laughter and mistrust.\nMike Van Orsow\nMilwaukie\nâ€¢\nMarijuana policy: I am troubled to see new layers of fees and regulations being imposed on the emerging cannabis markets. Grower fees, distributor fees and retail license fees on top of the sales tax may defeat the primary benefit of the legal market. The intent of many voters who supported Measure 91 was to separate the large population of cannabis users from the criminal cartels that constitute the current supply chain. The legal market must be safe, convenient, and price-competitive to break the link to the black market where other, more dangerous products are available. Requiring the recreational market to close at 9 p.m. does not seem to solve any real problems. Requiring dispensaries to choose between the medical and recreational markets exclusively will make the retail marketplace needlessly complex. Let's be cautious in our urge to tax and regulate until we have the data and experience to support, by facts, that problems exist requiring intervention.\nDavid Kaplan\nSoutheast Portland", "external_links": ["http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26064835/colorado-regulators-nudge-marijuana-edibles-companies-smaller-doses", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028346", "http://www.portlandoregon.gov/oni/article/547103"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:05:29.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
