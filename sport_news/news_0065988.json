Asked what's to blame – opposing talent, the team's personnel or scheme issues – Whipple said personnel before recessing the matchup problems the Falcons and others have created: \n\"We've played some pretty good players. Will Fuller's really good at Notre Dame and (Roger) Lewis is really good. They've got guys that can run and they spread you out. We didn't tackle very well in the run game and (Travis) Greene's a really good player. We need to get a takeaway. We were six inches short when Randall (Jette) knocked the ball out in the end zone. We're a tackle here, a tackle there away. \n\"And it wasn't anything new. The only wrinkle they gave us, we defended. You can't give up touchdowns on third and 20. We knew it was going to be that kind of game. Nobody's going to slow those guys down.\" \nSo does that mean UMass will make changes defensively moving forward? Whipple didn't seem to think so, especially for this week against a much weaker opponent like Kent State: \n\"This week, we're not going to face a spread offense. I don't think Kent State's going to go four-wide. That's not their deal. Kent State's going to run the ball and play defense. \n\"It's a completely different team. We're playing a different team this week than Colorado, Notre Dame or Bowling Green. (Those teams have) quarterbacks that can really throw it and spread you out. Maybe they'll do that and maybe that'll be their answer. But they haven't had been able to be successful doing that. We don't have to play Bowling Green or any of those teams late this year, so we're not really worried about it.\" \nAnother change Whipple isn't planning on making is on kickoffs, where Blake Lucas booted another pair of kicks out of bounds (his second and third in two games) for penalties: \n\"There were a lot of kickoffs and kickoff returns. I don't think we have to work on those. We had 19 of them in the game. \nNo, no. His leg probably got tired. There were 19 kickoffs. It might be the most I've ever seen. For Bowling Green, it probably only stopped them from getting 75-yard drives instead of 65-yard drives. If we kick it out of bounds, it's 10 yards. I'm more worried about the 71-yard pass or 50-yard pass on third and 20 that goes over the top than that issue.\" \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:21:25.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
