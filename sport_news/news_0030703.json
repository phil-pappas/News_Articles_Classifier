He also went 8 for 9 with 64 yards quarterbacking the offense, as the Blue Devils rolled to a 27-0 victory over Riverside. \nAge: 17 \nFamily members: Father, J.P.; mother, Karen; older sister, Brianna \nOther sports you play: Basketball and baseball \nFavorite sports teams: Washington Redskins, Oregon Ducks for college football and Duke Blue Devils for basketball. \nAthlete you admire: Marcus Mariota. You never hear anything bad about him off the field. He’s a great leader and just his poise as quarterback with his great decisions and everything. \nFavorite food: Crab legs \nThree people you’d like to have dinner with: John Cena, my coach Dan Holland and Marcus Mariota. \nRituals or superstitions: Not really before the game but every Wednesday, me and a bunch of the guys from the team go to Kelly’s for wing night. We go home for like five minutes after practice, shower and shoot right up there. \nSo you had four interceptions. First of all, I’m guessing you never had four interceptions in one game prior to that night? Never. It kind of surprised me because I had four interceptions all of last year and I ended up matching that total in one game. The most I ever had in a game was I think two. It’s definitely a game to remember for the rest of my life. \nThe defense as a whole forced eight turnovers. How important was it to have that type of performance, especially coming off a week in which you gave up 42 points? It was definitely not something you’re used to. Eight turnovers in one game. I know the conditions weren’t the best so that probably resulted in a few of them. But it was huge for us. Our defense is playing all right this year but nothing compared to last year so this game really helped us, especially after last week giving up as many points as we did and not playing our best. It was a huge motivational booster. All week, it was about redemption and beating our rivals. We knew the game against Lake-Lehman wasn’t our best, but it was a lot easier handling that knowing we were playing our rivals and winning that would be the best redemption we could have. So the entire week, the key was effort and motivation. \nPost-graduation plans: I want to play football in college for sure but most of all, I want to worry about the academics because that’s what’s going to be with me for the rest of my life. I want to major in finance. \n\nIn its 66th season, ATHLETE OF THE WEEK appears every Monday in The Times-Tribune. A radio interview with Gutowski will air today at 5:20 p.m. on “In the Zone” with Joby Fawcett on NEPA’s ESPN Radio 630 and 1240 AM and 96.1 and 100.1 FM.
