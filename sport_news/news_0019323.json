TCU RUSH DEFENSE \nMike Warren has certainly been a surprise through the first half of the season, and has ramped up his production every week. He's got 546 yards in the last three games, including 245 — an ISU rookie record — last week. TCU isn't as staunch defensively as it has been in the past, giving up 183 yards on the ground per game. Look for Warren and the improved run blocking to continue growing against a Big 12 title contender. \nAdvantage: Iowa State \nISU PASS OFFENSE VS. TCU PASS DEFENSE \nSam Richardson looked uncomfortable through most of the game at Texas Tech, throwing three picks, but continues to have a good supporting cast around him. Quenton Bundrage had 75 receiving yards on three catches last week while D'Vario Montgomery and Allen Lazard are steady contributors. The Horned Frogs secondary is second best in the league in pass defense efficiency, and their athleticism could continue causing fits for Richardson and his weapons. \nAdvantage: TCU \nTCU RUSH OFFENSE VS. ISU RUSH DEFENSE \nAaron Green is the fourth leading rusher in the Big 12 — 104.2 yards per game — and serves as a counter punch to the air raid offensive scheme of the Horned Frogs. Like Texas Tech, TCU likes to pass the ball so the run game will be an occasional change up. Trevone Boykin is mobile, so Dale Pierson and Demond Tucker will have their hands full up front for the second week in a row. \nAdvantage: TCU \nTCU PASS OFFENSE VS. ISU PASS DEFENSE \nPaul Rhoads and defensive coordinator Wally Burnham defended Iowa State's 3-4 scheme — in Burnham's case passionately — after the loss to Texas Tech with missed tackles and poor angles as the source of problems. Trevone Boykin is throwing for 350.5 yards per game — second in the Big 12 — and Josh Doctson is catching 8.3 balls for 146.2 yards per game. The ISU defense will have to learn from its past mistakes in a hurry. \nAdvantage: TCU \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nCole Netten's mysterious struggles continued last week when he missed a 40-yard field goal. Paul Rhoads expects Netten to kick Saturday, but has held a competition involving walk-on Chris Francis this week. Punter Colin Downing is steady at 41.8 yards per kick. If Allen Lazard can capitalize on punt returns, it will be a shot in the arm for the ISU offense, but TCU punter Ethan Perry averages 39 yards per kick and has put 11 inside the 20. \nAdvantage: TCU \nINTANGIBLES \n1. TCU leads the all-time series with Iowa State 5-1 and is 2-0 in Ames. One of the Horned Frogs' five wins was in the 2005 EV1.net Houston Bowl, 27-24. \n2. Against TCU, Iowa State will be in the middle of a three-game stretch of playing the top three offenses in college football. Texas Tech (2 nd —631.7), TCU (3 rd —615.5) and Baylor (1 st —725.0). \n3. Mike Warren is leading all FBS freshmen in rushing yards (114.8) and yards per carry (8.1). His 245 yards last week is the eighth-best mark in Iowa State history while his 574 yards this season — through five games — already claimed an ISU freshman season record. \n3 AND OUT \n1. Iowa State has lost 12 straight games against ranked opponents with its last win coming against No. 15 TCU 37-23 on October 6, 2012 in Fort Worth, Texas. \n2. The No. 3 Horned Frogs will be the first ranked opponent the Cyclones have played this season. Iowa (No. 17) and Toledo (No. 22) are currently in the top 25, but not at the time they played against Iowa State. \n3. TCU director of football operations Matt Lewis served as the ISU head equipment manager from 2002-04 while Horned Frogs linebacker coach Demontie Cross was on the ISU staff from 2001-05. \nISU WILL WIN IF… it can create a couple turnovers and control time of possession. Against the air raid, it's unlikely Iowa State can stop TCU, but the goal is to be in the right spots and be active. The Cyclones' newcomers on defense have now seen speed in the Big 12, but the offense needs to keep its end of the deal and put up enough points to take pressure off the defense. \nTCU WILL WIN IF… it can make Sam Richardson uncomfortable and contain the run. Mike Warren had 245 yards on 23 carries last week, but zero touchdowns. Texas Tech's formula for success was containing the run, scoring fast and making Richardson uncomfortable early. The Horned Frogs will probably be watching a lot of last week's film on the Cyclones. \nPREDICTION: TCU 52, Iowa State 28 Your Next College Football Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:07:38.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
