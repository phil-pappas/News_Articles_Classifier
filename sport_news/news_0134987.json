The Americans have won the gold trophy five straight times, and the lone International victory was in 1998 in Australia. \n\"We need to win,\" Louis Oosthuizen said. \"This is huge for us.\" \nThe South Africa duo of Grace and Oosthuizen have been the driving force for captain Nick Price. They became the first International tandem to go 4-0 in team matches. Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker in 2009 are the only U.S. team to do that. \nJordan Spieth also won two matches Saturday, making two clutch putts in morning foursomes, and holing a bunker shot in the afternoon fourballs. Spieth was 8 under on his own ball. The only drama was whether to finish. They played the final hole in the dark, to avoid having to return to complete it Sunday morning. \nPhil Mickelson and Zach Johnson never trailed in their fourballs victory at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea. \nBae Sang-moon and Hideki Matsuyama, who earned a key half-point in the morning, had the shortest match of the week when they beat Jimmy Walker and Chris Kirk, 6 and 5, in fourballs. Bae is playing his final event before his mandatory military service starts in South Korea. \n\"One of the best matches I ever played,\" Bae said. \nThe singles matches were moved up one hour because of rain in the forecast, with Oosthuizen facing Patrick Reed in the opening match. U.S. captain Jay Haas put Spieth in the ninth match against Marc Leishman, passing on a chance to put Spieth against Jason Day. \n\"I don't know if it was a make-or-break the Presidents Cup if they played or didn't play,\" Haas said. \nSuddenly, finally, the Presidents Cup doesn't need a special match to be compelling. Haas wanted Spieth in the No. 9 slot because historically that's about where it's decided when the matches are close going into the final session. \nDay is in the 10th spot against Zach Johnson. \nOn the longest day of the week — two sessions of four matches — this could have gone either way. \nThe last three morning matches all went to the 18th hole. Spieth and Dustin Johnson won the last two holes for a 1-up win over Day and Charl Schwartzel, while Matsuyama made birdie on the last hole for a halve, and Bubba Watson missing a 5-foot birdie on the 18th that would have given his side a win. \nThe teams split both sessions. \nThe pivotal match belonged to Grace and Oosthuizen, who were all square with the big-hitting American duo of Watson and J.B. Holmes. Grace was left of the green on the 16th when he chipped in, raising his arms before the ball even reached the cup and sharing a bear hug with his longtime South African friend. \nOosthuizen had a chance to end it on the par-3 17th — the first time the South Africans played that hole in competition all week — but he missed a 6-foot putt when it was so dark he couldn't see the line. \nThe four players could barely see the 18th green because of the darkness. Oosthuizen hit into the water, and it was so dark that Grace didn't even know it. From 263 yards with a chilly wind in his face, he blasted a 3-wood that narrowly cleared a bunker and settled on the edge of the green. \n\"I haven't seen the shot, so I don't know where it finished or how it got to where it did,\" Grace said. \"Just remarkable to pull a shot off like that.\" \nHolmes and Watson, needing to win the hole to earn a halve, both missed the green and Grace rolled his eagle putt to tap-in range to close it out. \n\"The chip-in on 16 and the second into 18 showed he's a world-class player,\" Oosthuizen said. \"No moment is too big for him.\" \nOosthuizen said they went to Price after they won their opening match Thursday and offered to split up, knowing both were playing well and thinking perhaps they could bring another International player along. Price chose to keep them together, and it paid off. \n\"They've been the stars of our team,\" Price said. \nThe Americans still have the lead, though the Presidents Cup has been so lopsided since 2005 that it almost feels like an International lead. History is still against the International team. No team trailing going into the last day has ever won. \nStill, the vibe was strong for the International team and the Americans could sense it, too. \n\"To me, it kind of feels like we're losing just because of what's gone on the last two days,\" Zach Johnson said. \"But our first day was substantial. So yeah, you knew it was going to be tight going into Sunday regardless of what happened.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:32:09.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
