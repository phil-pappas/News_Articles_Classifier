Spartans open district play against Kapaun By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nEmporia High enters district play with the same record (3-3) as last year, but this Spartan team begins its push to the playoffs with a much different feel. \n“This team is much more confident than the team last year,” EHS head coach Corby Milleson said. “They’re just much more focused. I’ve said it all along, it’s just a different team chemistry-wise.” \nThe Spartans enter Friday’s district opener against Kapaun as winner of three of their last four games. Compared to last year when they lost their final Centennial League game 35-20 to Seaman, who they beat last week 40-20, the Spartans’ confidence is warranted. \n“We’re stepping up and we’re leading,” EHS lineman Max Brown said of the Spartans’ senior class, with him included in that group. “The word of this week is effort. We’re all exemplifying it really well, and it’s a good word for this week.” \nKapaun (4-2) boasts a powerful passing attack, led by 6-foot-2 senior Brock Monty, who has scholarship offers from Air Force, Cornell and Harvard, according to Rivals. \n“I mean, he’s good,” Brown said of Monty. “We’re working on our pass rushes and our D-line stuff this week.” \nThe Crusaders have used Monty’s passing abilities more frequently this year, as he’s thrown for 1,485 yards and 11 touchdowns this season. He’s also spread the ball out well, with six receivers having caught eight or more passes and five of them bringing in at least one touchdown. \n“They want to throw the football. When they to have run it, they get in the power-I and I and they’ve got a couple backs who are really nice backs,” Milleson said. “But they definitely want to throw it.” \nMonty also leads his team in rushing attempts (66), but senior Alexander Norris holds the Crusaders’ most rushing yards at 212 on 40 attempts that includes five touchdowns. \n“I wouldn’t say they’re a one-dimensional team by any stretch,” Milleson said. “Of course they’re highlighting Brock a lot. He’s a big quarterback with a strong arm.” \nThe Crusaders’ defense brings the Spartans a unique challenge, changing from a four- to three-man front during the season. The difference makes Emporia’s preparation out of the flexbone more difficult in determining certain reads. \n“The way they play their stack will give us some problems with our reads,” Milleson said. “So there’s a lot to prepare for there just in itself, getting ready to read different people than we’re used to reading.” \n“And getting ready for Brock Monty and their passing game is a pretty big challenge,” added the second-year head coach, whose defense has held opponents to 20 points or less in the Spartans’ three wins this season. \nKapaun topped the Spartans 21-0 last year, with the game turning toward the Crusaders on a handful of key plays. \nWith Emporia’s focus on effort, Brown said the Spartans have bought into a one-play-at-a-time mentality. \n“No wasted reps in practice,” he said. “We know every single play matters.” \nThe trip to Wichita, for the game played at Cessna Stadium on Wichita State’s campus, is the second of three straight road games in a five of six-game stretch away from home for Emporia. So far, the Spartans have won two of three road games, which Milleson credits to a few things. \n“I think we’re a road team every time you got to get on a bus to get anywhere. Even playing at home (Welch Stadium), there’s nothing that identifies Emporia High School except the pads on the goal posts,” Milleson said. “I think that traveling doesn’t really affect these guys because they’ve done it so much for so long. They know how to prepare well, and I think that’s just a compliment to our kids.” \nBrown agreed. \n“We just focus up. We know it’s a business trip,” said Brown, whose team will close district play against Wichita Heights (4-2) and Andover (1-5). “We know it’s time to get down and get dirty. We’re ready to go.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:07:50.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
