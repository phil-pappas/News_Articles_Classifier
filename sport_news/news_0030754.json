French jockey Jean-Bernard Eyquem had the perfect race and took an early lead over her and the other seven rivals that included her stable and training partner, Bellone du Croate. \nGidwa, owned by Sheikh Mohammed al Thani, battled for the second place with Al Shaqab Racing’s Bint Jakkarta, but eventually finished behind Sylvine, leaving the third place to Gidwa. \nShahwarzi holds aloft the winner’s trophy at Longchamp racecourse in France \nSpeaking over phone from Longchamp, Shahwarzi said, “This is the biggest win in the history of Oman. I am very happy that our horses have started earning victories at the top classic races.” \nThe Royal Cavalry chief added, “Our horses are doing well at the big classic races and it has been a result of our decision to have the horses based in France. Most of the world's famous races are organised in France from April to the end of October. We have had some good results this season.” \nJean-Pierre Deroubaix, racing manager for the Royal Cavalry stables, said, “It is a great success. This year, we won several Group 1 races. The Royal Cavalry of Oman started from scratch five years ago and it now has more than 100 horses in France. Sylvine is from a very good family. She will be a solid base for breeding. \n“Sylvine has a lot of class. She proved that she is capable of winning against the best of her generation. Du Croate, her stable and training partner, cannot show the same success. She was entered to ensure a good pace for the favourite and we are happy that it worked.” \nWorood is second On Friday, the Royal Cavalry's Worood gave a tough fight to eventual winner Mabrooka in the Qatar Total Arabian Trophy for fillies (Group 1 Purebred Arabians) at Saint-Cloud's racecourse. \nMabrooka, the 2015 champion filly, owned by H H Sheikh Mansoor bin Zayed al Nahyan, showed a real turn of foot to come back up from behind and attack Worood a few metres from the post. \nWorood accelerated enough to catch up with the leaders and hoped for victory in front of the favourite, but she did not resist. However, she finished well, taking second place in front of Naziq, another H H Sheikh Mansoor bin Zayed al Nahyan-owned filly. Naziq led the field at the beginning of the race and managed to take the third place. \nAlsaker comes third Earlier in the day, Muraaqib clinched the Qatar Arabian Trophy for colts (Group 1 Purebred Arabians), pushing R B Burn to the second spot. Alsaker, owned by the Royal Cavalry of Oman and trained by Thomas Fourcy, rounded up the top three. \nMuraaqib, the three year old colt owned by H H Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al Maktoum, was held up in the middle of the field during the race and fought back for the victory in the middle of the home straight.
