Carneiro has since parted company with the club. \nThere had been suggestions Mourinho had used abusive language towards Carneiro but the FA, after having an independent academic expert in Portuguese linguistics analyse footage of the incident , announced it ''is satisfied that the words used do not constitute discriminatory language under FA Rules''. \nA statement said: ''Women in Football (WiF) are appalled by the conclusion of the FA investigation into Jose Mourinho's conduct during, and following, Chelsea's match against Swansea on 8th August 2015. \n''Contrary to the FA's appointed expert's advice, which WiF has not seen, our own language expert made it abundantly clear that the abusive words used by Mr Mourinho on the touchline that day were specifically directed towards a woman, as indicated by the grammar of his sentence. Other Portuguese speakers we contacted in gathering evidence also emphasised this point. We therefore find it extraordinary that any expert or Portuguese speaker would report otherwise. \n''WiF can only conclude that this latest investigation provides yet another damning example of the FA failing to tackle discrimination, specifically sexism, in the football industry. Once again we are concerned by what we can only perceive as serious flaws in the process of such investigations.'' \nThe FA felt moved to defend its process after Women in Football questioned its verdict. \nThe FA added: ''The linguistic was native Portuguese and has taught at the highest level universities in both Portugal and the UK with many published works on both Portuguese lexicography and lexicology and Portuguese linguistics including modern day vernacular.'' \nMourinho was upset with Carneiro and head physiotherapist Jon Fearn for entering the field of play to treat Hazard in the closing stages of the Blues' 2-2 Premier League draw against the Swans. \nThat meant the Blues were temporarily down to nine men - goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois ahead already been sent off - after Hazard left the field, and although the incident did not have an impact on the result Carneiro and Fearn were criticised for being ''impulsive and naive'' by Mourinho. \nThe Portuguese's comments attracted plenty of scorn, but the 52-year-old was unrepentant and earned further condemnation when it was announced Carneiro would no longer attend club matches or training sessions. \nEarlier this month it was announced Carneiro had parted company with the Blues and it is understood likely she will launch legal action claiming constructive dismissal.
