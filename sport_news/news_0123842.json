But I thought Ridgedale played really hard and well.” \nDespite absorbing another loss, Rockets’ coach Pat Ballenger was very pleased with his team’s effort. \n“This was huge,” Ballenger said. “We scored more points tonight than the rest of the season combined. We didn’t make as many turnovers. We executed for a change.” \nRidgedale (0-9, 0-7 N10) grabbed an early 7-0 lead. Hunter Boyd raced 41 yards for a score on the Rockets’ second possession. The junior finished the night with 150 yards on 26 carries and two touchdowns. \nBucyrus (2-7, 1-6) answered with a 19-yard run from Bailey Johnston to cut the deficit to 7-6. Johnston nearly matched Boyd, rushing for 146 yards on 24 tries and two scores. \n“Boyd ran very hard tonight,” Eckert said. “That’s the best I’ve seen Ridgedale play.” \nThe Redmen got a takeaway on the Rockets’ next possession when Jon Metz fell on a fumble. But Bucyrus gave it back, in spades, three plays later when Alex Brown intercepted a pass and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown to give Ridgedale 14-6 lead. \n“We changed some things up a little just for them,” Ballenger said. “It got them off their game a little. Our offensive line started to feel it.” \nJohnson knotted the game at 14-14 with a 5-yard run. Then Metz’ second fumble recovery at Ridgedale’s 8 set up a two-yard run by quarterback Gavin Lewis and a 20-14 halftime lead for the Redmen, who outgained the Rockets, 199-34 in the first two quarters, but led by only six. \nBucyrus missed a golden opportunity to take control of the game by turning the ball over on downs at the Ridgedale 6. The Rockets turned it around with a 94-yard drive capped by Boyd’s 43-yard jaunt, which tied it at 20-20. \n“It’s old hat now,” Eckert said. “We’ve been through it. We get some things going and then we shoot ourselves in the foot.” \nFreshman Harley Robinson promptly returned the ensuing kickoff 77 yards to give the Redmen a 26-20 lead in the seesaw affair. Boyd’s 3-yard run gave the Rockets a 27-26 lead with 8:45 left, but Bucyrus would not be denied. \nLewis hooked up with Zane Richardson on a 10-yard scoring pass to give the Redmen a 32-27 lead with just over five minutes left and they were able to hold on for the win. \n“We’ve been down at half all year long,” Ballenger said. “We play better in the second half. We came out with a different attitude.” \n“We did enough to win, despite the turnovers,” Eckert said. “I’d much rather be talking about a win any way we get it.” \nTwitter: @TF_Schmidt 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1S1Q7vj TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:12:15.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
