Revenge for Deflategate. Brady-Luck. Thornton-Kravitz. Just don’t call in a rivalry. The definition of \"rivalry\" via Google : \" competition for the same objective or for superiority in the same field.\" With that in mind, whatever is going on right now between New England and Indy, that ain't it. A rivalry has a back-and-forth, with wins from both sides. There’s an edge there, usually in the form of trash talk. And there’s a mean-spiritedness and contempt that has to bubble up organically. And while there’s some edge from the Patriots going into this contest — thanks to Ryan Grigson and the rest of the Indy franchise setting the wheels for Deflategate in motion — there’s no sense of the Colts being able to pull the upset. There’s no outward anger from either locker room. Heck, the only member of the Colts who had the potential to make things even remotely spicy this time around based on what happened last year is now a defensive back for the Jaguars . Even without Deflategate, history certainly doesn’t suggest that the Colts have enjoyed anything remotely resembling a level playing field in the previous 18 games between the two teams: Dating back to 2001, the Patriots have won 13 of the last 18 games between the two teams, including the last six games. And in the last four games, New England posted at least 42 points in every game, and it has won those contests by an average of 29 points. In each of the last four games, the Colts have scored fewer points than they did in the previous game. For some perspective, in New England's last four games against the Jaguars, the Patriots have won all four, with an average margin of victory of 20 points per game. As a result, at this point there’s little reason to call Pats-Colts a rivalry — at least until Indy wins something. But that got us to thinking: Who is the Patriots’ chief rival? In our mind, a true rivalry means a relatively level playing field when it comes to wins and losses on both sides, as well as a refusal to be intimidated whether you’re at home or on the road, as well as a certainly indefinable irritability that usually manifests itself in trash talk from the likes of Terrell Suggs or Joey Porter . With that being the case, here is the AFC edition of New England’s rivalry rankings. 1. Denver: The Broncos are competitive enough, they have a counterpoint to Tom Brady at the quarterback position in Peyton Manning , and while they haven’t won a Super Bowl since John Elway stopped playing, they have belonged in the conversation the last four years or so. There’s no real villain there, but the comments from Emmanuel Sanders over the summer certainly gives hope to the fact that things could get interesting in the days leading up to their November showdown. (As long as both sides remain healthy, that matchup between the New England offense and the Denver defense will be a battle between the two best units in the league.) 2. Baltimore: There’s no arguing the fact that John Harbaugh and the rest of the crew from Baltimore have struggled to start the 2015 season (and that’s the biggest reason why we’ve knocked them down to No. 2 in our overall rankings), but no other team has been able to consistently come into Foxboro and give the Patriots fits more than the Ravens. They check off all the boxes you need in a true rival: Baltimore has won enough to consider the Patriots-Ravens matchup a real rivalry , and the Ravens are usually mentally tough (unless you throw an unbalanced line at them). They have remained competitive over an extended stretch, and they have a clear contempt for all things New England and the local football fan base. In short, it’s still easy for Patriots fans to dislike the Ravens. Even with their slow start. 3. Pittsburgh: The Steelers have always carried themselves as a rival of the Patriots, and they have the titles, multiple wins over New England, trash-talk skills and the irritability to earn a spot in the top 3. Toss in an occasional shot across the bow of the Patriots in the form of Mike Tomlin and Headsetgate , and you have all the elements of a true rival. 4. Indianapolis: The Colts simply aren’t there just yet. Sure, there’s always been bitterness between the respective brain trusts — which manifested itself frequently in former Indy GM Bill Polian making a spectacle of himself whenever he sat in the Gillette Stadium press box during Patriots-Colts games. But Indy hasn’t been able to enjoy enough success against New England as of late to take the Colts as seriously as the Broncos , Ravens and Steelers. Indy’s high-water mark came in 2005 and 2006 when the Colts won three straight, including the 2006 AFC title game. But since the infamous 4th and 2 game in 2009 at Lucas Oil Stadium, it’s pretty much been all New England, all the time. 5. New York Jets : Rex’s spiral the last couple of years dropped the Jets out of the top 3, but the re-emergence of Darrelle Revis as a villain certainly has the potential to stoke the flames of the rivalry again. However, for it to reach the same levels of 2009 and 2010, the Jets need to string together some victories over the Patriots to reclaim their spot as one of New England’s chief rivals. 6. Buffalo: The Bills have beaten the Patriots just twice since 2001, but the Rex Factor bumps them into the Top 10. There was plenty of feistiness from Buffalo in the Week 2 clash between the two teams, which could mean things have the potential to get spicy in the coming years, as long as Rex hangs around and the Bills can pull off a win or two. 7. San Diego: Like Oakland, this rivalry has had its intense moments — between the 2006 AFC divisional game between the Chargers and Patriots, as well as the 2007 AFC title game, these two sides have been able to generate some bad blood. LaDainian Tomlinson and Philip Rivers probably still hold a grudge for the postgame dancing that several New England players engaged in following the 2006 playoff win in Southern California. The rivalry has dissipated in recent years, but they still get points for past feistiness . 8. Houston: The memorable decision for the brash young Texans to wear their letterman’s jackets into Gillette Stadium in 2012 drew the attention of New England football fans , but other than that, Houston has struggled to gain relevance in the eyes of the Patriots. The run-up to this year’s contest certainly has the potential to be interesting, but it’ll be hard to generate animosity for a team that has so many New England connections, including Bill O’Brien, Mike Vrabel , Vince Wilfork , Ryan Mallett and Brian Hoyer . 9. Cincinnati: With the Bengals quick start, there’s potential to build on something there when it comes to a possible rivalry with Cincinnati. If the Bengals are able to consistently win in January -- and provide a real level of competition for New England when the postseason rolls around -- there’s potential for this to jump up a few notches. But as it stands right now, the Bengals aren’t quite on the radar when it comes to the Patriots’ chief rivals. 10. Miami: This feels like it should be a little higher -- since 2003, they were the only team other than the Patriots to win the AFC East. And if they had been able to build on last year’s season-opening win over New England down in South Florida (which came on the heels of a dramatic victory against the Patriots in December 2013), it might be. But with the recent coaching change, it remains to be seen what sort of competition Miami will provide for New England, at least while Brady and Belichick are still around. 11. Oakland: The Raiders were New England’s chief tormentors for a l ng time, and so a decade or so ago, Oakland would have been in the top 10. But with their recent struggles, they’ve slipped a bit. 12. Kansas City: Last year’s Monday Night beatdown was probably the most memorable recent moment between these two franchises, and while it will almost certainly be referenced the next time these two teams play, there’s not much rivalry to speak of, at least at this point. 13. Cleveland: It’s been two decades since he was there, but given the way things ended, Cleveland isn’t too fond of Bill Belichick . But other than that, there’s no other reason to think of the Browns as a rival, even if Mike Pettine keeps telling stories like this one . 14. Jacksonville: Who can hate the Jaguars? 15. Tennessee: The Titans will make their first visit to Gillette Stadium since 2009 when the Patriots set a franchise record for most points in a game. But with a young team and rookie quarterback at the helm in Marcus Mariota, it’s safe to say that the pregame hype for that one won’t be in the same neighborhood as the contest this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:48:16.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
