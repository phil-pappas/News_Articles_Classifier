While a win’s a win, there were definitely several causes for concern after watching the Patriots labor through the Sunday afternoon contest. If they hope to keep this revenge tour going, they’ll have to address those problems quickly with Miami coming to town Thursday night. 1. After missing Brandon LaFell for the first five games, it almost seemed like he hadn’t played football in a year. LaFell’s locker room presence after the game pretty much summed up how his first game of the 2015 season went. He sat in front of his locker, with his back to the media, and took a long time getting ready, while everyone swarmed around Danny Amendola, just a few lockers to his right. Finally, after he put his Oklahoma City Thunder hat and Coach backpack on, he turned and answered questions about his disappointing display. “If I had to give myself a grade, it would be an ‘F,’” he explained. “I let the ball get out of my hands too many times. Tom (Brady) threw some good balls — I should have caught them. But, overall we got the win. I just have to get back to it; we have a short week. Dust the cobwebs off and come back out her and play.” He wasn’t kidding when he said he dropped too many balls either. LaFell was targeted eight times and had two receptions. The other six incompletions were all drops on very catchable balls. “I was just trying to forget about the play before and try to keep moving forward,” LaFell said. “After the first one, I felt (like what’s going on)? Kind of got down on myself, but Tom kept telling me he was going to come back to me, coaches kept telling me to make plays.\" LaFell will get a quick shot at redemption Thursday, but that also doesn’t leave much time to adjust. 2. The Patriots’ No. 1 corner seemed to be challenged more than ever by Sunday’s assignment. Malcolm Butler has been tested throughout the season by some of the game’s best, but Eric Decker seemed to be the toughest he’s faced. “It’s the NFL, everybody in this league is good,” Butler said. “But, I think I did well enough to hold him off.” That’s debatable, given the sixth-year man out of Minnesota was targeted 12 times on the afternoon and had six receptions for 94 yards. Butler was also called for pass interference once, and both defensive holding and illegal use of hands on another play. Although things seemed chippy between Butler and Decker, the second-year cornerback tried to show respect to his adversary in the locker room. “They’ve got to get paid, too,” Butler stated. “It’s not an easy position to play.” Decker also expressed his physicality with Butler after the game. “There was a lot of man coverage, and for me (I had to) be physical,” he explained. “Butler is a speed guy. He’s smart and I had to be able to maneuver my way through and try and use my size against him.” 3. Darrell Revis didn’t have much to say about his return. The cornerback had his first game against the Patriots since he helped them win the Super Bowl earlier this year, and quickly realized what it’s like to be on the other side of a New England win and a Brady fourth-quarter comeback. “We tried to switch things up on Tom and show him different looks, but Tom is great,” he said. “He suckered in the defense, that’s what he did down the stretch.” Revis Island was primarily occupied by Julian Edelman for the afternoon, and the ex-Patriot was nothing but complimentary of his former teammate. “Any receiver I go up against is going to be one of the top guys in the league,” Revis stated. “My job description is to cover some of the greatest receivers.” Edelman, however, didn’t have much to say about the reunion. “It was good,” he said. “It was good to go out there and compete, and he played well.” Although Bill Belichick isn’t his coach anymore, Revis had a very Belichick-esque answer to what it was like being back at Gillette Stadium. “It’s just a Week 7 game.” 4. With the focus on Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski all afternoon, another wide receiver found his opportunity to shine. Danny Amendola has faced a large sum of scrutiny in his time with New England, but he came to play against the Jets. The 5-foot-11 receiver had 86 yards off eight receptions, missing only one target. His biggest play came an eight-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter that put New England up 23-20, and they never looked back. Although he carried himself confidently with the media, Amendola didn’t elaborate much on his performance. He did discuss his game winning score, briefly. “It’s just a play that we’ve been working on for a long time,” he said. “They gave us the coverage that we like and it ended up working out.” 5. For the first time in his star-studded career, Tom Brady was the leading rusher for the Patriots. No it wasn’t because Tom Terrific ran the ball exceptionally well — he only had 15 yards on four carries — it was due to the fact that the Patriots never handed the ball off. With running backs Dion Lewis and Brandon Bolden not in the game, the Patriots were left with LeGarrette Blount and James White to bear the load. Blount had -3 yards on three carries, and White had four yards on two tries. Although White did catch three of his five targets for 26 yards, the tandem hardly did enough to accent the passing game.
