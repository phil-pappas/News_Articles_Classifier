Anders Nilsson made 33 stops. \nMatt Bartkowski scored in regulation for Vancouver (3-1-2), which got 22 saves from Ryan Miller. \nTied 1-1 through 40 minutes, Canucks forward Daniel Sedin was left shaking his head early in the third period after somehow chipping a puck that was lying in the crease over the Oilers’ goal with Nilsson down and out following a great stop on a Henrik Sedin breakaway seconds earlier. \nNilsson then made a diving save on Radim Vrbata with under seven minutes to go before Yakupov had a good chance on Miller with 90 seconds to play in the third. \nEdmonton opened the scoring at 3:23 of the first period on the power play after some excellent work from Connor McDavid. The No. 1 pick at June’s draft, who had two goals and an assist in Calgary on Saturday, picked up the puck in the neutral zone and stepped around a check before feeding Yakupov for a one-timer that beat Miller from the slot. \nVancouver tied it at 15:43 when Bartkowski scored his first regular-season goal in the NHL. Playing in his 138th game, the defenceman fired a shot from the point that nicked an Edmonton player on the way through and found its way past Nilsson. \nThe Canucks entered Sunday 8-2-0 against the Oilers over the clubs’ last 10 meetings, including a perfect 5-0-0 record last season, and had plenty of chances to grab the lead in the second period. \nDaniel Sedin had two opportunities early before Brandon Sutter sent a backhand wide. Sven Baertschi then moved in alone on a breakaway after a big collision in the neutral zone, but Nilsson made a nice save. \nMiller had to be sharp at the other end with about eight minutes to go in the period, stopping Korpikoski on back-to-back opportunities from in close. \nThe Canucks’ power play, a woeful 1 for 18 coming into the game, got its first chance late in the second, with Daniel Sedin’s redirect from the slot the closest Vancouver would come. \nNotes: Edmonton opens a three-game homestand Wednesday against the Detroit Red Wings. ... Vancouver continues its five-game homestand Thursday against the Washington Capitals. ... Bartkowski’s only other goal came in Game 7 of the Boston Bruins’ memorable first-round series with the Toronto Maple Leafs back in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:42:42.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
