He was freed on $30,000 bond with sentencing set for Jan. 22.\nOfficer Daryle Holloway was shot and killed by a suspect he was transporting who somehow got a gun into the police car. Johnson was one of the officers who had arrested the suspect, Travis Boys, in an assault case before he was transported.\nPolice said they uncovered evidence that Johnson disregarded evidence during Boys' assault arrest, failed to adequately pat down Boys and tried to cover up his shoddy work later.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:00:59.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
