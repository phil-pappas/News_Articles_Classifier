The side that is hungrier is going to win this game on Sunday. We went back to Liverpool on Monday night and tried to recover as soon as possible. It was then that we started focusing on the derby.\nHe added: \"I will work hard on Sunday like I did at West Brom and whenever I go on the pitch I want to work hard, help my team-mates and help us win. I want to win the game and score.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:36:21.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
