Edwards lost Thursday’s match to Kent Denver’s Casey Ross 6-1, 6-3, but when Ross made quick work of his semifinal opponent, Edwards and the players who lost to the two finalists were re-entered into the tournament’s playback bracket for a chance to claim third place. Edwards quickly disposed of Pueblo Central’s Adam Guerrero, the first round victim of Ross, 6-1, 6-0. After his second win of the tournament, Edwards was up against the semifinal loser to Ross, Max Petrak of Niwot, and lost a tough 6-4, 6-2 battle to end his third consecutive trip to the state tournament. “Fred went down early and scrapped his way back,” Durango head coach Dave Weisfeldt said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “We tried some different things but this kid (Petrak) was good, and he was ready for everything.” As a senior next year, Edwards will have a chance to make the state tournament all four years he’s played for Durango High School. After this year’s dominance in the region, he will be a favorite to get back next year. “It was another phenominal year for him,” Weisfeldt said. “He continues to grow and his attitude toward the game keeps getting better, and his focus is getting sharper. He’s just a great talent.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:54:22.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
