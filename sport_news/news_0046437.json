In addition to the winner, Brown saddled Consumer Credit to a third-place finish and Light in Paris, an Irish bred who ran last in her U.S. debut.\nPartisan Politics parlayed an ideal trip into her second win in eight starts. Javier Castellano guided her to an ideal staking trip. Never worse than third, Partisan Politics edged to the front a furlong from the finish and gradually lengthened the margin over the runner up.\n''She's the kind of horse you need to have in good position,'' Castellano said. ''I was a little aggressive today and it paid off. She finished really well.''\nPartisan Politics paid $7, $3.60 and $2.70. Devine Aida returned $8.10 and $4.40, and Consumer Credit paid $2.50 to show.\nThe time was 1:34.43 over the firm course.\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing Partisan Politics   4236/79545   1090/5681   354/10000  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:23:54.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
