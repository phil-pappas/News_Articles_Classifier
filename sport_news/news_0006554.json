Posted: Sunday, October 25, 2015 4:00 am Would Rich Rodriguez be welcome back to WVU? By Bob Hertzel For the Times West Virginian Times West Virginian \nMORGANTOWN — Eventually, as West Virginia University’s football season seems to be deteriorating again and the “Dump Dana” drums begin beating louder, it had to happen … and it has. \nThe Internet is rife with rumors about the possibility of Rich Rodriguez returning to his native state to take back his old job. At the same time, there are strong indications that Rodriguez may be the target of former WVU executive director of athletic development, Whit Babcock, now AD at Virginia Tech as his hand-picked replacement for long-time Hokie football coach Frank Beamer when he retires. \nThe Internet rumors have gone so far as to include this unsubstantiated report that says Rodriguez could be leaving Arizona for one of the two destinations as early as next season. \n“Major donors in WV have ‘escorted’ WVU AD (Shane) Lyons to Arizona on private jets twice since WVU entered the death stretch of losses in October. They are already quietly raising the money to pay out Holgorsen’s contract and Rodriguez’s buyout in AZ. The only catch is VT AD Whit Babcock, who is a long time RR confidant. Either way, looks like RR is back east in ’16. Either home to replace the red bull addict Holgorsen or to the worst Virginia to replace a struggling Beamer,” the report read. \nThis is not meant to verify or deny those rumors at this time, as no one is speaking either on or off the record, least of all Lyons, who has been the invisible man since taking over from Oliver Luck. \nInstead, this is to raise the question of whether Rodriguez ever could be welcomed back into his home state after leaving for Michigan following the devastating upset to 28-point underdog Pitt when he brought a Mountaineer team with Pat White and Steve Slaton to the verge of playing for the 2007 national championship. \nHis departure was unexpected and done in the most brusque and unfeeling of ways, which has many people in the state claiming on social media that if he would return they would cancel tickets and never watch another WVU football game. \nOf course, there is another side to that story, fans who would welcome him back in hopes of recapturing the past glories, the 11-win seasons and exciting brand of football on both sides of the ball that Holgorsen has not been able to deliver in four years as head coach. \nPerhaps we can learn more about the future by looking back at the past, and so it was that we looked upon two television pieces concerning Rodriguez’s departure and the ugly reaction to it that went so far that members of his family received death threats. \nOne feature was an ESPN “Outside the Lines” piece from 2008, just a couple of months after he left for Michigan; another was an interview on an Arizona TV show in 2014 giving his take on the events that transpired. \nThe “Outside the Lines” program put great emphasis on the animosity Rodriguez created by leaving and the way he exited, much of which still lingers on today, nearly a decade later. \nRodriguez addressed it with Bob Ley on ESPN, saying, “This is America. You are allowed to change jobs. I changed jobs and the level of hatred is probably unprecedented.” \nHe noted later, in an emotional scene where a few tears were shed, that the animosity spread from him to his entire family and that was hard to take. \n“My kids are 11 and 9,” he said, wiping away a tear. “I wish some people — the majority of people have been great — but I wish some of the people that are ignorant and don’t know or don’t care what they are saying would see what it does to young people that had no impact in this decision. My kids shouldn’t have to endure things like that. My nephews and my nieces, to put a death threat on them because their uncle changed jobs? Give me a break.” \nRemember to put this in context, for it was just a few months after his departure. \nTime has healed some of these wounds for those who felt betrayed by Rodriguez and for Rodriguez himself. Certainly the cast of characters at WVU has changed completely. \nThe situation leading up to his departure was a jumbled one. A year earlier he had been offered the Alabama job and when WVU reworked his contract he decided to stay, saying at the press conference to announce his decision to remain, “Obviously I’m very excited about being here and plan on staying here a long time.” \nThat made a lot of the wealthy boosters who had donated money to make it work out feel secure. \nTom Klees, a Charleston lawyer and one of those boosters, put it this way on the “Outside the Lines” program: \n“A lot of people stepped up and made significant commitments and promises to keep him here. There was a sense of relief when that was over that OK, he’s not going to go anywhere.” \nA year later he was gone, a bid to get “total control” of the football program right down to having his own website, control over who was on the sidelines, the ability to allow his players to keep their books at the end of a semester having been turned down by President Mike Garrison and Athletic Director Ed Pastilong. \nIt became obvious the two sides were moving further and further apart, although little of this was public at the time. \nIn the 2014 interview he addressed what he would have done differently in his hasty departure without so much as an explanation or a press conference. He met in the team room with his team, was jeered by them as he announced his decision to leave, then departed out a side door and into a car and was gone. \n“If I could do one thing over again I would have a press conference at West Virginia and explain these things. I was kind of told to not do that by the next employer (Michigan),” Rodriguez said in the 2014 interview. “They said, ‘Hey, move on. Don’t do that.’ But I think I owed that to West Virginia, and it would have cleared a lot of things up. I could have said this is why I’m leaving. This why I’m taking this opportunity. You may not like it, but at least I’ve given you the upfront thing. \n“Sometimes the high road is not always the best. Sometimes staying on the level road and talking to the people is. I called a few people who had supported the program and gave them a heads up, but there were so many other people who supported the program, myself and my staff that I didn’t contact. If I had one thing to do over again, I would do that.” \nAnd what might he have told them? \n“People think I just got in a car and left for Michigan. No, no. I went back and talked to West Virginia. I went back and told them what was going on and gave them an opportunity to think about it and say ‘We want you to stay here and keep doing what you’re doing. We’re with you all the way,’” Rodriguez said. \n“When that meeting went the other way, they said we have done all we can for you, take it or leave. I almost felt like I was getting pushed out the door. That was my perception, but that’s what I felt. \n“I didn’t take the Michigan job without consulting with West Virginia first.” \nIf all that is true, could he possibly come home? If he did he would face a major public relations challenge, no doubt, and anything short of success would create a difficult situation. \nRodriguez understands that. His final quote in the “Outside the Lines” feature is evidence of that. \n“You always want to leave a place better than when you got there and you want to leave it so you can always go back. I think we have left it better than when we got there, but the hard part is I don’t know if we’re welcome back.” \nFollow Bob Hertzel on Twitter @bhertzel.
