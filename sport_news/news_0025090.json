The slaying and a string of other violent crimes tied to Garcia, who was 18 at the time of the killing, convinced a jury he should be put to death.\nHis lethal injection to be held in Huntsville would be the 11th this year in Texas, which carries out capital punishment more than any other state. Three more executions are scheduled in upcoming weeks.\nNo late appeals seeking to block the execution were in the courts on Monday. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected a clemency petition for Garcia on Friday.\nGarcia, his two cousins and another man had already carried out a carjacking when they spotted Solano during the early morning hours of Sept. 17, 1998, getting into his van to go to work, according to the evidence. Solano's relatives said the 36-year-old, who did Christian missionary work in Guadalajara, Mexico, had moved with his wife to Houston weeks earlier so their children could be educated in the U.S.\nEleazar Mendoza, who pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and was sentenced to 55 years in prison, testified that Garcia approached Solano and pointed a gun. Mendoza said Garcia gave Solano orders in Spanish to surrender any money he had and then shot him when he refused.\nGarcia, who spoke to the AP on a phone inside a caged-in visitors' area outside the state's death row, said it was Mendoza who came up with the idea to rob Solano and that Solano escalated the confrontation by resisting.\n\"He punches me. First thing that came through my mind is that the dude is going to try to kill me,\" Garcia said. \"He grabbed the gun with both of his hands and it discharged.\"\nSolano was shot four times in the head and neck. Garcia said he didn't rob Solano.\n\"My dad used to beat me,\" Garcia said. \"When that guy hit me, I was high on drugs and the first person I saw was my dad. So I kept shooting.\"\nCourt records show Garcia was in a car that was pulled over for a broken headlight more than a week after the killing. He was arrested for possession of a handgun when the weapon hit the floorboard as he was getting out of the car. He was released but arrested again later on an escape warrant as a juvenile fugitive when the gun was matched to Solano's slaying.\nAt Garcia's trial in Houston, authorities tied him to at least eight aggravated robberies and two attempted capital murders in the weeks before and after Solano's death. He also had an extensive juvenile record starting at age 12.\nAnother defendant, Raymond McBen, pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He was paroled a year ago.\nThe fourth man charged, Gabriel Morales, went to trial and was sentenced to life on a capital murder conviction.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
