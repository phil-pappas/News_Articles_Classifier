Over the 2012 and 2013 seasons, Evans caught 151 passes for 2,499 yards and 17 touchdowns, almost all of those passes coming from Manziel, who won the 2012 Heisman Trophy and was named the 2013 SEC offensive player of the year. \nEvans was back on the Texas A&M Saturday during the school’s game against Alabama , and the wide receiver paid tribute to his former teammate, wearing a Manziel jersey. \n— Colin Deaver (@KAGS_Colin) October 17, 2015 \nWhat’s interesting is that Evans wasn’t wearing Manziel’s jersey from his days with the Aggies, but rather, the quarterback’s jersey with his current team, the Cleveland Browns. Evans plays for a different NFL team, the Buccaneers, after both players were first-round picks in the 2014 draft. \nManziel was back in the news this week after getting pulled over earlier in the week amid a dispute with his girlfriend. No charges were filed, but the quarterback admitted to having had some drinks that day, this after spending several weeks in the spring in rehab for substance abuse. \nOn Saturday, Evans had this to say about his show of support for Manziel (via the Associated Press ): \n“That’s my boy man,” he said. “Got to support my bro.” \nThe Buccaneers are off this week on a bye.
