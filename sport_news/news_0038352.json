Near the end of 2012 it became more of a priority than being a cox, with Pavich seldom required by Rowing NZ without a regular senior men's eight at the time. \nPavich entered as a bantamweight at the Golden Gloves as he would have been unopposed as a flyweight and was looking to be selected in the New Zealand team to go to the Oceania champs in Canberra. \n\"I had two fights there and won them both - the first I put two standing eight counts on my opponent who'd finished runner-up at last year's nationals,\" Pavich said. \nHe then beat Smith and repeated the dose as a flyweight at the recent national champs in Invercargill through a unanimous decision. He topped that off by being awarded the prestigious Jameson Belt as the tournament's most scientific boxer. \n\"That was a real buzz - David Nyika won it last last year, Shane Cameron has won it ... there's a lot of big names on it.\" \nPavich also won silver while NZ team captain at the Oceania champs, losing a split decision his Papua New Guinean opponent. \n\"Unfortunately, in my weight division - and the one below me - only the gold medalist qualified for the world champs. In all the others it was gold and silver.\" \nBut Pavich still has big international ambitions. \n\"My medium-term goal is a gold medal at the next Commonwealth Games - and beyond that, looking at the Tokyo Olympics [in 2020].\" \nNext year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are still an outside possibility to, should he impress at the Asia/Oceania champs in China in March. \n\"If I could get to Rio ... I see that not as a major goal but as a stepping stone to achieving my other goals,\" he said. \nWhile rarely acting as a cox now, Pavich - who guided the NZ men's eight at the 2010 world champs at Lake Karaprio - is also starting to carve out an impressive coaching record in his third season of with Hamilton Boys' High School. After his novice charges won seven NZ secondary school titles in his debut coaching year, Pavich coached the HBHS under-16 age group this year to gold in the eight and silver in the quad. \n\"This year I'm working with the under-17 and under -18 squads, the Maadi Cup squad with Bruce Holden.\" \nPavich has watched with interest the success of the NZ men's eight this year, with the crew that contained the vast bulk of the two-time world champion boat at under-23 level qualifying for the Rio Olympics when narrowly missing a medal at the 2015 world champs in France. \n\"We were in a similar position to the current eight - we were quite young at the time, with an average age of about 23 or 24 and all the guys we were racing were about 28, 29. \n\"I feel we were forced out of it a little bit sooner than what everyone would have liked. Whereas if we'd been left for another cycle, that development would have been there. \n\"I see that as the learning that's been done from our process - they've kept the core group of the under-23 guys from last two years. It's great to see them and the women's eight doing really well.\" \nNow there's the prospect that Pavich could be competing at the Olympics alongside his former rowing colleagues. \n\"It'd be pretty special to be there and watch them at the same time.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:02:32.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
