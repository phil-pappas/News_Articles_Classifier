Check out what he had to say below concerning the bye week, a visit from Brian Dawkins , and the upcoming game Oct. 17 against Alabama\nOn Alabama game last season...\nSumlin: The fact that we were blown out, I don't know that it can have any positive impact at all. Starting this year, everyone is trying to compare this season to last. It is two different teams. There are a lot of people who played in the game last year that aren't even on the field.\nThere were changes in personnel, that was probably the biggest thing that came out of all of that. There were guys in critical roles and starting roles that were replaced. The last four games of the season we won a couple and were within a touchdown in the other two. Probably the biggest impact from that game last year was the personnel changes.\nMidseason bye week...\nSumlin: It just depends really on your luck during the year. There are teams that have players done for the year early, this is really the first week i've been able to pay attention to other things around the country. Notre Dame, Michigan lost some of their best players. Across the country you hope for the best.\nThere's no real way to say what the best time is for a bye week. For us right now it is good, we have played two SEC opponents, played a top 15 team to open the season, to win those games, open new Kyle Field, it comes at a good time for us.\nWe had a lot of rotation early at linebacker due to either suspension or injury. Obviously we have some guys that have played two pretty tough games recently, so it comes at a good time. Something we didn't have the luxury of last year. We went eight straight weeks last year, this season is very different.\nMental work during bye week...\nSumlin: They need time away from me. Time away from the media, who tell them how good or bad they are or how they screwed up. That's the truth.\nFor these guys, they are still kids, I think people forget about that. At the level we play at in this league, it's a really high level but it isn't professional football and I think people forget that. These guys go to class, they have mid terms and papers to turn it, they don't just come up here and play football.\nThis time of year you see teams not performing very well because there are other things going on, particularly for young guys. It's no coincidence you are starting to see the first round of exams come around, defenses are changing for young guys. The expectation is for the young guys to play as well as they did in the early part of the year.\nThe physical part is a big deal, but I also think there's a mental aspect that gets lft out. We are probably being more sensitive to it this year than last year.\nVisit from Brian Dawkins...\nSumlin: He's a guy we have a lot of respect for. He does a lot, had a tremendous NFL career, analyst on ESPN.. A number of the coaches have a lot of respect for him.\nWe got him in to speak to the team during fall camp, we have a number of guys do that. We really hit it off with him, the way he played the game with a passion. Really, for us, it was a good fit.\nAs he was here, he kind of understood, he hadn't done a lot of that. He bonded with our team, he was out here for three days this time. He's a guy that without asking him, you don't play at the level he played for that length of time, that you don't miss football at least a little bit. To be around our locker room, he loved that. And there's no doubt he's had an impact on a lot of our players individually.\nDifferences from 2014...\nSumlin: Biggest difference is different players. We have different players and the players who played at the end of the year, are a year older. We have a number of guys who aren't here anymore, so the chemistry of the team is completely different.\nWe have three new coaches, guys on the field who didn't play last year, and guys who are older and a year better like Donovan Wilson and Armani Watts, a number of guys playing pretty well.\nI don't know if I'm different, you guys can figure that out.\nBiggest question mark during bye week...\nSumlin: We got plenty of questions, that's why I'm here today.\nThis whole year, you've heard me talk about from day one, what we are trying to do is get better every week across the board.\nThere's all kinds of areas that when you are 5-0, you're doing more things better than poorly. You better pay attention to what you are doing poorly though.\nTaylor Bertolet...\nSumlin: He's gotten better. You have to have a certain amount of confidence in people and I guess what we see is different from what yall see. It is easier to make those types of decisions when you are around people seven days a week it's a lot different than three and a half hours on a Saturday.\nTo watch the entire press conference, click here\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/at4EWLKADCg?t=825", "https://youtu.be/at4EWLKADCg?t=1195", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/06/former-nfl-safety-brian-dawkins-spends-time-texas-football-team-watch-hype-speech", "https://youtu.be/at4EWLKADCg?t=911", "https://youtu.be/at4EWLKADCg", "https://youtu.be/at4EWLKADCg?t=344", "https://youtu.be/at4EWLKADCg?t=541", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "https://youtu.be/at4EWLKADCg?t=6", "https://youtu.be/at4EWLKADCg?t=87"], "published": "2015-10-07T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:03:50.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
