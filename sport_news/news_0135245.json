Pleasant News \nThe Iowa Wesleyan volleyball team put up a good fight against a tough Clarke University team on Wednesday night. The Tigers kept it close in two out of three sets, falling 3-0 (25-21, 25-19, 25 13) just one day after picking up their third victory of the year by defeating Knox College in five sets (25-23, 23-25, 25-22, 19-25, 18-16). \nThe Tigers showed a lot of heart in their Wednesday win to pick up a victory in their closest game this season. IW and Knox went back and forth in sets and it took extra serves in set five to get the 18-16 victory. \nWenesday’s win was in large part due to a huge game out of hitter Lexa Mahr who tallied an impressive 17 kills in 50 attempts to lead the team. Allegra Collette and Sydney Ellsworth also had big games hitting, finishing with eight and six kills respectively. \nMahr also led the team in assists, with 17 and was second in digs, with 19 in the win. Cierra Howard had a big game defensively with 34 digs, and Maggie Earney had an all around good game with 13 assists and 11 digs. \nThe Tigers came in to Thursday night’s game 11 games under .500 and facing a Clarke team that was 10 games over .500. IW didn’t look intimidated though, and put up a close fight in the first two sets, falling 25-21 and 25-19, before the Crusaders were able to pull away in the third set, winning 25-13. \nIW’s kills were more spread out in Thursday’s game. Cassandra Schwamborn led the team with eight kills on 26 attempts, and Mahr had 7 kills on 26 attempts of her own. Collette, Howard and Jordan Miller each had four kills, Kara Gillis had three, Ellsworth had two and Earney had one. \nHoward led in digs again with 20. Schwamborn and Mahr each finished with nine digs. Mahr also had the most assists, with 15. Early was second in assists, with eight. \nWesleyan fell to 3-15 with the loss and will have two chances on Saturday, Oct. 10 to pick up a win. The Tigers will host Greenville College at 10 a.m. and Blackburn College at 4 p.m. In their previous game against Blackburn, the Tigers picked up their first conference win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:05:21.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
