Attorney general spokeswoman Sara Rabern said charges against Michael London will be dismissed. The 67-year-old London died Friday at a hospice in Sioux Falls. The cause of death was not immediately available. \nPrevious Story: Charges Filed Following Brule County Standoff London was arrested in January after his son, Donald London, allegedly shot and wounded Patrol Sgt. John Koenig, who has since recovered. Michael London was released from prison in August on a personal recognizance bond after a judge determined he was not a flight risk because of several reasons, including poor health. Donald London has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges including attempted murder. His trial has not been scheduled. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
