Emily Bland once again keyed a strong defensive effort in front of the cage.” The Blue Devils (8-6-1) held a 7-2 advantage in shots and a 7-3 edge in corners. Mackenzie Oberholzer registered two saves to preserve the shutout. Following Tuesday’s win, G-A sits 16th in the current District 3-AA power ratings used to determined postseason qualifiers. The top-20 will advance. The Blue Devils return to action Thursday at home against Boiling Springs before heading to Big Spring for a make-up game on Saturday. BOYS’ SOCCER G-A falls to Camp Hill in final seconds CAMP HILL — In a showdown of two emerging contenders, Camp Hill scored the game-winning goal with 30 seconds remaining in regulation Tuesday night, defeating Greencastle-Antrim 2-1. Seemingly headed for overtime, Adam Jones found the back of the net for the Lions, snapping G-A’s four game winning streak. Austyn Smith opened the scoring for the Blue Devils (13-4) less than three minutes in before Camp Hill immediately answered, tying the game at the 4:29 mark of the first half. The back-and-forth contest unfolded from there, culminating in Jones’ game-winner for Camp Hill, which improved to 14-1 on the year. “We scored early and tried to take the momentum right away, but then we gave one up two minutes later, which hurt,” G-A coach Scott Gelsinger said. “Then to give up the game-winner with 30 seconds left is tough. They’re a very good team that found a way to get it done.” Still comfortably in position to qualify for the District 3 playoffs, Greencastle concludes its regular season schedule at Carlisle on Saturday. GIRLS’ VOLLEYBALL Blue Devils sweep Boiling Springs BOILING SPRINGS — Greencastle-Antrim cruised to a Mid-Penn Capital Division sweep of Boiling Springs Tuesday night, earning wins of 25-17, 25-15 and 25-14.
