The finals for both are scheduled for Oct. 31. \nThe defensive statistics for coach Bethany Coursen's field hockey team are pretty scary. Goalies Emma Lober and Brigid Hodsden combined for 11 shutouts and the Terriers allowed just five goals all season, thanks to a talented back line of Emily Stoddard, Murphy Hicks and Paxton Santorelli. \nTop-seeded Bellows Falls (10-2-2) will host No. 8 Montpelier (0-11-3) on Friday at 3:45 p.m. In the other Division 3 quarterfinal matchups, No. 2 Stowe (11-3-0) will welcome No. 7 Saint Johnsbury (1-9-3), No. 6 North Country (3-9-2) will visit third-ranked Lyndon (4-5-5), and No. 5 Milton (1-6-6) will play at No. 4 Missisquoi Valley (4-7-3). \nCoach Buddy Hayford, who has a state record 375 soccer victories, has an offense that's pretty sweet. \nNick Nilsen leads the Wildcats with 10 goals and six assists. And Justin Hicks is next on the list with eight winners and four dimes. \nThe two-time defending state champion Twin Valley (12-1-1) will host No. 16 Oxbow in today's D-3 playdown game at 3 p.m. Winooski (11-3-0), Stowe (8-4-2) and Williamstown (11-3-0) round out the top four seeds. Advertisement \nFifth-ranked Leland & Gray (9-5-0) will welcome No. 12 Randolph (3-8-3) in today's playdown at 3 p.m. The Rebels have to be envisioning a rematch with Twin Valley in the semis, which would come a little over a month after Bryce Karg tallied twice to snap TV's streak of 39 consecutive victories and 28 in a row at home. \nFive other area teams will go on the road for a playdown game today: \n*The No. 14 Brattleboro boys soccer team (4-9-1) and freshman phenom Jeremy Rounds will attempt to upset No. 3 Rice (12-2-0) in a 3 p.m. contest. \n*The No. 15 Brattleboro girls soccer team (4-10-0), which got eight saves from netminder Megyn Ayotte versus rival MAU on Friday, will be looking to put an end to its eight-game skid when playing at No. 2 Colchester (14-0-0) at 3 p.m. \n*After getting a hat trick from Ashley Bates in their regular-season finale, the 12th-seeded Leland & Gray girls soccer team (5-8-1) will play at No. 5 Green Mountain (9-4-1) at 3 p.m. \n*The No. 16 Twin Valley girls soccer team (4-10-1), which got two goals and an assist from Caitlin Hunt in a recent victory over Bellows Falls, will look to play giant killer at top-seeded BFA Fairfax (10-2-2) at 3 p.m. \n*The 11th-seeded Brattleboro field hockey team (3-9-2) will play at No. 6 Hartford (6-4-4) at 3:45 p.m. The Colonels got goals from Kharisma Boyd and Laura Freeman, an assist from Kylee Shatrau, and a shutout by goalie Olivia Weeks, in a must-win game versus Fair Haven on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:23:09.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
