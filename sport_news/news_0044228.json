Down one, Dyck had to draw the four foot with his last rock to force an extra end, however he came up light and handed Rae Hainstock’s team a 6-4 victory. \nThe defending champs aren’t back this year with three of them not returning to the league and Hainstock teaming up with Murray Warren. Dyck would love to get the crown and he begins his quest Wednesday afternoon when the 28-team league begins at the Brandon and Riverview curling clubs. \n\"We always hope we can do better,\" he said. \"We did pretty good last year but I think it’s going to be hard to do that again. There are no easy teams out there. Every game is a tough one.\" \nThis will be Dyck’s third year in the league. He went 7-6 and missed the playoffs in his debut two winters ago before going 9-4 last season and topping Al Smalley in last year’s semifinals. \nDyck didn’t try for masters provincials last year. The thought is in the back of his mind for this season, but he hasn’t talked to his teammates about pursuing that goal. \nInstead, he’s just going to have fun in the Super League this season, which is for players 60 and over. \n\"It’s a very competitive league and the guys are great to curl against, so I think that means a lot,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, the Steam ‘N’ Wood Curlettes also begins play on Wednesday morning at the Brandon Curling Club. \nJean Garbolinsky is back with Heather Lewis and Wilma Jones to defend their title. They have a new lead in Joan Tegg as Diane Sadler, who’s played with Garbolinsky for the last 15 years, was unable to come back for another season due to medical reasons. \nGarbolinsky went 5-1 and tied Lois Fowler for first place in the standings last year. She then beat Fowler’s team, which was without its skip who was sick, 6-3 in the final. \nFowler isn’t back this year after deciding to retire from the sport after winning a world senior women’s title last season, but Garbolinsky expects a lot of competition. The league has expanded to eight teams with Fowler’s former third Maureen Bonar entering a new team as well as Terry Ursel. \n\"That is great,\" Garbolinsky said. \"I’m really happy to see them coming in. There’s been a changeover and there’s some younger teams coming back into it now and that’s good.\" \nThe Curlettes will be the only competitive event Garbolinsky enters this season. She has decided to go south after Christmas and won’t compete in any event in which a provincial berth is awarded. \nShe’s looking forward to the beginning of the season, although she will have to make up her first game against Karen Dunbar as all four members of Garbolinsky’s team are heavily involved in the upcoming federal election. \n\"It will be good. It will be fun,\" she said. \"We do like to play Curlettes because we do feel like we’re competitive. It’s a lot of fun and we’ve made good friendships and that’s why we do it. We enjoy everybody there.\" \nEXTRA ENDS: Fowler, Bonar, Cathy Gauthier and Allyson Stewart, as well as coach Brian Fowler, were presented with their world championship banner at the Brandon club yesterday.
