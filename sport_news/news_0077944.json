That's all it takes. There's no other way. We can't read into this result anymore. It's over - disappointing as it was. We got to move forward.\"\nOlympic qualifying is limited to under-23 teams, and the Americans were eliminated four years ago in the group stage. Senior national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann said failing to reach the London Olympics set back the careers of players in that age group, which included Brek Shea, Mix Diskerud and Bill Hamid.\nNow another age group could miss out on the Olympics. Among the American starters were New York Red Bulls defender Matt Miazga, Tottenham under-21 defender Cameron Carter-Vickers, Fulham midfielder Emerson Hyndman, Real Salt Lake midfielder Luis Gil and Stanford forward Jordan Morris, who already has scored for the U.S. senior national team.\n\"We were not able to deal with the situation today,\" U.S. coach Andi Herzog said. \"It's sad, but it's the truth.\"\nElis put the Hondurans ahead when he chested a pass from Kevin Alvarez and lobbed the ball over two defenders and inside a post of goalkeeper Ethan Horvath.\nThe U.S. had just two shots on goal in each half. The best chance was in the 63rd, minute, when goalkeeper Luis Lopez made a diving one-handed deflection on Carter-Vickers' header off a corner kick.\nElis doubled the lead when he flicked the ball inside the far post following Kevin Lopez's cross.\n\"We had our plan, but we weren't able to do it in the right way,\" Herzog said. \"That's the most disappointing thing.\"\nAs the Americans pressed for a goal, Trapp, Fatai Alashe and Jerome Kiesewetter were given yellow cards from the 75th minute on.\n\"It's an emotional game with a lot on the line,\" Trapp said. \"They managed the game pretty well. Can't fault them for that.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
