The game, which was supposed to be played Friday night at Stang, was pushed back a day and moved to Cressy Field at UMass Dartmouth because of inclement weather. The action started slow, as both teams looked a bit thrown off by the extra day of rest. In the first quarter, the two teams combined for just 42 yards, two punts and one turnover on downs, as both failed to move the ball effectively. Late in the second quarter, however, the Spartan offense, led by the backfield duo of brothers Will and Nick Landry, got things going. With just under two minutes left on the clock Will, the team’s quarterback, scampered into the end zone from 27 yards out to break the scoreless tie and finish a 59-yard drive started off nicely by a few big runs by his brother. “I think it definitely helps,” Will said about sharing the back field with his brother. “We’ve been playing for 10 years since Pop Warner. I’ve been the quarterback, he’s been the running back.” Fairhaven countered early in the second half, after forcing a fumble on the Spartans’ first series of the third quarter. Running back Noah Furtado punched the ball in from three yards out with 5:35 left on the clock and turned the tables as Stang’s lead was cut to 7-6. After shutting down Stang’s offense again, the Blue Devils looked poised to take the lead until quarterback Ian Furtado’s pass was intercepted by Spartans senior captain Jeff Chicca, who set his team up with prime field passion. From there, Nick Landry did his best impersonation of his brother with his own 27-yard scamper, which effectively stuck a fork in the Fairhaven attack. Stang scored two more times, both early in the fourth, including a second score for Nick Landry and a 67-yard sprint to the end zone for Chicca, who finished the day with 74 yards on just four carries. “They definitely tried to key the fullback in our offense,” Nick Landry said, explaining how the backfield broke the game open late. “We had their (defensive) line, linebackers crashing down hard toward the middle of the field. Our offensive line handled blocks which let our backs kind of bounce it outside. So we just started bouncing it outside a little bit cause everyone started crashing in and that kind of opened it up. On the other end of the field, Fairhaven looked overmatched all night as their own brother duo, the Furtados, struggled to get space to work with as the Spartan defense stuffed the run and continually clogged the passing lanes. WHAT\"S NEXT: Stang moves to 3-1 on the season with the win. They’ll look for their first league win this week with a homecoming game against Martha’s Vinyard on Friday. The loss dropped the Blue Devils to 2-2 on the season, as they open up league play next week against GNB Voc-Tech. KEY PLAY: The game’s key play was undoubtedly Chicca’s interception of Furtado late in the third quarter. Fairhaven had just cut to within a point and had the momentum on their side after two nice defensive stands. After the pick, Landry took the next play to the house, and that was all she wrote for the Blue Devils. SOUTHCOASTVARSITY.COM MVP: This honor goes to two guys tonight; Nick Landry and Chicca. Landry led the charge for the team’s second half outburst and put two of the team’s four scores on the board, while rushing for 83 yards on 13 carries. Chicca had fewer plays to make an impact, but his interception was a game changer and a 67-yard TD run never looks bad on film. STRONG INTERIOR PLAY: Junior defensive tackle Malik Perry was a key part of the Spartans’ dominance on defense. The 5-foot-9, 241-pounder created havoc in the backfield all night long and racked up three sacks in the second half to help put the game on ice. TOUGH DAY: Ian Furtado had a tough day passing the ball for the Blue Devils offense. A lack of blocks and a couple of costly drops cost the senior quarterback and his team some big time scoring chances. On the night, Furtado was just 7-18 for only 49 yards and an interception.
