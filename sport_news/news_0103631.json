Going into the final day, the Karnataka batsmen faced the challenging task of scoring at a rapid pace in their second essay to post a strong target and give their bowlers a chance to go hard at the rivals. However, the slow nature of the pitch combined with Vidarbha’s defensive bowling strategy spoilt the hosts’ plans.Resuming from their overnight score of 93 for one, with an overall lead of 133, Karnataka batted two complete sessions, largely on the back of fluent unbeaten centuries from Karun Nair (101 n.o.) and R Samarth (121 n.o), to declare at 331 for three and set a target of 372 for the visitors. With a result looking highly improbable, both the captains agreed to share honours with one hour of play remaining. Vidarbha were 17 for no loss when the match ended.Earlier, the hosts were expected to go after the Vidarbha bowling in order to push for their first victory of the season. But their top-order batsmen adopted a risk-free approach and made sure they take home the three points for their first innings lead.“We definitely thought of an outright win at the start of the day but as the first session progressed, the ball was not easily coming onto the bat and we realised it was not easy to attack. Hence we decided to bat and score as much as possible and take home three points rather than take too many risks and lose wickets in clusters,” said Karnataka pacer S Arvind.Despite the match not producing a result in favour of Karnataka, nothing can be taken away from the knocks of Samarth and Nair. After opener KL Rahul departed on the third ball of the day, Samarth and Manish Pandey scripted a 58-run stand to prevent any further hiccups. Samarth’s solid technique, especially against the pace bowlers and excellent composure, helped him construct a patient innings.Consistently keeping an outside-off stump attack to a 6-3 off-side field, Vidarbha bowlers never looked like going for wickets. Cramped for runs in their initial phase of their innings, Nair and Samarth punished the odd loose ball and rotated the strike with some sharp singles.Once they settled down, the duo drove the overpitched deliveries delightfully and used their feet to perfection against Vidarbha’s lone specialist spinner Akshay Wakhare. Samarth, who missed out to a loose shot in the first innings, slammed 12 fours en route his second ton of the season.Nair, who was highly cautious in the initial phase, switched gears once he went past his half-century. Latching on to the short-pitched balls, the right-hander scored most of his runs in the second part of his knock in boundaries. With the team management deciding not to declare anytime before tea, Nair had the liberty to aim for a century and he reached the milestone with a four. The duo remained unbroken in their stand of 176 runs. Karnataka, with seven points to their credit from three matches, are placed fourth in their group and they next face Haryana in Mysuru from October 22.
