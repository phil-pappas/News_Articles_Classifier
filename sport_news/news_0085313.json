If we put in a performance like the one against Arsenal, we can get a positive result.\"\nBayern have won all eight of their matches since losing the pre-season German Super Cup final at Wolfsburg on penalties and are targeting a fifth consecutive semi-final appearance in the Champions League.\n\"If we put in our usual performance, we'll take the three points,\" said captain Philipp Lahm ahead of the Zagreb clash.\nTheir Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is in amazing form with seven goals in just two games including his historic five-goal haul in nine minutes last Tuesday, when Wolfsburg were routed 5-1 at the Allianz Arena, plus two more in Saturday's 3-0 win at Mainz.\nBayern have two big matches this week as they host German rivals Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga on Sunday and their goal is clear.\n\"The points have to remain in Munich,\" said Lewandowski, referring to both matches.\nHaving scored his 100th and 101st German league goals against Mainz, the Poland hot-shot wants to extent his purple patch against the Croatian league and cup champions.\n\"It's just incredible. He succeeds at everything he does at the moment. Of course we're happy to make the most of it,\" said Lahm as Lewandowski became the fastest foreigner into the Bundesliga's exclusive club.\nCertainly, Lewandowski's purple patch even drew a rare joke out of Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer amidst talk of a 'goal-scoring crisis' after the Poland striker 'only' scored twice in Mainz following his five goals.\n\"He only scored two goals. But we'll turn a blind eye to that,\" quipped Sammer.\nDinamo's Croatia international Josip Pivaric will be one of the defenders handed the unenviable task of making sure Lewandowski has a quiet night in Munich.\n\"We'll do everything we can to surprise and confuse them,\" said the Croatia international.\n\"We need to play the match first and then talk about who is the better team.\n\"Of course, they are one of the best teams in the world, but I hope Tuesday will be a great day for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:29:15.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
