Also appearing onstage? Dozens of children who stuttered.\n\"These kids just blow you away,\" Caporale said. \"For me, growing up with no confidence in my voice, to see these kids up in front of a group of hundreds of people — acting, singing, totally confident in themselves — I was hooked.\"\nThe group, which has since changed its name to SAY: The Stuttering Association for the Young , hosts a sleep-away camp every summer in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Caporale decided to raise money for the camp by riding his bike from his home in Chicago's Hyde Park to the camp, 720 miles away.\n\"I felt like it was a way to show these kids, if you put your mind and heart into something, the sky's the limit,\" he said. \"I want them to know they don't have to put a ceiling on themselves.\"\nHe's made the ride for the last three summers — with a group the first time, alone the second two. He rides 60 miles a day for 12 days straight, bunking down in motels along the way.\nTaro Alexander, SAY's founder and president, says Caporale is \"legendary\" at camp.\n\"The kids line up on two sides chanting, 'Go, Corey, go! Go, Corey go!'\" Alexander said. \"He rides in like a superhero, and he tells them his story and why he's there and what he just went through.\"\nAlexander remembers Caporale approaching him shortly after that 2011 gala and floating the bike ride by him.\n\"I was like, 'You want to do what?'\" Alexander said. \"He told me, 'I want these kids to know that somebody out there supports them and cares about them so much that they'd ride 720 miles for them.'\"\nCaporale's ride, through online fundraising , raises money for the camp's scholarship program.\nCamp SAY is a two-week program for kids ages 8-18. This past summer 124 campers rode horses and swam, played sports and made art — all sorts of traditional camp things. Many told Alexander they never wanted to leave.\n\"Sometimes it happens as fast as sitting on the bus from the airport to camp and hearing each other stutter and, boom, these kids are friends for life,\" Alexander said. \"Seeing a child go from very afraid to even open their mouth and by the end of camp saying how proud they are of their voice and their friends, it's real, life-transformational stuff happening.\"\nCaporale grew up the middle child — between an older sister and a younger sister — in a small Ohio farm town. He now has two daughters, 5 and 7 (he's divorced from their mom), and a career at Madison Dearborn Partners, where he works as a document production specialist.\nI asked him how different his life would have been had he been exposed to a group like SAY as a kid.\n\"A huge difference,\" he said. \"Huge.\"\n\"I never heard, 'It's OK to stutter,'\" he said. \"These kids at 8 are learning things that I'm just now learning at 37: courage, taking chances, how important it is to have a voice and communicate in a confident way.\"\nStuttering affects about 1 percent of the global population and 5 percent of all children, according to SAY. Boys are more than twice as likely to stutter as girls, and no single cause has been confirmed, though researchers have indicated that genetics can contribute. Despite conventional wisdom, SAY maintains, stuttering is generally not caused by psychological or physical trauma.\nSo solving it remains a bit of a mystery. SAY's approach, which measures success not in stutter-free fluency, but in a child's willingness and confidence to speak up despite a stutter, has gained traction in the last few decades.\n\"The mission of SAY is to empower young people who stutter to know they can do anything they want in life and to not let stuttering hold them back from anything,\" Alexander said. \"We're here to improve their confidence and communication skills and to help them create friendships and to educate them about what stuttering is and what it is not, as well as support their support system — their parents, their teachers, their speech pathologists — so we're not just empowering these kids and giving them all these tools to go into a world where no one else is on the same page.\"\nMedical experts don't all agree.\n\"The field is not united on this,\" Alexander said.\n\"There are many, many speech pathologists and organizations that are dedicated to helping people who stutter who are 100 percent in line with the thinking that fluency is not the goal,\" he said. \"But a lot of speech pathologists do think fluency is the be-all, end-all, and if you can get the child to be fluent, they won't have the feelings of shame and isolation.\"\nSAY works with children to set and meet specific goals for their voices, Alexander said.\n\"Maybe somebody is really afraid to talk on the phone,\" he said. \"They're afraid of getting laughed at or hung up on. So we'll work toward calling a pizza place to ask how long they're open.\"\nOften, he said, the kindness of strangers astounds them. Other times it does not. SAY gives children tools for both outcomes.\n\"I have three children,\" Alexander said. \"I totally understand; if there are any challenges, your first instinct is to want to make it better. Talking is such a core part of who we are, and it's devastating to see a child not be able to get their words out.\"\nSometimes simply finding a community can be powerfully therapeutic.\n\"Both for the child and the parent, being around kids who talk in the same way can help you see, 'I don't need to hate the way I speak,'\" he said. \"We want to get people to a place of self-acceptance and knowing what they have to say matters. Even if it takes you a little longer to say it, shouldn't that be OK?\"\nCaporale said he was inspired by the gala to begin his own journey toward self-acceptance.\n\"I looked up the word 'stutter' in the dictionary,\" he told me. \"So there it is. And the word on top of it is 'style.'\n\"So the way that I saw that was, in a way, stuttering is a stylish way of speaking,\" he said. \"I would hope that's the way it's viewed going forward — as a part of who you are, rather than something in a list of medical terms. A dysfunction.\"\nNow he views his stutter as a gift.\n\"When I was younger, I hated the fact that I always felt vulnerable because of my speech,\" he said. \"As I grew up, I sort of learned that vulnerability puts people at ease. It lends a certain comfort level to the conversation.\n\"It's almost been a filter to me to find people with hearts of gold,\" he continued. \"Shallow people don't get it, so they sort of filter away.\"\nIn a 2014 blog post, Caporale wrote about accepting his stutter as an ally.\n\"My stutter is honest, brutally honest,\" he wrote. \"Every day it reminds me that I am imperfect.\"\nBut to hundreds of kids, he's a superhero.\nhstevens@tribpub.com\nTwitter @heidistevens13\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Medical Research", "external_links": ["http://www.crowdrise.com/bikehike720", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56154de3/turbine/ct-balancing-act-sun-1011-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:40:29.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
