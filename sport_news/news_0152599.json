He tells North Side faithful not to get their hopes up too much because baseball history dictates it's not going to happen.\nWith 97 wins under their belt, Cubs confident heading to Pittsburgh Mark Gonzales The only regret the Cubs expressed after completing their 97-victory season with an eight-game winning streak was not being able to play Wednesday night's National League wild-card game at Wrigley Field.\n\"How could you possibly be disappointed with anything the players have done?\" manager Joe...\nThe only regret the Cubs expressed after completing their 97-victory season with an eight-game winning streak was not being able to play Wednesday night's National League wild-card game at Wrigley Field.\n\"How could you possibly be disappointed with anything the players have done?\" manager Joe...\n(Mark Gonzales) As with any couple facing ups and downs, someone or something often is held responsible for problems that arise.\n\"You can't blame an entire baseball series on the curse; you can't blame your failures on it either,\" Stenzel said.\nHe said he hopes, for the sake of the fans, that if the Cubs do exit the playoffs, that the exit comes earlier rather than later.\n\"The longer it goes, the harder the loss will seem,\" he added.\nStenzel said if the Cubs manage to win it all, the entire Cubs culture of losing will radically change. \"It would be nice to see them win, just for the Cub fans that have endured the team every year,\" he said.\nThe Cubs have not been in the playoffs since 2008 and last won a postseason game in 2003. And as for winning the World Series? The team hasn't done that since 1908.\nAdam Russo suggest Cubs fans \"hope for the best and prepare for the worst.\"\nAs a licensed clinical social worker and CEO of Edgewood Clinical Services in Naperville, Russo said so much more than luck goes into winning the one-game wild card play-in, five-game division series and seven-game champion series before a team even makes it to the World Series. \"There's a lot of things that have to go right. That's a lot of games,\" Russo said. \"It takes the right synergy.\"\nNo wrong way for Cubs fans to feel about wild-card game Paul Sullivan One of the great debates on sports talk radio Friday afternoon was how Cubs fans should behave heading into Wednesday night's wild-card game against the Pirates at PNC Park.\nShould you be cautiously optimistic and prepare for the worst, dulling the pain if the Cubs happen to lose?\nOr should you...\nOne of the great debates on sports talk radio Friday afternoon was how Cubs fans should behave heading into Wednesday night's wild-card game against the Pirates at PNC Park.\nShould you be cautiously optimistic and prepare for the worst, dulling the pain if the Cubs happen to lose?\nOr should you...\n(Paul Sullivan) As a New York Yankees fan, Russo understands it takes more than money or magic to create a winning team. \"You need to get smart people making smart decisions because the magic can go only so far,\" he said, adding that so far the Cubs appear to have that formula down. The Yankees, absent from the postseason since 2012, clinched a wild card berth Thursday.\nAs far as the Cubs being cursed to lose, Russo said \"positive mojo outweighs the Billy Goat curse.\"\nMeanwhile, Dr. M. Joann Wright, director of clinical training and anxiety services at Linden Oaks in Naperville, takes a different approach to the sports anxiety; she urges fans to embrace it, even if it means eating a less-than-healthy ballpark hot dog.\nWright said not all types of stress are bad. Eustress is what people experience planning a wedding, riding a roller coaster, seeing a scary movie, or watching a sporting event.\nShe said eustress gives people the chance to enjoy the experience of anticipation and excitement that is involved in a baseball game. \"It's good to have those butterflies,\" Wright said. \"Cubs fans should embrace and enjoy the game, just go with it.\"\nFriendly rivalries also should be embraced, Wright said.\nAlthough Wright also grew up a Yankees fan, when her Cardinals-fan sister from St. Louis came to town, Wright says she donned Cubbie blue when the two attended a game at Wrigley Field. \"She got to rub it in, but it was all in good fun,\" she said.\nSuch advice offers little solace for the average Cubs fan who has waited for the 107-year championship drought to end. Cubs fan Elic Bramlett of Naperville is taking his dreams for the postseason day-by-day.\nBramlett, who is known to wake his sleeping children through the occasional outburst while watching the Cubs, plans to camp out Wednesday where he has been all season — in front of his television. \"I can't go to viewing parties or public places. I have to watch (games) alone,\" he said.\nDuring the regular season, Bramlett often recorded games and eschewed all forms of communications so he could watch games after his kids went to bed. \"I like to be able to fast forward through the commercials,\" Bramlett said.\nHe added no amount of eliminating social media or phone calls can prevent spoilers. During the Chicago Blackhawks quest for the Stanley Cup, Bramlett was forced to watch the games live since people in the neighborhood would shoot off celebratory fireworks whenever the Blackhawks scored a goal.\nWednesday's game has a lot riding on it in the family dynamic; Bramlett's in-laws are all from Pittsburgh. \"My wife's entire family are Pirates fans. She was converted to the Cubs years ago,\" he added.\nBramlett grew up a Cubs fan while living in Phoenix because the Diamondbacks didn't exist yet and he could watch the Cubs on WGN. \"I'd come home from school and turn on the game,\" he said. \"Wrigley Field was a big deal to me; it was mecca.\"\nWhen he moved to Chicago as an adult 20 years ago, he said he knew he had to be near Wrigley Field. It was because he lived near Wrigleyville that he happened upon a line forming at the ticket box one night and he was able to snag tickets to the 1998 National League wild-card tie-breaker game against the San Francisco Giants. The emotional roller coaster of winning the wild card game and then being swept by the Atlanta Braves keeps Bramlett grounded.\n\"You have to be a realist when you sign on to be a Cubs fan,\" Bramlett said \"You may never ever see a World Series.\"\nBramlett's brother, Eric, also of Naperville, said going into the season, most Cubs fans accepted 2015 as a rebuilding year. \"Seeing them in the postseason is a free gift. It's like we got one for free,\" Eric Bramlett said.\nThe brothers will remain loyal, no matter the outcome. \"We're still fans. I'm not going to drop them for another team,\" Elic Bramlett said.\nsubaker@tribpub.com\nCopyright © 2015, Naperville Sun Chicago Cubs World Series Wrigley Field New York Yankees St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Blackhawks Pittsburgh Pirates", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612c007/turbine/ct-nvs-naperville-cubs-playoffs-st-1004-20151005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127e49/turbine/ct-report-cubs-brewers-spt-1005-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56126ead/turbine/ct-sullivan-cubs-wild-card-spt-1005-20151004-thumbnail"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:53:12.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
