A massive game? \n\"No bigger than any other. They're all important,\" Hynes said Saturday. \"There's a rivalry. Obviously Madison Square Garden is a historic place to be able to play in and the Devils-Rangers rivalry is something we're all aware of. From that standpoint, for sure. But they all count the same.\" \nPerhaps. Some games just carry a little more weight, even though it's very early in the season. Particularly because the Devils have yet to win a game, or even have a lead this season. \n\"Going into their building against the Rangers it would be real fun to get our first win there,\" goalie Cory Schneider said. \"It's going to be a challenge, though, a good test. They're obviously a real good team and they play well at home, so we're going to have fro get off to a good start and hopefully carry over some of the things we did last night.\" RELATED: Why the Devils will stay in a New York hotel \nIf they score the first goal, it will be for the first time this season. \n\"For me, this game is always up there. There is always that little extra on the line,\" Adam Henrique said. \nThis season the Devils are predicted to struggle and probably miss the playoffs. And the Rangers are said to be loaded, taking another run at winning the Stanley Cup. \nIs the gap between the two teams that wide? \n\"I don't think so,\" winger Kyle Palmieri said. \"Those projections are built off what the teams did last year. We haven't gotten off to the start we wanted to, but there are still 78 games left. The season hasn't been formed yet. There is a lot of opportunity for us to turn things around here. We took a couple steps last night, but it's not good enough to just get a point.\"You can say all you want about how good they are and what kind of success they've had. When it comes down to it, it's the National Hockey League and everyone is here for a reason. We're going to go in there tomorrow with a chance to win.\" \nTravis Zajac agreed. \n\"I think teams are too close,\" Zajac said. \"It comes down to execution, confidence and other intangibles. The league is close. I don't think you're ever out of a game. It's little details that eventually separate good teams from the bottom.\" \nThe Devils are 0-3-1. The Rangers are 3-2-0. \n\"We're not about moral victories at all here, but we've had a tough start to the season,\" Schneider noted. \"We played four playoff teams from last year, a couple of the better teams in the West. We haven't played our best and we were right there with every one of them. The results aren't there and that's what matters, but we haven't played our best yet. If we finally get a real consistent effort and do it night in and night out, it's up to us to change that perception and I think we can do it.\" \nSchneider isn't downplaying the game. \n\"This will be a real good game for us to get that first win and maybe raise the emotion level a little bit. Sometimes you need those turning point games and a rival brings out the best in you,\" the goalie said. \"We have enough guys here who've played in this rivalry long enough to know what it means. To get a win on their ice, the first one of the year for us, would be really important.\" \nRich Chere may be reached at rchere@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @Ledger_NJDevils .
