LOUIS (AP) — A Missouri judge has continued until next month the criminal case against New York Jets defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson, accused of resisting arrest and traffic counts for a summer police chase in suburban St. Louis. \nA court hearing was cancelled Monday. Richardson was not there. St. Charles County Associate Circuit Judge Norman Steimel III continued the case until Nov. 9. \nRichardson sat out the first four games this season as part of a suspension for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. \nThe former University of Missouri star lives in O’Fallon, Missouri, in the offseason. He was arrested July 14 after allegedly driving his 2014 Bentley up to 143 mph with a 12-year-old relative in the car. \nOfficers allegedly found a loaded handgun under a floor mat and detected a marijuana odor.
