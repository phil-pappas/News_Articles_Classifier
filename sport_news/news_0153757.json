The Blue Devils see a hill, and a tough one at that, every day. \n\"We've got that big one going up to the school,\" junior Connor Meehan said. \"That's a little tradition. We [run it] after every practice.\" \nSo, when Meehan's charge back to the front of the pack at Wahconah Regional High School involved a few uphill runs Wednesday, it wasn't as much of a chore for him. Advertisement \nMeehan charged out in front to start the race, fell back behind Lenox's Raphael Bruno, and then caught him and pulled away for the individual victory Wednesday in 16 minutes, 15 seconds. Lenox's Emma Jourdain led the usual Millionaire pack in winning the girls race in 18:32. \nWith four boys in the top 10, Monument Mountain earned a pair of dual wins, beating Wahconah 21-34 and Lee 20-39. Lenox, with three boys in the top 10 (led by Bruno in second), held off Wahconah 28-29 and Lee 23-36. Wahconah beat Drury 20-43. \nOn the girls side, Lenox runners took five of the top 10 spots and won duals over Wahconah (36-44) and Lee (15-50). Monument Mountain used its three runners in the top 10 to lead it past Wahconah (27-30) and Lee (15-50), while Wahconah — led by freshman standouts Gabrielle and Danielle Orlando in fifth and sixth, respectively — beat Drury 17-46. \nBOYS RACE \nMeehan wasted no time establishing an early lead along the flat first mile of the Wahconah course. Bruno, though, would catch him and establish a lead in the second mile when Meehan said he \"slowed down a lot.\" \n\"I knew I had some work cut out for me,\" Meehan continued. \"That final mile, I was telling myself that I've got to go and make my move, and once I do, I've got to stick with it.\" \nHe made his move, and by the time the Drury junior crossed the finish line, he was 14 seconds ahead of Bruno and the rest of the field. Lee's Sam Harding was third in 17:21, followed by Wahconah's Jaryd Massaro and Lenox's Connor McNinch to round out the top five. \nHarding said that a steady start — something he said he tries to get younger Lee runners to embrace — helped him pick off runners in front of him on hills. \n\"I started out a little slower than I would have liked, but I had raced a bunch of these guys before, so I knew ... I would eventually get up there if I pushed myself,\" Harding, a senior, said. \nMonument's strength came in pack running, as its top four finishers — Richard Stanmeyer, Jared Henry, Brendan Kavanah and Nick Gray — finished in seventh through 10th places, respectively, and all within 11 seconds of one another. \nGIRLS RACE \nJourdain said that, despite a wave of illness hitting the Lenox team this week, she was able to fight through some mild congestion and run the race she wanted to run. \nJourdain and teammate Emily Tibbetts, the defending Western Mass. Division II individual champion, were side-by-side for much of the course before Tibbetts pulled away and teammate Maggie Sorrentino took over second place. Tibbetts was third, with Alice Najimy fourth. \n\"It really helped to have Emily there pushing along with me,\" Jourdain said. \"It felt good to run strong with her for a while. \n\"It ended up working fine. I knew the faster I ran, the quicker I'd be done.\" \nGabrielle was the first Orlando across the finish line for the host Warriors, in 20:34. Danielle would follow just two seconds later. Warriors coach James McMahon said the home course helped, as his and Matt Pegorari's runners know the trails well. \n\"They also have experience racing outside of the league, so this year wasn't their first year as competitive runners,\" McMahon said. \"I think our seniors have done a great job leading these girls, discussing things like race strategy.\" \nMeryl Phair led the Monument Mountain contingent with a seventh-place finish, followed by Grace Phair, who just caught Lenox's Liz Jarck at the finish. Kayla Dillon finished 10th overall for Monument. \nBefore he saw team scores, Monument girls coach Chris Unsworth was enthusiastic about having three Spartans in the top 10. \n\"Meryl has run great races all year long,\" he said. \"She's worked on her kick and it has really improved. Grace has improved every single race, and Kayla is the rock of the team as far as being there all the time the last four years. They've been in the top 10 to 15 of most races we've had.\" \nJarck's finish gave Lenox, the defending D-II state runner-up, a fifth finisher in the top 10. \n———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:15:47.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
