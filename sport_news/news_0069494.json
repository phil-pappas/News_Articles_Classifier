The incredible reveal for a 14yo boy, only on @fox12oregon . pic.twitter.com/yF8msLXC30\n— Kelsey Watts (@KelseyWattsKPTV) October 24, 2015 It was a labor of love for Jeff Watamura, a volunteer who heard about Magic Wheelchair and wanted to help.\nHe’s an art teacher at El Diamente High School in Visalia, California, and his students spent the last couple of months building it.\nThursday, he made the 12 hour drive to deliver it.\n“It’s always been from day one about Hunter, and the kids know who Hunter is, they’ve seen pictures of him, and now they get to see this and it’s going to be pretty exciting,” Watamura told Fox 12.\nHe can’t count the hours put into designing and building it, but knows every minute was worth it.\n“It’s foam core, I had a freshman who designed it with a 3-D program,” he explained. “We had somebody cut it out professionally, and then we used epoxy resin and fiberglass cloth to coat it so it’s a little harder, and then we just put some windows in it and a fog machine and here we are.”\n“It means a lot… for him to have this, and get all the attention, it’s really cool,” Hunter’s mom, Ginger, added. “I just pictured some little cardboard costume I’ve seen online or something, so this, it blows our mind. It’s way more than we ever thought.”\nOver the next week, the seven other costumes that have been designed and built this year through Magic Wheelchair will be revealed.\nThey’ll be going to kids in Portland, Salem, Banks – and as far away as Georgia.\n“That smile, that’s what it’s all about. The biggest reward and payoff is just see that – that smile,” said Magic Wheelchair founder Ryan Weimer, looking at Hunter’s reaction. “I’ve seen it on my kids’ faces, but now being able to help out other families and other kiddos, it’s super humbling.”\nTo learn more, visit MagicWheelchair.org .\nCopyright 2015 KTPV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
