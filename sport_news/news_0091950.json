According to CSN Bay Area , Kaepernick was called out by a teammate during a players-only meeting.\nThe discussion between Kaepernick and the unnamed teammate got heated, before the two eventually settled their differences a few days later. \nEven if Kaepernick doesn't have the support of everyone in the locker room, he does still have the support of coach Jim Tomsula. \nAfter Kaepernick went 13 of 24 for 124 yards in San Francisco's 20-3 loss to Seattle on Thursday, Tomsula was asked if Kaepernick would remain quarterback. \n\"Yes. Colin is our quarterback. There's no controversies,\" Tomsula said. \nThere's a good chance that Tomsula will be answering that question after every 49ers loss from now until the end of the season. \n\nColin Kaepernick is having some confidence problems.
