Mark Messier, Brian Leetch and Mike Richter are among the players who have signed some of the items \nThe opening bid is a cool $50,000. \nHere's a thought: Crunch owner Howard Dolgon is a life-long Blueshirts fan. \nHow about he coughs up the spare change for the rink, ship it up to Syracuse and set it up in the Oncenter parking lot as an interactive display for the AHL All-Star Classic this season? You could charge a couple bucks per person and let fans play street hockey in it. \nPays for itself. \nIt would be a perfect fit for a couple of reasons. The rink would be the jewel showcase of an event designed to pay tribute to both the AHL's 80th anniversary and hockey history in New York State. \nAnd the Rangers won that Cup the spring before the Crunch arrived in town for the 1994-95 season. In the finals New York beat Vancouver, which was Syracuse's first parent team. \nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:56:21.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
