(AP) - A new trail along a creek where a British army was surrounded after the Battles of Saratoga is being officially opened this weekend.\nOfficials at Saratoga National Historical Park in the town of Stillwater say a ceremony will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday to open the new Saratoga Siege Trail.\nThe half-mile trail along Fish Creek in the village of Victory, eight miles north of the park, is located where British Gen. John Burgoyne's army retreated and found themselves surrounded by American forces after the second Saratoga battle on Oct. 7, 1777. Ten days later, Burgoyne decided to have his starving soldiers lay down their arms.\nMany historians consider the American victory at Saratoga to be the turning point of the Revolutionary War.\nSaturday's ceremony is being held at the historic Schuyler House in Victory.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:14:58.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
