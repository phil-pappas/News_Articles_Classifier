(AP) - With already-saturated soils and flooded roads, East Coast states are bracing for another day of dreary and possibly dangerous weather as forecasters predict more downpours and a possible added punch from powerful Hurricane Joaquin (wah-KEEN').\nTwo storm-related deaths have already occurred in the Carolinas, where heavy rain has fallen for days. Governors up and down the East Coast warned residents to prepare, declaring states of emergency in Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.\nForecasters say a heavy rainstorm parked over the region will pull moisture from an approaching Joaquin and affect the hurricane's course. But even areas that wind up outside of the hurricane's path are in for heavy rains.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
