After Karun Nair (126, 283m, 186b, 18x4) scored his season’s first hundred on Friday, Karnataka saw two more batsmen bring up their centuries to shut Bengal out of the match. Nair got out adding just seven runs to his overnight score, but Shreyas Gopal (139, 365m, 265b, 20x4) and Shishir Bhavane struck their third and maiden first-class hundreds respectively to help Karnataka declare their first innings closed at a mammoth 537/9 in 150.4 overs, giving themselves a handsome lead of 225 runs and enough time to bowl the visitors out for the second time.The hosts, who conceded the lead to Assam in their opener, took a big step towards collecting maximum points from this contest by reducing Bengal to 58/2 before play was called off due to bad light, with nine overs still to be bowled for the day. HS Sharath drew the first blood with his first ball of the day, ending an 11-over resistance from the Bengal openers. J Suchith then bowled Sreevats Goswami – the ball rolling over to hit the stumps after an inside edge – to set off wild celebrations in the middle. The score could well have been 58/3 had umpire Nitin Menon not turned down an LBW appeal in the previous over by Shreyas against Naved Ahmed who was struck flush in front of the stumps.While the pitch isn’t yet doing too many tricks, Bengal, still 167 runs in arrears, will have to bat out of their skins to save this match and salvage a point from what at the moment appears a hopeless situation.Much of the credit for Karnataka extending their dominance will go to the duo of Shreyas and Bhavane. Shreyas, overnight 54, gave another example of his growing prowess as a batsman with an innings that belied his experience. With a judicious mix of caution and aggression, the right-hander kept things under control in the able company of a gutsy Bhavane, who braved a nasty hit on his leading arm that had forced him to retire hurt on Friday.Shreyas scored his first four of the day by steering paceman Ashok Dinda wide of third slip before going on to produce some pleasing strokes on either side of the wicket. He grew in confidence with each passing over as none of the visiting bowlers could make any impact on him, barring to an extent Laxmi Ratan Shukla. Veer Pratap Singh (4/86), managed some reverse swing and dismissed both the centurions but his effort was too little and perhaps came too late in the day. Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha’s debut for Bengal turned out to be a forgettable experience, the once India Test bowler returning poor figures of 41-6-152-1.Shreyas reached his century when he moved from 97 to 101 by flicking Ojha to the fence and continued to torment the attack by bringing up his second highest score. His previous best of 145 too had come against Bengal in Mysuru. He was eventually out after adding 142 runs with Bhavane for the sixth wicket, bettering the split third-wicket stand of 133, by which time Karnataka had taken 172-run lead.Bhavane continued in one gear, neither accelerating nor completely getting into a shell in the hope of a century. The 24-year-old, who batted popping painkillers, completed a well-deserved hundred with a two off Ojha. The innings was as much a tribute to his fortitude as it was about his growing confidence at this level. score board BENGAL (I Innings): 312 all outKARNATAKA (I Innings; O/n: 322/4): R Samarth c Saha b VP Singh 30 (115m, 57b, 4x4), Robin Uthappa b Dinda 3 (15m, 8b), Shishir Bhavane c Saha b VP Singh 119 (368m, 254b, 12x4), Manish Pandey c Goswami b LR Shukla 53 (118m, 80b, 9x4), Karun Nair c Saha b Sarkar 126 (283m, 186b, 18x4), CM Gautam c Goswami b Ojha 15 (35m, 21b, 2x4), Shreyas Gopal lbw VP Singh 139 (365m, 265b, 20x4), Vinay Kumar b Dinda 9 (22m, 12b, 2x4), A Mithun b VP Singh 13 (24m, 13b, 1x6), J Suchith (not out) 8 (18m, 9b), HS Sharath (not out) 0 (3m, 2b).
