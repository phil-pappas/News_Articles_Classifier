Holmes, who was 12th in the standings. \nFuryk withdrew from the BMW Championship because of a deep bone bruise in his left wrist, and he sat out the Tour Championship last week with hopes it would get better. \nAfter rest and treatment, the 45-year-old Furyk did not think he was fit enough to play. \nU.S. captain Jay Haas picked Holmes to replace him.
