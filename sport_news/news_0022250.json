The 36-hole event kicks off on Monday with a split tee start beginning at 9:00 a.m. on the par 72, 6,967 yard Jack Nicklaus signature golf course. \nLeeAnn Noble, a 20-year old student-athlete on the University of North Georgia women's golf team, passed away on Monday, March 10, 2014 at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta following a lengthy battle with heart complications. \nLeeAnn was a member of the UNG women's golf team and a nursing student who received a heart transplant when she was 12 years old. In January on 2014 she experienced a heart attack from which she was unable to recover. \nIn addition to being a leader on her team, LeeAnn was a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee and was an active and involved member of the university community. Before coming to UNG she was a standout golfer at nearby Gainesville High School where she graduated in the top four percent of her class and was named the Hall County Player of the Year in 2011. \nLeeAnn and teammate Bridget Sandy were featured on as the cover story of the NCAA's Champion Magazine. The four-page spread and accompanying cover detailed the girls' early childhood battles with a heart transplant (Noble) and leukemia (Sandy) and how their parallel lives came to a fortunate intersection in the road at UNG. \nBoth student-athletes were Make-A-Wish recipients and are using their amazing stories of courage to spearhead the school's Make-A-Wish initiative. \nHome to the University of North Georgia men's and women's golf teams, Achasta Golf Club is located just a few short miles from the Dahlonega campus. This natural, classic golf course blends harmoniously with its surroundings, located in the foothills of the North Georgia Mountains along the Chestatee River with the river coming into play on over half the holes. \nAchasta was home of the PGA Tour's 2007-2008 AT&T Classic Qualifier, 2002-2006 Bell South Classic Open Qualifier, 2002 Georgia State Amateur Qualifier, 2003 US Open Qualifier and the 2004 Georgia State Mid-Am Qualifier. \n2nd Annual LeeAnn Noble Memorial Field: Brenau University", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:31:31.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
