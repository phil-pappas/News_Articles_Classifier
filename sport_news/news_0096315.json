The disclosure of the weapons by Celinez Nunez, assistant special agent of US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Agent came as fresh details emerged about the suspect in Thursday's rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland. Six of the guns, plus body armour and five magazines of ammunition, were recovered from the campus where the gunman stormed into a classroom, killing nine persons before he was shot dead by the police, Nunez said at a press conference. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin declined to name the gunman, saying, “Again, you will not hear anyone from this law enforcement operation use his name. I continue to believe that those media and community members who publicise his name will only glorify his horrific actions. And eventually, this will only serve to inspire future shooter.” Law enforcement sources confirmed reports identifying the suspect as Chris Harper-Mercer, 26. The gunman shot a professor and then ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion before he shot them one by one, according to survivors' accounts. Another seven guns were found at the apartment he shared with his mother in nearby Winchester, Nunez said. Although the authorities have disclosed scant information about the gunman, they appeared to be learning more about him and why he might have opened fire. The shooter left behind a “multipage, hated-filled” statement in the classroom, according to a tweet from an NBC reporter. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:22:52.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
