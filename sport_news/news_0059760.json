(AP) - Officials in a New Hampshire town say the work for a Superfund site cleanup is scheduled to start.\nThe Fletcher's Paint Superfund site cleanup in Milford will involve transporting about 30,000 cubic yards of material to and from the site. About 1,500 truckloads of hazardous materials will be taken away, and another 1,500 truckloads of fill eventually brought in.\nMore than 800 drums of contaminated material had been stored behind the Fletcher plant.\nPreliminary work began about a week or two ago with the removal of electrical wires and trees and the decommissioning of the Environmental Protection Agency's sampling wells.\nThe Nashua Telegraph reports ( http://bit.ly/1hAEqhY ) Milford Administrator Mark Bender says the work will be \"very disruptive.\"\nThe work will go into December, possibly resume next spring and continue into 2017.\nInformation from: The Telegraph, http://www.nashuatelegraph.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
