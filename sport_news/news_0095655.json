Setting a personal best on that course is hard to do,” coach Adams said. Waitsburg’s Joe Leamy finished with a time of 22:45, Tom House soon followed with another personal record at 22:54. Koby Harris represented the Cardinals in the middle school division’s two-mile race, and he crossed the finish line in 15:48.6 and 12th place. The Cardinals next have a home meet Wednesday, and race again on Saturday at the Richland Invite.
