Talk of making a run at the national championship in large part overshadowed the fact that Kyle Whittingham’s club became bowl eligible on Saturday, grabbing its all-important sixth victory of the season. \nOf course this would be one fan’s reaction: In fact, Utah could not bother showing up for the next 6 games & the worst that could possibly happen is playing BYU in the Vegas bowl. LOL — Dan Sorensen (@DSorensen) October 18, 2015 \n2. Britain Covey debacle: Unfortunately for Utah, the most talked about moment of the game on Twitter was Britain Covey’s “pass” in the end zone on a kickoff that resulted in a safety for Arizona State during the third quarter. \nA sampling of some of the comments made nationwide: This is NOT how to football: http://t.co/v1DCdKPmFL pic.twitter.com/Q83SFDVxLU — SB Nation (@SBNation) October 18, 2015 Dumbest thing I have ever seen.... — Charles Barnard (@ccb1212) October 18, 2015 Just when you thought this day couldn't get weirder. — Stewart Mandel (@slmandel) October 18, 2015 Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha — The Blue Brethren (@BlueBrethren) October 18, 2015 Since when is this the signal for a safety?

Chase Hansen sees time at safety: Few players have caught the excitement of Utah fans more than freshman quarterback Chase Hansen, and he made an appearance on Saturday night on defense. \nHansen saw a few snaps at safety, a move Whittingham later said he made to help improve the depth there after Andre Godfrey got injured. \nThe freshman’s appearance on the field certainly got the Twitterverse’s attention: Great did we move Chase Hansen to safety, Whit hates the feeling of having a QB? — Hypothetically Awful (@MACtheSPORK) October 18, 2015 Chase Hansen to defense? I can't. .. I mean... I just.... Wilson better stay healthy and we'd better win this year. Just... wow — ASSU Bum Freckles (@PortlandUte) October 18, 2015 CHASE HANSEN! — Brittany G (@Fibby1123) October 18, 2015 Chase Hansen is an unreal athlete. NFL athlete. If he sticks at safety he'll play a weddle role. QB and Safety snaps throughout game — Jake murphy (@Jake_Murphy82) October 18, 2015 \n4. Did Whittingham try to ice Phillips?: With Utah ahead 24-18 and less than five minutes left in the contest, kicker Andy Phillips lined up for a 35-yard field goal attempt. Make it, and it’s a two-possession game. Miss, and the Sun Devils could win with a touchdown. \nPhillips appeared ready to kick, but then Whittingham called a timeout. Ute fans were not happy: Did Kyle just ice Semi-automatic Andy?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:18:31.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
