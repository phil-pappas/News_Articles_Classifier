Regardless of who you think is right or wrong it is corrosive,” Tory said. “I was asked the other day what allows us to maintain an independent identity in the face of living next door to the United States and I said it is because we embrace diversity here. That has added to our values and it has strengthened our values.”\nThe Conservative party has come under fire for its position on the niqab with some accusing the party of using divisive politics to distract Canadians from the important issues.\nAt the same time, the party has enjoyed a resurgence in the polls that has coincided with Harper’s public comment on the niqab.\nIn fact, a Forum Research poll released on Thursday found that the issue has captured the attention of a notable minority of respondents with 20 per cent indicating that it would influence their vote and 11 per cent saying it would influence their vote “a great deal”\nSpeaking with reporters, Tory said he can understand both sides but ultimately wants the debate to be put aside.\n“I just think these debates don’t prove to be very productive because I am not sure there is a right or wrong answer. I just hope they come to an end,” he said.\nRemember for instant breaking news follow @cp24 on Twitter.\nRelated Stories Harper: Niqab ban for public servants would be considered", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:45:51.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
