On Friday, the outspoken sports analyst talked with former Grantland staff writer, now New York Times critic at large, Wesley Morris and said ESPN did not support Grantland, the blog started by Simmons. He said, \"Websites are like plants, you got to water them\"Unfortunately, ESPN is good at building stuff and creating stuff, launching stuff, but there comes a point where you have to decide what does this mean, how can we get from point A to point B to point C to point D to point E. We weren't even on their mobile page until I think January.
