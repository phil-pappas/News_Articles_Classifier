A family representative says ... \nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Lamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian have decided to stay married as the former NBA star continues his recovery a week after he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel. \nKardashian's lawyer, Laura Wasser, went before a Los Angeles judge Wednesday to withdraw divorce papers filed in December 2013. The judge granted the request. \nThe one-page document signed by Odom and Kardashian was submitted without prejudice, which means it can be refiled at later date. \nKardashian has been by Odom's side since he was found in extremely critical condition Oct. 13 at the Love Ranch brothel in the rural community of Crystal, Nevada. He regained consciousness Friday and was transported to Los Angeles on Monday to recover. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
