West Virginia looks to end losing skid at Iowa State By Nicole Curtin & Johnna Herbig   The West Virginia University volleyball team is back on the road to take on the Iowa State Cyclones tonight. The Mountaineers are coming into this game with an overall record of 5-14 and are coming off of a 3-0 loss to Baylor. \"We had a couple good days of practice,\" said head coach Reed Sunahara. \"That kind of led us into the first set where we did some really nice things. The energy was good, we were up 21-16, then we had a meltdown. We have to retain our focus and that level of execution, and it has to be high all the time. If we can do that, we can play with any team. \" Sophomore outside hitter Morgan Montgomery had 13 kills against Baylor, carrying the team’s offense. Freshman outside hitter Bridgett Talia followed with seven. Junior setter Haley Roe led the defense with seven digs, contributing to the team’s overall 22. On the other hand, Iowa State enters the match after defeating the TCU Horned Frogs last week, 3-1. The Cyclones are 11-6 so far this season, with a 4-2 Big 12 record. Freshman outside hitter Jess Schaben was the team’s leading player with 16 kills. Red shirt junior outside hitter Morgan Kuhrt followed behind her with 12 while Samara West had 11 kills and Alexis Conoway posted 10. Senior libero Caitlin Nolan completed her seventh 30-dig match and also her 35th straight match in double digits. Sophomore libero Branen Berta helped the defense by posting 15 digs herself, followed by junior outside hitter Ciara Capezio and sophomore setter Monique Harris, both getting 10 digs. This is the first time these two teams have met since 2014. In last season’s first matchup, Iowa State took a 3-1 win at home; they returned to Morgantown in early November for another win this time a 3-0 shut-out. Schaben is really succeeding in her freshman year on the Cyclones; she leads the team and ranks sixth in the Big 12 in kills per set, averaging 3.23. So far she has tallied 197 kills for the offense, but she isn’t alone on the attack. Capezio has posted 129 kills this season, averaging 2.58 kills per set, and middle blocker Samara West has scored 2.37 per set, with a season total of 128 so far. While defending these hitters might be one of the biggest challenges West Virginia faces tonight, it also has the issue of attacking errors from its own players. Montgomery has been leading the offense all season. With 266 total kills, she averages 3.8 per set and is third in the Big 12 for kills overall. Junior middle blocker Hannah Shreve usually puts down some important kills in any match and will probably need to do so tonight, while also trying to stop ISU’s West from her conference-leading hitting percentage. Errors seem to be haunting the Mountaineers this year and will have to be continuously improved upon. As the leading scorer, Montgomery has racked up 141 errors on the net this year. Giving Iowa State those free points and the ball back on its side of the net will make it that much easier for the Cyclones to take the win again. West Virginia could surely use one now to break its losing streak.
