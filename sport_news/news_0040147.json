Yeldon among strong plays in Week 6 backfield Posted: October 15, 2015 - 11:56am Photos AUGUST 2015 FILE PHOTOGRAPH/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Kansas City Chiefs running back Charcandrick West, left, is expected to get the majority of touches in the Chiefs' backfield in the wake of starter Jamaal Charles' ACL tear. By Terry Blount thepigskinner@hotmail.com \nThe carnage that has consumed the 2015 NFL and fantasy football seasons continued in Week 5 when Kansas City Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles found his way to injured reserve, tearing his ACL versus the Bears. \nWhen it rains, it pours. \nLet’s take a look at Week 6. Dallas, Oakland, St. Louis and Tampa Bay are on byes. \nAfter grinding my teeth since draft day for my questionable decision to draft Philadelphia Eagles running back DeMarco Murray , I was relieved to see his stat line of 83 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown to go with seven receptions for 37 receiving yards in Week 5. On the surface, this week’s matchup versus the New York Giants isn’t good, as the G-Men have permitted a mere 80.6 rushing yards per game (second in the league). However, a closer look reveals the Giants have allowed the third-most receiving yards and the 14th most fantasy points to the position. I know one game is not a trend, but I think Murray is ready to resume his role as a dominant fantasy back and will have an ample chance to do so in this Monday Night Football matchup. \nThe debate has begun: which Chiefs back will replace Charles as the starter? Most analysts and owners expect rookie Charcandrick West to be the guy and have almost universally shunned veteran Knile Davis . Even Chiefs coach Andy Reid stated West’s speed and agility favors how Charles plays rather than Davis’ north-south running style. While I believe with the experts that West will likely get more overall touches, I still believe that Chiefs might defer to the larger Davis in the red zone, particularly in goal-to-go situations. The Chiefs backs average 25.2 carries per game (20th in the league) and if they continue to run at that pace, then West would likely be a fantasy RB3 in most situations. This week West will face a Vikings rush defense that has allowed 125.5 rushing yards per game (26th in the league) but has allowed only 19.3 fantasy points per game in non-PPR leagues (17th in the NFL). Ultimately, snag West from waivers and start him if you need help with a bye replacement or flex this week. If you’re desperate, look at Davis. \nThis year I have actually recommended two Jacksonville Jaguars for fantasy duty (without laughing) and I’m about to do it again. Along with emerging fantasy contributors such as quarterback Blake Bortles and wide receiver Allen Hurns, Jags running back T.J. Yeldon is now making some noise with his improving performances. Yeldon followed up a Week 4 line of 105 rushing yards with five receptions and a receiving touchdown in Week 5 to boost otherwise ho-hum yardage points. This week Yeldon tangles with a Houston defense that has allowed 114.2 rushing yards per game (22nd in the league) and the eighth most fantasy points to running backs this season. This is a sweet match for an improving player from an up-and-coming offense. Get Yeldon in the game as a solid RB2. \nDespite the 63-yard touchdown run by Arizona Cardinals running back Andre Ellington in Week 5, I still believe Chris Johnson is in firm control of the starting running back job in the desert. Johnson has recorded 296 yards in his last three games and chipped in two rushing touchdowns. He’ll face a decent Steelers run defense in Week 6 and should be considered a low-end RB2 or strong flex, but I still believe Johnson should be the preferred fantasy back over Ellington long term. \nOver his last three games, Cleveland Browns tight end Gary Barnidge has averaged more than six receptions and 106 receiving yards while adding a touchdown per game, all with nearly nine targets per contest. His Week 5 catch with his thighs should have earned him extra fantasy points. He’ll face a Denver defense in Week 6 that has not allowed a touchdown to the tight end position all season, but Cleveland is obviously committed to this guy as a major cog in their passing game. Barnidge is a solid TE1. Go get him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:04:14.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
