EAST RUTHERFORD — The debris lay scattered all around him, littering the green, locker room carpet.\nBalled-up tape. Inside-out socks. A sweat-soaked T-shirt and an overturned helmet with the pink mouthguard still wedged in the facemask.\nChris Ivory sat silently amid the rubble of another NFL game, his head hung low and his long dreadlocks cascading over his shoulders.\nIt had been a long day. But it was probably the best day in the Jets running back's career.\nAnd when reporters encircled him to ask about the comments from Pro Bowler Brandon Marshall, who for the second time in five days declared Ivory the best running back in the league, he cautiously agreed.\n\"I feel like I'm one of them, you know?\" he said in a soft voice, the words barely rising above a whisper.\nIvory, 27, made a convincing argument Sunday in the Jets' 34-20 victory over Washington at MetLife Stadium.\nHe compiled 196 yards from scrimmage — the most in his six seasons.\nHe rushed for 146 yards on 20 carries against the league's sixth-ranked defense. He caught three passes for 50 yards. He broke runs of 54 and 32 yards. And he scored a 1-yard touchdown.\nThis came after he rushed for a career-best 166 yards against Miami in London.\nIt was the first back-to-back 100-yard rushing games of his career. And Ivory became the first Jet to rush for at least 140 yards in back-to-back games since Freeman McNeil in 1985, according to ESPN.\nAs Ivory has gone, so have the Jets (4-1).\n\"They laughed at me,\" Marshall said, referring to Wednesday when he first proclaimed Ivory was the best back in the NFL.\n\"They laughed at me when I said Ivory's the best. And he is. And he proved it again today.\n\"Eight-man box. Nine-man box. They came out and said, 'We don't care about the wide receivers. We're going to stop the run.' And Ivory again came out and put up over 140 yards.\n\"He's amazing. And he's the best in the league.\"\nThe 6-foot, 222-pound Ivory has rushed for 460 yards and four touchdowns in four games. The only game the Jets lost — Sept. 27 to Philadelphia — came when he was injured (quadriceps).\nNot bad for a fourth-round draft pick the Jets sent the Saints in 2013 to acquire him.\n\"We rely on him. He comes through every time,\" coach Todd Bowles said.\nIvory — who ran outside more than usual on Sunday — says the biggest difference is his patience.\n\"It's probably the most patient I've been throughout my career,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:45.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
