Lee, Englishman Greg Owen and Americans Chad Campbell, Ricky Barnes, Ryan Palmer and Brendon Todd.\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:16:39.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
