Fellow American Stacy Lewis and South Korea's Ha Na Jang were tied for second.\nKorda has only one top-10 finish this season, a tie for second in January in Florida in the season-opening event. The three-time LPGA Tour winner is 50th in the world ranking and 56th on the money list, barely enough to get a spot in the tournament.\nThe third-ranked Lewis, also winless this season, matched Korda with a 65. Jang had a 71. The second-round leader had a double bogey on the par-3 15th, saved bogey with a 20-footer on the par-5 16th and rebounded with a birdie on the par-3 17th.\nSecond-ranked Lydia Ko was three strokes back at 9 under along with defending champion Shanshan Feng and Xi Yu Lin.\nPlaying alongside Korda, Ko bogeyed the 18th for 68. The 18-year-old New Zealander is coming off consecutive victories in the Canadian Pacific Women's Open and Evian Championship, where she became the youngest major champion.\nFeng had a 69, and Chinese compatriot Lin shot 71.\nTop-ranked Inbee Park, the 2012 winner, was 8 under after a 71. The South Korean star won two of the five majors this year and is tied with Ko for the tour victory lead with four.\nMorgan Pressel had a 63, the best round of the week, to get to 6 under. U.S. Solheim Cup teammate Michelle Wie also was 6 under after a 69.\nThe event is the first of five straight in Asia. The LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship is next week in South Korea, followed by stops in Taiwan, China and Japan.\nCONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
