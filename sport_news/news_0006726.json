Hononegah (14-3, 12-0 NIC-10) steamrolled the Blue Thunder 25-14 before losing momentum with a 25-23 second-set defeat. Sparked by power-kills from Sam Kavajecv and Courtney Larson, however, the Indians took charge and finished it off with a 25-19 third-set victory. It all but locked up the Indians' second straight solo NIC-10 title, but it didn't come without a battle. \"They came back with a lot of fight, and this one was a serious challenge, and a great test for us,\" said Larson, who was also one of the stars when Hononegah powered through to a two-set win over North earlier in the season. \"They got us there for awhile, but we never backed down, even when they got the momentum away from us. This team, one thing's for sure, we're going to battle for it.\" Senior Michaela Nelson took charge in the front row for Hononegah much of the way through Set No. 1, helping the Indians build early leads of 8-3, 12-6 and eventually 19-8. Nelson's quick-kill followed by a touch-drop shot late in the match stifled Blue Thunder attempts to get back into. However, North (12-8, 7-4) got into a groove early in the second set and never surrendered control. Bailey Neiber smacked down three of her team-high seven kills during a stretch that lifted the Blue Thunder to a 12-4 advantage. Kavajecv's hard kill from the outside-front row later knotted the set up at 22-all, but one more untouchable kill from Neiber and big block from Stephanie Grose slammed the door for the Blue Thunder's second-set charge. \"We really showed something by coming back after that rough first set,\" North coach Nicole Miller said. \"It was just our heart that showed through in the second one. But they really came after us in the third, and they can attack you from so many angles, with so many girls, it's just tough.\" The Blue Thunder battled back and forth with the Indians early in the third, with Neiber earning back-to-back kills to tie it at 9-apiece. But once Hononegah got rolling, they couldn't be stopped. Power slams from Kavajecv and Erika Gustafson made it impossible for North to pull off the upset down the stretch. Hononegah's depth shown through with Kavajecv, Gustafson and Larson all leading the way with seven kills. Arianna Contreras tallied 14 digs. North also got four kills and six digs from Elise Rand and 13 assists by Bailey Carlton.
