I just got to get it back to José.”\nWhile Byma waits for a response, he’s keeping it at home in a case, only taking it out when the Jays need some luck.\nIt did the trick on Monday night , when he set it on his coffee table after fans on Twitter pleaded with him to pull it out, but didn’t help on Tuesday evening when the Jays got pummeled by the Kansas City Royals, losing 14-2 .\nThat hasn’t shaken Byma.\nHe said, “Back in 1985, we were up on the Royals 3-1 in a series and they came back to win it so maybe it is our turn this time. We can make it happen.”\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays-Royals ALCS Game 5 tip sheet: Price available out of bullpen\nMaple Leafs defenceman Jake Gardiner out with injury", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:46:03.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
