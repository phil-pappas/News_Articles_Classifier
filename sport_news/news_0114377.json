New Jersey hasn't lost since starting the season 0-3-1. \nTyler Ennis, Ryan O'Reilly and Jack Eichel scored for Buffalo. Rookie goaltender Linus Ullmark made his NHL debut for the Sabres (2-6-0). \nBuffalo lost Evander Kane to an apparent left leg injury midway through the third period. A high-profile addition last season, Kane needed to be helped off the ice and did not return. \nCammalleri's goal tied it 2-2 8:57 into the second, and then Schlemko put New Jersey ahead with 49 seconds left in the period. \nAbout midway through the third, Ennis mishandled a puck at the Devils' blue line and Henrique scored on a shorthanded breakaway with a backhand shot past Ullmark. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:06:32.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
