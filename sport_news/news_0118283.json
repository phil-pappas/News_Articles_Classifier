I’m very proud,” Gastman said. “I cherish all the years that I’ve been here. And I think about the accomplishments of our athletes.”\nGastman, of River Edge, played volleyball for Bogota High School and Ramapo College before coming to Waldwick. She’s built the Warriors into a perennial power, despite being at one of the smallest schools in North Jersey. During her 15-year tenure, the Warriors are 200-103 and have won three division titles, most recently in 2011.\n“The most important thing is always about teaching,” Gastman said. “I’ve had a consistent coaching staff for the past 10 years, so I think we work really well together. Generally speaking, we’ve taught the girls to be well-rounded in all the spots and not just their positions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:29.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
