The substance was not identified in court papers.\nThe Canadian player, who was once ranked No. 5, contends her injuries \"were caused solely by the reason of carelessness, negligence, wanton and willful disregard on the part of Defendant USTA.\" She claims the organization didn't keep the locker room in a \"safe and suitable condition\" because the organization failed to maintain, clean and repair the floor, which led to her fall.\nBouchard said her world ranking has dropped at least 13 spots since the incident last month and believes it is likely to continue to decline.\nChris Widmaier, a spokesman for the United States Tennis Association, declined comment, saying the organization had a longstanding policy of not discussing ongoing litigation.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
