Chaminade Recruiting wrap: Committed to Duke . Performance: Class of 2016's No. 3 player, Tatum looked as good as Rivals.com has ever seen him. As usual, the refined skill he plays with shined brightly. Tatum is better in the low- and mid-post than most elite post players and he's boosted his athleticism and slash game since the summer's end. It's pretty easy to tell a guy who spends a lot of time in the gym honing his craft and Tatum clearly puts in the work. 3 Michael Porter (2017) Columbia (Mo.) Father Tolton Recruiting wrap: Visiting Kansas for Late Night, Missouri , Duke, Virginia , Indiana , Washington , Syracuse and others involved. Father is an assistant coach for Mizzou women's team, younger brother Jontay Porter is committed to Washington. Performance: With Tatum and Porter, the state of Missouri's parochial schools were more than well-represented. A smooth 6-foot-8 wing with feathery shooting touch and an off-the-charts basketball IQ, Porter makes the game look too easy. He passed the ball as well as he scored and has explosiveness when he takes off on drives to the hoop. 4 Troy Brown (2017) Las Vegas (Nev.) Centennial Recruiting wrap: Brown took recent visits to California and Stanford . He has trips planned to Arizona and Utah this month. Duke, Kansas, UCLA and more are involved. Performance: Brown looked like a high school version of NBA player Evan Turner. He played time at the point, he attacked off the dribble, he defended at a high level and he also played the shooting guard and small forward positions. Brown's jumper has always been a bit suspect but he was hitting it over the weekend. Physical maturity and aggressive play make him a versatile utility guard. 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:26:53.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
