The Knights won 13-0 in 2014 in first-ever meeting between the two schools. ... Johnson snapped its four-game losing streak against Riverside and got its ground game going. The Knights would like to build some momentum over the final month of the season but faces a tough finish against East Hall, Franklin County, and Dawson County, three of the top four teams in Region 7-AAA. ... Defense and turnovers are the key for Johnson. The Knights are 2-0 when allowing less than 24 points and 0-4 when allowing more than 24 points. They had more than a dozen turnovers in their four losses. ... Osborne has really been struggling of late. The Cardinals have been outscored 125-14 over their last three games after a narrow 26-20 loss to Lakeside-Atlanta early in the season. \nLAMBERT at HABERSHAM CENTRAL -- WHERE: Raider Stadium, Mt. Airy -- RADIO: 99.3 FM -- LAMBERT (4-1, 4-0 Region 6- ): Bye last week, defeated North Forsyth 42-14 two weeks ago -- HABERSHAM CENTRAL (0-5, 0-4 Region 6- ): Bye last week, lost 48-20 to Alpharetta two weeks ago -- NOTABLE: Lambert leads series 1-0, The Longhorns won 51-6 in first-ever meeting between the two schools. ... Offense in new coach Benji Harrison’s spread attack has not been the problem for the Raiders, who have averaged 24.0 ppg. The defense has yielded a staggering 50.6 ppg (253 points), which puts them next to last in Class . Only Berkmar (351) has given up more. ... However, points may be hard to come by as Lambert has held four of five opponents to 17 points or less and the Longhorns have won four straight. ... Habersham Central could be catching the Longhorns at a good time as they may be looking ahead to Northview and West Forsyth as they try to stay atop the region standings. \nLANIER at GAINESVILLE -- WHERE: City Park Stadium, Gainesville -- RADIO: 1240 AM ESPN Radio -- LANIER (5-0, 4-0 Region 8- ): Ranked No. 6 in Class ; Bye last week, defeated Loganville 21-6 two weeks ago -- GAINESVILLE (4-1, 4-0 Region 8- ): Defeated Salem 34-6 last week -- NOTABLE: Lanier leads series 1-0. The Longhorns won 26-23 in 2014 in first-ever meeting between the two schools. Last year’s contest was one of the best games of the season in northeast Georgia and this year’s affair could be just as tasty for fans. ... The two teams are the only remaining unbeaten teams in the region. This game last season ultimately decided the region champ but Gainesville still has road games against Clarke Central and Loganville while Lanier has road games at Salem and Winder-Barrow so nothing is expected to be decided Friday night. ... It should be a slugfest with the two best defenses in the region. Lanier has allowed just 26 points (6.5 ppg) in region games while the Red Elephants have yielded just 32 points (8.0 ppg) in region contests and forced 11 turnovers in their last two games. ... The key will be which offense is able to generate any sustainable drives. The Red Elephants have averaged 37.5 ppg since being shutout by Class No. 2 Grayson. QB Messiah Dorsey has thrown for 774 yards and 9 TDs and rushed for another 301 yards. RB Chris Byrd has a team-leading 391 yards rushes and has caught 17 passes as well. ... Lanier’s offense has struggled at times, especially after losing starting RB Ashton Barnes to injury. QB Tahj Tolbert has not any consistent receivers to throw too but brothers RBs Marcko and Marcella Baity have shown flashes of brilliance at times. \nMADISON COUNTY at CHESTATEE -- WHERE: War Eagle Stadium, Gainesville -- MADISON COUNTY (0-5, 0-2 Region 8-AAAA): Lost 26-11 to White County last week -- CHESTATEE (0-5, 0-2 Region 8-AAAA): Lost 56-0 to No. 3 Buford last week -- NOTABLE: Chestatee leads series 2-1. Madison County won 49-28 in 2014. ... Despite both teams being offensively challenged, this could be a high-scoring affair the way the two defenses have played this season. ... The War Eagles have battled injuries much of the season which has affected the defensive side of the ball. They are allowing 42.4 ppg so far. Turnovers have been an issue for the offense, which is averaging just 10.0 ppg. ... The Red Raiders are yielding 35.6 ppg, and gave up 26 to a White County offense that had scored 23 total points on the season until last week. Offensively Madison County is averaging just 13.2 ppg. \nMILL CREEK at MOUNTAIN VIEW -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Mountain View Stadium, Lawrenceville -- MILL CREEK (6-0, 3-0 Region 7- ): Ranked No. 5 in Class ; defeated Meadowcreek 52-0 last week -- MOUNTAIN VIEW (1-5, 0-3 Region 7- ): Lost 24-7 to Collins Hill last week -- NOTABLE: Mill Creek leads series 4-1. The Hawks won 55-7 in 2014. ... This looks like a mismatch on paper with the Hawks not yielding a single point in region play to this point. The Bears have scored just 21 total points in region contests. ... Mill Creek cannot afford a letdown with a tough finish with Collins Hill, Norcross, and Peachtree Ridge. All four teams are tied at 3-0 but must face each other over the final month of the season. ... The Bears were showing some offensive prowess coming into region play averaging 24.3 ppg but have not found an answer for the defensive-minded 7- . They are yielding 32.6 ppg while Mill Creek is averaging 41.3 ppg on the season. \nMORGAN COUNTY at JEFFERSON -- WHERE: Memorial Stadium, Jefferson -- MORGAN COUNTY (3-2, 1-0 Region 8-AAA): Defeated East Jackson 37-7 last week -- JEFFERSON (6-0, 2-0 Region 8-AAA): Ranked No. 3 in Class AAA; defeated No. 7 Elbert County 27-8 last week -- NOTABLE: Morgan County leads series 11-5-2. Jefferson won 51-16 in 2014 in first meeting between the teams since 1969. ... The Dragons climbed a step higher toward its second straight region title last week but cannot afford a letdown against a solid Bulldogs team that has won three straight. ... Morgan County sits in surprising third place in the region at the moment and is looking for its first playoff appearance since 2012. The Bulldogs have done it with defense so far allowing just 12.8 ppg overall and just 8.5 ppg over its last four games. They will be tested this week. ... Jefferson’s ground game is among the best in the state behind So. RB Colby Wood, who already has over 1,000 yards on the season, and a dominating offensive line. Whichever unit wins this battle will more than likely win the game. ... The Dragons defense has been slouch allowing just 8.1 ppg on the season. \nPEACHTREE RIDGE at NORTH GWINNETT -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Tom Robinson Memorial Stadium, Suwanee -- PEACHTREE RIDGE (4-2, 3-0 Region 7- ): Defeated Duluth 56-0 last week -- NORTH GWINNETT (2-4, 0-3 Region 7- ): Lost 38-10 to Norcross last week -- NOTABLE: North Gwinnett leads series 10-1. The Bulldogs won 51-24 in 2014. The only Lions win came in 2008 at home. ... It’s simple for North Gwinnett: win and the Bulldogs are still alive, barely. Lose, and their streak of 11-straight playoff appearances will come to an end. Even with a win, however, Peachtree Ridge would have to lose out and the Bulldogs win out for them to steal a playoff spot. ... North Gwinnett does not hold any tiebreakers over the other three undefeated teams (Norcross, Collins Hills, Mill Creek) and since all three still play each other the Bulldogs only chance is to beat the Lions and hope they lose out. ... It won’t be easy. Peachtree Ridge is averaging nearly 44 ppg in region play while a young Bulldogs defense is yielding 35 ppg overall and 39.3 ppg in region contests. ... But, North Gwinnett has never lost to the Lions at home. \nRABUN COUNTY at OGLETHORPE COUNTY -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Patriots Stadium, Lexington -- RABUN COUNTY (5-1, 2-0 Region 8-AA): Ranked No. 8 in Class AA; defeated Social Circle 44-0 last week -- OGLETHORPE COUNTY (0-6, 0-2 Region 8-AA): Lost 41-6 to Union County last week -- NOTABLE: Rabun County leads series 12-9. The Wildcats won 49-7 in 2014. ... It could be a trap game on the road with the Wildcats perhaps looking to next week’s showdown with rival Union County to stay atop the region standings. ... It doesn’t look good for the Patriots on paper as Rabun County has the stingiest defense in Class AA allowing just 43 total points (7.1 ppg) including three consecutive shutouts, while the Patriots are averaging just 13.3 ppg. ... The Rabun County offense is averaging 31.8 ppg while the Oglethorpe County defense sits at the bottom of Class AA in points allowed with 279 (46.5 ppg). The Wildcats have averaged 36.8 ppg during their five-game winning streak. \nRIVERSIDE MILITARY at WASHINGTON-WILKES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:04:54.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
