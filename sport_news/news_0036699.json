Indeed, the kid has become an inspiration to him. \nThat’s because Matthew has cancer. \nEichel met Matthew shortly after being drafted by the Sabres during a tour of a cancer centre. It was a meeting that changed both their lives. \n“I remember just meeting him at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and seeing him in his bed and how much of a struggle he was going through,” Eichel recalled Wednesday. \n“He was at one of our games not so long ago. He was happy. He loves the Sabres. I think I can make him feel a little bit better if I bring him to the locker room or just talk to him. \n“They look up to us. It’s something we can do that is pretty simple to make someone’s day a lot better.” \nSuch mature words from an 18-year-old. \nYes, Dion, Jack Eichel is indeed far beyond his years.” \nQUOTE, UNQUOTE \n“What bit us in the ass is that we didn’t play very well in the third period.”— Maple Leafs forward P.A. Parenteau \nCROSS CHECKS \nBlood was gushing from Phaneuf’s face with 11:36 remaining in regulation after he collided with an oncoming Kane. The Leafs — including outspoken coach Mike Babcock — were looking for a penalty on the play, preferably a major for a butt end. Instead, no call was made on the Buffalo forward ... Matt Hunwick once again was a steadying force back on the blueline but took a silly interference penalty with just 14 seconds remaining in the second period ... While on the topic of needless infractions, Nick Spaling was called for a goalie interference minor at 8:15 after running into the Sabres’ Chad Johnson ... Young defenceman Morgan Rielly continues to improve his defensive game under Babcock, doing a great job forcing Eichel wide to the outside during a rush late in the second period ... Early goals by the Leafs in the Queen City have been few and far between over the years, but Babcock’s team came out of the gate with some spunk, registering three of the game’s first four shots and getting a goal from Parenteau just 88 seconds after the opening faceoff ... Meanwhile, Jonathan Bernier wasn’t the guy allowing an early goal, certainly an improvement from the start of the season. \nLAST MINUTE OF PLAY \nSabres-Maple Leafs contests in Buffalo are usually boisterous affairs, with thousands of Toronto fans filling the First Niagara Center and making more noise than you hear at many home games at the Air Canada Centre. \nBut this was different. \nOn this night, there were far fewer blue-and-white jerseys in the building. In the upper reaches of Sections 324 and 325, where Leafs fans are usually found aplenty for these games, there were dozens of empty seats. \nMust have been an important event going on back in Toronto. \nSomething about a baseball game.
