Freshman center Diamond Stone, behind incumbent Damonte Dodd at the center position, is considered the 10th-best prospect in the 2016 class, followed by senior forward Jake Layman (No. 25) and sophomore point guard Melo Trimble (No. 36). \nIf you've got some time to kill and don't mind hearing the same instrumentals over and over, watch full scouting reports of the Terps' big three, courtesy of Mike Schmitz . \nDiamond Stone (No. 10 overall, No. 1 in Big Ten Conference, No. 3 center) \nJake Layman (No. 25 overall, No. 6 in Big Ten, No. 7 small forward) \nMelo Trimble (No. 36 overall, No. 7 in Big Ten, No. 9 point guard) Please enable Javascript to watch this video", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:44:56.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
