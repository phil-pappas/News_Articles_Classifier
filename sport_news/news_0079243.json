He not only used the facility to rededicate his life to football and to daily normalcy, he practically lived there while rehabbing his way back from a horrendous knee injury he suffered during his rookie season. Cardinals XTRA app: Get the latest news, analysis, scores, more \nThe only player that’s put in that many hours at the facility during that time is more than likely Fitzgerald, the most popular player in team history, the all-time record-holder in every receiving category that means anything, and the player Mathieu can’t wait to try and defend every day in practice. \n“You know why he’s made me a better pro?” Mathieu asks. “It’s just the simple fact that he comes to work every day, win, lose or draw. Whether he gets 10 catches or one catch, he’s the same guy. Every day . It never changes.” \nIn the prideful, “look-at-me-now” day and age of the NFL, that’s got to be a little unusual, right? \n“Yeah, very unusual,” Mathieu says. “Especially at the wide receiver position.” \nFor a man who once acknowledged he’s probably “got a little bit of diva in me,” Fitzgerald certainly doesn’t show it or say it or act it. Take last Sunday’s game in Pittsburgh, when quarterback Carson Palmer stared down young John Brown in the end zone with the game on the line and threw into double coverage. Arizona Cardinals vs. Baltimore Ravens: TV, radio, stadium information \nThe pass was intercepted, ruining any chance for a Cardinals’ comeback victory, and the face of the franchise was wide open on the play. \nFitzgerald ran an underneath crossing route and had his man beat if Palmer hadn’t forced things to the second-year pro he’s coddled beneath his wings, doing everything from inviting Brown to live and train with him during the offseason in Southern California to having Brown’s locker be placed next to him a year ago during Brown’s rookie season. \nBut would Fitzgerald complain about that particular play? Of course not. \n“I’ve still never seen it,” Mathieu insists. “And you know, you kind of look for it sometimes. As defensive players, when he catches nine passes or something the week before and the next week he doesn’t, we’re kind of looking for it. But he doesn’t (get mad). He’s one of those true professionals.” \nEven if Fitzgerald wasn’t enjoying the best start to a season in his 12-year career, which presently sees him ranked fifth in receptions (43), fourth in receiving yards (583) and tied for first in touchdown receptions (6), it’s doubtful he would complain much. He never does. \nHe wouldn’t even concede that he was open on that fateful play that ultimately sealed the Cardinals’ fate in Pittsburgh. \n“Um, I don’t know if I was open,” Fitzgerald said. “James Harrison was dropping off in the flat and I know Carson saw him dropping out there. He didn’t want to throw it into that coverage. We’ve had the predicament happen before (in Super Bowl XLIII) and we don’t want a re-enactment.” Arizona Cardinals find bargains late in free agency \nBut on an afternoon that saw Palmer target Brown 14 times during what turned out to be a career day for Brown, who finished with 10 catches for 196 yards, didn’t it irk Fitzgerald that the Cardinals didn’t turn to him in the clutch? That’s what he is, after all. Clutch. \nIn the last two drives of each of Arizona’s two losses, when both games were still at hand, Fitzgerald was targeted a total of just four times. He caught all four passes for 30 yards. \nBrown, meanwhile, was thrown to nine times in those instances, catching six balls for 90 yards. Rookie running back David Johnson was targeted six times in those four drives, with three receptions for 50 yards and a touchdown. Like Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd was targeted four times over that span. He caught three balls for 35 yards. \nBut with the game on the line, shouldn’t the Cardinals be trying to get the football to Fitzgerald, especially considering the phenomenal start he’s having? \n“No, because Larry had nine or 10 targets and close to 100 yards, Smoke has 200 just because they couldn’t cover him,” coach Bruce Arians said. “But no, he’s thrown it to Michael on third down. We spread it around as much as any team in the league, so no. (Palmer) just misread a coverage.” \nFitzgerald, who needs 52 yards to move past Irving Fryar (12,785) for 17th on the NFL’s all-time list, is confident that passes will keep coming his way. But there’s no reason to force it when it isn’t there, he adds. Arizona Cardinals looking for spark in run game \n“Teams are not going to allow me just to run open and catch balls,” Fitzgerald said. “I mean, obviously later in the game, they’re going to probably come to me and try to find me in situations. But it makes no sense, no matter who you are or what you’ve done, if you’ve got double coverage, you’ve got trap coverage on you, it makes no sense to throw me the football.” \nThat teams are continuing to employ double-coverage on him should speak volumes of how much Fitzgerald is still feared. To him, however, nothing’s really changed. It’s all a byproduct of the work he puts in, like on Thursday when they couldn’t keep him off the practice field even though Arians had given Fitzgerald a “veteran day off.” \nInstead, he shadowed every single rep at his position and spent the rest of the day working with the other wide receivers to make sure they were properly digesting every nuance of the game plan for Monday night’s primetime showdown against the visiting Baltimore Ravens. \nThat’s who he is. That’s what he does. And that’s why the huge numbers he’s managed to put up so far this season haven’t gone to his head. They never have. \n“Success is success, whether you’re younger or you’re older,” Fitzgerald said. “When I had success at 20, 21, it didn’t feel any different than having success at 32. It’s all the same. But whoever’s having success on this team, guys are happy for.” Profile: Larry Fitzgerald \nBut c’mon, doesn’t he feel rejuvenated having been able to contribute as well as he has at this stage in the game? \n“It’s nothing different to me, honestly,” Fitzgerald said. “It’s another year. And it’s another opportunity this Monday to go out and play the game I love and try to get back on a winning streak. It’s 12 years. I mean, it’s my job. Just like this is your job. I don’t treat it any different.” \nLet’s hope he never does. \nReach McManaman at bob.mcmanaman@arizonarepublic.com .
