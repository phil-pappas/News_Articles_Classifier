Beltre took swings in the batting cage Sunday night and received more treatment Monday. Bannister says running is probably “most problematic” for Beltre. \nTexas leads the best-of-five series 2-1. The Blue Jays have to win Monday to force a deciding Game 5 in Toronto. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:47:24.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
