Dickey’s knuckleball didn’t dance or dart past Royals bats. It didn’t even shimmy like Johnny Cueto’s quick hips and quicker pitches. With his knuckleball appearing as flat as a Saskatchewan highway, he faced 12 men, seven of whom reached and five who scored. \nNot a good start as the most optimistic Jays would say. \nWith Dickey gone after 1⅔, the Jays bullpen didn’t really have a long man — no one like Danny Cox, Al Leiter or even Todd Redmond — although Liam Hendriks pitched 4⅓ scoreless innings, his longest outing of the year. His outing was “borderline abuse,” according to Gibbons. \nThat left nine outs for the dilapidated bullpen to get with the Jays trailing 5-2. They eventually got them with the help of infielder Cliff Pennington ... the first position player to pitch in the post-season since a guy named Babe Ruth, but he had previous mound experience. \nSo, the Jays wake up Wednesday looking at only nine innings on their dance card. \n“We’re been there before,” said Aaron Sanchez, who will be called on to contribute if the Jays force the series back to Kansas City. \n“We were there three times against Texas.” \nThe Jays won two win-or-go-home games in Texas against the Rangers No. 3 and No. 4 starters Martin Perez and Derek Holland. And then they won Game 5 on Jose Bautista’s decisive homer and emphatic bat flip. \n“I don’t see it as being much different than the Texas series,” Marcus Stroman said. “We had to win three against them down 2-0. We have to win three against the Royals down 3-1.” \nStroman has been the Jays best starter since post-season began. \nDavid Price is winless as a starter, but won Game 4 in Texas (remember when Gibbons was knocked for lifting Dickey early?). And Price may come out of the bullpen in Game 5 behind Marco Estrada if help is needed. \nUnlike the back-end Rangers starters they faced, the Jays are facing the Royals Game 1 starter Edinson Volquez in Game 5. \n“We don’t have to do anything different,” Edwin Encarnacion said, “they have to beat us one more time. That won’t be easy. We don’t have any pressure on us.” \nThe Jays took three of four from the Royals at the Rogers Centre at the trade deadline. \n“We knew that they were a good squad,” Josh Donaldson told reporters. “They come up to the plate with a game plan. That’s a really good team. They have a lot of guys over there who go after it. \n“We have to be able to turn the page. Now, we have to pitch well, play solid defensively and hit well.” \nIt sounds so easy. \nA season so memorable, the first post-season team since 1993, may have nine innings left. \n“We’re down by two, I don’t see any difference between this and our series with Texas,” Russell Martin said. \nThe Jays fell down 2-0 to the Rangers after losing a heartbreaker in 14 innings when they lost lefty Brett Cecil. \nIn this one the Royals scored 14 times ... on the anniversary of the Jays rallying to beat the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the 1993 World Series in the rain at a soggy Veteran’s Stadium. \nEVERYWHERE ARE SIGNS \nThe TV monitors in the clubhouse were not turned to the Chicago Cubs-New York Mets game, FC Barcelona soccer or deer hunting as is the norm after a Jays game. \nAll the TVs were motionless and read: \n“First pitch 4.07 \n“Travel after game.” \nMark Lowe was used fifth out of the bullpen by the time the Royals had scored seven against LaTroy Hawkins and Ryan Tepera. \n“Our bags will be packed for the flight to Kansas City,” said Lowe, who got the final out of the eighth and ran into trouble in the ninth. \n“Not having Aaron Loup was probably a deciding factor,” said Lowe, who doubted he would be available to pitch in Game 5. \nLoup headed for the airport on a family matter leaving the Jays without a left-handed reliever. The Jays can’t replace Loup on the roster. \nCatcher Dioner Navarro said he was planning on making the flight to K.C. \n“We can’t think about Game 7, not yet, we have to think about winning Game 5, then travel to Kansas City. We know what we have to do. Right now all anyone should be thinking about is Estrada vs. Voloquez. \n“We’re flying to Kansas City.” \nSpirits may have been high/upbeat or whatever but no one was singing the Fats Dominio classic: \nI’m going to Kansas City \nKansas City, here I come \nI’m gonna be standing on the corner \n12th Street and Vine \nWith my Kansas City baby \nAnd a bottle of Kansas City wine. \nIt’s win Game 5 or the Jays that return for next season will be singing that other old classic. \n“I’m going to Dunedin. \n“To the Bobby Mattick Training Center next February \n“I’ll be at 1,700 Solon Ave, in Dunedin. \n“Wishing we had gone to Kansas City.” \nMY FAVORITE NETWORK \nDan Plesac on MLB Network: “Ryan Goins was unfairly criticized about that pop up that fell in Game 2. It was the lead-off hitter of the inning. Price is Toronto’s ace. He has to make some pitches and gets some outs.” \nHOW ’BOUT THEM ROYALS \nDuane Ward, who won World Series rings with the 1992-93 Jays, says that the Royals remind him of the Milwaukee Brewers of the early 1990s: “They had all those guys like Paul Molitor, Robin Yount, B.J. Surhoff, Pat Listach, Bill Spiers and Jim Gantner, who would hit the ball gap to gap on you, and then Rob Deer or Greg Vaughn, who could take you deep.” \nFormer Blue Jays Cy Young Award-winner Pat Hengten, who also won two World Series rings with the Jays, compared the Royals to the Tampa Bay Rays in 2002-04: “Carl Crawford and Rocco Baldelli were getting established. They had all these athletic, pesky players. We all thought ‘if this team ever gets pitching, watch out.’” \nPRE-GAME \nCarlos Delgado, the Blue Jays career leader in home runs with 336, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Mark Buehrle. And Delgado, who had 473 career home runs when a hip injury cut his career short, threw from atop the mound. \nJose Bautista is second behind Delgado with 243 homers, followed by Vernon Wells (223), Joe Carter (218) and George Bell (202). The rest of the top 10 contains Encarnacion (197), Jesse Barfield (179), Lloyd Moseby (149), Adam Lind (146) and Ernie Whitt (131). \nLAST WORD \n“You don’t really understand what is going on here, do you?” asked a long-time Blue Jays employee. “It’s 1985 in reverse ... we’re going to pay the Royals back for what they did in 1985.” \nThe Jays led the Royals 3-1, lost Game 5 at Royals Stadium, returned home to Exhibition Stadium and dropped decisions on back-to-back nights as the Royals went on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series.
