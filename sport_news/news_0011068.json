Clemson earned five corners in the first half but were unable to convert on the chances. The Tar Heels recorded two corners in the first half.The second half was very even as well. Clemson recorded six shots to North Carolina’s seven in the final 45 minutes of the match. North Carolina scored the game’s only goal in the 81 minute on a pass into the box that was touched into the right side of the net. Clemson continued to pressure the Tar Heels but failed to even the match and lost their third match of the season.Head coach Eddie Radwaski was proud of the way his team played despite the end result, “I was pleased with effort I kids gave especially in the first half of the game. I felt we controlled the tempo and were dangerous in all aspects of the game. We just weren’t fortunate enough to take advantage that we created for ourselves. North Carolina played a great game and played with a little bit more energy than us down the stretch and I really give them credit for the way they played.”Clemson will travel to Syracuse, N.Y. on Oct. 31 for its final regular season match of 2015. The match is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. at SU Soccer Complex.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:46:56.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
