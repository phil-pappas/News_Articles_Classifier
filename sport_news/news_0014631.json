A player crumples to the ground, strangely, and a ball drops. The position of the fielders gets pulled, just a little, because of the runner. The ball is hit and the pieces are put in motion and all the little things, the details — the position of the bat, the bend of the pitch, the fielders, the physics — add up to something, or nothing much.\nBut sometimes baseball is simple, too. The Toronto Blue Jays trail the Kansas City Royals 2-0 in the American League Championship Series, and Game 2 was the one where even the Royals weren’t fully sure how it happened. David Price’s Kryptonite? John Gibbons’s watch? Whatever caused Ryan Goins to turn his head at Jose Bautista, even though Bautista hadn’t said anything?\nThe big reason slumbered underneath all those things: The Blue Jays aren’t hitting. Or, more accurately, they’re not hitting the ball far enough, in the correct directions, at the right time, which is right now. As always, conditions could change.\n“Yeah, that’s how we win,” said manager John Gibbons. “We’ve been doing that all year. In those first couple of games against Texas, they held us in check, and we broke (out) in the games down here, and (scored) late to win the last game. They shut us down in the first game in Kansas City, and we scored the runs (on Saturday). But we were on the verge of an outburst. And Escobar made the great play in the second. And they got in the bases-loaded, one-out jam (in the sixth).\n“So that would have been the prime time to open that game up and it would have been a hell of a lot easier, that’s for sure. But that’s who we are. That’s how we win.”\nFor all their arms, it is. After the all-star break, this team did everything. It hit better than anyone, it pitched better than almost anyone, and the defence was full of gems. It showed in that weird, semi-arbitrary number that we’ve heard all season, and not the one about one-run games. No, the Jays were 6-35 before the all-star break when they scored four or fewer runs, and not counting the two post-clinch quadruple-A hangover games in Baltimore, and were 10-17 post all-star.\nThey are 0-4 with four or fewer in these playoffs. It’s not some magical threshold: after six innings of Game 2 you would have said one run would do it, because David Price was a scythe and the Royals were wheat. But it wasn’t.\nBetter pitching, colder weather, bigger parks, better defences, pressure, variance: pick your reason. The Jays hit an MLB-best .286/.359/.480 with runners in scoring position in the regular season, and in this tiny playoff window are hitting .191. The Royals were second in batting average with RISP in the regular season, hitting .281/.347/.426. In the playoffs, they are hitting .308. In the seventh inning or later they are hitting .342 overall, and have scored 20 of their 36 runs. The Royals come back, over and over. In Game 2, the Jays failed to make that mountain very difficult to climb.\nNow, not all outs are created equal. As Gibbons noted, with men at first and second in that second inning of Game 2, Russell Martin hit a ball harder than he had hit all year, and it found the glove of a diving Alcides Escobar. Double play.\nBut there have been plenty of emptier at-bats, too. Look, the debate over clutch is one that never comes to a satisfactory conclusion. You’d think some players would be able to focus more sharply when they need to, but the numbers never adequately bear it out. No, you usually are who you are, and what most people are in baseball is prone to the vagaries of hot streaks, cold streaks, good luck, bad luck. The Jays should be able to get to any pitcher, if given enough chances — Johnny Cueto, Chris Young, the Kansas City bullpen. This is a historically dominant offence. Eventually, they create the cracks.\n“That’s a good team that can put some runs up on the board in a hurry and smother you with offence,” said Kansas City manager Ned Yost. “You’ve got to pitch well, aggressively. We’ve got to play good defence, and do what we’ve been doing with the bats.”\nSometimes this game is simple. See the ball, hit the ball, hit the ball where the Kansas City Royals can’t catch the ball. The Toronto Blue Jays need to win four of the next five games they play, or their season is over. They’re great. They’ve hit the ball all year. Their last chances are on deck, and coming up.\nMore on thestar.com\nToronto Waterfront Marathon: Canada's Lanni Marchant qualifies for Rio Olympics\nArgentina tops Ireland, advances to Rugby World Cup semifinals", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:17:56.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
