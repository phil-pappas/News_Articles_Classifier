Her husband, Alex Paez, 48, was earlier charged with the same counts and is scheduled for trial in December. \nThe two — who travel across the country to compete in body-building competitions — were arrested on similar horse-abuse charges four years ago. The charges were dropped after they completed a “pre-trial intervention” program for first-time offenders. \nPaez’s lawyer, Alexander Michaels, on Friday said the newest charges “were no big deal.” \n“I wish the police would spend more time on human victims, and child victims, than on horses who skipped a meal,” Michaels said. \nBack in May, police and animal-rescue workers found three malnourished horses at the couple’s ranch in rural South Miami-Dade. All sported overgrown, untrimmed hooves that made walking difficult for the the animals. \nThe ranch grounds were so cluttered that the horses had little room to walk. \n“Flammable items were at the facility, along with old boats and trailers, outboard engines, buckets of paint, fiberglass material, cutting objects, garbage,” animal-rights volunteers said at the time. “There was absolutely no place to turn out the horses.” \nThe horses had once been healthy. Photos posted online show the muscle-bound bodybuilders – Cowan in a bikini, Paez shirtless and holding a giant sword a la Conan the Barbarian — posing with a gray mare at the beach in 2014. \nThe same mare, when seized by police, was so skinny its ribs protruded from its skin. \nThe horses are being cared for now by Laurie Waggoner, of The South Florida Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. \n“They’re doing well. They’ve gained a lot of weight,” Waggoner said Friday. “They’re friendly now. Before, you couldn’t touch them. They were completely wild.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:06:11.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
