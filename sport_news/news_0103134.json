His father, Peter, served as his caddie.\nComing off the United States' Presidents Cup victory last week in South Korea, Kuchar had five birdies and one bogey in the final round. He opened with rounds of 74 and 72 in high wind, and took a two-stroke lead into the final round.\n\"It was so challenging on Thursday and Friday,\" Kuchar said. \"I felt I was surviving but played some really steady, good golf and that was a real difference — I got off to a start where most people got beat up. I was able to play it 2-over par for the first 36 and had a really steady, nice solid weekend.\"\nAustralia's Aron Price was second after a 71.\nLocal favorite Vijay Singh shot a course-record 65 to tie for third at 1 over with New Zealand's Ryan Fox (67) and Australia's Nick Cullen (68). The 52-year-old Singh, a three-time major champion, designed the course. He opened with a 78 in the windy first round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:39:11.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
