The fall league is the final competition to determine “bowler of the year.” Other leagues and tournaments which earned points toward the bowler of the year title were the spring league, Spring Bowl, Liberty Bowl and Arkansas Open tournament. Winners and runners-up of these games earned points toward this honor, with 10 points awarded to the winners, 7 to second place, 5 to third place, and 3 to fourth place. All participants received 1 point for participating. The bowler with the most total points for all six competitions will be named “bowler of the year 2015,” and the winner will be announced at the annual Christmas party in December. \nThe fall league consisted of six 3-person teams. Each team plays every other team once during the five weeks of play. After the final matches on Oct. 6, the winning teams were: \nFirst place: Evelyn Wheatcroft, Sharon Sands and Gayle Annis. \nSecond place: Jack Board, Judy Brewer and Lyle Wheatcroft. \nThird place: Connie Weidert, Del Scheid and Dave Preboski. \nThe competition was exciting, and first place was won by only 1/2 point. The club has had a very successful season and several new members who joined during the year. They look forward to having more new people learn this fun and competitive game. \nAs of Oct. 1 through April 30, open bowling times are Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 1:30 p.m. They play through the winter as long as the temperature is 40 degrees or above. All are welcome to come at any of the open bowling times to learn about lawn bowling, meet some of the friendly and interesting members and try their hands at the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:40:53.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
