Gurley tore his ACL during his final season at Georgia, then entered the draft and was selected at No. 10 overall anyway -- before they threw him into game action.\nIn Week 3, St. Louis deemed Gurley healthy enough to play, but only got him onto the field for 14 of the team's 52 offensive snaps. He was given six carries that totaled 9 yards. Rams coach Jeff Fisher then remarked during the week that Gurley's six carries could have gone for 79 yards and that he would expect the rookie to play a lot more than 14 snaps against the Cardinals.\nThe Rams followed through on their promise to get Gurley more involved early, throwing him the ball on their first snap and then handing it to him on the next one. By the end of the first half, though, Gurley had just four carries. (By way of comparison, Tre Mason and Benny Cunningham had two each, while Tavon Austin had one as well.) The four totes totaled only 2 yards. He was hit behind the line of scrimmage on three of them.\nWhen Gurley's first carry of the second half saw him get dropped for a loss of 4 and push his game line to five carries for minus-2 yards, it looked like we'd be waiting at least another week to see him break out -- to show off the talent that helped him run through every defense in America and make it look easier than any college running back since Adrian Peterson .\nWhen the Rams got the ball back with 8:46 to go in the third quarter after a Larry Fitzgerald fumble, Gurley was still sitting on those five carries and minus-2 rushing yards. All he did in the final 23:46 of game time was carry the rock 14 times for 148 yards.\nIt started with a 23-yard run on a designed cutback, one in which he showed off his power by running through a tackle as well. He picked up 12 yards on the next play, and after being stuffed at the line of scrimmage on a third straight run, tacked on 4 more yards on his fourth carry of the drive. In the fourth quarter, he added runs of 12, 20, 30 and 52 yards. He ran between the tackles and outside them, through defenders and around them. He showed off his speed, vision and burst. He gave us the full show.\nAnd he did it all in less than a half of play, against a defense that came into the game having ceded the fifth-lowest yards per carry average in the NFL -- a defense that ranked seventh in Football Outsiders' rushing defense DVOA. That defense bottled him up early on, but once Gurley broke through into the second level for that first time, a switch flipped and he was the one in control. He looked smooth, powerful and most importantly, confident.\nHow confident? On his final carry of the day, Gurley scampered around left end and, with the Rams up by two and the Cardinals out of timeouts, sat down just inside the 10-yard line rather than try to cross the plane for his first career touchdown. He knows there will be plenty of those to come. Todd Gurley shows why the Rams drafted him so high.
