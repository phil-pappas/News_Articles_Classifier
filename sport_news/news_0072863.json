Diversity in the categories of Omani golfers is evident from statistical data indicating the high number and multiplicity of local and international participation and the upward shift in the standard of preparation of some golf clubs. Ziyad al Zubair spoke about the importance of this change to the sport in view of the development witnessed in the Sultanate with regard to the participation and the growing interest in the sport at the local level. \nMoreover, he stressed that the current expansion witnessed in the game, both in terms of clubs and the multiplicity of practitioners, particularly from young people, calls for reconsideration and necessity to keep pace with these positive changes. Ziyad al Zubair was asked about the main challenges facing the game with regard to the game infrastructure and expansion of the fans base. \nHe clarified that although it is important to establish a sound infrastructure for the game, as is the case with all local sports, this should be accompanied by a high level of attention to the preparation of the administrative structure of the game as well. The development and upgrading of this aspect will give those in charge of the game the opportunity to participate and excel on wider circles in order to develop the game and to better support the Omani golf team capable of representing the Sultanate and participating on the international level. \nZiyad al Zubair stressed that the fan base for the game of golf is constantly growing in the Sultanate whether from local Omanis or residents in the Sultanate. This gives us further motivation and incentive to seek to achieve this ambition and to announce the Oman Golf Association. He added: \"Based on my experience in Ghala Golf Club, I can confirm that the game is gradually growing at various levels in the Sultanate. It is very important to match this development by restructuring the game management and giving it a new edge by the formation of a national team of young golfers. \nThis will allow Omani golf to take its place on the international level. The call of Ziyad al Zubair to upgrade the OGC into an Association is driven by the current development witnessed in Ghala Golf Club and the active role of the Golf Committee to develop young players and promote the game on the national level. Ziyad al Zubair expressed his desire to make Ghala Golf Club a gateway for Omani golfers and the OGC for further development and promotion of the game. \nHe also pointed out the outstanding efforts made by the late His Highness Sayyid Qais bin Tariq Al Said and his key role in the development of the game, as well as the role of His Highness Sayyid Taimur bin As'ad Al Said, President of the Ghala Golf Club, who did not spare any efforts in promoting the game and encouraging its players to participate in the various internal and external events. \nHe also praised the role of the key supporters of the game, such as His Excellency Dr. Mohammed Al Rumhy, the Minister of Oil and Gas and some of the leading institutions from the private sector. In terms of the development of Ghala Golf Club and the improvement of its facilities, Ziyad al Zubair said: \"We are transforming the club into an upto date club through the establishment of some new facilities, renovation and modernization of the course and achieving selfsufficiency as a club; then join efforts with the OGC to integrate the efforts to turn the club into a hub of golf in the Sultanate. \nWe are delighted to be working together for the development of golf among young players and to take part along with the OGC to decide the best direction in the development of the game as the OGC is affiliated with R & A the governing body of golf. Ziyad al Zubair also addressed some of the challenges facing the spread of the game and how to overcome such challenges. \nHe talked about a new plan to promote golf among young Omanis through cooperation with the OGC, stating: “We want to launch an awareness program for school students, for example, we can establish a mobile center for golf, or rather a vehicle equipped with the proper educational tools and a coach to present golf to as many youths as possible. - in line with the mobile blood banks and mobile libraries which reaches public places through mobile centers. \nWe can also establish promotional activities in shopping centers and public parks. The idea is to reach a large number of Omanis and introduce them to this wonderful sport. In terms of the possibility of hosting international tournaments and competitions, Ziyad al Zubair praised the success of the National Bank of Oman’s Golf Classic which has grown over the past few years to become the grand finale of the European Challenge Tour played here in the Sultanate at Al Mouj golf course. \nHe added: \"The green golf courses in Ghala, Al Mouaj, Muscat Hills and Rass Al Hamra will enhances the possibility of the Sultanate to host first class competitions. The OGC has hosted MENA tour (Middle East and North Africa) and the championship of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in Ghala Golf Club. We encourage them to continue to host and promote such events in the future\". He also expressed his satisfaction of the junior national team holding its summer camp in Sweden. \"I’m quite sure it was a great experience for the young players where they had the opportunity to experience golf in a new environment and with new players Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:17:35.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
