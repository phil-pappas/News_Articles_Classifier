He chooses to look forward.\n\"We were undefeated and basically we thought we were untouchable,\" said Weiss, who earned the Zellner Award as Suffolk's top lineman as a junior. \"We had the best back on Long Island with Isaiah White and a real good team.\"\nLatest HS sports stories Eastport-South Manor makes itself at home vs. Northport 'Grapple at the Garden' to take place Nov. 29 Gilligan, Peragine lead Northport over Sachem East Hirdt leads Miller Place in shutout win over East Hampton Lofgren's save preserves tie for Carle Place Longwood had won nine games in a row, including seven by 29 points or more, and the shot at a perfect season was derailed in a shocking 36-22 home playoff loss to Patchogue-Medford.\n\"The loss was numbing,\" Weiss said. \"Guys were walking around in disbelief. We beat them by five touchdowns during the season. So this year we take nothing for granted.\"\nThe Lions will meet Lindenhurst, the defending Suffolk I champion, Friday night in a battle of unbeatens at 6 p.m. These two are the top ranked teams in Suffolk, have 4-0 records, and haven't played each other since 2011.\nFootball LI's Elite 11 football teams Longwood has run roughshod over four straight opponents with an outstanding offensive line that includes tackles Weiss and Nick Castrova, guards Tyler Herrmann and Anthony Lavio and center Vincent Feliciano. Halfbacks Tahj Clark and Khalil Owens share in the glory of running behind such a dynamic front line.\nLindenhurst wins with a more balanced approach behind quarterback Ryan Hofmann, who has thrown for 11 TDs. Hofmann has three big targets in wide receivers Joe Palmeri, Jeremy Ruckert and Steven Ramirez.\nCommack gave Lindenhurst all it could handle last week in a 14-7 loss.\nOther games;\nHuntington (1-3) at Deer Park (4-0), Friday night, 6 p.m.: Huntington has lost three games to opponents with a combined 11-1 record -- the Blue Devils are better than their record would indicate. Deer Park is 4-0 against teams with a combined record of 1-15. Hmmm -- mismatch but which way. Deer Park was 6-0 in 1999 and then lost its final three games, including two to -- get ready for it -- Huntington.\nEast Meadow (2-2) at Freeport (3-1), Saturday, 2 p.m.: East Meadow ended Freeport's season, 40-20, in a first-round playoff game. The Jets like to impose their will and control the clock with a savage ground game.
