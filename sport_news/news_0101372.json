WALKER AP Sports Writer   10:56   10:56   \nPeople: Photo Gallery: \nClick to view (6 Photos) \nNASHVILLE, Tennessee â€” Craig Smith had a power-play goal as the Nashville Predators scored twice in the first period Thursday night and held off the Carolina Hurricanes 2-1 in the season opener for both. \nViktor Arvidsson scored the first goal of his NHL career, and Seth Jones had two assists in the first period. Nashville improved to 4-1-1 in its last six season openers. \nGoalie Pekka Rinne, a three-time Vezina Trophy finalist, missed his first shutout of Carolina when Eric Staal scored with 1:40 left. Rinne made 25 saves for the win. \nDefenseman Noah Hanifin, the fifth overall pick by Carolina in June, made his NHL debut. The Hurricanes lost defenseman James Wisniewski, one of their offseason additions, early to a lower-body injury, and he did not return. \nThe Predators opened the night with their traditional gold carpet walk into the arena, then they kicked off Peter Laviolette's second season as coach by jumping all over the team he coached to the 2006 Stanley Cup, taking 11 of the first 13 shots. \nThey nearly blew it with the Hurricanes finishing with a flurry of shots at Rinne, and Staal scored just after Carolina goalie Cam Ward reached the bench. \nSmith tipped in a shot by Ryan Ellis for a 1-0 lead off Nashville's first power play to take advantage of Jordan Staal's penalty for high-sticking. Smith signed a five-year deal worth $21.2 million in July. Arvidsson tipped in a shot redirected by Calle Jarnkrok off a blast from Jones at 17:03 for the 2-0 lead. The Swede celebrated his first career goal with a triple fist pump on the bench. \nCarolina came in having won its final four preseason games. The Hurricanes just couldn't get anything going against the Predators, who still aren't happy at being ousted in the first round of the playoffs last spring after finishing third in the Western Conference. \nThe Hurricanes outshot Nashville 21-11 in the final two periods and failed to convert on two power plays in the third. Except for Staal's tip-in, their flurry of shots in the final minute just couldn't squeeze past Rinne, who finished second to Montreal goalie Carey Price in Vezina voting. \nNotes: Nashville improved to 9-6-2 all-time in home openers. ... These teams split last season, but Nashville now is 10-4-0 in the last nine games in this series. The Predators also have gotten points in 11 of the last 12. ... Arvidsson led Nashville's AHL-affiliate, Milwaukee, in scoring last season. ... Carolina now is 4-9-5 in season openers since leaving Connecticut. ... Only 12 defensemen had made their NHL debut in the year they were drafted since the 2008 draft. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:52:24.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
