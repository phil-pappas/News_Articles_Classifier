He is likely to go with the left-hander Lester in Game 1 and Arrieta in Game 2, simply because the innings are piling up on Arrieta like never before and in his last outing he was not nearly as sharp as he has been. Lester will have had seven days’ rest if he pitches Saturday.\nArrieta has thrown 67 more innings this season than any previous year in his career, and there are possibly two seven-game series to go.\nLester is the Cubs’ $155 million man and would relish a Game 1 start in the NLCS, but said he would have no issues starting the second game.\nYour browser does not support iframes. Shortstop Addison Russell missed Game 4 because of a hamstring injury and will get three extra days of therapy to see if he will be ready to go. If not, backup Javier Baez — who blasted a three-run homer Tuesday night — gets the nod.\nMaddon has all his young weapons clicking, especially rookie slugger Kyle Schwarber and first baseman Anthony Rizzo. The Cubs hit nine home runs the two games at Wrigley and have a decided home-field advantage.\nIt's official: @Cubs verify that this is @kschwarb12 's home run ball: http://t.co/0nHARR9SR6 pic.twitter.com/BVUoDEuOQ6 \n— WGN TV News (@WGNNews) October 14, 2015 \n\nKnowing if they can get a split in the first two games on the road, they can close out the series in three straight games in Wrigley is a wonderful position for this talented team.\nAsked who will be the next hero for the Cubs, Maddon said during the victory celebration: “Stay tuned, man. They’ve all been playing, they are all part of the ownership group here. That’s the way it should be. I did visualize this, I’ve already visualized the next step. We’ll see how it all plays out, but you’ve got to be a little bit of a dreamer to make it all come true.’’\nKeep dreaming. Everything is coming up aces for Maddon and his Wild Card Cubs.\n  Filed under chicago cubs ,  jake arrieta ,  joe maddon ,  jon lester ,  mlb playoffs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:03:27.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
