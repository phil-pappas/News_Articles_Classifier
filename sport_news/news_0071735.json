The Pumas of Argentina thrashed Six Nations champions Ireland 43-20 earlier in Cardiff. \nAfter a disastrous weekend for European sides, two-time world champions South Africa will play defending titleholders New Zealand in the other semi-final at Twickenham on Saturday. South Africa beat Wales 23-19 while the All Blacks crushed France 62-13 on Saturday. \nAustralia’s hero was Bernard Foley as he landed a last minute penalty, contentiously awarded by South Africa referee Craig Joubert. \n“Its a penalty and that’s the way it works. You know they work both ways in all games and that’s life,” said Wallabies coach Michael Cheika. \nThe Scots came agonisingly close to reaching only their second ever semi-final, the last was in 1991. \nBut with the rain pouring down late on the fairytale ended with the last-gasp penalty. \nAll games were live on SuperSport. \n—Follow Gary on Twitter: @garyalsmith.
