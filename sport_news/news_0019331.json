It could be Sudan, or Rwanda or the Congo -- in fact, it's sad how many places it could be.\nIt's a harrowing story about a young boy -- he couldn't be more than 12 -- named Agu (Abraham Attah), whose village is overrun by government forces looking for rebels. After seeing his father and older brother gunned down before his eyes, Agu flees into the jungle and eventually falls in with a ragtag rebel band. He's one of many child soldiers under the sway of a man known only as The Commandant (Idris Elba), and he goes on to do terrible things. This is not a movie for the faint of heart.\nThe movie has garnered attention for three main reasons. It's adapted (from a novel by Uzodinma Iweala) and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, who helmed every episode of the first season of HBO's \"True Detective.\" It features a magnetically evil, humanizing performance from the always-watchable Elba. And it's the first foray by the streaming service Netflix into high-profile, Oscar-season, feature film distribution. (The movie's also being released in cinemas that don't have policies against showing movies also available on demand, including Portland's Living Room Theater.)\nFukunaga's style, alternating lyrical downbeats with operatic bursts of disturbing action, will be familiar to fans of \"True Detective\" as well as his first film, the immigration saga \"Sin Nombre.\" He also executes a couple of trademark extended tracking shots that are designed to impress, and do.\nElba perfectly captures the twisted paternal charisma of a man who initiates Agu into warfare by forcing him to execute a prisoner with a machete. He can't help but stand apart from his less seasoned cast mates, though, in a way that takes you out of the movie at times. The real star is Attah, a Ghanaian street kid plucked from obscurity, who imbues Agu with just the right mix of terror, brutality and the last remaining vestiges of boyish innocence.\nThe Oscar-nominated Canadian film \"War Witch\" covered similar ground, and was even more unsparing, but \"Beasts\" has a more compelling visual style. While it may be more convenient to view it online at home, anyone without a Paul Allen-level home theater setup will appreciate it that much more on a big screen.\n-- Marc Mohan for The Oregonian/OregonLive\n***\n\"BEASTS OF NO NATION\"\nGrade: B\nRating: R\nRunning time: 136 minutes\nPlaying at: Opens Friday, Oct. 16 at Living Room Theater and streaming on Netflix (subscription required).\nCast and crew: Idris Elba, Abraham Attah; directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga.\nThe lowdown: In an unnamed African country, a young boy becomes a child soldier in a ragtag rebel band ruled by The Commandant (Idris Elba).
