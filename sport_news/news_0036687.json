Tight end Eric Ebron (knee) and defensive tackle Haloti Ngata (calf) were full participants Thursday after being limited Wednesday and could return after missing the past two games.\nUnfortunately, running back Joique Bell (ankle) was limited Thursday after practicing fully Wednesday, so it’s unclear if he’ll be back after missing the last three games.\nLinebackers Josh Bynes (hip) and Tahir Whitehead and defensive end Jason Jones (neck) were also full participants after being limited Wednesday.\nRunning back Theo Riddick (groin) and punter Sam Martin (left knee) were both limited for the second straight day.\nFor the Vikings, defensive end Everon Griffen (illness) returned to practice fully Thursday after sitting Wednesday. Defensive tackle Shariff Floyd (knee/ankle) and defensive end Justin Trattou (foot) were out again.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:18:44.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
