Now you’ve got Anthony Bennett playing well. James (Johnson) hasn’t been able to do much because of injury and now he’s coming out of mothballs.\n“We’ve got some guys we want to look at in those rotations, not only the first unit but most importantly the second unit.”\nTo the casual observer, there would seem to be all kinds of time to figure it out but it’s more complex than some would think. The Raptors need to a better rebounding team — a key role for big men — and finding some kind of scoring balance is equally important.\nDoes Patterson stretch the floor well enough to make Valanciunas a better low post threat or does Patterson work better as a primary scorer next to the offensively-challenged Biyombo?\nCan Scola’s smarts mean the ball will move more quickly and decisively if he’s on the court with Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, or does he lack the court-spacing skills of Patterson?\nLots to work on.\n“(Casey) thinks about that a lot more than we do — we just try to play — but I feel everybody kind of feels a little out of place and things will get to normal soon,” Scola said.\nPatterson, to many the presumptive starter once Amir Johnson left, is the best shooter of the bunch but he hasn’t provided an awful lot of production in any of Toronto’s three pre-season games. Maybe he’s just getting used to the role, maybe he’s a chronic slow-starting veteran, but the Raptors need his production.\n“Pat’s a shooter,” Casey said. “He’s got one thing to do, he shouldn’t be thinking about anything else, that’s who he is. He’s one of the best shooters in the league and that’s what he has to do.\n“That’s what all our shooters have to do, shoot the ball. They have the green light.”\nThat could be the one thing that ignites the offence, some long-range shooting to loosen up defences. The Raptors haven’t been effective from long range so far and it’s a point of emphasis for the coach.\n“Not just to shoot it, but it gives the offence a rhythm,” Casey said. “Guys understand where the shots are coming from, who’s expected to shoot. And when you don’t, your spacing’s bad, you’re driving back into traffic. A lot of bad things happen when three-point shooters don’t take their shots.”\nNow they just have to figure out who’s on the court to take them.\n“We’re evaluating a lot of things, not only positions but the rotation,” Casey said.\nMore on thestar.com\nThe final five: Breaking down the Argos’ schedule", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:50:28.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
