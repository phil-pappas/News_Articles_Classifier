With the early success of the 3-on-3 overtime, I think it is time to address some other NHL rules that should be changed as quickly as next season.\nAdChoices Remove the trapezoid\nThe trapezoid in the defensive zone was created as a rule that was essentially made to neuter Martin Brodeur. It is time for the NHL to remove it ASAP. No goalie in the league plays the puck with the same fervor as Brodeur so why keep it? It is now only there to cause players to get penalties. The only players that can play the puck similarly are Ben Bishop and maybe Steve Mason, but is that enough for them to keep it? Maybe by removing it goalies will emphasize playing the puck more. Does this then bring about the thought that goalies will receive more hits as a cause of this change?\nGoal counts with stick above crossbar\nThis is obviously for the protection of the players. Regardless of this, you still get penalties often for high sticking as it is just the nature of the game. The goals that are scored from the stick above the crossbar are high-skill plays that take immense hand-eye coordination. If you want to increase scoring in the NHL, then you need to tweak the rules to allow these plays.\nAllow the hand pass\nThe concern of many is that the players will begin not using their sticks and the “integrity” of the game will be lost. I obviously wouldn’t want a closed hand pass because that does defeat the purpose of the game, but why can’t you pat the puck to your teammate? It is another way to raise the scoring in the league without changing too much to the base rules. Simplicity and common sense should be the name of the game.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:06:06.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
