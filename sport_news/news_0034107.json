There was nobody who tried to make politics... that was I think very, very important for our success,\" he said.\nTokyo's stadium fiasco has pushed back a new venue's completion date, embarrassing Japanese sport officials who have also been forced to find an alternate showpiece site for Rugby World Cup matches in 2019.\nSome have expressed concerns about Tokyo hosting the games in the summer, when the city often experiences intense heat.\nBut Masuzoe said he was confident authorities could keep athletes and spectators cool by \"spraying mist, holding a marathon race very early in the morning or paving roads with heat-absorbing technologies.\"\nThe governor's meeting with Johnson came as officials from the International Olympic Committee reviewed the ongoing preparations for the games and said they had confidence in the plans.\nAt a press conference IOC Vice President John Coates said Japanese organisers had helped \"build up the excitement around the world\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:40:48.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
