So McElwain put out a call this week to the Florida student body for a walk-on kicker, and 216 candidates applied. \"As long as they can flip it through there (the uprights), I'm good with it,\" McElwain said.\nThe winner was Dallas Stubbs, a hometown Gainesville High graduate who walked on in 2013 but was cut to make room for Powell and another kicker. \"The last time I was on the team, I felt like I didn't get much of a chance,\" Stubbs told the Gainesville Sun. \"This is just a new opportunity, brand-new coaching staff. I can't even put it into words. I went to games as a kid. Having been on the team in the past and not really having a shot, this is special for me.\"\nLes Miles protecting Leonard Fournette: Bravo for Miles sending film clips to the SEC office. Hopefully, supervisor of officials Steve Shaw saw his crews allow defenses to push Fournette back 10 yards and slam him to the ground long after plays had been blown dead. Now we'll see how this is handled the rest of the season.\nWinning debut for Shawn Elliott: Elliott, South Carolina's offensive line coach who became interim coach last week when Steve Spurrier resigned, got a 19-12 victory over Vanderbilt in his temp head coach debut. He is ecstatic his team has an open date this week. \"It (last week) was chaos, I felt like a mad man all week,\" Elliott said. \"When I laid my head down at night, a new question would pop up and I'd re-think. Never got more an hour of sleep all week until the night before the game. Then, I knew I had to get some sleep.\"\nFizzle\nAn NBA quality \"make-up call\" by Harry Ts: Last Saturday, a LSU fan and his group of 20 were turned away from Harry T's Lighthouse restaurant in Destin. Don Bass, the fan, was wearing an LSU hat when he arrived to secure tables. He was stopped at the door and was told the Emerald Coast Gator Club had reserved the restaurant. The club asked Harry T's management not to seat opposing fans. When Bass sent an e-mail to Harry T's management reporting the incident, management responded LSU fans \"don't carry a good name here\" and claimed LSU fans had \"physically attacked staff.\"\nAfter Bass' e-mail and the restaurant's response went viral this week to rile up the Tigers' faithful, many of whom vacation in Destin, Harry T's went into damage-control mode. The club announced Thursday it is staging a Geaux Game Day LSU watch party Saturday starting at 6 p.m. Fans of all teams are welcome and 50 percent of all proceeds will be donated to the LSU scholarship fund.\nForgive and forget Tiger fans? Nah, didn't think so.", "external_links": ["http://www.gatorsports.com/article/20151022/ARTICLES/151029897?tc=cr"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:29:16.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
