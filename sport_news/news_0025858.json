There has been a spurt in smuggling attempts. In the past 20 days, six attempts have been made to smuggle drugs across the border. However, all these attempts were thwarted by the BSF troops leading to the seizure of 48kg of heroin in the Punjab frontier. Sources said the basmati crop was to blame for this trend. “Some varieties of basmati grow to around five feet. This combined with one-and-half feet deep water channel made for watering fields give ample cover to the Pakistani smugglers,” they said. Sumer Singh, DIG BSF, Amritsar sector, admitted that the basmati crop provided cover to the Pakistani smugglers. “As per norms we cannot allow farmers to sow a crop that attains a height of five feet within 150 yards of the border as it hinders vision. Farmers have recently been sowing basmati crops as these get a good price,” said Sumer Singh. “On humanitarian grounds, we allow them to grow the crops as we seek to maintain good relations with local residents. However, the BSF had adopted zero tolerance policy towards smugglers,” he said He further said since Pakistani smugglers had been killed on the international border, they were not pushing the drugs through plastic pipes across the border. “They throw the drugs across the border these days. They are also using innovative way to smuggle the contraband such as making a plastic sling of heroin, etc,.” he said. Sumer said they had not only enhanced and intensified the patrolling on the border, but also installed early warning systems such as “bells” on the border. These alert the jawans when smugglers approach the fence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:11:08.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
