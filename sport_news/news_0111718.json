Mississippi State released a new video for the game, featuring the sweet sounds of Ciara‚Äôs new song, ‚ÄúPaint It, Black.‚Äù \nWear white if you‚Äôre going to the game. With blue, of course. Retweet if you're wearing Black to the game Saturday! #HailState #AllBlackEverything https://t.co/eH66hDYhwR \n‚Äî MSU Football (@HailStateFB) October 21, 2015 \nConfession: I like that song. Article written by Drew Franklin I can recite every line from Forrest Gump, blindfolded.

Can she sue the Roling Stones for ripping her off? Dieter October 22, 2015 at 5:06   \nWatching other teams‚Äô pump up stuff makes me so thankful for KY Wildcats TV. They produce much more diverse and engaging content than most other similar outfits around the country. 8 god October 22, 2015 at 5:51   \nClever with the line about the sea of blue or whatever. DylanG October 22, 2015 at 5:52   \nThat song should NEVER be covered. Rolling Stones should sue her ass. Aukfandude October 22, 2015 at 6:38   \nAnybody else scared we will lose by 21+? Losing to a bad Auburn team at home and almost losing to Eastern. Our D has looked bad lately and mobile qb‚Äôs hurt us every time. Not feeling confident about this one. Ha!

You will be searching for a coach very soon 3. That coach will also be owned by Calipari (I see UCLA-type beat downs in your future) \nThanks for visiting. Have a nice next couple of years. üòâ \n#LittleBrothel Aukfandude October 22, 2015 at 7:21 pm | Permalink \nI am a UK fan. Why does everyone with any negative comment have to be a non fan? Just think were outmatched n this one and its a road game. Is everyone that way on here? Ha! October 22, 2015 at 8:21 pm | Permalink \nTypical troll response. Just save it, bro. \n#L1C4nicate October 22, 2015 at 6:58   \nWe‚Äôre everyone‚Äôs Superbowl‚Ä¶?
