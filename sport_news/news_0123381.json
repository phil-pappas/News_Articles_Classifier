They found their swagger and their attitude as they beat their favorite foes, the San Francisco 49ers, 20-3. \nFor the Hawks, the win was desperately needed. At 3-4 they still have a playoff heartbeat but clearly still have a lot of work and a lot more winning to do. Here are my takeaways from this win. Puking, stiff arms, big runs… that’s why we call him Beast. What I Liked \nThe Beast, Marshawn Lynch , was back. He was running hard, throwing stiff arms, running through blocks, and puking. We definitely saw it all, and then some, from Lynch. He was the featured man on the Seahawks opening drive of the game that went for a Seattle TD. \nLynch kept running hard and finished with 20+ carries and 100+ yards. Both are the kind of numbers that usually add up to a Seahawks victory and they did once again. \nThe Seahawks defense was masterful at handling the 49ers. Colin Kaepernick could not get into any kind of rhythm throwing the ball as they sacked him four times in the first half alone. The defense continued the onslaught in the second half and got to Kaepernick a total of six times in the game. The 49ers punted eight times. \nI was looking for Tyler Lockett to do something spectacular in this one and I got my wish. I thought it would come on special teams but I will take a 40+ yard Russell Wilson bomb to Lockett without an argument. Lockett was so open on the play it just looked too easy. That’s the kind of talent and speed he has. What I didn’t like \nThere were not many penalties in this one but the few that went against the Seahawks seemed particularly painful. JR Sweezy gets my vote for the worst penalty in the game. His leg whip in the Seahawks second half opening drive pretty much destroyed a promising drive. \nThe Seahawks played better offensively in this game but they are not the kind of offense that can play past mistakes like that. \nDespite the win, this was not a good night for Russell Wilson . His two interceptions were both in the “really bad” category as far as his decision making is concerned. Both times his receivers were covered by two or more defenders. There was no need to force either of those throws and keep the 49ers hopes alive. Wilson needs to make better decisions when he takes his deep shots. \nHow many weeks in a row can the Seahawks continue to give up big pass plays to their opponent’s tight ends in the seam? It just keeps happening over and over. \nWhat is it with the communication on defense that prevents it? Every time it happens, the Seahawks defenders start pointing at each other. I’m sick of it and it needs to get fixed. \nThe Seahawks scored a TD in the red zone in the first quarter. They didn’t do it again the rest of the game. I love that Steven Hauschka has been so good and so perfect this year kicking field goals but the Seahawks need to score seven with more regularity. \nWhat I Really Didn’t Like \nThe Seahawks really didn’t finish this game in the way I wanted it. Yes, they won, but they had a couple of opportunities to put the game away with a touchdown and didn’t do it. They only wound up scoring a total of three points in the 4 th quarter. \nThree points is not a knockout punch. The Seahawks have been talking about finishing. The offense needs to finish with that big, nail in the coffin touchdown, late in games. \nLooking Ahead \nThe Seahawks get the long week now to get ready for the Cowboys in Dallas. If they can win there and even their record at 4-4 things start to look a bit brighter. They’ll get a bye week after the Cowboys followed by five of their last eight games at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:22:31.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
