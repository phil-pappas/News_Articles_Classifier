The Tigers defense should pose a more formidable task this week. I think this has chance to be a very entertaining game, but I think Southern Columbia’s size and depth wears down an undermanned Mount Carmel squad. SCA 42, MCA 28. Wyalusing Valley at Danville: The Ironmen’s tour of the top backs in District 4 continues tonight. After taking on Marty Clark, Kyle Kayrcki and the Southern Columbia backfield so far this season, the Rams’ Luke Jennings (751 yards, 7 touchdowns) now visits. Wyalusing out-muscled Danville last year, but this a different Ironmen team. Danville 28, Wyalusing 21. North Penn at Warrior Run: If either team holds any hope of grabbing a district berth, this is a must-win game. Both teams enter at 2-3, but the Defenders did a great job against the North Penn offense a year ago. Brock Burleigh has thrown for 1,330 yards and 20 touchdowns, but the Panthers have allowed 103 points in their last three games, all losses. Warrior Run 35, North Penn 32. Shikellamy at Central Mountain: This might the biggest question mark game of the week. Injuries to the Braves’ Shawn Turber and Wildcats’ Justin Neff have them both in danger of missing a second straight week, something that hinders both teams’ ability to hit a big play. I think Shikellamy grinds out a victory and gets back into the district playoff hunt. Shikellamy 14, Central Mountain 7. Lewisburg at Central Columbia: The Green Dragons haven’t allowed a point in 10 quarters, and the Blue Jays have struggled to score. Lewisburg keeps rolling. Lewisburg 28, Central Columbia 0. Mifflinburg at Selinsgrove: The Seals survived a trip to Crispin Field last week and must travel to Montoursville next week. Selinsgrove can’t look past the winless Wildcats, who have the potential to break out at any time. Selinsgrove 35, Mifflinburg 14. Milton at Montoursville: The Black Panthers were locked in a two-point struggle last week against Shamokin, but injuries and Indians tailback Preston Burns played a big role in a 24-0 second half of Shamokin’s 41-19 win. Things don’t get any easier this week. Montoursville 28, Milton 7. Shamokin at Jersey Shore: The Bulldogs bounced back from their first loss in 16 regular season games with a rout of Mifflinburg last week. The Indians hope to do a better job of controlling Jersey Shore’s running game than they did last when Levi Lorson carried the ball 49 times for 246 yards and three scores last season. Jersey Shore 27, Shamokin 10. Line Mountain at Halifax: The Eagles have struggled early on and injuries certainly haven’t helped matters. Halifax has lost four in a row, but has enough weapons to pull this one out. Line Mountain has an easier schedule down the stretch and picks up its first win here. Line Mountain 18, Halifax 7. \nEast Juniata at Millersburg: The Indians have one of the most explosive players in the area in Christian Wingard. Depth has been an issue though. George Miskinis has East Juniata playing well — despite back-to-back losses to Newport and Juniata. I just have a feeling about an upset. East Juniata 21, Millersburg 20.
