After Lowell goalie Kevin Boyle made a spectacular diving save on Chris LeBlanc, the River Hawks quickly turned it back up ice and caught the Merrimack D out of position too deep in the attacking zone. C.J. Smith broke in alone on Collin Delia and beat him with a backhand on the breakaway. \nIt would be the only time they would find a way to solve Delia all night. \n“You score first, you’re 100 percent on the penalty kill, those are the positives,” said Lowell head coach Norm Bazin. “Downside is you get outshot 2-to-1 and you can’t get that second goal when it counts. We have a lot to improve upon, but it wasn’t a total disaster by any means. … We did some things offensively but not enough to generate enough scoring opportunities.” \nMerrimack outshot Lowell 35-15, including 30-13 after the start of the second period. \nAs the shot numbers indicate, the Warriors were effective at keeping the River Hawks to the outside on most of their chances in the zone. Lowell also rarely entered the attacking zone on odd-man rushes, with the Warriors neutralizing their attack with a lot of dump-ins as opposed to zone entries with possession. \n“We like to separate guys from pucks in the middle of the rink,” Merrimack head coach Mark Dennehy said. “You have twice as good a chance of scoring a goal if you carry it in as opposed to dumping it in. … The game is about transition and getting defensemen who can break the puck out, and we’re better at that now.” \nAdded Bazin, “There was pressure on both sides, but not enough pressure on our part. I didn’t think our urgency was strong enough in all three zones. Sometimes if you’re not aggressive enough, they’re coming down your throat. That seemed to be the case in a lot of instances.” \nShots after the first period were just 5-2 Merrimack and the Warriors surrendered the only goal. Dennehy thought his team improved markedly after that. \n“In the first period we were getting overplayed a lot,” he said. :They were getting pucks and flying them by us. They do a great job of owning the inside of the rink. We need to support the puck and then just chip it, because they won’t give you the middle of the rink.” \n#7 Lowell 1, #19 Merrimack 1 \nat Lawler Arena, Merrimack College \nLowell (3-0-1): 1-0-0-0—1 \nFirst Period: 1.
