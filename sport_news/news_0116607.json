Thor helped police track 30-year-old Darien Greenwood near Interstate 12 and Highway 59 in a barn after an hours-long search. He jumped from from a pile of debris and tried to attack a deputy, officers said. When Thor tried to intervene, the suspect stabbed the dog in the neck and shoulder with a switchblade.\nDeputies shot Greenwood, who later died at an area hospital. Another person, Dean Perkins, was also arrested.\nDoctors performed emergency surgery Tuesday night and had to perform a blood transfusion due to the amount of blood Thor lost.\nAnother surgery was performed Wednesday around noon. There was only one skin wound, but a lot of muscle damage according to the STPSO.\nThor has been on active duty for two years.\nThe rally will be held at the Justice Center in downtown Covington from noon until 12:30 p.m. Everyone is welcome to attend.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
