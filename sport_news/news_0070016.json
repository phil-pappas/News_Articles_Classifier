Waynesville took a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first on a two-run home run by Morgan Loggins, but the Eagles put runners on second and third after a hit batter and a double by Makenzie Goswick. The next batter hit a long fly ball to left field and it went off the glove of the fielder to score a run. A fielder's choice during the next at-bat scored a run and Adrienne Myers slapped a liner down the third-base line to give Joplin a 3-2 lead. Then Waynesville's Jordan Thormeyer and Joplin's Michaela Sennett settled in for a while. In the top of the seventh, the Eagle's Cortney Krolman led off with a single and a sacrifice bunt moved her over. Lauren Rader hit a soft grounder to the Waynesville's Macalah Danielsen at short and Danielsen quickly fired to third. The throw was on time to catch Krolman, but the third-baseman dropped the ball in the act of tagging her. Goswick singled to center to score Krolman to give Joplin a 4-2 lead. The Tigers were able to score Emily Lucitt after an error put her on base and Jordan Thormeyer scored her on a single, but that's all they would get in the bottom of the frame. \"We were where we needed to be, at the heart of our lineup,\" Jackson said. \"They put the ball in play and that's all we can do.\" Thormeyer takes the loss for Waynesville. She worked all seven innings and gave up four runs (three earned) on six hits and a hit batter. \"Jordan Thormeyer threw a great game,\" Jackson said. \"Joplin has a strong offensive team and she held them to four runs. I don't think they've been held, too many times, to four runs.\" In 29 games, it has happened just eight times. In fact, Joplin averages over seven runs per game. Jackson said should Thormeyer pitch as well as she did Monday during the Class 4 District 10 tournament that starts on Wednesday in Waynesville, she feels good about their chances of moving on. \"If [Thormeyer] throws like she did tonight, we should have no trouble with Lebanon (on Wednesday),\" Jackson said. \"However, Lebanon put nine runs on the board against us last time we played them. We can't take any team lightly, we need to come out playing hard, hitting the ball hard against Lebanon and hopefully we can get past them and meet Camdenton.\" Page 2 of 2 - The Lady Tigers may have to do so without their No. 4 hitter, senior Jordan Kane, who sustained a concussion on Saturday during the Rolla Tournament while diving for a ground ball. Kane passed concussion testing initially, but started having concussion-like symptoms again Sunday, so Jackson said she isn't sure of her status for Wednesday's game. \"I have no idea,\" Jackson said. \"I'm not sure if they went to the doctor today, I know she didn't come to school. So, I guess we'll just wait to hear what happens.\" Waynesville's game against Lebanon will be at 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday.
