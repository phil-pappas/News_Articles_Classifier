For me as a manager when you reach the final you have done fantastic.\n\"I think in the Champions League you need to win all your home matches otherwise it will be very difficult.\"\nWhether or not he were to win it again, Van Gaal does not envisage staying on once his contract expires in 2017.\n\"Normally I leave after next year, but nothing in football is normal,\" he said.\n\"But I promised my wife to go to our (Portuguese) paradise and it would be hard to break that promise. If I stay a year longer it will be very hard for my wife.\"\nMidfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, a former Champions League winner with Bayern Munich, agreed that United have the potential to emulate his former club.\n\"This squad has that strength,\" he said.\n\"The whole club are very friendly and my team mates made it easy. Of course no-one speaks German but that was no problem for me and I feel very comfortable here especially when you have matches here at Old Trafford.\n\"It is a big honour for me to play here, especially in the Champions League.\"\n\"He is already accepted as a leading player,\" Van Gaal said of the German World Cup winner.\n\"That is why we bought him from Bayern Munich. He is an example for the young players and I'm very happy with him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:17:20.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
