Everything was going the wrong way for the Flyers. The Bruins were about to make it 5-2, but Steve Mason - in relief of Neuvirth - made a sprawling save across the crease, robbing David Pastrnak of a goal. The play was reviewed, but it was deemed Mason kept the puck from crossing the goal line. \nAnd that's all the momentum the Flyers needed to turn the game on its side and escape with a 5-4, overtime victory on Claude Giroux's second goal of the game. \n\"It was a big moment,\" Mason said. \"But at the same time, those are things that I expect of myself and what the team expects from the goaltenders. It turns out that in tonight's game it kick-started things, and it's a good thing. \n\"Sometimes it always doesn't shake out that way, but you definitely hope that it can provide some momentum. (Goalies) can't go out there and provide a big hit or fight or score goals. Goaltenders making timely saves are kind of their way of chipping in. Fortunately, tonight it went our way.\" \nA minute and 14 seconds after Mason's save, Giroux took advantage of a turnover by Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask to cut the deficit to 4-3, with 12 minutes, 12 seconds left in the game. \nLess than three minutes later, Wayne Simmonds came streaking down the left wing and fired a wrist shot just under the crossbar and high over the left shoulder of Rask, squaring the score. \nThe Flyers salvaged a point and got the game to overtime. But then they got more. \nAfter Michael Del Zotto was taken down, the Flyers went on a four-on-three power play. Mark Streit, quarterbacking the top of the power play, fed a pass over to Giroux, who rocketed a one-timer past Rask to get the Flyers two points. \n\"That's the kind of team we want to be,\" Giroux said. \"We want to work hard. The first two periods, that just wasn't the case.\" \nRinaldo was given a five-minute charging major and a game misconduct at the end of the first period. The Flyers, however, got no shots through to Rask during the five-minute power play that ensued. \n\"That was a horrible power play,\" Simmonds said. \"I think that's the worst power play that we've had in the last (four) years since I've been here.\" \nThe Bruins took advantage, getting their go-ahead goal shorthanded when a twice-deflected shot from Loui Eriksson found the skate of Chris Kelly and snuck through Mason. Just over four minutes later, Jimmy Hayes surged down the right wing and snuck a shot between Mason and the left post for a 4-2 lead with 11 minutes, 11 seconds left in the second period. \nWhen the first 40 minutes came to an end, two points looked far away. \n\"Not a lot of things went right but we didn't have a very good period,\" Hakstol said of the second. \"The guys went in the room, regrouped and came out with a real good mentality, and that's most important. \n\"I felt like we had energy right away in the third period. I thought our intentions were good right away. And when 'Mase' made that save, it jacked it up a couple of notches.\" \nThe Flyers struck first in the first period as Pierre-Edouard Bellemare gathered his own rebound after accepting a pass from Chris VandeVelde and snuck a backhander past Rask. The Bruins equalized exactly four minutes later, capitalizing on an egregious Giroux turnover to even the score at one. Giroux skated behind his own net and threw a no-look, backhanded pass toward no one in particular, and the Bruins made him pay. \nSam Gagner, who was initially going to be a healthy scratch before Brayden Schenn was sidelined before the game, quickly gave the Flyers a 2-1 lead with five minutes to play in the first. But then Patrice Bergeron - whose wife Stephanie gave birth to their first child before the game - tied the score with a power-play goal after Giroux was whistled for a four-minute, high-sticking penalty. Neuvirth caught Bergeron's stick in the mask, and that's what appeared to cause his injury. \nShortly after, Rinaldo did something Rinaldo-like. And the Flyers finally found their revenge in the form of a crazy, come-from-behind win with a short bench. \nThey can thank Mason. \n\"He made that save there . . . he saved our bacon,\" Simmonds said. \"I think that was the turning point in the third period. After that we were going full speed ahead. I think we knew, we kind of said something to each other on the bench that we couldn't let that save go to waste.\" \nAnd they didn't.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:42:57.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
