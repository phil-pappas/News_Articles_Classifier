Yes, mercifully, we are only six days away from games that actually count.\nBut before we get to the serious part of the NBA schedule, let’s take a look back at the preseason. And, oh, were there some memorable moments for the Nets.\nHere are the five I’ll take with me.\n5. Jahlil Okafor finds Nerlens Noel for an alley-oop. OK, it wasn’t exactly a Nets moment when the young Sixers combined for the all-too-rare big-man alley-oop. \nBut it did occur in Brooklyn on Sunday, and it just so happened to be the most exciting play in any Nets preseason game.\n4. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson reacts to Beyonce. The streaming music service Tidal had a concert at Barclays Center on Tuesday night. \nAfter the show, a photo began circulating on social media: It was Beyonce, posing in front of Hollis-Jefferson’s locker, nameplate and all.\nAfter Wednesday’s practice, when a reporter showed Hollis-Jefferson the photo, he immediately said \"Oh, my God!\" and started looking for teammates to show. Minutes later, the 20-year-old rookie still was grinning.\n3. Nets change court design. The Nets debuted a subtle, but pretty cool tweak to their court. The baselines still say \"Brooklyn Nets,\" but now those words are painted in the style of subway tiles.\nIt’s a nice touch — one the NBA used during February’s All-Star weekend — one that goes well with the herringbone-patterned court, which is the only one of its kind in the NBA.\n2. Mikhail Prokhorov leads drills. After a practice at training camp, the Nets’ billionaire owner grabbed a microphone and began spreading the wealth … in the form of teaching Tibetan martial arts.\nThis included juggling and doing pushups with all four extremities balanced atop balls, and much more. \nProkhorov explained he’s been doing the exercises \"minimum two hours a day, every day, for the last maybe five-and-a-half-years, non-stop.\" \nIf it works for Prokhorov, maybe it’ll work for the Nets.\n1. Joe Johnson coins new Nets slogan: On media day, Johnson expressed surprise that Deron Williams would agree to a buyout. \"It’s not that bad here,\" Johnson said. \nThe Nets have had many slogans since moving to Brooklyn, including: \"Hello, Brooklyn\" and \"We’re In\" and \"We Are Brooklyn\" and \"Represent Brooklyn.\" But Johnson may have unintentionally coined the best one of all: \"It’s not that bad here.\"\nWe’ll have to see if it lasts through the 82 games that count.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:01:00.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
