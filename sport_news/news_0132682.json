But you talk about this team going 5-0, something that hasn't been done since 1988, the last time the team went to the Superbowl. Even last week when we were out here after the game there was talk about a Superbowl after the 4-0 start. And that talk continues with fans who went into the game and those who stayed outside the stadium. The next two games for the Bengals are on the road, next week Buffalo and the week after in Pittsburgh. We had some fans tell us on Sunday, before the season, no intentions on making a road trip to Buffalo, but after this start the packing begins for next week.
