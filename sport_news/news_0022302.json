Last month, Ford's compact Escape sold 28,474 units, nearly three times the 10,262 midsize Edge models that went out the door.\nOver at Chevrolet, the compact Equinox crossover had sales of nearly a quarter-million in 2014, making it the second-best-selling Chevy behind the Silverado pickup.\nSo, why are these little guys such big business?\nThey are cheaper and easier on gas, for openers. And for singles and pre- or post-children couples that don't need the midsizer's greater capacity, that's a compelling point.\n\"Those people are asking why they should spend all that money when they don't need all that room,\" said industry analyst Joseph Phillippi, president of Auto Trends Consulting.\nWhile cost is a factor, Phillippi suggests it is hardly the only reason small crossovers \"are very popular with the ladies.\" He thinks that women also like the idea that for an affordable price they can get the security of all-wheel-drive, all the safety features, that lofty SUV perch, and a vehicle that's more practical than a small sedan and doesn't look like one.\nThey can also get all the electronic bells and whistles, an availability that Phillippi calls \"the democratization of technology.\"\nGiven that the Equinox is cash-register royalty - more than a million sold in North America between 2010 and 2014 - it shouldn't be too surprising that Chevy wants to keep it that way. To that end, it has given the Equinox a fairly extensive sprucing up for 2016. The updating (the authentic automotive gibberish is a \"mid-cycle refresh\") includes new styling fore and aft, and fresh design elements inside with upgraded materials and electronics.\nThe 2016 starts at $22,600 for the base L model, and gets more costly as you move up through the hierarchy, which consists of the L, LS, LT, and LTZ. The LT I tested started at $26,450.\nThe tester was fitted with front drive, a 2.4-liter four that developed 182 horsepower, and a 6-speed automatic gearbox. The Equinox also can be equipped with all wheel drive, and GM's 3.6-liter, direct-injected V-6, which produces 301 horsepower in this application.\nPredictably, the tester's four-banger wasn't the stoplight terror the V-6 is, but it got me onto I-95 and the Schuylkill Expressway in lively enough fashion, and did so in a rather Scroogish way. (It had sippy-cup EPAs of 22 m.p.g. city and 32 m.p.g. highway.)\nThe stylish Equinox proved good company. It had a handsome black-and-white interior with chrome accents, supportive seats, and a dashboard that featured easy-to-read instruments and controls that fell readily to hand. The only interior downside was a surplus of hard plastic surfaces.\nThe Equinox is roomy for a compact, partly because it's quite tall. That roof height affords headroom befitting an NBA frontcourt denizen and also bumps up cargo volume.\nThe generous head and legroom persists in the backseat. Cargo space behind that seat is a useful 31.4 cubic feet. Drop the seat and the volume more than doubles to 63.7 cubic feet.\nOn the road, the Equinox displayed adequate power, competent handling, a reasonably supple ride, and low noise levels. The engine didn't get uncivil, even when flogged.\nThe Equinox can be equipped with 46 LTE connectivity, WiFi hot spot and blind spot, forward collision, and land-departure alerts.\nalhaasauto@aol.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:22:45.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
