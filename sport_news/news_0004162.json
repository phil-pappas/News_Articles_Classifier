Comment Follow @@kyleR_sports Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 9:30 AM After suffering through four straight losses, the Ascension Catholic Bulldogs have turned things around and won back-to-back games for the first time this season. Ascension Catholic opened the year with a 53-25 victory over Catholic of Pointe Coupee, but then hit a four-game skid. In this tough stretch, the Bulldogs were forced to play a 2A team in Dunham and three teams in the Class 1A top 12 in Central Catholic, Southern Lab and White Castle The results were not very good as they lost all four games by a combined margin of 192-74. They were finally able to turn things around when they hosted parish and district rival Ascension Christian. The Bulldogs featured some new wrinkles on offense as backup quarterback Javon Yarbrough took over as the starter. DC Mattingly--who started the season at quarterback--moved to wide receiver. The results were overwhelmingly positive as Yarbrough threw for 156 yards and two scores against the Lions, and Mattingly had 88 yards receiving and a touchdown. Kaleb Winchester had a jaw-dropping game as he amassed an amazing 218 yards and three scores on just six carries for a ridiculous 36-yard average. He also added a receiving touchdown. The result was a 48-0 shutout victory by Ascension Catholic that finally put them back in the win column and also earned them their first district victory of the season. Their strong play carried over to last Friday night's matchup as they hit the road to play winless East Iberville. The game was never remotely competitive. Ascension Catholic exploded for 49 first-half points. Their defense was stout as well as they pitched two more quarters of shutout football. In the second half, the Bulldogs put things in cruise control. East Iberville finally got on the board to deprive Ascension Catholic of a second straight shutout, but the Bulldogs came away with the dominating 62-6 victory. In their back-to-back district wins, Ascension Catholic has outscored their opponents by a combined margin of 110-6. The Bulldogs now stand at 3-4 overall and 2-2 in district play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:07:32.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
