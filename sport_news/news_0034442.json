Sherman did not indicate any concern over missing the game when he met with reporters before practice on Tuesday but his situation is obviously one to watch as Thursday night’s game at San Francisco nears. \nListed as limited was OT Garry Gilliam (ankle) an upgrade from Monday when he was out. \nEverybody else on the team was listed as a full participant, a list that somewhat surprisingly includes CB Marcus Burley, who had surgery a week ago Thursday to repair a broken thumb. Burley had been listed as out for the game on Monday with coach Pete Carroll saying he would not play until Nov. 1 against Dallas. But those plans appear to have changed and Burley may be available against the 49ers. \nCarroll will speak to the media for a final time on Wednesday before the team flies to the Bay Area for Thursday night’s game. \nAlso listed as a full participant was MLB Bobby Wagner, who told reporters before practice that he intends to play against the 49ers. \n\nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bcondotta .
