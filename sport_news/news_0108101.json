It just takes time. Nothing happens quickly, you've always got to work for it.''\nShelton said critics have always questioned his worth in the beginning.\n\"It's the same thing, like I was in high school and college, I always had these doubters and you just have to have the faith that you're going to make plays that help turn the program around,'' he said. \"It's just a matter of time.''\nDrafted high to help shore up the Browns' 32nd-ranked run defense, Shelton takes personally that it's still last in the NFL heading into Sunday's game against the Rams.\n\"I mean, definitely it hurts me,'' he said. \"If I was able to play linebacker or safety, it'd hurt me also. But I play nose tackle and so all I can do is just do my job and count on my defensive ends and my linebackers and safeties to do their jobs.\n\"It really doesn't play into a part whose fault is it or whatever. It's a team sport and so we all have to take that jump and we all have to take the fault for that.''\nGearing up to face rookie running back Todd Gurley -- picked No. 10 overall -- Shelton acknowledged t hat he's not popping off the film yet like defensive coordinator Jim O'Neil challenged him to do two weeks ago. Last week, he played a season-low 25 snaps, but largely because the Browns were in the nickel for most of the game.\n\"Personally, I haven't done what I want to do yet,'' Shelton said. \"That's just me transitioning from college, but at the same time it's just me trying to do too much. \"(It's) just not really focusing on technique, my eyes are in the backfield or whatever. I just have to continue to focus.''\nHe acknowledged that the adjustment to playing only about a third of the game has been the hardest. At Washington, he played mostly every snap and stayed in the flow of the game. Here, he's struggling with the constant stops and starts, and with all the standing around on the sidelines until the base defense goes back out. With teams playing three wide receivers a lot, Shelton sometimes loses his edge on the sidelines.\n\"I came from college where I'm on the field nonstop, so to be out here and to be just ready for whatever series, that's what I'm trying to transition in,'' he said. \"I feel like I'm doing a great job just working with Weave (defensive line coach Anthony Weaver) and him helping me understand and also working with Xavier Cooper and Nate Orchard, just talking about how everything is going as far as being a rookie.''\nShelton, who's received only one positive grade this season from profootballfocus.com -- for the Oakland game -- hasn't talked to the coaches about his playing time.\n\"This week is going to be a heavy run team, so I'm expecting to see more of the field,'' he said. \"Each game we're going to have a different package, so I'm just going to be ready whenever coach (O'Neil) or coach (Weavet have me up).''\nShelton is certain he can make an impact if the coaches choose to play him in the nickel or dime. When the Browns drafted him, they insisted he'd be an every down player.\n \"Definitely,'' he said. \"You've got to have that confidence. When I get a chance to get out there, I'm going to have that mindset, that I'm going to make a stop and help the team win.\n \"I just have to continue to work and continue to make plays when I'm in there and that's not a problem for me. I want to get more reps, but at the same time, I want to do what's best for the team.''\nBut the coaches haven't spelled out what he needs to do to get on the field in sub-defenses.\n\"It's the packages and we just have an awesome depth chart,'' said Shelton. \"The guys that we have on the team, you can't really minus reps for them to put another guy in. So it's really just believing in the system and trusting (the coaches).''\nHe said he's not discouraged by how his season has gone so far.\n\"Not at all,'' he said. \"I have complete trust in the coaches and I know that they'll put me in the right direction.''\nShelton was asked if he gets frustrated by the impact that second-year Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, the No. 13 overall pick, is making for his team. Donald has 29 tackles, including 18 solo. He also has 3.5 sacks and 13 quarterback pressures. Shelton is tied for 12th on the team with 14 tackles, including five solo. He also has one tackle for a loss.\n\"He's a different type of player, and he's awesome,'' said Shelton. \"He's a monster when it comes to playing defensive tackle. He just has that explosive touch, explosive twitch. You just can't really be mad at the guy. He's a guy who has great work ethic and all you can do is just watch his film and learn from it.''\nHe said he never would've believed that the Browns would be last in run defense at seven games into the season, with an average yield of 149.8 yards a game.\n\"Not at all,'' he said. \"Every team expects to be the best and during training camp we had a great month of training and we definitely expected to be greater than we are right now. And it's not going to slow us down at all. We're just going to continue to come with the right mindset and continue to just battle.''\nShelton knows he'll have to be on point Sunday against Gurley, who leads all NFL running backs with a 5.7-yard average. In each of the past two games, Gurley has had a 50-yard run, and has rushed for 146 yards and 159 yards, respectively.\n \"He's freaking awesome,'' he said. \"I'm a fan. He's a guy that's going to work hard. I love going against backs that aren't going to go down after the first hit.''\nCoach Mike Pettine acknowledged that the running game \"is a source of frustration'' and \"that it's probably the biggest issue that we deal with here.'' He called for the defense to step it up this week and acknowledged that the Rams \"are certainly going to see this as a matchup of their strength against our weakness, and we are well aware of that.''\nShelton is determined to push through the rookie wall and pick up the intensity in St. Louis.\n\"It's basically the end of a college season,'' he said. \"It's basically time for me to mature and be a professional, so I'm really focusing on just taking care of my body and being ready to play the rest of the weeks the season has for us.\"\nShelton has received plenty of encouragement from veterans such as Desmond Bryant.\n\"The speed of the game's a lot faster,'' said Bryant. \"The nuances of the defense are a lot more difficult. The offensive blocking schemes that they throw at you are a lot more complex, so there's definitely a learning curve, but I think he's done a good job so far. We're all here to stop the run. As much as Danny might want to think so, the whole burden is not on his back. It's on all of our backs.\n\"He can be playing the best that's ever been played at that position and our defense could still be where it is, so he can't put that all on himself.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:08:10.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
