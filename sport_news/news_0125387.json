We've served up a fair share of the criticism over the years. But in the case of Natasha Felix, it seems the agency has been overprotective. It's time for the agency to back off.\nThe Tribune's Bonnie Miller Rubin reported Wednesday on Felix, who has been stuck in a two-year legal battle with DCFS. In July 2013, Felix let her three children, then ages 11, 9 and 5, along with a 9-year-old cousin, play at a park adjacent to her Chicago apartment building. She kept an eye on them from a bathroom window that overlooks the playground.\nSomeone at the playground called the DCFS hotline to report that the children appeared to be unsupervised. A few days later, DCFS sent an investigator to Felix's home to interview the children. The investigator, according to court documents, found that the 11-year-old boy was mature enough to handle going to a park by himself. Felix said she was home the whole time the children were playing and checked on the kids from the window about every 10 minutes.\nYou'd think the case would end there. It did not.\nDuring the home visit, the investigator learned that the 11-year-old has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a diagnosis that is centered on the ability to focus on tasks. That was a factor in convincing DCFS that Felix should be cited for child neglect on the basis of inadequate supervision.\nFelix challenged the finding. A Cook County Circuit Court judge upheld the decision by DCFS and the case is now before the Illinois Appellate Court.\n\"In my heart, I just don't feel like I did anything wrong,\" Felix told the Tribune.\nMothers continue to struggle with a lack of state funding Mothers continue to struggle with a lack of state funding. Oct. 7, 2015. (WGN-TV) Mothers continue to struggle with a lack of state funding. Oct. 7, 2015. (WGN-TV) See more videos Now, we weren't in the park. We didn't talk to the kids. We understand how difficult it is for a caseworker or investigator to make a decision on the welfare of children when there's an allegation of abuse or neglect. Make the wrong call, and kids get hurt. Sometimes badly hurt.\nIt's hard to see, though, why this case — children playing in a park next to their home, no one was harmed — has persisted.\n\"These were not kids being left in a crack house with no food,\" said Felix's attorney, Diane Redleaf, a lawyer and director of the Chicago-based Family Defense Center.\nRedleaf's organization released a report in August titled, \"When Can Parents Let Children Be Alone?\" It documents what it contends are over-the-top cases of government intervention into parenting practices that were once considered acceptable, such as letting younger kids walk to school alone or sit in a car while Mom runs into the grocery store.\n\"We don't want the state second-guessing parents like that,\" Redleaf said.\nChicago mother wages 2-year fight against child neglect citation Bonnie Miller Rubin Two years ago, Natasha Felix's three children were outside playing at a playground next to her East Ukrainian Village apartment while she was at home.\nShe was checking on her sons — then ages 11, 9 and 5 — by looking out the window every 10 minutes, she said.

But when a passer-by saw the Felix...\n(Bonnie Miller Rubin) Her group is asking the state to tighten its definition of what is considered inadequate supervision. She said a clearer standard would reduce the number of interventions into cases such as this one.\nWell, maybe. Investigators do need discretion to make these kinds of calls. The courts and the legislature should be wary of tying the hands of child protective workers when they evaluate allegations of neglect, unless there's a clear pattern of mistakes being made in this state.\nIf letting the kids play at a park next to your home is the standard for neglect, a lot of Chicago-area parents would be guilty. Standards change — parents of a certain age will recall when they were kids, before car seats and seat belt laws and bike helmets, when they roamed the neighborhood until they were called home for dinner.\nAttorneys for DCFS have requested a delay on the next court date in Felix's case. The two sides are talking. Let's hope they can make this go away, remove the finding against Natasha Felix and let her go on with raising her children.\n Editorials Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615af17/turbine/ct-mothers-struggle-state-funding-budget-battle-video-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56159c59/turbine/ct-dcfs-child-unsupervised-edit-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56151587/turbine/ct-child-neglect-inadequate-supervision-law-met-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:03:38.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
