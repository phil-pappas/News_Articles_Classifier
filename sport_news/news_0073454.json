He apologized Monday to the entire Rutgers community , ahead of Saturday’s game at Indiana.\nThe school has hired outside counsel to put together a report investigating whether the football program committed any NCAA violations.\nRutgers declined a request to make Board of Governors chairperson Greg Brown and Rutgers president Robert Barchi available for interview. Brown seldom grants media interviews, while Barchi more commonly answers questions after board meetings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:24:07.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
