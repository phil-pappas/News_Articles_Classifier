And they aren't exactly ideal for the players. \nYou know, them! \n\"Sunday is the players' day off, and it's tough sometimes, getting back to their dorms at 3 or 4 in the morning from a road trip,'' Stanford coach David Shaw said. \n\"This is the day they have to catch up on schoolwork and spend the day away from football, and they're in bed until 1 (p.m.) and half their day is gone. It's hard to recover from a night game if there are things you need to get done.\" \nThe Pac-12 is paid handsomely by ESPN and Fox ($3 billion over 12 years) in exchange for the right to broadcast games in the late window -- it's the only major conference available for that time slot. \nThere is no cap on the number of night games each Pac-12 team can play, but frustration with the schedule is growing. \nUCLA coach Jim Mora isn't happy with back-to-back Thursday night games, while Arizona is filing a formal complaint with the conference over an 8 p.m. kickoff at Washington on Oct. 31 with a road game the following week. Advertisement \n\"It's ridiculous,'' Wildcats coach Rich Rodriguez said. \nThe answer isn't as simple as capping the number of night games per team at three or four per season, because there are so many late broadcast windows over the course of the season. \nIt's more a matter of making the effort to eliminate the egregious situations, like Stanford's string of late kickoffs or Arizona's difficult back-to-back. \n\"It is what it is,'' Shaw said. \"But it would be great if we played a few more games when the sun is out.\" For more on college sports, see Jon Wilner's College Hotline at blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports .
