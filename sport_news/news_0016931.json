(AP) - The University of North Carolina’s flagship campus has come up with guidelines on proper communication among coaches, academic advisers and faculty about student athletes’ grades. \nThe News & Observer of Raleigh reported (http://bit.ly/1LRVpEp) the rules prohibit coaches from asking faculty members about an athlete’s grades and academic performance. They also prohibit faculty members from asking advisers about what grade an athlete would need to maintain eligibility. Advisers also are not allowed to offer that information. \nAthletic director Bubba Cunningham said Thursday the guidelines are not necessarily new but are designed to clarify responsibilities and expectations. \nThe school is being investigated by the NCAA about a long-running system of fraudulent African- and Afro-American Studies independent studies courses for 18 years that offered high grades in exchange for little or no work. \n___ \nInformation from: The News & Observer, http://www.newsobserver.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:15:18.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
