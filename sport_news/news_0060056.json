Jerry McBride/Durango Herald Bayfield senior Noah Loutherback has helped Bayfield to a 6-0 record and a Class 2A No. 2 ranking by CHSAA. B AYFIELD A lot could be said about the Bayfield Wolverines. It’s a team full of seniors – 13 to be exact – and a Class 2A No. 2 ranking by the Colorado High School Activities Association. It’s a team that has a potent offense that averages 37 points per game with an unblemished record at 6-0. However. with a high scoring offense, it’s also a team that fronts a defense that has allowed only 34 points the entire season and has three shutout victories, which includes a 42-0 romp last Friday at Montezuma-Cortez. And on the stout Bayfield defense stands one player in particular: a two-sided beast who is both humble and intimidating at the same time. Bayfield High School senior captain Noah Loutherback is a textbook left tackle and is a relentless animal at defensive end. Loutherback has helped lead a defense, and a team, that has a shot at winning a league title. “He’s a steady rock, you might say,” Bayfield head coach Gary Heide said. “He has mental stability and leadership and encouragement. He’s big and strong and very quick for a big guy. He’s got a great base and uses his size and thickness.” Loutherback’s determination and heart is something to marvel. He has a motor that hardly takes a breather, playing every down except for punts and kickoffs. He’s a tough guy, as well. Loutherback recently sustained a shoulder subluxation, which is a temporary shoulder dislocation that kept him out of last week’s win at Montezuma-Cortez. With chiropractic help and frequent visits to the trainer’s office, Loutherback has been cleared for play. The 6-foot-3, 230-pound brick said Bayfield has a lot on the line, especially with Alamosa approaching. “We are feeling fired up; we have a lot going for us,” said Loutherback, son of Brad and Jennifer Loutherback. “We want to keep the intensity up and keep it going so we don’t lose our fire when we head into the playoffs. This is a long season, and we want to make sure we keep it rolling.” Bayfield’s defense is coached by first-year defensive coordinator Mike Wnorowski and, according to Loutherback, his tutelage has been a difference maker. “I feel like he knows the way I play,” Loutherback said. “He knows how to cater to that. He knows how to cater to every strength we have and gives us the liberty to play ball.” Wnorowski’s style of coaching has given Bayfield’s 3-5-3 style of defense an identity, one that is a defensive wall preventing points on the board. Defense is the cruel side of football, and football can be a brutal sport, a collision sport, or a sport to learn from. Loutherback said football has taught him to work hard and earn everything. It has allowed him to enjoy his passion and give everything he has, and, as a senior, football has taught him leadership. “I think that’s the difference between this team and a lot of other teams I’ve played on,” Loutherback said. “Our senior class has stepped up and started to lead.” The senior leadership role has melted onto Loutherback’s off-field life, too. He’s always looking to encourage youngsters through sensibility while his grades, character and personality are some of the attributes that will be missed the most. Loutherback, 17, was born in Dallas and has been in Bayfield since 1998. After high school, he plans on enlisting in the Navy, and added he would love to play at the Academy but would need to put on about 50 more pounds. But before Loutherback can start thinking of seeing the world, Alamosa (3-4, 3-0 Intermountain League) will come knocking on Bayfield’s door, and Loutherback & Co. will have a chance to bring a league title home for the undefeated Wolverines. “I think we have the talent all the way around,” he said. He added that he hopes the Wolverines can take a shot at a state championship, too. Bayfield will host Alamosa for the league title and senior night at 7 p.m. onFriday at Wolverine Country Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:48:14.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
