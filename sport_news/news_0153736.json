The ball rolled through the end zone, and Seattle linebacker K.J. Wright deliberately tapped the ball over the back line, thinking the Seahawks would take possession on a touchback, which they did with 1:45 to go.\nBut it shouldn't have gone down that way.\n\"You can't bat the ball in any direction in the end zone. K.J. Wright batted the football, that is a foul for an illegal bat,\" NFL vice president of officiating Dean Blandino said on NFL Network following the game.\n\"The back judge was on the play. In his judgment, he didn't feel it was an overt act, so he didn't throw the flag. In looking at the replays, it did look like a bat. So the enforcement would be, basically we'd go back to the spot of the fumble, and Detroit would keep the football.\"\nBlandino also admitted, \"We have to make that call.\"\nThe Lions should have reclaimed the ball half the distance from the goal line, but that didn't happen. The play wasn't reviewable, either, since it came down to the back judge's assessment that Wright didn't intentionally bat the ball out of play.\nNFL VP of Officiating Dean Blandino comments on the Lions-Seahawks ending. http://t.co/BO90lIlUl8\n— NFL (@NFL) October 6, 2015 \"It's unfortunate, but you can't put the game in the referees' hands,\" Johnson said afterward.\nWright admitted that he believed he was making a cagey move, telling The Seattle Times : \"I thought I was making a smart play.\"\nIronically, it occurred in the very same end zone where the Seahawks benefited from the Fail Mary play three years ago on the same Monday Night Football stage that marked the final game overseen by replacement officials.\nOn this night, the regular zebras weren't much better.\n***\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\nA look at the bat from the lens of @GavinSmithPhoto\nWatch @DeanBlandino on the no-call: http://t.co/MblACOOXMe . pic.twitter.com/2MMUcSxgC1\n— Detroit Lions (@Lions) October 6, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DeanBlandino", "http://t.co/BO90lIlUl8", "https://twitter.com/GavinSmithPhoto", "http://t.co/2MMUcSxgC1", "http://t.co/MblACOOXMe", "https://twitter.com/NFL/status/651245803822977024", "https://twitter.com/Lions/status/651252739364790272", "http://twitter.com/bynatedavis"], "published": "2015-10-06T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:21:05.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
