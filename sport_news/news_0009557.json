Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 1:01 pm Cross-country Bobcats making progress By CHRIS DABOVICH chris.dabovich@bensonnews-sun.com San Pedro Valley News-Sun | 0 comments BENSON — Although the work and effort may not be translating into meet wins, it’s not indicative of the work, progress and work ethic on the part of the Benson girls’ and boys’ cross country teams. That’s how Benson Coach Randy Barney sees it as the Bobcats head into the Safford Invitational on Wednesday. The Bobcats enter that meet having just competed last in the Willcox Invitational. “We’ve had some good races individually,” said Barney. “Our team is young, but we are developing really well.” The girls team has fared well, anchored by team newcomer Lucrezia Gritti, a foreign exchange student from Italy, along senior Jessica Hamilton and Amanda Marks, also new to the team this year. “ Lucrezia is a wonderful addition,” said Barney. “One way these two [Marks] girls have have really helped is by being great running partners for our senior [Hamilton]. These girls push each other in practice and at meets, it is great to have these three girls to set an example for the rest of our team.” The Benson girls were led by Gritti’s fifth-place finish and who clocked in at 23 minutes, 50.18 seconds. Rounding out the Benson girls were Marks, 19th, 27:43; Megan Martell, 29th, 32:05. Thatcher and Safford finished tied with 29, but Thatcher’s sixth runner placed higher so the Eagles took the top spot. Morenci was third with 72. Rounding out the scoring were Ft. Thomas, 96; Willcox, 99; ASDB, Benson, Bisbee, Baboquivari and San Carlos did not have enough runners for team scoring. In the boys’ meet Bisbee took the top spot with 42, Safford second with 53 and Amphi third with 63. Rounding out the teams were Thatcher, 74; San Carlos, 101; Morenci, 144; Willcox, 166 and Benson, 177. ASDB, Baboquivari and Ft. Thomas did not score. Jay Haro was Benson’s top finisher 37th overall 22:08; Anthony Contreras, 42nd, 23:51.4; Raymond Markley, 45th, 24:47; Gavin Roman, 47th, 22:55 and Josh Settle, 48th, 27:13. The Bobcats entered that meet having run in Camp Verde Invitational.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:20:22.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
