Shelton picks up a block from teammate Delton Williams on a run against Indiana Saturday. (Photo: Rod Sanford | Lansing State Jour, Rod Sanford) \nThere are eight Power 5 unbeatens left in college football after Utah and Florida State took their first losses of the season Saturday, and Michigan State has moved up one spot in the Associated Press poll to No. 6. \nThe Spartans (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) actually fell a spot to No. 5 in the Amway Coaches Poll after Saturday's 52-26 home win over Indiana. Ohio State remained No. 1 in both polls, as has been the case all season. \nThe Spartans will get this week off and Mark Dantonio is going with no practices during the off week for the first time in his career, to help injured players get health and avoid further health issues. MSU returns to action Nov. 7 at Nebraska. \nMichigan stayed at No. 15 in the AP poll and No. 17 in the coaches' poll after a bye week. The Wolverines play Minnesota on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:58:14.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
