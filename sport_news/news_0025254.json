They are not inherently stupid. So, I have great faith in the common man in India and Pakistan,\" said Kasuri, who was foreign minister between 2002 and 2007.\n\"It is possible to do away with the misunderstandings between the two countries.\"\nHe added that it was up to the leadership — which could change the narrative for the better if it wanted — to seize the situation.\nHe was speaking on Monday before the launch of his book \"Neither A Hawk Nor A Dove\" in Mumbai. The same morning, senior journalist Sudheendra Kulkarni, who is chairman of the Observer Research Foundation and the event's organiser, had black paint thrown on him allegedly by Shiv Sainiks, who had threatened to disrupt the event.\nWhile stressing on open talks or backchannel negotiations to transform the situation between the two countries, Kasuri emphasised the need for \"a cultural exchange on a liberal visa regime\". He warned that if relationships between common people were destroyed, it would be catastrophic. \"We have murdered history… and paid a big price for it. It is not cost-free,\" Kasuri stressed.\n\"As a political worker, I recognise the right of people to protest… as long as it is peaceful, it is justified,\" said Kasuri, when asked about Sena's protest, adding that he had himself faced the brunt of police lathis, teargas and had been jailed for political activities.\nKasuri said he was saddened by the attack on Kulkarni and said there were elements on both sides of the border who did not want good relations between the two countries. He urged that the states must have their power, and if they abdicated their responsibility, it would be damaging.\n\"India has not been an election issue in Pakistan at least for the last three general elections... the ordinary people of Pakistan want good relations with India,\" said Kasuri, adding that surveys had shown that an overwhelming number of people of Pakistan wanted good relations with India.\nHe lauded the work done by the two countries on the peace process during the tenure of former premier Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which, he said, was carried forward diligently by his successor Manmohan Singh.\n\"It was the most productive peace process between the two countries since Independence,\" said Kasuri, noting that the perceptions of the people had changed quickly during the period. For instance, when India beat Pakistan in a cricket match at Lahore, Pakistanis had celebrated despite the matches between the two countries \"arousing a special type of fervour.\"\nKasuri said Vajpayee's national security advisor Brajesh Mishra had told him in Lahore that the Kashmir issue could be resolved in six months. Later, during the Congress-led UPA regime, India had spoken about settling the Kashmir issue \"out of the box\".\n\"If the relations between Bharat and Pakistan are good, then the position of Hindus in Pakistan and Muslims in Bharat will be better,\" said Kasuri. He also described the 26/11 terror attacks as \"badnasibi\" (bad luck), saying its perpetrators wanted to undo their good work.\nReplying to questions on the trial of 26/11 mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawah chief Hafiz Saeed, Kasuri said that \"courts in both countries, at least Pakistan, have become courts of public opinion,\" and noted how witnesses were scared to testify due to lack of witness protection laws.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:26:19.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
