The Romanian had arrived in Singapore under an injury cloud after picking up an ankle knock at the start of October, but the 24-year-old moved effortlessly around the court on Sunday and withstood Pennetta's attempts to get back into the contest. \nThe 33-year-old Italian played more like she had on her way to a stunning victory in New York last month in the second set but her resistance ended in a marathon eighth game when she dropped serve to trail 5-3 after staving off three break points. \nHIGH INTENSITY \nPennetta, who announced she would retire from tennis at the end of the season, forced only two break points, both in the opening game of the second set, during the entire match and her unforced error count of 27 made life much easier for Halep. \nSidelined by leg and arm injuries, Sharapova had yet to complete a match since Wimbledon but after shaking off some initial rust, the Russian was back to her very best against Radwanska, playing each point as if her life depended on it. \nA single break was enough to give the Pole an edge in the opener but her excellent retrieving skills could do little to prevent the world number three from rallying for victory once the Russian had raised her intensity levels through the roof. \n\"Coming into this event, I tried to do everything I could to be healthy and although I didn't play my best tennis today, sometimes that's not what matters,\" Sharapova said of a match that lasted two hours, 48 minutes with a large portion of games going to deuce. \n\"I'm so happy that I got through and have a chance to play two more matches to end the season and hopefully more, so I couldn't be happier at this point.\" \nThe 'White Group' consists of Garbine Muguruza, Petra Kvitova, Angelique Kerber and Lucie Safarova, with play in that pool starting on Monday.
