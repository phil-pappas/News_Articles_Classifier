Trailing 7-0 early in the third quarter, the Yellow Jackets (4-2, 2-1) drove the ball to the Raiders’ 20-yard line on their second possession of the second half. However, an errant pass on third down by Sprayberry quarterback Andrew Pereira was intercepted by Jelani Reid of Riverwood (5-1, 3-0).The Raiders proceeded to score a touchdown on their next possession with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Porter Sanford to Brandon Moore.Trailing 14-0 late in the third quarter, the Yellow Jackets started their next drive on their 34-yard line and got the ball down to the Raiders 1 in nine plays. However, on third-and-goal, a low snap was fumbled and Riverwood’s John Beckley recovered.A 23-yard field goal by Daniel Rocha sealed the win.“We didn’t do what got us to this point of the season,” Sprayberry coach Billy Shackelford said. “We didn’t play well consistently on offense to win. Our defense gave us chances and we limited big plays on special teams. You can’t turn the ball over in the red zone twice against anybody let alone a good team like Riverwood.”The Yellow Jackets’ offense struggled throughout the night, amassing only 107 yards of total offense. Running back Trey Sermon was limited to minus-18 yards rushing. D.J. Worthy came off the bench for Sprayberry and had a team-high 29 yards rushing while Pereira completed six passes for 83 yards.The lone touchdown for the Yellow Jackets was a 1-yard quarterback sneak by Pereira with 2:41 left in the game.“I’m disappointed because we didn’t play Sprayberry football and put our best foot forward,” Shackelford said.Riverwood scored the lone points of the first half when Sanford connected with Evan Crossing for a 13-yard touchdown pass early in the second quarter. Sanford finished the evening with a game-high 92 yards passing and two touchdowns. Crossing’s 59 receiving yards on six catches were both game-highs.One highlight for the Yellow Jackets’ special teams unit was a 72-yard punt by Jake Pickett in the first quarter. “One loss doesn’t define the season,” Shackelford said. “The next game is the most important one and we’ll regroup.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:52:10.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
