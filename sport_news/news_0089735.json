With the point, the Mexican side topped the group – finishing three points clear of Herediano and five ahead of Isidro Metapan.\nElsewhere, the already-qualified LA Galaxy completed their group stage slate with a 1-1 draw at Comunicaciones.\nAlan Gordon appeared to give the MLS side victory — and the knockout round's top seed — with his scrappy 84th-minute goal. But the Galaxy conceded in additional time when Rolando Blackburn struck at the back post, dropping Bruce Arena's team to the fifth seed.\nThe Galaxy finished on eight points, four clear of Central and Comunicaciones.\nHere are the quarterfinal matchups:\nNo. 1 Club America vs. No. 8 Seattle Sounders No. 2 D.C. United vs. No. 7 Queretaro No. 3 Real Salt Lake vs. No. 6 Tigres No. 4 Santos Laguna vs. No. 5 LA Galaxy\nThe two-leg quarterfinals are scheduled for Feb. 23-25 and March 1-3, while the semifinals are set for March 15-17 and April 5-7. The final is expected to be held in late April.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:41:54.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
