Comment Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 11:40 PM By Observer-Dispatch Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 11:40 PM Utica College's Thomas Woodburn kicked a school record five field goals, including a game-tying field goal in the fourth quarter and the game winner in overtime, to lead the Pioneers to a 22-19 win over Brockport State in an Empire 8 Conference football game Saturday evening in Brockport. Woodburn, a senior from West Islip, won the game for the Pioneers with a 35-yard field goal to give UC its second-straight OT victory. UC (3-1, 4-2) defeated Ithaca 30-27 in overtime on Oct. 3. Cortland State beat the Pioneers 47-40 in OT on Sept. 26. Woodburn tied the game with a 34 yarder with one second remaining in the fourth quarter. Brockport's Dan Andrews gave the Golden Eagles a 19-16 lead with 8:51 left, but they were unable to connect on the conversion pass. Brockport (1-2, 3-2) got the ball back at the UC 43-yard line with 5:30 left after a Teddy VanGalen interception. The Golden Eagles moved to the UC 11 in seven plays but were stopped when Pioneers linebacker Derrick Sekuterski picked off a Wayne Bonsell pass in the end zone to set up the 63-yard game-tying drive capped by Woodburn's 34-yard field goal. UC stopped Brockport on the Golden Eagles' first possession of overtime and won it on Woodburn's fifth field goal. Ryan Burnett, who scored Utica's only touchdown on a 1-yard run in the third quarter, ran twice for seven yards in OT to get Woodburn in position for the game winner. UC plays at St. John Fisher on Saturday.
