New York will enter Tuesday's winner-take-all game against the Astros with little positive momentum after being swept in three games by Baltimore and losing six of their final seven regular-season games. The Yankees fell behind 7-1 in the fifth inning and stranded 11 runners. New York was 4 for 31 with runners in scoring position in closing the series, including 1 for 12 Sunday. Rangers 9, Angels 2 ARLINGTON, Texas — Cole Hamels and the Texas Rangers finally clinched the AL West title on the last day of the regular season. Hamels pitched a three-hitter, Adrian Beltre hit a go-ahead homer and the Rangers eliminated Los Angeles from playoff contention. A year after their 95 losses were the most in the American League, two months after they were still eight games out of first place and three days after ensuring themselves a postseason spot, the Rangers wrapped up their sixth division title. Texas plays its first AL division series game since 2011 on Thursday at Toronto. Moments after the final out, AL West championship banners already were flying at the ballpark. The Rangers will go there under first-year manager Jeff Banister, whose team lost ace Yu Darvish to Tommy John surgery before the season started. D-Backs 5, Astros 3 PHOENIX — Houston is going to the playoffs for the first time in a decade despite ending the regular season with a loss. The Astros led the AL wild-card race by a game heading into Sunday. They shared a few high fives in the dugout in the eighth inning after clinching it when the Angels lost to Texas. Houston finished 86-76 to reach the postseason for the first time since playing the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 World Series. The Astros will play their first AL playoff game Tuesday night, against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Not bad for a team that had three 100-loss seasons before going 70-92 in 2014. Pirates 4, Reds 0 PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh clinched home field in the NL wild card game, winning behind J.A. Happ's stellar outing and Pedro Alvarez's long homer. The Pirates (98-64) locked up the right to host the Chicago Cubs (97-65) Wednesday night in a winner-take-all playoff with a victory on the final day of the regular season. Despite having the second-best record in the major leagues, the Pirates finished second to the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Central. Pittsburgh will host the wild card game for the third straight year after beating Cincinnati in 2013 and losing to the San Francisco Giants last season. Page 2 of 2 - The Pirates had 20 straight losing seasons, the longest streak in major North American professional sports history, before their current run of postseason appearances. Mets 1, Nationals 0 NEW YORK — Jacob deGrom looked especially sharp in his abbreviated playoff tuneup, and the NL East champion Mets finally scored on Curtis Granderson's eighth-inning homer. One day after Washington ace Max Scherzer pitched a no-hitter against New York to finish a doubleheader sweep, the Mets (90-72) made a run at a combined no-hitter of their own. They reached 90 wins for the first time in nine years and snapped a five-game losing streak that cost them home-field advantage in the upcoming Division Series against the Dodgers. Next up, deGrom starts Game 1 in the best-of-five matchup Friday at Los Angeles. Indians 3, Red Sox 1 CLEVELAND — Danny Salazar finished his first season as a full-time starter on a positive note, sending the Indians to a win. Salazar (14-10) gave up one run 5 1-3 innings to win for just the second time in six starts. The right-hander began the season at Triple-A Columbus, a demotion that served as a wake-up call for the 25-year-old, who bounced back and tied Carlos Carrasco for the team lead in wins. Bryan Shaw worked out of a jam in the eighth, and Cody Allen got three outs for his 34th save. Boston starter Rick Porcello (9-15) came up short in his bid to hit double-digit wins for the seventh straight season. He allowed 10 hits in seven innings.
