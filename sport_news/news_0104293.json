CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCOSHOCTON — Last week was a dream week for Coshocton County, as each team came away with a win. \nRiver View earned its first win of the season and first in two years, Coshocton held off an undefeated Meadowbrook team and Ridgewood dominated an overmatched Strasburg team. \nBut as always, the celebration ends with a new week. Here's a look ahead to what could be another 3-0 sweep for county teams in Week 8. \nCoshocton vs Dover \nWhen and where: 7 p.m. Friday at Coshocton \nRecords: Coshocton (5-2, 3-0); Dover (3-4, 1-1) \nLast Week: Coshocton defeated Meadowbrook 39-34; Dover defeated Cambridge 37-23. \nThe Redskins' offense got off to a quick start, and a fumble recovery by Kobie Means gave the team a 30-14 lead, but the undefeated Colts came storming back in the fourth quarter. \nCoshocton's offense stole the show for most of the night, but it was the defense that had two late stops to seal the win. \nThat win gave the Redskins their fifth straight after a slow 0-2 start and puts them firmly in the Region 17 playoff picture. \nNow they will prepare to host a Dover team that has struggled this year, looking for revenge from last year's loss, while honoring the seniors that have led the program this year. \nCoach's comments: \"This week is very important for league purposes. We want to send our seniors off with a win on their home field this last game, and Dover is a measuring stick,\" coach Jim Woodrum said. \"People will say, 'Oh they aren't as good as they have been in the past,' but they aren't bad. They are a real good football team.\" \n\"We've got to be fundamentally sound on Friday. They are very well coached. You know week in and week out they are going to get better every week, and I think our kids are ready to play. They are excited,\" Woodrum said. \nSenior Night thoughts: \"They are a great group of kids. I don't think we've ever had a better group of kids than this group of kids as far as being team players, sacrificing individual success for team success,\" Woodrum said. \"You want those kids that are willing to put their individual success aside. They have just been a joy to coach.\" \nRiver View vs Bishop Rosecrans \nWhen and Where: 7 p.m. Friday at Bishop Rosecrans \nRecords: River View (1-6, 1-1); Rosecrans (1-6, 0-3) \nLast Week: River View defeated Claymont 13-12; Rosecrans was defeated by Marietta 63-28. \nThe Black Bears earned their first win of the season in a close battle with Claymont; a Trace Lingo 58-yard touchdown catch from Keith Stewart gave them the lead in the fourth quarter. Then the defense held strong and stopped Mustangs. \nBryar Cox also ran for a 64-yard touchdown in the third quarter, giving the team a 7-6 lead. \nIt was a win that was a long time coming for a Black Bears team that finished last year winless. The improvement they have shown each week was evident, but it never translated into a win until last week. \nThe celebration ended Saturday morning, when the team was watching film from the win. The focus is on Rosecrans, another game that is winnable for them. \nCoach's comments: \"These guys practice well every week. That hasn’t changed, and our intensity in practice wasn’t much different this week,\" coach Bob Forgave said. \"I think there is more of a positive vibe around the school, but we practice hard every week.\" \n\"You can enjoy it until your first practice, and then you have to be gone. We always watch film Saturday mornings, so the focus has been on Rosecrans. It’s definitely a game we can win. For what they have, they aren’t a bad football team. I still think it’s more about how we play and how we execute,\" he said. \nRidgewood vs Tuscarawas Central Catholic \nWhen and Where: 1:30 p.m. Saturday at TCC \nRecords: Ridgewood (6-1, 4-0); TCC (3-4, 1-3) \nLast Week: Ridgewood defeated Strasburg 42-6, TCC was defeated by Sandy Valley 28-14. \nThe Generals started the game with a pass from running back Trent Harrison to Braeden Smith for a 54-yard touchdown strike. After that, the game turned into a physical running game. \nRidgewood never really struggled in its Week 7 matchup as it — like Coshocton — has now won five in a row and is in a good spot for the Region 17 playoff picture. The team also still hasa game lead on Sandy Valley for the Inter-Valley Conference title. \nThis week should equal another win for a Generals team that has gotten going offensively, but TCC's spread offense will challenge an improved Ridgewood secondary. \nCoach's comments: \"We have to limit their big plays — they throw it about 30 or 40 times a game. They are one of those teams that calls a lot of different plays, they go for it on fourth down, they onside kick. It's a different world when you go up there,\" coach John Slusser said. \"We have to be prepared for everything.\" \n\"Our kids know what they have to do and we have been in a pretty good state of mind. We want to continue to improve offensively, I think that's been the biggest surprise is how effective we've been. I still don't think we are a great offense, but we've been effective,\" Slusser said. \"It helps us that TCC almost beat Sandy Valley this week, and our kids know how good Sandy Valley is.\" \ncteaguerob@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:45:50.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
