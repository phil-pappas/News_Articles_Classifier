We just went in and watched our tape and left this morning. But he's a good, strong, fast back. Probably the best in the country, but you know what, if you can get everybody up there, you can tackle him. There's nobody that can't be tackled. We've just gotta do it consistently. He's gonna get his yards, but hopefully not an abundance of yards. But every team that plays LSU, they know they've gotta try to stop him. I guess Alabama did a pretty good job of stopping Nick Chubb (Saturday), although he did have that one run late in the game, so you know, everybody can be stopped if you play really, really good defense.\"\nOn current point in the season...\n\"We're 2-3. We're not the only team in America that's 2-3. There's a lot of 'em out there. LSU's coming to town. Very, very, very physical team. They will really present a challenge for us, but hopefully we can give our players a plan to be successful and work our tails off to get ready this week and give a good fight out there.\"\nDid weather cut Sunday preparation short...\n\"Definitely. We were advised to leave the stadium and try to get home. A lot of areas were being closed down and so forth. I think one or two of the defensive coaches were there when I left, but they were advised to go ahead and get out.\"\nWill weather affect preparation this week...\n\"I don't think so. Preparation-wise, we've gotta block and tackle. All those things are more important than maybe some gimmick plays right now. The execution of our plays is not very good, but we need to do more also. We need to do more. I need to try to help our offense more. There's no question about that. So I'll hopefully try to add something. We need a spark somehow. When we've got guys open, the ball's gotta be thrown at 'em. We sort of got away from that (Saturday).\"\nInjury updates...\n\"Injury-wise, our trainer says Lorenzo Nunez should be OK. They think Brandon Wilds could be back this week. We'll see. Other than that, we came out OK injury-wise.\"\nWhether Spurrier will take over more play-calling duties...\n\"Let me tell you something about play-calling. Everybody knows when you call on a run on first down and it doesn't go anywhere, you shoulda thrown the ball, and when you pass on first down, 'Man, we've gotta run the ball. We're passing too much.' A play-caller usually is about as good as the way the players execute the play. I called some plays (Saturday). I've called a bunch of plays the last two weeks. And the ones I fired in there didn't do very well. I'll say that. But we'll see whatever's best. We'll see whatever's best. But it's the execution of the plays is our biggest problem.\"\nOn potential lineup changes...\n\"We'll wait and see. I don't like to do it through the newspaper, but there'll be some different players. We've gotta have a few different players out there and see if we can get a little more spark on offense. But if Lorenzo's healthy, he's still gonna be our starter, and we anticipate him being healthy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:32:13.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
