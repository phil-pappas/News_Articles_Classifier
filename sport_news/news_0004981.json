Instead, Marshall dropped a pass in the end zone in the fourth quarter and was called for a false start with one second remaining, which resulted in a 10-second runoff that ended the game.\nAfter, Marshall accepted the blame for his mistakes during the Jets ' 30-23 loss. First, he told reporters that his dropped touchdown was completely his fault.\n\"Absolutely, that's all on me,\" Marshall said via ESPN. \"If I make that play, it puts us in a better position. I didn't make the play and it put our team in a bad situation. You have to make those plays in games like this, so it's all on me. It will definitely be my fuel this week to get better.\"\nThen, Marshall tweeted that he deserved to walk back to New York after his performance.\nMy A** should be walking back to New York. How you bounce back after moments like this produce CHAMPIONS or CHUMPS.. . #jets \nâ€” Machine Marshall (@BMarshall) October 25, 2015 It wasn't all bad for Marshall, as he still ended up catching four passes for 67 yards and he recovered an onside kick, but the dropped touchdown was a catch he usually makes. And if he had made that catch, the Jets wouldn't have been forced to settle for a field goal. Furthermore, if Marshall had gotten himself set on the game's final play, the Jets would've had a chance to hoist up a jump ball in the end zone.\nInstead, the Patriots walked away with their 20th consecutive home victory in the month of October.\n\nBrandon Marshall wasn't happy with his performance against the Patriots.
