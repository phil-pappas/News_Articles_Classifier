He can do it. He has already proven that. DeGrom beat Clayton Kershaw in Game 1 of the NL Division Series and struck out 13. Thursday night the stage is even bigger because it's a winner-takes-all Game 5 and he's going up against Zack Greinke , the other ace of the Dodgers' staff. The Dodgers are slight favorites at home. My gut tells me the Mets come up short, because they needed to close it out at Citi Field on Tuesday but couldn't beat a dominant Kershaw. I really hope I am wrong. I am rooting for the Mets. There would be nothing better than a Mets vs. Cubs matchup in the NLCS.
