We’re good enough, and that’s the frustrating thing.” \nThe Golden Eagles (3-3, 1-1 in Conference USA) moved the ball against Marshall, gaining a total 439 yards on offense, while the defense was relatively stingy, limiting the Thundering Herd to just 277 yards. \nBut turnovers as well as ill-timed and senseless penalties kept Southern Miss from having more success last week. Monken’s squad lost four fumbles (two by quarterback Nick Mullens, one by receiver Casey Martin and one by running back Jalen Richard) and Mullens was intercepted once. In addition, receiver Mike Thomas was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct following a post-touchdown celebration the officials deemed excessive. And lineman Darian Yancey jumped offsides before a Marshall field goal attempt, giving the home team another shot at a touchdown — which it took advantage of. \n“Those are frustrating as well,” Monken said. “Those are things that eliminate momentum. And it’s something we hadn’t really done. We had actually done pretty well on special teams the last few weeks, minus the field goal stuff. So we’ve got to get that cleaned up.” \nOffensive coordinator Chip Lindsey said there are no excuses for committing five turnovers in a game, especially after having amassed just five giveaways in the previous five contests. \n“It’s too many,” he said. “We’ve got to do a better job. It’s something we’ve emphasized a lot, so it’s disappointing it showed up in a big game like that. For us to win these big games, we’ve got to make sure we take care of the ball.” \nMonken added he’s confident the Golden Eagles’ performance at Marshall is but a blip on the radar screen. \n“We can control our future,” he said. “That’s what you always want. I don’t care where you’re coaching. You want an opportunity in anything you do in life, and we have that opportunity. We’re good enough.” \nSouthern Miss hosts Texas-San Antonio at 6 p.m. Oct. 17 in the team’s homecoming game. 30 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1Lrabq4 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:05:06.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
