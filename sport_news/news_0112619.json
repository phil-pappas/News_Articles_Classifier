Patrick Rodgers, Patton Kizzire, Chad Campbell, Ryan Palmer, Ricky Barnes, D.H. Lee, Ryo Ishikawa, Greg Owen, Shane Bertsch and Brendon Todd shot 65, and Henrik Norlander also was 6 under with two holes left. Lee birdied six of his first seven holes, then bogeyed the next two.

Jimmy Walker opened with a 66, and U.S. Presidents Cup teammate Rickie Fowler had a 72. Thompson and Hubbard eagled the par-5 16th, with Hubbard holing 30-foot putt and Thompson a 25-footer in their morning rounds. \nLPGA TAIWAN CHAMPIONSHIP \nTAIPEI, TAIWAN \nJi Eun-hee shot a 6-under 66 in windy conditions to take a one-stroke lead in the LPGA Taiwan Championship.
