''It was so challenging on Thursday and Friday. \n''I felt I was surviving but played some really steady, good golf and that was a real difference - I got off to a start where most people got beat up. \n''I was able to play it two-over par for the first 36 and had a really steady, nice solid weekend.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:18:36.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
