Golden State Warriors center Andrew Bogut shed 22 pounds this offseason thanks to a new diet inspired by a documentary about sugar.\nAdChoices The 30-year-old checked into camp with his weight down from 275 to the low 250s, according to CSN Bay Area’s Monte Poole . He cut out processed sugars, the catalyst being a documentary he saw on Australian TV titled Is Sugar the New Fat?\n“I watched that documentary,” Bogut said. “It’s unbelievable, man. (Sugar) is in absolutely everything. I have a couple friends that are label readers. I used to give them so much (crap), telling them, ‘Man, just eat it. Stop reading the label.’ And now I’m one of those guys.”\nNow that he has a little less weight on him, perhaps Bogut won’t be accused of intentionally tossing the NBA’s best player around .\nAs a big man at age 30, Bogut can’t be sure how many years he has left, so it’s in his best interest to keep his body in as good a shape as possible. Coaches and teammates say they’ve noticed a difference, and as Poole notes, a fitter Bogut may be able to better adapt when the Warriors go with a smaller lineup, thus making the reigning champions even more dangerous.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.csnbayarea.com/warriors/new-look-bogut-turning-heads-warriors-training-camp", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lebron-james-hits-head-on-camera-suffers-cut-video/264129"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:01:48.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
