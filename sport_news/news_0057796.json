Now we need just two good races to finish this successful season off.” \nRossi is comfortable on Malaysia’s muggy, slippery Sepang circuit, winning six times in the top-tier class. \nThere is a chance he could clinch the title on Sunday if he tops the podium and Lorenzo falters to finish lower down in the pack. \nBut that looks unlikely, with Lorenzo a fixture on the podium all season, and the championship could go down to the wire next month at Valencia. \nLorenzo, 28, who won the world championship in 2010 and 2012, is yet to win in the premier race at Sepang. \nHe may need victories in the final two contests for a shot at his third MotoGP world title. \n“The main goal is to cut some more points from Valentino’s margin and I will try to arrive to Valencia with a smaller disadvantage. I feel strong and look forward to racing in Malaysia,” said the Spaniard. \nRossi’s lead would have been even slimmer had Lorenzo been able to close out a victory at Phillip Island. \nBut defending champion Marc Marquez swept beneath Lorenzo on the final go-around to win a thrilling race that saw 52 overtakes between the top four finishers. \nRossi has 296 points, followed by Lorenzo’s 285. \nDespite his stirring victory in Australia, Marquez is well back in third on 222 points. \nHis chances of repeating as champion were dashed by a broken left hand suffered last month while training on his mountain bike at home in Spain. \nRossi was the runner-up at Sepang last year in a race that was meaningless for the world title, as Marquez had already secured it with a dominant season.
