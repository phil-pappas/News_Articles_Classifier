HELENA CENTRAL 16 \nHELENA-WEST HELENA — Lonoke scored 26 consecutive points after falling behind 8-0 early and the Jackrabbits spoiled homecoming for the Cougars of Helena-West Helena Central in a 2-4A game Friday night. \nHelena-West Helena Central (3-4, 2-2) started fast, putting together a 4-play, 65-yard scoring drive that took up 1:16, ending on a 1-yard run by K.K. Harvey. The Cougars faked the extra-point attempt and holder Jordan Watson slipped a shovel pass to Aswad Allen to put Helena-West Helena up 8-0. \nThe Cougars then embarked on an 18-play drive from their 25 to the Lonoke 15, where the drive stalled and Helena-West Helena turned the ball over on downs. Then, Lonoke (3-4, 1-3) got going. \nThe Jackrabbits had a third-and-12 situation from their 13 when quarterback Savant Rountree hit Justin Meadows for an 87-yard score with 10:47 remaining in the second quarter. The try for two failed and Helena-West Helena led 8-6. \nLonoke stopped the Cougars, and Xavier Hodge put the Jackrabbits in front to stay with 5:36 to go in the first half with a 3-yard scoring run. Meadows ran in the two-point conversion to put Lonoke up 14-8, which was the halftime score. \nLonoke’s Kameron Cole intercepted an errant Cougars pass with 3:44 to go in the third quarter. Hodge scored six plays later to cap off a 47-yard drive with 10:31 to go in the game. The try for two failed and it was 20-8. \nHodge scooped up a Cougars fumble with 5:24 to play and returned it 62 yards for the score to push the lead to 26-8 after the failed two-point conversion. \nHelena-West Helena’s Malik Arnett scored on a 13-yard run with 2:08 left to cap off a 6-play, 62-yard drive. Arnett threw to Kameron Davis for the two-point conversion to make the score 26-16. \nCENTRAL ARK.
