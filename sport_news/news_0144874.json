It's going to be one long winter for Yadier Molina and the team that led the majors with 100 wins.\nStephen Piscotty hit a two-run homer for the second straight day, but John Lackey lasted just three innings and St. Louis was eliminated with a 6-4 loss to the Chicago Cubs in Game 4 of the NL Division Series on Tuesday.\nKevin Siegrist served up two more home runs, including a massive drive to right for rookie Kyle Schwarber in the seventh — the Cubs' 10th homer in three games.\nMolina could only watch as the Cardinals were knocked out in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in their active run of five consecutive postseason appearances. The All-Star catcher was scratched with weakness in his left thumb after he gamely tried to play with a strained ligament that sidelined him for the last part of the regular season.\nManager Mike Matheny said Molina could catch, but swinging a bat was a problem. He went 1 for 8 with two strikeouts in the first three games of the series.\nSt. Louis overcame several injuries to key performers while storming to its third consecutive NL Central title. But it missed electric right-hander Carlos Martinez against the slugging Cubs, and veterans Matt Adams and Jon Jay were left off the postseason roster after returning late in the year from injuries.\nAlso without a banged-up Molina, the Cardinals failed to return to the NL Championship Series after losing there to the Giants in 2014.\nMatheny decided to go with Lackey on short rest with St. Louis facing elimination, and it looked like a smart decision when the right-hander struck out his final two batters in a perfect first.\nBut the second inning quickly got away from Lackey, who was visibly angry after yielding a two-out RBI single to pitcher Jason Hammel. Javier Baez followed with a three-run homer to right, giving the Cubs a 4-2 lead and sending a charge through the frenzied crowd of 42,411 at Wrigley Field.\nThe collapse in the second wasted a fast start for St. Louis, which grabbed a 2-0 lead when Piscotty connected on Hammel's fourth pitch of the game. Piscotty, who made his major league debut on July 21, also hit a two-run homer in the Cardinals' 8-6 loss on Monday night.\n___\nJay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
