The world now consumes 93.6 million barrels of oil every day.\nRegions like the Arctic \"are one of the areas that, if we're going to be able to do this, we need to examine,\" he said.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey estimates that American Arctic waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas contain 26 billion barrels or more of recoverable oil.\nThe Arctic's vast oil and gas potential is exactly what worries scientists, who warn against tapping new sources of fossil fuels at a time when the world needs to drastically reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption in order to prevent catastrophic changes to the earth's climate.\nEnvironmental groups, which had staged media campaigns aimed at tarnishing Shell's reputation and tried unsuccessfully to block Arctic-bound vessels, reveled in Shell's disappointment.\n\"Big oil has sustained an unmitigated defeat,\" Greenpeace UK Executive Director John Sauven said.\nShell, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands, warned investors that the disappointing well results would lead to a charge against its earnings for the third quarter. It did not disclose the size of the charge but said the accounting value of the project is $3 billion, with another $1.1 billion in commitments to contractors. The company took charges of $2.1 billion in 2013 and $1.9 billion in 2014 also as a result of disappointing drilling results in the U.S.\nShell's shares were down 3 percent Monday in afternoon trading, in line with a broad market decline, to $45.89. Shell's share price has fallen by around a third over the past year as oil prices have fallen by half, to about $45 a barrel.\nThose weak oil prices are forcing oil companies around the world to cancel or delay new exploration, especially in risky or high-cost areas. That was probably a factor in Shell's decision to abandon offshore Alaska.\nThe Alaskan decision is \"an example of not going forward with a project because there is just not enough oil and gas to make it economic,\" said Louise Cooper, an independent analyst at CooperCity. \"If the oil price rises again and the well becomes economic, then it can try again.\"\nBut Miyoko Sakashita, oceans program director for the Center for Biological Diversity, urged Shell not to make another attempt.\n\"Polar bears, Alaska's Arctic and our climate just caught a huge break,\" Sakashita said. \"Here's hoping Shell leaves the Arctic forever.\"\n___\nAssociated Press Writer Pan Pylas in London contributed to this report.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:45:43.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
