Norris said he kept pitching last season after finding out he had a cancerous growth on his thyroid. In a message on Twitter and Instagram on Monday, Oct. 19, the 22-year-old Norris said he found out the growth was malignant but was told by a doctor that he could wait until the end of the season to have it removed.
