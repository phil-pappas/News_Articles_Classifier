The 2-0 San Jose Sharks looking this sharp. They have scored seven goals and given up one. They have surrendered 23.5 shots per game. Coach Peter DeBoer is having a major influence. So much for the idea that time is needed for players to adjust to a new coach.\n2. Arizona Coyotes are 2-0 and creating offense like they are the Tampa Bay Lightning. They were still supposed to have trouble scoring again this season. They have six goals, with five different players finding the back of the net.\n3. Oscar Lindberg of the New York Rangers leading all NHL rookies with four goals in three games. He wasn’t a lock to make the team.\n4. The Pittsburgh Penguins struggling to score in their first two games. Phil Kessel has nine shots on goal. Sidney Crosby has one shot attempt, and it was blocked, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review .\n5. Rookie Dylan Larkin, 19, playing like he is one of Detroit’s top players. Everyone understood his potential, but he is exceeding expectations. He’s plus-6 in two games.\n6. The Columbus Blue Jackets looking disorganized. They have given up nine goals in two games when we expected them to roar out of the gate.\n7. Low-scoring Florida Panthers scored seven times in their season-opening win against the Philadelphia Flyers. If this team can generate more goals, it will be a factor in the Atlantic.\n8. Winnipeg Jets are 2-0, reminding competitors in the Central Division to factor them into what promises to be an incredible division race.\n9. The coach’s challenge having a strong impact. The first two challenges changed the call on goals. But shouldn’t we have given coaches an extra timeout? Coaches don’t like to risk their timeout early in the game.\n10. The Auston Matthews sweepstakes starting so early. Already there is chatter around the NHL because the Arizona native is soaring in the Swiss Elite League. The leading prospect for the 2016 draft has six goals in his first eight games, and some scouts say he was ready to play in the NHL this season.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://triblive.com/sports/penguins/9240617-74/penguins-coyotes-goal#axzz3oH8EcPDr"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:24:20.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
