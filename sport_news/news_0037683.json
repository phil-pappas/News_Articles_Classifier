I know it will absolutely shock all of you who know me to discover that I hold the exact opposite opinion. But let me tell you why! \nAs these lists frequently do, let's start the countdown from the bottom and work our way up to #1. 15) He ain't a member of the Tebow family \nLook, I get it. Mark Richt's relatively outspoken faith and actions directed to call attention to that faith make people uncomfortable sometimes. That's ok, and I'm not saying you're a hateful or bad person for being uncomfortable that someone else is comfortable talking about their faith. Really. That's ok to feel that way. \nWhat I do think, however, is that this colors those folks' opinions on what Richt's long term life strategy is. They tend to assume that because he has a strong personal faith that he's outspoken about, he's just going to up and quit one of these years and move somewhere and be a missionary. (Like Tim Tebow's family, who were/are missionaries in the Philippines, which is where the reference above comes from.) But, see, the thing is, Richt was asked about exactly that issue at last year's SEC Media Days, and this was his response: \nPeople come to me and say: \"Coach whenever you retire we think you're gonna go off and do mission work and stuff like that.\" But there's not a greater mission than college athletics and being the head coach at the University of Georgia. There's so many young men we get to touch their lives and influence. It's a mission in itself, really. (My wife) Kathryn and I were talking about it the other day. \nSee, that's the thing most people miss when they assume he's gonna go Jesus-y and scamper off to do missionary work. This is what he considers his mission work. (That is to say, coaching football.) This is his \"position to which he's been called.\" He's not just going to drop it and head off to Honduras. If he gets to do it the way he wants to do it, it's far more likely that he'll be around as long as Tom Osborne, Bobby Bowden, and Vince Dooley were. If you don't like his work and want him to leave UGA, he's not going to do it for you. You're going to have to push him out the door. 14) Now is not the time to have this discussion \nAgain, I get it. Going into this season, it seemed like half the Bulldog fanbase expected us to blow everybody out and win the national championship, and when we lose two games in a row, you get mad as hell, and you're not gonna take it anymore. And in your anger and frustration, many people just lash out and say, \"We always lose like this EVERY DANG YEAR. We need to make a change!\" \nBut here's the thing: The time to discuss a head coach's job is not right after a devastating loss... or even two devastating losses back-to-back. There's a reason that, unless extenuating circumstances dictate otherwise, every Athletic Director waits until the end of the season to assess a coach's performance. I can assure you that nobody likes getting their doors blown off by Alabama and then beaten by Tennessee less than Greg McGarity and Mark Richt. But let's see how the season finishes out. If we lose out and end up 4-8, then we'll have a much different discussion than if we win out, finish 10-2, and make it to the SEC Championship Game. (And the result of that SEC Championship Game would have a significant bearing on the discussion, as well.) \nThe point is, everybody's emotional and on-edge right now, and that's the absolute worst time to be making a major decision like whether to fire your head coach. 13) Mark Richt has sustained the most success for the longest period of time in Georgia history \nMark Richt has a higher winning percentage over his first 190 games (73.68%) than any coach in Georgia history. After 190 games, Vince Dooley stood at 67.37% near the end of the 1980 season, and Wally Butts stood at 61.05% during the 1956 season. \n\"But Vineyarddawg, those coaches were coaching at a completely different time in college football,\" you say. \"Today, we expect more from the University of Georgia. We expect to consistently be elite, not always losing games to friggin' teams we ought to beat every year.\" Well, let's just look at that. During his first 15 years in Athens, Vince Dooley finished in the bottom half of the SEC 3 times. He also finished right at the 50% line (that's 5th or worse in the 10-team league) an additional 5 times in his first 15 years. By contrast, Mark Richt has finished in the bottom 50% of the SEC... exactly zero times in his first 15 years. He has finished right at the 50% line (3rd in a 6-team SEC East) a total of 4 times. That means that out of his first 14 years (because the 15th isn't complete yet), he has finished in the top half of the SEC 11 times. Literally no coach in Georgia history has done that. (Wally Butts did it 10 times in his first 14 years, and in a significantly weaker 12-team SEC than the one we currently have.) 12) Mark Richt is still one of the most successful coaches in the entire country \nAlright, y'all are going to give me some flak on this one, I'll bet. But to fairly compare Mark Richt to his peers, we have to compare him against peers of similar competition. That means that you have to compare him against coaches that have been coaching at Power 5 schools. It's wonderful that Chris Petersen has a career winning percentage of 83.6% in his 10 years at the Division I level, but 8 of those 10 years were at Boise State, when he had a maximum of 1 or 2 games a year against Power 5 competition. \nSo who are Mark Richt's peers? Well, let's take a look at the winningest active coaches in college football who have coached at least 36 games (3 seasons) at a Power 5 school. Why a 3 season minimum? Well, it's enough to establish a Power 5 track record, but even more simply, that's as far as anybody seems to look back anymore, if even that far. Anyway, here are the numbers, with their total number of seasons coaching at the Power 5 level in parentheses (and as a reminder, Mark Richt is at 73.68%):- Urban Meyer (6 at Florida & in 4th at Ohio State): 85.83% - Jimbo Fisher (in 6th at FSU): 85.14% - Mark Helfrich (in 3rd at Oregon): 79.41% - Bob Stoops (in 17th at Oklahoma): 79.26% - David Shaw (in 5th at Stanford): 77.97% - Brian Kelly (4 in the Big East at Cincy, 6th at Notre Dame): 75.68% - Nick Saban (5 at MSU, 5 at LSU, and 9th at Bama): 75.11% - Kevin Sumlin (in 4th at A&M, Houston doesn't count): 75% - (MARK RICHT GOES HERE) - Jim Mora (4th at UCLA): 73.33% - Les Miles (4 at Ok St., in 11th at LSU): 73.12% - Dabo Swinney (7th full season, 8th total at Clemson): 71.74% - Bobby Petrino (2 Big East seasons at Louisville, 5 at Arkansas, and in his 2nd at Louisville again): 70.21% - Mark Dantonio (2 Big East seasons at Cincy, in 9th at MSU): 68.15% - Mike Gundy (in 11th at Ok. St.): 67.16% - Gary Patterson (Only the last 3 seasons at TCU count, since that's how long they've been in a P5 conference): 65.91% - Hugh Freeze (4th at Ole Miss, Arky St doesn't count): 64.44% - Art Briles (8th at Baylor, Houston doesn't count): 63.83% \nSo, that's the top active head coaches list. And as you might have noticed, there are a couple of names favored by some fans to replace Mark Richt below him on that list. But let's look at a couple of other names some folks have tabbed as a potential Richt replacement on this blog and others:- Chip Kelly: The best non-current-college-head-coach name on the list, with a 86.79% winning percentage in 4 years at Oregon, and he's proably going to be fired by the Philadelphia Eagles. Unfortunately, he has a NCAA \"show-cause\" on him until January, so he effectively can't be hired as a head coach until then. Yeah, Georgia's athletic department will jump at a guy with that kind of baggage. (/rolls eyes)- Tom Herman: Most famous for being Urban Meyer's Mike Bobo at Ohio State. He's 5-0 in his first year at Houston, but what does that prove about... well, anything at all relative to his ability to recruit and coach in the SEC?- Kirby Smart: No head coaching experience... and in fact, no offensive coaching experience at all other than a 1-year stint as UGA's running backs coach in 2005. Yeah, he's Nick Saban's right hand man, and if you want to go ahead and advocate that we hire what would be UGA's version of Will Muschamp... well, then go right ahead.- Sonny Dykes: What? Didn't even have a great record at Louisiana Tech, and he's 11-19 so far at Cal.- Bob Stitt: Stitt is famous for being a head coach at Division II Colorado School of Mines, where he ran a completely new, ingenious style of offense and blew everybody's doors off, dominating the entire division. (Counsel leans over, whispers.) Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I'm told that he only had a 63.53% winning percentage at the Division II level, and he's 3-2 at Montana in his first year at the Division I FCS level. But wait! Stitt is loved by other offensive geniuses like Dana Holgorsen! Surely he knows what he's talking about, right? Well...- Dana Holgorsen (in 5th season at W.Va.): 55.36% \nLook, this isn't a whole article about potential candidates to replace Richt. My point is that even after starting the 2015 season 4-2, Mark Richt is still one of the best coaches in the college ranks today. And nobody that currently has a better record than Richt is even available as a realistic replacement. 11) Even the \"best\" coaches frequently lose 2 games a year \nThe usual refrain is, \"Mark Richt always loses at least 2 or 3 games a year, and the best coaches don't let their teams have that kind of lapse, so he can't win at the elite level.\" Well, let's just test that hypothesis. \nSo, we know that there are 8 currently active head coaches ahead of Mark Richt on the \"all-time winning percentage\" list above. How do those coaches... none of whom would be candidates for the head job at UGA, mind you... compare to Mark Richt in terms of \"always losing 2-3 games a year?\" \nThe 8 coaches ahead of Mark Richt on the active winning percentage list have combined for 51 seasons of 2 or more losses in a combined 74 seasons of coaching, for a total of 68.91% of the time. And that's giving these coaches the benefit of the doubt in 2015, since only one coach (Mark Helfrich) currently has at least 2 losses this season. But we're looking at this right now at this point in time, when everybody is talking about it, so we give them the benefit of the doubt. \nThose numbers are skewed by 2 coaches in particular: Urban Meyer and Jimbo Fisher. Urban's only had 4 seasons with 2 or more losses in his 10 seasons coaching at the Power 5 level, and Jimbo has only had 3 out of 6 seasons reach that 2-loss mark (again, including 2015 to this point). When you take those two coaches out, the remaining 6 coaches have combined for 44 seasons of 2+ losses in 58 total seasons coached, for a total of 75.86% . That's compared to 14 out of 15 seasons for Mark Richt, or 93.33% . But if we only consider full seasons for the 2+ loss mark (so, only numbers through 2014), that number drops to 44 out of 52 seasons, or 84.62% for the coaches above Richt, and 13 out of 14 seasons, or 92.86% for Richt. \nSo no, Mark Richt is not keeping pace with the 8 coaches above him on the active winning percentage list. But that's why those coaches are above him on the list. The point is that it's not a huge outlier. Even the glorious god almighty Nick Saban has had 2 or more losses in 73.68% of all the seasons he's coached at the Division I FBS level (14 out of 19 seasons). \nEvery coach has teams that have disappointing losses and bonehead games. Mark Richt is not unique in this aspect, and whomever you would choose to replace him would not be able to avoid this statistic, either. 10) Mark Richt has never had any serious trouble with the NCAA \nIn spite of the \"Mark Richt has lost control of...\" meme that is so popular, the fact is that in 15 years, the NCAA has never even hinted at putting the University of Georgia on probation. Hell, the most serious trouble Mark Richt has gotten into with the NCAA was in 2011, when it was discovered that he paid raises to his assistants out of his own pocket when those raises were denied by the Athletic Department. \nYou can turn this argument around and say that Mark Richt has allowed our athletic department to be too aggressive in enforcing NCAA rules, especially with regards to the Todd Gurley and A.J. Green incidents, but what you're arguing there is that Mark Richt tries too hard to obey the rules . Think about that for a moment. 9) Mark Richt graduates his players \nIf your response to this point is, \"I don't care about that, because I ain't come here to play school,\" then we're done talking. 90+% of all college football players will never go pro, and to simply exploit those players, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds, simply to win football games is reprehensible and exploitative. Of course winning football games is the goal, and of course every college player thinks they're going to make it in the NFL. \nThe reality, however, is that the vast majority of these players are going to have to do something that's not on a football field when their days are done playing for UGA. And under Mark Richt's tenure, those players are getting an education and life experiences that will help them be successful when they graduate, as most of them do. \nThe 2015 Football media guide, like most media guides, has a \"glossy photo\" section in the middle, where a lot of promotional \"stuff\" highlights all of the things we really want recruits to see. NFL players, pictures of stuff like Uncle Verne and Gary in Sanford Stadium, etc. That section is 36 pages long. Along the bottom of every single page is a picture of every football player who has graduated from the university since Mark Richt. There are an average of 8-9 pictures per page. For 36 pages. (That averages out to about 19-20 players per year, which is a very good number when you consider transfers, dismissals, and guys who left early for the draft.) 8) Mark Richt's former players love him \nJust watch any of the HBO \"Hard Knocks\" specials and see how many former Georgia players you see at some point wearing a \"Coach Richt is my Dawg\" t-shirt. To some extent, that's all you need to know right there. \nThese kids aren't stupid when they're in college. They can tell when they've got a coach that couldn't care less about their personal life as long as they're winning games. They can also tell when a coach genuinely cares for them and wants to see them succeed in both football and life, and the bonds coach Richt's players have with him even after their playing days says more for his relationship with those guys than I ever could. \n\"So what,\" you say? \"Who cares?\" Well, I'll tell you who cares about whether Mark Richt takes care of his players: the mommas and daddies of prospective recruits care. And so do (some of) the recruits themselves. Every single coach that steps into a recruit's living room is going to promise his momma that he would \"take care of (recruit's name) like he was my own son.\" But Mark Richt has a 15-year track record of doing exactly that, both in the good times and the hard times. That's a valuable tool to have on the recruiting trail. 7) Mark Richt goes above and beyond his duties to take care of his players after their careers are over \nAgain, even if you just simply don't care about a player after he leaves UGA, recruits do. (And recruits' mommas do, too.) Mark Richt has been informally helping connect players with opportunities and networking experiences for pretty much all of his career, but he started the Paul Oliver Network in 2014 to formalize the network in memory of DGD Paul Oliver who took his own life and was posthumously diagnosed with CTE. Oliver's situation was heart-achingly chronicled by Jeremy Collins for SB Nation less than a month ago, and he correctly points out that Oliver's CTE probably played just as much a role as anything else in his death. But the fact is Mark Richt is committed to these helping these men succeed in life, not just in football. And even if you just don't care and only tally wins and losses, that still matters, because it matters to the recruits you want to see playing in the Red and Black. 6) Continuity makes for a more successful program \nMark Richt has said it before, and it's no less true today; when you have a staff in place, as long as they continue to adapt competitively to changes in the game, then that continuity can be a great competitive advantage for your program. Let's take a look at the 15 football programs with the most wins over the last 10 years (prior to 2015, with number of wins in parentheses):- Boise State (113)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:53:50.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
