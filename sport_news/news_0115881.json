Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 7:00 AM By Mike MendezSports Editor Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 7:00 AM After losing a couple of games early in the season, the McPherson football team looks back on track, having won two in a row. The Bullpups will look for a third straight to finish out the non-district portion of the season with a trip south to Winfield. With a tough district looming, McPherson will be looking to continue building momentum. But the Vikings are far from a tune-up tomato can. The Vikings enter the game at 2-3, with two of the losses coming at the hands of state juggernauts Buhler and Silver Lake. Winfield is led by electric senior quarterback Brett Roark, who can beat defenses on the ground as well as through the air. Through the first five games, Roark has completed 23 passes for 374 yards and 2 touchdowns. But the McPherson defense will need to be prepared, because Roark is no one-trick pony. On the ground this year, he has racked up 220 yards on the ground on an average of nearly 4 yards per carry, and 4 rushing touchdowns. Roark is far from the only threat on the ground for Winfield. Senior Nathaniel Gale leads the team with 243 rushing yards. Junior Adam Keller only has 15 carries on the year, but has been a monster when he does get the ball, picking up 162 yards for an average of nearly 11 yards per carry, and has added 4 touchdowns to the Viking scoring. In the passing game, Layke Hoffman is a senior who has feasted this season. With only 13 catches, Hoffman has amassed 223 receiving yards for an Average of 17.2 yards per catch, and has 2 touchdown catches. Sophomore Kyle Sawyer has proven to be a big-play threat in the Winfield passing game, catching 2 passes for 85 yards. The Bullpups suffered a big blow, losing receiver Spencer Wine in Week 4 against Rose Hill. But last week in El Dorado, Wineâ€™s teammates picked him, and the team up. Filling in on special teams, Jack Reifschneider gave McPherson a huge boost with a 78-yard punt return for a touchdown that blew the game open for the Bullpups. In the passing game, Mikey Saverino showed up as a target for Casen Hoover, catching 3 passes for 84 yards. Jeff Reed caught 3 passes as well for McPherson. Noah Jirgens continues to be a reliable running back for the Bullpups, running for 114 yards against El Dorado last week. But since the Rose Hill game in Week 4, a new option has emerged with sophomore Austin Hunt. Against the Wildcats, Hunt carried the momentum from his big second half against the Rockets with a 78-yard game. In the last two games, Hunt has run for 155 yards. Defensively, McPherson held El Dorado to 7 points last week. It was the lowest points allowed for the Bullpups since beating Salina South 14-7 in Week 1.
