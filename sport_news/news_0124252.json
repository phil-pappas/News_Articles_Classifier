The water was dyed a startling red.\nA video, uploaded on Saturday, shows what appears to be a great white shark devouring a seal in the first recorded attack by the finned predator in the modern history of San Francisco Bay, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . It already has more than 500,000 views on YouTube.\nOne boy hummed the Jaws theme song over and over, as the shark’s fin came above water. “A frenzy!” he added.\nAs the shark disappeared below water once more, some bloody remains of the seal floated to the surface.\n“Its heart is floating away. Cool!” the boy said.\n“Guess we know what happened to the few escapees!” the caption on the video reads, referring to what may have been the only successful escape from the prison, more than half a century ago.\nThree prisoners, Frank Lee Morris and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, broke out of the maximum security prison in 1962 using papier-mache replica heads, tunnels and an inflatable raft. This later inspired the 1979 film Escape from Alcatraz , starring Clint Eastwood. Their fate, which remains unknown to this day, seemed perfectly clear to the tourists filming the bloody shark attack.\nThis year, the number of great whites seen near San Francisco has increased, according to the Chronicle. At least 15 adult sharks were spotted around Monterey Bay in June. Juvenile sharks were also seen in the area, a rare sight that far north. Sean Van Sommeran, the executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research Foundation in Santa Cruz, told the Chronicle that dozens of young sharks were spotted.\n“It’s the furthest north white shark pups have ever been documented,” he said.\nVan Sommeran added that the increase in shark sightings could be because of warmer waters caused by El Niño.\nDavid McGuire, director of local conservation group Shark Stewards, told the Chronicle that the chances of meeting a shark while in the San Francisco Bay are very low. He said that more than 80 people from the Dolphin Club and South End Rowing Club swam from Alcatraz last week with no incidents.\n“For me, it’s pretty exciting and a sign that health is returning to the San Francisco Bay ecosystem,” McGuire told the Chronicle. “I suspect this shark is well fed.”", "external_links": ["http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Tourists-record-great-white-shark-devouring-seal-6566229.php", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079116", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFumUdCSgOQ"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:41:03.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
