Juniors Ethan Freeman and Jeremy Paul once again paved the way for the Buffaloes, each carding a 4-under 67 to both finish at 4-under 209 for 54 holes. Paul set a school record Tuesday as his 67 was his 41st subpar round of his career (out of 86). \nSenior Philip Juel-Berg wrapped up his effort with a 3-under 68, giving him 1-over 214 for a 44th-place tie. Freshman Wilson Belk turned in an even-par 71 Tuesday to finish at 3-over 216, tying him for 55th. Freshman Ross Macdonald tied for 61st overall. \n\"We are very proud of the guys,\" CU head coach Roy Edwards said. \"Today was a very important round, and the guys responded very well. As we evolve and grow we will need to get more consistent but the low rounds are there and the consistency will come.\" \nThe Buffaloes' final tournament of the season is UCLA's Gifford Intercollegiate on November 2-4 in San Martin, Calif. \nResults Advertisement Buffalo Individuals \nT26.
