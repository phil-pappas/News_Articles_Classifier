(AP) â€” Jeb Bush is getting a jump on the so-called SEC primary by visiting the University of Tennessee and other campuses in Southern states that vote for the GOP's presidential nominee on March 1. \nOn Saturday, the former Florida governor gave a pitch for his candidacy before the Volunteers hosted No. 19 Georgia. \nBush spoke to hundreds of orange-clad fans who gathered for his speech two hours before the opening kickoff. \nAfter just a few minutes, Bush ended his remarks and pledged to take as many selfies as humanly possible. He spent the next half-hour or so doing just that. \nBush visited Georgia's campus Sept. 19 for the Bulldogs' game with South Carolina. In November, he is scheduled to attend LSU's game at Alabama and Mississippi's game at Mississippi State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:34:11.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
