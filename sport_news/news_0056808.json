He was named this week as Stewart's successor in the No. 14 Chevrolet. Stewart is retiring from Sprint Cup racing following the 2016 season. \nBowyer now has a ride with team owner Harry Scott in a deal that will give him a seat and likely team support from Stewart-Haas Racing. \nHScott Motorsports fielded Chevrolets this season for Justin Allgaier and Michael Annett. \nBowyer is 16th this season in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship standings. Barring a victory, Bowyer will not advance to the second round. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:52:58.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
