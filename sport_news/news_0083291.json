K-State’s best defense against TCU might be the ability to control the clock. A steady ground attack behind Justin Silmon and a mix of passes from QB Joe Hubener might be enough to keep TCU’s high-caliber offense off the field and give the Cats’ defense a chance to rest. To win the time-of-possession battle, K-State has to protect the ball and avoid turnovers. K-State also has to be better on third down, where it was 4 of 11 last week at Oklahoma State \n...When the Horned Frogs have the ball TCU’s offense is led by Heisman hopeful Trevone Boykin, whose numbers at QB rank among the top in the country. Boykin can do it with his arm or his legs, ranking No. 1 in the country with 19 passing TDs this season, while lighting up the Wildcats’ defense for 123 rushing yards and three touchdowns last season. The Horned Frogs’ ground attack is led by Aaron Greene who is rushing for 100 yards a game, while Josh Doctson is putting up some of the best numbers in the country at WR with eight TDs. \n...On special teams K-State’s return game has been solid this season behind Morgan Burns and Dominique Heath, but both were injured last week at OSU and their status for this week’s game is unknown. Burns has returned nine kicks for 303 yards this season, including a 100-yard TD in Week 1. Heath has a 58-yard punt return to his name. Andre Davis is the only other player to return a punt for the Wildcats this season, while Dalvin Warmack is the only other player with a significant kick return. RELATED ARTICLE Backup RB Green runs wild in TCU win \nWhile TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin was busy cementing himself as a frontrunner in the Heisman race, the Horned Frogs’ backup running back Aaron Green was busy carving up the Kansas State defense in his own right. \nBoasting one of the nation’s top offenses and an early season Heisman candidate in Trevone Boykin, TCU is about to serve up the biggest challenge Kansas State’s defense has seen this season. \nComing off a game in which the Wildcats allowed Oklahoma State to throw for 441 yards, they will now face the nation’s fourth-best passing offense (396.4 per game) and the man who leads the nation in touchdown passes with 19. \nK-State coach Bill Snyder said they have to play better defensively this week against the high-powered Horned Frogs. \n“We have to be able to defend against the pass better and we have to go up and make some plays on deep-thrown balls,” he said. “They have a wealth of talent coming back. They are experienced on offense. I think they have eight or nine starters coming back, and obviously, Boykin and the receivers. You cannot overlook the fact that they run the ball extremely well because they have good balance in their offense. \n“They ran for 336 (yards) against us last year, so we have to be able to defend both. It’s just what you have to do.” \nTCU’s offense is even better than it was a year ago, when the Wildcats and Horned Frogs played in a matchup of Top 10-ranked teams in Fort Worth, Texas. Boykin and Aaron Green led the 336-yard rushing attack by each rushing for 100 yards, as the Horned Frogs pulled back on their passing game and beat the Wildcats, 41-20, on the ground. \nSenior linebacker Will Davis said they went into last season’s game ready for a long night of defending the pass. Instead, TCU ran it at them and around them all night. \n“Last year going into the game I remember they were throwing the ball a lot and they decided to run against us and we gave up a lot of yards,” Davis said. “We know what they can do running the ball. Green is a great back. Boykin can pull it down anytime. It will be a challenge for us.” \nGreen has rushed for 504 yards and six touchdowns this year, while Boykin has gone for 242 yards and two touchdowns. The Horned Frogs have racked up 1,168 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns in five games. \nBoykin has been a bigger threat through the air, throwing for 1,802 yards and 19 touchdowns. Along with his NCAA-leading number of touchdown passes, he ranks second in total offense, fourth in total passing yards and third in points responsible for per game. \nSnyder gave Boykin the ultimate compliment, calling him the complete quarterback in his eyes. \n“I think back maybe two years ago, everybody knew he could run around well, but the word was that he couldn’t throw the ball,” he said. “I’ve never felt that way. I always thought he could throw it. He’s got a good arm. His accuracy is 64 percent and that’s not bad considering he throws so many of his balls down field.” \nBoykin is a Heisman candidate for the second year, and Davis said it’s no surprise with his playmaking ability. Davis said Boykin is a clear winner that can make plays with his feet and his arm, making him tough to deal with for the defense. \nThe Horned Frogs have had a top target for Boykin in the seemingly unstoppable Josh Doctson, who ranked second in NCAA in receiving yards per game. Doctson has 42 catches for 722 yards and eight touchdowns. \nSophomore linebacker Elijah Lee said the TCU offense is full of players who can make game-changing plays. \n“They are a team that can go fast, and if you are not paying attention, they will go deep on you no matter what the time is,” Lee said. “So you always have to be ready for that deep ball.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:17:11.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
