They're pitching it as the definitive Jackson biography, and \"MJ\" makes an excellent case for that, shot through as it is with critical deconstructions, a historian's perspective and an objective but lively tone.\nWe talked to Knopper, 46, at his Highland neighborhood home about the process of writing the book, his inspirations along the way and why he's convinced Jackson is innocent of the most heinous allegations against him.\nQ: Why Michael Jackson? A lot of people might assume there's not much new information, given the dozens of books already out there about him.\nA: There are, but there hasn't really been a book that's credible. Not a salacious tell-all, but a narrative, music-business book. I kind of pitched it as the Peter Guralnick version of Michael Jackson's story. He's the guy that did the Elvis Presley biographies (\"Last Train to Memphis\"), and those books are great because there's a lot of dirt in there, a lot of sexy stuff. But in addition to that, it's high-level criticism and analysis, and you don't come away from that going, \"Wow, Peter Guralnick is really a cheap celebrity biographer.\" That's what I aspired to.\nQ: There is certainly no shortage of entry points into Michael Jackson's life and art.\nA: It has everything. If you cover baseball you want to do the Babe Ruth biography. If you cover politics you want to write about Lincoln or Obama or somebody who's got some heft. As I was doing this, I was marveling at how many different eras (Jackson) touched. I can't think of any precedent. He starts out on the south side of Chicago being influenced by blues and James Brown, then he goes to Motown, then Philly International. Then he works with Quincy Jones — who touches everything — then he kind of moves onto hip-hop. His career spans the history of pop music.\nQ: How did your opinion of Jackson evolve?\nA: Most of the books that have come out about Michael, and there are some very good ones, have been like, \"I'm going to get this guy. I'm going to nail down all the weird details and not let him squirm under these half-truths.\" And of course I wanted to tell the truth, too. But my feeling was that I didn't want to get this guy. I wanted it to be sympathetic to what his life was like. But I didn't expect to be so thoroughly convinced of his innocence on child molestation charges.\nQ: What convinced you?\nA: It's media-driven, because he was just crushed by tabloids and cable TV news in the post-O.J. era. People went into those events and into his trial — and this is documented — saying \"He's guilty, we're going to get this guy.\" I interviewed unbiased journalists with the same observations. He was declared innocent by a nonpartial jury in 2005, which I do not think was scammed or bought in any way. The prosecution against him was very aggressive and well-funded. And I just don't think the evidence is there to overcome that ruling. The people who accused him are the wrong people.\nQ: What about his artistic prowess?\nA: I always thought of him as a singer and dancer, a contemporary of Madonna. And he was. But now I think of him like Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. He would hear whole symphonies in his head. And he wasn't an instrumentalist, so what he had to do throughout his career was communicate to these hired hands who would translate it to an instrument. And the ultimate person who did that was Quincy Jones.\nQ: You capture some pretty incredible moments from that relationship.\nA: I had a source leak me some tapes of Michael and Quincy talking right after \"The Wiz\" (in 1978). And Quincy's eloquent, but he's a rambler. And Michael speaks very sparingly. (Jackson) would do a lot of \"Mmmm ... hmmm ... interesting.\" And sometimes he would go \"Woo!\" which is hilarious. But there's this moment where Michael says, \"I hear stuff in my head.\" And there's this pause. And Quincy goes, \"You know, Michael, if you hear stuff in your head, I can write that stuff down for you.\" And it felt like that was the moment that the Michael and Quincy partnership happened. I was like \"Wow, I got to hear that.\"\nQ: I like that you begin the book with an anecdote that illustrates how segregated and hostile his hometown of Gary, Ind., was while he was growing up. It grounds the subject and differentiates your approach from other writing on Jackson.\nA: I used to work for the Gary, Ind., newspaper in the mid-'90s and grew up in Detroit, and the whole story of some of those Midwestern cities is one of race and segregation and institutional racism. There's a James Brown book by RJ Smith called \"The One\" that really delves into the history of racism and slavery and ties it back to the subject, and I wanted to do that. I mean, the story of everything in the U.S. is the story of race and segregation — certainly the entire history of American popular music.\nJohn Wenzel: 303-954-1642, jwenzel@denverpost.com or @johnwenzel\n\"MJ: THE GENIUS OF MICHAEL JACKSON\"\nReading and book signing by Denver author Steve Knopper. 7 p.m. Oct. 28 at the Tattered Cover, 2526 E.
