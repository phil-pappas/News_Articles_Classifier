Gregg Popovich, who has led the San Antonio Spurs to five NBA titles, will replace Mike Krzyzewski as the U.S. basketball coach following the 2016 Olympics.\nUSA Basketball said Friday that Popovich will take over starting with 2017 training camp and lead the Americans into the 2019 Basketball World Cup and 2020 Olympics if they qualify.\nRegarded as one of the game’s best coaches, Popovich was the choice when USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo decided to return to an NBA coach. Krzyzewski has led the Americans since 2005.\nThe Duke coach has guided the U.S. to consecutive Olympic gold medals and two world titles. He will stay on as a special adviser to Colangelo.\nPopovich was a U.S. assistant in the 2002 world championships and 2004 Olympics, the low point for U.S. basketball. Colangelo was hired to assemble the national team program following the bronze medal in Athens.
