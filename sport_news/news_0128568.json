Fog is forming as of 5:30 a.m. in areas west and south of the city. But the widespread fog event of yesterday is unlikely to repeat today.\nExpect some high clouds through the morning and then full sun by early afternoon. Highs today should be a degree or two warmer topping out at 72.\nWednesday's temperatures should be similar with more clouds. On Thursday a thermal low begins to build causing an off shore flow and warmer temps. Forecasters are looking for Thursday and Friday to be warmer than average for this time of year.\nThe weekend, currently, looks rainy.
