RPI relied on its running game that accounted for 239 yards on 53 carries, including Nick Schlatz 's two-yard run with 4:20 left to give the Engineers a 35-21 lead. \nRPI (5-2, 3-1 Liberty League) is a half-game behind St. Lawrence (5-1, 3-0) in the conference standings with three games to play, although St. Lawrence holds the tiebreaker advantage with its 24-21 win over RPI last week. \nRPI rushed for just 50 yards in the loss to St. Lawrence and came into the Rochester game intent on establishing its ground game, which it did, holding the ball for 35:34. It kept the Yellowjackets' offense, which came in averaging just less than 32 points per game, off the field. \n\"Anytime you are able to move a man against his will, that is what running the football is,\" RPI coach Ralph Isernia said. \"The yardage really wears down a defense and it wears you down psychologically as well because there is not a whole lot you can do about it.\" \nRPI took a 14-7 halftime lead, keyed by an 84-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Johnny Ramsdell . The Engineers had three interceptions, two by Phil Lanieri III and another by Greenlidge, and opened the second half with a 15-play, 94-yard drive that was capped by Matt Lane 's two-yard touchdown run. \nThirteen plays on the drive were rushes, including nine by Schlatz, who finished with a team-high 116 yards on 27 carries and two touchdowns. \n\"We're a ground-it-out type of team,\" Schlatz said. \"Today we found what was working and we stuck with it. The linemen on this team are my best friends, they do their job and I do mine. When you get 13 runs on a drive, everyone is doing their job.\" \nRPI was especially effective on third downs, converting 11 of 20 chances. It ran 86 plays on offense compared to 71 for Rochester (4-2, 2-2). \nSean Martin , a local freelance writer, is a frequent contributor to the Times Union .
