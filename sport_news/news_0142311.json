Children love the Turtles, and so do adults who watched them on TV and in movies when they were kids, he says.\nGirls are expected to choose costumes based on the Disney TV movie, \"The Descendants,\" the story of the children of Disney characters such as Cruella De Vil and Cinderella.\nAdult costumes and accessories based on TV shows like \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Orange Is the New Black\" are expected to sell well. Costumes based on superheroes like the Avengers or Batman should also be brisk sellers, Silverstein says.\nAnd as usual, corsets and skimpy outfits for women are likely to attract a lot of partygoers. Risque costumes are big Halloween sellers.\nFor those with gorier tastes, Halloween fare also includes bloodied zombies and ghouls and characters from slasher movie classics like \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Friday the 13th.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
