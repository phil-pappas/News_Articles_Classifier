The Exeter High School boys soccer team’s three-game homestand with Pinkerton, Salem and Bedford to close the regular season was certain to bring some meaningful games to William Ball Stadium. Here it comes today against first-place Bedford. For the Blue Hawks, the payoff for winning this came could be huge. They remained in the hunt for a top-four seed with Tuesday’s 3-1 win over Salem, and getting there would guarantee a road to the Division I championship paved with FieldTurf, the same stuff they play on at home. Seeds 1 through 4 host preliminary and quarterfinal games, so long as they advance. The semifinals will be played on the turf at Stellos Stadium in Nashua this season, and ditto for the championship game at Southern New Hampshire University. “Home-field advantage really means a lot,” said Exeter forward Keenan Wittman, who added of his eight senior classmates: “And also — we’re seniors. This is our last year. Senior year, we should definitely make the most of it.” A win here today would be the perfect sendoff. Bedford (13-1-1) has clinched the top seed in Division I, thanks to its 2-1, head-to-head win over Hanover. The Bulldogs haven’t allowed a goal over six straight wins since their lone defeat, a 2-1 loss to Concord on Sept. 29. Overall, they’ve posted shutouts in 12 of their 13 wins and have surrendered a grand total of five goals. “It’s going to be the toughest one probably that we’ve had all year,” Exeter captain Dan Weinhold said, “so it’s going to take a lot of mental toughness as well as physical toughness. “We really want to get passing within our first couple touches,” the senior added, “keep the ball moving, and if we can do that against Bedford I think we’ll have a good chance.” Exeter’s chances of cracking the top-four could have been better. The Hawks recently suffered a 1-0 defeat to Pinkerton (7-6-2), which is the league’s 11th and final team that’s currently over .500. The Blue Hawks, at 11-4, will need a win over Bedford and some outside help, most conveniently a Timberlane (10-5) win over Londonderry (11-2-2); that would bring the Lancers and Blue Hawks into a tie with 48 points, with Exeter’s 2-1 win at Londonderry in September looming large. “Pinkerton was a great game and we really played well,” Exeter coach Jim Tufts said. “I really think it came down to — they were tougher than we were. They needed it more. They were going to get to .500, and they needed it and you could see it in the way they played. I think that was the difference in the game, because I think we had better chances but didn’t win it.” If a 10-win team can get a wake-up call, that game was it for the Blue Hawks. They thoroughly controlled a top-eight team in Salem (8-5-2) on Tuesday, scoring twice in the first half and taking a 3-0 lead into the final minute. The Blue Devils scored a meaningless goal with 48 seconds, capitalizing in the aftermath of a penalty kick. “Coach talked to all the seniors before in the locker and just said —‘You guys need to lead them today,’” Exeter senior Jack Carr said of Tufts. “This is your last season and these are your last three home games. I think it really worked, that talk before the game. The truth is, everybody is fighting for a home spot. We’re top-five right now, but you never know if it’s going to stay that way.” The Blue Hawks sure hope so. Their sights are set on that top-four spot, which would keep them from playing another tough road game, potentially on grass, in the quarterfinals. Three years ago they were denied on a cold and rainy Sunday in Londonderry in the quarters. In 2013, they got back there and fell at a tough Concord team. Last season, another run ended in the quarters after a two-hour trek to perennial power Hanover. “We’ve been stuck with going on the road in that five spot (in recent seasons), and we could help ourselves,” Tufts said. “So we’ll see.” By Ryan O'Leary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:48:25.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
