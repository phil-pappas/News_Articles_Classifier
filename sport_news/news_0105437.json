In the last four games against the Patriots, the Colts run defense has been embarrassing. New England has averaged 193 rushing yards per game in those games, and have averaged 4.98 yards per carry in that stretch. In short? The Indy run defense has been ground to a fine dust as backs like LeGarrette Blount and Jonas Gray have redefined physical football. In those games, the bulk of the workload has been via Blount, as the big back rumbled for 166 yards and four touchdowns in a 2013 playoff game against Indy. He followed that up with 177 yards and three touchdowns in last year’s AFC title game. Those performances were sandwiched around the memorable 37-carry, 201-yard effort on the part of Gray last November, a game where the Patriots frequently utilized an extra tight end (Cameron Fleming) as a way to punish the Colts’ run defense. And given their performances this season -- even without a remade offensive line that won’t include left tackle Nate Solder , who is now out for the season with a biceps injury -- there’s little reason to think that the Patriots won’t be able to do the same thing this time around. After missing Week 1, the 6-foot-1, 245-pound Blount has returned to his bruising ways with 78 yards and three touchdowns against Jacksonville in Week 3. He followed that with 74 yards on just 13 carries last Sunday against the Cowboys. On the season, he’s blasted his way to 4.7 yards per carry. His backfield mate is even more dangerous. In his first season with New England, the 5-foot-8. 195-pound Dion Lewis is only one of five backs with at least 150 yards rushing and receiving over first five weeks of the season, and his Matrix-style disappearing act on a 10-yard touchdown catch against the Cowboys has already become the stuff of Internet legend. In all, Lewis has 36 carries for 180 yards and two touchdowns on the ground, while adding 23 catches for 238 yards and a touchdown as a pass catcher. Regardless of how the matchup might appear on paper, Blount stood in front of his locker on Wednesday, and with a straight face, declared the Colts to be a better defense than the ones the Patriots have seen the last few years. “They’re a really good defense -- they’ve improved. They look better. They’ve been good this season,” he said. “We just have to keep working on figuring out their weakness and try to exploit them.” He added: “They’ve added different players. There are some different players out there -- different names. But all in all, they’re a good defense. We’ll try and dissect them.” Given the history of the last few games between the Patriots and Colts, dissecting them shouldn’t be an issue. The numbers are better this season, but that’s only because they couldn’t get any worse. Through five games in 2015, Indy is 18th in the league in run defense, having yielded an average of 112 rushing yards per game. Last Thursday’s narrow win over Houston was the second game in three weeks in which the Colts held an opponent to under 90 rushing yards, and allowed their yards per carry average to fall to 3.5, fourth-best in the NFL. Of course, that includes two games where they’ve yielded 140 yards or more on the ground (including 147 rushing yards against the Bills in the opener and 142 rushing yards against the Jaguars), so you have to take the “ improvements ” with a grain of salt. “They’re leading the league in negative plays against the run,” Patriots coach Bill Belichick said when asked about the Indy run defense. “They’ve done a good job.” “We’ve gotten better and our numbers are better -- I’m not a bean counter,” said Indy head coach Chuck Pagano when asked about the statistical improvements in the run defense. “I think our front seven interior linemen have played well to this point. I think they’re gaining confidence and playing better. “We all know what’s transpired and that’s in the past and that’s history. This team hasn’t really played that team, and they got some different players and we got some different players, but I like the direction we’re going,” he added. “We’re going to have to be outstanding come Sunday night.” Deflategate aside, Lewis has a chance to deliver some payback of his own to Pagano and the Colts. The undersized back spent less than a week with Indy last year before being cut loose by Pagano. The Colts coach wasn’t interested in going in depth on that decision Wednesday, only saying he “didn’t recall” Lewis’ time with Indy, but added that Lewis is a “matchup nightmare.” “I’m not really trying to get into that,” Lewis said Wednesday when asked if he got a fair shot in Indy. “I’m just focusing on this week and this game.” In the end, Indy might be at the rare stage where its hoping for Tom Brady to throw the ball, lest the Colts’ defense try and go 12 rounds with Blount and Lewis on Sunday night. While history says the Patriots aren’t relying on their past track record of success on the ground heading into Sunday’s game -- and the names and faces have changed -- it’s hard to imagine the New England offense straying too much from a formula that has worked so well against the Colts in recent years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:48:04.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
