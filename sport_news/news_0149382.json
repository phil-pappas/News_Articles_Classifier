They’re as close to our concept of perfect as we can get, which is part of why we worship them so. Then there is the antihero, the person you root for despite their flaws and mistakes. They’re far from perfect, often succeeding through questionable means, and representing what we’d like to see happen rather than what really should happen. Antiheroes are nothing new. You can trace them back to the works of Homer, and literature is full of figures like Don Quixote, Dean Moriarty or Holden Caulfield. In the 1960s, counterculture figures like Cool Hand Luke gave the antihero purpose, while maintaining their cool factor. Television over the past decade has been littered with characters like Tony Soprano, Vic Mackey, Jack Bauer and Walter White — guys you shouldn’t root for, but you do — and the result has been a new Golden Age for TV dramas. The hero is revered; the antihero is relatable. When Tom Brady took on Roger Goodell and the NFL machine, it was reminiscent, for pro wrestling fans, of the WWE’s “Attitude Era” of the late '90s. Wrestling soared to new heights of popularity behind the emergence of the character of “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, who literally and figuratively gave the middle finger to Vince McMahon and the corporate culture. What regular Joe didn’t fantasize about being able to stick it to The Man and get one over on management? Austin was the living, breathing, grappling embodiment of rebellion, and fans ate it up. When he survived everything McMahon could throw at him and still succeeded in winning multiple championships, his popularity continued to grow. Austin was the antihero, and one of the first true such figures in sports or sports entertainment. The NFL had figures like Joe Namath and Jim Brown, guys who’d speak their mind, but the league never had someone that would challenge authority like Austin was, albeit in scripted storylines. But pro wrestling also has another trend that lends perfectly to the NFL—the idea of the “cool heel.” It’s a character that is clearly a bad guy, yet wins the fans over at the same time and becomes beloved for his antics. Back when Dwayne Johnson was The Rock, he was the epitome of the cool heel, and now he’s America’s action-movie sweetheart. The very same “cool heel” persona is what works for players like Richard Sherman or Randy Moss. Brady, on the other hand, was a different story. He was a true babyface, the ultimate “good guy.” He had it all — talent, good looks, a supermodel wife and more money that he could ever spend, even if he’s currently earning the “bargain” rate of $9 million per year. Outsiders viewed it as the perfect life, right down to the dimple in his chin (which Bart Scott recently said makes him a “superhero,” although he said it derogatorily) and the gleam in his eye. And lot of people hated him for that. If Brady wasn’t your quarterback, he was easy to dislike. Remember the beard? His Justin Beiber hairstyle? His spokesman work for male Uggs? That gave ammunition to the Brady haters. But, above all, they hated him for the one thing that really matters. He won. A lot. People wanted to see him fail, but there wasn’t a lot of failure over the years. Sure, the Patriots lost some games, including two Super Bowls, but Brady has still had a Hall of Fame career with four championship rings. He was the poster boy for the NFL. In a society full of the disinterested and disillusioned, the only thing we do with a poster is throw darts at it. Yet an interesting thing is happening with Brady — his haters are becoming fans. Because he, too, stuck it to “The Man,” beating the NFL in federal court and avoiding his four-game suspension for Deflategate, he’s won over a lot of people who always wished they could win in a battle with the boss. Suddenly, Brady has become relatable. Brady’s No. 12 has been the top-selling NFL jersey here in the early goings of the season, which comes as a huge shock considering the hatred fans of other teams were expressing against him and the “Cheatriots” since the AFC Championship Game. He’s in his 16th season, so most of New England already has their Brady jersey — or in some cases, jerseys, as in a complete set of home, away and red throwbacks — so it’s not just Patriots fans that have propelled him to the top of the list. Fans of other teams are admiring him for sticking to his guns, even if they still think he was somehow involved in the deflation of footballs. When Under Armour debuted their new ad campaign with Brady during Week 1, the quarterback was wearing a t-shirt with the numbers “199” in the commercial, alluding to the fact that he was the 199th overall pick in the 2000 NFL Draft. Even though the shirt wasn’t something Under Armour planned on producing, the demand was so great that they finally did, and sold out immediately. Even the NFL is back on the Brady bandwagon, naming him the Offensive Player of the Month for September, after snubbing him for Player of the Week honors in Week 2 in favor of the less-impressive Ben Roethlisberger. Perhaps Brady has reached true antihero status across the NFL, and we’ll start seeing No. 12 jerseys and “199” T-shirts scattered throughout visiting stadiums. Or maybe Goodell bought them all up and is planning to burn them in effigy. Either would be a pretty cool thing to see. Tim Weisberg covers the New England Patriots for The Standard-Times.
