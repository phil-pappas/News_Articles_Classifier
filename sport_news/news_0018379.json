Columbiana’s 34-28 victory ended when Connor Stacey intercepted Josh Liberati’s pass in the Blue Devils’ overtime possession. \n“This crew is pretty amazing,” Columbiana coach Bob Spaite said. “They care about each other pretty tremendously. \n“They work their tail off,” Spaite said. “There is only 30 of us — we have a bunch of guys that didn’t go out. We have a bunch of guys that moved away — starters that moved away. It’s not their fault. It’s just the way it goes.” \nQuarterback Mitch Davidson continued to show why he’s the best quarterback in the league with 349 yards passing — 209 of those were to Jacob Ward. \n“We’re blessed with a great trigger man and a group of guys that can catch the football,” Spaite said. “We have an offensive line that has gotten so much better. \n“Our defense has gotten better each week.” \nLisbon (7-1, 2-1) started strong, opening up leads of 7-0, 21-7 and 28-21. Jason Thompson finished with 316 yards rushing. \nBut the Blue Devils had four turnovers which negated the running game that was at 305 yards at the half. \n“We wanted to control the ball, but turnovers hurt us,” Lisbon head coach Jim Tsilimos said. \nAfter Lisbon scored first, the Clippers (7-1, 2-0) tied the game at 7-7 when Davidson found Ward on for a 14-yard touchdown pass. \nThe Blue Devils continued pounding the ball with Thompson gashing the Clippers’ defense for a 21-7 lead midway through the second quarter. \n“What I said on the sideline isn’t fit for print,” Spaite said. “He’s [Thompson] a good back. They’re a good football team. They weren’t 7-0 for nothing. \n“They aren’t that way by accident. It’s on purpose. Jim Tsilimos has done a great job with a group of guys. Let’s give credit where credit’s due.” \nAfter a 78-yard scoring march, the Clippers took advantage of a Blue Devils’ fumble at the Columbiana 49. \nDavidson found Ward for a 57-yard touchdown reception for a 21-21 tie at halftime. \n“We made a couple of adjustments to slow Thompson down and we bracket their tight end [Austin Rutecki],” Spaite said. “He was their go-to guy. We had some trouble with the matchup early on.” \nThe Blue Devils scored on the first possession of the second half for a 28-21 lead. \nIn the fourth quarter, Davidson’s fourth touchdown pass tied the game, 28-28. This one covered 42 yards to Ward. \nAfter the Clippers scored in overtime and missed on the conversion try, penalties pushed the Blue Devils back to midfield where Liberati was picked on fourth down. \n“That game could have [gone] either way,” Spaite said. “My heart was in my shoes when they [missed] the extra point. I said please don’t let us lose a game on that. Don’t let us lose a game after the way we battled. Prayers are answered sometimes I guess. \n“Turnovers were big and I know that’s clich ,” Spaite said. “When two teams are evenly matched, that is what turns the game.” \nEric Fortune contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:19:02.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
