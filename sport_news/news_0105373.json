But you can't respect something you don't understand,\" Learned said.\nThat is why for the second year in a row, they've partnered with the Chiefs for American Indian Heritage Month. The goal is to educate fans, like Peak, on ways to show their team spirit in a respectful way.\n\"Make fans aware of the traditional struggles of American Indians and some of the rituals and heritage that are uniquely indigenous to Native American people,\" said Bill Chapin, senior vice president of business operations for the Chiefs.\nWhile Peak appreciates the education, he says he'll continue to wear his head dress.\n\"I don't think this was meant to be offensive. This is meant to stand by our team and to be part of everything,\" he said.\nAnd Learned knows it will take time but hopes that with more education more understanding from fans will come.\n\"With a better understanding of how we feel as Native Americans, that change can happen and it will be good for everyone,\" he said.\nMembers of the American Indian Community Working Group participated in a number of moments before Sunday's game at Arrowhead, including the presentation of the colors.\nThe national anthem was performed by members of the Chicksaw Nation Youth Choir. A drum mallet was also presented to former Chiefs player Tony Gonzalez in addition to an honor song performed during the pregame. \nTribes attending Sunday's game included Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Chickasaw Nation, Kaw Nation, Modoc Tribe, Peoria Tribe, Quapaw Tribe, Shawnee Tribe and Wyandotte Nation.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
