Smith/JSU Communications) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTHE SETUP \nIt will be interesting to see how the Tigers respond in their first game after Harold Jackson was fired as coach. Receivers coach Derrick McCall is now in the interim coach role and has preached offensive balance, accountability and limiting big plays on defense. This matchup will be JSU’s first game against a SWAC East Division opponent, which should be welcome since the division is the weaker of the conference’s two. \nAlabama A&M enters this game on a two-game losing streak. The Bulldogs give up about seven points per game less than the Tigers, but score nearly six points less. Both of these teams are getting outscored by 21 to 22 points per game. This will also be Alabama A&M’s first game against an East opponent. \n3 THINGS WE’RE TALKING ABOUT \nWhat can you expect from JSU? \nBulldogs coach James Spady said earlier this week that he doesn't know what to expect from the Tigers. He said they’ll approach this game like an opening game of the season. McCall said the bye week was basically like the start of training camp for his team and that this game will essentially have a first-game feel for JSU, too. \nWill the Tigers be balanced? \nEarlier this week when McCall was asked what his biggest concern on offense was, he said it was the lack of balance with the run game. The Tigers haven’t been able to demonstrate that they can run the ball on a consistent basis, except for the Texas Southern game. JSU’s top three backs combined for just eight carries against Grambling. Expect those carries to rise against Alabama A&M. \nWhat will look different on defense? \nThe approach on defense through the first five games wasn’t working as JSU surrendered 48.8 points per game. McCall said he wants to see in-game adjustments made by his defensive staff right away, not at halftime. The interim coach also stressed the importance of the defensive line generating pressure, so they don’t have to blitz and stunt as much, which could leave them vulnerable to big plays. \nGAME-DAY DATA \nWhere: Louis Crews Stadium, Huntsville, Alabama \nTelevision: N/A \nRecord: Jackson State 1-4, 1-2.
