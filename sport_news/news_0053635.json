After Colin Kaepernick guided San Francisco during the field for what looked like a game-winning touchdown with less than two minutes to go in the contest, Eli Manning did the same exact thing for New York and capped it off with this amazing touchdown pass to Larry Donnell :\nIt was a big win for the Giants—and apparently, a really big win for Odell Beckham Jr. , who hauled in seven passes for 121 yards and a touchdown during the game. Beckham Jr. injured his hamstring during the fourth quarter of the game and didn’t play much of a role during the Giants’ final drive, but that didn’t stop him from getting very emotional during a post-game interview with NBC. He almost cried while speaking with Michele Tafoya :\nQuestion is: Why was he almost crying? The Giants’ win over the 49ers was important as it propelled them to the top of the NFC East . But was it cry-on-national-TV important? Probably not, but it’s good to see how important it was to Beckham Jr. Anyone who thought he was going to lose focus and fall off after his huge rookie season is quickly learning otherwise.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[ via NJ.com ]", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/e03t7imgqZW/embed/simple", "https://vine.co/v/e03d9LrOPBw/embed/simple", "http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/10/watch_giants_odell_beckham_jr_nearly_cries_after_w.html", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:22:15.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
