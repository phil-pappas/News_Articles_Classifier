Florida's Grier suspended 1 year for positive PED test In this photo taken Oct. 15, 2015, Florida quarterback Will Grier (7) picks himself up after taking a hit in the second half of an NCAA college football game against Missouri in Columbia, Mo. A person familiar with the situation says Grier has been suspended indefinitely for violating the NCAA's policy on banned drugs. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the school has not announced the decision. Grier is considering an appeal.
