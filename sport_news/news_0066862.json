LOUIS -- The Cubs will return to Wrigley Field with momentum on their side and Jake Arrieta on the mound Monday for Game 3 of the National League Division Series against the Cardinals.\nOne night after being shut out at Busch Stadium, the Cubs jumped on the Cardinals for five second-inning runs on the way to a 6-3 victory to even the series at one game apiece.\nThe Cubs hadn't faced left-hander Jaime Garcia in the regular season, a factor manager Joe Maddon said might give the Cardinals pitcher the edge. It didn't.\nHe allowed five unearned runs on four hits over two innings before Cardinals manager Mike Matheny went to Lance Lynn in relief. The Cardinals later reported that Garcia left the game due to a stomach virus.\nThe Cardinals committed two errors in the second inning, the second when Garcia fielded a bunt and instead of going home to catch Austin Jackson scoring, threw it into right field. Addison Russell's sacrifice bunt and Dexter Fowler's infield single drove in the next two runs before Jorge Soler's two-run homer to center field.\nThey added a run in the third off Lynn on Miguel Montero's RBI groundout.\nThe Cardinals had taken early 1-0 lead on Matt Carpenter's leadoff homer against right-hander Kyle Hendricks. That ended a streak of 13 straight scoreless innings pitched by Hendricks to end the regular season.\nHendricks settled down over the next three innings but gave up back-to-back homers to Kolten Wong and Randal Grichuk in the fifth to end his night. Maddon went to Travis Wood to keep the Cardinals in check, and he pitched 21/3 scoreless innings.\nBefore the game, Maddon gave fans permission to worry after a 4-0 loss Friday. But worry, he said, is for the barrooms and the chat rooms, not the clubhouse.\n\"I'm always about fans worrying; go ahead and worry as much as you'd like,\" Maddon said. \"From our perspective, we have to just go out and play the game like we always do. I'm here to tell you, man, I just can't live that way. The line I've used is I don't vibrate at that frequency. ... The process is fearless. If you want to always live your life just based on the outcome, you're going to be fearful a lot. And when you're doing that, you're really not living in a particular moment.\n\"If you take care of the seconds, the minutes, the hours in a day take care of themselves. So for our fans back home, please go ahead and be worried. That's OK. But understand that from our perspective in the clubhouse, we're more worried about the process than the outcome.\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735857&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735857&h=Cubs+top+Cardinals+6%2D3+to+even+NLDS+at+1%2D1", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735857"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:25:49.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
