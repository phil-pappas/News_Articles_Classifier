He is the most senior UEFA official not currently suspended, with president Michel Platini provisionally banned after receiving a payment of two million Swiss Francs from FIFA president Sepp Blatter in 2011.\nVillar headed up meetings at the UEFA ExCo last week in Platini's absence.\nA statement from the investigatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee read: \"Proceedings relating to the two officials Angel Maria Villar Llona and Franz Beckenbauer have already been passed on to the adjudicatory chamber. For procedural reasons, no further names of other parties affected by the proceedings are currently being disclosed.\n\"Under the FIFA Code of Ethics, pursuant to the presumption of innocence, the investigatory chamber shall examine all circumstances of the cases equally. In this sense, all parties are presumed innocent until a decision has been passed by the adjudicatory chamber.\"\nThe investigatory chamber also confirmed it would do \"everything in its power\" to ensure decisions on Platini and Blatter, who is also forbidden from carrying out any football-related activities, would be taken within the 90-day suspension period. Platini is a declared candidate for the FIFA presidential elections to be staged on February 26 as he seeks to replace Blatter at the head of world football.\nThe statement added: \"The investigatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee has confirmed that proceedings are ongoing against FIFA president Joseph Blatter and UEFA president Michel Platini, both of whom are currently provisionally suspended. The investigation is focusing on a payment of Swiss Francs 2 million from FIFA to Michel Platini in February 2011.\n\"The investigatory chamber will do everything in its power to ensure that a decision can be taken by the adjudicatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, chaired by Hans-Joachim Eckert, within the 90-day suspension period (which began on 8 October 2015) of the two football officials.\n\"The investigatory chamber also confirms the ongoing proceedings against suspended FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke related to the suspicion of misuse of expenses and other infringements of FIFA's rules and regulations.\n\"Formal investigation proceedings relating to the suspicion of infringements of the FIFA Code of Ethics are amongst others ongoing against Worawi Makudi, Jeffrey Webb, Ricardo Teixeira, Amos Adamu, Eugenio Figueredo and Nicolas Leoz.\"\nWednesday's announcements come following the decision to amend article 36 of FIFA's Code of Ethics.\n\"The chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, Dr Cornel Borbely, welcomes the approval by FIFA's Executive Committee of the new wording of article 36 of the FIFA Code of Ethics. In future, it will be possible for the Ethics Committee to confirm on request the opening of proceedings against representatives of world football,\" the statement read.\n\"The investigatory chamber will always weigh the interests of transparency against the need to conduct proper adjudicatory proceedings, the personality rights of the parties involved and the presumption of innocence.\n\"For procedural reasons, the investigatory chamber can therefore only comment on ongoing formal proceedings regarding members of the Executive Committee, the Secretary General, the candidates for the FIFA Presidency and confederation representatives in leading positions.\n\"If the investigatory chamber has information about a possible violation of the FIFA Code of Ethics, it will first analyse the relevant facts in a confidential preliminary investigation phase. In no circumstance will these preliminary inquiries be made public, due to procedural reasons.\n\"The chamber is currently carrying out a moderate number of preliminary investigations against a number of football officials. If one of these preliminary investigations gives rise to a concrete suspicion of wrongdoing, the chamber will open formal proceedings against the accused. Only then will the investigatory chamber consider whether to publicly confirm the relevant investigation.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:44:44.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
