Initially unaware of the extent of his injury, Difo left the game complaining of pain in his left hand. “The metacarpals are the long bones of the fingers, and can be fairly commonly injured in contact sports like baseball, where a player might slide into a base with impact to the hand, as in Wilmer Difo’s case,” said Dr. Michael Fitzmaurice, a prominent orthopedic hand surgeon and nerve injury expert in Phoenix, and founder of the only urgent care center for hand injuries in Arizona. Fractures to the metacarpals and phalanges (short bones in the fingers) can also result from a twisting or crushing injury.\nDue to his hand surgery and subsequent recovery, Difo is expected to miss the Arizona Fall League and Dominican Winter League in the upcoming offseason.\n“The length of the recovery period after surgery to fix a broken metacarpal will depend on the extent of the break, and the patient’s individual speed and rate of recovery,” added Dr. Fitzmaurice. “There is usually some form of physical therapy required to help restore flexibility and range of motion after the bone has been immobilized for the healing and recovery process.”\nFor Dr. Michael Fitzmaurice, this is an all-encompassing principle that guides everything he does in the office and in the operating room. It also is the guiding premise behind our unique level of compassion, commitment, and service. And it’s the very heart of his approach to your fastest, most complete relief and return to full function — the minimally invasive approach.\nDr. Michael Fitzmaurice is a board-certified surgeon with certification in both Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery. Dr. Fitzmaurice has performed thousands of surgical procedures with an endoscopic carpal tunnel success rate of greater than 99%. He specializes in minimally-invasive, endoscopic nerve procedures for carpal tunnel, trigger finger, tennis elbow and thumb arthritis. Dr. Fitzmaurice developed the patented EndoTech® surgical instrumentation system, and is one of the most sought after hand surgeons in the country.
