He lost possession to Yanic Wildschut, who raced down the right before crossing to Michael Jacobs, who scored from the edge of the penalty area.However, Bradford hit back 10 minutes later, Hanson equalising with a strong header from Tony McMahon's right-wing corner.Wigan's best effort in an evenly fought first half came in the 14th minute when Ben Williams was forced to make a diving save to deny Michael Jacobs after a surging run by the midfielder.At the other end, Hanson saw his goal-bound header headed behind by Chris McCann in the 21st minute and goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen did well to keep out McMahon's volley four minutes before Wigan went ahead.
