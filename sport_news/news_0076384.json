He isn't close to the offensive threat on the road that he is at home. \nBryant entered the National League Championship Series 0-for-11 on the road and promptly went 0-for-3 with a walk in Game 1. \nThis is a first-guess: I would've moved up Anthony Rizzo to third because I want him guaranteed an at-bat in the first inning of a road game, then bat Castro or Jorge Soler, and then Bryant fifth. \nWill it happen? Maddon's known for his creativity and flexibility. But he's also not exactly reactionary. \nMaddon may prefer to stick with his current lineup, which he'll also unveil at Wrigley Field, in an effort to help his young stars find and keep normalcy. After all, for most of them, this is the first time they've been to the playoffs, let alone an NLCS. \nPlayers are creatures of habit, especially young ones who are coping with this type of adversity for the first time. \nThen again, their trust in Maddon — and it's high — might overcome any kind skepticism of the moves he makes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:53:13.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
