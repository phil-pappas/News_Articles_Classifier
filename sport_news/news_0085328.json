The Texas Drowning Prevention Alliance (TXDPA) spells out the ABCs of water safety. These are a good reminder for everyone all year long.\nThe A in ABC is for Adult Supervision. This is the no. 1 rule of swimming – never ever swim alone. Adults should always watch their children in and around the pool. If you’re hosting a pool party with children present, make sure to hire a certified lifeguard. Tragedies often occur when a caretaker is at home and there is a lapse in supervision.\nB is for Barriers. All pools should have layers of protection installed, including property perimeter fences. These fences should be greater than 5 feet tall and non-climbable. Isolation fences must separate the pool or spa from the residents with openings of no more than 4 inches wide, so children can’t squeeze through the open spaces. Isolation fences must be non-climbable, four-sided, and a minimum of 48 inches high. A height of 60 inches is recommended.\nFor pool areas with gates, these gates must be kept closed and not propped open. Doors, windows, and gates must be locked and be self-closing and self-latching. Tables, chairs, and planters must be moved away from the pool. Floating toys, balls, floats, and sinking toys left in the pool are enticing.\nC is for Classes, including swim lessons and CPR. Enroll your children in proven swimming lessons until they have mastered the four competitive strokes, treading water, sidestroke, and floating. You can ask your friends for referrals. It’s important to learn CPR skills as these have saved lives and prevented brain damage. CPR is the first chance to keep someone alive before medical personnel can tend to an emergency. All caregivers should be required to become CPR-certified.\nD is for Devices, such as poles, ring buoys, rescue tubs, first aid kits, and a cellphone. You should always keep a cellphone with you by the pool. Also, a 911 emergency number, home phone number, and home address should always be posted by the pool. Purchase a lightning detector to help alert you when lightning is in the area. Vacate the water when lightning or other threatening weather looms.\nPool Guard fences comply with the isolation barrier fence recommendations made by the TXDPA. All Pool Guard fences are at least 4 feet tall and have a self-closing, self-latching key-lockable gate.
