The Draper-based school inherited large portions of the Hawks' enrollment, and the one-time Class 5A powerhouse suffered.\nAlta began the 2014 season with seven consecutive losses, while Corner Canyon reeled off 12 straight victories en route to the semifinals. Whispers circulated. Would Alta ever be the same? The offseason presented an entirely revamped coaching staff, new facilities to maintain pace in the arms race with Corner Canyon's cathedral and realignment into the 4A classification.\nAlta waited patiently for the opportunity to play the Chargers, and finally Friday night provided the chance for the Hawks to make the statement they'd been clamoring to announce: Their return to power is ahead of schedule.\n  With an array of weapons and a balanced attack offensively, Alta never trailed in its 45-31 win in the first-ever meeting between the newfound rivals. The Hawks wrapped up the No. 3 seed from Region 7 with the win, while Corner Canyon enters the postseason as the fourth seed.\n\"That's a great win for our kids,\" said first-year Alta coach Alema Te'o. \"That's a good [Corner Canyon] football team, and they fought back. They gave us everything we wanted. Our kids played our hearts out, and I'm proud of all of them.\"\nAlta exploded for a 21-3 lead in the first quarter after Braxton Kerr connected with Camden Johnsen for an 85-yard touchdown on the opening play from scrimmage\n\"We called it from the very beginning: We are going to score on the first play,\" Te'o said. \"We planned that throughout the week and we knew exactly what to do.\"\nKerr followed suit with scoring strikes to Josh Davis (24 yards) and another to Johnsen (31 yards). He finished with five touchdowns thanks to two second-half scoring connections with Zach Engstrom. The second furnished a 45-31 lead after Corner Canyon's Zach Wilson hit Nate Cutler for a 41-yard touchdown to pull within one score. \n\"I'll tell you what: He played a like a man tonight,\" Te'o said of Kerr. \"He did a great job.\"\nWilson, whose interception set up the third score for Alta, eventually settled down. In the hostile environment, trailing 21-3, he calmly led a response drive before orchestrating another scoring march that culminated with Josh Adams' 1-yard burst to cut the deficit to 21-17 with 10:28 remaining in the second quarter.\nCorner Canyon gambled with an onside kick, which it recovered, on the ensuing kickoff, but an inadvertent whistle worked to Alta's benefit. The Hawks corralled the re-kick, and Davis immediately scampered 73 yards around the edge to inflate the lead back to 28-17.\nUnsatisfied with its four-point lead with seconds remaining until intermission, Alta marched down the field, even calling a hook-and-lateral and Statue of Liberty on consecutive plays, to position Mitch Fisher's 20-yard field goal as time expired in the first half for a 31-24 lead.\ntphibbs@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @trevorphibbs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:28:48.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
