Johnson asked out of the USA's CONCACAF Cup playoff vs. Mexico in extra time but was not injured at the time and only concerned about picking up an injury, according to U.S. Soccer. Monchengladbach followed that with a statement of its own that he was undergoing treatment for a thigh injury and was a doubt for the weekend's match vs. Eintracht Frankfurt.\nAsked about that following the USA's 1-0 loss to Costa Rica , Klinsmann responded defiantly and put the ball in Johnson's court by saying: “If you want to test it out, then see if he’s playing on the weekend and you have the answer.”\nSchubert said that even though Johnson is likely able to play Saturday, he defended his decision making in the heat of the moment vs. Mexico.\n\"Fabian has a thigh problem, but I’m assuming that he will be available in Frankfurt,\" Schubert said Thursday . \"We won’t know that until tomorrow either though. I can vehemently deny everything that has been written and said about him recently. I know Fabian to be a top professional who has a great mindset when it comes to the team, his job and his health. When a player feels a tightening of their thigh in added time in a game and could then be on the verge of a more serious injury, I only think it’s the responsibility of the team and himself to have him subbed off in that situation.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/10/13/usa-costa-rica-friendly-jurgen-klinsmann", "http://www.si.com/", "http://www.borussia.de/english/team/news/borussia-news/news-detailansicht.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=15318&cHash=2167353441b50a9e6b5e9a48dc3b8aa8", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/10/12/jurgen-klinsmann-fabian-johnson-usa-costa-rica-friendly"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:57:10.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
