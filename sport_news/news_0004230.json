WELLSVILLE â€” Conditions were anything but ideal Tuesday night. The rain had already been falling throughout the day when Fillmore and Wellsville stepped on the field, and it did nothing but intensify over the next 80 minutes. By the second half the edges of the field were splashing water when players ran through, making moving the ball a difficult proposition. Add Mother Nature to the list of challengers that haven't been able to slow down the Lady Eagles this season. Fillmore scored three goals in the second half, improving to a perfect 10-0 with a 4-0 win over the host Lady Lions Tuesday night. Carmen Mancuso had two goals and an assist to lead the charge, keeping Fillmore undefeated in its first game on turf this fall. Fillmore led just 1-0 at the half as the Eagles battled the tough conditions, not to mention a Wellsville team hungry for its first win. \"You just have to find a way to fight through that,\" Fillmore head coach Jon Beardsley said of the conditions. \"You don't see standing water on turf too much, but I'm glad we were on turf because it would've been a mess if we weren't. \"Both teams had to battle through it, and Wellsville made it tough for us in the first half. It was back and forth. We didn't give up chances, but they weren't giving us a lot of quality chances. You've just got to stay with the game plan and not get frustrated.\" Mancuso got the Eagles on the board in the 16th minute of the first period, netting an assist from senior captain Meghan Hatch. That's where it stood until about 7:30 into the second period, when Mancuso set up Tess Schilke for her 20th goal of the season. Schilke was marked up well by Missy Graham all night but the junior managed to add another score to her season tally, which is tops in Allegany County and fifth in all of Section V. \"As soon as you get that second goal, it makes everything easier,\" Beardsley said. \"At 1-0 a team knows they can get a breakaway and anything can happen. Once you give up the second sometimes there's a letdown there. I was glad to get that second one when we did.\" Mancuso pushed the lead to 3-0 with 19:34 remaining. Macy Miller had the assist. Elsa Cole quickly tacked on another less than a minute later, netting a deep shot that was lofted in perfectly. Erin Lawson had eight saves for the Lions. Caylen Bedow picked up her fourth shutout for the Eagles, who have a 46-6 cumulative goal advantage through 10 games. \"We've had a little bit of a lull lately,\" Beardsley said. \"We had Homecoming, which is big even in itself. I don't know if we played real well that day. We've been dealing with a little sickness. I'm just hoping it's a little bit of a hump, but I'll take humps when you're winning 4-0, 4-1.\" Page 2 of 2 - Fillmore has a showdown with undefeated Whitesville (9-0) Thursday in the opening round of the Bolivar-Richburg Tournament at 5 p.m. \"I'm sure it will be a good one,\" Beardsley said. Wellsville (0-9-2) travels to Dansville Thursday. The Lions tied the Mustangs earlier this season.
