(Stew Milne / AP) Notre Dame hopes to delay Navy QB's rushing touchdown record. \nKeenan Reynolds has made a habit of finding his way to the end zone. \nThe Navy quarterback's 73 rushing touchdowns place him in a tie for second on the all-time FBS list. He's four away from matching the record held by Wisconsin's Montee Ball heading into Saturday's game against No. 15 Notre Dame. \n\"It's a reflection of my teammates and the guys around me,\" Reynolds said in a phone interview Wednesday. \"To be mentioned in the same categories as some of the greats to play college football is an awesome experience.\" \nNavy (4-0) is off to its best start since 2004, and Reynolds is a big reason as the focal point of the triple-option offense. He leads the Midshipmen with 488 rushing yards and nine touchdowns and has thrown for 265 yards and two scores. \n\"He always gets us in the right play,\" coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \"That's a comfort as a coach, knowing that your quarterback ... always gets the ball to the right person, makes sure you have the proper angles.\" \nThe Irish limited Georgia Tech, which also runs the triple option under Niumatalolo's mentor Paul Johnson, to 216 rushing yards in a 30-22 victory. \n\"Notre Dame tried a lot of different fronts against Georgia Tech and were successful,\" Niumatalolo said. \"Hopefully for us, we have a veteran quarterback that's seen it all so that we can get in the right plays if they try to shift around and do a bunch of different fronts.\" \nReynolds has plenty of experience against the Irish. He rushed for 53 yards and three touchdowns and threw for a score in Navy's 38-34 loss in 2013 at Notre Dame Stadium. Last year at FedEx Field in Landover, Md., he passed for 118 yards and two touchdowns in a 49-39 defeat. \n\"Can't say enough good things about (Reynolds),\" Irish linebacker Joe Schmidt said. \"He does a good job running their system. He's careful with the football. ... He's definitely done a lot of things right.\" \nReynolds has passed Heisman Trophy winners Ron Dayne (71) and Ricky Williams (72) this season on his way up the rushing touchdown list. He's tied with Travis Prentice of Miami of Ohio (1996-99) and already holds the FBS record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. \nBut he never has defeated Notre Dame. He relishes having another chance. \n\"One of the reasons I came to the Naval Academy to play football was because I get to play Notre Dame every year,\" said the native of Antioch, Tenn. \"Two times at Notre Dame Stadium, there's a lot of people in this world that can't say they've been able to do that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:25:12.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
