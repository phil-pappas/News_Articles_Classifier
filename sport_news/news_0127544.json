The Seahawks defeated the Cardinals 19-3. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll managed to find a silver lining amid the rubble of his team's fourth-quarter collapse in Sunday's 27-24 loss at the Cincinnati Bengals.\nAdChoices Carroll lauded the play of the Seahawks' offensive line, which has been under fire after quarterback Russell Wilson was sacked 18 times in the first four games.\n“Without question the offensive line of scrimmage was really the best it has been,” Carroll told reporters. “We came off the ball well, we ran the football the way we’d like to. ... It was the sharpest we’ve been.”\nAlthough Wilson was taken down four more times, he was not under pressure throughout - as was the case in the previous game versus Detroit. The line also paved the way for 200 yards rushing on 30 attempts, highlighted by 169 from rookie Thomas Rawls.\n“The tempo coming off the football was really good. We moved the line of scrimmage well,\" Carroll said. \"It really felt attitude-wise much more in line with what we have done in the past.”\nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
