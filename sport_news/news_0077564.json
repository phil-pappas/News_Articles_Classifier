(AP) - An advocate for the disabled is touring New York to draw attention to what he says is the state's failure to protect disabled individuals in state care.\nMichael Carey says the state doesn't properly investigate abuse and neglect in institutions and that an agency called the Justice Center created to review such incidents too often covers them up. He says cases of abuse should instead go to 911.\nCarey's 13-year-old son was killed in state care in 2007. Carey said he plans to visit law enforcement and elected leaders during his tour, which began Tuesday at the state Capitol.\nIn a statement, the Justice Center said every allegation of abuse or neglect is fully investigated and that 169 individuals have faced charges as a result of its work.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:53:19.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
