They landed their big target, Jurickson Profar, for a signing bonus of $1.5 million. Shortly thereafter, they spent the bulk of their remaining funds on a $1.2m bonus to lock down fellow middle infielder Luis Sardiñas. Both moves would pay off, Profar and Sardiñas both saw time in the big leagues relatively quickly; Profar in 2013, and Sardiñas the following year. \nBut when likely future Hall of Fame third baseman Adrian Beltre hobbled to first base like a broken toy soldier in game one of the ALDS on Thursday, neither Profar nor Sardiñas were anywhere to be found. Profar was rehabbing a bum shoulder in Arizona for the second consecutive fall, and Sardiñas' value for the series was of the \"Trade\" fashion, having been dealt to Milwaukee as part of a package for Game One starter Yovani Gallardo. \nGone, too, was Adam Rosales, Texas' de facto utility infielder for the last two years; DFA'd to make space on the roster for Derek Holland's return from the 60-day DL. \nJoey Gallo? Nope. Gallo's strikeout rate made him an untenable addition to the postseason roster (though shortly after Beltre's injury, he too would be Toronto-bound as a just-in-case option.) \nThere were three others on the Rangers bench with experience at third base, but Robinson Chirinos was the starting catcher, and Steve Buechele is 54 years old and the bench coach. So for now, the Rangers turned to another member of the 2009 International signing class: Hanser Alberto, whose $7,000 signing bonus wasn't even enough to buy a new car. \nWhen Alberto stepped on the field in Toronto, it marked his first time playing in the field in a game since September 7th, and in the first (September 27th against the A's) he had pinch-hit and played just one inning at his natural position of shortstop. Oh right, about that: when he was forced into the national spotlight Thursday afternoon, he was also playing out of position. In his six years in the minor leagues and his brief stint in the majors this year, he had played a total of just 36 games at third base, 17 of which were in A-ball in 2012. If that's not enough, the Rogers Centre's field is made of turf which makes fielding a treacherous proposition for even the most experienced fielders. No worries; Hanser Alberto had played on turf before: on June 26th of this year, he pinch hit for Beltre in a blowout and played one inning in Toronto. \nBut the Rangers had opted to keep the effervescent middle infielder by the nickname of \"radio\" (a reference to his tendency to call play-by-play for games he was playing [a habit he no doubt picked up from his father Tony, a sports broadcaster in Alberto's native Dominican Republic]) for a reason: he is kind of a defensive wizard. Upon advancing to AA Frisco at the age of 20 in 2013, Alberto had struggled at the plate, hitting just .213. After struggling again in the Dominican Winter league the following off-season, he was demoted to class-A Myrtle Beach to start the 2014 season. While he did eventually work his way back to Frisco, his bat was... just okay. The glove, however, was something special. Alberto was named the Rawlings Minor League Gold Glove Award winner at shortstop in 2014. \nBut something clicked in winter ball after the 2014 season, and in an admittedly small sample size of 90 ABs, Alberto hit .390 with an OPS of .945; higher than any level prior. At the beginning of this year, he was assigned to AAA Round Rock, and again hit over .300. With Rougned Odor sorting himself out in the minors and journeyman Tommy Field as the starting second baseman in Arlington, Alberto got the call. He made his major-league debut on May 29th and played 24 games, even getting off to a hot start that saw him collect hits in 7 of his first 8 games, hitting .344 in that stretch. But the big leagues caught up to him and by the time he was sent back to AAA, his batting average had regressed to .247. Rougned Odor was ready, and Alberto was back in AAA. \nBut as a September call-up, despite an understandable lack of playing time in a pennant race, Hanser provided something that you might only notice if you knew what you were looking for: Every time a runner scored, Alberto was on the top step, high-fiving, cup-checking, and generally being the kind of cheerleader that every team needs. Having played in the minor leagues with quite a few of the now-regulars, he was no stranger to the likes of Chirinos, Odor, or Chris Gimenez, and over half of the twelve people the Rangers trotted out to left field in 2015. \nSo when he misplayed two balls in game one, while the national media, with no background to draw from, began to make the assumption that Alberto was a vastly inferior defensive player, his teammates knew better. Where once he had been the cheerleader, now his teammates approached him between innings to pat his back, bump fists, and let him know that they knew: He was going to be just fine. \nHe made another error in game two, and it proved to be costly, allowing two runs to score. He got one back on a sac fly to score Odor, but when he stepped to the plate in the 14th inning, he was still, officially, 0-6 for the series. With Beltre having picked up a bat in the dugout, many thought this would be time to see if Adrian could get another good swing. Maybe he could have. \nBut thankfully, we'll never need to know. Hanser Joel Peña \"radio\" Alberto stepped to the plate… \n\" ...with a crowd of 50,000 at a fevered volume. The first pitch is swung on and just tipped… the count goes to 0-1. That was a 95-mph fastball, a little up in the zone, and he took a good hack, but just got under it… LaTroy Hawkins, the oldest player in Major League baseball is on the mound, and he peers in for the sign. Here's the 0-1 pitch, and he lines it into centerfield! Odor is running on the play, he's rounding third! Here's the throw from Pillar, and it's a good one! The play at the plate! Odor is… SAFE!! And the Rangers take a 5-4 lead in the top of the 14th inning in Toronto! \" \nIn between watching the playoffs through the cracks of your fingers while covering your eyes, you can follow Levi on Twitter @ThreeTwoEephus .
