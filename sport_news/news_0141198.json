But this time there was no drama as Seattle used a stifling defense and trademark running game to hold on and improve to 3-4 this season. Here are the early grades:\nOffense\nBack in his home Bay Area stomping grounds, Marshawn Lynch turned in a vintage performance -- upset stomach and all -- finishing with a season-high 122 yards on 27 carries.\nLynch set the tone with nine carries for 38 yards on Seattle's opening 61-yard touchdown drive as the Seahawks used as many I-formation and two-back looks as they have all season. They also had as run-heavy of a game plan as they have had all season with 41 rushes to 24 passes.\nThe running success helped set up some of the play-action passes that have long been a staple of a successful Seattle offense, notably a 43-yard touchdown pass from Russell Wilson to Tyler Lockett late in the second quarter that made it 17-0. Lockett had the best day of his younger career with five receptions for 79 yards.\nThe Seahawks showed a lot of variety on the opening drive, with Lynch picking up 17 yards out of a two-tight end I-formation set on one play and then getting 16 on a pass out of a five-wide-receiver formation on the next.\nWilson almost was flawless early, hitting on 10 of his first 13 passes for 184 yards.\nBut his 14th pass was picked off in the end zone late in the first half as the Seahawks seemed prepared to knock the 49ers out early. Wilson tried to hit Doug Baldwin on the play in the back of the end zone.\nWilson threw another interception in the third quarter when he let it fly roughly 60 yards deep to Jermaine Kearse, with Kenneth Acker picking it off at the 7-yard line.\nThat gave Wilson five interceptions for the season -- he had seven all of last year and nine in 2013.\nAs the Seahawks went with a run-heavy plan, receiving numbers weren't high. Tight end Jimmy Graham, though, made his one catch early count, a 23-yarder that set up a field goal that made it 10-0.\nInjuries forced the Seahawks to have to shuffle their line a few times, with Alvin Bailey stepping in at right tackle for Garry Gilliam in the second half -- Gilliam had been bothered by an ankle injury all week.\nThat contributed to what was again some shaky pass protection, and Wilson was sacked five times to bring Seattle's NFL-high sack total for the season to 31.\nDefense\nThe Seahawks forced the 49ers to punt on all five first-half possessions and held San Francisco to 55 yards on 21 plays -- the 49ers got no closer than the Seattle 36-yard line in the first half and crossed midfield just twice all game.\nThe 49ers finished with just 142 yards and punted on nine of 10 possessions.\nCliff Avril and Michael Bennett have played as well as any set of defensive ends all season, and if anything they played even better against the 49ers.\nThe two combined for four sacks in the first half -- Bennett with 2.5 and Avril 1.5 -- as the 49ers punted on all five of their first-half possessions.\nAvril then forced a fumble on San Francisco's first possession of the second half.\nBennett then forced a hold by Alex Boone early in the third quarter and added another sack a few minutes later.\nSeattle finished with a season-high six sacks, Bennett with 3.5 and Avril 1.5, the most since the Seahawks had six against the 49ers last December in Seattle.\nK.J. Wright, back at weakside linebacker, blew up a few screen plays early.\nAnd the secondary played to a Legion of Boom level throughout. Richard Sherman was particularly key as he shadowed Torrey Smith everywhere and shut him out, depriving 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick of his best big-play receiver.\nRookie Frank Clark had some of the best moments of his young career, playing 15 of a possible 26 snaps in the first half and making 1.5 tackles, including a 3-yard loss of Carlos Hyde.\nThe 49ers tried to duplicate the success other teams have had of using the tight end. But Vernon Davis was a non-factor until a 27-yard pass late in the third quarter that led to a field goal.\nSpecial teams\nIt seemed like Seattle escaped disaster a few times, with a punt almost blocked in the fourth quarter and the 49ers appearing close to breaking a couple of kickoff returns.\nUltimately, though, it was no harm, no foul.\nEarl Thomas had two tackles on kickoffs, one preventing a possible touchdown.\nSteven Hauschka hit two field-goal attempts and is 16 for 16 this season.\nThe Seahawks again had trouble shaking Lockett loose for much in returns, but on this night it didn't matter.\n(c)2015 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742084", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742084&h=Seahawks+dominate+49ers+in+20%2D3+victory", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742084&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:11:57.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
