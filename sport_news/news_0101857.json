Active as a solo cellist since he gave up the principal cello chair at the Seattle Symphony in 2008, Roman devotes the rest of his energies to composing works for his own use, as well as other musicians.\nAs a matter of fact, the two Joshua Romans will merge at this weekend's season-opening concerts of the south suburban Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra, at which the composer will perform the world premiere of his own cello concerto, \"Awakening,\" under the baton of music director David Danzmayr.\nThe 31-year-old Oklahoma City native, now a resident of New York City, regards the two sides of his artistic personality as complementary, one fueling the other — inseparable from the other activities by which he defines himself as a switched-on, tuned-in classical musician of the early 21st century.\nRoman's cello concerto — an IPO commission that's being shared with Danzmayr's other American orchestra, the ProMusica Chamber Orchestra in Columbus, Ohio — takes its title from an awakening from a failed relationship, he explains.\n\"While the music loosely evokes the love affair, it's also as much about realizing that sometimes you just have to let go and surrender to the flow of life,\" he says of the five short, interconnected sections that make up the concerto. \"The cello represents the protagonist. The orchestra sometimes represents the world as it is, sometimes the other person in the relationship: Love song, fight song, a song of despair and a moment of apotheosis.\"\nGifted young violinist the star of Semyon Bychkov's mostly Brahms program with CSO John von Rhein Semyon Bychkov has been appearing with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra fairly regularly since 1988 and during that time has proved himself one of the orchestra's most dependable guest conductors. Not always the most charismatic of podium guests, but unfailingly thorough in a way that calls attention...\nSemyon Bychkov has been appearing with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra fairly regularly since 1988 and during that time has proved himself one of the orchestra's most dependable guest conductors. Not always the most charismatic of podium guests, but unfailingly thorough in a way that calls attention...\n(John von Rhein) The score's melodic sensibility, the composer adds, reflects \"broad and evolving\" influences ranging from contemporary classical composition (both Mason Bates and Aaron Jay Kernis have written cello concertos for him) to his favorite alternative pop groups and composers, in this case the British indie rock band Alt-J and American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens.\nEska Koester, the Illinois Philharmonic's executive director, observes that the world premiere is \"an incredible opportunity for us,\" given that \"orchestras our size aren't typically able to commission a piece, especially by an artist of Joshua's caliber.\"\nAdds Danzmayr, who is launching his fourth and final season as IPO music director with these concerts in Frankfort and Joliet: \"This is something special for our audience, because often when the public hears a piece of contemporary music they can't connect it to a face or a personality. With Joshua playing his own work, the connection is immediately there.\"\nAlthough Roman has been playing the cello since age 3, he did not begin serious musical composition until about two years ago — inspired, he says, by the examples of composer-performer colleagues such as Derek Bermel, Gabriela Lena Frank and others whose music he programs as artistic director of TownMusic, an experimental chamber music series he runs in Seattle.\n\"They would play some of their own music and music that inspired them,\" explains Roman, who blogs regularly on the streaming channel Second Inversion on Seattle's KING-FM. \"Seeing them do that, and experiencing the gravitas it lent to their interpretations of a Brahms piano trio or a Bartok violin sonata, really inspired me.\"\nIn recent years he's composed for other performers as well as himself, including a chamber piece for the Verge Ensemble in Washington, D.C., and a song cycle that soprano Jessica Rivera will perform in Seattle in February. Next spring Roman will play the Mason Bates concerto as part of the cellist's residency with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.\nRoman has even become something of a classical celebrity on YouTube, where he has posted his performances of the complete cello etudes of David Popper — sort of the \"Well-Tempered Clavier\" of the solo cello repertory — as both a learning tool for cellists and a means of drawing them together as a global online community.\n\"For me that's very important for classical music in general,\" Roman says. The Internet, he adds, provides musicians with a ready means of \"reaching out to people and sharing\" on a scale far vaster than the \"Schubertiades\" and other forms of communal musicmaking and music-sharing in 18th and 19th century European salons.\nNot only that, Roman is presently producing a video series for YouTube he calls \"Everyday Bach\" — movements from the Bach cello suites performed by him in different outdoor and indoor spaces around the world. He's posted roughly a dozen such videos so far, from locations ranging from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, to a public square in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to the rooftop of his sister's apartment in New York City, with Freedom Tower gleaming in the background.\n\"I am curious to find out how (people's visual perceptions) affect how they hear a piece of music,\" Roman says of the video series. \"I tried to match each movement to the setting. Hopefully this beautiful, powerful music of Bach's can inspire an emotional response from viewers and even create an ongoing dialogue.\"\nJoshua Roman will play the world premiere of his cello concerto, \"Awakening,\" with conductor David Danzmayr and the Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra, at 8 p.m. Saturday in Lincoln-Way North Performing Arts Center, 19900 S. Harlem Ave., Frankfort; and 3 p.m. Sunday at Rialto Square Theatre, 102 N. Chicago St., Joliet; $25 and up; 708-481-7774, www.ipomusic.org .\n'Beyond the Aria'\nThe sold-out, season-opening recital of the Harris Theater's \"Beyond the Aria\" series, Monday night on the Pritzker Pavilion stage at Millennium Park, brought a number of surprises beyond the expected fine singing of soprano Amanda Majeski, bass-baritone Luca Pisaroni and Ryan Opera Center tenor Jonathan Johnson, in the cabaret-style setting.\nThe three singers were moonlighting from their roles in Lyric Opera's currently running production of Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and received dedicated support from pianist and series artistic director Craig Terry, of the Lyric and Ryan Center staff.\nWho knew, for example, that Majeski could tap dance so delightfully, in addition to delivering a meltingly lovely \"Song to the Moon\" (from Dvorak's \"Rusalka\")? Her more-than-fancy footwork brought down the house as she accompanied Johnson's rousing rendition of Frank Loesser's \"Dolores.\" And when gorgeously sung simplicity was in order, as in Ricky Ian Gordon's \"Red Dress\" and William Bolcom's \"Waitin',\" she delivered that too.\nWho knew that Pisaroni (who portrays Count Almaviva opposite Majeski's Countess in \"Figaro\") had a passionate flair for such classic American songs as Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\" and Gershwin's \"Embraceable You\"? His deep, caressing tone, idiomatic sense of style and deep feeling for the texts and music lifted four Italian songs by Tosti and Donaudy into the realm of high vocal art.\nJohnson's bright, technically secure lyric tenor traced an affecting emotional trajectory through seven of the 16 songs of Schumann's cycle \"Dichterliebe,\" in serviceable German. This young man is going places.\nThe series will continue with recitals by other Lyric Opera artists on Dec. 1, Jan. 15, March 14 and May 17; 312-334-7777, www.harristheaterchicago.org .\nSharps and flats\n— Both the Symphony of Oak Park and River Forest, and the Chicago Choral Artists, will celebrate anniversaries with the opening concerts of their 2015-16 seasons this weekend.\nJay Friedman will be honored on his 20th anniversary as Oak Park/River Forest music director at concerts taking place at 4 p.m. Sunday in Lund Auditorium, Dominican University, 7900 Division St., River Forest.
