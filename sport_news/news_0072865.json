The coach gathers up his players, gives away game balls, then throws in a few expletives and fist pumps. The emotion is raw, serious. \nInto this backdrop walks linebacker Von Miller. After the Broncos pulled off a breathtaking victory at Kansas City, he eschewed Rockne in favor of psychology. \n\"You have to have mind control,\" explained Miller, keeping a straight face. \"When I first said it I was being funny. But I have kept saying it after that game and at practice. Guys started believing. So how do we keep pulling this off? We've got mind control.\" \nSunday provided more Freud for thought as the Broncos twice squandered 10-point leads before securing a 23-20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, a lead preserved in the final seconds when safety T.J. Ward sacked Minnesota quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, forcing a fumble that Miller recovered. \nIt's becoming easier to appreciate the Broncos' 4-0 start than explain it. The Broncos blend dominance with clumsiness, brilliance with foolishness, but when the spotlight shines brightest they display eye-opening talent and uncommon resolve. They vanquished the Baltimore Ravens on Baltimore's last offensive play. They scored twice in nine seconds at Kansas City, a loss from which the Chiefs have yet to recover. They marched down the field late in the fourth quarter to snuff out the Detroit Lions. Advertisement \nSo perhaps it was no surprise an outcome that appeared decided after Ronnie Hillman's 72-yard scoring run in the second quarter and Owen Daniels' 1-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter hung in the balance with 1:51 remaining. These Broncos don't leave Thunder panting from sprints after touchdown drives. They leave games with dirt under their fingernails, scowls on their faces and hearts in their collective esophagus. \nA defense that suffocated Bridgewater early, but wobbled in the fourth quarter, required one last stand. The Broncos made an important adjustment, with defensive coordinator Wade Phillips returning to a front that created trouble in the first quarter. \nWard lined up on the left side over tight end Kyle Rudolph, feigning man-to-man coverage. He inched out before the snap, blitzing just as he did in the first quarter on the Broncos' first sack. It forced the Vikings to make a difficult decision on how to account for everyone. They tempered the effectiveness of DeMarcus Ware and Miller after halftime by going to a split back set and chip blocking them with tight ends. \n\"It was getting harder to get there,\" said Ware, who is the only player in the league with a sack in every game this season. \"We knew we had to change it up.\" \nWard took off with bad intentions, and right tackle T.J. Clemmings missed him, as did running back Adrian Peterson. Ward reached Bridgewater, who finished 27-of-41 for 269 yards, and stripped the ball loose. Miller pounced on it. Consider it Pepto-Bismol to the growing ulcers in the bellies of Broncos' fans. \n\"As a defense, we aren't losing a game put on our shoulders,\" defensive end Malik Jackson said. \"We are built to finish.\" \nDrama appeared ready to become a stranger in the second quarter. Hillman took a toss sweep, and raced down the left sideline into the end zone to revive a doormat running attack. Hillman's 72-yard run represented more yards than the Broncos rushed for in any of the three previous games. \n\"That was the spark. We need to just keep punching the card,\" said Hillman, who finished with 103 yards on 11 carries while sharing time with C.J. Anderson. \"We never let up. To pull this off, you have to have a huge set of. ...\" \nLet's say guts for the kids. The Broncos grabbed a 10-0 lead then showed similar boldness on fourth-and-goal at the 1 in the third quarter. If running backs have to make tacklers miss it follows that coaches have to make defenders guess. The Broncos began their formation with reserve center James Ferentz at fullback. He jogged forward, flanking left tackle Ryan Harris. Max Garcia flanked right tackle Michael Schofield, who performed well in his first NFL start. \nThe set howled power run. Instead, the Broncos tickled with a feather. Daniels lined up on the right side behind the tackles, and darted across the line at the snap. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, who completed 17 passes for 213 yards, but kept the Vikings close with two interceptions, faked the run and lobbed the ball to an uncovered Daniels in the end zone, pushing the Broncos ahead 20-10. \n\"A great call by the coaches. I think the defense was fooled,\" Daniels said. \"I kind of tried to stay hidden and get as low as I could.\" \nTied at 20 after Peterson's 48-yard touchdown run on fourth-and-1 and a Blair Walsh field goal — \"We just needed to make one more play,\" Peterson said — the Broncos mocked pressure. They marched 50 yards for the game-winning score, with Manning rebounding from interceptions to ignite the drive with a 17-yard strike to Emmanuel Sanders. Brandon McManus, 9-for-9 on field-goal attempts this season, drilled a 39-yarder for a 23-20 lead. \nThe game rested in the defense's hands. Bridgewater had the Vikings on the move. Yet no Broncos' player felt they were going to lose. \n\"Not one person. That's what coach Kubiak spoke about with the team afterward, about how he loves how we always believe,\" defensive end Antonio Smith said. \"Call it what you want. Von calls it mind control. The other team thinks they are going to win, but we have mind control over them.\" \nTroy E. Renck: trenck@denverpost.com or @troyrenck Seventh heaven \nThe Broncos' defense harassed Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater all day Sunday, sacking him seven times in the following fashion: \n• Safety T. J. Ward brought the heat from the outside with a blitz that landed Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater on the ground. \n• Outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware acted as a middle linebacker and blitzed right up the middle. \n• Outside linebacker Shane Ray made his first career sack beating his man with a smooth swim move. \n• Nose tackle Sylvester Williams and defensive end Malik Jackson smothered Bridgewater for a shared sack. \n• Inside linebacker Todd Davis hawked a scrambling Bridgewater to take him down. \n• Outside linebacker Von Miller joins the party by setting up his man with a finesse speed rush. \n• The game ends as it began. Another outside blitz from Ward leads to a strip sack that ends the Vikings' comeback efforts. Miller recovered the fumble. \n— Cameron Wolfe, The Denver Post The quarters FIRST QUARTER \nDenver's defense continued to leave carnage in its wake. It blanked the Vikings, with T.J. Ward, DeMarcus Ware and Shane Ray making sacks. The Broncos' first drive stalled after 48 yards, resulting in a 33-yard field goal. SECOND QUARTER \nRonnie Hillman turned the corner and ran for more yards in one play — 72 — than the Broncos had rushing in any game this season. A Peyton Manning interception spoiled the quarter as Teddy Bridgewater threw a late TD. THIRD QUARTER \nThe Broncos showed they weren't averse to risk, scoring on fourth-and-goal from the 1. Manning found Owen Daniels crossing the formation for a wide-open touchdown. The defense continued to suffocate Adrian Peterson. FOURTH QUARTER \nOn the seventh sack, the Broncos finally rested. After squandering a 10-point lead, the Broncos moved ahead with Brandon McManus' 39-yard field goal and snuffed out the Vikings' final possession with T.J. Ward's second sack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:11:44.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
