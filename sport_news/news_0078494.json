But Klaus Stoehlker, a close associate of Blatter, told The Associated Press on Friday that the Swiss official is aiming to be back at work very soon.\n\"He has made an appeal and everybody hopes there will be a decision in the next 10 days,\" Stoehlker said. \"He is very, very tough ... he is sure he will have the right to be back. He doesn’t feel he is out of the job. That’s a huge misunderstanding.\"\nBlatter and UEFA president Michel Platini were given 90-day bans in the wake of a Swiss criminal case investigating financial misconduct at FIFA.\nBlatter has lodged an appeal, his lawyers said Friday, and has asked for the ethics committee to release the reasons for the suspension.\nMeanwhile, the home page of UEFA’s corporate website still had a smiling photo and statement from Platini, the man they continue to call president.\n\"This is because the UEFA executive committee is aware that the UEFA president will immediately take all necessary steps to appeal the decision of the FIFA ethics committee to clear his name,\" European soccer’s governing body said in a statement.\nEven if Blatter’s appeal fails, he could be back to work before the emergency presidential election scheduled for Feb. 26. Platini, however, would likely be forced out of the running to succeed Blatter if his expected appeal fails.\nIn a separate FIFA corruption case, Switzerland’s justice ministry granted an American request to extradite Costas Takkas, a former assistant to CONCACAF president Jeffrey Webb and the former general secretary of the Cayman Islands Football Association.\nTakkas, accused of accepting bribes, was among the seven officials arrested May 27 in Zurich.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:47.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
