They reload. \nSo it is with the Stevens football program. The Falcons lost 39 seniors to graduation, returning only five starters from a team that finished 8-4 and reached the second round of the playoffs. \nPicked to finish fifth in highly competitive District 27-6A this season, Stevens is on pace to have another good year. The Falcons are 5-1 overall and 1-0 in 27-6A’s Zone B heading into a zone game against Taft on Thursday night at Gustafson Stadium. \nStevens is No. 8 in the KENS 5 Class 6A area rankings. \n“Our kids have reached expectations that I thought couldn’t be reached this early because we’re so extremely young this year,” Stevens coach Darryl Hemphill said Tuesday. “But they’re playing well. They’re a great group of kids. They’ve got great leadership.” \nThe Falcons, who had a bye last week, opened zone play with a 51-0 rout of Jay on Oct. 3. Stevens began the season with a 30-26 win over Wagner and edged 5A power Boerne Champion 36-33 the following week. Then came a 56-21 loss to Clemens, which plays in the same 6A district with Steele, Judson and Smithson Valley. \nUndaunted, the Falcons bounced back from the lopsided defeat with victories against Roosevelt (44-20) and Clark (41-3) before they dismantled Jay. \nStevens junior quarterback Bryce Rivers, looking for a receiver in last month's game against Roosevelt, has thrown for 1,800 yards and 17 TDs this season. (Photo: Miguel Esparza / Special to Kens5.com) \nAny discussion about the Stevens offense begins and ends with junior quarterback Bryce Rivers, one of the best play-makers in the San Antonio area. Although Rivers has been intercepted nine times, he has balanced the books by passing for 1,800 yards and 17 touchdowns. \n“Bryce Rivers is the best throwing quarterback that we’ve ever had here,” Hemphill said. \nHemphill would know. He was on the Falcons’ first coaching staff when Stevens opened in 2005, and served as defensive coordinator under Lee Bridges for seven years before succeeding him as head coach in 2013. \nSo what makes Rivers such a potent offensive threat? \n“He just finds his targets and gets the ball there,” Hemphill said. “When Bryce came to us, he was already throwing the ball accurately and knew how to play the quarterback position. He’s also a natural leader. Kids follow him.” \nRivers is surrounded by one of the deepest and talented groups of receivers in the area. Junior Logan Mann played Pop Warner ball with Rivers and leads the Falcons with 31 catches for 776 yards and 10 TDs. \n“We have three or four other guys that make it hard for anybody to double Logan,” Hemphill said. “He’s just really risen above everybody else as far as catching the ball. He’s 6-2½ with arms like Spiderman. He goes up and gets the ball and has very deceptive speed. He’s really very hard to cover.” \nStevens senior offensive tackle Trechun Oliver, left, blocks a Roosevelt lineman in the Falcons' 44-20 win last month.

He has 28 catches for 300 yards and three TD despite having played in only four complete games since he was injured on the first play in the game against Clark. Hemphill said Ortiz is also expected to miss Thursday night’s game. \n“Everybody was doubling Xavier and leaving Logan one-on-one, so he (Logan) took advantage of that,” Hemphill said. \nJunior Devin Martin (27-386-2), junior Tarin Dominguez (10-154-2) and senior Terrell Ramsey round out the rotation of receivers. \n“They’ve all caught passes,” Hemphill said. “We’ve been blessed with a great group of receivers. Xavier is out right now, but he’s our best receiver. He’s got the experience and has the best hands. He’s a very clutch guy. With him being out, people have started doubling Logan.” \nNo offense can move the ball consistently without good linemen and the Falcons have two solid guys up front in junior guard Steven Aguiano and senior tackle Trechun Oliver (6-4, 275). \n“We have counted on Trechun all year,” Hemphill said. “He’s a team captain and always grades out well. Steven Aguiano has done a great job for us as well.” \nThe defense is anchored by senior end Elijah Earls and senior Elijah Garcia. \nKENS 5 Class 6A Area Rankings \n1.
