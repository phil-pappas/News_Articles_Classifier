It's not too late to sign up, as you could win a $30 Wells Fargo Visa gift card or a 4K TV courtesy of RC Willey. \nThe rules are simple: guess the score for five games — each of the local FBS teams as well as some national games. The closer you get to the actual score and if you pick the correct team to win, the more points you get. If at the end of the week you end up with the most points, you'll walk away with a $30 Wells Fargo Visa gift card. \nTo sweeten the deal, RC Willey is giving away a 4K TV, a perfect addition to your man cave or TV room. To win, we'll take your highest seven weeks and compare them across the board, and whoever ends up with the highest total will win. \nRemember, Bowl games are worth double points, as well as games that feature two in-state teams (Utah State vs. BYU in Week 13). \nTo play KSL College Football Pick'em, click HERE or download the KSL GameCenter app on iOS or Android devices. \nHere's the list of games on the schedule this week: BYU (4-2) vs. Cincinnati (3-2); Utah State (3-2) vs. No. 21 Boise State (5-1); No. 6 LSU (5-0) vs. No. 8 Florida (6-0); No. 14 Notre Dame (5-1) vs. USC (3-2); and No. 4 Utah (5-0) vs. Arizona State (4-2). \nNow, on to the staff picks for Week 7.
