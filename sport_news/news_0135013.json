Crying Mets fan invited to playoff... \nChicago won its second straight to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series. The Cubs, who beat the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL wild-card game last week, would clinch a berth in the NL Championship Series with a Tuesday victory at Wrigley Field. \nSecond baseman Starlin Castro, first baseman Anthony Rizzo, right fielder Jorge Soler and center fielder Dexter Fowler also went deep for Chicago. \nBryant delivered the key blow -- a two-run homer in a three-run fifth that gave the Cubs a 4-2 lead. Rizzo followed with a solo shot to make it 5-2 in front of an announced crowd of 42,411.Cubs right-hander Jake Arrieta improved to 2-0 in the postseason despite allowing four runs in 5 2/3 innings. Cardinals right-hander Michael Wacha took the loss after giving up four runs in 4 1/3 innings. \nSt. Louis trimmed a 5-2 deficit to a single run in the sixth with right fielder Jason Heyward's two-run home run to left off Arrieta that scored left fielder Matt Holliday. \nArrieta departed after hitting pinch hitter Brandon Moss with a pitch. It was the Chicago ace's shortest since he allowed four runs in five innings in a May 16 loss to the Cleveland Indians. On Monday, Arrieta gave up five hits while walking two and striking out nine. \nSoler got the runs right back in the bottom of the sixth. His first-pitch homer to left scored pinch hitter Chris Coghlan and gave the Cubs a 7-4 lead. \nFowler added a one-out solo shot in the eighth off right-hander Jonathan Broxton. \nCardinals first baseman Stephen Piscotty's two-run, ninth-inning homer with two outs cut the Cubs' lead to 8-6.The six homers -- by six different players -- broke the Cubs' postseason record. They hit five against the San Diego Padres in a game in the 1984 NLCS. \nSchwarber's one-out solo homer in the second inning opened a 1-0 Cubs lead. Schwarber, who sat out Game 2 in St. Louis, sent Wacha's 2-2 pitch to the left field bleachers for his second homer of the postseason and 18th overall. \nThe Cardinals jumped in front 2-1 in the fourth. Arrieta opened the inning with walks to Piscotty and Holliday. Shortstop Jhonny Peralta doubled home Piscotty, and center fielder Tommy Pham brought in Holliday on a fielder's choice to third. \nIn the bottom of the fourth, Castro forced a 2-2 tie with a first-pitch solo homer that went 413 feet to the left field bleachers. \nLater in the inning, shortstop Addison Russell tripled to deep left with two outs but departed the game with a left hamstring strain. Javier Baez, who entered as a pinch runner for Russell, remained in the game at shortstop. \nBryant made it 4-2 in the fifth, connecting on Wacha's 3-2 pitch for a two-run homer to left. The homer -- his first of the postseason -- brought home right fielder Jorge Soler and earned a curtain call from Cubs fans. \nThat was it for Wacha, pulled for left-hander Kevin Siegrist. Wacha, who allowed three homers, walked three and struck out five. \nRizzo greeted Siegrist with a solo home run to right, his first of the playoffs, for a 5-2 Chicago lead. \nNOTES: The Cardinals entered Monday's NLDS game with an 11-8 regular-season edge over the Cubs but only four wins in nine games at Wrigley Field. The series is the first-ever postseason meeting between the teams. ... St. Louis C Yadier Molina is appearing in his ninth postseason (2004-06, 2009, 2011-15) and is the Cardinals' all-time postseason leader in hits, games played and at-bats. ... Cardinals manager Mike Matheny wasn't sure about Tuesday's starter after originally designating RHP Lance Lynn (12-11, 3.03 ERA) to go. On Monday, he said the Game 4 starter was still to be determined. ... The Cubs will send RHP Jason Hammel (10-7, 3.74 ERA) to the mound for Game 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:16:55.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
