A lot of the experiences she gets from club helps her grow every year. I foresee her being a First-Team player all four years of high school and playing in college also.”Blackley said being a member of a college volleyball team is definitely a goal and she has already received letters from a few programs.“I try to get the best out of everyone and get them to play at their highest potential,” said Blackley, who described herself as energetic. “I’m always really happy. I never get mad and I’m typically very cheerful.”As far as Alexander, the Lady Cougars are 22-9-1 at press time after earning a tough 9-21 record last season.“I think our coaching has really gotten better and we have been playing as a team,” Blackley said. “We’ve really worked together on calling for the ball and helping each other out.”Alexander concludes its regular season at Rockmart on Thursday and begins competition in the Area 5- tournament Oct. 10.“I really hope we can make it to state and get past the first round,” Blackley said.
