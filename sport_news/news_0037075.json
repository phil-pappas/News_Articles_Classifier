We are still a little rusty in terms of match play, so as a team goal, I think everyone needs to improve their mental stamina in terms of staying tough and focused throughout a full match and tournament weekend.” \nCompeting for the Wildcats this weekend will be Iva Bago, Livia Cirnu, Maria Panaite, Millie Stretton, Riley Nizzi and Carolina Costamagna. Both Panaite and Stretton, in her first collegiate action, earned a pair of wins during the OU Invite. \nWhile it has been a couple weeks since their last competition, Steinberg has emphasized a few points for the Wildcats entering the weekend. \n“Mental awareness of where we are in the match, the pace we play at, our focus level — those are all things we’ve been working on in practice,” Steinberg said. “This upcoming tournament is a great opportunity to implement these tools.” \nSteinberg will also utilize this tournament to find doubles combinations that work well together. Bago and Costamagna is one combination she may have already found after they went 3-1 at the OU Invite. \n“Iva and Caro did really well at the OU Invite,” Steinberg said. “We are mostly happy with their high-energy level together. Now that we know that these two can work well together, we are probably going to mix up the pairing this weekend.” \nAlso competing in the SMU Fall Invite will be SMU, Arkansas, Rice, TCU, UTEP, Louisiana Tech, Northwestern State, Abilene Christian, UTA and Midwestern State. \nFollowing play in Dallas, the Wildcats will send Bago, Costamagna, Sara Castellano and Ana Garcia Navas to the ITA Regional Championships in Stillwater, Okla., at Greenwood Tennis Center Oct. 15-18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:16:09.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
