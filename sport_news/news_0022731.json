Following the game, head coach Art Briles was asked about the injury and he said he was unsure if Russell would be healthy enough to play in the Bears’ next game on November 5 against Kansas State .\nAdChoices After Briles’ interview, Russell was sent for an x-ray and CT scan, and the results weren’t good.\nUpdate on Baylor QB Seth Russell: X-rays and a CT scan revealed a fracture in one of the bones of his neck. Will see a specialist next week.\n— Chuck Carlton (@ChuckCarltonDMN) October 24, 2015\nAssuming Russell’s injury won’t be a day-to-day type thing, the Bears will have to turn to freshman Jarrett Stidham to keep the team in the College Football Playoff race. While Stidham has shown the ability to perform in garbage time this season, it will be a lot different when he’s relied on to be the guy for a potential extended period of time.\nThe injury is devastating for Baylor, as this was the year it finally looked like Briles’ team was primed to break through. It’s even more frustrating for Russell, though, who finally got his chance this season after sitting behind Bryce Petty. Russell has 2,194 yards 29 touchdowns and five interceptions to this point in 2015. For this college football fan, I hope it’s not the last we’ve seen of Russell this year.\nJason Fletcher is a Senior Writer for RantSports.com .
