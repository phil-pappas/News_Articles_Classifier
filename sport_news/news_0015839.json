Green, 81, lovingly refers to the area as his “heaven in the hills.” However, he’s never had to share it with as many people as the past couple summers. “The Fourth of July is still the busiest weekend,” he said, “but it doesn’t have to be the weekends anymore.” Ironically, the four-year drought has made Pinecrest more popular than ever. While other area reservoirs are at historic lows, the man-made lake off Highway 108 remains full between Memorial Day and Labor Day because of state and federal regulations. The huge crowds have made parking and traffic a nightmare for cabin owners like Green. “We love the place, but it has growing problems,” he said. Green, a retired engineer, co-founded the group Friends of Pinecrest about eight years ago to advocate for the 383 U.S. Forest Service permittees with cabins around the lake. Some 14,000 “recreational residences” exist on national forest land throughout the United States. The permittees pay thousands in annual fees and taxes to use their exclusive cabins. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. holds pre-1914 rights to store 18,000 acre-feet of South Fork Stanislaus River water in Pinecrest, which it uses to generate hydroelectricity and provide Tuolumne Utilities District drinking water for roughly 44,000 county residents. During the federal relicensing process in 2008 for PG&E to continue operating its hydroelectric project, Friends of Pinecrest was a key player in pushing for the requirement to maintain the reservoir’s water level at or above 5,608 feet elevation from Memorial Day through Labor Day. The requirement was intended to preserve recreational opportunities throughout the summer, Green said, because PG&E often used to draw down the lake too low before Labor Day. An unintended consequence has been the recent spike in popularity for the reservoir during the drought. Green said his neighbor recently complained to the California Environmental Protection Agency about the exhaust fumes from all of the cars that line up on the road outside of his cabin while looking for a parking spot. “We’re basically at the limit of how many people we can satisfy,” Green said. “I don’t know the solution for it.” Stanislaus National Forest Summit District Ranger Molly Fuller hopes a parking, circulation and traffic plan put together by PG&E — another part of its 2008 relicensing requirements — will help. The plan is to address longstanding parking and traffic issues that have created concerns over emergency vehicle access during peak times. Fuller said many visitors who have trouble finding a parking spot will park illegally along roads or in other non-designated parking areas. People staying at the nearby campgrounds also park in the day-use area parking lots overnight. “It’s amazing what people will do to park,” she said. Fuller has worked on the plan with a committee comprised of local stakeholders, including Tuolumne County, the Pinecrest Permittees Association, Friends of Pinecrest as well as commercial permittees Dodge Ridge Ski Area and Pinecrest Lake Resort. Aspects of the plan include restriping to clearly delineate existing parking spots, creating designated drop-off and pick-up zones and issuing parking passes for permittees to park in any of the day-use area lots. “The philosophy behind the plan is to make all of the parking legal and enforceable,” Fuller said. “That should pretty much impact everyone equally, so on big weekends it won’t be a big free-for-all.” Construction is slated to begin after Labor Day 2016. Green has floated the idea of establishing an entrance fee, but the idea has gained little traction. Fuller acknowledged the concerns about overcrowding but said she hopes the parking and traffic improvements — as well as an end to the drought — will solve the issues without resorting to charging fees. “A lot of people want us to go straight to collecting fees to solve this problem, and I could see why,” she said. “You only want to do that as a fall back if nothing else works... If your car doesn’t start, you don’t immediately pull the engine.” Steve Krider, 63, of Alamo, was fly fishing off the shore at the reservoir Thursday. He said it has been years since he last tried to fish there during the summer because of the large crowds, instead opting to fish off the banks of the South Fork Stanislaus River. Krider said he wouldn’t mind paying an entrance fee as long as the money was being put to good use. However, some businesses at the reservoir are benefitting from the increased visitors. Robin Grove has been a seasonal employee at Pinecrest Food Market for 17 years and has seen a noticeable increase in people in the past two summers. “There’s been quite a few days where they actually park out on the highway and along the sides of the roads,” she said. Grove said employees who work later shifts often have trouble finding a spot as well. Despite the hassle, Grove said she believes an entrance fee would cause more problems than it would solve. She also said it would deter families with lower incomes from coming. “Pinecrest is the one place that lower-income families can come and enjoy themselves,” she said. “I think an entrance fee would really hurt. It would cut off some people who are just trying to get away with their family and small children.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:22:59.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
