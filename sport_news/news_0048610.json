Slaughter was joined by a host of his teammates as Scotland County’s offense proved to be too much for Schuyler County to handle as the Tigers rolled to a 34-16 victory over the Rams. While the win went a long way towards helping Scotland County in the district standings, the win meant more to the team than just the district seedings. “This win is big for us. It’s where we set our goals at the start of the season. We wanted to have a winning season and tonight gives us our five wins for the season and we also wanted to host a home playoff game,” Scotland County coach Mikel Gragg said. “By winning tonight, we kind of secured our place in the district and get to host a playoff game.” Slaughter took the opening kickoff nearly all the way for a score but had to settle for just a 45-yard return. All season long, Slaughter has been a dangerous return man, averaging nearly 30 yards a return, but tonight he got in on other aspects of the game. “He makes plays on special teams. He gets our offense in good starting position most of the time. That kid is electric and on offense, just to get the ball in his hands and stretch the field, is great,” Gragg said. Slaughter would total 122 yards of offense on only four touches and a receiving touchdown against Schuyler County. Another dimension to the game was shifting Aaron Buford back to quarterback after Will Fromm went down with a season-ending shoulder injury last week. “Aaron is a great athlete who sees the field really well and that’s kind of why we moved him to tailback to have him be able to see the field from there,” Gragg said. “With him at quarterback, it’s a wide open ball game.” Buford threw the ball for 182 yards and three scores, while he ran the ball 14 times for 58 yards. Schuyler County had its opportunities to score, getting inside the red zone four times, but turned the ball over twice. “They could have scored twice in the red zone. They should have scored twice but our defense had some resolve. They saw the ball come away from his body and managed to get two big turnovers,” Gragg said. For the Rams, they were playing without five of their usual starters. “You don’t want to blame it on this but we had five starters go out to injuries. We didn’t have our normal guys out there, so we had to do some different stuff but needless to say, Scotland did a great job. Their defense played well and they made the plays when they needed to,” Schuyler County coach Nick Wooldrick said. Page 2 of 2 - While the Rams did have key turnovers in the red zone, they did move the ball on Scotland County. Sabastian Grant totaled 177 yards on 36 carries and a score, while Riley Veatch went 7-for-12 passing for 78 yards and a score. With the loss, Schuyler County will drop in the district standings but Wooldrick still saw some positives out of his team. “The biggest thing is that the kids still fought. We were down a few guys but we still fought. We punched one in late there and I was proud of that. We’ve got to take some of the positives from tonight into next week,” Wooldrick said. “We’ve just got to capitalize when we get inside the red zone. If we can do that I think we’ll play a lot better next week.” With the victory, Scotland County is guaranteed a home playoff game against, potentially, Milan, but Gragg admits that this is when the season gets started for them. “We met our team goals we set at the beginning of the season but now it’s time to get going,” Gragg said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:21:58.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
