If Johnny Jones can’t do something with this group of players, then he will never do it.. anyways, go cats.

It’s not surprising. The only reason Skal and Simmons are 1st team is because of their recruit ranking and NBA draft hype (#1-2). Newman was also regarded as the best scorer in the class and might account for 60% of MSU’s offense. I doubt Charles Mann and Tim Quarterman are above Murray at the end of the year.

Wow. 8 god October 21, 2015 at 11:12 am | Permalink | Reply \nIs Skal going to be eligible or not? We have real basketball games soon.
