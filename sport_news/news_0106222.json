Heights hosts Granville at 7 p.m. Friday and then visits Licking Valley in Week 10. \nThe Blue Aces and Panthers each have had up-and-down seasons, but Heights expects neither opponent to be a breeze. The Hornets and Blue Aces have split victories in two nailbiters, and the Hornets have yet to conquer the Panthers. \n\"The season is shaping up the way we had hoped it would,\" coach Darren Waters said. \"We understand going down the stretch that every week the competition gets better. That's one of the things we talked a couple years ago about going into the LCL and the quality of opponent we have week in and week out doing a better job of preparing us for when we have a group of kids good enough to get us into the postseason.\" \nIf Valley loses to Watkins Memorial on Thursday, Heights will have a chance to earn a piece of the LCL-Buckeye title with a win on Friday. A victory also would put the Hornets in a good position to earn a postseason spot and keep them in contention for a home game in Week 11. \nGranville is struggling, having lost lopsided games to Licking Valley and Watkins Memorial the past two weeks. The Blue Aces, however, have an infusion of young talent with freshmen Cameron Crouch at quarterback and Brandon Haley at running back. \nSenior Thaddeus Winston is used sparingly in the backfield, but he scored two touchdowns against Watkins. The Blue Aces played a spirited first half against the Warriors, and if the Hornets start out slow as they have on several occasions this season, they could be in for a battle. \n“We are trying to play our best football,” Waters said. “We think if you can play your best football on a consistent basis, as you find yourself in tough situations, when you find yourself with your back against the wall, when you find yourself that you have to make a play, if you focus on your technique and fundamentals, those are the things that will pull you through those tough times.” \nHeights continues to click on all cylinders. Against overmatched Lakewood, the Hornets went to the air, and quarterback Gabe Caldwell re-wrote the record books, throwing for 388 yards and six touchdowns. The Hornets continued to hit their backs in space and let them make big plays, but Caldwell also showed the ability to throw to the outside to big targets Brandon Smith and Iman Ragland. \nCaldwell threw a touchdown each to Smith and Ragland, and for Smith, it was his second score in three weeks. \n“We have so many weapons on offense to run the ball around, and our defense is just so strong right now,” said senior linebacker Malicoate, who also rotates in at fullback when the offense goes to its stack-I formation. \n“The scary part is we can get better than we are right now if we keep working to reach the potential that I think we can later in the season.” \nksnyder@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:38:09.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
