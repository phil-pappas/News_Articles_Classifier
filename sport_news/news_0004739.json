The basketball game will be at noon, the hockey game at 7 p.m. Jan. 30.\nAnd the Wolverines do not have to surrender home dates.\nBut there's one minor challenge: Michigan fans will have to wait to get a crack at the tickets.\nPenn State announced today that its season-ticket holders will get the first chance to purchase tickets in a private presale Monday. The general public gets accesss at 10 a.m. Wednesday. The phone number is: 800-NITTANY.\nAccording to the release, \"ticket prices range from $65-$500 and include entrance for both games.\" The event is not currently listed for purchase on the Madison Square Garden website.\nThis will be the first \"Super Saturday\" in a series of basketball/hockey doubleheaders for Big Ten schools -- once each year at the Garden through 2019. It's part of the buildup to the 2018 Big Ten basketball tournament at the venue.\nJoin #PSUMBB & @PennStateMHKY in the B1Güçé.
