This forced Hearts to name an assistant coach in Yaw Preko - leaving the head coach role still vacant. \nOpare Addo, head of the team’s communications department says they will not advertise the coaching job but will go ahead and appoint a coach. \n“From this period we are head hunting, we want a head coach that can transfer whatever knowledge he has in the game to our players,” he told Joy Sports . \n“We are also looking for a young and energetic coach who will be able to do a lot for our squad, Hearts must be transformed and we must play an attractive football in our local league. \n“We must be able to get back into the Champions League so we need so we need a coach that has a lot of experience.” \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
