From the Meadowlands Matters blog on NorthJersey.com \nAs the Mets-Cubs National League Championship Series shifts to Chicago beginning on Tuesday, here is a tale about two Cubs-related songs that were written by the same songwriter — and the profoundly bittersweet story behind it all.\nThe first song you may have noticed already, if you caught the end of any Cubs games this year: “Go Cubs Go” is played after each Cubs win at Wrigley Field.\nThis infectious classic was written and recorded in early 1984 by local product Steve Goodman, who before that was best-known for writing the evocative train song “City of New Orleans” for Arlo Guthrie.\n“Go Cubs Go” captured the spirit of Chicago so well that it was an anthem for that 1984 season — which remarkably produced the Cubs’ first postseason appearance since 1945.\nThat song, legend has it, was in response to Cubs general manager Dallas Green (who later managed the Mets and Yankees) griping about a previous popular Goodman song that he considered too negative.\nThe response — a third Goodman classic — was a humorous dig at the plight of Cubs supporters called “A Dying Cubs Fan’s Last Request.”\nThat tune, first recorded just beyond Wrigley’s left field fence in 1983, has Goodman wryly asking in the refrain:\n“Do they still play the blues in Chicago\nWhen baseball season rolls around?\nWhen the snow melts away,\nDo the Cubbies still play\nIn their ivy-covered burial ground?” \nIt’s a brilliant six-minute song that has Goodman lamenting how each spring the Cubs would “raise up a young boy’s hopes, and then just crush ‘em — like so many paper beer cups.”\nSo this doomed character in the song imagines a perfect Cubs-centric funeral, with instructions that include:\n“Make six bullpen pitchers, carry my coffin\nand six ground keepers clear my path.\nHave the umpires bark me out at every base\nIn all their holy wrath.” \nJust as “Go Cubs Go” captures the faith of Cubs fans both in 1984 and 2015 – “Hey Chicago, whaddya say, the Cubs are gonna win today!” — “Last Request” captures the flip side of Cubs fandom: “You the living, you’re stuck here with the Cubs – so it’s me that feels sorry for you!”\nBoth songs are well worth a listen, even for diehard Mets fans who currently have no empathy for their Windy City counterparts. So do that now….\nYou’re back? I hope so because… SPOILER ALERT…. there’s more, as I warned at the top of this post.\nGoodman, born in 1948, was 24 when “City of New Orleans” became a hit and he in his mid-30s when “Dying Cubs Fan’s Last Request” was released.\nThe latter song had special poignancy for Goodman, because he was diagnosed with leukemia when he was in college. He still married and had three children, but his friends say he lived with a deep sense of living on borrowed time.\nStill, it was “Go Cubs Go” that captured Chicago in 1984 — and that magical season led the Cubs to choose Goodman to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before the first Cubs playoff game in 39 years.\nBut on Sept. 20, 1984 — four days before the Cubs officially clinched their ticket to the postseason – Goodman died at age 36 of leukemia, 16 years after his initial diagnosis.\nThe Cubs won that first playoff game a week later anyway — and they won Game 2 as well. If they could win just one of three games in San Diego, then, the Cubs finally were going back to the World Series.\nSo which Goodman song narrative prevailed, in the weeks after his death? Well, the Cubs lost all three games – the latter two in excruciating fashion.\nTime marched on — the Willie Nelson version of “City of New Orleans,” released in mid-1984, won Goodman a posthumous songwriting Grammy in 1985.\nThe Cubs, meanwhile, returned to the postseason in 1989, 1998, 2003, 2007, and 2008 — and came up empty each time, with the 2003 loss serving a particularly infamous near-miss a la 1984 (google “Steve Bartman” if necessary).\nSo as of today, Goodman’s “Last Request” lyric spoken by the main character remains accurate:\n“He told his friends, ‘You know the law of averages says:\nAnything will happen that can.’\nThat’s what it says.\n“But the last time the Cubs won a National League pennant,\nWas the year we dropped the bomb on Japan.” \nHow do I know all this, being a lifelong New Jerseyan/New Yorker?\nMy first trip to Wrigley came in summer 1986, the year the Mets steamrollered the National League and eventually gutted their way through a high-wire postseason to a World Series championship (yes, their last – and I was in the stands behind home plate for the deciding Game 7, courtesy of a ticket from the man blamed most for the 1970s trade of Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver to Cincinnati. That tale I’ll save for another day).\nI heard “Last Request” frequently during that 1986 Chicago weekend, and found it as delightful as the city itself. That induced annual summer visits (the 11th such pilgrimage including my first meeting my future wife).\nWrigley visits are not an annual occurrence anymore, but seven or eight years ago I returned and saw a pair of Cubs victories from — per tradition — the bleachers. That’s the first time I recalled hearing “Go Cubs Go,” and it held a definite charm. Turns out the song was revived after a two-decade absence as the Cubs became pennant contenders.\nI went back a couple of years later as well — two more games, two more Cubs wins, two more “Go Cubs Go” sing-a-longs exiting Wrigley and en route to the surrounding Wrigleyville neighborhood.\nGetting back to this series — where do the Cubs go from here?\nAfter two games, it doesn’t look so good for them. Again.\nBut all I know is that either way, the late, great Steve Goodman — gone now for more than 30 years — will have just the song for current Cubs fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:31:49.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
