Defensemen Garrett Noonan and Steve Weinstein, and forwards Christiaan Minella and Eric Robinson scored the goals for the Cyclones, who scored three times within the first five minutes of a period. \nAfter a scoreless opening period that ended with a thrilling fight between Cincinnati’s Jaynen Rissling and Kalamazoo’s Eric Kattelus, the Cyclones drew first blood just 1:17 into the second while on the power play, when Robinson cut in front of the net and threw a shot on goal that was initially kicked out, but following up the play was Noonan who slammed it past Kalamazoo goalie Joel Martin, giving the Cyclones a 1-0 lead. \nThat lead became 2-0 a few minutes later when a puck that was deflected into the air was batted down by Kalamazoo’s Darren Archibald and into the net, 4:15 into the second. Minella was given credit for the goal, as he was the last Cyclone to touch it. \nThe Wings’ offense struck midway through the frame when forward Justin Kovacs lit the lamp, cutting Cincinnati’s lead to 2-1 after 40 minutes. \nCincinnati pushed their lead to 3-1, just 1:27 into the third, when Robinson stole a Kalamazoo clearing attempt at the far blueline and skated in on Martin, wristing it past him, giving Cincinnati a two-goal cushion. \nCincinnati capped off the big win at the 11:30 mark of the third while on the man advantage, when Weinstein took a pass from forward Peter Quenneville on the side of the net and stuffed it past Martin, sealing the Cyclones’ 4-1 win. \nThe Cyclones outshot Kalamazoo, 34-20, on the night, with Cyclones netminder Brad Thiessen stopping 19 shots to earn his second win of the season. Special teams played a big role for the Cyclones, as the power play converted on two-of-three opportunities, while the penalty kill was a perfect 6-for-6. \nImage and information provided by the Cincinnati Cyclones Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:28:26.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
