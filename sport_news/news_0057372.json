Hatcher’s football career began in the metro league in Muncie, and by the time he reached the fifth grade at Daleville, he’d decided he wanted to attend school somewhere that offered the sport. \nThat revelation led him to Middletown and a Raiders program rich in tradition. He watched wing backs like Jared Bromagem, Dylan Hamm, Zach Cole and Zach York ply their trade in Shenandoah’s time-honored system, and he dreamed of one day joining their ranks. \n“I think it motivates me because it makes me want to, like, one-up everybody that’s been through,” Hatcher said. “And I hope people after me come and want to do better than me.” \nThat’s the rhythm of autumn for the Raiders, an annual renewal of expectations and production mixed with the promise each year could be even better than the last. \nA thing like that doesn’t come around because of one player or one position. It’s the product of a culture built to support and sustain winning. \nAt Shenandoah, that culture is based in an unselfish devotion to the team. \n“We’re very fortunate to be in a situation where we’ve got kids that they really don’t care who gets the carries or who gets the yards as long as it’s whatever’s best for our team,” Raiders coach Scott Widner said. “We’ve gotta have that sort of attitude in order to be successful.” \nIt’s at the heart of Shenandoah’s multiple-option running game. The Raiders average 373.4 rushing yards per contest, and four players have at least 50 carries. \nFullback Bobby Pierce has gotten the bulk of the workload with 113 attempts. Hatcher is not far behind with 87 carries, and quarterback Brennan Dowden has called his own number 75 times. The other wing back, Patrick Resler, has 50 rushing attempts. \nDowden and Resler are new to the mix — replacing Adam Lovan and J.J. Myers, respectively — but the well-orchestrated machine hardly has missed a beat. \n“It took awhile to get used to the motions and everything,” Hatcher said of mixing in the new blood. “I had to get synced up with them again. It didn’t take long to do that. And once we did, it’s fine.” \nThere are two key reasons this system works so regularly. First, a big and physical offensive line routinely does the grunt work up front. The second is the unselfish nature of the guys running the football. \nIf a player isn’t carrying the rock on a specific play, he’d better be out front leading the blocking at the second level. \n“As far as I’m concerned, it’s more important than carrying the ball,” Widner said. “What you do when you don’t have it is more important than what you do when you do have it. It sounds kind of silly, but if we get great effort from the guys that don’t have it, then it’s going to make the guy that does have it a lot easier.” \nHatcher’s blocking has improved during his junior season. And his running remains off the charts. \nHe broke out a year ago with a team-high 1,249 yards and 14 touchdowns. Along the way, he had four 100-yard games and averaged 9.3 yards per carry. \nThis year, Hatcher already has topped the century mark five times, and he’s averaging 11.2 yards per attempt. He’s coming off a 20-carry, 202-yard game last week at Winchester, and he leads the Raiders with 977 yards and 10 touchdowns for the season. \nOn a team of equals, Hatcher is indisputably the home-run hitter. \n“He’s got the ability to make a big play,” Widner said. “Dalton’s blessed with some speed and some strength, and he’s got the ability to hit the big one any time he touches it. That adds a little bit of a different element because he’s quick enough to do that.” \nMany of Hatcher’s biggest plays come on sweeps around the end, when it becomes a foot race to get beat the defense to the edge. When he wins that race, and there’s nothing but green grass in front of him, the roar of the crowd encourages him to run even faster. \n“It’s the best feeling ever,” Hatcher said. \nBut he’d never be able to do it alone. \nThe threat represented by Pierce (685 yards, seven touchdowns), Dowden (518 yards, eight touchdowns) and Resler (297 yards, four touchdows) keeps defenses honest. And the host of blockers keep Hatcher clean. \nIt’s a system that’s proven its worth again and again. Each autumn, the cycle is renewed. \nAnd, on every snap, Hatcher is looking for the ultimate pay off. \n“Oh, yeah,” he said. “I want to take it for a long one.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:13:17.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
