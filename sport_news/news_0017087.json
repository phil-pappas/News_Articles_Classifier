TERRY PIERSON, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » PERRIS – Apparently, Mountain Pass League behemoth Citrus Hill isn’t quite ready to hand over its crown just yet.\nThe Hawks, who entered Friday’s game riding a 25-game league win streak dating back to 2010, faced what looked to be one of their toughest matchups when unbeaten San Jacinto came in looking to not only end Citrus Hill’s streak, but continue their own winning ways and put themselves in position for a league title.\nThat narrative was put to rest quickly as Citrus Hill dominated on both sides of the ball on the way to a 40-0 victory.\nThe score could have been even more one-sided as the Hawks’ defense shut down the Tigers (6-1, 1-1), who entered with the highest scoring offense in the league, and running back Devin Floyd did the rest, rushing for 247 yards and two touchdowns.\nThe Hawks (5-2, 2-0) were up 30-0 at the half and the Tigers had no answers on either side of the ball.\n“They did a great job scheming defensively what we do well and stopping us,” San Jacinto coach Aric Galliano said, adding the Hawks also changed things up on offense by using a fullback.\nCitrus Hill scored on its first five possessions and set the defensive tone early by picking off Tiger quarterback Isiah Bolding on the first series.\n“We don’t underestimate anybody,” said Floyd, whose 65-yard touchdown run up the middle and through the Tiger defense early in the second quarter put the Hawks up 23-0.\nKicker Manny Berz followed with a pooch kickoff that was recovered by Citrus Hill and eventually turned into a score when Dumar Fisher capped the short drive with a 5-yard touchdown. Fisher scored two touchdowns and Berz added a pair of field goals. Jaquan Blackwell also scored on a 16-yard pass from Elijah Matthews.\n“We always expect to win,” Floyd said. “That’s our history.”\nSan Jacinto, coming off an emotional win last week at rival Hemet, will have to regroup. Last season, the Hawks handed the Tigers their only league loss, 59-17, but San Jacinto finished strong to reach the postseason.\n“That’s the challenge,” Galliano said. “We’ve got to get the kids to understand this isn’t the end all. We’re still fighting for a playoff berth.”\nBolding finished just 3 of 11 for 61 yards. Allen Makarov led the Tigers with 68 yards.\nFloyd was the workhorse for Citrus Hill, carrying the ball 26 times. He carried 19 times in the first half and had 205 yards by the half.\nContact the writer: asteele@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwcqye-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl059.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwcqyf-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl07d.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwcqyh-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl08l.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwcqye-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl059.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwcqyg-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl08j.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwcqye-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl05c.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwcqyf-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl07d.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwcqyg-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl08j.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwcqyh-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl08l.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwcqyf-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl07b.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwcqyf-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl07b.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwcqye-b88539889z.120151016234709000gvtcl05c.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:27:09.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
