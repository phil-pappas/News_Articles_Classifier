Worried. Anxious. Even though his team at Coast Guard Academy, undefeated in the New England Football Conference at the time, was about to play Curry and the league’s last-ranked offense. \nTurns out George’s angst was justified. \nThe Bears didn’t merely lose their first league game of the season Saturday, but potentially something worse came into play: The thought of finishing the season, with a conference championship still within reach, without starting quarterback Derek Victory. \nVictory injured his thumb during Coast Guard’s first series, a prelude to a hideous 42-14 loss. The Bears are 4-3 overall and 3-1 in the league. They’ll win the NEFC with wins over Nichols, Western New England and Endicott, a daunting challenge even with Victory. \nVictory underwent an X-rays after the Bears returned to campus. George said more will be known Monday. \n“In retrospect,” George said, “we came back from 14 down at Maine Maritime, we had this great win over MIT, maybe we hit a lull. I can’t say I saw it this week because I thought we practiced well. But maybe we did.” \nVictory’s absence, coupled with the struggles of Coast Guard’s normally reliable defense, produced a 28-0 deficit at halftime. \n“I knew Curry had talent,” George said. “That freshman quarterback (Riley Cote), I looked around and said, ‘how many of you guys are first-team all-state?’” \nCote threw for 351 yards and four touchdowns and ran for two more. His second rushing touchdown of the second period gave the Colonels (3-4, 2-2) a 21-0 lead at the time. \n“We didn’t make tackles and got beat on some deep balls,” George said. \nBackup Adam Davis of Griswold pinch-hit for Victory and finished 13-for-25 for 117 yards and a touchdown. \n“It was definitely a change of pace,” Davis said, alluding to the sudden call to duty. “The guys were supportive. It was all positive. It was just one of those days for the team.” \nFreshman Ethan Goldcamp was 1 of 5 for 12 yards in the first action of his career in the fourth quarter. The Colonels finished with 533 yards of total offense, 182 on the ground, while the Bears finished with 193 total yards, 141 in the air. \nThe Bears finally scored when Davis threw his first career touchdown, a 10-yard pass to senior Jordan Groff with 6:57 left in the third quarter. \nCoast Guard freshman running back Colin Cashin closed the scoring with his first career touchdown, a 6-yard run with 1:36 left. Senior Mark Behne’s 47-yard punt return set the Bears up at the Colonel 29-yard line. \nGroff (27 yards) and sophomore tight end Cody Bain (23 yards) each had four receptions to lead Coast Guard. Senior Mike Clancy had 10 carries for 32 yards to lead the Bears on the ground. \nSophomore cornerback Will Daniels had seven tackles to lead the Bears' defense, while Joe Rizzardi added six solo tackles to go with his interception, which was the only turnover in the game. \nGeorge knows he may have to face the reality of the remainder of the season without Victory. \n“But more importantly,” he said, “the guys need to understand that Nichols can do this to them, too. It’s the nature of Coast Guard football. We’re not a powerhouse team. We can beat anybody by one and lose to anyone by 20.” \nCoast Guard is home next week with Nichols. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. at Cadet Memorial Field. \nm.dimauro@theday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:32:17.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
