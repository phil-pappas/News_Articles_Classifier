(Photo: AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWashington Redskins defensive end and former Central football star Ryan Kerrigan was unable to finish Sunday's game against Tampa Bay after suffering a fractured right hand in the first quarter, according ESPN's John Keim, and will see a specialist on Monday. \nHe was injured on the final play of the opening quarter, a seven-yard run from Tampa Bay running back Charles Sims. Kerrigan is in danger of missing a game for the first time in his five-year career with Washington. He tore his lateral meniscus early in the 2013 season, but played the entire season. \nKerrigan attended Central from 2003-06 and started as an offensive lineman, then became a standout defensive player and finished his Bearcats career with a 40-11 record, advancing to regionals three times. He attended Purdue from 2007-10 and was named second-team All Big-Ten as a junior and was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year as a senior. \nHe was selected No. 16 overall in the 2011 NFL Draft by Washington and has amassed 193 tackles and 41.5 sacks during his five-year career. \nKerrigan's status for the rest of the season is unknown, but Keim expressed optimism he could return before the season is finished.
