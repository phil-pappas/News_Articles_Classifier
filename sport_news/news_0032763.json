NFL: Chiefs’ Charles injured in loss to Bears 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The season might be over for Pro Bowl running back Jamaal Charles . Maybe for the Kansas City Chiefs , too. \nJay Cutler led Chicago to two fourth-quarter touchdowns Sunday, the second on a toss to Matt Forte with 18 seconds remaining, as the Bears rallied for an 18-17 victory after the Kansas City running back sustained what appears to be a torn ACL in his right knee. \nIt was the fourth straight defeat for the Chiefs (1-4), whose playoff hopes are already fading. \n“What’s the truth? I think that’s the important part,” Kansas City head coach Andy Reid said. “You’re put in a situation like this, you have to make plays. We didn’t do that.” \nThe Chiefs were leading 17-3 in the third quarter when Charles went down while trying to make a cut. The preliminary diagnosis was a torn ligament and he’ll have an MRI exam Monday. \nWith him out of the game, the Bears seized momentum. \nAfter Robbie Gould ’s second field goal got them going, Cutler led an 88-yard drive that he capped with a 22-yard pass to Marquess Wilson with 3:05 left. The two-point conversion came up short, but the Bears’ defense responded by forcing a three-and-out. \nWith help from a pass-interference call on rookie Marcus Peters , the Bears (2-3) quickly moved downfield. On their final play, Cutler took a snap, dropped the ball, grabbed it and hit Forte with a pass as he ran past safety Husain Abdullah in the end zone for the go-ahead score. \n“There’s a lot of pride in that offensive huddle,” Cutler said. “Those guys fought hard.” Latest videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:31:55.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
