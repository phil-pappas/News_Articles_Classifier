Allison Niccum, allisonniccum.com Enlarge photo» Summary \nWith two weeks remaining in Utah high school football's regular season, the postseason is already starting to come into view, as numerous teams wrapped up playoff berths with wins this past week. Here's a list of who's in and who's out. \nWith two weeks remaining in Utah high school football 's regular season, the postseason is already starting to come into view. \nNumerous teams wrapped up playoff berths with wins this past week, including region front-runners Sky View, Mountain Crest, Bingham, Jordan and Lone Peak in 5A; and each of the league leaders in the 4A ranks — East, Olympus, Timpview and Springville. \nEast and Olympus are the only members of that playoff-clinching 5A/4A group that don't have at least seven wins this season. \nWith much thanks to Utah football guru and historian George Felt, who does such a tremendous job keeping track of all things pertaining to prep football in the state, you'll find a complete list — best as he can figure it — at the end of this story. \nOf course, we're accustomed to seeing some of those big dogs like defending state champions Bingham and Timpview, along with other tradition-rich schools like Jordan, Davis, East, Logan and Juan Diego, make postseason appearances seemingly every year. \nBut several other schools in the state are enjoying historic seasons for their programs this year. \nUp north, Cache Valley rivals Sky View and Mountain Crest continued on their unbeaten collision course with solid wins this week. The Bobcats of Sky View (8-0) are having their best season since they started 11-0 in 2006, and the Mustangs from Mountain Crest are 7-0 for the first time since 1998. \nThose two teams are tied for the top spot in Region 1 at 4-0 and, should they both win this week, they'll tangle for the league title in a battle of unbeatens on Oct. 23 at Sky View. \nRegion 4 leader Lone Peak (8-0) boasts its best record at this juncture of the season since the Knights' glorious state championship season in 2011, when they rolled to a perfect 14-0 mark. \nAnother Utah County squad, Springville, is also rolling along at 8-0 for the first time since it started the 2004 season with 10 straight wins. \nAnd you'd have to go all the way back to 1992 to find the last time when Kearns was 7-1, like it is right now. The Cougars started that '92 season 10-1. \nAnd Diamond Ranch, with a slick 6-0 slate, is enjoying its best season in school history. Diamond Ranch will face Kanab (2-0, 6-2) in a clash of 1A South league leaders on Friday. \nDavis (7-0) and South Summit (8-0) both remain among the ranks of the unbeaten as well. \nIn a classic Summit meeting, South Summit faces North Summit (6-2) this week in a matchup for 2A North supremacy. Both Summit schools are 4-0 in region play. \nAlso this week, in which most prep teams play on Wednesday due to the annual UEA meetings, Davis will duel Hunter in a battle between teams that are tied atop the Region 2 standings at 4-0. \nA similar situation finds Bingham and Jordan, the Deseret News' two top-ranked teams in the entire state — both 4-0 in Region 3 and 7-1 overall — colliding on the Beetdiggers' field in a most promising showdown. \nAnd in Region 5, Highland and East — both 3-0 in league play and 5-2 on the season — square off this week as well at East. \nThus far, a total of 45 teams have already locked up playoff berths, and 11 more teams have clinched at least a tie for a postseason spot. Only five schools have been mathematically eliminated from postseason contention. \nAs far as Mr. Felt can ascertain, here's who's in and out of the state playoff mix at this juncture: \nRegion 1: Mountain Crest and Sky View are in, and Fremont has clinched at least a tie for a berth. \nRegion 2: Davis and Hunter are in; Syracuse has clinched a tie, and West is eliminated. \nRegion 3: Bingham and Jordan are in, and Brighton has clinched tie. \nRegion 4: Lone Peak and Herriman are in; Riverton is eliminated. \nRegion 5: East and Highland are in; Bountiful has clinched a tie. \nRegion 6: Olympus and Kearns are in, with Olympus having clinched the No. 1 seed and a tie for the region title, and Kearns having clinched the No. 2 seed.
