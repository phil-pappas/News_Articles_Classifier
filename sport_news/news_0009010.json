Due to the prevailing weather conditions warm currents of air were not available that aid paragliders in flying. The competing pilots just flew for practice and landed at the Bir landing site. Glamour was added to the Paragliding World Cup today with the Bollywood actress Preity Zinta visiting Billing. “I belong to Himachal Pradesh and it gives me great pleasure to come to the Paragliding World Cup. I wish all the pilots taking part in the competition very enjoyable and safe flights,” said Preity Zinta before leaping off the mountain for a tandem flight much to the delight of those present. The presence of Preity Zinta cheered the tourists and participants in otherwise dismal day due to the overcast weather conditions. Sudhir Sharma, Minister for Urban Development and president of Billing Paragliding Association, was also present on the occasion. Organizers said heavy cloud cover forced them to cancel the first task of the AAI Paragliding World Cup that involved a flight path of 53 km. “We cancelled the first task of the meet in the interest of the safety of pilots because the weather today was not conducive for flying,” said a spokesperson of the task committee. As per the rules of the Paragliding World Cup, a minimum of two tasks are mandatory for calculation of points. Weather reports say the cloud cover is likely to remain heavy even tomorrow. With the cancellation of the today’s task, the AAI Paragliding World Cup will now be contested over six tasks, according to the office of the meet director, Debu Choudhury. How paragliding started\nThe Billing that is now among the top sites for paragliding in the world was first found by Palampur-based local Naveen Sareen. Naveen Sareen and his brother organized first competition of hand gliding at Billing in 1984. About 45 pilots, mostly foreigners, had participated in the event. At that time Four Square, cigarette company, had sponsored the event. For a long time many foreign free flyers used to do hand gliding from Billing. Naveen Sareen remembers that the road from Bir to Billing was so bad that it was safe to fly down rather than driving from Billing to Bir. Paragliding started here in late nineties. It was also started by free flying foreign pilots who came to Billing by taking reference from other pilots and internet. Billing as a paragliding site Billing is considered among the best take off sites in the world due to presence of large open valley extending across kilometres on one side of the takeoff site and the Dhauladhar mountains in the backdrop on the other side. However, the presence of high tension electricity wires right across the valley extending from Billing is a drawback. Since most of the land on which take off in Billing is located in part of reserve forest land, there is hardly any scope for development. The first registered body The Billing Paragliding Association (BPA), the first registered body to control the events of paragliding being organized at Billing, was formed in 2006. It is headed by the minister for Urban Development Himachal, Sudhir Sharma. It successfully organised Pre-World Cup of paragliding at the same venue in 2013. The BPA is the only organization recognised by Aero Club of India, which in turn is the only body recognised by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the governing world body for air sports, and the Paragliding World Cup Association (PWCA). The FAI was formed in 1905. As a competitive sport, paragliding has already featured in South-East Asian Games and the Asian Beach Games. Paragliding was also short-listed in the initial list of new events for the 2020 Olympics, but will now be considered for the 2024 Olympic Games. However, some people feel that control of paragliding at Billing by an organization like (BPA) that is headed by influential politicians might become a bottleneck for free fliers who have explored and made Billing famous across last three decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:08:40.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
