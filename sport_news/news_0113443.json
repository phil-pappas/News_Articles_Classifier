The car sustained moderate front end damage. \nJackson appeared uninjured but was taken to the Seahawks facility so team personnel could evaluate him, police said. \nPolice said there was no evidence that Jackson was racing, as had been reported by TMZ. \nPolice said Jackson remained on scene until officers could speak to him and was \"polite and cooperative.\" \nThe accident comes the same day the Seahawks re-activated fullback Derrick Coleman to the 53-man roster after he was suspended last week following an alleged hit and run in Bellevue. \nHe's under investigation for vehicular assault and felony hit and run but prosecutors say it could be several weeks before a decision on charges.
