Well that's not up for argument now following failure to get visa clearance on time to make the Black Stars game on Tuesday. \nSwitzerland based Ebenezer Assifuah, Richmond Boakye Yiadom (on loan at Dutch side, Roda JC) and Denmark based Daniel Amartey also suffered similar fates, a situation which has resulted in a complete overhaul of the team due to the unavailability of other key players too due to injury. \n\"They did not refuse them but (were given) dates after the game,\" a reliable source in the Black Stars camp in Washington told Allsports.com.gh. \nMeanwhile, Coach Avram Grant has named his 18-man squad for the friendly against Canada including four potential debutants, Llyod Sam, Kwadwo Poku, Phil Ofosu-Ayew and Gideon Baah. \nFull Squad Razak Braimah (Cordoba, Spain) and Fatau Dauda (AshGold) \nDefenders Harrison Afful (Columbus Crew, USA), (Phil Ofosu-Ayeh, Eintracht Braunschweig, Germany), Jeffery Schlupp (Leicester City, England), Gideon Baah (HJK Helsinki, Finland), John Boye (Sivasspor, Turkey), Edwin Gyimah (Orlando Pirates, South Africa), \nMidfielders Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu (Udinese, Italy), Afriyie Acquah (Torino, Italy), Mubarak Wakaso (Las Palmas, Spain), Lloyd Ekow Sam (New York Red Bulls, USA) Bernard Mensah (Getafe, Spain), Alfred Duncan (Sassuolo, Italy), and Kwadwo Poku (New York City FC, USA) \nStrikers Jordan Ayew (Aston Villa, England), Abdul Majeed Waris, (Lorient, France) and David Accam (Chicago Fire, USA) \nThe game will be played at the RFK Stadium in Washington DC on Tuesday wth kick-off time 19:30 GMT.
