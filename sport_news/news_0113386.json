The trick play gave LSU a 35-28 lead against the Florida Gators on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015, at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, La. Special teams — served scattered , not covered and smothered — are the main course of this week's Monday Morning SEC Hot Cakes ... hot takes not available until the lunch menu rolls over at 10:30 a.m...\nCoaches cringe at the thought of kickers using their hands and not their feet to determine the outcomes of games. This Saturday in college football, there were a lot of pained expressions.\nThe hand-eye coordination of Michigan's punter turned the Big House into a horror scene on Saturday, but down at Tiger Stadium an equally terrified kicker overcame his fears and delivered a score (instead of giving one away) for the LSU Tigers.\nTrent Domingue couldn't stop his hands from shaking before or during LSU's fake field goal, but the junior from Mandeville, La., found the end zone anyway despite bobbling a perfect pitch for what felt like an eternity during his game-winning 16-yard score.\n\"My whole body was shaking,\" Domingue said. \"Usually I like to think I can catch pretty well, but maybe I shouldn't think that anymore.\"\nFrom Ann Arbor, Mich., to Baton Rouge, La., to College Station, Texas, special teams starred on some of the game's biggest stages on Saturday, and helped bring into better focus the race for the playoff. The two-loss Wolverines are now most likely out of the running for the College Football Playoff while undefeated LSU bolstered its case as one of the top teams in the country.\nThen there's Alabama, which already has one loss this season that featured a major special teams blunder. The Crimson Tide might have improved on special teams after that loss to Ole Miss, but any gains were certainly lost against Texas A&M. More than a handful of errors might have doomed Alabama if not for a school-record three interception returns for touchdowns.\nThe weekend's high-profile results offered an important lesson:\nCoaches, devalue kickers and special teams at your own peril, especially in games when the goofy factor of high-pressure situations gets dialed up a few degrees.\nTeams coached by Les Miles seem prone to sudden plays of madness, but that element of unpredictability is all part of the genius, apparently. Miles called for a fake field goal against Florida when all he needed was three points to take a fourth-quarter lead at home. The Gators never suspected the unorthodox play call. Needing a block to keep the score tied, Florida was caught by complete surprise by the fake.\n\"It was a hat trick,\" LSU running back Leonard Fournette said.\nA testament to just how wide open that play actual was: Despite the kicker bobbling the pitch all the way down the field, Domingue still outraced Gators cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III into the end zone for the go-ahead touchdown. Hargreaves is a projected Top 10 pick and one of the fastest players in the SEC.\nA key tenant of the Miles playbook: Why settle for three points when seven is a safe bet?\nAnother tenant: Listen to the kicker.\nAs a general rule, kickers are expected to keep low profiles in the team locker room, at practice and during games. They mostly stay to themselves, but Domingue, according to teammates, apparently is an outlier — a kicker the actual football players and coaches respect.\nThat's great and everything, but perhaps only one coach in the country would consider taking advice from a kicker — respected or not — with a game on the line. That's apparently what happened moments before the fake, though. Domingue actually suggested the play to his coach.\nThe kid called his own number, and Miles went along with the idea.\n\"I could see the light bulb go off above his head,\" Domingue said.\nHe might have had tremors of terror during the actual play, but it takes uncommon guts for a kicker to interrupt his coach during the pressing fourth-quarter crush of a tie game between undefeated SEC rivals and suggest a fake field goal.\n\"I don't know what got into me,\" Domingue said.\nLSU is now the SEC's lone undefeated team, but a divisional title (and a spot in the SEC championship game) is far from determined. LSU's remaining SEC schedule includes road games at Alabama and Ole Miss. LSU arguable has the most difficult schedule of any remaining contenders.\nSEC POLL OF POWER\n14. Vanderbilt (2-4, 0-3): Doesn't matter who's coaching the other team when the offense gives it away five times.\n13. South Carolina (3-4, 1-4): Former coach Steve Spurrier appeared on ESPN GameDay the week he retired. Hopefully Spurdog will join the crew permanently.\n12. Kentucky (4-2, 2-2): Did the Wildcats go away from Boom Williams too early?\n11. Auburn (4-2, 1-2): Six wins are doable, people.\n10. Arkansas (2-4, 1-2): Opened as 4-point favorites against Auburn, but line quickly went to 5 ½.\n9. Missouri (4-3, 1-3): Maybe next time Gary Pinkel's contract should feature an incentive for first downs. The Tigers had six in their 9-6 loss to Georgia.\n8. Tennessee (3-3, 1-3): Anonymous author of famous Tennessee message board screed entitled \"Why I Hate the Alabama Crimson Tide\" has emerged. Enjoy.\n7. Georgia (5-2, 3-2): Backfield averaged 2.7 yards per carry without injured running back Nick Chubb...and the Dawgs won!\n6. Mississippi State (5-2, 1-2): Quarterback Dak Prescott accounted for four touchdowns against Louisiana Tech (one rushing), and still hasn't throw a pick this season (11 touchdowns).\n5. Texas A&M (5-1, 2-1): Boy, was I wrong about the Aggies .\n4. Ole Miss (5-2, 2-1): Fourth best team in the SEC just lost to Memphis. Let that sink in.\n3. Florida: (6-1, 4-1): Secondary obviously didn't practice underthrown Brandon Harris desperation heaves last week.\n2. Alabama (6-1, 3-1): Maybe now Minkah Fitzpatrick, he of two pick-sixes, won't be listed as a third-string cornerback, OR second-string.\n1a. LSU (6-0, 4-0): Fournette rushed for career-high 31 attempts, and afterwards said he was ready for Alabama .\n'BLOOD SHOTS'\nAfter physically abusing what he later called the most physical defense in the SEC, Fournette noted that the Gators' defenders went heavy on the cheap shots during the game's many scrums and dogpiles. Fournette then described some of the bruises he absorbed with an interesting turn of phrase.\n\"We never have a plan for how many carries I'm going to get, but I feel great right now — a couple blood shots on me, but it's nothing I can't handle,\" Fournette said.\nNow entering your football vocabulary: blood shots, or hits so violent they cause contusions.\nFournette went on to say that one of Florida's players poked him in the eye.\n\"It made me upset, so I just had to put the team on my back in the fourth quarter,\" he said. \"You can't really tell who it is because there are like six people on top of you. The only thing you see are hands. Coach Miles told us it was going to be like a street fight, and I can't take anything away from Florida's defense.\"\nNote to Alabama: Don't get Fournette angry with any cheap shots. You wouldn't like him when he's angry.\nTHIRD SATURDAY IN OCTOBER\nQuick spitters...\n— It was seen as a great moral victory last season when Tennessee scored 20 points in a loss against Alabama. Previously, Tennessee had failed to score 20 points against an Alabama team coached by Nick Saban.\n— Alabama has won eight in a row over Tennessee, and this is the 98th installment of the rivalry. Alabama leads the all-time series 51-38-7. Tennessee has had four head coaches in nine seasons during the Saban Era.\n— Tennessee is 2-28 against teams ranked in the AP Top 15 since 2007. In other words, Alabama has more national championships since Saban took over than Tennessee has victories against teams ranked in the AP Top 15.\nTHROWING SHADE\nTennessee's media guide has no love for Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin, who coached at UT for one memorable season.\n Dare I say no former head coach in the country other than Lane Kiffin at Tennessee gets introduced in a media guide as someone's son? This is some serious sports-information shade.\nNow the offensive coordinator at Alabama, Kiffin's offense sputtered against Arkansas two weeks ago, but Alabama's offensive line found pushing around Texas A&M a little easier.\nOn a day quarterback Jake Coker didn't have much to do, Alabama rushed for 258 yards (236 from Derrick Henry).\nUNDERSIZED AGGIES\nIs Texas A&M recruiting big enough linemen to beat Alabama? It's a simple, but legitimate question after another blowout loss to the Crimson Tide. Texas A&M was defeated 41-23 on Saturday after losing 59-0 last year. Texas A&M's defensive front was gashed repeatedly by Alabama's offensive line, and the Aggies' offensive line couldn't keep Alabama defenders out of the backfield.\nMobility along his offensive front is important to Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin, but against elite SEC defenses that strategy has the tendency to create some bad matchups. Some of the chatter about the Aggies' just not being physical enough to hang with Alabama is a little silly, but not big enough? Consider that Texas A&M's two-deep offensive line gave up an average of about 10 pounds to Alabama's starting defensive front.\nPut another way, Alabama's linebackers were only about 50 pounds lighter than Texas A&M's offensive guards.\nAlabama scored 24 points off four interceptions against Texas A&M. The Crimson Tide's secondary has developed quickly this season, but statistics that extreme don't happen without constant pressure on the opposing quarterback. Aggies' sophomore quarterback Kyle Allen was sacked six times, and Alabama recorded a total of 12 tackles for loss.\nJoseph Goodman is a senior reporter and columnist for Alabama Media Group.
