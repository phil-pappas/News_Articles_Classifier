We would like to convince them that getting the football is not everything. \n\"If a player hits the ball and then endangers the opponent, he is convinced that the job was done correctly.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:22.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
