They got in behind us and had a few chances but we managed to sort that out between ourselves on the pitch.\" \nNorwich had dominated the opening stages but West Brom's back line again held firm, meaning Rondon's header inside the opening minute of the second half proved enough to separate the sides. \n\"The goal settled us,\" added Evans. \n\"They put us under pressure for the final 20 minutes or so but we ground out the result and it was another great away victory. They were quite strong and got the ball out wide. They used that threat but I thought our full-backs defended really well in one-on-one situations.\" \nNorwich have lost three league games in succession and face their own tricky run of fixtures between now and Christmas. \nManager Alex Neil made the decision to change his defence following the 6-2 defeat at Newcastle as Russell Martin moved to full-back and Ryan Bennett came in to partner Sebastien Bassong in the middle. \nIt was the 25-year-old's first league start since April and, despite the result, Bennett is keen to remain in Neil's side in the coming weeks. \n\"Hopefully I can do well and stay in the team,\" he said. \n\"When you're not in the side you've got to keep working. That's what I've done and I'm looking to reap the rewards from that now. I've been fortunate to come back into the team. \n\"The result hasn't gone the way I would have liked but we've just got to carry on. We know how difficult this league is and we've got to stick to our beliefs.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:20:17.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
