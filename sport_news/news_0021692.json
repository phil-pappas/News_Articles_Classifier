Quarterback Cade Earl hit receiver Bill Rotnicki with a 19-yard touchdown pass to cut the deficit to 24-21 with 1:26 to play. \nThe Hilltoppers did not recover the ensuing onside kick, and Benet (6-2, 4-2) ran out the clock. \nJoliet Catholic (7-1, 5-1) never led in the game, and the Redwings bottled up Hilltoppers’ running backs Michael Johnson (86 yards rushing) and Ke’Von Johnson (72 yards rushing). \nEarl threw three touchdown passes to account for the Joliet Catholic scores. He threw two to Rotnicki and one to Michael Johnson. \nJoliet Catholic turned the ball over four times in the second half. Michael Johnson fumbled twice and Earl was intercepted twice. \nThe Hilltoppers also were penalized nine times for 92 yards in the game. \n“Benet played very well. They tackled well. They got off their blocks well,\" Sharp said. \"It seemed every time we got something going offensively, there would be a penalty or they would create a turnover. You’re not going to win many games against a good team when you turn the ball over four times. We never got into a rhythm offensively.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:12:06.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
