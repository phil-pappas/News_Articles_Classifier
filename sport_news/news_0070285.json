(Photo: CB Race Photos) 289 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJesse Stovall hopes to put a final exclamation point on what’s been a dream season at this weekend’s Lucas Oil MLRA Fall Nationals at Lucas Oil Speedway in Wheatland. \nThe Billings resident has won 18 feature races, easily the most of his career. \nThe success has him flush with money — at least, that’s what Stovall said a lot of people assume. \nThey would be wrong. \n“I’m probably going to have to sell my (car) hauler to get through the winter,” Stovall said recently. “I have a banker and he’s been really good to me. But when he says it’s time to sell it, I’ll sell it.” \nAll those trips to victory lane, while making for a nice trophy collection, have been for $3,000 or less. Stovall, with a nickname of “The Undertaker” for his aggressive driving style, has won $55,300 in first-place money. \nIn the expensive world of top-level, short-track racing, that’s not enough to eat steak every night. \n“It’s not like people think,” Stovall said. “It takes around $1,000 every week just to pull out of the driveway to go to a race. You’re talking fuel for the hauler, food and expenses for you and your help, entry fees. \n“Now don’t get me wrong,” Stovall added. “It’s been a great year. If somebody had told me back in January that I’d have 18 wins, I’d have laughed at them. \n“But racing in general, it’s so hard to make enough money to break even, let alone make a living. Unless you have a big, corporate style sponsor, it’s hard.” \nStovall, 34, remains hopeful of someone with a fat checkbook offering him season-long support for 2016. It’s why he keeps plugging away, hoping for a chance to compete on a national level. \nMeanwhile, Stovall will look to add two more wins this weekend, where the prize money is $3,000 for Friday night’s winner and $5,000 on Saturday. \nEven a sweep is no guarantee of catching Springfield’s Terry Phillips, who’s seeking to lock down his third series championship. The longtime Ozarks-racing heavyweight has been remarkably consistent and leads Stovall by 44 points — without winning an MLRA race. \n“I’m gonna be there, if he makes a mistake — though I’m not wishing him to,” Stovall said. “Terry’s a good friend and I don’t wish misfortune on him. He has to run bad two nights in a row and he’s so good that the chances of that are slim and none.” \nIt’ll be just the second weekend out in a new Black Diamond race car for Phillips, who has joined Stovall in running the popular late model brand. \n“It’s probably my worst nightmare, him getting one of these cars,” Stovall said. “I told him at the beginning of the year, ‘I’ll have you in one of these by the end of the year’ and sure enough, he has one.” \nIn addition to the MLRA, the Factory Stock Big Buck 50 will pay $4,000 to win on Saturday. USRA B mods also are on the program. \nJ.C. Morton cashes in \nSpringfield’s J.C. Morton crossed the finish line second, behind West Plains’ Logan Hughes, at Saturday’s B Mod Nationals at Legit Speedway south of West Plains. But on Thursday, Morton was declared winner of the $7,500 first prize after a part on Hughes' car was ruled illegal. Morton also won the B mod nationals last year at Springfield Raceway. \nBurrell win again \nFair Grove’s Mickey Burrell is on a recent roll, with two wins in the last month after taking Saturday’s A mod feature at Springfield Raceway. Burrell, featured earlier this year in the News-Leader , beat Matt Dotson and earned $1,000. \nLucas Oil MLRA Fall Nationals \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Friday and 6:30 p.m. Saturday \nWhere: Lucas Oil Speedway in Wheatland \nCars: MLRA Late Model Series along with factory stock and B mod divisions \nAdmission: Friday — $15 adults, $12 seniors, $5 ages 6-15.
