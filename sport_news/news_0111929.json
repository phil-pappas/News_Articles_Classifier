So Sunday's 27-20 victory over the visiting Cowboys, who were playing without their two most important offensive pieces and with their third starting quarterback of the season, was not one for the team to turn its nose up at. \nAt this point, wins are what matter. And the Giants barely got a big one, using touchdowns on offense, defense and kickoff return in the same game for the first time since 1951. Latest Giants stories Touchdowns scored at MetLife Stadium See also Boxscore: Giants vs. Cowboys \nHaving failed to beat Dallas since 2012 -- the day before superstorm Sandy hit this area, to put it in some time perspective -- the Giants (4-3) rebounded from a miserable performance against the Eagles last week to at least temporarily pull themselves back into sole possession of first place in the NFC East. They awaited Sunday night's Eagles game to see if they would remain there alone. \nWhile most players refused to see this as a statement win, it clearly reestablished the team's identity as a scrappy group of gritty players, if not a powerhouse team. Perhaps in the NFL in 2015, a season in which there seem to be far more squads below mediocrity than above it, that will be good enough. \n\"I feel like we have a lot, a lot of talent in that room,\" defensive end Kerry Wynn said. \"If we play the way we play, when we're the best at what we do, I feel like we can go a long way.\" \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nThat it wasn't Eli Manning and the high-octane offense that carried this team to the win adds clout to that thinking. In a game in which their quarterback and playmaking receiver Odell Beckham Jr. were held relatively in check, the Giants found players in other areas to step up. \nFourth-string running back Orleans Darkwa scored the Giants' only offensive touchdown of the game. After Dallas tied the score at 20-20, former Cowboy Dwayne Harris returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown with 7:01 remaining. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie had two interceptions, including one that he returned 58 yards for a touchdown. And Myles White -- perhaps the most anonymous player on the team -- was in the right spot to recover a muffed punt by the Cowboys' Cole Beasley in the final minute to secure the win. Giants Giants vs. Cowboys \n\"How about Myles coming up with that ball?\" Coughlin said. \nPerhaps the most important aspect of the win was how it changed the trajectory of the season. The eerie similarities to last year's downward spiral were beginning to mount, including a trouncing in Philly after a 3-2 start. A year ago, that loss led to one against Dallas the following week -- and another five straight beyond that -- but the Giants had anti-lock brakes this time and avoided a prolonged skid. \n\"All that stuff about last year and this, that and the other,\" defensive end Robert Ayers said. \"Last year's last year. Every year is a new year. I'm just happy to be in a situation where we can control things a little bit.\" \nMaybe Tony Romo and Dez Bryant would have had better luck on the field than on the sideline, but Rodgers-Cromartie and the Giants took advantage of the backups early in the third quarter to give themselves a lead after trailing 13-10 at the half. Matt Cassel's pass for Terrance Williams was picked off by Rodgers-Cromartie, who returned it 58 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. Knowing he would score, he had his hand in the air by the time he was at the Dallas 40. It was his second TD of the season against Dallas after a 57-yard fumble recovery in the opener. \nThe next Cowboys possession also ended with an interception, as Brandon Meriweather picked off a severely underthrown floater of a deep pass from Cassel to Williams at the 1. Giants History of the Giants-Cowboys rivalry \nPinned against their own goal line, the Giants used a one-handed 44-yard catch by Rueben Randle and a 39-yard run by Shane Vereen on back-to-back plays to get to the 11. The drive stalled there, though, and Josh Brown's field goal made it 20-13. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nRodgers-Cromartie had a second interception on the first play of the fourth quarter, but the Giants were unable to convert it into points. That missed opportunity loomed large when the Cowboys drove 80 yards in nine plays to tie the score at 20 with 7:14 left. Cassel rebounded from his turnovers to hit Williams for a key third-and-9 completion of 21 yards along the sideline and then found Devin Street in the end zone, his toes anchored against the out-of-bounds markings, for a 25-yard touchdown. \nRodgers-Cromartie was not on the field for those two completions; he'd been sidelined earlier with a finger injury. \nHarris'return quickly restored momentum to the Giants, though. The Cowboys got to the Giants' 30 before Markus Kuhn sacked Cassel, Meriweather blitzed and batted a pass, and Devin Wade, Rodgers-Cromartie and Jonathan Casillas converged to tackle James Hanna for a short gain on fourth-and-8 with 1:48 remaining to seal the win. \nThe Giants punted 12 seconds later, but Beasley couldn't handle the kick and White recovered it at the 16 for the final kneel-downs. \nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:45:43.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
