I guess a generational change in Australian cricket.\n\"We are gonna be prepared well for the first Test match against New Zealand at the Gabba,\" he vowed.\n\"I'm really excited about leading this team.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:38:42.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
