He hasn’t protected Tom Brady ’s blind side since.\nBut without left tackle Nate Solder , who was placed on injured reserve Wednesday with a torn biceps, it’s absolutely worth wondering if the Patriots would shift Vollmer back to the left side. After all, he is their best offensive lineman, and left tackle is the most important position up front, particularly when Brady’s health is at stake.\n“It’s probably up to coach, not to me,” Vollmer said.\nConsider this: The Patriots have rotated their offensive linemen at an unprecedented pace this season, but Vollmer never switched sides. The strategy behind the rotations had multiple layers, but it included the chance to give players additional experience in the event of an injury. If they had a contingency plan that involved Vollmer at left tackle, they would have likely unveiled it by now.\nVollmer was coy yesterday when responding to a series of questions about his chances to switch sides. Maybe that was by design to force the Colts or other future opponents to prepare for the possibility.\nCould he play left tackle if necessary?\n“You know, we’ll see,” Vollmer said.\nVollmer has likely practiced at left tackle at some point since the conclusion of the 2009 season, but he also wouldn’t discuss those specifics.\n“I don’t know,” Vollmer said. “I don’t want to get into details and stuff. It’s not something I’ve never done before. We’ll see what happens.”\nMaybe Vollmer will remain on the right side. Maybe not. But he has sufficiently kept everyone guessing.\n“I don’t know,” Vollmer said when asked again about changing positions. “We’ll find out, I guess.”\nNew addition\nPats cornerback Rashaan Melvin doesn’t lack any confidence, that’s for sure.\n“I think I’m a very talented guy, confident,” Melvin said yesterday when asked to describe himself. “I play with a lot of confidence. I believe in myself. I trust in my abilities on and off the field. I’m a highly confident guy. I play with a strong motor. I have a positive attitude.”\nThe Patriots claimed Melvin off waivers Wednesday after he was released by the Ravens, who benched him in Week 3 before cutting him as part of a sizable roster shakeup due to their 1-4 record.\nRight now, Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan are the Patriots’ top two cornerbacks while Tarell Brown works through a foot injury, and Justin Coleman is next in line. If Brown can’t play Sunday against the Colts, Melvin could be the fourth corner on the depth chart.\nFrom there, who knows? Some of the Patriots’ midseason acquisitions have lasted as little as a day, while others, such as defensive tackle Sealver Siliga , find a more permanent home.\nMelvin believes he’ll be in the latter category.\n“I’m looking forward to making this place my home for my career,” Melvin said.\nInjury notes\nBrown missed his first practice of the regular season and his absence snapped the Pats’ streak of five consecutive practices with perfect attendance (excluding Solder’s absence Wednesday because he was placed on injured reserve). The Patriots have conducted 19 practices, and Brown became just the fourth player (center Bryan Stork , Dominique Easley , Ryan Wendell ) on the active roster to miss a workout for an injury-related reason.\nRunning back Dion Lewis (abdomen) was added to the injury report for the first time this season. The extent of the injury, along with the chance of him playing Sunday, remains unclear.\nGetting ahead\nButler got a kick out of the fact that his Super Bowl XLIX interception has been immortalized in the form of a bobblehead by the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum.\n“It’s cool,” Butler laughed. “I don’t think he looks like me, but it’s cool.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:44:34.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
