He had enough time in between to get his degree at Duke, keep his arm sharp, rehab his knee and surprise the heck out of his manager, John Gibbons, who really didn’t expect any return on this pitching investment in this crazy Blue Jays season. \nThe stress of September was all about avoiding a wild-card game. You remember that? You can’t let it come down to one game. You can’t have something that random. One game. One outcome. Quick victory or painful elimination. \nSo here are the Blue Jays now, in this quixotic October, in their own kind of first-round wild-card game of sorts. One game to win the ALDS. Last round of a fight. Winner take all. \nThe shocking season continues — or it stunningly ends. Just like that. No in-between. Wednesday afternoon will either become something new to add to our sporting lexicon or another series to remember. Remember the time the Leafs almost beat the Los Angeles Kings? Remember when the Raptors had one shot to move on? Remember the Vince Carter jumper at the buzzer? \nSometimes we do a lot more reminiscing in Toronto about great days that weren’t than we ever do about celebrating. \nAnd this has been a baseball season to both remember and celebrate, a time unlike any other, to cherish with all its twists and roster turns, even the winding road of decision-making that led to Stroman starting this afternoon. No one is ready for any of this to end. Not yet, not this soon. It’s been too glorious and too consuming. \nReally, it’s been a Toronto season like none before it. In any sport, at any time. \nThere is another round to play after Wednesday’s game, before the World Series. We’d so forgotten what sporting delirium was like — and we like it, we really like it — and aren’t ready to give it up this easily, stepping back to anything resembling reality. There has been too much reality around here for too long. It’s time for this improbable season to continue. \nJosh Donaldson, who seems to be in the middle of everything that is Blue Jays, was talking in spring training about how the best teams rarely win playoff series or even make it to the playoffs. He said the teams that win instinctively know how to bounce back, stay even-keel, rarely react to all the changing machinations of a long season. \nThe Blue Jays were rather average for 101 games. That seems like another time, another place. Because they were brilliant for most of the final 61 games. And then came the playoffs, when they were seemingly average as this best-of-five series with the Texas Rangers began. Ordinary at the Rogers Centre. Explosive in Arlington. \nWhat, if anything, does any of that mean for Game 5 today? \nIt is, like so much of this story, impossible to predict with any certainty. When Alex Anthopoulos traded for David Price, he did so with the full intention of treating an ace like an ace. That was uplifting. The first Jays pitcher to be truly a difference-maker since Roy Halladay. He smiled when he talked about Price. Gibbons spoke often spoke about the difference he made. Throughout the tight series in August and September, Price did everything he was supposed to do. He made all the right starts, won almost all the right games. He walked on that rarified kind of air few ever find themselves parading. \nBut then the worst of all possible scenarios occurred for Price, who talks always about not making excuses, just pitching better. The Blue Jays drew the major-league team that gives him the most trouble. His start in Game 1 was anything but ace-like. And when it came down to utilizing Price either in the bullpen in Game 4 or as the starter in Game 5, the Blue Jays made the kind of move that makes sense on paper, but not necessarily in the way baseball usually operates. \nThe 10 innings pitched against the Rangers in this series, with eight earned-runs given up, a 7.20 earned-run average, makes the decision of management all the easier to live with. The best chance the Jays have to win on Wednesday afternoon is with Stroman starting: As crazy a story as that is, that is a longer long shot than this season has been. \nJust not anymore. Not today. This is the start of a lifetime for Marcus Stroman, the game of a lifetime for those of us not old enough to have seen Joe touch ’em all. \nA Toronto day for history. What kind of history, we don’t know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:26:49.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
