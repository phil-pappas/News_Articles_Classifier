Holmes reacts on the first hole during the first day of the Presidents Cup at Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea. (Photo: Jeon Heon-Kyun, EPA)\n28 CONNECT 66 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE INCHEON CITY, South Korea — So much for all the changes.\nThe U.S. once again built up a big lead in the Presidents Cup, dominating Thursday’s first session by winning four of five Foursomes matches. The Americans, whose 8-1-1 domination in the Cup forced a reduction in matches from 34 to 30 and other alterations in hopes of making the competition more competitive, only trailed in the one match they lost.\nUSA TODAY\nPresidents Cup changes aim to restore drama to U.S.-dominated matches\nRickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker set the tone with a 5-and-4 rout of Anirban Lahiri and Thongchai Jaidee to put the first red, white and blue point on the board at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea. Fowler and Walker never trailed, grabbing the lead on the second hole and steadily extending it as Fowler made putts from all over the place. The two have not lost a match as a team; in the 2014 Ryder Cup, Fowler and Walker halved all four of their matches.\n“It was nice to see some red on the board,” Fowler said. “We saw we were leading some of the matches early, so it's fun to feed off of that, and at the same time to try and put your name up there and show the guys that you're tagging along and doing the same thing.”\nThen Southern smashers Bubba Watson and J.B. Holmes made it 2-0 with a 3-and-2 thumping of Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama, one of the Internationals strongest squad. Point No. 3 came from the dynamic duo of world No. 1 Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson, who disposed of Marc Leishman and Danny Lee, 4 and 3.\nPhil Mickelson and Zach Johnson finished the 4-1 day when world No. 2 Jason Day conceded the 18th hole when his eagle putt didn’t drop in the 2-up defeat with Steven Bowditch. Mickelson holed a bunker shot from 20 yards on the 13th hole to increase the team’s lead to 2-up and then set up the final hole concession with a 327-yard drive, from which Johnson knocked his shot to 8 feet. Mickelson has played in every Presidents Cup and is 21-16-11.\nThe only point for the Internationals came from Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace, who defeated Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed, 3 and 2.\nUSA TODAY\nHitting straight a must for Jack Nicklaus-designed Presidents Cup course\nThe U.S. has not lost a session in team play since 2007.\n“It's the first day, and you don't know what's going to happen but you definitely want to go out there and try to put the pedal to the floor,” Walker said. “We felt good. … Key was Rickie made some great putts. Starting out of the gate, I ran one by a bit too far on the first hole, and he buries it. And I hit a couple really good iron shots for him and he just kept burying them and burying them.”\nHolmes was a last-minute replacement for the injured Jim Furyk but made an impact in the first match with Watson.\n“Well, if you look at us, we're awesome looking, first of all. But if you look at it, we play the same game,” Watson said. “We hit a driver pretty well, we can find the fairways, and we hit long irons pretty well. We chip and putt pretty good. And J.B. putted really good. That's why I picked him as a partner, because I knew he was going to putt unbelievable the last few weeks.\n“It was fun.”\nIt certainly wasn’t fun for the Internationals, who come from countries not eligible for the European side in the Ryder Cup.. History in this event isn’t on their side, and good play wasn’t on their side to start the 2015 Cup. Their backs are against the wall – but the wall is still a ways from them.\n“Obviously we knew coming in, the Americans are a great side. They are stronger than us on paper, and a lot of them are in great form,” Oosthuizen said. “We need to play better. We today slacked a little bit, but there's four sessions left. You know, we can turn this thing around (Friday).\n“Yes, we have the history not in our favor, but that's why we play. We play to change that and we are playing for that trophy at the end of Sunday.”\nInternationals captain Nick Price pushed for the changes for the Presidents Cup and expected a close contest this time around. So far his team hasn’t risen to expectations.\n“Obviously today was a really tough day for us,” Price said. “I think some of the guys on the team were a little nervous, which is to be expected. But we take our hats off to the U.S. team. They played really well today. There were a lot of birdies made out there. Hit a lot of great shots, made a lot of putts. So a tough day for us.\n“Having said that, we are only five points into 30. We still have another 25 points left out there. So we've got a long way to go, and that's what I told my team. I said, ‘Don't worry about where we stand right now. There's still, as I say, a long way to go.’ Just to keep their chins up and do the best they can.”\nThe competition ends Sunday.\nPHOTOS: Best photos from the 2015 Presidents Cup\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Best photos from the 2015 Presidents Cup Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
