Comment   By staff reports Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:39 PM Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:39 PM Local libraries aren’t just for checking out books. Through a partnership with the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC), fishing is more accessible via the Neosho/Newton County Library branch in Neosho and the McDonald County Library in Pineville through MDC’s Rod and Reel Loaner Program. Through the program, which is available in select communities throughout the state, individuals can check out fishing poles and tackle boxes for free at participating sites. Fishing poles are equipped with standard spin-cast reels. Tackle boxes are supplied with hooks, sinkers and bobbers for basic fishing opportunities. People need to bring live bait or desired lures to bait the hook. The program is part of MDC’s Angler Recruitment and Retention Plan, a strategic plan designed to increase angler participation across the state by offering angling education courses to the public, increasing awareness of Missouri’s aquatic resources and increasing fishing opportunities for citizens. To learn more about the program, contact the Neosho library at 451-4231 or the Pineville library at 223-4489 for information on check-out procedures and rules specific to that location.
