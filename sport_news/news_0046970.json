(AP) - Doug Martin ran for 123 yards and scored three touchdowns Sunday, helping Jameis Winston rebound from his worst pro performance and lead the Buccaneers to a 38-31 victory over the mistake-prone Jaguars. The Bucs (2-3) snapped an 11-game home losing streak that dated to December 2013, the same month the Jaguars (1-4) began an equally agonizing road skid that now stands at 12. Winston threw for 209 yards and one touchdown without an interception, redeeming himself after turning the ball over five times in a 14-point loss to Carolina last week. Blake Bortles passed for 303 yards and four TDs, but also threw an interception that set up a Bucs touchdown. The Jaguars gave up a 58-yard punt return that led to Martin's 10-yard TD reception, and rookie Corey Grant lost a third-quarter fumble that defensive end Jacquies Smith returned 3 yards for a score that put Tampa Bay ahead for good. ___ AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
