The host Mariners and visiting Mustangs played to a scoreless, double-overtime tie. In the background is Mustang Ryleigh Lord, middle. \nThomaston — Typically when a team fails to register a shot on goal, it does not yield positive results. \nThe exception to the rule might well be the Mount View girls soccer team, which traveled to face top-ranked, unbeaten Oceanside on Friday afternoon, Oct. 16 on Sam Pendleton Field. \nThe Mustang defense hung tough through the two 40-minute halves, in addition to two five-minute overtimes, to stave off the Mariners and settle for a scoreless tie in high school pitch play. \nA link for more photos from this game will appear later with this story. \nSee more photos below. \nIt was the second stalemate of the season for the still undefeated Mariners, who will end their regular season on Monday, Oct. 19 against Belfast in Rockland. \nFor the ‘Stangs, it was their third draw. Mount View will end the regular season on Monday, Oct. 19 at Nokomis of Newport. \nThe Mariners and Mustangs are playoff-bound, as Oceanside looks to cap an unbeaten campaign and the top spot in the region, while Mount View will realize its postseason dreams for the first time in 10 years. \nThe Mustangs gained a boatload of valuable Heal Points with Friday's stalemate. The tie pushed Mount View from 10th to ninth. \nOn Friday, Mount View's defense stood tall against the mighty, talented, deep Mariners and fended off 19 Oceanside shots, while the Mustangs could not muster a shot on frame against the hosts. \nJenni Nadeau made 19 saves in goal for the ‘Stangs, while Kayln Grover minded the net for the Mariners. \nOceanside finished with a 7-0 advantage in corner kicks and 9-5 edge in direct kicks. \nThe Mariners will compete in the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference Class B championship game on Wednesday, Oct. 21 against Waterville (11-1-2) at Lincoln Academy of Newcastle. The game is set for 7 p.m. \nThe Mariners and Purple Panthers played to a 2-2 tie earlier in the regular season. \nIn the Maine Principals’ Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Oceanside (11-0-2, 155.5867 points) is first, while Mount View (5-5-3, 63.4949 points) is ninth in the 18-team region. The top 12 teams qualify for the playoffs. Oceanside's Hope Butler, right, and Mount View's Kristen Ravin. At right is Mustang Brittany Dugal.
