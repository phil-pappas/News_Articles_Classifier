Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) announced on Wednesday that two more pitchers from the Giants had bet on professional baseball games. The announcement follows revelations two weeks ago that Giants pitcher Satoshi Fukuda had bet on games involving his team as well as Major League Baseball. Fukuda did not appear for the top team this season, so there is no suspicion that he fixed games, but gambling is a violation of NPB's charter.
