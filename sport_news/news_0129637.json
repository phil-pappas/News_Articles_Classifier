The rules were in place as they were, so at that point it was just really we had a break from Toulon. \n“I’m massively more appreciative of it all now that I’m back with Australia. I suppose I am more grateful than I was. \n“When you’re playing consistently I think you take it for granted – it’s a shocking thing to take it for granted, playing for your country. \n“But now that I’ve been given a second chance… little things like getting your kit again make you feel 19 like when it all started. I certainly take nothing for granted now.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:51:18.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
