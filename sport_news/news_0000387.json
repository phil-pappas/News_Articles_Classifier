At the time, it was the preposterous notion of the Cubs winning the 2015 World Series. Doesn’t seem all that crazy now. For their part, the Toronto Blue Jays don’t need art imitating life. They just need life to recycle in reverse.\nIn 1985, the Blue Jays opened the American League Championship Series at home against Kansas City and won the first two games – but dropped the series in seven.\nThirty years later, the teams are meeting again and it’s the Royals who jumped to a 2-0 lead at home.\nNow it’s the Blue Jays’ turn to try for a big comeback of their own.\nThe teams are back in Toronto and play Monday night (8 p.m., FS1) in Rogers Centre, with Marcus Stroman pitching for the Blue Jays against Kansas City’s Johnny Cueto.\nIn 1985, the Blue Jays had a 5-2 lead in Game Three but frittered it away in a 6-5 loss as George Brett pounded two home runs and scored the winning run in the eighth on a Steve Balboni single. The Royals’ top offensive threat got their bats going at home. And that’s exactly what the Blue Jays need to do now.\nWhile so much of the talk in the aftermath of Saturday’s Game Two collapse is centered on the pop up that fell between second baseman Ryan Goins and right fielder Jose Bautista, the bottom line to the Blue Jays’ hole in this series is their offense.\nBaseball’s highest-scoring team is batting just .197 in the first two games and a putrid .130 with runners in scoring position – just 3 hits in 23 at-bats with nine runners left on base in each game.\nThe Royals, meanwhile, have been lethal in RISP situations by going 8 for 20 in the first two games.\nToronto’s big bats have been mostly silent thus far, with no home runs in the two games. Presumptive MVP Josh Donaldson and Troy Tulowitzki are 2-8, Bautista is 0 for 5, Edwin Encarnacion is 2 for 7. Leadoff man Ben Revere has set no tables in going 0 for 9.\nThis is a pattern that started in the division series against Texas and hasn’t really been solved. The Blue Jays led the AL during the regular season by batting .286 in RISP at-bats – and are at just .191 in this postseason.\nPerhaps it should have been no surprise. You can’t be expected to bludgeon opponents in October like you do during the regular season. You’re seeing everyone’s top starters and teams at this level have deep bullpens.\nBut coming home, where they were 53-28 in the regular season, is the Blue Jays’ best hope at this point. In their own park, they led the AL in runs (450), slugging (.485) and OPS (.836) and were third in home runs (123). They scored just nine fewer runs on the road but their slugging (.431) and OPS (.760) were definitely lower on the road.\nIt’s Toronto’s first game back under the dome since their crazy Game Five win over Texas. And they will need a similar offensive breakout as they got in that one.\n“We’ve been doing that all year,” manager John Gibbons said after the Jays worked out Sunday. “In those first couple of games against Texas, they held us in check, and we broke in the games down here and scoring late to win the last game.\n“We hit home runs. We’re built for our park, we’re built for our division we play in and things like that. Really, that’s our trademark. If we’re going to win, we need to score.”\nFive runs is the Blue Jays’ magic number to reach. More so than most teams, it seems to be their line of demarcation.\nIn the regular season, they were 77-13 when they scored five or more and 16-56 when they didn’t. In the playoffs, it’s more of the same: The ledger reads 3-0 when they score five-plus and 0-4 when they don’t.\n“We know that this club is capable of getting on a run and putting together two or three or four wins in a row,” said Royals manager Ned Yost. “You have to keep your guard up. You’ve got to continue to stay focused and you’ve got to be able to stay on the attack. And it doesn’t matter if you’re home or you’re on the road.\n“That’s a good team that can put some runs up on the board in a hurry and smother you with offense. You’ve got to pitch well, aggressively. We’ve got to play good defense and do what we’ve been doing with the bats.”\nThe Royals have tough outs who make contact through their lineup and they’ve been murder on bullpens, batting .342 in the seventh inning or later in the postseason.\nThey’re on a four-game winning streak that started with their huge comeback in Game Four at Houston and reached its apex with Saturday’s five-run seventh that foiled the gem being thrown by Toronto ace David Price.\nThe Royals are feeling it. They have to be thinking about sweeping the ALCS for the second straight year, doing to the Jays what they did to Baltimore in 2014.\n“Every game is important,” Yost said. “To win the first game was huge. To come back to win the second game was even bigger. But our focus again, and I know it’s so boring, it’s just day to day. We celebrated, that was a big win for us. But that’s over.”\nThe Blue Jays certainly expect big things on the mound from Stroman, the medical marvel who has come back from March knee surgery that had initially ruled him out for the season. He gave them six good innings in Game Five against Texas but needed the offense to bail him out.\n“This team is a great team to face adversity with because of the camaraderie and the confidence in every single guy in the clubhouse,” Stroman said Sunday. “We don’t get down. We might get down in the series, but you could never tell if you walked in our clubhouse. We keep an upbeat, very positive nature, and we know we’re capable of getting the job done.”\nemail: mharrington@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:27:14.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
