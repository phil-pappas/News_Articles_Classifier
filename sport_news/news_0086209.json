The Minutemen punted on two of its last three possessions, and Frohnapfel couldn’t connect with star receiver Tajae Sharpe on fourth-and-5 with 30 seconds left in the game.\n“I give Kent State a lot of credit,” UMass coach Mark Whipple said. “They did a nice job, and I didn’t have a very good plan. . . . I’ve got to do a better job.”\nThe UMass defense, which allowed 62 points to Bowling Green on the road last weekend, had its best game of the season — but the offense was shut out the entire second half.\n“They kind of responded from last week,” Frohnapfel said, referring to the defense. “In the locker room we were basically telling the guys: ‘Thanks for giving us the opportunity.’ They played their butts off.”\nLinebackers Jovan Santos-Knox and Shane Huber led the way for the defense. Santos-Knox, the unit’s emotional leader, had 17 tackles, and Huber added 10.\n“That’s our job, to have the offense’s back,” Santos-Knox said. “When times are tough for them and they’re struggling, we have to pick it up and make plays on defense. We didn’t make enough plays obviously. It’s on us.”\nThe Golden Flashes took a 13-10 lead with 9:14 left in the third quarter after Shane Hynes hit a 39-yard field goal.\nUMass and Kent State went into the half tied at 10-10 after both offenses sputtered out of the gates.\nThe Golden Flashes tied things up with 3:14 left in the half after an eight-play, 65-yard drive that was capped with a 1-yard touchdown pass from George Bollas to receiver Charles Chandler.\nNew Hampshire native Logan Laurent, who assumed kicking duties earlier this season, put the Minutemen ahead 10-3 with 7:31 left in the half on a 28-yard field goal. Sharpe broke Adrian Zullo’s school record for career receiving yards (2,892) on the drive.\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, UMass running back Jamal Wilson broke the ice with a 5-yard touchdown run. Laurent, who missed a 41-yard field goal low and to the left, hit the extra point to give the Minutemen a 7-0 lead with 14:13 left in the half.\nKent State settled for a Hynes field goal on the next drive after the UMass defense stiffened on its 5-yard line. Bollas (15 carries, 79 yards), a redshirt freshman for the Golden Flashes, led the offense on a series of quarterback keepers that went for big yardage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:31:55.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
