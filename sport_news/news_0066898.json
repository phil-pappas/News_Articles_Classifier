Allred and her law firm are representing Judy Huth in the lawsuit against Cosby.\nHuth is among 50 women who have accused Cosby of raping, molesting or abusing them during his years in the entertainment business. Cosby’s attorney has denied the allegations.\nWhat was said in the deposition will remain under seal at least until Dec. 22, when U.S. Superior Court Judge Craig D. Karlan will review the testimony. The judge then will hear attorneys’ arguments over what portions of the deposition will be made public.\n“We will also be seeking to take a further deposition of Mr. Cosby at a later date,” Allred said.\nHuth is due to be questioned in the case Oct. 15.\nHuth says that she and a friend were in San Marino’s Lacy Park in 1974 when they wandered over to a movie set where Cosby was working.\nAccording to the lawsuit, he approached the teens, invited them to sit in his director’s chair and asked how old they were. Cosby later invited the girls to his Los Angeles County tennis club the following Saturday.\nJudge refuses to throw out defamation suit against Cosby Tribune wire reports A defamation lawsuit brought against Bill Cosby by three women who say he sexually abused them decades ago can move forward, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled Friday, delivering a legal blow to the comedian as he attempts to defend himself against accusations of sexual assault by dozens of...\nA defamation lawsuit brought against Bill Cosby by three women who say he sexually abused them decades ago can move forward, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled Friday, delivering a legal blow to the comedian as he attempts to defend himself against accusations of sexual assault by dozens of...\n(Tribune wire reports) They met him there, the suit said, then followed him to a house, where he served them alcoholic beverages and played billiards with Huth, who was required to drink a beer every time Cosby won a game. Later, the girls followed Cosby to the Playboy Mansion, where the comedian told Huth and her friend to say they were 19 if anyone asked their ages.\nAt one point, Huth used a bathroom and emerged to find Cosby sitting on a bed, the suit said. The comedian asked the girl to sit down on the bed beside him and attempted to “put his hand down her pants.”\nHe then took her hand in his and performed a sexual act on himself “without her consent,” the suit said.\nHuth’s lawsuit, filed in December, is the first significant court case against Cosby since he was sued in 2005 by Andrea Constand, a Temple University employee. After being deposed in that case, Cosby settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.\nCosby’s attorneys contend that Huth once tried to sell her story to the National Enquirer and that it is “absolutely false.” They also say another lawyer for Huth tried to get up to $250,000 from Cosby.\nBill Cosby sex assault allegations Read more stories Another woman, Chloe Goins, sued Cosby in federal court this week, claiming she was molested by the comedian at the Playboy Mansion in 2008.
