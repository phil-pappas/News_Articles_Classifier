From the opening kickoff Friday, Constantine dominated its Southwestern Athletic Conference matchup with Fennville and celebrated homecoming with 55-0 win. The Falcons needed only three plays on their first possession to reach the end zone. After a penalty on the Blackhawks during the extra point, Constantine went for two, and went up 8-0. Constantine led 15-0 after one quarter, on scores from Spencer Tefft and Anthony Evilsizor. Trailing 36-0 midway through the second quarter, Fennville had its best scoring opportunity after a 75-yard kickoff return by Jordan Watkins put the ball inside the Falcons 15-yard line. But Constantine turned the Blackhawks away, and went on to build a 43-0 halftime lead. With a running clock, Constantine added a score in each of the third and fourth quarters. Matt Hasbrouck paced the Falcons with two scoring runs, one for 10 yards and the second for 58. Hasbrouck rushed for 135 yards. Tefft gained 98 yards on five carries with two scores, Eric Petoskey had 71 yards on the ground on five totes, Evilsizor gained 66 yards on six carries and two scores and Daniel Waterman added 52 yards and a score on one carry.
