Chris Perkins Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Dolphins' locker room, offense and defense changing under Campbell \nAlthough change was evident when the Dolphins returned to work from their bye week on Monday there was no dominant emotion or prevalent feeling. \nAs players prepared for their second practice under interim coach Dan Campbell, some said it felt like a brand new season, others said it felt like a fresh start, and the rest were simply open-minded and optimistic. \n\"I don't know what to expect,\" defensive end Derrick Shelby said. \"Hopefully it's good things.\" \nCampbell, the former tight ends coach who was given the top job a week ago after Joe Philbin was fired, said there would be \"tweaks\" in personnel, the offense and defense when the Dolphins (1-3) visit Tennessee (1-3) on Sunday. \n\"There might be some things in there that are designed to help our offensive line a little bit more as far as to get going a little bit early, which if they get going early, then you're only helping your quarterback out,\" Campbell said.

Possibly mixed-down type stuff, whether it's a technique or those things, what we're doing coverage wise and what it's going to look like.\" \nCampbell, who said he doesn't expect the personnel tweaks to be \"significant,\" expects the offensive and defensive tweaks to be evident against the Titans. \n\"With the guys we've got, absolutely,\" he said. \nIn keeping with the \"tweaks\" theme, many players, mostly youngsters or newcomers to the team, had their lockers relocated. Dolphins DE Olivier Vernon knows defense can play better \nMiami Dolphins DE Olivier Vernon says team needs to figure out why they are giving up so many rushing yards on defense. \nMiami Dolphins DE Olivier Vernon says team needs to figure out why they are giving up so many rushing yards on defense.

Or putting together a coaching staff that consists of an offensive coordinator, a defensive coordinator, an assistant head coach, and two senior offensive assistants. \nThe idea behind re-arranging the locker room, according to Campbell, is to put the different units together (defensive linemen are in a section, offensive linemen have their section, running backs have their section, etc). \nPreviously, the locker room was fairly random. \nUnder the new plan, right tackle Ja'Wuan James moved halfway across the locker room. Left guard Dallas Thomas basically moved around the corner. Rookie right guard Jamil Douglas moved to the opposite side of the locker room. \nNo one seemed to mind. \n\"This is what I'm honestly used to,\" said James, now in his second season. \"In college it was like that, so I'm fine with it. It's good to see them.\" \nMany veterans didn't move â€” quarterback Ryan Tannehill, left tackle Branden Albert, center Mike Pouncey, cornerback Brent Grimes, strong safety Reshad Jones, among them. \nThe most notable players to stay put were defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh and defensive end Cameron Wake, who still have an entire row of lockers to themselves. The rest of the defensive line moved in around them. \n\"For those guys, it stays the same,\" Campbell said, \"which is good.\" \nAs for on-the-field happenings, Campbell, who said last week he wanted his players to \"violently compete,\" seemed pleased with Monday's practice. \nUnlike Wednesday's first practice under Campbell, there were no 1-on-1 drills Monday, and there were no scuffles. \n\"Guys came out and competed,\" he said. \"That's exactly what we wanted, that's what we were looking for.\" \nCampbell, who played 11 seasons in the NFL, preaches player responsibility more than coach responsibility. \n\"Every coach wants to make the perfect call, they do,\" he said, \"but the bottom line is this: If all 11 guys are on the same page and you have the wrong call, you can still succeed if you have the right animals, and we do.\" \nCampbell, a first-time head coach, said he's reached out to a number of mentors and former coaching mates to pick their brains on being in charge. He said his takeaway was simple. \n\"There's two things,\" he said. \"They all say that it's the same thing: number one, be yourself, and [number two], change it up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:49:13.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
