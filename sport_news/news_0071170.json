She’s her own toughest critic. She needs to kind of give herself a break and realize she does a great job, just have fun and go.” \nWhen going over Plumb’s family tree, you can begin to understand where she got some of those traits. \nBoth of Plumb’s grandfathers coached in the NFL. \nHer paternal grandfather, Ted, was an assistant coach for seven teams over a 27-year span, which included winning Super Bowl XX with the 1985 Chicago Bears. \nHer maternal grandfather, Fritz Shurmur, was an assistant coach for five teams in 23 years in the NFL. Shurmur was the defensive coordinator of the Green Bay Packers from 1994 to 1998, serving as the architect of the defense that helped the team win Super Bowl XXXI. \nPlumb’s parents, John and Susie, met in 1991 when their fathers were on the Phoenix Cardinals' coaching staff. \nHattie Plumb was about a month old when her parents took her to San Diego for Super Bowl XXXII between the Packers and Denver Broncos in 1998. \n“We have a ton of pictures of me in my grandpa’s arms and everything,” Plumb said of Shurmur, who died in 1999. “It’s just a cool experience to look back on.” \nWhen it comes to running, Plumb has always looked to emulate her mom, who ran college track and cross-country at the University of Wyoming. \n“I just wanted to be like her, so she entered me in a bunch of 5K races, and I just fell in love with it, said Plumb, who was a three-event state track qualifier last season as a junior. \n“The feeling of running, I can’t even describe it because it’s a love-hate relationship. But I’ve been sticking with it through my whole life and it has made me who I am. I can’t imagine my life without it.” Buy Photo \nBay Port's Savannah Huben, second from right, and Hattie Plumb, right, take the lead while competing in last week's Fox River Classic Conference meet at Colburn Park in Green Bay.

She has helped the 3,200 and 1,600 relays break school records. \nOne of Plumb’s goals for her senior track season is to break the school record of 5 minutes, 6.74 seconds in the mile. She wants to do so mainly because her mom’s best time was 5:07. \nPlumb’s ability and red hair sometimes make others mistake her for former Green Bay Notre Dame standout Allie Woodward, who won the D2 state cross-country title in 2010. \n“My mom was biking with me and pushing my pace on my run the other day,” Plumb said. “We passed a mom and two girls on their bikes. She was like, ‘Are you Allie Woodward?’ I’m like, ‘No, I’m Hattie Plumb. I’m from Bay Port,’ as I was running by. It was just funny.” \nPlumb has two younger brothers, Jack and Sam. Jack, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, is no joke on the basketball court, having already received NCAA Division I basketball scholarship offers from UW-Green Bay and UW-Milwaukee. \nThe family has a set of four season tickets for Packers games from Plumb’s maternal grandmother, Peggy, whose only request is that the family membernot going watches the game on TV with her. \n“It’s just a tradition that we’ve always been doing,” Plumb said. \nPlumb was disappointed when the Bay Port girls cross-country team’s streak of eight straight state appearances ended in 2013. She was battling iron deficiency that season. \nThe senior captain feels her team is capable of qualifying for state for a second consecutive year on Saturday. \nThe emergence of sophomore Savannah Huben, who placed third at last week's Fox River Classic Conference meet, should help the Pirates contend in a tough sectional. It features Green Bay East, the Bay Conference champion, and Kimberly, which is ranked No. 7 in D1. \n“I definitely think we have the potential to make it there,” said Plumb, who aspires to be an elementary teacher and work with children with autism. “Savannah is right where she needs to be. All of us girls just need to step it up a little bit. \n“We just need to push it as a team. I know we can. We have the potential. It’s right there. We just need to perform on that day.” \nJameson said he can see Plumb following in her grandfathers’ footsteps as a coach some day. But he feels her best running days are ahead. \n“It’s fun to see her grow as a leader and get more confident,\" Jameson said. \"I think some of her best running is still a few years from now when she starts cranking it up at some college.” \napekarek@pressgazettemedia.com and follow him on Twitter @andrewpekarek. 6 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1RUu3mg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:10:04.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
