She printed out only about half of the names on the petition to present to the Ashbury Home Association at its meeting. The effort has attracted heavy media attention after the situation was reported by The Naperville Sun and at least three television news crews showed up at the association meeting. No media were allowed into the meeting.\nThe homeowners board voted Sept. 21 to curb the amount decorations homeowners in the neighborhood can put up so that only 50 percent of the yard is covered, excluding lights. The ruling also limits the time decor can be displayed to 30 days before and after a holiday.\nThe Halloween display at a home in south Naperville has attracted national attention for the dozens of ghosts, goblins and skeletons in the front yard and its dazzling light show set to music.\nSara said she was happy homeowners association board allowed her to speak. Sara, her parents and siblings were the only people who were not residents of the subdivision allowed to attend the meeting.\n\"It was very fast,\" Sara said of her visit. \"I read them my letter, and they said thank you,\" she said. \"I gave them the petition and my email. They said thank you for coming.\"\nSara and her family left after she read her letter and presented the petition.\nThe directive from the homeowners group was in response from neighbors' complaints that Thomas' extensive Halloween decorations in the 1100 block of Conan Doyle caused \"constant noise\" and traffic tie-ups. For the past 18 years, Thomas embellished his home with an elaborate display of more than 2,000 pieces and a light show synchronized to music. He estimated about 8,000 people visited last year alone, and Thomas doled out about 600 bags of candy on Halloween. Thomas also asks for donations and passes the money to an area charity.\nIn her message to the homeowners association, Sara asked the board to reverse its decision. Visits to Thomas' home each year had become a tradition for the Marston family.\n\"People from all over come to see his display. I have a friend whose grandparents live in Indiana, and they come here every Halloween to visit and see his house. They were sad to hear that the house wasn't going to be decorated,\" Sara said in her letter to the board.\nPetition supporting Halloween house gets attention from around the world Jane Donahue An online petition created by a Naperville fifth-grader has logged more than 7,500 signatures from people all over the world supporting a well-known Halloween house that was canceled after a subdivision homeowner's association tightened rules on holiday decorations.\n\"This means that a lot of people...\nAn online petition created by a Naperville fifth-grader has logged more than 7,500 signatures from people all over the world supporting a well-known Halloween house that was canceled after a subdivision homeowner's association tightened rules on holiday decorations.\n\"This means that a lot of people...\n(Jane Donahue) \"I understand the display can cause lots of traffic and inconvenience (to) some people that live near his house,\" Sara went on to say. \"To help solve the problem, maybe the Naperville Police Department could help on heavy traffic days to keep people moving and not inconvenience neighbors. Or Mr. Thomas could limit the house his display is active.\"\nSara still plans a march through the subdivision at 9 a.m. on Saturday to show support for Thomas' effort. She said her march will end at Thomas' home where she will present him with the latest petition signatures.\nThomas said he was unable to attend Monday's meeting because of scheduling conflicts.\nsubaker@tribpub.com\nTwitter @SBakerSun1\nCopyright Â© 2015, Naperville Sun Halloween Haunted Houses (attractions)", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5622db73/turbine/ct-nvs-halloween-house-petition-st-1018-20151017", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56259904/turbine/ct-nvs-naperville-halloween-ashbury-petition-st-1021-20151019", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f2df4/turbine/chi-photos-naperville-haunted-house-20141016"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:25:56.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
