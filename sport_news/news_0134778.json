Photo: AP “Extra points used to be in-game practice,” Feely wrote on Twitter. “You didn’t have to worry about the result (it was a given), which allowed you to focus on your form and get grooved in during the game.\n“[They were] somewhat of a confidence-builder, like throwing a couple screen [passes] early for a QB,” Feely continued. “Now, the pressure is bigger for extra points than even [field goals] because there is zero room for error (100 percent success is demanded). The pressure intensifies, and it negatively impacts FG performance as well.”\nZach Hocker missed from 30 yards, off the left upright, at the end of regulation for the Saints (though that was rendered moot by Drew’ Brees 80-yard TD to C.J. Spiller in overtime).\nJaguars kicker Jason Myers failed twice to beat the Colts, missing a potential game-winning 53-yarder wide right with one second left in regulation and a 48-yarder in overtime of a 16-13 loss. Bucs rookie kicker Kyle Brindza missed field goals of 29 and 43 yards.\nOf course, not everyone is afflicted. The Chiefs’ Cairo Santos nailed a franchise-record seven field goals in Kansas City’s 36-21 loss to the Bengals on Sunday, and the Ravens’ Justin Tucker, Adam Vinatieri (a.k.a Mr. Clutch) of the Colts and the Bears’ Robbie Gould all nailed tries from 50-plus yards in close wins.\nBut if the owners’ goal was to put some mystery back into the kicking experience (and it was), then they’ve already succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.\nAdditional reporting by Steve Serby \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under adam vinatieri ,  jacksonville jaguars ,  new orleans saints ,  nfl ,  pittsburgh steelers ,  tampa bay buccaneers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:34:19.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
