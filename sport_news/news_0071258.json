That was good stuff there.” Stewart threw for three scores and added another on a 42-yard run as the Sturgis offense overcame a slow start to methodically put away the Tigers. The senior quarterback concluded the game 12-for-24 for 228 yards and added 39 yards on the ground. The Trojans were run-heavy early in the game and struggled at times. “A lot of of things were one and done or big plays (in the first half),”Lamb said.“We were trying this week to run our offense, scheme with different tailbacks. We need to evaluate that film and see. Because that’s what we want to do, come in and run the ball. We had our moments, we’ve got some things we have to fix.” One of the first big plays was a 42-yard touchdown hook-up between Stewart and Liam Adams. Stewart hit Adams as he cut inside about 15 yards downfield and the senior receiver made the safety miss and raced the distance for the touchdown. The point after was wide left leaving the score 6-0, where it remained after one quarter. Stewart used his feet for the next score early in the second quarter.After pulling the ball out of the tailback’s belly, he raced around the end and down the sideline for the 42-yard score. Tyler Cain added the two-point run to push the score to 14-0. It stayed there until halftime. Lamb decided to pull a trick play to spark his squad. The Trojans opened the second half with an onsides-kick, which was recovered by Sturgis’ Lane Schlautmann. “We’ve been practicing that all week,”Lamb said. “Yesterday we didn’t have any good ones, but Rodrigo (Garcia) nailed it today. They weren’t ready for it, so it was a perfect call. “Sometimes they work.” The offense pounded it down the field with the rushing attack as Cole Campbell, who finished the contest with 17 handles for 83 yards, ran six straight times to get the Trojans to a first-and-goal. However, three negative plays forced Sturgis to go for it on fourth down. Stewart, who had missed connecting with his brother Brecken a few plays earlier, this time hit him for a 9-yard touchdown “It got us going,”Lamb said of the recovery. “It got us thinking, we’re moving forward. We drove it down there and had to go fourth-and-9 and we scored on the slant pass.” Page 2 of 2 - Garcia added the extra point for a 21-0 lead with 7:44 to go in the third quarter. After the Trojan defense forced a turnover on downs near midfield early in the fourth quarter, TristenStewart tossed his third touchdown of the night.Exploiting the same area as the earlier two scoring tosses, this time he faked the handoff, then connected with senior Jordan Myers, who raced for the 46-yard touchdown. “That’s big for that young man,”Lamb said. “After last week, you know, he had a concussion at the Vicksburg game.He went through all week and we finally got him to stage five. And I was debating whether to play him or not. He’s a senior and I thought if I was a senior, if I was healthy, I’d want coach to play me. We called a run-pass option, and his hands caught it and he took it to the house. Congratulations to that young man.” The defense gave the Trojans their final score as Cain picked off a pass and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown. Brandon Wetzel and Adams also had interceptions for Sturgis. “We were still off a little bit and ultimately that stuff going to fix, because we have to go in to Dowagiac and take care of that,”Lamb said of the offense. Adams caught four passes for 82 yards,Brecken Stewart added three for 66 yards and Salvador Mangandi and Wetzel each had two receptions. The Trojans had 365 yards in total offense, while limiting the Tigers to 157 yards. Defensively, Cain led with seven-and-a-half tackles, Garcia collected six-and-a-half, Keylin Marker added four-and-a-half with a sack andCampbell had three-and-a-half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:43:00.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
