He had 91 in 153 games for the Marlins this year but batted a career-low .229, dropping his career average to .314. \nHis slugging percentage this year was .279, the lowest among all major-league players with more than 300 at-bats. But injuries to other outfielders — including slugger Giancarlo Stanton — made him an everyday player. \nSuzuki, a 10-time Gold Glove Award winner, pitched for the first time in his 15-year major-league career in the Marlins' season finale Sunday, throwing one inning at Philadelphia. \nSuzuki's new deal was announced Tuesday. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:37:20.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
