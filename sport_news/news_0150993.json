Pleasant News \nThe Mt. Pleasant freshman football team is on a three game winning streak after defeating Chariton and Davenport Assumption last week. The Panthers shut out the Chargers, 35-0, in a makeup game last Monday before holding off Assumption, 26-13 on Friday. \nAgainst Chariton, a defense led by James Demeyer, Jacob Wallace and Rhett Zeglen was able to stop the Chargers on every drive. The defense scored once and helped set up four offensive scores in the game. \nMt. Pleasant scored all of its points in the first half, starting things off with a 15-yard run by Avonte Henley. Later in the half, Chase Lamm and Levi Puig each caught passes of 24-yards and 28-yards respectively from quarterback Zach Beason to make it 21-0. \nDemeyer helped break the game open with a 74-yard fumble return for a touchdown that turned a promising situation for Chariton into seven points for Mt. Pleasant. Puig scored his second touchdown of the game on a 21-yard run and the score was 35-0 at halftime, where it would stay. \nIn the Assumption game on Friday, Beason was dealing all night, going 8-12 for 235 yards and three touchdowns. The first of which was to Zeglen for 12 yards to make it 7-0 Panthers, and the second was to Chase Lamm for 33 yards to make the score 14-0. \nThe Knights were able to score once before halftime to bring the score to 14-7 and once in the second half to cut the lead to 14-13, but the defense led by Beason, Bryce Anderson, Hunter Faul and Tate Shull didn’t give any more points up all night. \nWith the score at 14-13, Beason found Puig for a 23-yard touchdown pass, but the two-point conversion attempt failed. Henley put the final nail in the coffin, though, with a three-yard touchdown run to make it 26-13. \nLamm had a huge game receiving against Assumption, catching five passes for 190 yards. Kicker David Blancas was a perfect 7-7 on extra point attempts in the week’s games. \nThe freshman Panthers moved to 4-1 with the win and 2-0 in the district. They play at Clear Creek-Amana this Friday, Oct. 2, at 5 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:31:21.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
