Before the move, though came a one-sided Oakland win.\n\"Not much to say after a game like this,\" San Diego coach Mike McCoy said. \"Nothing good happened after the first play.\"\nWhile McCoy called his team's play \"pathetic\" during a third consecutive loss, the second-place Raiders gave notice: They are no longer a pushover.\n\"It's great to come in here and get a road win within the division,\" Oakland coach Jack Del Rio said. \"I thought really the first three quarters of the game were very strong efforts in all three phases. That's the longest we have sustained really good football.\"\nOakland handed San Diego its fifth AFC West loss in seven games.\n\"Coach Del Rio stresses just do your job,\" Carr said. \"Don't do anything outside yourself, and I though that's what we did, and it's reassuring.\"\nWATCH: Raiders-Chargers highlights\nThe Raiders were keen from the get-go, racing to a 30-6 halftime lead as they dominated all three phases of the game.\nThey scored on their first seven drives and kept the Chargers from the end zone until the fourth quarter.\n\"It was sickening how fast it happened,\" San Diego quarterback Philip Rivers said.\nThe Chargers lost their previous two games in the final seconds. That wasn't the case Sunday, as they were pushed around by Oakland before outscoring the Raiders 23-0 in the fourth quarter.\nRivers completed 38 of 58 passes for 336 yards and three touchdowns. He was intercepted twice, turnovers the Raiders converted into 10 points.\nCarr finished with 289 passing yards, connecting on 24 of 31 passes with no interceptions. Raiders rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper caught five passes for 133 yards and a touchdown.\nOakland started the third quarter eager to show the first 30 minutes weren't a fluke.\nWide receiver Michael Crabtree caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from Carr to begin the half, pushing the Raiders' advantage to 37-6.\nChargers running back Danny Woodhead had two scoring catches and tight end Ladarius Green added one in fourth quarter.\n\"It's not enough when you start like we did,\" Rivers said. \"We dug ourselves too deep of a hole to get out of.\"\nThe Raiders took control of the game with a 20-point second quarter.\nCarr hit tight end Clive Walford for a 23-yard touchdown two minutes into the quarter for a 17-3 lead.\nRivers then heaved his second interception -- after having none while throwing for 503 yards the previous week -- and again, the Raiders cashed in.\nThis time, kicker Sebastian Janikowski was good from 32 yards for a 20-3 Raiders edge.\nJanikowski delivered another field goal, this one from 31 yards, on Oakland's next possession, padding the cushion to 23-3.\nCooper showed his speed and wiggle on a 52-yard scoring strike from Carr. With numerous Chargers in pursuit, Cooper out ran most of them and then saved a cutback move that removed safety Jimmy Wilson from the equation. That put the Raiders ahead 30-3, and the Chargers clearly were getting embarrassed on both sides of the football.\n\"It was just perfect,\" Cooper said. \"When I caught the ball, I saw that I had a lot of room. I saw the guys coming and I just made some moves on them.\"\nSan Diego added kicker Josh Lambo's 44-yard field goal in the final seconds of the first half. When heading into the locker room, trailing by 24 points, the Chargers heard a barrage of boos.\nLambo's 40-yard, first-quarter field goal sliced the Chargers' deficit to 10-3.\nJanikowski kicked a 29-yard field goal with six minutes left in the first quarter for a 10-0 advantage.\nRunning back Latavius Murray rushed over from the 1-yard line for a 7-0 lead on Oakland's first possession. The Raiders got the ball on the first of Rivers' two interceptions.\nNOTES: Chargers FS Eric Weddle (groin) missed his first start since 2009. ... San Diego TE Antonio Gates (knee) was a late scratch. ... Chargers G Orlando Franklin sustained a knee injury in the fourth quarter and left on a cart. ... Raiders NT Stacy McGee started in place of Justin Ellis (ankle). ...
