Young, Detroit News) \nEast Lansing â€“ More often than not over the last couple of decades, the Michigan State-Michigan game has been for little more than bragging rights and the Paul Bunyan Trophy.\nBut anticipation and excitement has been ramped up to a fever pitch this season as the teams enter Saturday's showdown ranked among the best in the nation, with Michigan State standing at No. 7 and Michigan No. 12.\nIt's what makes a rivalry great, and many wonder why it hasn't been like this more often. This season's matchup could be the beginning of a long run of potential classics.\n\"Are you asking me if we can coexist?\" Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said when posed the question about whether both teams can be good at the same time. \"Families do that all the time. I guess we can do it.\"\nDETROIT NEWS\nMSU's LJ Scott gets acquainted with Michigan rivalry\nDantonio and the Spartans (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) enter the game dealing with multiple injuries, but true to his typical form, Dantonio wasn't shedding any light on the issue.\nAsked about the chances center Jack Allen, who injured his ankle last week against Rutgers, would play this week, Dantonio said, \"There always a chance.\"\nAllen is just one player whose status is unclear. Tackles Jack Conklin and tight end Josiah Price have missed the past two games, and offensive tackle Kodi Kieler returned last week but struggled. Running back Madre London also hurt his leg and cornerback Darian Hicks was knocked out of the game in first half.\nAll were on the depth chart released Tuesday, though that is no guarantee they will play on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:21:30.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
