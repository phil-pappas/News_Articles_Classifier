Not me, anyway.\nDepending the algorithm to which you’ve sworn your analytic allegiance, the Cubs seemed to be pegged for 83 or 84 wins, maybe 85 this year.\nSo, Maddon’s Cubs surprised the league. The Manager of the Year Award is always about surprises.\nAnd speaking of surprises, Maddon has done the impossible, or at least the unprecedented:\nReaching the playoffs with significant contributions from four rookie position players.\nIn a piece for Beyond the Boxscore, Scott Lindholm cited the use of Bryant, Kyle Schwarber, Jorge Soler and Addison Russell to validate Maddon as the only manager to orchestrate a playoff team under such circumstances.\nJon Lester yearns for more starts Mark Gonzales After reaching two milestones Wednesday, Jon Lester hoped that his 10-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds wasn't his final start off the 2015 season.\nLester marveled more over the maturity of the Cubs’ young players than his own distinction of pitching 200 innings for the seventh time in his career...\nAfter reaching two milestones Wednesday, Jon Lester hoped that his 10-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds wasn't his final start off the 2015 season.\nLester marveled more over the maturity of the Cubs’ young players than his own distinction of pitching 200 innings for the seventh time in his career...\n(Mark Gonzales) And when you include Javier Baez, Maddon’s game of toy soldiers evidences his ability to put young players in position to succeed when the players themselves might not know what’s good for them.\nForget the magician in the clubhouse, the petting zoo on the field and the onesies on the plane. What matters is how a team plays, and Maddon coaxed, demanded and worked his own magic to create a team that will play in the postseason for the first time since 2008.\nCardinals manager Mike Matheny deserves respect for managing the best team in baseball despite absences of Adam Wainwright, Matt Holliday, Matt Adams and Yadier Molina.\nPittsburgh’s Clint Hurdle also gets votes for challenging the Cardinals, but both teams were expected to reach the postseason.\nMets manager Terry Collins perhaps stands as Maddon’s closest competitor. The Mets won the NL East without any offense until Yoenis Cespedes was acquired.\nBut here’s the thing: For most of the season, the NL East had the two worst teams in the league while the Cubs reached the playoffs in a division topped by the two best teams in the majors.\nNot just the league. The majors.\nI’m not sure what other case needs to be made.\nWhich leads to this: Theo Epstein brought in and/or developed the plan to produce all that young talent. He also snagged the prospective Manager of the Year. He deserves an award himself.\nWe’re gonna need a bigger red carpet.\n Major League Baseball Joe Maddon Chicago Cubs MLB Manager of the Year Award Kris Bryant Jake Arrieta National League East", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d366a/turbine/ct-jon-lester-wants-another-start-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d3aaf/turbine/ct-cubs-maddon-manager-of-the-year-rosenbloom-20151001", "http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2015/8/10/9120763/chicago-cubs-trying-to-buck-history", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d35b5/turbine/ct-starlin-castro-dominates-september-20150930"], "published": "2015-10-01T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:56:10.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
