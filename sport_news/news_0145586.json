Scobee, the leading scorer in Jacksonville history, made just 6 of 10 field goals and also missed an extra point.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:33:31.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
