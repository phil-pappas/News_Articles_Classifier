But unlike Sunday, when they overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Utah Jazz, the Blazers didn't quite have enough magic to steal a victory on Monday. \nRyan Kelly's soaring dunk in the waning moments delivered the Los Angeles Lakers a dramatic 104-102 victory over the Blazers at the Staples Center. \nA mix of clutch plays by the Blazers and shaky execution by the Lakers created the late-game drama, allowing the Blazers to overcome a nine-point lead with less than a minute left to tie the game down the stretch. \nRobert Sacre made the most egregious errors for the Lakers, committing a costly turnover that led to a Omari Johnson layup with 27 seconds left and then committing a head-scratching foul on Pat Connaughton as he was attempting a three-pointer with 21 seconds left. \nConnaughton made all three free throws after he was fouled, trimming the Lakers' once-comfortable lead to 100-97. \nLater, Connaughton added to the drama and — momentarily — the Lakers' misery. After a Chris Kaman baseline jumper, the Lakers inbounded the ball underneath the basket. Kelly heaved the ball toward a teammate along the sideline and Blazers guard Phil Pressey charged to intercept the pass. As Pressey was flailing out of bounds, he snared the ball and tossed it toward the top of the perimeter. Pat Connaughton gave chase, scooped up the ball and launched a three that swished. \nStunningly, the game was tied 102-102 with 4.8 seconds left. \nBut the rally would fall short. \nOut of a timeout, Kelly caught a side inbounds pass on the perimeter and faked a handoff to Jabari Brown as sprinted by. After the fake, Kelly pivoted, charged through the heart of the Blazers' defense toward the hoop, and hammered home a monster dunk over Noah Vonleh with 2.0 seconds left. \nOn the other end, Vonleh missed a tough contested midrange jumper at the buzzer, and the Lakers escaped with a win. \nDamian Lillard led the Blazers with 20 points, six assists, three rebounds and one steal, but he played just 24 minutes after logging more than 40 on Sunday night. Moe Harkless had 15 points and five rebounds and Allen Crabbe added 10 points for the Blazers, who fell to 3-3 in the exhibition season. \nJordan Clarkson had 17 points, four rebounds and three assists for the Lakers, who improved to 3-4. \nAminu rests hamstring \nStarting small forward Al-Farouq Aminu did not play for the second consecutive game to rest his ailing left hamstring. The injury, a strain, is not considered serious. But with a regular season opener against the New Orleans Pelicans less than 10 days away, Aminu opted to rest rather than risk further injury. \nDavis faces former team \nEd Davis, who signed a three-year, $20 million free agent contract with the Blazers over the summer, faced his former team for the first time. Davis, who played for the Lakers for one season, finished with five points and two rebounds in 16 minutes. \nKobe Bryant sits \nLakers star shooting guard Kobe Bryant, who is entering his 20th NBA season, did not play against the Blazers with a bruised lower left leg. The one-time NBA MVP suffered the injury during the Lakers' exhibition loss to Sacramento last Tuesday in Las Vegas. He's played in five games during the preseason, averaging 13.0 points and shooting 44.6 percent from the field in 18.2 minutes per game. \nNext up \nThe Blazers play their final game of the exhibition season on Thursday night, when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers at 7:30 p.m. at the Staples Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:54:16.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
