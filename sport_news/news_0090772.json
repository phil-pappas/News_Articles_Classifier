It was his 323rd goal for Madrid, equaling Raul’s scoring record for the club. \nThe match wasn’t as lopsided as many had expected with a tough-tackling Malmo shutting down Madrid’s attack. Dani Carvajal’s shot in the 42nd hit both the crossbar and the post, leaving Madrid with a one-goal lead at half-time. \nMalmo chased an equalizer in the second half and captain Markus Rosenberg’s header narrowly missed the post in the 74th as Madrid started feeling the pressure. But the home side’s hopes dimmed four minutes later when left back Yoshimar Yotun was sent off for his second yellow card. \nWiland denied Ronaldo with two one-handed saves before the Portugal striker surged into the area and sealed the win for Madrid, which has six points after two games. \n“I think that to win away, to get three points, a clean sheet and two goals from Ronaldo, another record, so I have to be really pleased,” Real Madrid coach Rafael Benitez said. \nMadrid was missing Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, Sergio Ramos and Pepe due to injuries. Benitez also left Marcelo and Luka Modric out of the starting lineup, with an important league derby coming up this weekend against Atletico Madrid. \nMalmo coach Age Hareide praised his team’s performance, though they failed to create any clear chances besides Rosenberg’s attempt. \n“Our players worked very hard. As long as we kept our positions they didn’t create that much,” he said. “As long as it was 1-0 there was always a chance.” \nParis Saint-Germain also has six points from two games in Group A after beating Shakhtar Donetsk 3-0 on Wednesday. \nThe first showdown between the two group leaders follows on Oct. 21, with PSG hosting Madrid in the French capital. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:27:18.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
