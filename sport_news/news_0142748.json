As noted by BBC Sport, however, official statistics indicate he is actually still level with Raul on 323. \n\"The confusion centres around a goal scored in September 2010,\" the report states. \"The Spanish giants credit Ronaldo with a free-kick scored against Real Sociedad, despite the fact the effort was deflected in by team-mate Pepe, who was given the goal by La Liga.\" \nEither way, the record has been broken or is about to be, and to celebrate, Real have published a tribute video on YouTube showing off Ronaldo's greatest moments in a white shirt. \nThere were certainly many to choose from.
