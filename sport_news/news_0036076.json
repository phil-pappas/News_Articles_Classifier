Herman is retiring after 28 years as head coach of the Vineyarders at the conclusion of the season. MV (3-3) amassed 459 yards, 426 on the ground, and led 36-0 at the half. Five Vineyard seniors led the ground game, with Austin Chandler rumbling for 109 yards on 11 carries, including a touchdown, Ben Clark running for 72 yards on 10 carries and three scores, Jacob Cardoza adding 91 yards and a touchdown on seven carries, Curtis Farrell going for 87 yards and a touchdown on seven carries and Justin Donahue added 41 yards and a score on 10 carries. Clark ran in the first of his three touchdowns, a 1-yard dash, with a two-point conversion rush by junior James Sashin for a 8-0 lead after a quarter. Cardoza opened the second quarter with a 20-yard touchdown jaunt, followed by Clark’s second and third touchdown runs of two-yards and 20-yards, sandwiched around Chandler’s two-yard score, giving the hosts a 36-0 lead. Farrell and Donahue completed the Vineyarders scoring in the third quarter with touchdown runs of 2-yards and 1-yard, with Sashin adding the point-after-touchdown kick on five of the team’s seven touchdowns. Donahue added six tackles on defense for Martha’s Vineyard while junior Ennis Foster had an interception. Fairhaven 45, Bourne 0: For the first time since 2012 Fairhaven was able to shut out an opponent, winning 45-0 against Bourne at home in Fairhaven. Fairhaven’s field was in okay condition considering the inclement weather during the school day, and the Blue Devils crowd was in full attendance, and let Bourne know it once Tyler Mello forced a Bourne fumble on the first play from scrimmage of the game. While defense was huge, everything with Fairhaven started with the Noah Furtado. The senior running back finished the game with five touchdowns. His first was a 51-yard reception from his brother, Ian. The following three were rushing touchdowns, for 46, 3 and 49 yards. His final came on his second interception of the night, jumping a slant route. Noah ran it back 48 yards for his final score of the game in the middle of the third quarter. The crowd, announcer and everyone else were in awe of Noah’s performance—including his head coach, Rudy Bulgar. “I mean, he obviously looked like he was the best athlete on the field tonight,” Bulgar said. “We know he can run the ball and catch the ball.” Bulgar was particularly excited about Noah’s pick six because the coaching staff gambled, and it paid off. “Defensively, him jumping that slant route was a great scheme that coach (Jay) Furtado called.” Bulgar said. “We saw that they were calling out the blitzes and went to the check-down passes. We bluffed them and we told the safeties ‘when we bluff, they will try to get it out quick. Make sure you’re coming downhill.’ Just ask he was coached to do, he jumped in (and took it) to the house.” Noah was speechless about his performance. The senior could barely put together a sentence about his performance without cracking a smile and getting lost in the win. “It feels amazing (to score five touchdowns), I haven’t processed it yet,” Noah said. “The pick six was probably the most difficult.” One thing the running back made sure to mention was the win was not on his shoulders alone. “I couldn’t have done what I did without my whole team,” he said. “Especially Tyler Mello on those lead blocks and John Bulgar, they really helped me out there.” Along with his five touchdowns, Noah Furtado went on to run for 144 yards on 12 carries, along with his 51 yards in his lone reception. Furtado’s pick-six was a 48-yard return, and he returned his other interception for 25 yards. The Canalmen had some chances to get on the board, but the Blue Devils held strong all night, in large part because of Furtado. “We came out of the gates and took control,” Rudy Bulgar said. “We took the momentum from them right out of the gates and never gave it back.” Nick Friar Marshfield 36, Nauset 8: The top-ranked Rams scored all of their points in the opening half on the way to an Atlantic Coast League win over the Warriors in Marshfield. Jack Masterson threw for three touchdowns, the first to Danny Dalton for 35 yards. Marshfield added another TD followed by a safety to take a 16-0 lead in the first quarter. Monomoy forfeits game: According to the Monomoy Athletics twitter site, Friday night’s game against Cohasset was forfeited. The site stated that numerous injuries and player safety concerns went into the decision.
