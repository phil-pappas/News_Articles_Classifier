(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radios' Matt Jones shares his thoughts on the current UK football team. \nI'm Matt Jones and this is Overtime. \nAlright, let's say you're a UK football fan. How many times over the years have you said, “we almost beat somebody good?” \nWell, that happened again Thursday night against Auburn. \nKentucky was probably the better team in the second half. But in the first half, Auburn dominated the game, and got the 30-27 win. \nNow, I've heard a lot of Kentucky fans upset about the game and they said we had a chance at the end. If we had just made this play, or that play, we would have won. \nAnd that's true. \nBut we've been saying that for a long time. The difference this year is Kentucky is decidedly a mediocre SEC team and that's good. \nWe've been terrible for a number of years. Do you remember when Vanderbilt used to beat us 40-0? That was just four years ago. \nThis Kentucky team is competitive. And while they lost against Auburn, there are a lot of positive signs. The offense played well despite being very young. \nThe defense made big stops. They just didn't do enough to get the victory. \nI think it will come over time. But I admit, it's tough as a UK football fan, to continue to lose these games. \nYet I do believe this: Kentucky football's improving, and soon, these losses will become victories. \nI'm Matt Jones, and this has been overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:53:03.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
