Chris Ivory’s 9-yard touchdown reception, the culmination of a 13-play drive that took 7:03 off the clock, had given the Jets a one-point lead on the road against AFC rival New England. Was this new-look Jets team about to hang on and vault into a first-place tie with the Patriots? Nope. The Jets would increase the lead to four points after forcing a New England punt, but the offense left four points on the table. On third and seven from the Patriots’ 12-yard line early in the fourth quarter, Ryan Fitzpatrick threw to Brandon Marshall’s wrong shoulder. Despite a valiant twisting effort by Marshall, he couldn’t haul in the pass and the Jets had to settle for a field goal. It was a costly mistake. New England drove and scored a touchdown to take a three-point lead. The Jets went three-and-out on the ensuing drive. Facing fourth-and-seven at their own 46-yard line with 5:39 to go, the Jets elected to punt. Head coach Todd Bowles put his faith in his defense, hoping for another stop. He didn’t get it. Tom Brady marched the Patriots 68 yards on 10 plays over 4:19 crucial late-game minutes, capping the drive with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski. The Jets would kick a field goal and recover an onside kick, but the Patriots would hold on in the 30-23 win. Yet for most of the game, the Jets played brilliantly. Sure, there were some ugly spots, including a Fitzpatrick fumble on the second play of the game that put the Jets in an instant 3-0 hole. On the flip side, the defense kept the Patriots out of the end zone after the early turnover. The pass rush was effective in sacking Brady three times and the secondary didn’t get totally shredded by the Patriots’ aerial assault, although six dropped passes helped the Jets’ cause. As for the Jets’ offense, it was a solid if unspectacular effort. The running game never got going but an 8-of-14 performance on third downs helped the Jets to create long scoring drives that kept the Patriots’ offense off the field. This was the formula for beating the Patriots, so Bowles should be commended for going toe-to-toe with Bill Belichick in his first game against New England as a head coach. The problem is that the Jets still don’t exactly have the talent to match up with the Patriots on the field. The Jets are a few weeks shy of the halfway point of the season. To finish the season with nine or ten wins seems a realistic goal and if the Jets reach that, one of the two AFC wild-card spots could be theirs. For a team that faced serious quarterback issues and a learning curve for a first-year head coach, reaching the postseason would be a great start to a new era of Jets' football. But first place in the AFC East? The Jets showed on Sunday that they aren’t there quite yet.
