What they saw was an up-tempo attack on both ends of the floor. \"Overall pretty pleased,\" coach Matt McCall said. \"I thought all of the veterans gave us what we expected. Some of the new guys showed as well. I thought Burroughs (Cook) got his speed into the game which is something we harp at him about. \"I thought we did a decent job taking care of the basketball and we blocked out and rebounded better than we have in practice.\" It was a controlled scrimmage with players playing 10-minute quarters, mixing and matching between teams. Here are a few of the standout numbers: Senior Casey Jones : 27 pts, 7 reb, 4 ast, 3 stl, 11-15 FG, 4-6 3pt, 1-1 FTJunior Justin Tuoyo : 18 pts, 5 reb, 2 ast, 3 blk, 2 stl, 8-15 FG, 0-1 3pt, 2-3 FTJunior Greg Pryor : 19 pts, 4 reb, 1 blk, 1 stl, did not miss a shot inside 3pt range (7-7). 7-13 FG, 0-6 3pt, 5-7 FTJunior Tre' McLean : 10 pts, 11 reb (10 def), 4 ast, 4-11 FG, 2-3 3ptJunior Chuck Ester : 11 pts, 12 reb (11 def), 4 ast, 3-6 FG, 5-7 FTJunior Johnathan Burroughs-Cook : 18 pts, 5-7 FG, 3-5 3pt, 7-9 FT According to Jones, not only was it great to be back on the court in game-like situations, the support was there as well. \"I was surprised to see so many people out here,\" he shared. \"I thought we'd have many 10-20 fans, so it was good to see so many people out here (on a Sunday afternoon). I saw students…athletes…faces I see at our games, so there was good support which we really appreciate.\" The Mocs host Covenant in an exhibition game on Friday, Nov. 6.
