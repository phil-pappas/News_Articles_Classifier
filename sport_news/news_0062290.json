Jordan Graham scores in the pre-season win at Doncaster Rovers. Tweet \nGraham joined the League Two side earlier this month and has impressed in his early appearances. \nHe has played five times for the U's and his last game was scheduled to be tomorrow against Barnet. \nBut the former Villa man is now set to stay at the Kassam Stadium for at least two more months. \nGraham said earlier this week he was keen to make up for the red card he recently received against Leyton Orient, which meant he sat out Tuesday's victory over Plymouth. \nHe told BBC Radio Oxford: \"It's almost been the perfect month for me. \n\"But, the sending off has made it a better loan really. \n\"I'm better off learning things like this now when I'm still young than later in my career during an important cup final.\" \n\"My dad told me these things happen to all players in football. \n\"I just have to learn from it and make sure I don't put my teammates in a position like that again. \n\"But, I'm really enjoying my time here. I've been playing well, we've been winning and everyone's happy. \n\"I've spoken to Wolves about how much I've enjoyed it and I think the paperwork's being sorted to keep me here a bit longer.\" \nThe 20-year-old has yet to feature in Wolves' first team. \nOn the loan extension Graham tweeted to say: \"Delighted to announce I am staying until the new year. Loving my time here, looking forward to tomorrow's game and hopefully another win!\" \nWolves have a 24-hour recall clause in the deal.
