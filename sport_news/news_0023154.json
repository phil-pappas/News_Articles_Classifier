Prior to that, they had won five games in a row.Momentum has both carried the Greyhounds and dragged them down at different times this season, and lately it's taken its toll on this talented team. The players and coaches are hoping they can sustain a recent rash of injuries and their residual mental pressures long enough to turn the tide of momentum back in their direction.\"It's been one thing after another, and we can't seem to find our ground right now,\" Naugy coach Lisa Mariano said of her 6-5 Greyhounds.Eleven days ago, Naugy lost its leading scorer, Sara Marques, to a knee injury. The senior team captain who had nine goals and five assists in the first six games, is still waiting for the results of her MRI to find out the severity of the injury and whether she can come back this season.\"One of our other outside mids (Nicole Crowley) has a knee injury,\" Mariano said. \"One of our backs, Bridget (Rosikiewicz), is just coming back from injury so she is kind of like 50-50. Jasmine (Grey) our center back, her ankle is bothering her. Our starting forward, Hailey Boulanger, she is out with a concussion. Now Hannah (Lauer), our other outside mid might be out for a couple days, as well.\"With Marques and the others missing games, playing at less than 100 percent or playing out of position, the Greyhounds have been shut out in the four of their last five games. Mariano said the team is just trying to hold its ground, figure out its new identity, re-work the chemistry with girls playing out of position and regain momentum.It's not as easy as just getting healthy again.\"I do believe that as much physical work as we have, we have emotional work to do, as well,\" Mariano said. \"If I had to categorize everything right now, our biggest link is from an emotional standpoint we have to get a little tougher in that department.\"She said she doesn't believe her players are feeling sorry for themselves, but they just haven't found a way to find the strength in each other just yet as they battle through the adversity.\"Some teams when they face adversity they find a way to fight through it, and we seem to be going the other way a little bit right now,\" Mariano said. \"We just need to work on it. I know that they want to develop, they want to win and they want to play together. It is all there. We just have to pull it out of them.\"Although the Greyhounds have had troubles of late, two of their losses were non-league games. They are still 6-3 in the Naugatuck Valley League with a very good chance of making the NVL tournament.\"Our big goal, we talked about it as a team, is winning the championship,\" senior center back Jasmine Grey said. \"I believe in us. I have grown up with these girls, and I know how we play. I trust my teammates. I'm hoping as a team we can work together and balance that out. Even though we are missing girls, we can still fight though the season. We can do it.\" \nFollow Us", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:26:33.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
