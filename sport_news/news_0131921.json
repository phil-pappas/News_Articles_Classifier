They could have doubled the lead in the 10th minute after being awarded a penalty-corner, but India's goalkeeper, Suraj Karkera, brought off a good save. \nThe Indians restored parity in the 17th minute through Sumit Kumar, who scored after the ball ricocheted off the English ‘keeper’s pads. \nSumit then put India into the lead for the first time, finding the net from a field goal in the 26th minute. \nWhen Manpreet scored in the 29th minute to make it 3-1, it looked as if the defending champions would emerge easy winners, but Luke Taylor pulled a goal back from a penalty-corner to take Great Britain into the breather trailing 2-3. \nGreat Britain pressed hard for the equaliser and found it in the 47th minute through Jack Clee. \nTwo minutes from the hooter, Taylor clinched victory for Great Britain from a penalty-corner. \nIndia face Argentina next on October 14. \nImage: Action in the fifth Sultan of Johor Cup match between India and Great Britain. \nPhotograph: Hockey India", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:57:46.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
