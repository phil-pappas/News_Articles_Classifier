The #cricketallstars are coming with @ShaneWarne @sachin_rt to @CitiField. 13th Man?,\" it tweeted with a file picture of Obama and Brian Lara in left-hander's batting stance. It was later retweeted by Warne to his 2.36 million plus followers. \nIn the year 2009, Obama had got cricket lessons from Lara. And the West Indian legend had presented a cricket bat with his signature with the message, \"To the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in appreciation of your visit to T&T (Trinidad and Tobago). Best Wishes\". \n\"I always wanted to meet the Michael Jordan of cricket,\" Obama had told Lara. Obama had posed playing a shot with the same bat of Lara's. \nTendulkar, in an interview recently, said he was hoping that Americans would be inspired by these matches and pick up a cricket bat. Warne and Tendulkar finalise the plans for All Stars Series \n\"If Americans can start coming to the stadium, I wouldn't be surprised to see them following cricket from here on. I'm not just looking forward to this trip but to my next trip. I would like to see how many more people have picked up a cricket bat alongside a baseball bat. Because that means we left an impression behind. That's something I want to do,\" Tendulkar said. \nIt will be interesting to see whether Obama accepts this invitation and makes a visit to see Tendulkar, Warne and other greats in action in New York. — Cricket All Stars (@T20AllStars) October 8, 2015 Touched base with our people on the ground in America, ticket sales flying, get in quick http://t.co/YMzCgLRAQm https://t.co/fIxvQ4nkUa — Shane Warne (@ShaneWarne) October 8, 2015 Great news followers The @T20AllStars is coming to the USA. @sachin_rt & I are very excited & hope to see you there https://t.co/4QnzrJfeNM — Shane Warne (@ShaneWarne) October 6, 2015 \nOneIndia News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:54:39.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
