Grillo won the tournament on the second playoff hole. ... more > By DOUG FERGUSON -   \nNAPA, Calif. (AP) - The two lasting images of Emiliano Grillo in his PGA Tour rookie debut were both misses. \nAnd then he made the one putt he could afford to miss. \n“This is the greatest moment in my life in golf,” the 23-year-old Argentine said Sunday after his playoff win in the Frys.com Open. \nGrillo was trying to make a move up the leaderboard Saturday afternoon when he was told on the 296-yard 17th hole that the green was clear. His tee shot was just left of the green, and only later did he realize it came within inches of hitting Rory McIlroy. \nThat was a good miss. \nMcIlroy, who struggled all week with his putter, joked later it would have “put me out of my misery” if it had hit him. \nGrillo said he thought about running over a few fairways to find him for an apology, but his thoughts were occupied by another matter Sunday afternoon. First, he rolled in a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-5 18th hole for a 3-under 69 that eventually landed him in a playoff with Kevin Na, who birdied the 18th for a 70. \nOn the first extra hole, Grillo looked like a winner when he hit a chip shot across the 18th to 3 feet above the hole, and Na had a long two-putt just to make par. Step over the putt, rap it and the kid would be a PGA Tour winner in the season opener. \nHe missed. \nThe momentary shock came from a putt the same distance that he missed seven months earlier in the Puerto Rico Open that cost him a chance to win, and he lost in a playoff. He later said that miss gave him nightmares for a week. “One of the most painful times of my life,” he said. \nAfter what seemed like a long drive back to the 18th tee for a second playoff hole, the Argentine gathered himself. Even after two mediocre shots, he delivered an aggressive approach to just under 10 feet. \nAnd the next mistake belonged to Na. \nAfter getting a reprieve with Grillo’s missed birdie putt, he was in the 18th fairway and chose for the second time to hit driver off the deck. It worked out fine on the first extra hole, not so much on the second. Na hooked it so far left that a tree blocked his path to the green. He hit wedge onto and over the green, chipped well past the hole and made bogey. Grillo only needed two putts for the win. \nHe made it, throwing both arms in the air. \nNa defended his decision to hit driver from the tight grass on the fairway, suggesting in a brief Golf Channel interview when it was over that maybe it was getting darker or the ball was slightly above his feet, but he probably would have hit the same shot again. He did not come to the media room for an interview, typical of playoff losers. Na walked away with $648,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:21:38.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
