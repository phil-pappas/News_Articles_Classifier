Family members requested privacy. \n“He has a lot of friends who will support the family through this really hard time,” Gregg said. \nBui was a student in the Highline Public School’s Technology, Engineering and Communication high school on the Evergreen campus, district officials said. \nHe was among two high school students seriously injured in separate games Friday night. \nAdna senior David Young suffered a neck fracture and remains in satisfactory condition at Harborview, his stepfather said. \nBoth injuries reportedly occurred while the players were making tackles. \nBui was taken to Harborview by ambulance after being injured in the fourth quarter of a game against Highline High School at Highline Memorial Stadium. Both schools are in the Highline School District. \nYoung’s team was playing against Napavine High School. Adna and Napavine are in Lewis County. Young was taken to a local hospital, then transferred to Harborview. \nMike Colbrese, executive director of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association, said the WIAA’s hearts and thoughts are with the family and the community. \n“We haven’t had injuries like this since 2009,” he said. \nThat’s the year that Drew Swank, a 17-year-old football player from Spokane died after suffering a head injury in an early-season game.
