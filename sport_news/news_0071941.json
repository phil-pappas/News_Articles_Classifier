Becoming annoyed at having to constantly remove and replace his phone from his pocket, he was inspired to design a better and more convenient way to carry a smartphone while engaged in physical activities. The next day, he went home, designed, and then built the patent-pending PHONE PACK prototype.\nThe PHONE PACK is a harness and phone-holding pouch that allows smartphone users to conveniently and securely carry their smartphones while engaging in their favorite activities while on the job site. It secures a user's smartphone in a convenient location, allowing the user to protect, secure and easily access the phone during daily and specialized activities. This device is ergonomic and perfect for the active leisure user or the busy, on-the-go professional.\nThe original design was submitted to the Pittsburgh office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
