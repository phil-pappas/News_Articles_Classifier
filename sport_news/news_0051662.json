He's set to land in Eugene at 11:40 a.m. Friday, then fly down to Roseburg by helicopter, according to details released by the White House.\nHe has no public appearances scheduled for the trip.\nAfter last Thursday's shooting at the college, Obama renewed his call for tougher gun laws.\nThat message – and his Roseburg visit -- has caused animosity among Douglas County conservatives. One group says protests have been planned for three different locations in the city and organizers expect 2,400 people to attend. One of those locations is the Roseburg Airport.\nTweets from https://twitter.com/Oregonian/lists/ucc-shooting\nAccording to the protest's Facebook page, Defend Roseburg , 57,000 people were invited to the events. The page features a photograph of a doormat with the message across it that reads, \"Not Welcome!\"\nProtesters await President Obama's arrival at Roseburg airport Protesters lined Aviation Drive near the Roseburg airport in anticipation of President Obama's arrival Friday morning. Some said they felt the president is politicizing last week's shooting to support a gun control agenda, interfering with the community's grieving process. Obama supporter hopes to represent 'silent majority' Dulcie Bagley, a resident of Roseburg, shows her support for President Obama.\nThe group suggested demonstrators bring water, snacks and firearms if they feel the need to, but only handguns and to keep them holstered.\n\"Show the world that American gun owners are responsible patriots,\" a post by the group reads. \"Look out for each other.\"\n-- Rebecca Woolington\nrwoolington@oregonian.com\n503-294-4049; @rwoolington\n— Ian K.
