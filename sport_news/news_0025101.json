This week Rose was given a face mask to wear so he can continue to get ready for the 2015-16 season. Unfortunately, it looks like this face mask is highly uncomfortable for him. It looks too tight. It looks like he can't see. It just looks bad all around. Not to mention this mask has given him permanent stink face.\nGet well soon, Derrick. That looks awful.\nAdChoices Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/chicago-bulls"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:56:20.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
