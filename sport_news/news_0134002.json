Image 12 of 12 Tweet this: Longhorns stun Sooners 1 / 12 Back to Gallery DALLAS — The fitness center at the Omni Park West hotel is open 24 hours per day, and contains two treadmills. Saturday at 3:30 a.m., only one was occupied.\nPlodding away on the rubber belt was a 55-year-old insomniac with the weight of a sagging football program on his shoulders and a million thoughts racing through his head.
