Courtesy photo. Jamestown artist Leslie Hurst spent the month of May painting in France. Her new exhibit, “The French Connection,” showcases her experience in 26 paintings — from the cafe scenes of Paris to the lavender and wildflowers of the French countryside. The exhibit opens Friday at the Ventana Art Gallery in downtown Sonora, with a catered French soirée reception from 5 to 7:30 p.m. Saturday. Also at the reception, the Tuolumne County Arts Alliance will be pouring wine and displaying work by George Post. Following trips to paint in Italy, Alaska and Hong Kong, Hurst said she was pleased to discover France. “In France, there’s something different around every corner,” she said. Hurst was based in St. Remy, a little town in southern France that’s about the size of Sonora. It’s also where Vincent van Gogh lived in 1889. “Walking out to paint in the mornings, knowing these were the same trees, hills and fields he saw 125 years ago was very special,” she said. While painting on site en plein air, Hurst said local residents would often approach her and want to talk in French. Hurst joked about her French-speaking skills — or lack thereof — despite taking lessons to try and communicate with the locals. “Sometimes they give up and throw their hands in the air,” she said with a laugh. “Other times, they go and bring back a bottle of wine.” Hurst lives and paints at Hurst Ranch in Jamestown, where they grow their own wine grapes and olives. She can also be found each week at the Sonora Farmers Market selling the ranch’s Table Mountain Beef. Born and raised on a cattle ranch in eastern Washington, Hurst graduated from Washington State University with a degree in fine arts. Hurst put her art on the back burner while she raised her now-adult children. She returned to her passion of painting in 1995. “I’ve been painting for 20 years, although I’ve changed my medium,” she said. Hurst spent the first four years painting watercolor, followed by pastels and a brief stint with acrylics before settling on oil. “Finally, I found oil painting, and I’ve never looked back,” she said. In addition to the Ventana Gallery, Hurst has her paintings on display at Pinecrest Art Gallery, Square i Gallery in Claremont and First Street Gallery and Frame Company in Turlock. Large oil paintings -— based from smaller paintings that she created in France — were painted in her Jamestown studio. Although she went to France alone to paint, Hurst had friends and family visit her throughout the month. “My daughter Amy and I had a wonderful meal in the Latin Quarter on a rainy evening. The row of restaurants had plastic up to protect their patios from the rain, and it reflected all the neon lights in fantastic pinks and oranges,” she said of her painting, “Paris on a Rainy Night.” Another painting included in the upcoming exhibit is titled “Lavender Fields.” “May is just a little too early for the lavender fields for which Provence is famous. Everywhere I went, the plants were tight and green and not blooming at all,” she said. “Then one day, while driving in the valley below Bonnieu, I found this field just beginning so I went back every few days hoping — and just two days before I had to leave, voila!” While she’s interested in traveling to paint in Ireland someday, Hurst said she will be staying close to home next year to paint around Tuolumne County. Hurst said she enjoys not only traveling to new places, but also returning home with a new perspective. “When I go away and come back things look different to me,” she said.
