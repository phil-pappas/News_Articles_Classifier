NFL acknowledges game clock error in Steelers-Chargers game Associated Press | \nThe NFL acknowledges that one of the game officials should have noticed that 18 seconds were incorrectly run off the clock late in the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh's 24-20 victory at San Diego. \nLeague spokesman Michael Signora says in a statement emailed Monday that \"an error by the clock operator\" after a touchback allowed extra time to run off, and \"it is the responsibility of the side judge to supervise the timing of the game.\" \nThe statement adds: \"Had the side judge or any of the other six on-field officials noticed the timing error, they could have corrected it.\" \nThe NFL will review the work done by the clock operator and game officials. \n___ \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:27:17.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
