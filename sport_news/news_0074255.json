We talk about that a lot about . . . a different vibe. Here, it's about me and my game.\" Holmes hurts ankle \nRichaun Holmes injured his ankle midway through the training camp session Wednesday morning and did not return. The rookie power forward was held out of the evening practice. \n\"I doubt if we will see him tomorrow,\" coach Brett Brown said. \". . . He will probably be out for 24 hours at least.\" \nThe coach said Holmes did not sprain his ankle. \n\"It's a little bit more going on at the base on the Achilles that I'm going to learn more about later,\" Brown said. Embiid update \nHinkie said Joel Embiid will wear a cast on his right foot for \"just a few more weeks.\" \nThe 7-foot center had bone graft surgery in August to repair the navicular bone in his right foot. Embiid, the third overall pick in the 2014 draft, will miss his second straight season because of the injury. \nEmbiid was back in Philadelphia on Wednesday after spending a couple of days with the team at the Shore. \n\"He can't do very much right now,\" Hinkie said. \"The things he can do, which are limited, are nutrition, medication, sleep and staying off [his foot].\" \nThe former Kansas standout will begin a range-of-motion and non-weight-bearing rehabilitation process once he sheds the cast. \n- Keith Pompey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:03:37.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
