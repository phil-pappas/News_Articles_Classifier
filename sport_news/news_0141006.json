Continues to impress following his move from Celtic. \nJeffrey Schlupp (Leicester) - Often an attacking threat whether being started at full-back or on the wing, and certainly was in the Foxes' 2-1 win at Norwich having been selected in the more advanced position. Capped his performance with what proved to be the winning goal. \nWilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace) - Restored to the Palace first XI and a thorn in West Brom's side as Albion succumbed to a 2-0 defeat at Selhurst Park. \nKevin de Bruyne (Manchester City) - Team-mate Sergio Aguero rightly grabbed the headlines with his quintet of goals in the 6-1 demolition of Newcastle, but De Bruyne - scorer of his team's other effort - was also superb. The hefty fee City paid for him becomes more and more understandable with each performance at the moment. \nDavid Silva (Manchester City) - Another City man who, as is so often the case, was outstanding. Both his and De Bruyne's creative skills were key to making Aguero's goal glut happen. \nVictor Moses (West Ham) - Is producing some eye-catching form while on loan from Chelsea and did well to set up the Hammers' first goal in their 2-2 draw at Sunderland. \nAlexis Sanchez (Arsenal) - Followed up his hat-trick against Leicester last weekend with two delightful goals early in the 3-0 win over Manchester United. The Chile forward's resurgence goes on. \nSergio Aguero (Manchester City) - Quite simply the man of the weekend as he became the fifth player to score five goals in a Premier League game.
