He rightly stated that in a country chiefly inhabited by non-Christian races it was difficult to justify the grant to Christian ministers of concessions which were denied to those of other religions to whom, however, \"the extension was impracticable for reasons for revenue.\" The British as a nation are very pious, and their religious and charitable grants are admired by all. Not only are the missions maintained by fights but missionary efforts are furthered in every direction. In his own country the minister buys most things at concession rates, he books his luggage and good at concession rates and obtains concessions from Government in several directions such as the Y.M.C.A. work, the reclamation of criminal classes, etc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:14:55.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
