The Indians were missing several key starters, most notably quarterback Will LaGuardia and linebacker Alec Jimerson, and the Indians were coming off their first loss of the year last week to Langston Hughes. \nNone of that mattered though as the Indians romped the visiting Falcons for a 34-7 victory. The win kept the Indians in line to compete for a Region 3- title, staying one game back of Langston Hughes and tied with Westlake and Newnan at 3-1. \nEast Coweta jumped out early, taking the opening drive 62 yards in eight plays, aided by a facemask penalty against Pebblebrook on a failed third down conversion by the Indians that kept the drive alive. Fullback Carlos Ford capped off the drive with a bruising 32-yard run up the middle on a third-and-one to make it 7-0 with 8:22 left in the opening quarter. \n“I have always been a big fan of ‘next man up,’” Indians head coach Steve Pardue said. “That’s what we had tonight. We were missing Will and Alec and some key lineman, but Christian and the others guys stepped up and played a great game, and that’s what you have to do.” \nEast Coweta's next drive did not go as well as they failed on a fake punt at their own 38-yard line. The Falcons drove all the way to the Indians' 1-yard line, but East Coweta forced a fumble on first down that was recovered in the end zone by Reggie Jones for the first of his two defensive turnovers that included an interception. \nThe Indians' offense extended the lead to 14-0 with 5:36 left in the half on a two-yard run by Calvin Kirby. East Coweta added another score with 1:06 to go in the half on a well-executed option keeper by Reid that allowed him to go untouched from 11 yards out to push the Indians’ lead to 20-0 after Wyatt Palmer had his streak of 23 straight successful PATs snapped. \nBut East Coweta pulled further away in the second half, scoring on consecutive drives in between the final two quarters. With 2 minutes left in the third, Reid executed another option fake, this time from 13 yards out to make it 27-0. \nTwo plays later, Jones came up with his pick of Pebblebrook quarterback Jacobe Burke to give the Indians the ball at the Falcons' 34. It led to another scoring drive on four plays that ended when Reid hit senior receiver Nick Clarke from six yards to make it 34-0 with 11:25 to play. \n“We were able to extend the lead and put the game away early in the fourth, which was a good way to bounce back,” said Pardue, whose team travels to Douglas County (1-6, 1-3) next week. “We are at the point where the most important game is the next one. Douglas County is a good football team. I have a lot of respect for their program and for coach [Jason] Respert. We had a hiccup last week, and now we have to just take them one game at a time the rest of the way.” \nA fumbled punt gave Pebblebrook the ball and its only score late in the fourth quarter. Burke ran in from two yards away to cap a 29-yard drive and make it 34-7 with 5:17 to play. \nIndians 34, Falcons 7 \nPebblebrook 0 0 0 7 — 7 \nEast Coweta 7 13 7 7 — 34 \n1st Quarter \nEC- Carlos Ford 32-yard run (Wyatt Palmer kick), 8:22 \n2nd Quarter \nEC- Calvin Kirby 2-yard run (Palmer kick), 5:36 \nEC- Christian Reid 11-yard run (Palmer missed PAT), 1:06 \n3rd Quarter \nEC- Reid 13-yard run (Palmer kick), 5:36 \n4th Quarter \nEC- Reid 6-yard pass to Nick Clarke (Palmer kick), 11:25 \nPB- Jacobe Burke 2-yard run (Uziel Moreno kick), 5:17 More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:51:47.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
