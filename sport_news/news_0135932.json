They are good drivers. I really hope they do well,” said a suddenly sincere Reynolds, who shares the same Ford team garage as the female drivers. \nBut it was too little, too late. \nThe female team showed they would not take any lip when they fired back at Johnson on Wednesday. \n“Dick Johnson hasn’t finished heaps of races so he can’t talk,” said Gracie. \nDe Silvestro – one of only three women to notch an IndyCar podium – said before practice it would be good to silence the knockers. \n“Because the attention is on us if we don’t finish it would be a shame,” she said. \n“There are others who won’t either. \n“But I think we will prove them (critics) wrong.” \nIn all, 31 women have contested the Bathurst 1000 with a best placing of sixth – Australia’s Christine Gibson (1981) and France’s Marie-Claude Beaumont (1975). \nGracie and de Silvestro will become the 15th all-female entry in the Great Race.
