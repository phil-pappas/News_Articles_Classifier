Tuesday evening at Wrigley Field, the Cubs beat the Cardinals to win the best-of-five NLDS three games to one (CHC 6, STL 4). Chicago awaits the winner of the Mets-Dodgers NLDS matchup. \nHere are eight things to know about Game 4 between the Cubs and Cardinals. \n1. The Cubs finally clinched a postseason series at home. \nFor the first time in franchise history, the Cubs have clinched a postseason series at Wrigley Field. They clinched every other postseason win on the road. Of course, we're talking about a sample size of four series. Here is the list of the team's postseason series wins: \n1907 World Series over Tigers (clinched at Bennett Park)1908 World Series over Tigers (clinched at Bennett Park)2003 NLDS over Braves (clinched at Turner Field)2015 NLDS over Cardinals (clinched at Wrigley Field)That's it. That's the list. The Cubs have only won four postseason series in their history and Tuesday's win was their first clincher at home. Crazy. \n2. Baez's three-run home run was magic. \nThe Cubs took the lead in the second inning on Javier Baez's three-run home run. It turned a 2-1 deficit into a 4-2 lead. Three singles (Anthony Rizzo, Kyle Schwarber, Jason Hammel) set the rally up. \nObviously hitting a home run is an impressive accomplishment in and of itself, but look at the location of the pitch Baez hit for the three-run dinger (video): \nI took the liberty of drawing a line to mark the outer edge of home plate for reference. That's a first-pitch fastball roughly two or three (or four) inches off the plate, a pitch that likely would have been called a ball. \nInstead, Baez was able to reach out and drive that pitch out of the park. You're not supposed to be able to drive a pitch in that location with any authority, nevermind muscle it out of the park. Crazy impressive by Baez. \n3. Unsung hero: Justin Grimm. \nCubs skipper Joe Maddon had Hammel on a very short leash. Hammel had a strong year overall (3.74 ERA and 104 ERA+) but really struggled down the stretch, pitching to a 5.65 ERA in his final nine starts and 43 innings. So, after Hammel gave up a two-run homer to Stephen Piscotty in the first inning, Maddon had the bullpen already working. \nHammel managed to grind his way through the second and third innings, but a four-pitch leadoff walk to Jhonny Peralta in the fourth ended his afternoon. He threw 49 pitches and allowed two runs on three hits and three walks in three innings. Maddon had seen enough. \nIn came reliever Justin Grimm, who coaxed a tailor made 5-4-3 double play ball from Randal Grichuk. The problem? Kris Bryant booted it. Just a straight up error. No funny hops, nothing like that. Bryant just misplayed it. That put runners on first and second with no outs, and brought the tying run to the plate. \nSuddenly, the Cardinals were threatening. And in an eye blink, Grimm shut the rally down with three straight strikeouts. He fanned Kolten Wong, Tony Cruz and pinch-hitter Tommy Pham, all on four pitches. Grimm got five swings and misses out of those dozen pitches. He was throwing heat too: \nThat was a gift-wrapped rally for the Cardinals -- four-pitch walk and an error! -- who had a chance to make things very interesting. Instead, Grimm punched out three straight batters and escaped the jam. His performance shouldn't be forgotten. Those were some huge outs, even if it was only the fourth inning. \n4. Sending Cruz in the sixth inning was a good idea. \nThe Cardinals rallied to tie the game in the sixth inning in the most Cardinals way possible. They smacked a couple of singles and got a double to stay fair down the first-base line. Cruz had the big two-out, two-strike double against Trevor Cahill to get St. Louis to within 4-3, then pinch-hitter Brandon Moss singled to make it 4-4. \nCruz, a backup catcher with backup catcher speed, was thrown out at the plate by Jorge Soler to end the inning. He represented the go-ahead run. Here's video of the play: \nAny time a runner is thrown out at the plate, the immediate reaction seems to be, \"That was a bad send,\" but I don't think that was the case this time. Yes Cruz is slow, but Soler is not the best right-field defender out there -- in fact, he bobbled Cruz's double earlier in the inning -- and it forced the Cubs to make a play. \nSoler made a damn near perfect throw to the plate, Miguel Montero received the ball cleanly, and Cruz was still only barely out. His foot was over home plate when the tag was applied, in fact. His foot hit the ground a split second early and popped up. It didn't work but I liked the send. Everything went right for the Cubs -- perfect throw, clean catch, goofy slide -- and Cruz was still almost safe. \n5. Siegrist threw Rizzo a Very Bad Pitch in the sixth inning. \nI was surprised to see Rizzo and Kevin Siegrist have already faced each other 23 times during the regular season. Yes, they're division rivals, but neither has been in the league very long. Buster Posey and Kenley Jansen have faced each other only 15 times, by comparison. Rizzo and Siegrist have seen a lot of each other in a short amount of time. \nIn Game 3 on Monday, Rizzo took Siegrist deep for a solo home run that gave the Cubs some insurance in the eventual win. In Game 4 on Tuesday, Rizzo got to Siegrist again, this time hitting a go-ahead solo home run in the sixth. It broke the 4-4 tie and proved to be the game-winning run. It was a Very Bad Pitch, I'd say: \nThat's an 0-2 breaking ball -- a strikeout count, obviously -- and Siegrist hung it like laundry on the clothesline. Look at where Cruz set up and wanted this pitch: \nCruz wanted it down and away, well out of the zone. He was okay with Rizzo taking it for a ball. Instead, it was a meatball over the heart of the plate. \nSiegrist's numbers against left-handed batters were shockingly bad during the regular season -- .278/.406/.405 (125 OPS+) with nearly as many walks (18) as strikeouts (20) -- and he proceeded to allow an insurance solo home run to Schwarber in the seventh inning as well. That wasn't a Very Bad Pitch though. It was actually a pretty good pitch inside. Schwarber just pulled his hands in and yanked it to right field. \n6. The big names didn't produce for the Cardinals. \nIt's kind of amazing the Cardinals managed to score 17 runs in the four-game series despite getting very little from the big names in their lineup: \nUpdating those numbers for the rest of Game 4, the trio of Matt Carpenter, Matt Holliday and Peralta went a combined 7 for 40 (.175) in the four-game series. Your best players need to be your best players in the postseason, and those three didn't three didn't get the job done offensively in these four games. Jason Heyward and Piscotty were the big bats for St. Louis. \n7. Soler finally made an out. \nAfter reaching base in each of his first nine plate appearances of the postseason, Soler finally made an out in Game 4. He struck out on six pitches the first inning. Prior to that, Soler's nine postseason plate appearances went: \nWalk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:53:02.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
