Each homeowner needs to prepare defensible space, plan for evacuation and contribute to local fire protection. The relatively quick containment of the Oak Fire is a credit to locally based firefighters. But other factors also contributed: the fire soon ran out of uphill slope; a shaded fuel break was in place on the ridge; the outdoor learning center and camp maintained defensible space; they also planned for evacuation and maintained a second escape route; no local fires competed for resources; state and heavy federal air tankers were quickly available. However, one of the closest fire resources was notably absent; the Crystal Falls Volunteer Fire Station still has no volunteers. The fire resources available for the Butte and Valley Fires are not so different from our own. We have been fortunate. Throughout rural California paid staffed fire stations are few and far between. Volunteer enrollment has declined. When citizens enroll, train and respond as volunteer firefighters, they can significantly reduce the risk to lives and property in their community, and to their own family, home and business.
