Didn’t have that sense a lot on the bench last year.\n“I knew they would scratch and claw right to the bitter end. But it was a bitter end if we didn’t have the lead a lot of those nights.”\nIf early-season production from Ehlers and Petan wasn’t completely expected, then neither was the explosive start by Mark Scheifele, not known for busting out of the gate.\nScheifele flashes a brief smile when asked about his three goals, but really gets going when talking about the kids.\n“The skill they have is pretty unbelievable,” Scheifele said. “It’s pretty sweet to play with those guys.”\nYou wonder if Scheifele sees a bit of himself in the rookies. After all, it wasn’t long ago he was dealing with the same things, a skilled player adjusting to a man’s game in a boy’s body and with a boy’s mind.\nSee the similarities from two years ago?\n“Just about everything,” Scheifele agreed. “It’s tough coming in as a young guy and trying to make an impression. Trying to play your way and mix it with the way the team plays. You’ve got a lot of emotions, a lot of everything — buddies talking to you about the play you made the night before.\n“But they’re pretty mature guys.”\nScheifele says he tries to help, and the kids could do worse than follow his lead.\nInitially unable to produce, No. 55 worked hard on the lesser-known points of the game — the defensive responsibility, the positioning, faceoffs — while waiting for the offence to come.\nBut he’d rather talk about watching the rookies grow.\n“Especially Nik Ehlers ... it’s pretty cool — I see things that he goes through and I’m like, ‘Man, I literally went through the exact same thing.’ ”\nLeading the way, though, is still the “old guard” — Blake Wheeler’s five points, Mark Stuart’s plus-6 (along with Jacob Trouba) and Dustin Byfuglien’s three penalties.\nOK, maybe that last one isn’t an example to follow.\n“We had a chat about that,” Maurice said of the team’s penchant for being in the box. “I’m surprised at the number, to be honest. I can live with the penalties we took against the Rangers. Because they were part of a compete package that is who we are as a team. The penalties we took against the Islanders were not acceptable.”\nThe penalties are a continuation of last season.\nI guess you can’t learn everything in one year.\n“That’s almost expected now,” Wheeler said, chuckling. “I don’t know. We scored a shorthanded goal last game so it doesn’t feel like a big issue now.”\nThen a sober second thought.\n“We’ve got to stay out of the box — that’s obviously a key. We’re aware of it.”\nAsk Maurice what’s on top of his fix-it list, and he doesn’t mention penalties, but high-risk plays.\nWhile implementing new concepts to create more offence this season, the boss has seen some unwanted side effects of his bulked-up attack.\n“We’re scoring some goals, but we’ve given up two three-on-one goals in the last two games,” Maurice said. “Great players make the risky plays ... if you’re not making them, you’re just a risky player.\n“Nobody’s coming off the bench hearing, ‘Dump that puck.’ But we’re going to have to spend the year really defining what a good decision is.”\nAs for a good season, well, the start doesn’t define that, either.\nThe Jets learned that last year.\n“Nobody’s getting any, ‘Hey we’re 3-1’ tattoos,” Maurice cracked.\nGood plan.\nBecause angst can be just a home opener away.\nWinnipeg Jets eager to see what they can do on home ice Maurice: 'Nobody's getting any, 'Hey we're 3-1' tattoos'\nBy Paul Friesen , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 02:58 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 15, 2015 08:12 PM EDT\nThe Winnipeg Jets will take a 3-1 record and near-perfect health into their home opener against Calgary, Friday.\nOnly defenceman Ben Chiarot is expected to miss a second straight game, as the Jets become the last NHL team to play on home ice.\nWith six straight games here, Winnipeg has a chance to put some points in the bank — if it can quickly establish the identity it wants to have in its own building.\n“We didn't do that until March last year,” head coach Paul Maurice said, Thursday. “We were a middling team and we got home and needed to be good, and it became a very good place for us. You can't be bad at home and expect to have a good season.”\nMaurice says it's too early to draw too many conclusions about his team.\nAsked to name one pleasant surprise, he points to the improved skill level and ability to score. Winnipeg and Ottawa lead the NHL with 15 goals.\n“Some of the creativity, how we moved the puck,” Maurice said. “We played very poorly on\nAbout the author Paul Friesen Follow Paul Friesen on Twitter Other Stories CFL close to a solution on drug testing\nThe CFL with a strong, working drug policy and a sold-out Winnipeg Grey Cup?\n0\nWhere's the angst?
