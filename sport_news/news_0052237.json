After the Aviators matched that score with a 35-yard TD run on fourth down by quarterback James Pikowski, Stone went 65 yards on the next play, breaking at least five tackles along the right sideline. \n\"We knew he was a very dangerous runner,\" Heights coach Nick DelCalzo said. \n\"We were looking to keep him from getting to the outside because that’s where he is most dangerous.\" \nPikowski answered Stone’s second score with his second touchdown, a 5-yard run after he scrambled out of the pocket on third down. \nSt. Mary was forced to punt and Brian Moran went 37 yards on the ensuing play to set up his own 2-yard TD that put Hasbrouck Heights (5-1) up 21-14 with 12 seconds left in the first quarter. \nA fumble recovery by Matt DiChiara set up another Aviator score, this one an 11-yard touchdown catch by Josh Hanrahan on a throw from Frank Quatrone, who was returning to action after missing three games with an ankle injury. \n\"The line gave me a lot of time and I saw Josh come open over the middle. I put it up there and he made a great catch in traffic,\" Quatrone said of Hanrahan’s grab between two defenders. \nThat made it 28-14 at the half, as Heights was picking up big chunks of rushing yardage behind sophomore center James Varga, senior guards Eric Salas and Scott Salerno and senior tackles Sean O’Malley and Kevin Kaloshi. \n\"What an effort on their part,\" DelCalzo said. \"We knew they were bigger up front but our guys played very tough and won that battle.’ \nMoran (eight carries, 72 yards) went out late in the first half with an injury and Pikowski (11 carries, 79 yards) was dinged in the opening series of the second half. \nThat left the run game to Scalvino, who lugged it 19 times for 148 yards after the intermission. \nScalvino scored on a 23-yard run on that first third-quarter series and added a 44-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter as Hasbrouck Heights ended up with 290 rushing yards. \nStone scored twice more in the second half after switching to quarterback. He had a 7-yarder that made the score 35-21 in the third, and a 19-yarder that had the Gaels within 42-28 with 4:40 to go in the game. \nStone finished with 233 yards on 19 carries.
