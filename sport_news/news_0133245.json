Though Leonard Fournette is easily the best running back in college, NFL legend Herschel Walker had even higher praise for the LSU superstar.\nAdChoices According to TMZ Sports, the 1982 Heisman Trophy winner said Fournette is a better player now than he—Walker—was while at the University of Georgia.\n“He’s better than I was,” Walker said. “He’s like a fullback because he can take punishment and keep on going.”\nFournette, who is only a sophomore, could declare for the NFL draft and be a first-round pick in 2016 were it not for an NCAA rules that stipulates a player must stay for three seasons after his high school graduation.\nBecause there’s absolutely no doubt Fournette is ready.\nFournette opened the 2015 campaign with a 159-yard, three-touchdown performance against Mississippi State, and that’s his worst game of the year. He bullied Auburn for 228 yards and three scores, then obliterated Syracuse for 244 yards, two touchdowns and a 90-yard run called back due to a penalty.\nIf a September Heisman was a real trophy, Fournette would be the unanimous choice. Nevertheless, he’s certainly a front-runner for the accolade Walker earned in 1982.\nFournette returns to the college field on Saturday, when LSU takes on Eastern Michigan—which has the worst run defense in the nation. The Eagles have surrendered an averaged of 373.3 rushing yards per game, nearly 60 more than any of the other 127 Football Bowl Subdivision programs.\nUse every opportunity to watch greatness while you can, because Fournette is one of the most dominant players the college level has ever seen. But don’t take my word for it; listen to Herschel Walker.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/09/30/herschel-walker-leonard-fournette-is-better-than-i-was/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:00:27.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
