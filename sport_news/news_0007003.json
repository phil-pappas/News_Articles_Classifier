The incident at Gurdwara Sahib on Spencers Road in Crawley, West Sussex, occurred late last month and investigations continue, Daily Sikh Updates reported. \"Police are investigating a break-in at the Sikh temple in Spencers Road, Crawley, which occurred overnight between September 25 and September 26,\" a Sussex Police spokesperson said. \"An external door and several internal doors were forced and a safe and cabinets broken into. Gold artefacts and cash worth over 2,500 pounds were stolen,\" he added. Raiders used hydraulic tools to break into the safe which had the gold artefact. \"It will cost us thousands of pounds (to replace artefact and repair damages),\" said Mohindar Galowalia, secretary of Crawley-based charity Siri Guru Singh Sabha. Police have launched a public appeal for witnesses to the break-in at the Gurdwara. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:07:01.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
