But that's exactly what the Dolphins dialed up as a red zone play last weekend for one of that win's more productive drives.\nMiami tailback Damien Williams sprinted out of the backfield and headed to his right. Dion Sims, who was lined up next to left tackle Branden Albert, faked like he was supposed to block Tennessee's Brian Orakpo. Sims released the pass rusher and quarterback Ryan Tannehill threw a screen pass to the tight end, who had Mike Pouncey and Albert as blockers on the 13-yard gain.\nThat second-quarter play, which set up the Miami's second touchdown, was one of many tight end-driven plays that the Dolphins have in the team's arsenal. With Sims' return to the lineup, and the team now being coached by Dan Campbell, a former tight end, it's safe to say Miami's opponents should expect plenty more of those plays, beginning with Sunday's 1 p.m. home game against the Houston Texans.\n\"It gives us a balance, allows us to get an advantage on defense from personnel and matchups [standpoint],\" Sims said when asked about Miami's two-tight ends packages, which were used regularly in last week's 38-10 win over the Titans.\n1st and 10: Omar Kelly's exclusive interviews with Dolphins players Watch Omar Kelly's weekly one-on-one interviews with Dolphins players on 10 quick-hitting, off-the-field questions.\nWatch Omar Kelly's weekly one-on-one interviews with Dolphins players on 10 quick-hitting, off-the-field questions.\nRead more stories Campbell, who played tight end for 11 seasons in the league, and coached that unit before replacing Joe Philbin as Miami's interim coach earlier this month, loves the two-tight end package so much he joked that he's trying to find a way to get \"four tight ends into the game.\"\nCampbell typically served as his team's second tight end during his playing career, so he's well aware of the \"two tights\" packages, which are in vogue in the NFL because of the versatility they provide offenses.\n\"That's a trend because you can do so much. If you've got guys that can do it, you can put them at fullback, you can split them out [as a receiver]. You can put them at the wing. You can put them at the H-back, you can put them at the big Y (receiver),\" Campbell said, referring to different formations, which can each cause matchup problems for a defense.\nCaption Full Episode: Have Dolphins transformed from finesse to physical team?

Miami could throw a curveball by putting him in the backfield. And the two-tight ends package becomes even more problematic when Jordan Cameron lines up out wide like a receiver.\nWho covers Cameron then, a linebacker or a safety? And what does that shift do to the opponent's defense?\n\"When you're able to do that and you can run your full arsenal of an offense,\" Campbell said, \"It just creates so many problems.\"\nMiami has used the two-tight ends package for many years. During the Tony Sparano era, Anthony Fasano and David Martin set franchise records at the position during the 2008 playoff run. Then Fasano and Charles Clay paved the way for the offense in the early Philbin years before Clay and Sims took over.\nThe torch now belongs to Cameron, who the Dolphins signed to a two-year deal that could be worth $14 million this offseason, and Sims, who played his second game of the season last week after suffering a concussion in the season opener.\nCampbell said that while Sims was sidelined for three games — which all resulted in losses — the Dolphins were forced to scrap about 40 percent of the playbook. And that's despite former practice squad player Jake Stoneburner stepping in and scoring two touchdowns during Sims' absence.\nWhen Sims, the Dolphins' best in-line blocker, returned he helped pave the way for a season-high 180 rushing yards against the Titans. Miami's tight ends also caught seven passes for 63 yards against Tennessee, and both of Tannehill's touchdown passes were caught by a tight end.\nCampbell thinks the Dolphins are merely scratching the surface of what the two-tight ends package can do for his team.\n\"It gives the defense something to think about. When you have two tight ends on the field you have no idea if it's going to be a pass or a run, so how do you play it? Dion can do everything. He's an exceptional blocker,\" Cameron said.\n\"You've got to pack the box in case it's a run. They have to be aware of it and put personnel grouping to counteract what we're doing.\"\nPrivacy Policy Miami Dolphins Joe Philbin Tennessee Titans NFL Ryan Tannehill Branden Albert Jordan Cameron", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627dfd7/turbine/fl-xs-and-omar-week-9-segment-2", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c0383/turbine/fl-dolphins-texans-advance-1025-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627ed33/turbine/fl-xs-and-omar-week-9-segment-3", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-545396c0/turbine/sfl-1st-and-10-omar-kellys-exclusive-interviews-with-dolphins-players-20141014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627dc5c/turbine/fl-xs-and-omar-week-9-segment-1", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ea488/turbine/fl-xs-and-omar-week-8-segment-1", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627f117/turbine/fl-xs-and-omar-week-9-full-episode"], "published": "2015-10-24T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:16:32.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
