Jones said the allegation was \"absolutely ridiculous.\" \nWithout specifically addressing the allegations, Crowder sent out three separate tweets saying he was \"proud \"and \"honored\" to be part of Tennessee's program. \n\"I'm proud to be a VFL (Vol For Life) and honored to be a part of this University and Vol FAMILY,\" Crowder tweeted. \"I've given my all to this program and will continue to. I want nothing more than for Vol Nation to come together and get ready to beat the Dawgs on Saturday, as my Teammates, Coaches and I are already working hard to do. Everything else is just a distraction.
