H \nSharing community and high school contributed stories Saturday October 24, 2015 October 24, 2015 | 12:01 am \nEditor’s note: Lane Lafler is a director on the Cedar Rapids USBC Board. \nBy Lane Lafler, community contributor \nThe Cedar Rapids USBC Bowling Association will induct four bowlers into the Hall of Fame Sunday at the American Legion in Marion. \nThe new members are the husband and wife duo of Cindy McBride and Richard McBride, Terry O’Connell and Dave Vig. \nCindy McBride of Marengo, co-owner of Lucky Six Bowling Center with Richard, didn’t start bowling until 1990, but became hooked right away. She met her husband at the bowling center and the love for the game, as well as for Richard, started there. They purchased Lucky Six later that year after they were married. \nShe has a high game of 279 and series of 692, along while averaging 190-plus over the last six years — all while being league secretary in eight adult leagues as well as for the kid’s leagues since 1993. Cindy also belongs to the 500 and 600 bowling clubs with the Cedar Rapids USBC. \nCindy has bowled in the women’s state tournament since 1993 and the Cedar Rapids USBC women’s city tournament. \nHer husband, Richard, started bowling at the age of 11 and, at 18, moved to Muscatine to work as a mechanic and assistant manager at the bowling center there. In the summer of 1990, he moved to Marengo where he and Cindy purchased the Lucky Six Bowling Center. \nHe has 18 300 games, three 299 games, one 298 game and three 800 series with an 805 being the highest. Richard has been a 200-plus average bowler since 1990 with his highest being 232. He has coached kid’s league for more than 10 years and was the Frank Stanek award winner in 2012. \nO’Connell started his bowling career as a teenager in the Town and Country Junior League. He has been a standout in our bowling community as well as the state since 1972 and continues to prove himself to be a force today. \nHe has been carrying 200-plus averages since 1977 in leagues, shot his first 700 series in 1978, first 800 series in 1982 and first 300 game in 1979. So far, O’Connell gas hit perfection 15 times (three in different centers in one season) and has added seven more 800 series, with his high being 842. \nO’Connell also has done very well in tournaments. He has championships in team, doubles and singles in city competition and placed fourth in doubles at the state event, a meet he has competed in for more than 25 years. He also has competed in more than 15 national tournaments. \nWhen he steps onto the lanes, he is a kind soul, but he will push you to the limits and usually dominates. \nVig started his career more than 55 years ago in Mount Vernon. He has been bowling in the association since 1960 and has bowled with his two sons, as well as his wife Barb. He has served the leagues as president and secretary and as a certified coach for kid’s leagues. \nHis resume is full of success. He owns three 300 games, four 299 games, two 290 games and more than 120 700 series with the highest being 774. Dave has held a 200-plus average for more than 15 years with a 217 as his highest while bowling on 25 league championship teams. \nVig’s tournament resume is even longer, starting in 1967. He has a championship in the men’s state tournament in doubles and a third-place finish in doubles, as well. In the city tournament, he has one team title as well as a second-place finish in doubles. While bowling in the city senior tournament, he has one title in the team and two in the all events. He was voted Bowler of the Year in 2004.
