The Dons look to finish their fourth straight regular season perfect --standing in the Dons way a one win Tri-County program. \nTri-County Trojans came out ready for a win. However, the Don Bosco football team showed on their second offensive play of the game it was going to be a lopsided affair. In fact, Nick Mangrich runs 32-yards untouched for a touchdown. The two point conversion made it eight- zero Dons. \nThree plays later Tri-County's Austin Purdy is picked off by the Dons Damien Sawvel at the Trojans 29 yard line. He rips through a tackle on his way to the house...touchdown Bosco with the two point conversion making it 16 - zero. \nThe Dons would not let off the gas. In fact, Tri-County punts on their next offensive series and it is scooped up by Dylan Reiher of the Dons and he would take off to his left, run all the way across the field, find a wall, and he runs 52-yards to the zone...touchdown Bosco....the two point conversion made it 24-zero at the end of one...with the Dons running less then four offensive plays in the first quarter. \nIt was 38-zero at the half with a final score of 64-zero Don Bosco.
