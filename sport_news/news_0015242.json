But I'll tell you what, they deserve all the credit in the world. They took it to the limit.\" \nIt was not until Bellarmine (6-1, 3-1) recovered its second onside kick by St. Francis' Courtney Ogren that the Bells could breathe a huge sigh of relief. \nSt. Francis (6-1, 3-1) pulled to within two points twice in the final two minutes, the first on Cyrus Habibi-Likio's 12-yard reception over the middle with 1:54 to go. Ogren's PAT made it 21-19, and her onside kick appeared to be St. Francis' to recover when the ball scooted free. But Bellarmine somehow found a way to get the ball. Advertisement \n\"Luckily, the ball bounced away, and one of our guys hustled to jump on top of it,\" Janda said. \nDevon Buenrostro then raced 53 yards for a touchdown to extend Bellarmine's lead to 28-19. But St. Francis was determined to fight to the finish. \nThe Lancers quickly moved inside the Bellarmine 10, and Kamalii Akina fired a 9-yard pass to Darius Thomas to make it 28-26 with 53.3 seconds to go. \nBellarmine recovered the onside kick again, and ran out the clock. \nThen it was time to celebrate. \n\"We have been looking forward to this game since freshman year,\" said Buenrostro, who rushed for 116 yards and two touchdowns in nine carries. \"We practiced good all week, and we just came out to play.\" \nTrailing by five points at halftime, Bellarmine went 80 yards on its first possession of the second half to take a lead it would not relinquish. \nSt. Francis thought it answered the touchdown on a fourth-down run from the 1. But the officials ruled the Lancers came up short of the end zone, and Bellarmine then went 99 yards in 13 plays to stretch its lead to 21-12. \n\"Our kids battled their behinds off,\" St. Francis coach Greg Calcagno said. \"Very proud of that. We battled, we thought our guy was in on the goal line. But oh well, gotta find ways -- and we did. We didn't give up.\" \nWith its crowd roaring well before the opening kickoff, St. Francis moved to midfield on the game's first series and then, when the drive stalled, punted to pin Bellarmine deep in its territory. \nTwo plays later, quarterback Troy Martig scrambled to his right in the end zone and threw the ball out of bounds. \nThe officials called it intentional grounding, and St. Francis led 2-0. \nBellarmine kicked off, and St. Francis' quickly moved into scoring territory when what looked like a broken play resulted in a 49-yard run down the sideline by Akina. \nTau Sanft plunged into the end zone from the 1 to extend the St. Francis lead to 9-0. \nBellarmine scored its only points of the half after it pinned St. Francis deep on its side of the field. Bellarmine's defense tightened, and the Bells returned a short punt to the St. Francis 14. \nBuenrostro turned the good fortune into points, running in from the 8 to make it 9-7. \nSt. Francis finished the half with a history-making moment as the program's first female kicker, Ogren, kicked her first career field goal, from 31 yards, to give the Lancers a 12-7 lead at halftime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:25:21.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
