For what it’s worth … It was great to see Victor football wrap up its regular season unbeaten at 7-0, but now the real season gets started. The Blue Devils certainly are contenders for the Section V Class AA title, but Aquinas (7-0) and Pittsford (7-0) will also have a say. Incredible Victor football stat: In Friday’s win over Gates Chili, the Blue Devils rushed for 331 yards (9.5 yards per) and 10 different players had at least one rush. Of those 10, six rushed for 30 or more yards and three ran for more than 40. How about Coron Broomfield at Canandaigua Academy? The senior has rushed for 1,316 yards this season but he’s still a long way away from the school’s single-season record of 2,344, set by Kaheem Gist in 2007. Love the way he runs, though. Hard. Round of applause for the football teams at Palmyra-Macedon and Wayne. The teams had a combined 1-11 record coming into Friday’s game, and Pal-Mac came home with a 42-30 win. But the teams also combined to raise $3,000 for the Wayne County Children’s Cancer Fund. Win or lose against the Bengals, we still won’t know what the Bills are made of. Not with all the injuries in Buffalo. Still not sure what to think of Sammy Watkins and his demand for more targets in Buffalo. I do think he tried to make it sound like he was being “team-centric,” but it’s dangerously close to sounding selfish. All I could think of was Keyshawn Johnson (young readers: Google “Keyshawn Johnson book” and you’ll understand). Hey bow hunters … was it just me or were bucks the only deer out during the first 15 days of the season? It’s as if the does knew of the new regulations, at least in area 8H. The Los Angeles Dodgers, with their $314 million payroll, are learning what the Yankees learned a decade or so ago: You can’t buy championships. Speaking of the Dodgers, Chase Utley’s slide into second base was not dirty baseball. It’s called October baseball. It’s unfortunate a leg was broken in the play, but if fielders get the “neighborhood play” in their favor, the runners should too. To a point, anyway. World Series pick: The Chicago Cubs beat the Toronto Blue Jays in five games. It’s interesting to see fiction unfold into possible reality with the 1989 movie Back to the Future II predicting the Cubs would win the Series in 2015. But is it really that much of a stretch? The movie also predicted that the Cubs would beat Miami in the Series, but an MLB team in Miami wouldn’t arrive for another four years (1993). Score one, so far, for the screenwriter. Is more better? When I was a kid, I had three or four college football games on Saturdays from which to choose. Yesterday, there were 21 games on our TV list for the day. The USC vs. Notre Dame game is great, but Tulsa at East Carolina? South Florida at UConn? I’d rather do yardwork. Chavez is the Daily Messenger’s sports editor.
