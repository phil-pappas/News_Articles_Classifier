Na played the closing stretch with an eagle and a birdie for a 64.\nThe PGA Tour season opener is wide open going into the final round with 16 players separated by only four shots.\nSteele was at 14-under 202 as he tried to go wire-to-wire and pick up his second PGA Tour victory.\nHe could have made it easier on himself over the closing holes. Steele couldn't get up-and-down from a bunker on the par-5 16th. His tee shot was slightly pulled and bounced out of a tree back to the fairway and short of the green on the 296-yard 17th hole, and he could get no closer than 20 feet with a wedge on the par-5 18th.\nLPGA: Lydia Ko and Sung Hyun Park rebounded to top the crowded leaderboard in the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship. In position to take the top spot in the world, the second-ranked Ko overcame a double bogey with two late birdies in a 3-under 69. Park bounced back from a second-round 74 with a 67 to match Ko at 13 under 203 on Sky 72's Ocean Course. American Lexi Thompson and South Korea's Mirim Lee each birdied the 18th to pull within a stroke of the lead. Thompson had a 69, and Lee shot 67.\nChampions: Defending champion Michael Allen shot a 3-under 69 for a share of the lead with Scott McCarron in the San Antonio Championship. McCarron also had a 69 to reach 6-under 138 on TPC San Antonio's AT&T Canyons Course. Fred Couples was a stroke back along with Bernhard Langer , Scott Dunlap and first-round leader Wes Short Jr. Couples shot 69, Langer 68, Dunlap 71 and Short 72.\nAustralasia PGA: American Matt Kuchar shot a 3-under 69 to maintain a two-stroke lead in the wind-swept Fiji International. Kuchar had a 1-under 215 total at Natadolo Bay in the event sanctioned by the OneAsia and Australasian tours. Australia's Aron Price was second after a 69. Fiji's Vijay Singh was nine shots back after a 71.\nEuropean PGA: England's Andy Sullivan shot a 4-under 67 to take a five-shot lead in the Portugal Masters.\nAsian PGA: Australia's Scott Hend had two eagles in a 7-under 64 to take a three-stroke lead over defending champion Anirban Lahiri of India in the Macao Open.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/62/8809620/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/62/8809620/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:20:36.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
