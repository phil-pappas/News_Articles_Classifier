(AP) - Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs Jr. says he's inviting the city's firefighters to a meeting that will be closed to their chief, the aldermen and the media.\nThe Vicksburg Post reports ( http://bit.ly/1RvKQMi ) Flaggs sent a letter to firefighters, saying he will be available for two hours Saturday at the City Hall annex to discuss issues in the Fire Department.\nAmong other things, the department has experienced problems with short-staffing and a big overtime budget.\nFlaggs says there has been \"a disconnect in the communication\" between firefighters and himself.\nChief Charles Atkins says he's disappointed Flaggs would exclude him and others from the meeting. The chief says he previously asked the mayor to communicate through him to the firefighters. Atkins says it appears Flaggs doesn't trust him to do that.\nInformation from: The Vicksburg Post, http://www.vicksburgpost.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1RvKQMi"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:53:49.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
