That is the only time the event has been held outside England or Scotland. \nThe push to bring the Open back to Northern Ireland gained momentum after three players from country — Graeme McDowell, Darren Clarke and Rory McIlroy — won majors since 2010. McIlroy is now a four-time major champion and one of the world’s best players. \nThe R&A said last year that Royal Portrush was returning to the Open rotation, but didn’t give a year and said there would be logistical challenges to get the venue in shape. \nThe Dunluce course has been given the first available slot on the calendar. \n“Royal Portrush is one of my favorite golf courses in the world,” said McIlroy, the British Open champion in 2014. “I think it will be a fantastic Open venue.” \nThe R&A said it is expected to be the biggest sporting event ever held in Northern Ireland, and Northern Irish lawmakers predicted an economic boost of 70 million pounds ($108 million). \nRoyal Portrush held an extremely successful Irish Open in 2012, attracting some 130,000 fans for the week. It has also held the Senior British Open six times. \nWork to create two new holes — Nos. 7 and 8 — on the Dunluce Links is underway, using land from the adjacent Valley Course to develop a new par-5 hole. Those new holes will replace the current 17th and 18th holes, freeing up land to be used to accommodate the spectator village and other infrastructure. \nThe length of the course will increase by just less than 200 yards to 7,337 yards, and the number of bunkers will be increased by three to 62. That still leaves Royal Portrush with the fewest bunkers of any of the courses on the British Open rotation. \n“We are delighted with the progress being made on the course preparations and they will undoubtedly enhance the challenge presented by these historic links,” said Peter Unsworth, chairman of the R&A’s championship committee.
