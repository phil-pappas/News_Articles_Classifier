Hojai has been rewarded for the role he played in helping the party to lure nine elected members of the council, including eight from the ruling Congress, earlier this month. Hojai was elected the CEM in the voting held yesterday at Haflong headquarters of the district council, defeating his Congress rival Mohendra Kemprai. He used to be one of the most wanted militant leaders who headed the now disbanded Dima Halam Daogah (J) as its self-styled commander-in-chief. He was accused in a Rs 1,000-crore scam in Dima Hasao Council. The DHD(J) signed a memorandum of settlement (MoS) with the Centre in 2010 and the outfit was disbanded. Hojai and other senior leaders of the outfit were released on bail before signing of the MoS. He contested elections to the district council as an Independent candidate in May 2013 and joined the BJP in 2014. Hojai reportedly played a key role in facilitating the floor-crossing by nine council members to the BJP camp on October 16 that virtually paved the way for the BJP to capture power in the hill council. In the last election to the district council on May 20, 2013, the Congress won 10 seats while the remaining went to the Independents. The BJP drew a blank in the elections. Six Independents joined the Congress to give the party a majority to form the executive council on May 28, 2013. Three more Independents also joined the Congress on a later date. The hill district council has 28 elected and two nominated members. Though the BJP did not win a single seat in the council elections, Independent Subrata Thaosen joined the party in April, 2014. Six other Independents followed suit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:47.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
