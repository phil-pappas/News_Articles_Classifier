The last few years I've been really distanced. \n\"I'm still in the finance world, advising lots of European clubs from a financial point of view, balance sheets, restructuring. There are people who have an interest in getting this sorted out in a manner where tranquility and stability can follow. \n\"You need a nuclear scenario, a clean break from the past.\" \nVega clearly believes that does not involve Platini, who could be barred from running for the FIFA presidency depending on the exact length of his suspension. \nVega told the newspaper: \"The block that has been happening through the Platini scenario has not allowed a debate to develop. \n\"He needs to stand back, put his hands up and concentrate on retaining the UEFA job. At the moment the governing body of UEFA has the potential to put forward a good candidate and it is being blocked through loyalty to Platini. \n\"There is nothing wrong with loyalty, but it has to go hand in hand with common sense.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:44.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
