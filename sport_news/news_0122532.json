One of the best, and maybe more underrated deals was the acquisition of Morgan Schneiderlin from Southampton. Schneiderlin’s addition boosts a midfield that sometimes needs depth, as Bastian Schweinsteiger and Michael Carrick have recently had a tendency to suffer a knock or too, and miss time. \nScoring is not Schneiderlin’s primary function, but when he does provide a goal, it certainly is an added boost. It’s like finding money you didn’t know you had in the pockets of your pants. \nSchneiderlin scored in his very first appearance in a United shirt this preseason (here’s footage of that). Today, however, brought his first goal in meaningful game action, as United crushed Everton 3-0. Schneiderlin provided the first scoring strike in the 18′ here’s the footage: Manchester United's first goal vs Everton Schneiderlin's 1st goal for Manchester United pic.twitter.com/KXi7z9GLaN \n— Semper Fi United (@SemperFiUnited) October 17, 2015 Here’s what Morgan Schneiderlin Tweeted from his official account to recognize the occasion: Great win & great performance from the team !
