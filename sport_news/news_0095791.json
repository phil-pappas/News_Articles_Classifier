Scores of tired baseball writers were contemplating a couple of hours’ sleep before boarding hastily arranged flights to Kansas City. And everywhere you turned, the conversation was the same. \nThat game. And that seventh inning, bizarre and bewildering, obnoxious and glorious, the best and worst of baseball by turns. A 53-minute cliffhanger of an inning, with a dramatic denouement still to come. \n“It was a fitting ending,” said manager John Gibbons. \n“Like a novel,” said R.A. Dickey. \nOn late-night talk shows in the U.S., they were talking about that game, in which the Jays beat the Rangers by the deceptively prosaic score of 6-3 to advance to the American League Championship Series against Kansas City. \nAnd they were talking about the Jose Bautista home run that provided the victory margin, and whether Bautista deserved glory or censure for flipping his bat – OK, not just flipping it, but whipping it skyward with a ferocity uncommon even for Bautista – and shooting a glare of supreme smugness at the opposing pitcher. According to baseball’s antediluvian customs, Bautista not only crossed the line of propriety but triple-jumped over it, heaping gratuitous insult on an opponent who had just given him a pitch to hit 442 feet into a roaring crowd. \nAnd then there was that play. The one nobody, including the umpires, had ever seen before, at least in the big leagues. But Texas manager Jeff Banister, who was a longtime catcher, had seen it in the minors. Like Toronto’s Russ Martin, Banister had once tried to throw a ball back to his pitcher and saw it bounce off a hitter’s bat. He knew the rule. \nYou know how it played out, how the score was 2-2 in the seventh inning, and how the Rangers took the lead after Martin tried to throw the ball back to Aaron Sanchez and it hit Shin-Soo Choo’s bat. As it dribbled onto the infield, Rougned Odor scooted home from third base. Plate ump Dale Scott sent him back, and out came Banister. Ultimately, after a series of meetings among the umpires and a check with the supreme court of umpires in New York, the run stood. \nThe Jays declared that they were filing an official protest. Many in the crowd of 50,000 had already done so, via their howls, profane chants and, in the case of a few Neanderthal types in the upper decks, by hurling various projectiles, including cans of beer, onto the field and upon fans sitting in the lower bowl. \nIt often happens in baseball that no one explains to the fans why a play is called a certain way on the field, and so it was again. This was an obscure rule, applied in a critical situation in an elimination game, and no one understood what was going on. The umpires deepened the confusion by listening to one manager, huddling, listening to another, huddling again, listening to a very angry Troy Tulowitzki and huddling again. The umpires held more meetings in that seventh inning than a parliamentary committee does during a session of the House of Commons. \nThe more the umpires conferred, the more the fans’ anger grew. Those on the concourses could see replays of Martin’s throw on TV, and couldn’t make sense of what happened. In the press box, reporters desperately searched the internet for an explanation. It seemed to make no sense. \nBecause the rule, of course, does not make sense. The ball is in play when a hitter unintentionally holds his bat so that it happens to interrupt the flight of the catcher’s return throw? No one was trying to make a play. Scott’s instinct was logical: no play, dead ball. Perhaps no one except Jeff Banister would have questioned that. Then Scott also remembered the rule and had to apply it, nonsensical though it might be. \nWhich, given the mood of the angriest and drunkest fans, might well have led to riots in the stadium and in the streets had the 3-2 score held up and the Rangers ousted the Jays from the playoffs on a technicality. \nFortunately for the Jays, and for everyone’s safety, the Texas defence collapsed in spectacular fashion in the bottom of the inning, leading to Bautista’s historic home-run histrionics and his team’s astounding resurrection in the series. \nThose are the moments that are seared into fans’ collective memory. So many other little monuments made this a game for the ages. The three youngest Toronto pitchers – Marcus Stroman (24), Aaron Sanchez (22) and Roberto Osuna (20) carried the torch through nine innings. Behind them, Toronto’s defence was superb. The Jays, a team of remarkable tenacity, patience and composure, pounced on Texas mistakes – the fastball Edwin Encarnacion hit into the seats off the otherwise brilliant Cole Hamels, and the four fielding blunders that set up Bautista’s blast. \nWhat a crazy game last night!!! #bluejay fans y'all were rocking!! Unreal job by my guys @MStrooo6 @A_Sanch41 \n— David Price (@DAVIDprice14) \nWhen the Jays went to Texas down 0-2, manager John Gibbons received a text and then a visit from Joe Torre, the former Yankees manager who now works as MLB’s vice-president of baseball. \n“Joe came up to me, he had texted me, (and said) this isn’t insurmountable, because he did it with the Yankees,” Gibbons said. “He said, hey, take it one day at a time. Great advice. Easier said than done, of course. … Coming from him, it’s kind of a comforting thing.” \nSo Toronto beat Texas three straight. Canada rejoiced. And now, Joe Torre won’t have to rule on that protest the Jays filed in the seventh inning of one of the weirdest, wildest and greatest playoff games ever. \nThanks to all the fans for the support, last night was for you! \n— Roberto Osuna (@RobertoOsuna1) October 15, 2015 © Copyright (c)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:22:28.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
