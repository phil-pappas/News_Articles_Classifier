Comment Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 12:00 PM Updated Oct 1, 2015 at 12:23 PM By Chris Steele Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 12:00 PM Updated Oct 1, 2015 at 12:23 PM Randy Russell accomplished a lot on the grass at Bob Reade Field during his football career. However, when the Geneseo Alumni football team takes the field on Oct. 10 against Sterling, Russell will add another special moment to his Green Machine legacy — stepping onto the field with his family. “When I heard about it, I got a hold of my kids and my brother (Robert),” said Randy Russell, a 1979 Geneseo graduate. “I thought it would really be neat to have all of us all out there at one time.” A linebacker who was a part of three state championship teams, Randy Russell will be joined by his brother, Robert, and his three sons: Neil, his oldest (1999 graduate), Curtis (2004 graduate) and youngest, Shaun (2006 graduate). “What’s neat is a small town like (Geneseo) has a winning tradition and kept it going,” Randy Russell said. “People are proud they played for Geneseo and want to come back out and do it again.” With a football program sustaining a level of excellence throughout it’s history, the Geneseo Alumni football game has had no shortage of players ready to relive their playing days. A member of the Air Force, Curtis Russell has been trying to make arrangements to come to the game. Neil Russell, who played wingback for the Green Machine, looks forward to old memories flooding back once Geneseo takes the field. “You are born into the football tradition in Geneseo,” Neil said. “It stays with you. It’s a part of growing up. As a kid, you go to the Friday night games. It’s a part of being brought up, and wanting to be a part of something special.” With the game open to all Geneseo Alumni, Green Machine players from all generations get a chance to line up together. “I’m getting to know guys I never got to play with,” Shaun Russell said. “Growing up, I looked up to a few of them who are out there from my oldest brother’s class. It’s fun to get to know them and see them out on the field with you. They are going to be busting heads just like we all are.” Allowing the Russell family members to have their special moment together as a part of the Green Machine football family.
