They are very good in transitions from defence to attack, so we have to use the ball well and finish our attacks.” \nOn top of an opponent in a rich vein of form, Madrid will have to cope with a raft of injuries for the trip to Vigo. \nGareth Bale, Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez, Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Pepe are all doubtful, whilst Dani Carvajal is definitely out. \nDespite missing so many key players, Madrid still managed a creditable 0-0 draw away to Paris Saint-Germain in midweek. \n“We are not at our best due to the absences, but we need to look forward,” said Madrid captain Sergio Ramos. \n“We can't conform nor make excuses. We have a big squad with players that are desperate to show what they can do.” \nJese Rodriguez and Lucas Vazquez were handed rare starts at the Parc des Princes and Rafael Benitez could be left with no other option but to field the youngsters again if Bale and Benzema don't recover in time. \n“Jese and Lucas showed they have the level to compete and help us improve as a team,” added Ramos. \nIniesta back for Barca \nBarcelona have a much easier task on paper when they host Basque minnows Eibar at the Camp Nou on Sunday. \nThe European champions' own injury crisis has been eased by the return of Andres Iniesta. However, midfielder Sergi Roberto has been ruled out for 10 days with a groin strain and four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi misses out once more due to knee ligament damage. \nNeymar has stepped up in Messi's absence - scoring four against Rayo Vallecano last weekend and providing both assists for Ivan Rakitic in Tuesday's 2-0 win away at BATE Borisov. \nYet, Javier Mascherano believes there is a lot more to come from the Catalans. \n“I think it is clear we are not at the best level we can be. The team is aware of that, we can give a lot more,” he said. \n“By working hard and above all correcting the errors defensively and offensively it is the first step to get to the level we want.” \nEibar were only sparred of relegation last season due to Elche's financial troubles sending them down to the second division. \nHowever, the side from a town of just 27,000 people have made a great start to just their second season in the top flight having suffered just one defeat in their opening eight games. \nThere is a clash between two of Spain's five Champions League participants on Sunday as Atletico Madrid welcome Valencia to the Vicente Calderon. \nAtletico sit just two points off the top and will be able to welcome back a host of first team regulars who were rested by Diego Simeone for Wednesday's 4-0 win over Kazak champions Astana. \nMeanwhile, former Manchester United manager David Moyes is under huge pressure to get a result when his Real Sociedad side visit fellow strugglers Levante. \nSociedad remain out of the relegation zone only on goal difference and a third consecutive defeat could see the Scot's time in Spain brought to a premature end. \nFixtures (all times GMT) — today \nRayo Vallecano v Espanyol (1830) \nTomorrow \nCelta Vigo v Real Madrid (1400), Granada v Real Betis (1615), Sevilla v Getafe (1830), Malaga v Deportivo la Coruna (2005) \nSunday \nLevante v Real Sociedad (1000), Las Palmas v Villarreal (1400), Barcelona v Eibar (1615), Atletico Madrid v Valencia (1830) \nMonday \nAthletic Bilbao v Sporting Gijon (1830) — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:13:28.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
