This is why I made my choice. I submit my resignation,” he wrote.\nThe expenses were just the tip of the iceberg for Marino. For months, questions have swirled around the mayor’s competence as the city appeared to be crumbling before everyone’s eyes. Rubbish was left uncollected , the grass was not mowed in public parks, and the huge Mafia Capitale scandal involving corruption in public sector contracts – which did not implicate Marino personally – resulted in the arrests of dozens of city officials.\nAnother low point for the former liver transplant surgeon came last week, when Pope Francis took a swipe at the mayor for his decision to come to Philadelphia to see him during his trip to the US, even though he had not been invited by the Vatican.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pro-Marino demonstrator holds a placard reading ‘Marino resist’ during a rally outside Rome’s city hall.

The special year of jubilee, the Vatican event that will attract millions of tourists over the next 12 months, begins on 8 December.\nA prank call by a radio station to a senior Vatican official last week revealed that the church did not have confidence in Marino’s ability to manage the influx of tourists.\nFor months, it looked like Marino could survive a general feeling of dissatisfaction with his performance because it seemed unlikely that the PD would cut him lose. Matteo Renzi , the Italian prime minister and head of the PD, had distanced himself from Marino and even questioned his competence, but seemed loth to risk an election that could turn the management of the city over to a competing party, including the Five Star Movement.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tourists stand in front of the Spanish Steps in Rome, which are closed to the public for restoration.

On Wednesday night Marino pledged to pay back €20,000 (£15,000) in claimed expenses after it was alleged that he had used the funds to take his wife and friends out for dinners. “They were expenses that were made in the interests of Rome,” Marino wrote on his Facebook page.\nBut his response was not good enough for even his political allies. Marino had released his expenses online to respond to critics who said he was travelling too much.\nIn one case, he claimed to be dining with an official at the World Health Organisation, but that was revealed to be false by La Repubblica. The owner of the restaurant told the daily newspaper that he remembered seeing Marino and that he had been there eating with his wife.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Rome%20mayor%20resigns%20amid%20expenses%20scandal&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d62v%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Rome%20mayor%20resigns%20amid%20expenses%20scandal&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d62v%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0602ba537ba2a3a89d3ee540c09126a601bb5d8/0_0_5469_3279/master/5469.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=db01ae5259559a60b2debb1b50a2417c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0602ba537ba2a3a89d3ee540c09126a601bb5d8/0_0_5469_3279/master/5469.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=e6cea6865786f1a6a66eb476a0cca456", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3697cc6338df8365b114020b7e99d5e00613502c/0_76_3987_2390/master/3987.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0aecee1b807241858c5c379c0fa98198", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d62v%2Fsfb%23img-3&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d62v&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F3697cc6338df8365b114020b7e99d5e00613502c%2F0_76_3987_2390%2F3987.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0602ba537ba2a3a89d3ee540c09126a601bb5d8/0_0_5469_3279/master/5469.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ec33bab3527616f10853f2f5d411a8df", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0602ba537ba2a3a89d3ee540c09126a601bb5d8/0_0_5469_3279/master/5469.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=416719437da7d4ffb3871f95ba80cae4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3697cc6338df8365b114020b7e99d5e00613502c/0_76_3987_2390/master/3987.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=8c182e953e724baf12b8ad852da520fe", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d62v%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d62v&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ff0602ba537ba2a3a89d3ee540c09126a601bb5d8%2F0_0_5469_3279%2F5469.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Rome+mayor+resigns+amid+expenses+scandal&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Foct%2F08%2Frome-mayor-resigns-amid-expenses-scandal-ignazio-marino&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ff0602ba537ba2a3a89d3ee540c09126a601bb5d8%2F0_0_5469_3279%2F5469.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Rome+mayor+resigns+amid+expenses+scandal&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Foct%2F08%2Frome-mayor-resigns-amid-expenses-scandal-ignazio-marino&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F3697cc6338df8365b114020b7e99d5e00613502c%2F0_76_3987_2390%2F3987.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3697cc6338df8365b114020b7e99d5e00613502c/0_76_3987_2390/master/3987.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=2d2a1b58c26146a6e1446f091e1a34e8", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3697cc6338df8365b114020b7e99d5e00613502c/0_76_3987_2390/master/3987.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=3a8dedb6e545e4ed456bc410ef7576d0"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:29:49.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
