(File photo)\n MADISON â€” Terricka Cromartie, the wife of Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie, is scheduled to make her first court appearance Wednesday afternoon in Madison Municipal Court on charges of using a cell phone while driving and having tinted windows.\nCromartie, who was stopped by Madison police on Sept. 25, took to Instagram after the incident and said she was \"pulled over for driving black in Madison.\"\nShe claimed she had been stopped for no reason, asked to roll down her windows and asked why she was in Madison.\nShe posted both a video of the officer talking to her and her own comments, but she later took down the video. The tickets were obtained later by NJ Advance Media through an Open Public Records Act request.\nMadison police told NJ Advance Media on Wednesday the tickets were issued at the time of the traffic stop.\nRELATED: Wife discussed alleged incident on social media The racial allegations are not part of the case in the municipal court. On Sept. 28, Madison Police Chief Darren Dachisen issued a statement saying he had referred those allegations to \"the proper county authority, as per the New Jersey Attorney General guidelines.\"\nPolice have not specified which county authority to which the case was referred, but a public records request by NJ Advance Media for dashcam video related to the traffic stop was denied pending \"an ongoing internal investigation by the Morris County Prosecutor's Office.\"\nDachisen has said the department \"discovered\" Cromartie's complaint \"through a media inquiry and social media\" and then referred it to the county agency. The statement also told of the two traffic violations against Cromartie.\nCromartie, 33, listed a Kinnelon address. Her court appearance is scheduled for 5 p.m.\nMadison's municipal prosecutor, Maryann O'Donnell McCoy, confirmed late Tuesday afternoon that Cromartie's case was on her calendar for Wednesday, but said it was not clear whether she had retained a lawyer.\nCromartie could not be reached for comment. Her husband has declined to talk about her profiling allegations.\nBen Horowitz may be reached at bhorowitz@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @HorowitzBen .
