Terrence Romeo of Gilas Pilipinas will be a marked man when the Filipinos take on Lebanon in a knockout-style quarterfinals today. \nThe Group E top-seeded Gilas Pilipinas will lock horns with the dangerous Lebanese squad, which finished at No. 4 in Group F, in the nightcap at 9:45 p.m. today at the CSWC Gymnasium in Changsa, China with the winner earning a spot in the Final Four. \nPrior to the Philippines-Lebanon tiff, the other knockout quarters games features Iran against South Korea, which clash at 2:30 p.m., followed by the tussle between Japan and Qatar at 4:45 p.m. and the still unbeaten host China and India at 7:30 p.m. \nThe winner between the Philippines and Lebanon will face the winner in the Japan-Qatar tilt. \nAfter a shock opening-loss in its opening game in the tournament against Palestine, Gilas went on an impressive surge by winning its next five games on its way to claiming the group’s top seeding going into the quarterfinals. \nThe Filipinos, who finished the classification rounds with a 4-1 slate, had been playing exceptional basketball as the fluidity of Coach Tab Baldwin’s wards on both ends of the floor had given them satisfying results. \nDespite all the confidence and momentum on their side, however, Baldwin knows that the toughest games loom ahead for the nationals, including this one against Lebanon. \n“Now all the games are tough. All the opponents are tough,’’ said Baldwin. \nThe Kiwi-American national coach expects his dribblers to continue what they’ve been doing in the past five games. \n“We have to be ready and bring it all together,’’ he said. ‘’We need to keep working as a team which is what we’re really supposed to do.’’ \nIn contrast to the relatively easy path of the Gilas team, Lebanon had to get past the proverbial eye of the needle to make it through. \nLebanon scrambled to beat Jordan, 80-76, on Tuesday, to finish at 2-3 and take the last last remaining slot in the quarters. \nThe Philippines is understandably favored in today’s match, but Baldwin said the nationals won’t be taking Lebanon lightly.
