The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association voted Wednesday afternoon 26 to 4 to expand from four classifications to six in many sports.\"It's almost become a no brainer. We're increasing participation for student athletes. So you can't go wrong with that,\" Melissa Mertz, associate executive director with the PIAA said. \nSome leagues, though, expressed concerns such as time, and the cost of travel - not to mention the end of some fierce rivalries. In the end, the support was overwhelming.\"Schools are going to find they're more in line with schools that are of comparable size. Also with the number of schools they have in that district, what it does is gives some schools a better chance at competing and now qualifying for playoffs because they're not competing against the large schools they had in the past,\" Mertz said.Approved at the PIAA meeting Thursday was moving football from four classifications to six classifications. Basketball, softball and baseball were also moved from four to six classifications.The PIAA also voted to expand girls volleyball and boys and girls soccer from three to four classifications; field hockey up to three classifications and lacrosse to two classifications.All changes with expanded classes will begin in the 2016-17 school year.At Wednesday night's junior varsity football game between Northern York and Carlisle, parent Travis Myers likes what the future holds for his son. \n\"I think it's good for the kids. It gives them an opportunity to compete and play more,\" he said.Spectators like Kevin Reyes say an expanded class is a good thing for player development. \n\"It improves their skill level and they get to play other teams they haven't played in a while. New schools is better,\" he said.School districts are to submit their pupil numbers by Oct. 15, at which time those numbers will be used to set the classifications for athletics.
