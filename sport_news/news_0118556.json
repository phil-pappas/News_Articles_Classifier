It appears that more and more colleges are looking to generate extra revenue for their athletic programs at football games by letting the alcohol flow more freely inside the stadium once the pregame tailgating is over.\nSome 36 Division I schools are currently selling alcohol in some capacity. Included are seven of the eight schools in the Big East .\nWhen West Virginia made a decision in June to sell beer in two general concession areas at Mountaineer Field , it left Rutgers as the lone holdout in the conference. Scarlet Knights AD Tim Pernetti admitted his school is taking a long look at that option for the 2012 season.\n\"The trend 10 years ago was the opposite of what it is now,\" Pernetti claimed, noting that schools like West Virginia, which averaged 56,376 at home games, stand to make between $500,000 and $1.2 million from alcohol sales and additional revenue in sponsorship deals from brand names seeking to own the rights.\nThe NCAA has always taken a hard line on this subject, suggesting alcohol and undergraduates can be a toxic mix. The NCAA has gone out of its way to promote responsible drinking and bans all alcohol and signage at the championship events it controls.\nBut the universities control on-campus regular season games, and the universities have no control over what municipal stadiums do at games played at their sites.\nWest Virginia University 's board of governors approved AD Oliver Luck 's plans to allow concession operator Sodexo - which sells beer in general concession areas at four on-campus stadiums and in private suite and club sections of 20 college venues - to sell beer until the halfway point of the third quarter. But Luck was also instructed to monitor the new practice for problems and report back within a year. West Virginia has served beer in privately-owned suites since 1994.\nBeer will be sold in plastic bottles - not cups - to minimize spills, and no one will be allowed to hawk beers in the stands. Luck said fans can buy only two beers at a time and that trained vendors may use discretion to cut off overly-intoxicated customers.\nLuck also told the board he was ending a longstanding \"pass out\" rule that allowed fans to leave during day games, drink heavily and then return to the stadium, claiming in a prepared statement that WVU had taken a step forward toward a goal of \"a safer, friendlier and more civil game-day experience.\"\nWest Virginia has always had a history as a hard-drinking party school where tailgate parties in the past looked like bars and students developed a crazy habit for burning couches after the Mountaineers won a big game.\nMost Big East schools restrict alcohol sales. But Louisville, which plays its home games at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium , also sells hard liquor such as bourbon.\nIn contrast, the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference will not allow any of their member schools to sell alcohol in general concession areas inside stadiums, although the University of Maryland will be selling beer for the first time in the high-end luxury suites at Byrd Stadium this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:26:26.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
