During the show, Francesa revealed that there would be a “30 for 30” special on the “Mike and the Mad Dog” show formerly hosted by Francesa and longtime radio partner Chris Russo. \n“I’ll give a scoop here. And I have not done anything with ESPN for years, but I have agreed to a 30 for 30 on ‘Mike & the Mad Dog.’ I agreed to do it because everyone asked me to. Dog really wanted it,” Francesa said. \n30 for 30 is the documentary-style franchise Simmons launched at ESPN, leading Simmons to say that Francesa was killing him by working with his former company. \n“Are you trying to kill me?” Simmons said exasperated. \nFrancesa and Chris Russo teamed up at WFAN in New York from 1989-2008 to form one of the most respected sports talk radio shows in the country. They were their own institution and had their radio show simulcast on TV. \nThough Francesa remained at WFAN while Russo moved on and founded “Mad Dog” radio at SiriusXM, the Pope says he would not be against a reunion. The only problem? There wouldn’t be enough money to pay them both. \n“The problem with the reunion is that there is nobody that can afford that show anymore,” Francesa explained to Simmons. “Dog and I would have to agree to get paid much less than we are now because of the economy. The business has changed.” \nThough the program was local and broadcast in New York, the availability of the show through the YES Network helped “Mike and the Mad Dog” reach a national audience. You better believe this program is going to do huge ratings.
