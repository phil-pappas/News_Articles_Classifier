(Miami-Dade Department of Corrections via AP) Sponsored Links The Associated Press DAVIE, Fla. â€” \nMiami Dolphins cornerback Brent Grimes says he's concentrating on football in the wake of his wife's arrest outside the stadium before the team's most recent game. \nMiko Grimes is scheduled for arraignment Oct. 27 on charges of disorderly conduct, battery on a police officer and resisting arrest with violence. She was arrested Sunday while walking in the stadium parking lot, and police say she disobeyed an officer's command to stop, became combative and head-butted an officer. \n\"Miko is fine,\" Grimes said Wednesday, talking publicly about the incident for the first time. \"I really don't want to talk about Miko. That will handle itself.\" \nWhen asked if the matter was a distraction for him, Grimes said no. \n\"I'm good. Stuff will happen, but you have to focus on your job,\" he said. \nThe Dolphins will try to bounce back from a 41-14 loss to Buffalo when they play Sunday against the Jets in London. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n___ \nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:47:08.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
