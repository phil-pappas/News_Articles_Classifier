The postmaster has also been directed to pay interest for the period from September 18, 2014, till the closure of the account on the investment of Rs 9 lakh under the Monthly Income Scheme (MIS) to the complainant. The complainant, P Ram, a resident of Sector 21, stated in his complaint to the forum that after retirement, he, along with his wife, made investments with the post office in Sector 19. They invested Rs 9 lakh in the account under the MIS on June 18, 2010, and also invested Rs 15 lakh in the Senior Citizen Saving Scheme Account of the post office on October 5, 2010. It is averred that the complainant had to close the said accounts prematurely on October 13, 2014, and October 10, 2014, respectively, due to some urgent need of money. However, the post office denied interest payable on the investment of Rs 9 lakh for the period from September 18, 2014, till the date of the closure of the account under the pretext that no interest was payable for a period less than one month. It is also averred that no written reasoning was given in this regard. It was pleaded that in the other account No. 297201, which was also prematurely closed, the interest for a period less than one month was allowed by the post office. In the order, the consumer court, presided over by president Rajan Dewan and comprising members Jaswinder Singh Sidhu and Priti Malhotra, stated that the post office misconceived the rules and interpreted these in their own way. The post office stated in its reply that the complainant was also informed along with a copy of the instructions issued by the government, wherein it was specifically provided that the interest shall be payable monthly to the depositor on completion of the month in case of the MIS, which implied that interest could not be paid for the number of days. “We are of the opinion that the post office tried to interpret the above provision as per its convenience, which is not favourable to the complainant in question. The provisions do not bestow any right to the post office to retain the interest payable for the proceedings days before the closure of the account. There is nothing on record to state that if the money is paid prior to the completion of a month, the interest for that month is not payable. In our view, the provisions referred above only indicate the frequency of payment of interest and nowhere indicate specifically that no interest shall be payable for a period less than one month. The post office, while denying the claim of the complainant, relied upon the same rules as appended by both parties, but with a different interpretation,” said the forum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:19:55.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
