Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City's 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4.

He was given a rare playoff ejection for arguing balls and strikes before the top of the eighth. \nTulowitzki, who struck out looking in the seventh, was restrained by teammates as he argued with plate umpire John Hirschbeck when the Blue Jays took the field for the eighth. Gibbons and bench coach DeMarlo Hale also came out to break it up.

Ben Zobrist drove in Escobar with a grounder, but that was the only advantage Kanas City would hold in having its nine-game ALCS winning streak snapped. The string dated to the 1985 series against Toronto. \nBlue Jays center fielder Kevin Pillar quashed that rally with a fantastic, over-the-shoulder catch that sent him crashing into the wall.

Eleven of his remaining 13 batters reached and at one point in the third inning he threw his hands up in frustration after gesturing for a new cycle of signs from catcher Salvador Perez. \nGoins singled in two runs in the second after Tulowitzki singled with one out and Russell Martin was hit by a pitch that knocked off his left elbow guard. Goins pulled into second on the throw home and shouted and pumped his arms. \nDavid Price, the losing pitcher in Game 2, led the cheering from the top step of the dugout. \nWhen Goins scored on Donaldson's hit, he was greeted first by the enthusiastic Stroman.

But he connected for the Blue Jays' first ALCS homer after Edwin Encarnacion singled and Chris Colabello walked to start the third. \n\"Battling with the shoulder at times, but trying to gut it out,\" Tulowitzki said. \nCueto was coming off a dominant eight-inning performance in Game 5 of the ALDS, retiring his last 19 batters. But after giving up Pillar's RBI double in the third, he was done.

(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT (Frank Gunn/AP) \nThe dreadlocked Dominican gave up six hits and eight runs in two-plus innings. He walked four and hit a batter with a pitch. As fans sang Cueto off the field, he smiled and tossed his gum near the Royals dugout. \nDonaldson connected two batters after Kris Medlen entered for a 9-2 lead, and Goins homered off Medlen in the fifth as Toronto matched its postseason best with three homers in a game. The Blue Jays also hit three against Texas in Game 4 of the ALDS. \nStroman gave up two runs in the fifth on a wild pitch and an RBI single in an uncharacteristic performance for the 24-year-old who returned from a torn knee ligament in March to go 4-0 down the stretch and get the win in Game 5 of the ALDS. He allowed four runs and 11 hits. \nBut many Blue Jays fans were confident enough with a 10-4 lead to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to Bautista when he came to bat in the sixth. Bautista drove in a run in the eighth. \nUP NEXT \nThe bookish Young, a Princeton grad, and Dickey, who has talked about his desire to be a teacher, were twice teammates, with Texas (2003-04) and the Mets (2011-12). Young hasn't started since Oct. 2, but pitched in relief in Game 1 of the Division Series. Dickey was lifted with two outs in the fifth against Texas in the Division Series with Toronto leading by six runs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:44:59.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
