We have to be prepared for the double passes. They got an opportunity to play Penn State and get a win that's really important to them, and I could see them doing whatever they have to do to get it. \n\"So fake punts, onside kicks, trick plays on offense, shot plays . . . They're going to look at some of the things Ohio State did last week and we need to be prepared for them. They have a mobile quarterback. I could just see them coming in and being really aggressive and taking some calculated risks.\" \nThe \"mobile quarterback\" is Perry Hills, a 6-foot-2, 210-pound junior, who rushed for 170 yards - a season high for a Big Ten quarterback - two weeks ago against Ohio State. \nLocksley said his primary focus since Edsall's firing has been on his players and their mind-sets. \n\"The thing that we really stress is to have fun and play football in its purist form,\" he said. \"It's back in the day when you'd go out and play with your friends in the backyard and you just let it all cut loose. That's the kind of mentality we want to play with because we really have nothing to lose as a program.\" \nBoth teams are ranked in the top 10 nationally in sacks, Penn State second with 27, Maryland ninth with 20. The Terps allow more than 260 passing yards per game but the Lions threw it only 13 times last week in their 38-10 loss at Ohio State. \nSpecial teams could be an issue. Penn State's punting is inconsistent. Maryland's William Likely is second in the nation at 22 yards per punt return, with two touchdowns. \nWhile it's nice that two friends will be coaching against each other, Locksley wants the focus to be on the players. \n\"It's not about James,\" he said. \"It's about our players competing against Penn State. I know our players are really excited about the opportunity.\" Recruit decommits \nPenn State has lost the first commitment to its freshman Class of 2016. Offensive tackle Christian Colon of Charlotte, N.C., announced Thursday night on Twitter that he would re-open his recruitment. \nThe 6-foot-3, 303-pound Colon, a three-star recruit who gave Penn State coach James Franklin an oral commitment on June 25, said in a statement that his decommitment came \"after much thought and careful consideration.\" \nColon's change of heart means Penn State now has 19 commitments for 2016. The Nittany Lions are ranked fourth in the nation in recruiting by Scout, 247Sports and ESPN.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:32:14.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
