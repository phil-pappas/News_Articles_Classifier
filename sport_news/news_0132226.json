I know him as a brother, and he’s really the anchor of the team, mentally.”\nAfter a break, Monette walked onto the court once again to take on Eduardo Mena of Tennessee Tech for the singles championship.\n“There was very little time to prepare for another win,” Monette said. “So I used the momentum from the doubles match and the momentum created by the rest of the guys to motivate me through the match.”\nMonette only allowed Mena four set points throughout the two-set match, winning 6-1, 6-3.\nDespite the championship victories, Monette said the tournaments aren’t very significant for the season.\n“The goal in these tournaments is to just get ready for the season,” Monette said. “It’s nothing compared to the season.”\nWhile most of the team will travel to play in the Wake Forest Invitational Nov. 6 through Nov. 8, Monette and Bednarczyk qualified for the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships Nov. 12 through Nov. 15 in Flushing, New York.\nMonette said the duo must stress early preparation, despite there being nearly a month until the national championship.\n“It can be tricky because after a good performance, it’s tough to get back to work right away,” Monette said. “With so much time between now and then, we need to start practicing and stay focused on what’s coming.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:13:36.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
