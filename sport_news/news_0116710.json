It was 2013, Chip Kelly's first year as Philadelphia's head coach, and Foles gave the Eagles an 8-2 record as the starter while producing an NFL-best 119.2 passer rating (Weeden's was 70.3 in Cleveland). As a third-year pro in 2014, Foles still had a good record (6-2), but his rating plunged to 81.4. Kelly wrote him off. In a March 10 trade involving draft picks tilted to the Rams, Bradford went to Philadelphia and Foles arrived in St. Louis. The deal hasn't done much for either team. Bradford ranks 28th in passer rating (80.0) for the 3-3 Eagles. Foles in 29th (77.6) for the 2-3 Rams. The 6-foot-5 Foles operates a run-first offense. He has averaged 27.5 passes in his two home games. The Browns' Josh McCown has averaged 45.4 passes in his four full games. If Foles must throw, he knows the drill. He averaged 47 attempts and 360 yards in his senior year at Arizona. His most interesting NFL game might have come in 2013 against McCown's team at the time, Chicago. McCown made a surprising series of starts in place of injured Jay Cutler, Bears coach Marc Trestman had gone back to Cutler. Three days before Christmas, McCown watched from the sidelines as Foles posted a 131.7 rating and led Philadelphia to a 54-11 win. THERE GOES GURLEY The Browns' No. 32 run defense is allowing a Jim Brown-like 5.0 yards-per-carry, based on a disturbing number of breakaways. Rams rookie Todd Gurley (5.7) has had a hot hand in two flu games since returning from a knee issue. He is the only man in the league with two runs of more than 50 yards. With 159 yards at Green Bay and 146 at Arizona, Gurley has two of the NFL's top seven rushing games in 2015. Rookie Round 2 pick Nate Orchard, an outside linebacker who must set an edge for for the Browns, said penning in Gurley doesn't necessarily do the trick. \"He doesn't run east and west,\" Orchard said. \"He runs downhill, hard. He gets home and looks to make big plays.\" • The Rams aren't bothering to rest Gurley's knee. He has made 49 of the last 55 carries attempted by a Rams running back. Wide receiver Tavon Austin is the change-of-pace guy. He has made five runs for 42 yards in the last two games. BUSH, T-RICH, GURLEY Only six running backs have been drafted in the top 10 in the last 10 drafts. They are: • No. 2 overall, Reggie Bush, Saints, 2006 • No. 3 overall, Trent Richardson, Browns, 2012 • No. 4 overall, Darren McFadden, Raiders, 2008 • No. 7 overall, Adrian Peterson, Vikings, 2007 Page 2 of 2 - • No. 9 overall, C.J. Spiller, Bills, 2010 • No. 10 overall, Todd Gurley, Rams, 2015. DROUGHTS ARE US The Rams haven't had a winning season since 2004. From 2007-11, their record was a petrifying 15-65, which helps explain why there are so many empty seats now, and why the climate is right to move. The Browns' worst five-year stretches during their expansion era were 23-57 from 2009-13 and from 2008-12. The last time the Browns played in St. Louis was 2007, when they fell behind early, got back in the game after running back Steven Jackson got hurt, and won 27-20. As in 2015, the 2007 was a Game 7. The Browns improved to 4-3 and went on to a 10-6 finish. The Rams wound up 3-13. BEER AND ICE CREAM No names please, but there are media members who say they will miss St. Louis, which has the only NFL press box with a beer tap and ice cream. The good times might be drying up. St. Louis, Oakland and San Diego are on the radar for a relocation to Los Angeles. The Browns, who relocated to Baltimore in 1996 and reappeared in 1999, will have faced all three in 2015 with the playing of the Rams game. • The number of people who recall the Cleveland Rams is dwindling. Those Rams won the 1945 NFL championship, then moved to Los Angeles in 1946, the year the Cleveland Browns opened business in the All-American Football Conference. It would be hard for St. Louis to be in too much of an uproar over locating to L.A. The Rams moved from California to Missouri after the 1994 season, the 48th after moving from Cleveland EXTRA PONTS • Jeff Garcia, the only Browns quarterback to win an expansion-era season opener (2004 against Baltimore), is a first-year assistant coach with the Rams. • Former Ohio State linebacker James Laurinaitis leads the Rams in career tackles with 935, ahead of a colorful trio from the Los Angeles years, Merlin Olsen (915), Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds (897) and David \"Deacon\" Jones (896). • In the Rams' most recent game, Laurinaitis picked off Aaron Rodgers, ending the Packer QB's streak of passes without an interception at Lambeau Field at 587. • The players with the most sacks since the start of the 2012 season are J.J. Watt (Texans, 55.5), Justin Houston (Chiefs, 47), Robert Quinn (Rams, 44), Von Miller (Broncos, 40.5), Elvis Dumervil (Broncos-Ravens, 40) and Mario Williams (Texans-Bills). After the Rams game, the Browns will have faced Dumervil, Miller and Quinn back to back to back.
