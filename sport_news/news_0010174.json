Other stadiums, not so much.\nPenn State (5-2) never fully recovered from a 21-3 second-quarter deficit, notching a second-half touchdown but falling 38-10 on Saturday night at Ohio Stadium for its fourth straight loss to No. 1 Ohio State (7-0). The loss was Penn State’s first since suffering a season-opening upset to Temple in Philadelphia, and it snapped a five-game winning streak.\nJunior quarterback Christian Hackenberg entered the game needing just 195 yards to set the school’s passing yards record but fell short, completing 7 of 13 passes for 120 yards and a touchdown. He was sacked five times and completed fewer than 10 passes for just the second time in his career.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \nA stout Penn State defense lived up to its reputation during Ohio State’s first three drives, limiting the Buckeyes to 18 yards. The defense then buckled for OSU touchdown drives of 70, 45 and 66 yards in the second quarter and allowed the Buckeyes 398 yards of total offense.\nWhat went right Freshman running back Saquon Barkley, who had been out because of an apparent ankle injury since the Nittany Lions’ win over San Diego State on Sept. 26, made his return and was electric. He had 13 carries for 86 yards in the first half, accounting for all but 62 of the Lions’ total yards in the half. He also had a 44-yard touchdown run called back on a hold by right guard Brian Gaia with 3:20 left in the first quarter. As his carries mounted, Barkley continued to pound the middle of the Buckeyes defense, eclipsing 100 yards for the third time in six games. He finished with career-high 26 carries for 194 rushing yards.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nShining moment The Nittany Lions had just three plays of more than 40 yards, and two of those belonged to sophomore receiver Chris Godwin. On Penn State’s second offensive play, Godwin shook a would-be tackler for a 45-yard catch and run that led to the Lions’ lone three points of the first half. On Penn State’s first play from scrimmage in the second half, Hackenberg went Godwin’s way again. Godwin bobbled then caught the deep ball, completing a 56-yard gain to set up his team’s first touchdown of the game.\nStar power Former walk-on defensive end Carl Nassib, who entered the game with a Football Bowl Subdivision-leading 10 sacks, continued to terrorize opposing quarterbacks. He had 1 1/2 sacks in the third quarter and finished the game with eight total tackles, 3 1/2 for loss.\nTelling stat 285: The number of combined rushing yards gained against Penn State by Ezekiel Elliott, J.T. Barrett and Braxton Miller.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \nCoach speak “Those guys, the combination of the tailback (Ezekiel Elliott), the quarterback (J.T. Barrett) and Braxton Miller, like I mentioned, those three guys just played at a different speed and that definitely factored in. There’s no doubt about it.” — James Franklin\nTrivial matters Saturday’s game was Hackenberg’s fourth straight without an interception. He has thrown just two this season. … Penn State is winless in its past six games against top-ranked opponents, its last upset of a No.1 coming in 1991 over Georgia Tech.\naerickson@dispatch.com \n@AndrewRErickson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:55.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
