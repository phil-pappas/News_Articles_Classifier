Already with a record of 2-3, the Hawks simply could not afford to fall to 2-4, especially with the NFC West leading Arizona Cardinals losing earlier in the day. \nThey needed a win, and they got one from a host of players, but their inability to hang on to a lead doomed them yet again as they fell late to the Panthers 27-23. \n  with dozens of problems but none more apparent than their inability to finish a game. Here are my takeaways from the game. Lynch looked good, despite his numbers, and the loss. What I Liked \nIt was very good to see Marshawn Lynch back in action. He looked very good running the ball despite his lower than usual numbers. He had several explosive runs called back by penalties that led to those lower numbers. \nPenalties aside, Seattle seems to continue to feed off his energy and explosiveness and they need #24 to continue to be the Beast we have all come to know and love. \nJimmy Graham had a very good first half catching three balls for 41 yards. He wasn’t done either. Graham exploded for over 100 yards receiving in this one. \nThe Seahawks offensive coordinator, Darrell Bevell, finally found   to Jimmy on something over the middle consistently. It was good to see and productive for the Seahawks offense too. \nI don’t think there is any doubt that the Legion of Boom was in full force at times in this game. Earl Thomas picked off one Cam Newton pass and nearly got another had there not been great “defense” from his teammate Cary Williams who knocked the ball away from him. Thomas’s pick set up Seattle’s first points of the game, a field goal that bounced in after hitting the upright. \nThe Legion of Boom wasn’t done taking it away either. Kam Chancellor answered Thomas with a pick of his own in the 3 rd quarter. The turnover led to another field goal, a long one by Steven Hauschka , 50 yards that put Seattle up by two scores. \nAlso on display in this one was the 12 th man. The crowd was tremendously loud in this matchup. It energized the defense when they needed it and they clearly created a handful of false starts by the Carolina offense. \nWhat I Didn’t Like Can any LOB member cover a tight end? (AP Photo/John Froschauer) \nFootball is a physical game. It is an emotional game and guys have to play with both on a regular basis. The trick is they also have to temper that physicality and emotion with poise. One guy that did not today is Ricardo Lockette . \nLockette has had a problem getting baited into unnecessary roughness calls this year and it happened again against Carolina. He costs the Seahawks precious field position twice. It is something that has to stop. \n  struggling covering their opponent’s tight ends. Greg Olson had a big day against the Seattle defense. In the past, Chancellor and KJ Wright have always done an excellent job in this regard but this year has been a different story. Kevin Pierre-Louis filled in for Wright in this one and did not fare any better. \nDespite the struggles of those players, it was Seattle’s best two defenders, Richard Sherman and Thomas who blew the coverage of Olson for the game winning touchdown. What I Really Didn’t Like \nAs good as the Seahawks defense was in this game, they gave up way, way, way too many rushing yards in this game. Both Stewart and Tolbert were consistently moving the pile for big gains on the ground. Newton also carried the ball himself for big gains. \nHow much of the Carolina ground attack can be laid on the absence of Bobby Wagner is debatable I suppose, but tend to think Wagner would not have made as big of a difference as people tend to think in this regard. Looking Ahead \nThe Seahawks get an easier road trip for the first time all year next week. They head to Santa Clara to face the 49ers who have more problems than congress. \nStill, that 49ers game can be a wild one regardless of the records of the two teams so I look for another close one.
