(AP) - Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles plans to practice in full Wednesday, three days after spraining his throwing shoulder in a loss at Tampa Bay. \nBortles says his shoulder \"feels good\" and he doesn't expect \"any limitations.\" \nCoach Gus Bradley said Monday he wouldn't be surprised if Bortles missed practice Wednesday while recovering. Bortles responded Wednesday by saying, \"I think he was just taking the safe route. I planned on practicing the whole time and I think that's kind of the attitude you have to have. I'm going to practice until they tell me I can't.\" \nBortles has completed 57 percent of his passes this season for 1,299 yards, with 10 touchdowns, four interceptions and 14 sacks. \nHe's coming off the first four-touchdown performance of his career. \nJacksonville hosts Houston on Sunday. \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
