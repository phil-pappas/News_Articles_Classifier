Thomas/Getty Images Doctors checking out Daniel Fells’ ankle injury discovered a staph infection. The Giants have just lost their finest all-around tight end.\nOn Monday morning, one day after a dominant victory over the Bills that had the Giants celebrating, the club announced that veteran tight end Daniel Fells was headed to injured reserve.\nVACCHIANO: SUDDENLY, JASON PIERRE-PAUL IS FORGOTTEN MAN\nFells, who had been dealing with an ankle injury, was treated for the issue over the weekend. During that treatment, the club discovered he had a staph infection, which will require further treatment. He was immediately placed on I.R.\nThe blow is another tough one for an offense that's already weathering the absences of Victor Cruz ( knee/calf ) and offensive lineman Will Beatty (torn pectoral). Fells was the Giants' best blocking tight end, a necessity for a team that is still working hard to establish its rushing attack.\nWithout Fells, the Giants must rely on Larry Donnell, who has struggled as a blocker this season. Rookie Will Tye, on the practice squad until Friday, was called up on Saturday and is the team's other current option. Both tight ends saw time in Sunday's 24-10 win over the Bills. The club's other tight end, Jerome Cunningham, has been nursing a knee injury since Week 2, and lacks experience.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nThe Giants may look to add a veteran tight end in the coming days, especially since their offense is thin overall. Offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo likes to run three-wide formations, but the Giants currently have just four receivers on the roster. So when Cruz stand-in Dwayne Harris was briefly injured Sunday, running back Shane Vereen and tight ends Donnell and Tye both saw reps split out wide.\nHarris returned later and said he was fine after the game.\nRelated Stories Giants beat Bills to even record, Eli Manning throws 3 TDs Myers: Jets, Giants both relevant at quarter mark Giants Insider: Rueben Randle breaks out Cruz's salsa dance Tags: daniel fells", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:11:45.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
