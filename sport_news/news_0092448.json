This week’s question is a bit blunter, and it pertains to both old and new coaches alike: Who is on the hot seat, and whose seat is starting to warm up?\nLet’s run down the NBA’s 30 coaches from “not going anywhere” to “saving up for bus fare.” Totally, totally safe\nThe cream of the crop.\nGregg Popovich, Spurs : The league’s best coach reportedly assured LaMarcus Aldridge this summer that he planned to stay on the job until at least 2019. Popovich’s track record of success speaks for itself, but that report neatly sums up the implications of his historic tenure. How many coaches are so well respected that A-list free agents would seek such assurances? How many coaches, in a league where seven to 10 guys get fired every year, are in position to make promises four years down the road?\nSteve Kerr, Warriors : Golden State’s golden boy just won 67 games and a title in his first season. The only way Kerr isn’t back with the Warriors next year is if U.S. voters hire him to replace Barack Obama.\nBrad Stevens, Celtics : More valuable to the Celtics than any single player on the roster? Stevens won 15 more games in 2014–15 than he did in 2013–14, even though his two biggest names ( Rajon Rondo and Jeff Green ) were shipped out in midseason trades and his highest-paid player ( Gerald Wallace ) couldn’t crack the playoff rotation. Stevens, 39, is right there with Kerr when it comes to answering the “Coach you would most like to build your franchise around” question.\n• MORE NBA: SI staff predicts NBA Finals winner for 2015–​16 Totally safe (because they don’t answer to management)\nOne sure path to job security is a dual coach/executive role.\nStan Van Gundy, Pistons : Van Gundy flexed his considerable muscles by waiving Josh Smith last season, thereby convincing his owner to eat more than $25 million in guaranteed salary. Given that Van Gundy is his own boss and he’s entering just the second year of his own five-year, $35 million deal, he’s very well-insulated from any frustrations should the Pistons sputter through another ugly season. While he might wind up regretting the size of the contracts he gave to Reggie Jackson and Aron Baynes , Van Gundy is a coaching lifer with a comfortable setup: his team has considerable room for progress and his contract affords him plenty of time to make it.\nDoc Rivers, Clippers : When Rivers makes noise about 2015–16 being a make-or-break year for the Clippers’ core, he sounds more like a president speaking honestly about his franchise’s long-term future rather than a coach looking to push buttons—even though he’s both simultaneously. Rivers’s own future is secure: he answers to himself and he’s entering year two of a five-year, $50 million contract. If the mess hits the fan again come playoff time, Rivers is positioned to publicly take the blame while privately orchestrating whatever personnel changes he deems necessary.\nMike Budenholzer, Hawks : Budenholzer is sitting pretty after a blistering 60-win season, a trip to the East finals and the 2015 Coach of the Year award. Not only did he survive an ownership transfer this summer, but he came out on top: Budenholzer was officially named team president after the Hawks reached a buyout with Danny Ferry. All things considered, Atlanta is a pretty good fiefdom: Budenholzer doesn’t face serious championship expectations, he returns most of his roster this season, and his Spurs-esque style of play has proven consistently effective in the weaker East. Even if the Hawks regress in 2014–15, it’s hard to see how any fingers would be pointed back at Budenholzer after he delivered extraordinary value on his team’s reasonable 2014–15 payroll.\nSafe (because they just got here) Photo: Brock Williams-Smith/Getty Images ​\nThese first-time coaches will have room to work.\nFred Hoiberg, Bulls : Chicago’s polarizing management team stuck its neck out by dumping Tom Thibodeau to hire Hoiberg, their hand-selected candidate. “The Mayor” arrives on a five-year deal worth a reported $25 million. Simply put, it would be too embarrassing and too costly for the Bulls to immediately dump Hoiberg, even if the Bulls suffered through a “worst-case scenario” type of disaster.\nBilly Donovan, Thunder : As with Hoiberg, Donovan’s arrival in Oklahoma City came a steep price: $30 million over five years, plus the various risks associated with firing Scott Brooks. Thunder GM Sam Presti seemed to target Donovan because he has the cachet to reach superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook and a strong enough personality to help carry the franchise forward if Durant leaves next summer in free agency.\nNBA Examining Thabo Sefolosha’s lawsuit vs. NYC, NYPD: Five biggest questions by Michael McCann", "external_links": ["http://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/Coveted-free-agent-Aldridge-chooses-Spurs-6366364.php?t=1c3f33c29c927fc3fb&cmpid=twitter-premium&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_term=NBA%20National%20Newsletter&utm_campaign=GMIB%207%2F5%2F2015", "http://t.co/SNzNxUeyvy", "http://twitter.com/bengolliver"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:22:50.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
