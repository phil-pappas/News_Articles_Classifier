That loss came at the hands of Wisconsin in the Final Four, and Badger fans were sure to remind the No. 1 overall pick of that last night . \nThe Minnesota Timberwolves faced off with the Milwaukee Bucks in a preseason game at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wis., on Tuesday night, home of the Wisconsin Badgers. The home crowd chanted \"38-1\" at Towns, a reminder of his record while a Wildcat. Fans here yelling \"38-1\" at Karl-Anthony Towns. Well, that's not very nice. — Kyle Ratke (@Kyle_Ratke) October 21, 2015 \nTowns finished with six points and six rebounds in a 106-88 loss, but has looked solid for the Timberwolves in the preseason. He's also on the cover of Sports Illustrated this week. I already texted @KarlTowns and told him it doesn't make our @SInow wall. #WrongUni pic.twitter.com/eRSvtaIVfq — John Calipari (@UKCoachCalipari) October 20, 2015 \nJeremy Schneider may be reached at jschneider@njadvancemedia.com .
