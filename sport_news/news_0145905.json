Dutchtown enters the Tigers den at 2-4, having tamed R.L. Osborne 35-19 before losing a 21-7 decision to Camden County followed by a 20-12 win over Lovejoy.The Bulldogs then went on a two-game skid, dropping a 31-29 decision to Starr’s Mill followed by a 10-7 setback to Woodland.Although Stockbridge head football coach Kevin Whitley said his team is excited about its four-game win streak and piling up the points on opponents as it has, his club has been bitten, at least partially, by the injury bug.“Our main concern now is not only in keeping our guys healthy but having them remain focused on the big picture, meaning our slate of upcoming subregion opponents,” he said, which include Luella, Ola, Woodland and Union Grove.“As we get into subregion play, everyone has to be healthy if we want to continue to do what we like to do, offensively and defensively,” Whitley said.He is not as concerned about his team’s total offense or what his defense is allowing opponents in any game, just so long as it results in a win.“I know we are scoring an average of about 36 points per game and allowing something like 11,” Whitley said.“As long as we get the that ‘W’ in the important won-loss record column and my boys come out of the game pretty healthy with no one getting hurt bad, I’m fine.”Entering the Stockbridge game, Dutchtown was averaging about 300 yards in total offense per game but Myers didn’t have current figures on what his defense is allowing, only saying they are giving up an average of about 17 points per game.His main concern involves keeping possession of the football, meaning fumbles and some pass interceptions.“Keeping possession of the football has been our major nemesis,” Myers said.“In the past two games, we have turned the ball over eight times, primary through fumbles with some pass interceptions.”Myers said his club is always working on that aspect of the game in practice.“We are paying close attention to avoiding turnovers as it is something we continue to work on,” he said.Pacing Dutchtown’s offense is senior quarterback K’lin Epps who has more than 450 yards rushing this season and has scored four touchdowns as he paces the team’s ground attack.As well as Epps is doing as a rusher, his major offensive threat is in passing where Myers said he has gained more than 900 yards this season through his aerial attack and has scored 12 touchdowns.His favorite receiver is senior wide out David Dennis, who is leading the team is total reception yardage with 450.If Dennis is covered too well, Epps looks for his second favorite passing target, senior wide receiver D.J. Montgomery.“These guys are our 1-2 punch in pass receptions as D.J. has more than 450 yards in total receptions this season and has scored five touchdowns,” Myers said.Stockbridge’s leading rusher is junior running back Jalen Holston who has more than 300 yards rushing thus far this season and has scored three touchdowns, Whitley said.Tiger senior quarterback Malachi Brown is not far behind Holston, as he has also eclipsed the 300 yards rushing threshold and has five touchdowns on the ground. Whitley said his defense has been led thus far this season by middle linebacker David Brown who is averaging more than eight stops per game.Despite Stockbridge’s unbeaten string and the Dutchtown game being a home contest for the Tigers, Whitley isn’t taking the Bulldogs lightly.Myers worked with Whitley when the latter became the Tiger head football coach.“We can’t afford to give Dutchtown scoring opportunities by turnovers as they are took good a team,” he said.
