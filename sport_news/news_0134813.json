It’s not an item that people are going, ‘Oh, let’s go see the soccer game.’ It’s part of the fabric. It’s part of the culture. It’s part of the community. … We’re entrenched in this community. That’s what that reflects.”\nPostseason streak continues \nMost Read Stories Will Pullman and the WSU Cougars get ESPN's College GameDay?

With Sunday’s win, the Sounders qualified for the postseason for the seventh consecutive season dating all the way back to the club’s inaugural season back in 2009.\n“Getting into the playoffs seven straight years shows a consistency of the club,” Schmid said, “and I think that is really a tribute to the ownership because I think there has been a consistent approach all the way through. There hasn’t been any panic. For my sake, we haven’t gone through eight coaches in seven years, which is a good thing for me.\n“I think when you’re consistent, have an approach and stay true to the course, you can achieve things like that. For us to be there, especially as an expansion team, is absolutely phenomenal. I don’t think in any sport an expansion team has made the playoffs seven years in a row in our country.”\nAlonso limps off \nSounders midfielder Osvaldo Alonso, who fatefully missed the first leg of the Western Conference finals series they lost to L.A. last season, limped off the field in the 73th minute of Sunday’s game. And though he has just a handful of recovery days before the Sounders host the Galaxy in a one-game playoff Wednesday at CenturyLink, Schmid sounded optimistic about Alonso’s availability.\n“Came out a little bit as a precaution,” Schmid said. “He felt a little bit of something so we wanted to make sure he didn’t go beyond that. … We think he’ll be alright for Wednesday.”\nGonzalez starts at left back \nIn a reflection both of the shallow depth at the position and the indomitable spirit of a longtime standby, 34-year-old defender Leo Gonzalez started a must-win game for the Sounders on Sunday at left back.\nAnd though rookie Oniel Fisher was recovered enough from his recent hamstring injury to make the bench and Dylan Remick is also healthy, it sounds as though Gonzalez again tops the depth chart as Seattle enters the postseason.\n“We think that right now, he’s our best option at left back,” Schmid said.\nMatt Pentz : 206-464-3184 or mpentz@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @mattpentz .
