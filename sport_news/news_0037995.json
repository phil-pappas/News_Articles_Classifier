Hunt accepts one-week ban \nBrisbane halfback Ben Hunt will have to wait one more week to avenge his nightmarish NRL grand final performance. \nThe Broncos No.7 accepted a one-week suspension for a dangerous throw on Cowboys centre Kane Linnett, opting not to fight the charge. \nAlthough the base penalty for a grade-two booking attracts 325 points, Hunt’s clean slate at the judiciary and early guilty plea means he will only miss the Broncos’ first-round clash in 2016. \nThe dangerous throw on Linnett began a horror few minutes for the 25-year old. After the resulting penalty piggybacked the Cowboys downfield, Hunt had a ball stripped from his grasp in the lead-up to North Queensland’s match-levelling try. \nHe then fumbled the Cowboys’ kick-off in golden point, presenting Johnathan Thurston the field position he needed to slot home the winning field goal. \nBroncos teammate Adam Blair also took the early guilty plea on his careless high tackle charge, meaning he will escape suspension.
