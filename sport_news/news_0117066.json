Baker Stadium. The Tigers scored on every possession in the third and fourth quarters and frustrated the Pirates with their defense all night long while improving to 6-1 on the season and 4-1 in the Central Ozark Conference. It was something of a different story in the first half, however. Branson opened the game with an impressive 50-yard drive deep into Carthage territory and the Pirates gained chunks of yards before coming up short on a fourth-down try. Carthage got the ball at its own 25 and scored just nine plays later, when quarterback Keith Guest rushed in from the 14-yard line and kicker Eli Monzon made it a 7-0 game. After that, the Tigers stalled. They went three-and-out on their next two possessions, though, and then drove to the Branson 12 before losing yards on consecutive plays and losing seven yards on a fourth down. Finally, after getting the ball near midfield after a punt, the Tigers found pay dirt. Kendall Young scampered 39 yards for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the half and Carthage took a 14-0 lead into the break. \"I'm not surprised the way they came out and played because we saw them on film and they've done that to everybody,\" Carthage head coach Jon Guidie said of the visiting Pirates. \"They come out and play very well. We probably weren't as focused as we needed to be and didn't come off the ball very hard on offense and it showed. We regrouped a little bit at halftime, came out and established the line of scrimmage.\" The difference was evident in a hurry. Carthage rushed for four yards on the first play of the third quarter, and then 10 more, and then 24, 13 and 8 before Trey Collins scored from the 5 to make it 21-0. The defense followed with several more stops for a loss. Branson drove to the Carthage 29 before Collins sacked quarterback Zac Funderburk for an 18-yard loss on first down. A delay of game penalty backed Branson up to its own 48 before an incompletion, and on third down Funderburk fumbled and Carthage's Jess Hettinger wrestled control of the ball away at midfield. That led to a six-play, 52-yard drive capped by a 4-yard Young touchdown with 3:33 left in the third. Carthage led 28-0. After a Branson punt, the Tigers easily covered 79 yards for another score. Carthage gained 11 yards on the ground on first down, then 6, 23, 1, 10, 7 and 10 before Collins scored on a 1-yard run, making it 35-0 and instituting a running clock with 11:48 left in the game. Sophomore quarterback Colby Davis later added a 3-yard touchdown with 3:49 remaining to put Carthage up 41-0 before the Pirates scored on a late 21-yard touchdown pass. Page 2 of 2 - Branson was limited to 214 yards of offense on 55 plays and just 78 on the ground. Collins finished with three sacks, Andrew Moore had a sack-and-a-half and Zach Thornton had half a sack. \"It was a great effort from those guys,\" Guidie said of the defense. \"Branson does some real nice things offensively and it takes some patience sometimes to defend an offense like that. They hit us a couple times on some shovel passes. I thought our defensive backs covered very well tonight and I thought our front five put a lot of pressure on the quarterback and forced them into some negative yardage situations.\" Carthage lowered its average points allowed to 15.6 on the season. As for the offense, it was another huge rushing night. Carthage rushed for 396 yards to eclipse the 2,000-yard mark for the year. Guidie said the difference with the offense's effectiveness in the second half came down largely to better blocking from the line. \"In large part,\" he said. \"We didn't really make too many adjustments at halftime. We adjusted our mindset, was the main thing. Those guys came out and decided they were going to get together and do what we do. Credit to them in the second half.\" Young led the team with 118 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries. Collins scored twice on nine carries while rushing for 86 and Guest added 85 yards and a score on 13 carries. Dausen Gourley rushed five times for 55 yards and Clay Newman added four for 32. Guest was 5-for-7 passing for 58 yards. Gourley caught two passes for 26 yards and Tyler Ralston and Logan Kabance each had a 13-yard reception. Carthage now has just two regular season games remaining, and next week's contest against Nixa will be the home finale before district play. The Eagles are 4-3 and have seen a drop off in recent weeks. Last week it was a 35-28 loss to Neosho, and on Friday Nixa won 19-7 against an Ozark team with six losses that allows an average of 32 points per game and gave up 66 to Carthage.
