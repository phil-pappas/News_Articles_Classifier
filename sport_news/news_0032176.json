This is going to be his team and his ball, that's as apparent as the gains in his game from another obsessive off-season.\nValentine plays the point almost exclusively against Italy. He races the ball up the court on a fast break and kicks out to his childhood pal and fellow Lansing Sexton state champion, Bryn Forbes, for a three-pointer.\nHe gets a rebound and goes again, this time entering the lane, faking left, getting a defender in the air and spinning the other way for one of his gym-rat hook shots. He pops off a screen for a long-range swish, then another. He underhands a lob pass, dunked down by freshman Deyonta Davis, as the Spartans get within five points with 5 minutes left.\nAnd at some point in a huddle, Valentine demands to guard Italian star and ninth-year NBA guard Marco Belinelli.\n\"As I'm getting closer to playing professionally, I just wanted to see where I'm at as far as guarding pros,\" Valentine said a month later. \"That's one of the things people say or scouts say: 'Is he gonna be able to guard an NBA guard? Is he gonna be able to guard a point guard? Can he guard this person or that person?' So I just wanted to guard him and see where I was at, wanted to take that challenge.\"\nNormally, Izzo would have refused, considering fatigue and all the other demands he was putting on Valentine. But when near Rome …\n\"He really wanted to do it,\" Izzo said. \"So I said, '(Screw) it. It's an exhibition game. Go for it.' Zel was unbelievable.\"\nSo was Belinelli, hitting a few shots with Valentine in his face and scoring a game-high 25 as Italy pulled away late. Valentine scored 23 and did it all for the Spartans.\nAnd that's one thing that can be taken from the four games in Italy (MSU went 1-3, beating a club team and losing to Russia and Georgia as well) and applied to the 2015-16 season again and again. Valentine was one of three catalysts for the plucky 2014-15 Spartans, leading an improbable sprint from the NCAA bubble to the Final Four.\nLeading scorer Travis Trice and lithe athlete Branden Dawson are gone, leaving Valentine to try to navigate Izzo to his eighth Final Four in his 21st season. The sizable improvements Valentine made from his freshman to sophomore season, then sophomore to junior season, suggest he'll have a chance.\nHe'll have a chance at the NBA, too, which was not in the forecast when Valentine joined the Spartans in 2012 as a local hero with middling recruiting evaluations.\n\"My athleticism is always gonna be the 'con' of my game, but I just have to improve that with lifting, agility drills, conditioning,\" said the 6-foot-5 Valentine, who scored 14.5 points a game last season. \"You know, I'm not gonna sprawl into some Branden Dawson or something like that, but I can improve.\n\"I might not have the best numbers or best vertical, best lateral ability, whatever you want to say. But at the end of the day, I'm gonna go out and compete, give it my all and try to beat my opponent. It's worked so far.\"\nAnd his game has advanced each year. Valentine's vision always has been supreme, but he was not a scorer in high school.\nHe was a role player on loaded MSU teams as a freshman and a sophomore, then had to do much more last season — and responded by upping his scoring by 6.5 points a game, more than doubling his three-pointers to 102 and improving his three-point accuracy from 37.7% to 41.6%. His rebounds and assists increased, too.\nValentine's summer workouts are legendary for their creativity and difficulty, some of them involving an Elevation Training Mask to simulate high altitude and enhance conditioning. After changing his shot before his junior season, Valentine stressed ballhandling this summer, which also included a bronze medal with the Pan American Games team.\nThat's because he'll split the point with sophomore Tum Tum Nairn for a team that should have more talent and scoring options than last season's. It will be his first time playing the position extensively, and it brings up the part of his game everyone — NBA teams included — want to see shrink.\nIzzo arranges preseason meetings with seniors, their parents and agents so both sides can be as informed as possible, and one of the agents who met with the Valentines brought up Denzel's career-high 92 turnovers last season.\nThat actually represented improvement considering how much more he had the ball last season, but glaring errors such as a late giveaway in last season's Big Ten tournament title game loss to Wisconsin stick in the memory of some.\n\"He's done four really good years of growing, but that one thing makes some people question him,\" Izzo said. \"It's like your reputation — 20 years of good and one bad, and the one bad changes the reputation. I think that's where he has to make the biggest improvement. Can he run a team? Can he handle the ball? He still has to score and rebound, too.\"\nAnd defend, and that aspect of Valentine's skill set might have improved the most in his time at MSU. Asked to name the best part of his game, Valentine responded: \"Winning.\"\nHe expects to do a lot of it with a team that brings in a promising freshman class and a dynamic scorer in West Virginia guard Eron Harris.\n\"I think we're pretty much a complete team,\" Valentine said. \"We can play fast, we can play slow. We can go big, we can go small. We guard. We've got shooters, people who can handle the ball, and we've got passers.\"\nAnd one guy who can, and must, do it all.\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com.
