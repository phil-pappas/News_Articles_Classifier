Coach Mark Whipple said as much himself following the Minutemen's 62-27 loss in South Bend Saturday. \nBut are those backups – many of them 3- and 4-star recruits biding their time until a starting spot opens up – better than some of the teams UMass will soon see during MAC play? Are they better than Kent State or Eastern Michigan or Miami (Ohio)? \nCould Notre Dame's second string beat UMass? \nMaybe it's a silly question, but for Ross Comis, who Saturday was charged with handling mop-up duty against the Fighting Irish's second-team, the idea is a little more meaningful. \nAfter making his collegiate debut two weeks earlier with an up-and-down, 4-for-8 performance against Colorado, the redshirt freshman went a perfect 8 of 8 for 69 yards and a touchdown on a much bigger stage against much better players. \nComis didn't look scared, which is about as much as a coach might have hoped for. In fact, he looked downright comfortable at times. His timing and tempo were strong and his touchdown, a corner throw to Shakur Nesmith with 3:35 left to play, showed nice touch. \nUltimately, two drives at the back end of a 35-point loss won't be much more than a footnote in the grand scale of the 2015 season. But for Comis, it was an important next step in his development as Minutemen's potential starter in the post-Blake Frohnapfel era. \n\"It was a great experience. It was great to get in there. \"I got my feet wet a little bit at Colorado and that helped me out definitely,\" Comis said, adding that the crowd size or mythic grandeur of South Bend didn't even enter his mind when he got under center. \n\"When it comes down to it, it's just a game,\" he said. \"I wasn't looking up at the crowd or anything. I just played my game, stayed within myself and made some plays for us. \n\"I felt relaxed. I didn't feel it was as big a stage as it was with national TV and everything. I went out and felt relaxed, felt in place. I was ready to go.\" \nIf Whipple had his druthers, Comis wouldn't have had see the field for as long as he did Saturday. In UMass blowout wins, sure, but not like that. But the extra tape on Comis is a useful teaching tool and the UMass coach liked what he saw. \n\"He completed all his passes, so that's good,\" Whipple said. \"I think the work at Colorado helped him and the reps he's gotten here. He's been getting good.\" \nRight before the season, Comis described his level of play as being higher than ever before. In a few short weeks, he feels he's come even further in his development. \n\"I always knew that I could make plays. When my number's called, I can go out there and help my team win,\" he said. \"But I think this week really proved something to me. When my number's called or something happens to Blake, my teammates trust me now. They know I can go out and help the team get a win. \n\"Especially with game experience, I think that I'm going to keep getting better. I'm a redshirt freshman, so I'm going to keep getting better as it goes on.\" \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:41:57.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
