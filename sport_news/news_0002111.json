I knew it was kind of coming, at some point,'' Taormina. \"I saw him skating pretty fast and it's Angelidis, so you don't really see that too much.'' \nOuch. Shots fired at the captain. \n\"He's going to kill me. Nah, just joking,'' Taormina said. \"He was coming at me pretty quick and I just couldn't get (free).'' \nBut such natural revelry aside, Taormina did indeed take a forced hiatus from the Crunch, one that lasted more than a season. \nAnd if he hadn't gone away, he might not be back with the team now. \nThe Lightning re-signed Taormina at the very opening bell of free agency last summer after deciding he had learned from a painful wakeup call. His game had slipped to the point where Tampa Bay had shipped him from the Crunch to Springfield at the end of the 2013-14 season, his second with Syracuse, and subsequently he almost didn't get a contract anywhere in the AHL last season. \nBut while Tampa Bay sent the talented playmaker away, it certainly didn't forget about him. The Lightning tracked him through his all-star season with Worcester last year, and eventually figured he'd be a valuable asset again. \nTaormina looked fast, strong and, most importantly, confident. \n\"Last year he put all of those attributes to good use and worked his way back to an NHL contract,'' said Tampa Bay assistant general manager Julien BriseBois. \"We brought him in because we know we can use him at the NHL level. We feel really privileged to have him in our group. We were never taking any risks in signing him. We knew what to expect from him. As soon as we saw the bounceback in his level of play, we knew he was a good player.'' \nTaormina, who has played in 56 NHL games with New Jersey and Tampa Bay, can't quite pinpoint when his first tenure with the Crunch began to sour. \nHe contributed four goals and 20 assists in 55 games for Syracuse in 2012-13, helping the team to the Calder Cup finals. The next year, Toarmina was both injured and weighed down by a general malaise, although his numbers were still a decent 6-12 in 41 contests. \n\"He wasn't playing on as high a level as he was accustomed to on a regular basis,'' BriseBois said. \n\"The team was struggling. I was struggling. My game wasn't there. My confidence was down,'' Taormina said. \"Maybe I just got a little comfortable.'' \nThat feeling didn't last long. \nTaormina closed that season with three goals and five helpers in 17 games for Springfield. He figured he'd find a good deal in the subsequent free agent shopping. \nHe figured wrong. Toarmina didn't get a solid whiff from any team in North America until Worcester came through with an offer just days before the AHL season began. \n\"That was a long and somewhat stressful off-season,'' Toarmina understated. \nToarmina didn't let it weigh him down. Worcester had a young team, virtually ensuring him plenty of minutes. He responded with a 11 goals, 27 assists and a trip to Utica for the AHL all-star game. The 38 points were his most since he produced 50 for Lowell in 2009-10. \n\"I think I had something to prove last year. And the situation going over to Worcester definitely helped. My confidence was very high,'' Taormina said. \"I think it was just maybe a new team, just a new perspective. I think everything kind of fell into place. Scrambling for that amount of time (last summer), the stress, it really turned out to be the best thing for me. We had a really young team last year, so they gave me a lot of trust and confidence early and I think I just kind of rolled with that.'' \nThat momentum bulldozed its way into the off-season. The 5-foot-10, 185-pound Taormina pounded the weights, turning into someone BriseBois said tested out as pound-for-pound one of the strongest players in the organization. \n\"It allows him to play a very effective game in a league where there aren't that many defensemen his size,'' BriseBois said. \n\"I didn't really work out too much last year, during the season,'' Taormina said. \"I think the muscle memory came back pretty quick. The big thing for me is I want to keep my speed. Guys are getting faster. I'm getting older. I need to be able to push some guys around. The game has changed a little bit. So it's not necessarily a strength thing. But I just tried to do whatever I could do during the summer.'' \nToarmina said his agent told him he had interest from about five or six NHL teams as free agency approached. But the one that nabbed him with a quick, early call was the one Taormina never saw coming: Tampa Bay. The Lightning viewed Taormina as a proven fix for some of the woes that made the Crunch's power play one of the worst in the AHL last season. \n\"I was really surprised because they weren't one of the teams that he (his agent) was talking about. They just kind of came out of the blue right away and they made an offer,'' Taormina said. \"It was kind of a no-brainer (to sign), coming back, especially at my age and everything, coming back to an organization that knows me. It was going to be a lot easier transition coming back.'' \nSo far, it fits like a hockey glove. \nTaormina wore No. 6 during his first stretch with Syracuse, a number sported by second-year defenseman Dylan Blujus now. Taormina could have big-footed Blujus and gotten the number back, but you don't do those types of things when you want to be a team leader. \nSo Toarmina grabbed No. 20, which was always special to him because it was the one he wore when he broke in with Lowell in 2009-10. \nThe change fits right in with the bigger point of Taormina's return to the organization. It's the same one Toarmina left two seasons ago, but he's back with a significantly different look. \n\"I want to continue (the success of) last year a little bit, be more of a leader here. Show some of the young guys the ropes, how it is as a pro, some things to expect,'' Taormina said. \"It should be fun. It should be interesting.'' \nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:17:11.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
