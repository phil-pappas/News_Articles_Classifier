The right lies only with the people, he said. Addressing a public meeting here, Khattar said the Opposition was insulting the people of Haryana by giving marks to his government. “My government took over the reins of power in the state on October 26 last year. My first year in power ends exactly today. In a democracy, the opposition parties have the right as well as the duty to ask the government questions so that the government could be kept under check. As the head of the government, it is my duty to answer all those questions,” Khattar said. “However, the opposition parties do not have any right to evaluate the government’s answersheet because this right vests only with the people who voted my government to power one year back,” he added. Khattar said soon after taking over as the CM, “I made it my top priority to set the systems right as my predecessors had been following a system of pick and choose.” The CM said the first task he did was to end skewed development in the state, which was the hallmark of the previous government. He said his government had ordered four-laning of four highways without taking into account whether these fell in BJP MLAs’ constituencies or of the opposition parties. He alleged before his government came to power, government jobs were either being given for money or to the chosen few. “We are here for five years but the employees we appoint will remain in job for almost 33 years. How will those who came into jobs without merit by paying money or nepotism will serve the people?” he asked. He said his government had set up a system by which government employees would be selected on the basis on merit. “You will see a son or a daughter of a peon or a small-time shopkeeper becoming SDM or a DSP in Haryana,” he said. He said the government would soon make 45,000 appointments, including 12,000 teachers and an equal number of constables and 4 lakh youth would be provided employment through skill development. Hitting out at the CLU industry running during the previous regime, Khattar said no CLU would be required now for setting up industry in 32 industrially backward blocks. Khattar’s schedule was delayed because the local Air Force Station did not allow his plane to land here because of poor visibility. Later, his cavalcade of vehicles was sent to Hisar where the CM’s plane landed. Khattar launched a database software project ‘Sirsa ki Betiyan’, inaugurated canal-based waterworks at Sawant Khera, Choburja and Rohan, water treatment plant at Kalanwali, a PHC at Dhotar village and laid the foundation stones of a sewage treatment plant at Rania.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:08:21.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
