Rose entered the practice coming off his first summer not rehabilitating an injury in four years.\nHe exited it facing another mental challenge.\n\"He's good,\" said Joakim Noah, who texted with Rose. \"I know he's really hungry to help lead this team.\"\nHoiberg said Kirk Hinrich, Aaron Brooks and E'Twaun Moore all will get reps while Rose sits and that Jimmy Butler can facilitate some offense as well. Rose will observe training camp practices as Hoiberg and his coaching staff implement new offensive and defensive systems.\n\"He'll still be learning,\" Hoiberg said. \"He's in great shape. So we'll go as expected as far as putting our stuff in.\"\nRecovery time for injuries similar to Derrick Rose's can take 3-4 weeks Chris Kuc The Chicago Bulls don’t yet have a definitive timeline for Derrick Rose’s return following surgery to repair a left orbital fracture, but injuries of this sort generally sideline a player for about a month.\n“The vast majority (of orbital fractures) don’t need surgery but in this case it sounds...\nThe Chicago Bulls don’t yet have a definitive timeline for Derrick Rose’s return following surgery to repair a left orbital fracture, but injuries of this sort generally sideline a player for about a month.\n“The vast majority (of orbital fractures) don’t need surgery but in this case it sounds...\n(Chris Kuc) It's likely, but not certain, Rose will wear a mask upon his return. Hoiberg played with Reggie Miller when the Hall of Famer suffered a similar injury. While wishing Rose a speedy recovery via social media, Miller playfully suggested opting, as he did, for \"cool shades\" instead of the mask.\n\"He was very sensitive to light in the beginning of the recovery,\" Hoiberg recalled of Miller.\nNevertheless, medical experts say a smooth recovery is typical.\n\"The side might be a little bit more swollen but aside from that I wouldn't really anticipate too many other issues with performance,\" said David Yoo, associate professor of ophthalmology at Loyola University Medical Center. \"Generally, after this surgery once you're done with all the antibiotics your vision should be back to the way it was within a week.\"\nThe Bulls begin their exhibition schedule Tuesday at home against the Bucks. They have grown so accustomed to life without Rose that players are almost numb to the line of questioning. About all that was missing Wednesday was a \"next man up\" mantra.\n\"It's unfortunate that he won't be a part of most of training camp and preseason because it's a useful time for any team to get things on track, set the foundation for the season, especially with a new system, new philosophy, new coach,\" Pau Gasol said. \"But no excuses. Life works out that way sometimes and you just have to keep working.\"\nIf Rose returns in two weeks, that would give him five days to prepare for the third-to-last exhibition. Given that game starts a back-to-back scenario, playing in two exhibitions is more likely.\nUntil then, training camp doesn't stop.\n\"We still have a job to do. We can't hang our heads or feel sorry for ourselves,\" Hoiberg said. \"It's about getting these guys prepared to play. Injuries are a part of this game, and guys have stepped in during the past for this team and given great minutes when key guys have been sidelined. So that's our main focus right now.\"\nChicago Tribune's Chris Kuc contributed.\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Derrick Rose Fred Hoiberg Chicago Bulls Taj Gibson", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c28a3/turbine/ct-rose-bulls-recovery-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c247b/turbine/ct-derrick-rose-orbital-surgery-20150930"], "published": "2015-10-01T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:58:56.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
