Paul Conrad For The Bellingham Herald i Order Reprint of this Story \nChristian Rodriguez is a senior defensive end on Ferndale High School’s football team. Football is his passion, his focus, his life plan. \nWhen not on the field, Rodriguez is playing basketball with his friends or spending time with his family. He is making plans to pursue a coaching career after high school. \nQuestion: What do you want to do after high school? \nAnswer: I really want to attend WSU or Central and hopefully major in sports communication so that hopefully one day I can become a coach. \nQ: What got you hooked on football? \nA: The bond with teammates, especially that good feeling you all share after a win. Always being able to look back on it and feel good about it. \nQ: What are other activities you are passionate about? \nA: I used to have some. That’s the thing, I’m so into football I don’t have time for other stuff. I guess you could say archery, I used to be into that. ... My neighbor used to be really into it and he invited me over and I started shooting, then I would do local tournaments when I was younger. I got second and first a few times so I was really into it, but when I got more into football and started playing more, I just left it aside. If I could, I would find a way to balance the two because I still really like it. \nQ: What are some goals you have for senior year? \nA: Preferably for school, I would like to be on honor roll. For football I would like to win the league championship, it has been a long time. \nQ: How would you balance achieving those two goals? \nA: You just have to stay concentrated in both and realize that if you don’t have an education, you won’t really go anywhere with football past high school. You have to want it. \nQ: What is your favorite class in school? \nA: Does weight training count? Besides that, probably science because it’s kind of interesting how all that stuff works. \nQ: What legacy do you want to leave with your high school teammates? \nA: The person who never quit, no matter how hard it got. To say stick through it and in the end it will all be worth it. \nQuick hits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:31:26.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
