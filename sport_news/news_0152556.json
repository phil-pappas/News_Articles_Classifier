But it does give him a, shall we say, distinctive look.\n“The autograph-seekers definitely know who I am,” Keuchel said Monday. “And that kind of gets a little tiring after a while. But, I mean, I prefer to go unnoticed.”\nIt’s kind of hard not to notice the beard that would make Abe Lincoln appear clean-shaven in comparison. Keuchel, one of the top candidates for the American League Cy Young Award after his 20-8 season, began growing the beard last year on a dare from two buddies. The beard grew, along with a successful major league résumé. So he couldn’t cut it then.\nOr this season when he started the All-Star Game for the American League.\n“I don’t have the beard to be noticed. It’s just I can’t let it go right now,” Keuchel said. “But Manhattan is so big that I’m just another Joe.”\nIn Houston, he’s just another superstar with a beard that forces him to eat soup very carefully. Rockets star James Harden is something of a bearded celeb, but no, Keuchel has not sought grooming tips — though he has his beard regularly trimmed and pampered with high-class shampoo and conditioner that you don’t just pick up at the local dollar store.\n“I just met Harden for the first time when he threw out the first pitch second to last week of the season. We really didn’t talk about our beards,” Keuchel said. “But I’ll just say what a pleasure it was to meet him and obviously he’s one of the best basketball players on the planet. So anytime he’ll allow me to go over to the Toyota Center, or something, maybe shoot some hoops, it will be greatly appreciated. He had a pretty nasty cutter that he threw me up there, that first pitch.”\n  dallas keuchel ,  houston astros ,  james harden ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:09:08.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
