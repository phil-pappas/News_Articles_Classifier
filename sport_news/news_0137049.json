Methot felt \"funny\" after Thursday's game in Pittsburgh, during which he did take a \"bump\" but nothing that appeared serious. He took part in Saturday's morning skate, but then was a late scratch for that night's game against Nashville, when it was announced only that he was sick.\n\"It looked like there was flu symptoms, and that's all it was,\" said Murray. \"As we went further, and the last day or so, we realized that he does have a concussion.\"\nAt least Methot's situation doesn't appear to be as serious. He skated before practice Tuesday, then had an off-ice workout. Afterwards, he was in good spirits as he left the rink.\nThe plan is for Methot to practice with the team on Wednesday, but he won't play in Thursday's home game against the New Jersey Devils.\n\"He will be tested on Thursday morning and could be available as early as Saturday,\" said Murray. \"That's the hope.\"\nThe concern is greater for MacArthur, who also suffered a \"head injury\" that wasn't deemed to be a concussion during a collision with teammate Mark Fraser in a pre-season game.\n\"Clarke was great until that incident with Robin Lehner last year,\" said Murray, referring to a Feb. 18 goal crease crash that concussed both players. \"And then he had the bump, really, just in training camp with Fraser. It seemed to be fairly innocent ... he got a little bit of a neck thing out of it, and that was all. He was laughing that we even suggested it might be a concussion.\"\nWhile MacArthur was unavailable for comment, Murray said he is \"disappointed, frustrated, upset.\"\n\"But those feelings I think will go away, and I think at some point here he'll get into rehab and we'll take our time with him,\" said Murray. \"He's not feeling great, so yeah, we're concerned. There's no question when you get into head injuries, that it's something we're more cautious about than ever. We're going to wait until Clarke feels that he can really play, and be symptom free.\"\nLosing two veterans with the abilities of MacArthur and Methot is a big blow to a Senators team that is off to a ho-hum 3-3-0 start. Chris Wideman will get in his second game as Methot's replacement Thursday, when Shane Prince will play his third subbing in for MacArthur.\n\"We saw (Wideman) play last year and we thought he could play at this level, given a chance,\" said Murray. \"He looked fine the other night, I think it's just a matter of the coach having confidence to put him on the ice in different situations. He's certainly not going to be the guy who's going to kill penalties, like Erik Karlsson isn't very often. But with the puck, certainly the power play if needed ...\n\"I thought he conducted himself quite well for his first game. I think like every young player, they just get better as they go forward.\"\nWideman admitted he played a conservative game in his debut.\n\"I think I'm just laying a foundation now,\" he said. \"I think the first couple of games, I just try to make simple, smart plays and expand from there. I'm not looking to do crazy and out of the box. Just a good simple game and build every day.\"\nMeanwhile, Murray anticipates calling up another forward from Binghamton, as the Senators currently have no extra bodies around.\nThrough two games, Eric O'Dell leads the B-Sens with two goals, but Matt Puempel was Ottawa's last cut and figures to be first in line.\nPuempel has no points yet this season but in an interview on TSN1200's \"The Drive\" Tuesday afternoon, coach Luke Richardson said he has had a great attitude and some scoring chances.\n\"The main guy would probably be Puempel to get the first shot,\" Richardson guessed. \"The points aren't really telling the story.\"\nAt the same time, Richardson also pointed out that who gets called up \"depends on what type of role\" the Senators want filled.\nHe said a line of David Dziurzynski, Max McCormick and Zack Stortini has been very effective, especially in the team's first home game, a 4-3 victory over Syracuse.\n\"I think the other team was cringing,\" said Richardson. \"I think they intimidated a lot of guys.\"\nTwitter: @sundonib\nBRENNAN\nSenators Methot, MacArthur out with concussions\nBy Don Brennan , Ottawa Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 03:27 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 06:04 PM EDT\nWhen Clarke MacArthur staggered off the ice during last Wednesday's game in Columbus, his teammates felt sick for him.\nThey feared the popular Senators winger had the same type of injury that shelved him for almost a quarter of the 2014-15 season.\n\"My heart just dropped when I saw him (with) spaghetti legs,\" Zack Smith said Tuesday, moments after it was confirmed MacArthur has suffered his second concussion in eight months. \"He obviously had a hard time with it last year.\"\nWhile the diagnoses was no surprise, GM Bryan Murray revealed that defenceman Marc Methot also has a concussion.
