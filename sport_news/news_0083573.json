But in the bigger picture, his finish in the Full Throttle S'loonshine 98.9 doesn't matter as much as his start. As long as Enfinger takes the green flag in the No. 23 Champion Power Equipment Chevrolet in ARCA's final race of the season, he'll be the racing circuit's champion for 2015.\nEnfinger drives for GMS Racing, a team that also fields two entries for the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. At GMS Racing, Enfinger doesn't have to drive the hauler to and from the track, stay up all night working on his car or figure out how to make due with less than his competitors so he can stretch every dollar to the max.\nBut the Fairhope native has done all those things to get in position for a championship season.\n\"I think it makes me appreciate the position I'm in,\" Enfinger said. \"When I came over to GMS Racing, that stuff kind of stopped. I'm still an active crew member at the shop. We'll work from 7 to 5, 7 to 6 every day, but I don't drive the hauler anymore and I don't have to do some of the crazy stuff like work all night and all that. There's a huge support group at GMS Racing, and it's led by a lot of smart guys that we can lean on every day. That part of it is huge, but the fact that I have been through some of that stuff and rubbing pennies together to go racing, I feel like I appreciate the whole position I've been in this whole year even more, and I'm definitely able to probably savor the championship a little bit better that way.\"\nWith the championship in sight, Enfinger, 30, said he can't help but think about all the people who have helped him along the way, and he hopes they will feel a part of his achievement. He got his racing start in karts at age 11 at the old J&J Speedway (now Sunny South Raceway) in Grand Bay. He went on to legend and late-model racing while graduating from South Alabama along the way. He made his first ARCA start in 2008, and he's also raced six times in the NASCAR truck series.\n\"This whole championship this year is a big deal to me personally and me career-wise, but it's also a huge deal for everybody at GMS,\" Enfinger said. \"They've put a lot of faith in me, and it means a lot to be able to give some of that back.\n\"It's something we've worked long and hard at and there's been a lot of sacrifice by a lot of people. More than anything, it's a matter of kind of paying some of them back for all the hard work that everybody's put in this deal -- not only the guys here currently at GMS, who have done everything in the world for me, but everybody that's helped me in my career. I'm looking forward to it. I think we've got a lot of hillbillies from Alabama coming up here, so I'm looking forward to a good time.\"\nEnfinger enters the final race of the season 320 points ahead of Josh Williams, who is second in the ARCA season standings. Enfinger amassed 4,620 points in 19 races, with six victories and four second-place, 11 top-five and 15 top-10 finishes.\nHis 2015 season closely mirrors his 2014 campaign. He won the same number of races this year as last year, including sweeping the first three of the season for the second year in a row. Enfinger repeated his 2014 ARCA wins at Daytona, Mobile, Berlin, DuQuoin and Salem in 2015. But last year, Enfinger finished as the series runner-up to champion Mason Mitchell.\n\"This year compared to last year, I feel like we had probably the same amount of ups and downs, but we were able to salvage more out it this year,\" Enfinger said. \"We had quit a few goofy things happen to us. I accidentally hit the kill switch a couple of races ago at Salem and coasted to a stop. Our pit crew and crew chief were able to say kill switch on the radio and triggered my mind. The engine fired back up, and we were able to come back from the tail end and actually win that race. I bet you in over a quarter of the races, something crazy has happened, but everybody has remained calm. I think that's probably been the biggest difference from this year to last year.\"\nIn his first 44 ARCA races, Enfinger finished second four times and third 10 times, but he didn't win once. In his past 46 ARCA races, Enfinger has won 14 times, starting with the ARCA Mobile 200 at Mobile International Speedway in 2013.\n\"Before we got that first win, we'd kind of been on the verge, but we struggled sealing the deal,\" Enfinger said. \"Once we were able to get that first win at Mobile, it seemed to do a little bit for my confidence and kind of showed our guys we knew we could do this, but now we've done it. I think it relieved a little pressure and let everybody focus more on what we were trying to do.\"\nEnfinger's drive from J&J Speedway to the ARCA championship hasn't been a straight line or even four left turns. He ran the entire ARCA schedule in 2011 and finished fourth in the standings, then drove in about a third of the series' races over the next two years. He started driving for GMS Racing with nine races left in the 2014 season and, with backing from Allegiant Travel, Robertsdale's Triple K Construction and Worth USA, climbed to the ARCA championship this season. But given the economics of racing, he can't say what he'll be dong next year.\n\"Definitely, I haven't gone about this whole racing deal the easy way, I don't feel like,\" Enfinger said. \"There's been a lot of ups and down. It's hard to say what's going to happen in 2016. The main focus of this whole year has been getting us to this point here. Saturday morning, we'll start working on our 2016 stuff and kind of seeing what the future holds.\"\nFOX Sports 1 will televise the ARCA race at Kansas Speedway starting at 7:30 p.m. CDT Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:32:28.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
