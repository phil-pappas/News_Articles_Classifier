At least one Giants receiver is on course to play on Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nOn Thursday afternoon, receiver Rueben Randle, who injured his hamstring in the Sunday victory over the San Francisco 49ers , said he expects to suit up on Monday night.\n“My thoughts: Yeah,” Randle said. “I don’t see myself sitting out this game.”\nRELATED: GIANTS AGAIN ASK FOR MORE FROM RANDLE\nThat’s good news for a Giants passing attack that’s shrouded in uncertainty , with Odell Beckham Jr. unsure if he’ll be able to play through his own hamstring injury and with Victor Cruz continuing an arduously slow recovery from a left calf strain that’s nagged since mid-August.\nCruz wasn’t even on the practice field on Thursday, and Beckham ran off to the side, doing only straight-line work. But Randle managed to be active during the portion of practice open to the media, even handling some half-speed one-on-one drills.\n“I was a little limited,” he said. “But I got my work in too . . . Today, I tested it. It’s a little sore now. But it’s getting better, so as long as I’m progressing (that’s good).”\n* * *\nThe Giants’ top three receivers are banged up, they’ve played without their veteran left tackle (Will Beatty) all season, and they just lost another cornerback in Prince Amukamara , who tore a pectoral and will miss 2-4 weeks.\nBut no, said Tom Coughlin, the club isn’t planning to instantly change any of its conditioning policies, which were already revamped to include a Friday “spa”-style rest day this offseason.\n“It’s not a time to change now,” said Coughlin. “For years, we did it one way. (Now) we’re doing it this way, we’re going to stay with it. We’re going to see how it goes.”\nCoughlin did admit that yet another season full of injuries has been “very bothersome.”\n“We’ve inserted major changes, we’ve changed pretty much everything that we do, starting with the GPS,” he said, referring to the club’s new system of tracking exactly how far and hard players run during each and every practice. “But all these soft tissue injuries are very, very troublesome, occurring in games, if you will. And then being so long and trying to get people back. I’m not going to get frustrated by it, but it’s very bothersome.”\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n* * *\nCruz (calf/knee) still has not be cleared to practice, Coughlin said . . .
