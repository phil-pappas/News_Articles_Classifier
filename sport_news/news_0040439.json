Bryant left the third quarter of Tuesday’s game against Sacramento after getting kneed in his left leg.\nBut Lakers coach Byron Scott dismissed any concern about the seriousness surrounding Bryant’s health even if he played only 41 games in the past two seasons amid season-ending injuries to his left knee and right shoulder. Scott called Bryant’s left leg “a little sore” and chalked up his absence as “precautionary.” Bryant did not speak to reporters on Thursday and Friday.\n“If it was a regular-season game, there’d be a much better chance of him playing,” Scott said of Bryant, who will stay home on Saturday after receiving treatment. “But since it’s not, there’s no need for him to play.”\nStill, Bryant’s absence has changed the team dynamic.\nGuard Jordan Clarkson noticed the practice intensity on Thursday and Friday changed “a little bit” before noting “everybody’s going hard.” Rookie point guard D’Angelo Russell will also change how he runs the offense after Bryant averaged 13 points on 44.6 percent shooting in 18.2 minutes through five exhibition games. Russell said he will look to score more “if it’s the right play.”\nScott said he has not decided on his starting lineup. But he outlined clear steps Bryant must take before practicing.\n“The biggest thing is being able to get lift off,” Scott said. “He said going on his tippy toes was a little sore. We want to see if he can get all of that out first before he gets back.”\nInjury update\nA strained right hamstring may have tested Marcelo Huertas’ patience in appearing in his first NBA game. But the Lakers’ 32-year-old guard also played 11 years in Spain before cracking an NBA roster.\nThe Lakers listed Huertas as probable to play on Saturday against the Warriors after practicing on Thursday and Friday.\n“He’s a good controlled guard,” Clarkson said. “He doesn’t do much more [than he can]. He gets in the lane, shoots a lot of floaters and off-the-leg stuff. He can definitely pass the ball.”\nDelayed decision\nScott said he and general manager Mitch Kupchak will make roster cuts “probably next week.” The Lakers have to trim their 19-man roster to at least 15 by their season opener on Oct. 28.\nAdvertisement\nNew look\nRussell has not just encountered adjustments in both adapting to the NBA and excelling as both a starter and reserve. Russell also adjusted his hairstyle, sporting cornrows and a headband in Friday’s practice.\n“I wanted to be different for a little bit, maybe just for preseason,” Russell said. “Maybe I’ll take it out.”\nApparently, Lakers forward Nick Young questioned the look despite having his own eclectic fashion style.\n“He was going to do it next. He wants to be just like me. I’m just kidding,” Russell joked. “He just said, ‘I don’t think this is something you’d do for a while. But if you’re just experimenting with your head, I agree with it.’”\nAbout the Author Reach the author at mark.medina@dailynews.com or follow Mark on Twitter: @MarkG_Medina .\nFull bio and more articles by Mark Medina Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laedit.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=35", "http://www.insidesocal.com/lakers/2015/09/30/lakers-nick-young-vows-to-have-a-turnaround-season/", "http://twitter.com/MarkG_Medina"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:44:36.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
