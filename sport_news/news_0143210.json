The New York Yankees spawned that phrase when they bounced players to and from their minor-league team in Ohio.\nThe New Jersey Devils have their own pipeline between Newark and Albany, but the transition between teams seems to be smooth for the players.\nThat was evident Saturday night as the Albany Devils opened their American Hockey League home schedule with a 3-1 victory over the Portland Pirates at Times Union Center.\nLeft wing Reid Boucher , sent down by the NHL club Wednesday, scored a goal. Defenseman Seth Helgeson , the last cut from training camp, set up another as the Devils, after starting the season with four road games, were welcomed back by 5,335 fans.\n\"Just about everything's the same,\" Boucher said of the playing style of the two clubs. \"Maybe a few changes here and there, but it's not like (you're) coming down and not knowing what's going on.\"\nBoucher and Helgeson were among 13 players last season who played at least one game for both Devils teams. Players were taught the same systems of play in New Jersey and Albany.\nThe New Jersey management has changed this season, as Ray Shero replaced Lou Lamoriello as general manager, and the playing style is different. What hasn't been altered is the philosophy of having the same principles at both levels of hockey.\n\"It's probably as smooth as it's ever been,\" Albany coach Rick Kowalsky said of the transition for players sent down. \"That's something that was mandated from the top. We wanted to be as close to the same as we can.\n\"(There can be) tweaks within a game, but they've made it clear that they want communication to be open. Maybe there's something we're doing down here and an adjustment we made that can help them. It's pretty transparent that way, and it's been beneficial for us.\"\nHelgeson looks to be the same player whether he's in the NHL, which he was for 22 games last season, or in Albany.\nHe isn't a scoring machine, but he knows what is expected, exhibited Saturday when he had the puck at the right point. Helgeson got the puck through to the front of the net, where rookie Blake Pietila tipped it home.\n\"My mentality and the way that I play doesn't change,\" Helgeson said. \"I come down here and being with a different group of guys, it's the same system. I'm comfortable and familiar with the coaching staff.\"\nThere are a handful of new players in the organization, but Boucher and Helgeson became familiar with most of them in training camp.\nIt was Mike Sislo , in his fifth season with Albany, whose backhand pass found Boucher in the slot for the game's first goal.\n\"It was good to see him score,\" Kowalsky said. \"He relies on that quite a bit for his confidence. With 'Bouch,' it's more about his play without the puck and getting in and playing a pace and energy game.\"\nTwo players who were in other organizations last season combined for Albany's third goal, which came on a power play. Corey Tropp , on loan from the Chicago Blackhawks , was in front of the net when he sent a blind pass to Jim O'Brien , who notched his second of the season. O'Brien finished last season with the AHL's Hershey Bears.\nGoaltender Yann Danis , who ended last season in Hartford, made 19 saves, losing his shutout bid on Michael Matteson 's goal with 2:16 remaining.\nPortland, affiliated with the Florida Panthers , relocated from San Antonio and is under the direction of former Albany River Rats coach Tom Rowe .\n\"We're trying to figure out what teams do now,\" Rowe said. \"In the west, we were there for, what, four or five years? You get to know people and tendencies. It's a little different, but it's not why we lost. We lost because Albany played better.\"\npdougherty@timesunion.com • 518-454-5416 • @Pete_Dougherty \nDEVILS 3, PIRATES 1 \nPortland 0 0 1 — 1\nAlbany 0 2 1 — 3\nFirst period — No scoring.
