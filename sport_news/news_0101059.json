Its just Mildred.\"\nThe business, which started in 1915, began as a hardware store and garage and is still in business 100 years later as a general store\n Regena Lance, co-owner of the store says its stayed in business so long because, \"People from everywhere, miles and miles around come to this for the sandwiches, for the piece of history, and when it was a booming community a lot of people come home to this area.\"\nThe business was started by Scott Brown, and up until last year the store had remained in the same family. It's said, the store serves a small rural community, and when it hosts its weekly music nights the population quadruples.\n \"One of our biggest nights was 110 people not counting the band and the little kids, so in one night a town of 28 went to over 120,\" said Regena, who hopes they remain in business for another century more.\n The son of the former owner of charlie browns general store said future prospects of the store look great, \"It'll never be a Wal-Mart and it will probably not be a supermarket but it will be able to grow and grow and grow.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:47:57.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
