Christian Trauger got things started for Reading with a perfectly placed onside kick that was recovered by Dan McGrath. On Reading’s first offensive play, Brendan Disilva swept around right end and followed the devastating blocks of Ben Mason and McGrath for an untouched 50-yard score. Colin Duross then found Jay Kajander for the extra point. Reading’s defense proved equally formidable on its opening series, especially the defensive line of Thomas Keane, Matt Gorman, Dom Decrescenzo, Mason, Duross and Kajander, who punished the Dracut backs. Reading’s second score came almost as quickly as the first. It took the offense only two plays to go 50 yards for a touchdown, when Duross followed the great blocks of Matt Hammond and Jack Blumenshine, before breaking several tackles near the goal line to complete his 30-yard scoring jaunt. After a long touchdown pass by Dracut cut the lead to 14-6, Reading closed out the first half with a 12-play, 65-yard scoring drive. The offensive line of Zach Barbo, Trevor Zupan, Vincent Sullivan, Kajankder, B.J. Gemellaro, Chris Chiulli and Mason opened up some huge running lanes for the backs. Sullivan then finished the drive with a one-yard plunge into the end zone. Any hopes of a Dracut comeback were quickly dashed at the start of the second half, when Blumenshine fielded an attempted onside kick cleanly, before Duross followed the great blocks of Evan Long, Chiulli, Gemellaro and Mason that resulted in a 55-yard touchdown run. The Reading defense controlled the majority of the second half as linebackers McGrath, Disilva and Gemellaro led the hard-hitting crew, while cornerbacks Jason Conroy and Long shutdown the Dracut receivers. Disilva and Duross then scored their second touchdowns of the game, and a Trauger kick accounted for the final score. Conroy, Chiulli, Hammond and Blumenshine ran the ball efficiently down the stretch to secure the win, and a McGrath interception thwarted Dracut’s last attempt to score points. The Reading Junior Rockets now take their winning record of 3-1 on the road to Chelmsford to face the Lions Sunday. B-team Rockets drop thriller to Dracut The B-team Rockets lost a hard fought battle with the Dracut Middies, 7-6 Oct. 4. It was a game played between the 20-yard lines, and it was not settled until the last drive by the Middies. Dracut opened up the game with an eight-minute drive, but the tough Reading defense, led by Jeremy Rosh, Matt Segalla and Shaun Bekkenhuis, stopped them in its tracks outside the red zone. Page 2 of 3 - The teams exchanged long drives throughout the half until Troy Pollack returned an interception to the Dracut 20. Though the Rockets could sense the end zone, the clock ran out before they could score. In the second half, the Rockets seemingly were gaining momentum when Keith Richmond sacked the Dracut quarterback for a 10-yard loss on fourth down. The Reading offense then punched the ball downfield, and scored on a 12-yard run by Pollack. Blocks by Adam Diemer, Derek Van Horn, Anthony Massucci and Andrew Hattery sprung Pollack free to the end zone. But then, the Middies went on the offensive, and scored with seconds left on the clock, and a successful two-yard, two-point conversion completed the scoring that decided the game. C-team takes on Dracut The visiting Dracut Titans pinned the first loss of the season on the C-team last Sunday. Dracut went three and out on its first drive after a fumbled snap and a huge tackle for a loss by Dylan Fadale. Unfortunately for the Reading offense, they weren't much better. They also went three and out. Dracut got untracked on its next drive with several good short pounding runs right up the middle that resulted in a touchdown. Reading’s next drive seemed promising, with Stephen Donnelly, Dana Isbell and Colby Goodchild running hard, but then the Rockets fell short after a five-yard reception by Ben Reggazzinni that wasn't good enough for a first down. Dracut led at the half, 7-0. The Rockets received the ball to start the second half, but Dracut forced another three and out. The Rockets defense, led by Jake Skeehan, Dan Robinson, Jack Keefe and Colin Williamson, seemingly stopped Dracut, but a 45-yard touchdown pass on fourth and 14 culminated the drive to give the Middies a 14-0 lead. Reading showed promise on its next drive, when quarterback Nick Perez successfully hooked up with Colby Goodchild and Andrew Benassi, but an interception ended the threat. Dracut then moved the ball well again, but a series of illegal motion calls, and stout defense, led by Gabe Muniz, Ryan Segalla, Anthony Martignetti, Anthony Agahigian, Ryan Wallace, Justin Holmes and Miguel Martin, caused a turnover on downs. But time ran out before the offense could do anything. The Titans ended the Rockets three-game winning streak, but Coach Chuck Robinson's team is confident that they will return to their winning ways this Sunday. E-team looks good versus Dracut The E-team was impressive against Dracut last Sunday with an outstanding defense and an offense that scored hard fought touchdowns. Dylan Sigsbury and Andrew Jackvony, who had several long runs, also accounted for the touchdowns. In his first week at center, Mark Tango did a great job snapping the ball. Page 3 of 3 - The defensive line came up with several big stops behind the line of scrimmage. Reily Learned, Adrian Muniz, Ryan O'Malley, Franklin Travassos and Brady Comenos were stalwarts along the defensive line, and safety Daniel Agami also had a solid outing. The E-team will now hit the road for Chelmsford this Sunday to face the Lions. Ryan F. Flanagan compiled the C-team report.
