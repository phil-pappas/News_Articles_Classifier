Grace Beahm/Staff × For the first time in two years, The Post and Courier’s Andrew Miller was perfect in his high school football picks. Trailing ABC News 4 sports anchor Scott Eisberg for most of the season, Miller picked all six games correctly last week. “What can I say, I’m the greatest,” the always humble Miller said. Eisberg? Well, he went just 2-4. However, Eisberg has gone 6-0 twice over the last two years. Miller now holds a 30-18 to 27-21 advantage over his counterpart. Our two prognosticators differ on just one game this week: Stratford at West Ashley Eisberg: Marion Bowl Part 2. Joe Marion (Stratford) vs. Bobby Marion (West Ashley). It’s a very interesting game. I was convinced by Stratford’s win over Wando. I’ll pick Joe. Stratford, 28-21. Miller: The winner is still in the hunt for the Region 7-AAAA title. Both teams have been up-and-down all season and are coming off impressive wins. West Ashley, 23-20. Summerville at Colleton County Eisberg: Four straight losses for the Wave, three straight losses for the Cougars. Wave are due, they’ll win in Walterboro. Summerville, 35-10. Miller: Both teams in desperate need of a win. Summerville has two weeks to prepare and that will be the difference. Summerville, 27-22. Wando at Goose Creek Eisberg: Amazing what an overtime win will do for confidence. Goose Creek’s win over Cane Bay was big. I’m on the Gator train this week. Goose Creek, 42-24. Miller: It took a little longer than expected, but the Gators are back on track. A huge win last week against Cane Bay and the Warriors were just beat up after playing three games in 10 days against Stratford. Goose Creek, 34-20. Cane Bay at James Island Eisberg: Last week was the roughest outing of the Ike Allred era at James Island. I think the Trojans use it as a wake-up call, but it’s just not enough against the Cobras. Cane Bay, 24-21 Miller: Cane Bay gave Goose Creek it’s biggest scare in recent memory in Region 7-AAAA. Know the Cobras are about moral victories, but OT loss to Gators is a big step for program. Cane Bay, 33-16. Bluffton at Fort Dorchester Eisberg: Bluffton is a pretty good team, but not good enough this week. Anything but a state title would be a disappointment for Steve LaPrad’s Patriots this year. Fort Dorchester, 55-14 Miller: There are two elite teams in Region 8-AAAA — Fort Dorchester and Ashley Ridge. Bluffton is trying to become one of those programs. Not this year. Fort Dorchester, 44-20. Bishop England at North Charleston Eisberg: Good start for North Charleston, but Cougars are tailing off, Bishops are only getting better each week. Bishop England, 42-10. Miller: The Bishops’ tough non-conference schedule paying huge dividends as they enter Region 6-AA play. Bishop England, 32-18. Eisberg: 2-4 last week. 27-21 overall Miller: 6-0 last week. 30-18 overall", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:03:03.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
