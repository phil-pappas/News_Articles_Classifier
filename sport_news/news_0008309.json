No right thinking person can ever rationalise and condone such an action. Such incidents bring a bad name to the country.\"\nSubsequent to this, a series of writers have returned awards conferred on them by the Sahitya Academy on grounds that an atmosphere of intolerance has been created under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\"Is this protest real or a manufactured one? Is this not a case of ideological intolerance?,\" he asked.\nJaitley said a large number of writers with left or Nehruvian leaning had been recognised by the government in the past.\n\"Some of them may have been entitled to this recognition. I am neither questioning their academic merits nor their right to have political prejudices. Many of them have spoken out against the present Prime Minister even when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat,\" he said.\nBut after Modi came to power in May last year, \"those who had enjoyed the patronage under the earlier establishment, have obviously been uncomfortable with the present government.\"\nThis \"discomfort\", he said had been furthered by shrinking fortunes of the Congress.\n\"The new strategy of anti-Modi, anti-BJP sections appears to be to resort to 'politics by other means'. The easiest way is to manufacture a crisis and subsequently manufacture a paper rebellion against the Government in the wake of a manufactured crisis,\" he wrote.
