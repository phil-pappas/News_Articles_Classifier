But based on my experience as president, I can’t guarantee that. And that’s terrible to say. And it can change,” President Obama said to reporters .\nPresident Obama expressed his frustration over the lack of gun control legislation Thursday following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon.\n“We are the only advanced country that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months,” Obama said.\nAccording to The Washington Post , it’s more like every month this year. The Post reports the U.S. has seen 294 mass shootings so far in 2015.\n“At this time, we are reporting and can confirm 10 fatalities in the shooting, seven additional injuries … and three of those that were critically injured,” Douglas County Sheriff Jon Hanlin told reporters .\nOregon State Police say the shooting was first reported at 10:38 a.m. Pacific time.\n“It was in the science building. They put the entire campus on lockdown,” Roseburg Beacon reporter David Jaques told CNN .\n“Next thing you know, my friend’s running in from outside saying there was a shooting and someone is shooting on campus and people are being shot,” Umpqua Community College Student Lacey Gregory told KOIN .\nThe News-Review out of Roseburg interviewed a student who witnessed the shooting. She said the shooter reportedly “told people to get on the ground. The shooter was asking people to stand up and state their religion and then started firing away.”\nDouglas County Sheriff Jon Hanlin said the shooter was a 20-year-old man who was killed when he exchanged gunfire with police.

She also said the school has a “no guns on campus” policy. (Video via The Oregonian )\nState police, local agencies, the FBI and U.S. Marshals, to name a few, all responded to the shooting. Authorities say it’ll be another 24 to 48 hours until they release the names of the victims killed in Thursday’s shooting.
