The Central Bearcats needed a miracle Friday night against visiting McCutcheon, and they almost got one. \nJamel Barnes, a wide receiver, heaved a 42-yard bomb to Gino Taylor on a trick play down the right sideline to set the Bearcats up at the 15-yard line with six seconds left, but Devon McNabb's 32-yard field goal attempt was just wide right, and McCutcheon held on to win 16-14 in a North Central Conference contest. \nIt's a play Central (4-4, 3-3) rehearses every Thursday in case of emergency, and it desperately needed it Friday night on its own 43 with 15 seconds to play. \n\"Usually when you draw stuff up,\" the left-handed Barnes said, \"it doesn't happen like you want it to happen. \n\"Sometimes in practice, I think about (throwing it) it. Coach just told me not to think about it, it's all up here,\" he added, pointing to his head. \"I just threw it.\" \nThat set up McNabb, who hooked the kick just outside the right upright. \n\"To be honest, that was a hard kick,\" Central coach Adam Morris said. \"Right hash, he's left-footed to it's just awkward. It was a great kick. It didn't go in, but it was a great kick. It's tough because it was that close.\" \nLeVon Thompson's 26-yard touchdown put McCutcheon up 16-7 with 8:32 left, but Central tailback Andre Wells set up Xavier Cleaves' 6-yard scoring run. Linebackers Vince Coleman and Austin Johnson led a defensive stand to get the Bearcats the ball back with 2:45 left. \nBut in nine plays, Central moved the ball just 23 yards. So Morris went into his bag of tricks, even though he was overruled by his offensive assistants. \n\"They were trying to call one trick play, and I wanted to run the other one,\" he said with a laugh. \"We were arguing, and I said, 'I don't care, just run a trick play.' We can't just keep trying to dink and dunk, it wasn't going to work.\" \nDefeat aside, Central played one of its cleanest games all season, committing just one penalty for five yards while not turning the ball over. \n\"I think we're starting to come together as a whole,\" said quarterback Trenton Hatfield, who ran for a 10-yard score in the third quarter. \"The defense is coming together. One of our downfalls has been consistency on both sides of the ball, and I think we've improved on that tremendously. This game shows it.\" \nTyler Packard led McCutcheon (5-3, 5-1) with 95 yards on 13 carries while Thompson added 81 on eight attempts. \nThe Mavericks allowed Wells to rush for 151 yards on 26 carries, which was actually 30 yards under his average. Most importantly, they didn't allow the 6-foot-2, 205-pound back to spring loose for any long runs, as he has often done this season. \nThat wasn't enough for McCutcheon coach Ken Frauhiger, though, who wanted to hold Wells under 60 yards. \n\"We focused on it all week, so we should be able to stop it. We did a great job in the first half, but I thought second half we got very tentative. \nWhen told Wells ended up with 151 yards, Frauhiger responded, \"I think I'm going to go throw", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:35:42.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
