Community College helped him develop personally and figure out what his next move would be to return to Division I football. \n\"It helped a lot,\" said Kamara, who has 255 yards on 45 carries this season behind sophomore Jalen Hurd . \"It kind of knocked me down to the ground a little bit. It made me a little bit stronger, made me work harder.\" Hurd, Kamara a potent 1-2 punch in Vols opener \nKamara said he sometimes catches himself looking in awe at Tennessee's weight room after taking such luxuries for granted at the start of his career at Alabama. He also appreciates getting to eat at a big-time college training table after a season at the junior college level. \nIn advance of Tennessee's game at No. 8 Alabama on Saturday (2:30 p.m., CBS), Kamara has acted as a self-described \"insider,\" helping his teammates learn details about the Crimson Tide that might not show up on game tape. He said he's been answering \"little questions about how they play, how they're thinking on the field.\" \n\"Anything I can do to help these guys and give them an edge, that’s what I’m doing,\" Kamara said. \nThe Vols have lost eight in a row to the Crimson Tide. Alabama games significant in Josh Dobbs' career \nKamara said he sometimes wonders what would have happened had he not torn his lateral meniscus prior to his season at Alabama. Had he not, it's possible he'd be competing with another bruising, Hurd-like running back for carries this season. The Crimson Tide's Derrick Henry, with whom Kamara still keeps in touch, is seventh in the nation with 901 rushing yards this season. He also has more rushing touchdowns (12) than all but three players. \nAlabama coach Nick Saban said there was some frustration on Kamara's part after the knee scope caused him to miss the first few weeks of the season. Kamara redshirted and never appeared in a game for the Crimson Tide. \n\"There was no question about the fact that he was an outstanding player,\" Saban said. \"He was doing extremely well for us and was probably going to play as a freshman.\" \nKamara downplayed the notion that he'll be playing with additional motivation this week, though he jokingly said he \"might not be friends after the game\" with his former teammates. \n\"Alvin is a very determined, very confident young man, but he's very focused ... and he doesn't talk much about the past,\" Tennessee coach Butch Jones said. \"Everything is about the present and moving forward, and that's what I like about him.\" SPANNING THE SEC: Check in for the latest news, notes, scores and more for one of college football's best conferences ! \nHurd probable: The flu virus that prevented Hurd from practicing Wednesday is \"not a real big concern,\" according to Jones. \nHurd was expected to be a full participant in Wednesday's practice, which was closed to the media. Jones said he anticipates Hurd being available for Saturday's game. \nReach Matt Slovin at mslovin@tennessean.com or on Twitter @MattSlovin . \nSUPER SUBS \nSEC's top No. 2 running backs by yardage: \n1.
