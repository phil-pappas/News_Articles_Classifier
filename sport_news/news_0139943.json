Nobody knows that more than the Sixers floor general Isaiah Canaan, who will be looking to get the ball down low to the team’s big men Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel. And when the ball rotates back to Canaan, he has to be able to knock down the open jump shot. The 6-foot, 201-pounder, is looking forward to leading the Sixers’ backcourt. \n“Well, first it’s an honor to be a starting point guard in the NBA,” Canaan said. “I’m grateful for that and to go out and lead a young group. It’s a blessing. I’m thankful every day to have this opportunity to go out and play the game I love.” \nThe Sixers acquired Canaan in a trade with the Houston Rockets last season. He came to the Sixers along with a second round pick for K.J. McDaniels. In 22 games, he had 12 starts with the Sixers. He averaged 12.6 points, 3.1 assists and 2.5 rebounds in 25.9 minutes. \nCanaan, 24, had to roll up his sleeves in order to get to this stage of his NBA career. Canaan played his college basketball at Murray State from 2009-2013. As a freshman, he was named the 2010 Ohio Valley Conference freshman of the year. He was a three-time first team All-OVC selection. In addition, he was a two-time conference player of the year. \nCanaan helped to raise the profile of Murray State’s basketball program. During his college career, he guided the Racers to two NCAA and one NIT appearance. Of course, the big season was 2012 when the Racers were ranked No. 9 in the nation and had a 23-game winning streak. The streak was snapped by Tennessee State, 72-68, at Murray State. That game was interesting because it featured Canaan’s good friend and teammate Robert Covington. Murray State had an unbelievable year posting a 31-2 mark. \n“Rob and I talk about that game all the time,” Canaan said. “It was a big win for Tennessee State.” \nCanaan was a second round pick of the Houston Rockets in the 2013 NBA draft. Covington signed with the Rockets that same year as an undrafted free agent. Canaan and Covington played for the Rio Grande Vipers in the NBA Development League before they made their path to the NBA. Covington knows Canaan’s basketball talents as well as anybody on the Sixers. \n“He’s an all-around player,” Covington said. “I’ve known Isaiah for years now. We played against each other in college. Isaiah has been a tremendous player. He’s very talented. He just comes in and works hard. I’ve known him a long time. Our friendship has really grown. It has made us like brothers. Our relationship is very secure.” \nThe Sixers will play their final   Boston Celtics on Friday, Oct. 23. They will open the NBA regular season against the Celtics on Wednesday, Oct. 28 at TD Garden in Boston (7:30 p.m. CSN). \nCanaan picked up some valuable playing time last year. He spent a lot of time during the offseason preparing for this season. \n“I just worked on everything,” Canaan said. “I worked on my ballhandling. I wanted to get better in that area. Of course, my strength is shooting. I just tried to work on everything and watch a lot of film and learn from some of the better guards in the league.” \ndhunt@phillytrib.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:08:35.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
