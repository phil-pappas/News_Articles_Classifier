(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Lady Liberators of Bolivar took care of business Wednesday on their home court to clinch their first district title in girls tennis since 2011 by defeating Catholic 5-1. Before today, Bolivar had already defeated Catholic twice this season. Bolivar head tennis coach Jennifer Nutt knew that beating a team three times in one season would not be an easy task.\"We knew it was going to be a tough match going into it because it's hard to beat a team three times in one season,\" said Nutt after Bolivar clinched the Class 1 District 9 title. \"Our girls were up for the challenge though, and played some of the best tennis I have seen them play all season.\" CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE MATCH From the other side of the spectrum, Catholic head tennis coach, Martin Versteeg knew that to beat Bolivar they would need to play their best tennis of the season.\"They (Bolivar) are really solid. They have a lot of seniors on that team that have been here before, and I think some of them have even been to state,\" Versteeg said. \"Their one and two are both really strong. Our girls did a really good job and kept on going.\" The match started with doubles where the Lady Liberators came out of the gate running by taking two out of three from Catholic. The winners in doubles included Bolivar's number two doubles team Erica Reynolds and Macy Hall over Courtney Lee and Christina Rodriguez 8-1 and Bolivar's number three doubles team Jessie Gamble and Kennedy Hedges over Claire Layman and Cecilia Bailey 8-0. Catholic's number one doubles team of Anna Rader and Emily Kroutil defeated Bolivar's Momoka Kikuchi and Mary Grace Harris. It was then three single victories from Bolivar that led them to a district title. Winners in singles were Gamble over Lee (6-2, 6-1) and Hall over Layman (6-0, 6-2). Then Bolivar's Erica Reynolds defeated Christina Rodriguez (6-0, 6-0) to end the match.\"This is something we have worked for all four years. I have played varsity for three years, and each time we have fallen short,\" Bolivar senior Macy Hall said. \"So to be able to win districts my senior year is very special.\" The Lady Liberators will host individual districts on Friday, and then travel on Saturday to Logan-Rogersville to play the Wildcats for team sectionals.
