Brady tried to downplay the milestone after the game, steering the conversation toward team accomplishments.\nHowever, we’ve chosen to celebrate it. And in that vein, here is a list of Brady’s best regular-season — the 401 doesn’t include his 53 in the postseason — touchdown tosses.\nRandy Moss (65 yards) — DEC. 29, 2007 AT GIANTS\nResult : Won, 38-35\nSkinny : Brady’s 65-yard bomb down the right sideline at Giants Stadium was his 50th of the year, setting the NFL single-season record, and sealed the only 16-0 regular season ever. Despite the Super Bowl, it still stands as a crowning team and individual achievement.\nJermaine Wiggins (3 yards) — OCT. 14, 2001 VS. SAN DIEGO\nResult : Won, 29-26 (ot)\nSkinny : The first two touchdowns of Brady’s career came in this game, his fourth since replacing an injured Drew Bledsoe. Brady hit Wiggins to complete a 10-point fourth-quarter rally with 36 seconds left. It was the type of performance Patriots fans have come to expect, and this was their first glimpse. The fact Brady led the organization to its first Super Bowl win later that season cements the memory even further.\nJabar Gaffney (8 yards) — DEC. 3, 2007 at BALTIMORE\nResult : Won, 27-24\nSkinny : With the pressure of perfection building each week, Brady’s stat line was mediocre but not when a game hung in the balance. The Ravens led by a touchdown with less than nine minutes to go, but this catch — which was reviewed — with 55 seconds left stung the Ravens so much, Bart Scott drew an unsportsmanlike penalty.\nKevin Faulk (13 yards) — NOV. 4, 2007\nResult : Won, 24-20\nSkinny : Against Peyton Manning in Indianapolis, Brady pulled the team out of a 10-point hole in the last eight minutes. He threw two interceptions, but Faulk’s catch-and-run with 3:15 to play helped secure the win.\nRob Gronkowski (16 yards) — OCT. 5, 2014\nResult : Won, 43-17\nSkinny : The week following the embarrassing Monday Night Football loss to the Chiefs, the Patriots beat up Cincinnati at home. Brady became the sixth player to eclipse 50,000 career yards with this third-quarter toss to one of his favorite targets.\nKenbrell Thompkins (17 yards) — OCT. 13, 2013 VS. N.O.\nResult : Won, 30-27\nSkinny : Brady was average at best for most of this game. Gillette Stadium was emptying out when the Saints took a 27-23 lead with 2:24 to play on a field goal. More people left when Brady threw an interception on the next drive, but the Pats forced a punt, took over at their own 30 with 1:13 to play and Brady found Thompkins with :05 to go in one of the more stunning finishes he’s produced.\nTerry Glenn (21 yards) — OCT. 14, 2001 VS. S.D.\nResult : Won, 29-26 (ot)\nSkinny : The first may not be as memorable to fans as the second, but Brady won’t forget throwing his first pro touchdown. This second-quarter strike to a player who still holds the franchise’s rookie receiving yardage record — set in 1996 — illustrates just how long Brady’s been able to perform at a high level.\nRob Gronkowski (7 yards) — JAN. 1, 2012 VS. BUFFALO\nResult : Won, 49-21\nSkinny : If there were such a thing as a forgettable 300th career touchdown pass, this would qualify. After falling behind 21-0, the Patriots turned this one into a rout by the time Brady hit Gronkowski with 3:02 to play in the fourth quarter.\nAaron Hernandez (8 yards) — OCT. 16, 2011 VS. DALLAS\nResult : Won, 20-16\nSkinny : In a season in which the Pats fell moments short of their fourth Super Bowl title, the regular season did have a back-and-forth duel between Tony Romo and Brady, who hit Hernandez over the middle with 27 seconds to play.\nDavid Givens (18 yards) — NOV. 3, 2003 AT DENVER\nResult : Won, 30-26\nSkinny : On Monday Night Football, Brady engineered another late comeback in a hostile environment. Down by a field goal late, Brady’s 4-of-5 completions accounted for every yard of a drive that finished with the go-ahead score with 36 seconds left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:40:29.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
