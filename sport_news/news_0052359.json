But the County Seaters girls soccer team isn't afraid of going toe-to-toe with some big competition. \nFor the second straight week, the Group 1 school took on a Group 4 challenger. \nOn Saturday, the County Seaters took North Hunterdon to overtime before falling 1-0 in a Hunterdon/Warren/Sussex quarterfinal at Belvidere. \n\"I'm extremely proud of my players,\" Belvidere second-year coach Pete Huryk said. \"To go up against a Group 4 school and take them into overtime. To play the way the girls did, which isn't to just stand there and deflect pressure but try to go at them at times. I just couldn't be prouder of my girls. They played extremely well. We're not trying to play like a little school. We're trying to play like a better school, like a soccer school.\" \nThe week before the County Seaters challenged Hunterdon Central. And it wasn't because of how a tournament worked out. It was by choice. Pete Huryk (Courtesy Photo) \n\"The game against Hunterdon Central, we had a bye last weekend in the county tournament and so did they. And they looked for a team to play and we jumped right on it because we want to play against the bigger schools,\" Huryk said. \"We want to play against meaningful competition. Hunterdon Central is in a war every game they play. I used to coach there so I know what they go through. I want my girls to be playing at that level. In order to be the best, you have to beat the best.\" \nChristine Fox kept the County Seaters in the game against North Hunterdon, recording 15 saves, including a diving stop on Heather Tostevin with 7:10 left in regulation. The junior goalkeeper also made a stop in the final moments on a Rebecca Fontana direct kick before Tostevin got the rebound to end the game. \nBelvidere is now 9-4 on the season with two of its losses coming against Group 4 schools. \nHuryk, who coached at Hunterdon Central for four years, hopes his team's games against big schools will get the County Seaters ready for the state tournament, which starts in early November. \n\"We played against Hunterdon Central last weekend because we want to prove we can play,\" Huryk said. \"It doesn't matter the size of school, we'll take on anybody that comes our way. I'm getting my girls prepared for the state tournament. And we're not going to be playing against Group 4 schools in the state tournament. We're going to be playing against little guys like us. We're going to go at it with everybody.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:54:06.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
