Birney Crum Stadium in Allentown. \nThe victory advances the top seeded Green Hornets into Thursday’s title game against No. 2 Stroudsburg at a time and site to be determined. \nJunior Kira Koehler scored two goals for Emmaus (19-0) while Emily Ingalls and Laura Smerker added one goal each. Madalyn Dorn had the other assist. \nIn each of her assists, Sholder showed remarkable stick skills to penetrate through the heart of Easton’s defense and find an open teammate. After every goal, Sholder exuberantly jumps high in the air and pumps her fist in an unparalleled display of emotion. \nRELATED : Emmaus field hockey team anxious to get EPC title back from Stroudsburg \n“I don’t know why, I just get so happy when we score,” Sholder said. “It’s such an accomplishment to succeed like that and share it with my team.” \nEmmaus coach Sue Butz-Stavin, who earlier this season became the winningest field hockey coach in U.S. history, says that Sholder’s passion for the game is second to none. \n“That’s just her,” Butz-Stavin said. “That’s a natural reaction. She loves the game and she loves her teammates. She just enjoys seeing everyone else on the field succeed.” \nSholder also enjoys the challenge of playing in big games. \n“Anytime I play under the lights it gives me a lot of energy,” she said, “and this is the postseason and that always gets you excited.” \nSenior goalkeeper Paige Garloff also came up big for Emmaus with six saves to post the shutout. \n“Paige was superb in the goal cage,” Butz-Stavin said. \nEmmaus took a 1-0 lead just 1:25 into the game when Koehler scored off a corner with an assist from Dorn. \n“It’s always great to get on the board,” Butz-Stavin said. “Sometimes when you score early you drop back a little, but I like the way we kept our intensity up.” \nKoehler later added another goal on an assist from Sholder to make it 3-0 with 1:32 left in the first half. \n“I think a lot of my success is a reflection of the collaborative effort of the whole team,” Koehler said. “The defense works well to get the ball up to the midfield and on to the forward line.” \nButz-Stavin was disappointed that her team allowed Easton (14-5) eight corners. Emmaus had 12 corners and outshot the Red Rovers 17-6. \n“I’ll have to look at the tape to see why they got all those corners,” Butz-Stavin said. “We have to clean that up.” \nIn the first meeting between the teams on Sept. 4, Emmaus won 6-0 as Butz-Stavin tied the national record with her 839 th victory. Tuesday’s game was somewhat more competitive, but the Green Hornets left no doubt that they belong in Thursday’s title game. \n“We mirrored everything we tried to do in practice and it carried over to the field,” Koehler said. \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
