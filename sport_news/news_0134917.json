The Marshfield Rams beat the Dennis-Yarmouth Dolphins, went on to win the ACL and eventually a Division 2 state title. Marshfield has already beaten D-Y this season, and Falmouth’s only ACL opponent so far this season was Nauset, a winless team. The Clippers have yet to play the Dolphins and Sandwich Blue Knights, so the final ACL standings are far from settled. Marshfield and Falmouth are the only undefeated teams left in the conference. The showdown arrives at 7 tonight at Marshfield’s James G. Anderson Field. “I just don’t see Sandwich or Nauset being able to beat this team, so if Marshfield gets us tomorrow, I don’t think we have a very good chance of winning the league,” Falmouth coach Derek Almeida said. “We’re kind of treating it as if we want to win the league, we have to win tonight.” The Rams (4-0, 1-0 ACL), who are No. 1 in the state in the Boston Globe rankings, are coming off a 40-28 win against Bridgewater-Raynham in which they scored on offense, defense and special teams. Their first two touchdowns came via touchdown passes from senior quarterback Jack Masterson -- including a play-action pass to Jason Darcy that went for 69 yards and a touchdown 20 seconds into the game. Senior captain Danny Dalton returned an interception 95 yards for another touchdown. Dalton, a Penn State verbal commit who doubles as a tight end, may be Marshfield’s highest-profile player. He had two interceptions against Bridgewater-Raynham. The 6-foot-5, 230-pound linebacker had two sacks and a fumble recovery against D-Y in Week 3 as the Rams limited the Dolphins to just a touchdown and 177 total yards. Almeida got to watch the Rams play Bridgewater-Raynham, the rain postponing his own game to Saturday. He said that despite Dalton’s strength, rattling Masterson will be the key. “The quarterback is playing at such a high level,” Almeida said of Masterson. “You can really see when a high school quarterback is playing with confidence.” The Clippers (4-0, 1-0 ACL) blew out Nauset 41-14 in Week 4, punting just once before subbing in their backups early in the fourth quarter. Falmouth held Nauset to negative total yardage in the first half and 40 yards through three quarters, twice forcing turnovers and overwhelming the young Warriors. Quarterback Nick Couhig once again ran the offense with three touchdown runs and 156 passing and rushing yards. Michael LaFrange also looked strong, rushing for 71 yards and a touchdown on eight carries and returning the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown. Falmouth would’ve likely scored even more, but penalties wiped out several big runs and punt-returns, especially in the first quarter and early minutes of the second. The Clippers could afford a little sloppiness against Nauset, but Almeida knows even a few mistakes could cost them against the Rams. “We’ve focused on the mental side all week,” Almeida said. “I think we’re tough enough and we’re fast enough and strong enough to play with (Marshfield), but we have to do a better job on the mental side.” Falmouth last started a season 4-0 in 2010, then lost their next five games. It’ll take everything the Clippers have to keep their undefeated streak intact, but this Falmouth team clearly wants to prove they belong in that uppermost tier of high school teams.
