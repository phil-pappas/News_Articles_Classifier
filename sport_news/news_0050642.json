CZERWINSKI Staff Writers | Record File Photo St. Joseph Regional High School \nMONTVALE — An assistant freshman football coach at Saint Joseph Regional High School has been suspended indefinitely after fighting with a football player’s mother Tuesday afternoon during practice. \nBoth declined to press charges, police said. \nThe mother, Sharon Hardy, 40, of Elizabeth, came to the football field shortly before 4 p.m. and allegedly began arguing with a coach when another coach, Christopher Trout, 40, of New City, N.Y., tried to intervene, Capt. Joseph Sanfilippo said. Trout told them to quiet down because the argument had turned loud and vulgar. \nTrout told police that Hardy ran up to him and got in his face, screaming and spitting, Sanfilippo said. Trout said she slapped him across the face with keys in her hand and he pushed her away to protect himself, the captain said. \nBut Hardy told officers that Trout came up to her and spit at her, Sanfilippo said. She said she smacked Trout in the head with an open palm and he retaliated by punching her in the face, knocking her to the ground, he said. \n“We sent [Trout] off the field after the incident, and he hasn't been back with the team since,” St. Joseph athletic director Tony Karcich said after meeting with Trout on Thursday. “He's been suspended pending a further review of the case.” \nHardy and Trout would not press charges, and neither was arrested, Sanfilippo said. Hardy accepted an ice pack for her face but declined further medical attention. Trout was not injured. \nPolice are still interviewing witnesses but are not pursuing charges, Sanfilippo said. ©2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:25:54.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
