Now he is sending the warning out again. \nFrom people entering homes and stealing prescription drugs to others using or dealing meth, law enforcement officers in Spink County have a battle on their hands. \n\"I feel like we're just, we're losing traction to be honest with you. We arrest a known source and we arrest people that are using it and people just come in behind it and fill in where these people left off,\" Schurch said. \nIn the past two weeks, officers arrested multiple people for using or dealing meth. In some cases, kids were in homes with both parents arrested. \nUsually Spink County has about two people in jail. This week that number has been up to a dozen, most of them for meth. \nThat's costing Spink County tax payers somewhere around $1,000 a day. Officers need to drive them back and forth from Redfield where they appear in court to jails in surrounding counties where they're being held. \nAt one of the churches in town, Pastor Josh Kendrick runs a recovery group for people battling drug addiction. With the increase in arrests, he's happy to see something being done about the problem. \n\"But it is disheartening to know just how big of a problem it is but we believe that God's going to use this for great things, this group that we're doing,\" Kendrick said. \nSchurch says the public has been helpful, feeding tips that lead to arrests. Regardless of where you live, you can too. \n\"Spink County is not alone in this problem. Most every other county that I've talked to is experiencing a rise in methamphetamine arrests and home invasions looking for prescription drugs to steal,\" Schurch said. \nSchurch is ready to see a downward trend instead. \nThe county now has a drug dog to help in the fight and the sheriff says the dog helped a lot with the recent arrests.
