Looking to embrace the autumnal bounty? Head out to Pioneer Courthouse Square for a hard cider tasting at NW Ciderfest . Eager to get back into the sun? The Here & There Travel Fest will help you on your way.\nAnd if you truly want to fill your soul with the spirit of the Pacific Northwest, pull on a pair of Xtratufs and head out to the Fall Kite Festival on the coast, where both rain and high winds are expected to greet bold and talented kite fliers all weekend.\nThe sun will soon return, but the time has come for us to begin our seasonal acclimation to the drizzle and clouds. Soak it up, Portland, because the gray is here to stay.\n1. NW Ciderfest: More than 30 cideries will gather at Pioneer Courthouse Square for Portland's last big cider festival of the year. NW Ciderfest , which is also a fundraiser for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, is an all-ages event, with ID only needed to actually taste the hard cider.\nSaturday and Sunday @ Pioneer Courthouse Square; free to attend, $25 for six drink tokens and a glass\n2. Onion Festival: Sherwood's annual Great Onion Festival is back, and while the real draw should be the food vendors, sautéing onions for all kinds of delicious dishes, the onion eating contest will offer some mealtime entertainment, challenging locals to eat as many raw onions as they can stand.\nSaturday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. @ Archer Glen Elementary School; free\n3. Travel Fest: The Oregonian Media Group is hosting a regional, national and international travel show, the Here & There Travel Fest . See world music, hear talks from local travel writers and, of course, plan your next getaway – in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.\nSaturday and Sunday @ Oregon Convention Center; $6\n4. Tattoo Expo: Considered the largest tattoo show in the Pacific Northwest, the Portland Tattoo Expo returns to the Expo Center with a slate of tattoo artists from around the country, showing off their art and tattooing live all weekend.\nFriday through Sunday @ Portland Expo Center; $20 one-day pass, $40 for three days\n5. Fall Kite Festival: Real Oregonians know that fall is a fine time to visit the coast, made even finer this weekend with the Lincoln City Fall Kite Festival . Rain is in the forecast (which might derail the event), but so is strong wind – up to 19 mph. Throw on a parka and head to the beach to watch kite battles and acrobatic kite performances.\n Saturday and Sunday @ Lincoln City; free\n--Jamie Hale | jhale@oregonian.com | @HaleJamesB", "external_links": ["http://www.oregonianmediagroup.com/travel-show/", "http://www.oregoncoast.org/lincoln-city-fall-kite-festival/", "http://www.nwciderfest.org/", "http://www.portlandtattooexpo.com/", "http://www.twitter.com/halejamesb"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:54:08.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
