The top-seeded and undefeated York High School field hockey team quickly found itself down a goal in the opening 90 seconds of Tuesday’s Class B South quarterfinal game against Gray-New Gloucester. The defending Class B state champions regrouped, tied the game six minutes later and took the lead for good with just 14 minutes left in the first half, cruising from there to a 7-1 victory over the No. 8 seed. “I had a feeling it may be a tough start for us today for some reason,” said York head coach Barb Marois, who led the Wildcats to Class B state championships in 2008 and 2014. “Lesson learned, though. I told the girls even games you win there are a lot of things you can learn from.” The win extended York’s win streak to 33 games and the Wildcats have gone 50-1 since the start of the 2012 season; its only loss was to Nokomis in the 2012 Class B state championship game. York (15-0) will play host to No. 4 Kennebunk (10-4-1) on Saturday in a Class B semifinal game. The winner of Saturday’s game will advance to next Tuesday’s Class B South championship game at Fitzpatrick Stadium in Portland. Kennebunk advanced with an 8-0 win over No. 5 Lake Region on Tuesday. York beat Kennebunk both times the school played in the regular season, both by 2-1 scores. “They are going to challenge us for sure,” Marois said. “It was a close game the last time we played, one of the games we certainly had to battle through and fight through some circumstances. It will be another good challenge for us. It will be nice to play them here.” York junior Lily Posternak, who made a verbal commitment to play at Duke University earlier in the season, tied the game at 1-1 with 22:59 left in the half on a low, hard-hit shot that went screaming past the right leg of Gray-New Gloucester goalie Adrianna Kimball and into the corner of the goal. Although the Wildcats started to control play, the score remained tied until senior Alie Jones poked home a rebound in front of the net with 13:57 remaining in the the half. “The second goal hurt us,” Gray-New Gloucester coach Christa Roddy said. “At 1-1 you think we’re still in it and we still got it; then the second goal was scored and I think it just crushed us. The girls started watching York and admiring their skills instead of doing what we needed to do.” The Wildcats increased the lead to 4-1 by halftime thanks to goals by senior Devon Datsis and sophomore Sydney Bouchard. “Once we got that (second) goal, it certainly helped our girls settle into the game a little more,” Marois said. The offensive barrage continued in the second half as Posternak, Jones and Datsis all scored their second goals of the game in the final 30 minutes. “We don’t have enough girls on the field to cover all of them,” Roddy said. “We tried to plan for it and anticipate it. I think our girls did a nice job of not giving up on them, but (Posternak, Jones and Datsis) certainly are powerful players.” Posternak’s second goal of the game, assisted by both Datsis and Jones, increased York’s lead to 6-1 with 24 minutes left in the game. “They are dangerous,” Marois said of the trio. “It’s nice to have them in different spots so we can attack from different areas of the field.” Posternak said she was frustrated with how the game started. “They came out stronger than us and set the tone,” Posternak said. “That’s not how we want to play. It wasn’t a great start, but we worked our way out of it. I think that goal woke us up a little bit. We have a lot of scorers on this team; everybody can shoot and everybody can get in there for a tip.” Allie Martell scored the lone Gray-New Gloucester goal. Freshman goalie Julianna Kiklis started for York and gave way to sophomore Julia Carr with 15:45 left in the game. Neither Kiklis or Carr had to make a save thanks to the defensive play in front of from, paced by senior captain Catherine Marcoullier, senior Eleanor Cifrino and junior Ali Lawlor.
