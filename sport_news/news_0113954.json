The RSS too said it firmly supports the existing reservation policy as enshrined in the Constitution and “condemned distortion” of the remarks of its chief Mohan Bhagwat to create confusion about the organisation’s view on the issue. “The BJP does not favour any change in the reservation policy, rather it supports the existing quota policy. We are committed to keeping inviolable these constitutional rights given to the Dalits, tribals, backwards and others,” Shah said addressing his first press conference here since the state Assembly elections got underway. The BJP has been on the back foot over Bhagwat’s comments seeking a review of the quota policy despite the party and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi distancing from it. Despite that, there has been no let up in attacks from both Nitish and Lalu, who rally after election rally are voicing apprehension about scrapping of quotas, a highly sensitive issue in post-Mandal Bihar. Shah said both he and Modi have clarified that the existing reservation policy will stay and the BJP has no intention of fiddling with it. The BJP president said Bhagwat never spoke about doing away with quotas. Meanwhile, apparently apprehensive about caste polarisation in the state which could go against the BJP-led NDA, the RSS said, “Mohan Bhagwat’s views on the reservation policy has been presented (by critics) after distorting it...an attempt has been made to create confusion about the RSS’s stand on reservation policy.” “The RSS condemns such efforts to distort Bhagwat’s views to mislead the people and create confusion about its stand on reservation,” Kshethra Karyawah (Regional Head), north-east, Mohan Singh said in a statement. “The RSS firmly supports the reservation policy enshrined in the constitution,” he said, adding that the issue should not be politicised. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:04:10.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
