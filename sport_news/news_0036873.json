From Seattle Seahawks running back Thomas Rawls putting up 169 yards in Marshawn Lynch's stead to San Francisco 49ers linebacker Aaron Lynch pressuring Eli Manning on nearly every drop back, previously unknown players stepped up big time.\nAdChoices This week won't be any different. Whether it's due to injuries to starters or just a lack of production from veterans, here are 10 unheralded players set to step up and make major impacts in Week 6.\n1. Marcus Cannon, offensive tackle, New England Patriots\n© AP Photo/Stew Milne New England Patriots guard Marcus Cannon (61) runs off the field following an NFL game, Sunday, Sept. 27, 2015, in Foxborough, Mass. Whether his impact is going to be good or bad remains to be seen. Cannon, a mid-round pick back in 2011, is a great story. Overcoming cancer, the former Texas Christian standout has stuck on the Patriots for five years. He's now going to be given an extended opportunity to prove he's starter-worthy with Nate Solder lost for the season.\nCannon will either protect Tom Brady's blindside or slide in as the starting right tackle against the Indianapolis Colts this weekend. With 11 career starts under his belt and mixed success on the field, he's definitely a downgrade from Solder in the lineup. How big of a downgrade he is could very well determine the Patriots success moving forward this season. In 144 offensive snaps this year, Cannon has allowed one sack.\n2. Allen Hurns, wide receiver, Jacksonville Jaguars\n© Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images Allen Hurns #88 of the Jacksonville Jaguars makes a catch over Bradley McDougald #30 of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during a game at Raymond James Stadium on October 11, 2015 in Tampa, Florida. Blake Bortles may very well be on the verge of finding himself throwing to one of the top wide receiver tandems in the league. Allen Robinson, a more-heralded player than Hurns, has put up 402 yards and four touchdowns thus far this season.\nMeanwhile, Hurns actually leads the team in receptions (27) and yards (430) while scoring three touchdowns. In fact, this second-year player from Miami ranks in the top 10 in the NFL in receiving.\nNursing a hamstring injury, it will be interesting to see how much Hurns can provide against the Tennessee Titans in a battle for last place in the AFC South. If he's able to continue his stellar play, it will lead to another tremendous outing from the up-and-coming Bortles. It will also give the Jaguars' offense some identity moving forward this year.\n3. Brian Robison, defensive end, Minnesota Vikings\n© Jesse Johnson-USA TODAY Sports Minnesota Vikings defensive end Brian Robison (96) celebrates after making a sack on Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford (not pictured) in the second half at TCF Bank Stadium. The Vikings won 26-16. Robison is one of those players you hear about during a game multiple times, but never really think twice about. He's just out there doing his job — doing it quite well.\nA five-year starter for the Vikings, Robison is playing his best football this season. Equally as good against the run as he is rushing the passer, the former Texas standout has recorded a whopping 16 quarterback hurries in just four games. To put that into perspective, he's hurrying the quarterback about 15 percent of the time.\nGoing up against a Kansas City Chiefs offensive line that has allowed 21 sacks this season, Robison should have a field day on Sunday. The one positive here for Kansas City is that Eric Fisher has performed well in recent games — an indication that he may be able to hold down the fort against Robison.\n4. Brandon Williams, defensive tackle, Baltimore Ravens\n© AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar Baltimore Ravens nose tackle Brandon Williams (98) gets up close and personal with a video camera while celebrating a 23-20 overtime win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in an NFL football game in Pittsburgh, Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015. In just his third season out of Missouri Southern, Williams is already one of the most dominating interior defensive linemen in the NFL. As more of a run-stuffing nose tackle in Baltimore's 3-4 defense, he's the primary reason that unit is allowing just 3.8 yards per attempt to running backs.\nGoing up against one of the league's best young running backs in Carlos Hyde, it's going to be important for Baltimore to stop the run. If it's able to do that, the San Francisco 49ers will have to win with Colin Kaepernick through the air.\nThis is where Williams comes into play. He'll be lining up against an interior of the 49ers offensive line that has been a downright travesty this season. Though, a Pro Bowl caliber left guard in Alex Boone might be able to find a way to open up holes for Hyde. That's going to be an important aspect of this game.\n5. Jamison Crowder, wide receiver, Washington Redskins\n© Mandatory Credit: Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports Washington Redskins wide receiver Jamison Crowder (80) runs wit the ball against the Atlanta Falcons during the second half at the Georgia Dome. The Falcons defeated the Redskins 25-19 in overtime. Of the receivers that have hauled in 20-plus catches this season, Crowder boasts the highest reception percentage of the group. Through five weeks, this rookie from Duke has caught 23 of the 27 passes thrown in his direction.\nInterestingly, Crowder started seeing ample playing time when DeSean Jackson went down with a hamstring injury. The rookie has caught 21 of his 23 passes in the past three games. With Jackson apparently suffering a setback on Thursday, there's a decent chance Crowder will find himself playing an important role against the New York Jets on Sunday. If so, expect another solid performance from the rookie.\n6. Shaquil Barrett, linebacker, Denver Broncos\n© Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports Denver Broncos linebacker Shaquil Barrett (48) pass rushes in the first quarter against the Baltimore Ravens at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. With DeMarcus Ware out for the next two weeks due to a back injury, the Broncos have named Barrett the starter. A practice squad player after going undrafted out of Colorado State last year, Barrett earned a spot on the 53-man roster with a strong preseason performance this year. More than that, he earned an important role in Denver's pass-rush rotation — a group that also includes first-round picks Von Miller and Shane Ray.\nThis season alone, Barrett has recorded two sacks and four quarterback hurries in limited playing time (less than 20 snaps per game). With him slated to take on a darn good Cleveland Browns offensive line, it's going to be important for the youngster to provide a solid pass rush opposite Miller. If that happens, the Broncos stand a good chance of remaining undefeated.\n7. Ross Cockrell, cornerback, Pittsburgh Steelers\n© Mandatory Credit: Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports San Diego Chargers wide receiver Malcom Floyd (80) is tackled by Pittsburgh Steelers defensive back Ross Cockrell (31) during the third quarter after making a catch at Qualcomm Stadium. Probably Pittsburgh's best defensive back through five weeks, Cockrell's early-season performance has been somewhat stunning. A fourth-round pick of the Buffalo Bills in 2014, this Duke product was actually released after seeing limited playing time as a rookie. Catching on with Pittsburgh, he's now gone up against the opposing team's No. 1 receiver — first Steve Smith in Week 4, and then Keenan Allen on Monday night — in the past two games.\nCockrell will face an equally difficult task of lining up against Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald on Sunday. The 32-year-old receiver is having one heck of a comeback campaign after failing to put up 1,000 yards in each of the past three seasons. Through five games, Fitzgerald ranks in the top-10 of the NFL in receptions (35), receiving yards (490) and leads the league with six touchdown catches.\nFor his part, Cockrell, held Smith an Allen to a combined 10 receptions for 78 yards. Though, Smith did leave the game against Pittsburgh with a back injury. It will definitely be interesting to see if this second-year corner can find a way to slow Fitzgerald down. If that happens, Pittsburgh could be looking at a 4-2 record following Sunday's action.\n8. Mario Addison, defensive end, Carolina Panthers\n© AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston (3) is helped by tackle Gosder Cherilus (78) after breaking away from Carolina Panthers defensive end Mario Addison (97) during the first half of an NFL football game in Tampa, Fla., Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015. We included Addison in this article heading into Week 4. He responded by tallying seven quarterback hurries against Jameis Winston and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That was one of the primary reasons Carolina was able to pick off the rookie quarterback four times in a blowout win.\nThis week against the worst offensive line in the NFL, Addison should find himself in Russell Wilson's face all game. The Seattle Seahawks quarterback is being pressured on 46 percent of his drop backs and is on pace to be sacked more than any other player in the history of the NFL.\nIt's going to be imperative that Carolina takes advantage of Seattle's biggest weakness. Equally as important, Addison will need to hold contain when protection breaks down in front of Wilson. If these two things happen, Carolina may very well remain undefeated.\n9. Charcandrick West, running back, Kansas City Chiefs\n© Peter G. Aiken/Getty Images It's pretty clear that Andy Reid and company are planning on West taking over the primary ball-carrier duties for Jamaal Charles, who was lost for the season after suffering a torn ACL last week. Without much regular season sample size, West is a true wild card here. Reid is said to be fond of his receiving ability — something that will come in handy with Mr. check down himself, Alex Smith, under center.\nWith only preseason action to go on here, West did perform extremely well over the summer. He averaged 4.9 yards per rush on 28 attempts while catching all six of the passes thrown in his direction. While the preseason matters little when it comes to stats, it's important to note that West was going up against first-team defenses a majority of the time with Charles playing a total of 23 snaps in four games.\nNow taking on a Vikings defense that has had its struggles against the run, West could very well have a big game. And in reality, he will need to in order for the Chiefs to avoid a fifth consecutive loss.\n10. EJ Manuel, quarterback, Buffalo Bills\n© Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports Buffalo Bills quarterback EJ Manuel (3) throws the football during a game against the Miami Dolphins at Sun Life Stadium. While everything seems to be pointing to Tyrod Taylor playing on Sunday, Bills head coach Rex Ryan remains cautious heading into an important game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\nThe way Buffalo has been conservative with injuries this year, it wouldn't be surprising to see Taylor sit after he suffered a sprained MCL last week. If so, Manuel will get the start against a stout Bengals defense.\nPretty much a lost cause after a 2014 campaign that saw him benched in favor of Kyle Orton, this former first-round pick impressed enough in camp and during the preseason to beat out Matt Cassel as Taylor's primary backup.\nPreseason stats may amount to a hill of beans, but Manuel did perform at a high level when called on during the summer. He completed 67 percent of his passes with four touchdowns and zero picks.\nIn order for Buffalo to move to 4-2 on the season, it will need solid quarterback play against Cincinnati. If Manuel is indeed the guy under center, it will be up to him to provide that.\nCheck out Vincent's other work on eDraft.com and follow him on Twitter @VincentFrankNFL .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/VincentFrankNFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "https://twitter.com/mikerodak/status/654713632064835584", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:13:27.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
