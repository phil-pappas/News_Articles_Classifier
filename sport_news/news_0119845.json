Who do we play on sun??\" \nBut asked if he was worried about the part played by the Aussie commissioner, Dark Blues coach Hines - a former Scotland international who was himself born Down Under - said: \"It's not my concern, it's World Rugby's. He's the citing commissioner. He saw something, put his report in, and now we wait and see what happens. \n\"He is neutral, isn't he? He's a professional. They are there to do a job. He thinks he has seen something. \n\"World Rugby have put him there because they are happy with his neutrality. That's for them to sort out and not us.\" \nBut Scotland wing Tommy Seymour admits it would be a blow if the pair were ruled out for their two-man tip tackle on Jack Lam, which saw the Samoan flanker land on his head. \n\"I hope we get the outcome that Fordy and Jonny want,\" said the Glasgow flyer. \"To have them banned is not something that we want. They are both valuable members of this 31-man squad. \n\"We don't want to lose any players to anything, so obviously we will hope for the best. \n\"If it does happen, we have ample guys to step up.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:06:08.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
