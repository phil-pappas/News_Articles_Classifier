Detectives later found Gardner's body near Belfair with gunshot wounds.\nProsecutors in the case had argued that Grisso killed Gardner because he wanted to begin a relationship with another woman.\nGrisso's attorney maintained that there was no evidence connecting his client to the crime.\nThe jury deliberated for less than a day before finding Grisso guilty. His sentencing has been set for November.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1LajV4j"], "published": "2015-10-09T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:07:31.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
