(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Sponsored Links The Associated Press BATON ROUGE, La. â€” \nLeonard Fournette highlighted his third straight 200-yard game with a 75-yard touchdown run, and No. 9 LSU overcame a fitful performance to beat Eastern Michigan 44-22 on Saturday night. \nFournette had 233 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries to remain among the top contenders for the Heisman Trophy. He also became the first player in the history of the Southeastern Conference to rush for 200-plus yards in three straight games. \nBut some might have expected even more from the 6-foot-1, 230-pound sophomore against the Eagles (1-4), who came in allowing a nation's-worst 373.2 yards rushing per game. \nThe Eagles stacked their defense to stop the run, but the Tigers (4-0) struggled to cash in through the air. LSU quarterback Brandon Harris was 4 of 15 for 80 yards with one interception. \n__ \nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WFTV Morning News Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:32:42.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
