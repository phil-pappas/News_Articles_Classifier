Middle blocker Abby E'Nama slammed eight kills, Taylor Collier picked up seven and Alison Palmer and Izzie Marsico each had six kills. \n\"I was thrilled with our first set performance,\" said head coach Tyler Coupe. \"I think it was the best we've played all season. We knew St. Thomas More was going to be a strong team from the get go. They pushed us and we responded.\" \nCoupe was quick to praise his players for the way they responded to playing a very tough Ravens squad. \n\"Kira Vitella, by far, had the best game of her season,\" he said. \"She kept us in every single point. Whenever we were down, I knew she would get a great up for us. She had an amazing night.\" \n\"We really came out and played together and strong,\" said Vitella, giving kudos to her teammates. \nOffensively, Abby E'Nama and Taylor Collier led the way for the Lady Vikings. \n\"As a team, we were plagued by errors,\" Coupe said. \"But Abby and Taylor keep their heads level and pushed us through.\" \n\"I finally got my approach down,\" said Collier. \" I started to get my swing and just had my focus and was getting all my serves in. I thought it was important to get the team together to bring us up because this is always a tough game for us, and we just need to be together when we're playing.\" \nCape has never won more than 11 games in a season. They are 10-1 under first-year coach Coupe with four matches left to play. \nThe Lady Vikings junior varsity defeated the Ravens JV 2-1 to move their record to 7-4 on the season. \nThe Vikings travel to Delmar Tuesday, Oct. 20 for a match up with the 6-4 Wildcats.
