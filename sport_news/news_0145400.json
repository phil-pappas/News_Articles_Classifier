But we just feel like he's in that spot.\"\nWhich is not to say the wunderkind, Larkin, would not have made it, regardless.\nMike Babcock traveled to both Europe and Grand Rapids late last season, saying he was watching young Larkin.\nGeneral Manager Ken Holland clearly was impressed by Larkin, too. But Holland's determination, ability and demonstrated success in marshaling the organization to prepare young talent to the point it is beyond NHL-ready when it arrives on the Wings' bench seemed likely to prevail.\nIt is a pattern and practice -- in fact, quite nearly a tradition -- that is clearly frustrating some fans.\nThe fact of the matter is, however, that a major reason for the continuing success of the Red Wings while rebuilding is Holland's determination that prospects should not fail, when they first arrive.\nBut what is plain from Larkin making the roster is that two people pushed hardest to get it done -- Larkin and Blashill.\nThe new coach clearly controls his own roster, by and large. When he presses hard for what he wants, he gets it.\nDespite lots of consideration that Larkin was destined for the minors, Blashill was not going to have it that way, especially with Larkin proving the point in just over a month in Detroit and Traverse City.\nBlashill is willing to take a risk, buck what is acknowledged as policy and even defy Red Wings tradition, if he believes it helps the club win. When you are working your tail off, especially at an advancing age with a roster still rebuilding after some glorious seasons, you tend to like a guy who leads.\nJeff Blashill on Dylan Larkin: “If a guy made our team better and is going to play minutes, then he was going to make our team.\"   (Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nThere is no doubt that Larkin sealed the deal, and made the move easier.\nWhen he talked about wanting to be \"the best player in the world\" since he was a young boy, any knowledgeable listener did not think it was too brash, let alone outrageous bravado. Larkin is that skilled, that self-assured and, right now, he is having considerable impact, almost shift-by-shift.\nWhen he talked about how he believed he left little doubt he should remain with the club at the start of the season, one might note that no prospect has made a similar assertion, in the face of Red Wings policy, practice and even tradition, in some time.\nBut the bold assertion rang true.\nThat Blashill discerned the circumstances and made sure his decision became THE decision is a mark of a good coach. It is critical, several days before the start of his first season, in the shadow of a master, that Blashill had the confidence and self-possession to see it through.\nIt is a new day for the Red Wings in a variety of ways.\nIn Mike Green and Brad Richards, two significant free agents finally arrived this summer. With Larkin, a young player is instilling the belief the franchise is on the rise, once again, and maybe in ways that can be significant, sooner than anticipated.\nAnd the new coach? Blashill seems eminently in control and it already shows. Dylan Larkin is on the roster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:16:01.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
