It’s amazing,’’ Lewis says. In the trees off the fairway, in the rough, heck, in the middle of a pond. Rex has a hole in every pants pocket. \nFrom the outside, the Buffalo Bills coach seems like a guy you’d want to take a cross-country trip with, in a big ol’ truck, bed filled with cases of adult sodas. You’d stop at every all-you-can eat joint, bend a few elbows, insult each other, maybe discuss women’s feet, and waddle out the door. \n“We handle some situations a little differently,’’ Lewis says. \nNot all, though. Ryan is in the bunker between July and January, same as his friend. It’s a unique cave that suffers no intrusion. In it, there is no room for savoring. There is only the Next Game. It seems such a joyless enterprise, like a greyhound chasing the mechanical rabbit. Woe be the team that enjoys one win while preparing for the next one. \nWhen someone asks Lewis about his team staying on task, Lewis refers to the weekly process of game planning: “Discussion, installation, revision, execution.’’ Man, that sounds like a blast. “We have to outwork them each and every down.’’ \nOf Ryan, Lewis offers, “He does a great job getting guys to play hard for him.’’ On Sunday, Ryan will be trying to derail the Bengals express. Bengals-Bills: What you need to know \nCincinnati is 5-0, but not full of itself. The Dalton Gang rides high, but its members know they work in a city of skeptics. They have not been January men since 1991, so every game between now and New Year’s is prolog. Ten minutes after one of the best wins in franchise history last Sunday against Seattle – after the collective, Marvin Lewis-led Who-Deys and a few back slaps and handshakes – the game faces reappeared like masks at Mardi Gras. \n“Everybody knows we haven’t done anything yet,’’ guard Clint Boling says. \nPut another way, courtesy of Wallace Gilberry: “Talk is cheap. If somebody keeps telling you you’re good, you start believing that. We feel like we’re a good team. A great team, actually. But we’d rather go out here and show you. This didn’t happen for us overnight. Individually and collectively, we’ve been working.’’ \nThen Gilberry goes Jedi Master: “Our main focus now,’’ he says, “is to keep The Force.’’ \nBengals-Bills on Sunday, on what is forecast to be a cold, sloppy day, is what is known in the business as a Trap Game. High-flyers walk into the all-you-can-eat café, fresh from conquering a six-pound sirloin in an hour the night before, assuming another free meal. The Bengals are attracting national notice, they’re on the road against an average team that’s a little beat up on offense, they’re feeling good about themselves. \nNever forget, this is Bernie Sanders’ league, forever striving to have 32 teams finish 8-8. “Who’s to say we don’t get beat by 30?’’ Gilberry asks. \n(Plus, there is the Seattle Factor. Since 2013, teams that have played the Seahawks are a combined 10-21-1 in their next game. Seattle’s defense beats on people.) \nBengals players dismiss this. It’s in their dismissal that you find the good in losing four consecutive first-round playoff games, and being 0-for-25-years in the postseason. The players share the cave with their coach. “We know the perception,’’ says Gilberry. \nDo you trust success, George Iloka? \n“No,’’ says the Bengals safety. “I trust preparation. You don’t want to lose a game on the practice field. \n“The five-and-oh thing is great. The true test is later in the season. People talk about statement games. We’ve won a lot of statement games. Last year, the Broncos. That’s nothing new. The real test will come late in the year.’’ \nLike most coaches, Lewis uses the heathen media to reinforce messages already delivered to his players. That’s why every post-game presser this season hasn’t been a glad celebration of what just occurred, but a sober reminder of what is to come. His players “understand the mental strength it takes to play on the road,’’ Lewis says. “Good (win), boom, let’s go onto the next one. You don’t sit there and talk about it.’’ \nRyan’s team is good on defense, especially against the run. He’s missing his starting quarterback and likely his best running back, LeSean McCoy. But Ryan has the Bills believing. He finds ways. He’d love to beat his good friend, then remind him about it on some golf course next June, as he’s dropping a fresh Titleist through the hole in his pants pocket. \nGames can be lost between the ears. Bengals-Bills might offer a fine example. 80 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1ROQw4m TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:29:44.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
