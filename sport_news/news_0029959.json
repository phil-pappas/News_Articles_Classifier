The wounded female officer managed to shoot and kill the female Palestinian assailant.\nTwo separate attempted stabbing attacks in Jerusalem and Hebron were foiled Saturday morning after the would-be assailants were shot at the scenes of each incident.\nThe first attempted attack was foiled near Hebron's Jewish settlement enclave Beit Hadassah Saturday morning after an armed civilian shot and killed a Palestinian who attempted to stab him.\nAccording to Palestinian sources, the assailant was Fadel Mohammed al-Qawasameh, an 18-year-old resident of Hebron. Palestinian officials expressed doubt over Qawasameh's intentions to carry out an attack. Further, a Hebron resident said that Qawasameh was not immediately killed, and that soldiers prevented Red Crescent emergency responders from providing medical treatment. However, there are photos documenting Israeli soldiers providing Qawasameh with medical treatment and attempting CPR.\nSince the beginning of this week three Israeli were killed and 39 were wounded in 16 terror attacks. Ten of this week's attacks were in Jerusalem â€“ in the most serious attack, two Palestinians from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukkaber stormed a bus in Armon Hanatziv armed with a gun and a knife, killing one and wounding 20 others. Shortly after, a Palestinian slammed his car into a bus station in Malkhei Yisrael Street in Jerusalem, killing one Israeli and wounding three others.\nThe terror wave started about two weeks ago, when Palestinians shot dead Naama and Eitam Henkin who were driving with their four children near the settlement of Elon Moreh in the West Bank. So far, seven Israelis were killed in terror attacks, and 13 terrorists were shot dead. Seven Palestinians, including five teens, were killed by Israeli troops' fire in clashes in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. Twelve more were killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli troops' fire and airstrikes.\nGili Cohen\nHaaretz Correspondent\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/GiliCohen89?fref=ts", "https://twitter.com/gilicohen10", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:42:47.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
