(AP Photo/Jonathan Bachman) \nNEW ORLEANS (AP) — The Dallas Cowboys are having a hard time without their injured stars, even when backup quarterback Brandon Weeden comes through in the clutch. \nWeeden led a 91-yard touchdown drive to tie it late in the fourth quarter, but it still was not enough as the Cowboys (2-2) lost their second in a row after losing quarterback Tony Romo to a broken collarbone in Week 2 and All-Pro receiver Dez Bryant to a broken right foot in Week 1. \nDrew Brees connected with running back C.J. Spiller for an 80-yard touchdown on the second play of overtime and the Saints (1-3) won 26-20 on Sunday night at the Superdome. \nUnlike last week, when the Cowboys were outscored 25-0 after taking a 28-14 lead on Atlanta, this one was close all the way. The outcome was the same, though. \n“When you lose your two franchise players like Tony and Dez, it’s tough, but that’s what happens in this league,” said tight end Jason Witten, who had four catches for 57 yards. “You have to regroup. This team doesn’t make excuses, and we’ll get back at it.” \nWeeden, who lost his 10th consecutive start, did his best to end the streak near the end of regulation. He completed big passes to Terrance Williams, Witten and Cole Beasley before Williams made a diving 17-yard catch in the back of the end zone on fourth down as Dallas tied it at 20 with 1:51 left. \n“It’s kind of bittersweet,” Weeden said. “The execution was how you draw it up, but the end result didn’t go in our favor. We didn’t get the ball back.” \nGiven a reprieve when the Saints’ Zach Hocker banged a 30-yard field goal off the left upright with 12 seconds left, the Cowboys’ short-handed defense could not take advantage. \nThe Saints won the overtime coin toss. Seconds later, Spiller beat backup linebacker Damien Wilson on a wheel route and safety Barry Church missed a diving tackle as Spiller raced down the sideline for the winning score. \n“We were in man-to-man coverage, and Brees saw that from the jump and saw we had a linebacker on Spiller,” Church said. “He laid the ball up there perfectly for him. I tried to get over the top to help him out but he was down the sideline. I feel like I should have gotten him, but I missed him.” \nWilson was in for starter Sean Lee, who left in the first half with a concussion. The Cowboys also played their fourth consecutive game without suspended defensive end Greg Hardy (suspension) and third game in a row without rookie pass rusher Randy Gregory (ankle), a second-round draft pick. \n“Right when the play call came out of (coach) Sean Payton’s mouth for C.J., I thought, ‘This is it. This is going the distance,” Brees said. \nJoseph Randle had a 1-yard TD run for Dallas, which failed to win what would have been an 11th-straight regular season road game. But even with New Orleans struggling, winning in the Superdome was going to be a tall order for a Cowboys squad riddled with injuries. \nIf all the players who were inactive and Lee’s first-half concussion weren’t enough, Lance Dunbar, who’d rushed for 54 yards in the first half, had to be helped off the field with a knee injury after returning the kickoff to open the second half. \nBy contrast, the Saints benefited not only from having Brees back, but also cornerback Keenan Lewis (hip), safety Jairus Byrd (knee) and linebacker Dannell Ellerbe (toe) in the lineup for the first time this season. \nWeeden went 16 of 26 for 246 yards with no interceptions and produced 10 points on Dallas’ first two possessions, but the Cowboys stalled from there, managing only a 38-yard field goal from Dan Bailey on their next six series. \nA career high-tying run of 45 yards by Dunbar set up a 30-yard field goal on their opening possession, and the Cowboys took advantage of four defensive penalties to get a touchdown the next time they had the ball. \nNOTES: Weeden is tied with Blaine Gabbert for the longest losing streak as a starter for an active quarterback. . Before his missed field goal, Hocker not only made a pair of field goal attempts, but also hit a clutch 43-yard punt to the Dallas 9 in the fourth quarter while filling in for regular punter Thomas Morstead, who was icing an apparent quad injury. … Dallas coach Jason Garrett said Dunbar’s knee injury appeared serious. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:27:18.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
