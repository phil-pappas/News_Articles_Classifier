He’s works in a different realm, definitely, than we usually do.\n“It was clear to see that it looks like it’s easy, but it definitely isn’t. It’s clear he’s put some time in, and he’s competitive, too.”\nProkhorov dribbling against the wall, part one \nA video posted by Tim Bontemps (@timbontemps) on Sep 30, 2015 at 9:33am PDT \nProkhorov made it clear he wasn’t trying to show anyone up, just to show them some things he hoped could help them in the future.\n“All of [the players] are great partners,” Prokhorov said. “It’s only the first try. Imagine how I would look playing basketball? I would be clumsy. They are great athletes.”\nThe players aren't quite as good: \nA video posted by Tim Bontemps (@timbontemps) on Sep 30, 2015 at 9:19am PDT \nIt also was a rare chance for the players and coaches to spend one-on-one time with the owner, who pops in and out of town for games, often without seeing any of them.\n“It’s always nice to be around him,” Lionel Hollins said. “It’s my second time in person talking to him. It’s nice to get to know him, for him to get to know me.\n“He’s a very interesting guy. He should probably doing that [Dos Equis] commercial, ‘I don’t normally drink beer, but when I do… .’ He’s one of those guys that’s been around the world, has a varied sort of interest, and it’s interesting to get to know him better.”\n  brooklyn nets ,  jarrett jack ,  lionel hollins ,  mikhail prokhorov", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:26:08.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
