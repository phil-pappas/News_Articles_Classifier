Both USD Head Coach Joe Glenn and NDSU Head Coach Chris Klieman agreed afterwards that the best team that day won. \n\"We didn't get lucky,\" Glenn exclaimed. \"This wasn't a lucky win for us. they didn't fumble the ball to us, they didn't throw interceptions, they didn't get help from the officials. our numbers are the same,\" he added. \n\"You can get beat by anybody in this league if you're not ready to play. We proved whether or not we were ready to play, we just weren't a focused team. That wasn't the same focus I had seen the previous couple of weeks,\" Klieman said. \nThe win was the first for the Coyotes in Fargo since 1978, long before any of Glenn's players were born. But it is Glenn that has preached since his arrival in 2011 that his team has had the talent to pull off an upset of this magnitude, but needed to blow out a few candles in order to learn how. Now that they have senior Linebacker Keyen Lage hopes future Coyotes are paying attention. \n\"Coach Glenn always says we need to get more birthdays and we are now being led by a lot of juniors and seniors on this team. That is huge and now that we are able to accomplish that, we can come into the valley and beat anybody. Hopefully all of the recruits watching this game can see that this program is on the rise and we can keep winning games for those guys,\" Lage said. \nThe Coyotes trailed 21-14 at the half and as their defense pitched a shutout in the second half, the offense rallied behind junior QB Ryan Saeger to score the final 10 points of the game. \n\"They just got outplayed by a tough gritty bunch that was bound and determined to win this game. They fought and scrapped to the final kick and came out the winners. I couldn't be more proud of a group of guys. They could've folded this season real easy,\" Glenn said. \nThe Coyotes will look to make it two straight wins as they host a struggling Missouri State team this Saturday. Kickoff is set for 2 o'clock inside the Dakota Dome. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
