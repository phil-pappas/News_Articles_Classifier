Jordan Clarkson filled the lane to one side and Jabari Brown sprinted along the other edge.\nIn the middle of the chaos operated the rookie, D’Angelo Russell.\nThey closed in on the goal, but there would be no layup or corner 3-pointer. The target hid behind a short concrete barrier. Clarkson and Brown approached Lakers video coordinator J.J. Outlaw from the sides, and Russell stunned Outlaw by leaping over the barrier. Orange starbursts spattered on Outlaw’s clothing.\n“Stop shooting! Stop shooting!” Clarkson said Outlaw yelled, laughing at the memory.\nThe Lakers spent that day, about a week before training camp, on a paintball course near Long Beach. The field trip helps explain the early chemistry of this Lakers team.\n“These guys get along extremely well,” Coach Byron Scott said. “They like each other, they push each other, and it doesn’t happen that often when you have this many new people, this early.”\nEleven of the 19 players the Lakers brought to training camp were not on the team last season. The player who is getting much of the credit for the fast-assembled group’s immediate cohesion might come as a bit of a surprise.\nHe’s a newcomer, too.\nRoy Hibbert has quietly, quickly become a locker room leader. He shares stories of his own struggles when teammates are frustrated. He takes rookies to lunch. When the Lakers all received a group text inviting them to spend a day firing capsules of paint at each other, it came from Hibbert.\n“It’s a small thing,” Clarkson said, “but at the end of the day, it made us closer.”\n• • •\nThe Indiana Pacers jettisoned Hibbert across the country after his seventh, and least productive, season with the franchise. Hibbert was in Los Angeles when his agent, David Falk, called to tell him the news. Coincidentally, he and his wife had moved to L.A. for the summer.\nDrafted and dumped by the same team. In the years between, he was a Defensive Player of the Year candidate and an All-Star. Twice.\nBut the Pacers had plans for a faster, slicker style of play, and Hibbert’s lumbering, half-court ways didn’t fit.\nThe Lakers, who were worse defensively than all but one team last season, saw an opportunity to shore up their glaring hole in the middle.\n“We knew that we were getting a guy who was a hell of a defender,” Scott said, “a very good shot-blocker.”\nThrough six preseason games, he’s been that for the Lakers, who will have an opportunity to re-sign Hibbert in the summer and make him a piece of their future.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:27:09.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
