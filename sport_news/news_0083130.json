So it was a natural turnabout that the Coyote offense would move the ball, albeit without scoring a ton of points, and the defense would be on its heels all afternoon. \nThe end result was an 0-2 hole in the conference with a trip to North Dakota State next week. A real, real tough spot, in other words. \n“We have to rise above it and move on,” said USD linebacker John Wessel, who had 10 tackles. “We need to watch the film, learn what we need to fix and move on.” \nThe matter-of-fact approach is probably best at this point but it doesn’t change the fact that, for the third year in a row against the Leathernecks, the Coyotes and their coach were thoroughly disappointed in how they conducted themselves. \n“They were just better than we were today,” USD coach Joe Glenn said. “I think we were prepared to play but we didn’t play as well as we’d hoped and or as well as we can. So back to the drawing board.” \nThe picture being drawn on Saturday included a lot of Nikko Watson, a 250-pound running back who came in averaging 165 yards a game. He rambled through the Coyote defense for 107 first-half yards and finished with 139. \nThe Coyotes had a 20:12-9:48 advantage in time of possession in the first half and rolled up 209 yards of offense but they could not force a Leatherneck punt and left the first half trailing 19-7. This despite getting 68 rushing yards from true freshman running back Michael Fredrick and a 9-of-14 completion effort from Ryan Saeger. \nThe contest took a sobering turn late in the first half when USD guard Sam McLeran left the field in an ambulance after taking a hit and suffering from numbness in his right side. He left in a helicopter to be checked out in Iowa City. Initial reports from USD officials were positive; he was regaining feeling in his extremities on Saturday night. \n“He had no feeling or movement on the right side of his body,” Glenn said. “By the time they were loading him on the helicopter, he was getting feeling back. Our medical people say that’s great news. We’ll pray on that.” \nRegarding more trivial matters on the field, the Coyotes were not able to take advantage of positive events and it figured prominently in the outcome. \nThe first example: \nAfter tying the score at 7-7 with a 3-yard Trevor Bouma run, the Coyotes chased that with a successful onside kick and the opportunity to take the lead. The ensuing three-and-out was followed by a sub-par punt. Just seconds after a potentially pivotal execution of a gutsy play, the Leathernecks had the ball back at their own 30. \n“That’s on us as an offense,” said Saeger, who completed 17-of-29 passes for 197 yards. “We have to take advantage of those opportunities that we get. Those drives in those situations have a pivotal role in the game…we just have to stay on the field in those situations.” \nMore prominently, the Coyotes opened the second half with a two-play scoring drive and their unquestioned brightest moment when freshman Shamar Jackson went into the end zone on a 10-yard touchdown run. It narrowed USD’s deficit to 19-14 with almost an entire half to play. \nAt the time it seemed like a good thing. Two plays later Trenton Norvell found Joey Borsellino on a 61-yard touchdown pass. The score was 26-14 and the Coyotes were never the same. \n“We come out the second half and (offensive coordinator) Wesley Beschorner hits two calls in a row and we come back and let them throw one over our heads. Go figure.” \nThe figuring will definitely continue as the team looks for its first Missouri Valley win of the season. \n“I don’t think it was anything they did, we just didn’t play up to our ability,” said safety Jacob Warner, who had eight solo tackles. “We didn’t compete like we could have or like we should have and this is what happens in the Valley when you don’t come out ready to go.” \nSouth Dakota 7 0 7 7 — 21 \nW.
