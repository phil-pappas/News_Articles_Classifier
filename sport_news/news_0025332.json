Nicholas Upton (CC By-SA 2.0) Like anyone looking for concert tickets, weirdly specific sexual encounters, or somewhere to live, Adja Gildersleve turned to Craigslist when searching for a new apartment. The twenty-something scoured the posts for places suiting her modest needs — not crazy expensive, close to transit.\nShe found several she liked. But when she emailed and called, Gildersleve, who is black, often had trouble getting responses. Curious if prejudice was at play, she abandoned her first name, instead signing her name as “AJ.” Soon her phone was buzzing off the table.\n“I’m getting calls left and right under AJ,” she says.\nStill, sometimes when Gildersleve arrives at showings, landlords seem uncomfortable when they realize she’s black, she says. At least until she starts talking about herself — how she’s college educated and active in her community.\n“It’s hard. It’s really challenging being a black person looking for housing,” she says.\nunsanitary conditions in its buildings — could not immediately be reached for comment.\nGildersleve went into the office to plead her case with the agent, explaining the charges and pointing out her squeaky clean rental history. But rules are rules, she says she was told.\n“This is ridiculous. It’s like another form of redlining,” she says. “I technically am innocent now because I haven’t been proven guilty yet, but I’m still denied housing.”\nGildersleve isn’t throwing herself a pity party. She knew protesting might come with a price. Rather, the situation is emblematic of “a messed up system” that erects barriers preventing certain people from finding housing, a basic human need, she says.\n“It’s a risk and so I’m dealing with the consequences now,” Gildersleve acknowledges. “I’m not angry at the decisions I’ve made. … What I’m feeling heavy about is the system and how unjust they are and the consequences for folks having a voice. There’s consequences for having a voice and speaking out against oppressive systems.”\nAnd if anyone has a line on a decent one-bedroom, she’s still in the market.\nContact: Michael Rietmulder Follow: @mrietmulder ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/citypages", "https://twitter.com/mrietmulder", "http://www.fox9.com/news/30765088-story", "https://www.facebook.com/citypages"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:49:53.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
