The department said in a letter this month to Moline Historic Preservation commissioner Barb Sandberg that it wouldn't pay to move the depot because of budget cuts and added costs tied to the Interstate 74 bridge and corridor project. The depot must make way for new on- and off-ramps. Sandberg tells The (Moline) Dispatch (http://bit.ly/1M8FCRL ) that officials aren't giving up on saving it. She says conversations with someone interested in the building are ongoing. Western Illinois University said last year it couldn't take the building as originally planned, with renovation costs much higher than anticipated. Preservation officials learned in July that the state no longer planned to pay for moving the depot. ___ Information from: The Dispatch, http://www.qconline.com Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:17:14.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
