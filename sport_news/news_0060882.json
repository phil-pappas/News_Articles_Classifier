It is a shame for the team to have lost one of the cars and to not have a race.\" \nFor Hamilton, the 30-year-old is now firmly fixed to become the first British driver to successfully defend his grand prix crown. \nHe surpassed his idol Ayrton Senna with his 42nd career victory here on Sunday and is poised to join the great Brazilian as a triple world champion, too. \nA win at the Circuit of Americas in a fortnight's time - a race he won last year and in 2012 - with Vettel finishing third or lower will be the clincher. \nHe added: \"For me, those last five laps I was just really taking it in. I don't know how many times I will be in that position again, so I was just cherishing the moment and feeling really blessed. I love this car and I am truly grateful.\" \nTo cap a remarkable day for Hamilton, his Mercedes team also sealed back-to-back team titles after Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was demoted from fifth to eighth by the stewards after a last-lap collision with Valtteri Bottas. \nHamilton concluded: \"I did feel that the guys were going to do a good job, I just did not know it was going to be this good. They have done a better job this year than they did last year. \n\"There are always opportunities to make silly mistakes so I was proud of how I drove here. I feel like I have solidified my spot in the team in terms of delivering what they had expected and hoped. I am going to try and continue that.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:01:47.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
