The deals mean the tracks will host their events through the 2020 seasons, although the actual race dates can change. \nNASCAR made very few changes to the 2016 schedules announced Monday, with Pocono Raceway being one of the only differences. \nThe track in Long Pond will host its first Xfinity Series event June 4. The race will be held the day before Pocono’s first Sprint Cup Series race of the season. \nPocono will also host a Sprint Cup race July 31. \nOther differences in NASCAR’s 2016 schedule: \n— The spring race at Richmond will be moved from its traditional Saturday night date to Sunday, April 24. \n— Dover’s first race of the year was moved up before the Charlotte Motor Speedway races in May. \n— Michigan’s second race will be later in August than usual.
