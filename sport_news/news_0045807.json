It's really an individual sport but it's not just physical. It's also mental and emotional because you have to keep yourself going.\" \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \n\"You have to find your own strength to use and really building up your own confidence and realizing who you are -- not just in the game, but in life, too.\" \nMaya has realized who she is whether she's holding a racquet or a pen. She's the top singles player for the Saints on the court, and in the classroom, she has a weighted GPA of over 100. \n\"Tennis is a big thinking game and Maya is very strategic in tennis,\" said Seton tennis coach Katie Loughlin. \"She likes to move her opponents around the court and takes advantage of getting them out of position. She really thinks, not only for the shot she's making, but for the upcoming shot. She tries to set the points up, which she does very, very well.\" \nWhen she's not hitting a tennis ball or the books, Maya is helping one of her seven siblings. \n\"One of them has a feeding tube so I take care and just hang out with him and play basketball with him because all my brothers play basketball,\" said Haykal. \nSo it's no wonder Maya sees a future in medicine. \n\"That's why I want to be in the health field, to try to help people who also experience pain and struggles and teach them ways in which they can overcome it.\" \nShe's found who she is: somebody who just wants to help. That's why she's an Academic All-Star. To submit a comment on this article, your email address is required.
