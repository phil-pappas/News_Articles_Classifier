Third-and-inches, fourth-and-inches, coming up short just a couple of inches. In the battle of the inches, the Windsor football team had all the right measurements to secure a 21-7 win over Greeley West in a Class 4A Longs Peak Conference game at Windsor High School. The Wizards (1-0 Longs Peak, 6-0 overall) remain undefeated while the Spartans (0-1, 5-1) suffered their first loss in both teams’ first league game. Arguably the most key play of the game came with 5 minutes, 3 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Down 14-7, West was driving down the field and came up to a fourth-and-3 situation. After a timeout, the Spartans had senior running back Nick Trujillo run the ball and the ball was very close to the first down. The referees measured it and decided he was just short of moving the chains, giving the Wizards the ball on their own 46-yard line. “I was watching down the line (and) I thought we got it,” West coach Jason Renouf said. “But the refs saw it a different way, and so that could’ve been a change in the game right there if we got. I was jumping around ‘cause I was sure we got it.” Windsor’s ensuing drive led to a game-clinching touchdown by senior wing back Landon Schmidt from 3 yards out and 2:35 on the board. Windsor coach Chris Jones said the pregame speech Friday was about the players showing their teammates how much they care about them through their actions. “We were relentless,” he said. “Defense, they wanted to get off the field and they wanted it. I think we all pat each other on the back tonight. It was a really quality team effort offensively, defensively, special teams.” But the Wizards made several other big plays to put them in the driver’s seat, especially on offense. Windsor scored its first touchdown with an unexpected throw from junior quarterback Brad Peeples to senior receiver Brady Bowman for 47 yards. On the next score, the Wizards converted fourth-and-inches with an 18-yard run by senior fullback Jake Shields, setting up first-and-goal. “It’s a great tribute to the coaches having the kids prepared,” Jones said. “We had a couple drives down (near the end zone), didn’t put it in. That hurts (but West) had one drive.” Rush kill Coming into Friday’s game, Windsor and West were averaging more than 300 rushing yards per game. But both defenses cut that number down. The Wizards finished with 289 yards on 50 rushes and the Spartans had 150 yards on 34 carries. Windsor’s Shields dominated on the ground with 138 yards on 19 carries. “Offense, we did good,” Shields said. “(We were) slow in the first half, obviously, and then we hit that big one going into the second half to get momentum. But the defense did amazing. We had defense’s back and defense had our back. It was awesome.” West senior Tre’vaughn Gonzales was held to 50 yards and one touchdown on 14 carries. All about the D Windsor forced four Spartans’ punts and had another fourth-down stop late in the fourth quarter. West’s last effort came on fourth-and-7 with about 1 minute left. Senior quarterback AJ Lopez threw the ball to junior receiver Darren DeLaCroix but the Wizards batted the ball away. West’s defense came up big in the second quarter, halting a 14-play drive by stuffing Peeples on fourth-and-goal. The Spartans also stopped Windsor when it missed a 27-yard field goal early in the fourth. Up next Windsor goes on the road at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at Longmont, while West hosts Adams City at 7 p.m. Thursday at District 6 Stadium. Both games are 4A Longs Peak Conference action.
