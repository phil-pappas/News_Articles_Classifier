The match was pushed back by two days because of inclement weather and unplayable field conditions. \n\"Anytime you win a county game it's a great day,\" Valley boss Sam Roca said. \"Matt [Mihalik] played great and is cleanly handling the ball and distributing; our entire backline was outstanding.\" \nFifteen minutes before the half, Brandon Vecere sent his cross in the box, where Peter Leva's half-volleyed a drive that was initially saved but the rebound was knocked home. \nIn the 53rd minute, the Indians (4-6) made it 2-0 when Nick Thompson threaded a pass into the path of Alex Kasperowicz, who passed to Anthony Minnella for the goal. \n\"We're playing more as a cohesive unit,\" Roca said. \nPutting forth one of its strongest efforts of the season, Wayne Valley's backline clamped down, but it wasn't enough as Don Bosco Prep prevailed, 1-0, last Thursday on a rainy night. \nMike Helgesen netted the lone goal early in the first stanza off a feed from Max Geuder and it held up. \nThe Big North Independence starts up again when they go to West Milford on Tuesday at 4 p.m. Wayne Valley started the week with Clifton, falling 2-1 to the Mustangs on Wednesday afternoon. \nGotrell stays hot \nMatthew Gotrell was back at it. And that usually means trouble ... at least for Kennedy. \nGotrell hit for his eighth goal of the campaign as DePaul Catholic silenced Kennedy, 2-0, last Thursday in Big North Conference interdivisional boys' soccer. \nThere was no scoring in the first period, but Gotrell and Bobby Pombo helped stop the plucky Knights. Seniors defender Andrew Haggerty and Christian Sanchez earned assists. Junior Luke Van Winkle produced his second-straight shutout, making four saves. \n\"We played without four starters,\" DePaul head coach Steve Beneventine said. \"I just hope we get them back in time for the county [tournament] game.\" \nThe Spartans are back at it on Saturday when archrival Wayne Hills comes to Alumni Field for the Passaic County Tournament quarterfinals. After that it's back to the Big North United for the reverse fixtures, starting on Monday with St. Joseph Regional. The regular season matches kick off at 7 o'clock at Alumni Field. Tuesday's match with Eastside was cancelled, leaving Big Green with seven regular season dates left. \nElsewhere, Passaic County Technical Institute fell for the second time within a three-day span. \nJoseph Barile's double propelled Bergen Catholic to a 2-0 victory over the Bulldogs last Thursday in a Big North interdivisional match at Crusader Stadium in Oradell. \nNick VaFiadas made five saves to post the clean sheet. \nLast Tuesday, Ronald Kestelboym scored deep into the second overtime as Fair Lawn bested the Bulldogs, 1-0. Kestelboym's game-winner, his fourth of the season, was set up by Bryan Gomez. \nKevin Bueno made five saves in the net for PCTI, while Fair Lawn's David Vaknin also had five. \nPCTI will play fifth-seeded Clifton in the county tournament quarterfinals Saturday at 11 a.m. They also play at Passaic Monday at 4 p.m. in the Liberty.
