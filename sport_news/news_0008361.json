Courtesy of Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife officials had stopped searching for the wolf, who was last spotted in September 2011 near Prineville. He's been missing so long, the radio collar they would normally use to track him has likely run out of juice.\nAfter three years without a trace of OR-3, a hunter's trail camera picked up an image in August of a black radio collared wolf. Wildlife officials recognized the wolf in the photo as OR-3 and confirmed their hunch last week.\nMichelle Dennehy, spokeswoman for the state wildlife department, said biologists do not know whether OR-3 is with any other wolves and they don't have a good idea where he's been all this time. They'll attempt to gather more information about him now that his whereabouts are known.\n-- Kelly House\nkhouse@oregonian.com\n503-221-8178\n@Kelly_M_House", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Kelly_M_House", "http://dfw.state.or.us/wolves/"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:45:49.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
