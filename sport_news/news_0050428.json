(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) - \nWhen the Royals win, fans expect to see someone get soaked. \nSalvador “Salvy” Perez’s “Gatorade Baths” are a soggy tradition that have fans asking Royals announcer Joel Goldberg one question: \n“How is your dry cleaning bill?” \nKCTV5’s Emily Rittman talked to the local business in charge of salvaging Gatorade and champagne soaked clothes. \n“It used to be he would look over at me and start doing this 'shhh,'” Goldberg said. \nMost of Salvy’s teammates quit trying to dodge his antics long ago. \n“He always has this look in his eye. He might wink a little bit. He's got this big smile,” Goldberg said. \nGoldberg often gets caught in the crossfire and embraces it. \n“It’s always fun. The fans love it,” he said. \nAt Nature’s Touch Cleaners, they know they’ll soon get a visit from Goldberg. \n“Extremely wet, damp. There is no same day service for Joel or even next day service for Joel,” said Jeff Kutcher, owner of the dry cleaning business. \nGoldberg’s suits often must dry out in the boiler room before they can even be dry cleaned. \n“It gets stinky. It could get moldy, so he tries to bring it in the next day,” Kutcher said. \nGatorade can be a tough job. \n“As long as it's clear, it’s not too bad. If it's red, it's pretty difficult,” said Kutcher. \nThe task is an honor for Kutcher and his staff of Royals fans. \nKutcher said he would gladly clean up after a World Series win champagne celebration. \nHe does ask one favor of Salvy: please try and skip the red Gatorade. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
