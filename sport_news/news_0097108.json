By Mark Lelinwalla Filed Under Miami Heat , LeBron James , Michelle Obama , Cleveland Cavaliers , Sports News , Sports \nCredit the first lady with the assist. \nMichelle Obama made a trip to LeBron James's hometown of Akron, Ohio, where the two championed higher education on Wednesday. \nSpeaking at the University of Akron, James had 2,500 students recite a pledge in commitment to their education as part of his \"I Promise\" initiative, while he lent support to Obama's new \"Better Make Room\" campaign as well. \nJust two months ago, James announced that he's working with the University of Akron and Chase to pay the way for full college scholarships for 1,100 Akron kids via his LeBron James Family Foundation and \"I Promise\" program. \nThe first lady saluted him for giving back while stressing education. \n\"There's absolutely nothing more important than education,\" Obama said during a private Q&A conducted by ESPN's Michael Wilbon after the event. \"It is the absolute best investment that young people can make in their futures. I just don't think we talk about that enough. We don't shine a light on that.\" \nHer \"Better Make Room\" movement seeks to get successful students the same spotlight as star athletes and celebrities. \nSpeaking about returning to Ohio last summer, King James said the move to leave the Miami Heat for the Cleveland Cavaliers was just as important for the impact he could have off the court than on it, especially when it came to aiding the youth of Northeast Ohio. \n\"It was up there at the top,\" James said. \"If not first or second, as high as it could be. And just reading and seeing what my community was going through while I was away, it kind of hit home for me in understanding how big my influence is and how important my muscle is right now has nothing to do with the game of basketball. \n\"And so it was definitely in my thoughts and in my mind, and I can sit here today going on Year two since I've come back home and seeing I've set up something I can be proud of,\" he continued. \"And not proud because I've used my name, but proud of the fact that these kids have something to look forward to.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:32:28.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
