ASU overcame a fourth-quarter deficit to prevail 20-19 in Salt Lake City two seasons ago. Last year’s game in Tempe was a 19-16 overtime win for the Sun Devils. \n“Every year is a dog fight,” said ASU coach Todd Graham. \nComing close, though, doesn’t sit well with Utah. The Utes are especially focused on taking things back this season. They’re currently tied for first in the nation in turnover margin (plus-2.0 per game) with 17 gained and seven lost through five games. Utah’s 12 interceptions, thus far, currently tops the Pac-12. \n“We’re playing with a lot of confidence now,” said safety Tevin Carter. “Everybody’s doing what they’re supposed to do and it’s paying off.” \nLinebacker Gionni Paul noted that Utah’s defense is flying around and good things are happening. \n“We emphasize a lot about turnovers, opportunities,” Paul said. “Those opportunities will come . . . so we make the most of it.” \nIn last week’s 30-24 win over California, Paul explained that the Utes were extra motivated by hearing all about the Bears’ high number of takeaways on the season. Utah’s defense wound up with five interceptions and a fumble recovery in the game. \nLinebackers coach Justin Ena said defensive coordinator John Pease sets the tone. \n“Coach Pease does a really good job of making sure that we do emphasize takeaways as much as possible.” \nThe Utes, Ena continued, designate practice time to getting takeaways on a daily basis. \n“That’s such a game-changer,” he said. “You’ve got to practice it to perform it in a game. Credit coach Pease because we put a lot of time and effort into it.” \nIt’s part of the overall preparation that has helped Utah get off to its first 5-0 start since 2010. Extending the streak to six wins is expected to be a serious challenge. \n“ASU is a good football team and they’re playing lights out,” said Paul, who added that Mike Bercovici is a great quarterback and that the Sun Devils have an offense that's “hard to get a read on\". \nASU (4-2, 2-1) is talented on the other side of the ball as well, ranking fourth in total defense in the Pac-12 at 328.2 yards per game. Utah counters with a protection that has allowed just two sacks on the season — drawing obvious raise from quarterback Travis Wilson. \n“They’ve been huge this year,” he said of the line. “They’ve been doing an outstanding job and they’ve been protecting me.” \nAs such, Wilson emphasized that he couldn’t be happier and more appreciative. \nThe Pac-12 South standings give the Utes even more reason to smile. A win over ASU will give them an early, sizeable lead over the field — everyone else will have at least two losses and Utah none. \nWilson insists that being labeled as favorites isn’t altering the Utes’ plans for the remainder of the season. \n“It doesn’t change our approach,” he said. “We have goals that we set out to do and nothing really comes between that but just us trying to work hard and trying to achieve those goals.” \nTwitter: @DirkFacer Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:41:39.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
