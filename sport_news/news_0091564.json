Halfback Justin Forsett had the breakout game Ravens fans and his fantasy owners were waiting for, toting the ball 27 times for 150 yards. His performance was certainly needed, as a Ravens loss would've put them in a tough hole, per NFL Network's Andrew Siciliano . What's on the line for the Ravens?Only the 1992 Chargers have made the playoffs after starting 0-4. One team, that's it. â€” Andrew Siciliano (@AndrewSiciliano) October 2, 2015 \nOverall, this team has the potential to be much better than its record shows. \nJoe Flacco isn't super consistent, a point he drove home Thursday night, but he's still a solid quarterback who has a history of turning it on when his team needs him most. Justin Tucker is also an elite kicker, which is a major weapon in close games. \nAnd the defense did face Vick instead of Roethlisberger Thursday, but it still held an offense with two of the best players at their positions ( Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown ) to 20 points on the road. \nThat's definitely something to build on for the Ravens. Now, if they can only get No. 1 receiver Steve Smith back, they'll be feeling even better. The 35-year-old left the game Thursday night with a lower back injury, per ESPN.com's Jamison Hensley , and did not return. \n\nPittsburgh Steelers (No. 14) \nIt was really, really obvious, but the Steelers offense missed Big Ben. His pocket presence, instincts and deep-ball throwing were three things that could've changed the complexion of this game. \nIn Roethlisberger's first three games, his average completed pass went for 13.6 yards. Vick, by comparison, cut that in half Thursday night by reaching an average gain of just 6.6 yards on his completions. He wasn't taking the strikes downfield like Big Ben usually does, crippling Pittsburgh's offense. Don Wright/Associated Press Vick often had trouble finding receivers downfield, and he ended up taking five sacks. \nBut somehow, Pittsburgh was still in great position to win this game, up 20-7 late in the third quarter behind a rock-solid defensive job on Flacco and the Ravens receivers. However, Forsett ran wild to close the game, and kicker Josh Scobee (now public enemy No. 1 in Pittsburgh) continued a nightmarish season by missing two fourth-quarter field goals from less than 50 yards to let Baltimore back in the contest. \nAn AFC North championship is still attainable for Pittsburgh. But Vick needs to find a way to get loose for more big plays while Big Ben recovers, and the field-goal kicking must improve, whether that involves keeping Scobee or acquiring a new kicker. \n\nCincinnati Bengals (No. 5) \nBesides the Ravens, the Bengals were a huge winner from Thursday night. The Steelers' loss gives Cincinnati some breathing room heading into a Sunday afternoon contest with the tough Kansas City Chiefs. \nBut if the Bengals keep on playing like they have been, they won't even need that breathing room. Nick Wass/Associated Press Andy Dalton shredded the Ravens for 383 yards and three touchdowns passing in Week 3. \nAndy Dalton is doing his darnedest to change his status as the punchline of every joke with 866 passing yards, eight touchdowns and one interception through three games. Running back Giovani Bernard is leading the league's No. 8 attack on the ground, and the defense's No. 4 rank against the rush makes Cincinnati tough to deal with on both sides of the ball. \nThe 1.5-game lead Cincinnati sports over its division foes now could stretch out if the Steelers offense continues to struggle without Roethlisberger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:33:24.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
