That came in the fourth quarter on a 50-yard bomb, which he underthrew to Anquan Boldin and instead landed in cornerback Sam Shields' hands.\nKaepernick finished 13 of 25 for 160 yards and a 55.4 passer rating. His counterpart, Aaron Rodgers, followed up a five-touchdown performance by throwing for only one score against the 49ers and finishing 22 of 32 for 224 yards and no interceptions.\nCarlos Hyde had only eight carries for 20 yards in his return to Levi's Stadium, having run for 168 yards and two touchdowns in the season opener against Minnesota.\nThe 49ers next play at the New York Giants on NBC's \"Sunday Night Football.\" They lost their previous two games on the road, 43-18 at Pittsburgh and 47-7 at Arizona.\nWhen Kaepernick did try to stretch the field Sunday, overthrown passes often sailed out of bounds. Although he found Torrey Smith for a 47-yard completion to the 20-yard line with 5 1/2 minutes remaining, that series ended without points, as Kaepernick was sacked on fourth down.\nThe Packers went ahead 14-3 on their first series after halftime, using Rodgers' 17-yard scramble to the 1 to set up fullback John Kuhn's touchdown run. That nine-play, 61-yard drive was keyed by James Jones' 38-yard, third-down catch at the 49ers' 8-yard line.\nGreen Bay led from its opening series, going up 7-0 on Rodgers' 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Richard Rodgers.\nPerhaps symbolizing the 49ers' offensive ineptitude, Clay Matthews produced a third-down sack of Kaepernick in the third quarter and celebrated by \"Kaepernicking,\" with Matthews kissing his own right biceps. Bradley Pinion followed with a 30-yard punt, barely better than a 21-yard shank earlier in the game.\nWith three minutes remaining, a \"Go Pack Go!\" chant rang out among the strong contingent of Packers fans at Levi's Stadium.\nThe 49ers headed into the fourth quarter with a hint of momentum: Kaepernick completed a third-down pass to Smith for a first down, albeit only a 7-yard gain to their own 22-yard line. However, Kaepernick was sacked on the next two snaps, and his third-down scramble wasn't enough to prevent the 49ers' sixth punt in seven possessions.\nMason Crosby's 31-yard field goal put the Packers ahead 17-3 in the final minute of the third quarter. Crosby had missed a 44-yard attempt as the first half expired.\nPhil Dawson's 33-yard field goal cut the 49ers' deficit to 7-3 with 4:25 until halftime.\nWhile Dawson ended the Packers' shutout bid, it wasn't what the 49ers envisioned after a Boldin reception gave them first-and-goal at the 5. Consecutive sacks of Kaepernick pushed the 49ers back, and Vance McDonald fumbled when hit on a third-down completion, though McDonald recovered that ball at the 15.\nThe 49ers' offensive frustration was on display earlier, at the end of their second series, as Smith bolted for the bench and was consoled there by coach Jim Tomsula. Smith was the intended target of a poorly thrown third-down pass by Kaepernick. On the preceding play, Kaepernick magically eluded a Matthews sack, only to have McDonald drop a solid pass.\n(c)2015 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)\nVisit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732601", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732601&h=Packers+cruise+past+49ers%2C+17%2D3", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732601&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:11:11.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
