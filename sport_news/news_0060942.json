They aren’t going to admit Sunday’s game against the Colts has any more significance than the next one. They aren’t going to admit it’s personal because the Colts triggered Deflategate.\nThat’s what they’re supposed to say. They want it to sound like any other game. But former Pats safety Rodney Harrison , who was around for Spygate, provided a little insight and perspective.\n“Hell yeah it’s personal,” Harrison told the Herald via text message. “Indy caused Tom ( Brady ) to have a very stressful eight months not being able to have his normal routine waking up and always having to defend himself. And I would take it personally, too, if I were in the organization with the lost draft choices and all the embarrassment. So heck yeah. This isn’t just another game.”\nOffensive coordinator Josh McDaniels , meanwhile, portrayed Sunday’s showdown as expected. He made it sound like nothing special when asked during a conference call yesterday if there was more of a personal edge given what had transpired.\n“I really don’t see it any different than each of the other games we’ve played. I think it’s a very good team. It’s a road game in a hostile environment in a place that’s tough to play on a Sunday night,” McDaniels said. “They’ve got new people, new personnel. Look, they want to beat us. We want to beat them. It’s not very complicated. But that’s the same thing it is every single week that you play in this league.”\nMcDaniels then brought up a good point in that making it personal might impact how the players perform, and the thought of the Bills in Week 2 — being undisciplined and committing all those penalties — came to mind.\n“It’s very difficult to get ready for the coaching staff, the schemes they use, the players that are on this team, the environment that you’re trying to compete in, trying to do your job in, and to allow really anything other than that to creep into your preparation, it’s going to take away from your performance,” McDaniels said. “Whether it’s this week, next week, two weeks from now . . . they’re all different challenges. They’re all really difficult. This game is really difficult to prepare for each week. That’s why it’s so hard to win. I think our focus is going to stay on this. I know mine is. ”\nBill Belichick certainly hasn’t been the type of coach who would allow his players to get over-hyped in the name of payback. Harrison agreed with the notion it would be more of a controlled rage.\nPretty sneaky, Tom\nIt’s no secret Brady is a master of the quarterback sneak. He’s operating at a 92.6 percent success rate (100-of-108) in converting first downs, including 75-of-79 on third-and-2 or less and 25-of-29 on fourth-and-2 or less.\nHe went across from the 1-yard line in the second quarter on Sunday in the 30-6 win in Dallas.\nMcDaniels was asked the secret to Brady’s success.\n“It’s a small thing but a big play whenever it comes up,” he said. “There’s some little nuances to it that can help you be a little more productive in those situations. But ultimately, it comes down to wanting to do it. Your linemen have to do a good job of coming off on the ball. And the quarterback’s got to want to stick his face in there and try to find a way to get a yard, yard and a half. So they did it productively the other day. Again, you never know how many times you do it in the season, or you’re going to do it in the season. Usually when it comes up, it’s certainly an important play in the game.”\nBig plays, big problem\nDefensive coordinator Matt Patricia cautioned about the big-play ability of the Colts offense, even if the unit isn’t ranked particularly high in overall offense (21st) or points per game (24th at 19.8).\n“(They have) explosive skill players at the wide receiver position, dynamic players at the tight end position and then obviously with the addition of Frank Gore , I think their running game has really stepped up to another level,” Patricia said. “They’re top in the league in big-play runs. They’re top in the league in big-play passes. So it’s really allowed them to open up the complementary offense that they want to run.”\nGore is averaging 4.3 yards per carry. His longest rush from scrimmage is 25 yards. As for the wideouts, T.Y. Hilton has a 48-yard gain, and rookie Phillip Dorsett has recorded a 35-yard “big play.”\nBelichick, meanwhile, lauded the play of Colts newcomers Gore and wide receiver Andre Johnson .\n“Gore’s really looked good. There are a lot of great examples of him running the ball downhill, breaking tackles and getting positive plays,” Belichick said. “Johnson had a big game last week against Houston, but both those guys, it looks like they are still productive.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:17:01.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
