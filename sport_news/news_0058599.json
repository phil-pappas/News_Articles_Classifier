They are a very unpredictable side, and form and momentum does not count for a lot with the French. They can be poor one week and awesome the following week.\" \nIf there is any feeling of payback in Saturday's sudden-death encounter, Carter believes it will be with the French looking to make an emphatic statement. \nLes Bleus would be disappointed with their performances in this tournament, especially the loss to Ireland “and that’s a dangerous sign for us,” he said. \n“It’s one thing I have learned is they love playing the All Blacks in big matches and this weekend is going to be one of those and no matter what's happened in the past this is a separate game and I know the French will perform out of their skins.” \nWhen the final whistle blew in the French-Ireland pool match, which decided who would play the All Blacks in the quarter-finals, French coach Philippe Saint-Andre immediately claimed underdog status. \nThe French were at their best with their backs against the wall, Saint-Andre said, and he would know. \nAs a player, he sparked the move on full-time that led to the “try from the end of the world” at Eden Park in 1994 when nine players handled the ball in an 80-metre move before Jean-Luc Sadourny scored to win the game for France 23-20. \nIt was the try that gave rise to the term “French flair” and All Blacks fullback Ben Smith believed that naming New Zealand as favourites was the unpredictable Saint-Andre at his counter-attacking best. \n“I think the French team will have a lot of belief in themselves. I think they’ve been playing some great rugby so I wouldn’t say they're huge underdogs,” said Smith. \n“If that was us and we were in that situation we would have a lot of trust in what we're doing. \n“Whenever we do get an opportunity we really have to nail it. We’ve got to unleash or we will be going home.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:56:06.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
