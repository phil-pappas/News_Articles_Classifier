The one that fell behind 3-0 in another championship series, to another New York ballclub, and what happened next? \nRemember the 2004 Red Sox , they kept telling the media, and remember what they did to the rival Yankees before reaching the World Series and sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals for their first title in forever and a day. \n\"It happened to one New York team before,\" first baseman Anthony Rizzo said after the Mets won 5-2 in Game 3 . \"Let's do it to the other one.\" \n\"It's been done before,\" Cubs general manager Theo Epstein said a few minutes later. \"Rumor has it.\" \nRELATED: Believe it: The Mets are rolling toward the World Series \nEpstein, of course, was the GM of that Red Sox team, so he better than anyone around this Chicago franchise knows what happened 11 years ago. And he better than anyone should also know this: \nIt might make for a great rallying cry. But these Mets are not those Yankees . Not even close. \nLet's say the Cubs find away to beat the Mets in Game 4, maybe with an epic ninth-inning rally against Mets closer Jeurys Familia with some David Roberts-like base running and a 12th-inning win. Let's say they win again in Game 5, maybe with an even longer and more dramatic 14-inning victory. \nLet's say the Cubs get this series to 3-2, with all the momentum heading back to New York, just like the Red Sox did 11 years ago. You know who the Yankees pitched in those final two games of that ALCS? \nGame 6: Jon Lieber. \nGame 7: Kevin Brown, then Javier Lopez \nThe Mets will have Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom ready to go in that doomsday scenario, a pair of young pitchers who have already dominated them in this series. And that's assuming the Cubs make it past Steven Matz on Wednesday and Matt Harvey on Thursday. \nChicago is not up against a much-talked-about curse involving a goat. It is up against the strength of this Mets team now, the brilliant depth of its starting pitching. Stranger things have happened, but if the Cubs climb out of this hole, it'll be far more impressive than what the Red Sox did before them. \n\"The fact we still have an opportunity to come back and do this, of course you think about those things,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"You think about the parallels, think about the fact that that happened against a New York team. We think about all that stuff, but it's up to us to go out and play and execute.\" \nAs Maddon spoke in the make-shift interview room in a cramped space under the Wrigley grandstand, a few dozen Mets fans above him were hooting and hollering as the rain soaked the old ballpark. \n\"Let's go Mets — SWEEP!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:28:44.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
