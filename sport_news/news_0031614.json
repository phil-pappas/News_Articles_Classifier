Her family moved to Cedar Rapids from Minnesota in the summer of 2014. \nShe said the recruiting experience “has been pretty crazy, hearing from a lot of colleges. Sometimes it was kind of stressful, but overall it was an awesome experience.” \nSellers dreams of a professional basketball career someday. She plans to major in journalism at Liberty and wants to get into sportscasting. \nLocated in Lynchburg, Va., Liberty is a member of the Big South Conference and traditionally has a successful women’s program. The Flames played in the NCAA tournament last year and finished 26-7. Liberty was a Sweet 16 team in 2005. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:49:55.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
