The depth chart for the TCU game, released on Monday, confirmed it. \nKicker was listed as Cole Netten or Chris Francis. Netten, a junior, has struggled in 2015. Heâ€™s 7 of 12 on field goals and missed a 40-yard kick against Texas Tech last week. Francis, a redshirt freshman, is a walk-on from Dubuque. He attempted, and converted, one extra point last week.
