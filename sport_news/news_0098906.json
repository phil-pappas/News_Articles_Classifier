Complaining that he is being \"dragged through the mud\" in the FIFA corruption investigation, Michel Platini believes he is \"bullet proof\" and has not lost support in his bid to replace Sepp Blatter as the head of world soccer's governing body. The UEFA president, who has been suspended for 90 days along with Blatter, confirmed in an interview published Monday, Oct. 19, 2015 in the French daily Le Monde that he had no written contract for the $2 million payment he received from FIFA in 2011.
