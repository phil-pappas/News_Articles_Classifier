Seattle officially ruled Lynch out Friday for Sunday’s game against the Bengals.\nLynch injured his hamstring in the second quarter of the team’s 26-0 victory over the Chicago Bears in Week 3. Lynch returned to limited participation in practice on Thursday but is not ready to return. He will not travel with the team to Cincinnati.\n\"He could try to come back and play but we think he’d be vulnerable,\" Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. \"He needs another weekend to get through it and then by next week, by Wednesday or something, we think we can get him going again. We’re just about over the hump.\"\nBackup Fred Jackson is listed as questionable after suffering a high-ankle sprain last week against Detroit. Carroll was optimistic that Jackson would be able to play.\n\"We’re thinking he’s going to make it,\" Carroll said. \"He’ll have to work out on game day but he looks really good and we think he’s going to play.\"\nCarroll said the team may need to make a roster move to add running back depth before the game.\nMcCoy not close \nLeSean McCoy can’t outrun an injury to his left hamstring that could potentially sideline the star Bills running back for another month. McCoy said the medical staff gave him a three- to four-week timetable to recover from the injury he aggravated during practice Sept. 24.\nHe’s been ruled out for Sunday, when Buffalo (2-2) plays at Tennessee (1-2).\nMcCoy referred to himself as \"a quick healer,\" but acknowledged he doesn’t want to rush back too soon from what’s been diagnosed as a Grade 2 pull. That’s the mistake McCoy said he made in playing in Buffalo’s season-opener Sept. 13 after he was initially hurt during a joint practice with the Cleveland Browns on Aug. 18.\nHoyer to start \nBrian Hoyer has his job back as the Texans’ starting quarterback. Hoyer won the job out of camp but was pulled in the fourth quarter of a season-opening loss to the Chiefs after committing two turnovers. Ryan Mallett has started since then, but he has struggled and Hoyer took over in both of the past two games as the Texans fell to 1-4.\nPay day \nBills defensive Jerry Hughes was fined more than $30,000 by the NFL for incidents in last weekend’s loss to the Giants. Hughes, who has a history of verbally admonishing game officials, was fined $23,152 Friday for abusive language toward an official. He also was docked $8,681 for unnecessary roughness for head-butting Giants rookie tackle Ereck Flowers.\nRams receiver Stedman Bailey used the football as a pillow after catching a touchdown pass at Arizona. That cost him $8,681 for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nBriefs \nThe Lions ruled out running back Joique Bell, tight end Eric Ebron and defensive tackle Haloti Ngata for their game against the Cardinals. … Four of the Broncos’ starting offensive linemen were either hobbled or sidelined at practice this week and one of them, left tackle Ty Sambrailo, will miss his second straight game Sunday against the Raiders with a sore left shoulder.\nPackers right tackle Bryan Bulaga could return for Sunday’s game against the Rams after missing the last three weeks with a left knee injury. … The Redskins will be missing starting cornerbacks Chris Culliver (left knee) and DeAngelo Hall (right toe) against the Falcons.\nRaiders defensive back TJ Carrie missed his third consecutive practice with a chest injury and will not play this week, leaving Oakland without the most versatile member of its secondary against Peyton Manning and the Broncos.\n— The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:39.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
