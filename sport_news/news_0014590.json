I really liked the schedule last week and we rolled again (10-4 for week, 34-11 last three weeks and 50-28 on the year). If it weren't for the Giants ' miscues, I should have gone 3-0 on the Best Bets for the first time in a long time.\nAs it stood, my other two Best Bets made it look easy (New England and ‎Arizona won going away) and we are now 7-5 on the season.\nOK, but not good enough.\nI'm going to stay conservative here because I'm not in love with this week's lines‎ and I'm just taking two games. I hope to keep this hot streak going.\nVikings (- 3.5) over Chiefs : The Vikings will come out of the bye looking to make a statement and the Chiefs pretty much know their season is lost after last week's debacle, including the loss of Jamaal Charles for the season.\nThe Vikings can control the ball on the ground, mitigate the Chiefs' pass rush and Mike Zimmer will be able to exploit the many holes in Kansas City's offensive line. I expect Minnesota to make a push for an NFC playoff spot and I'm counting on the ability of this coaching staff to continue to bring this young team around week by week.\n\nExpect Belichick to have some tricks up his sleeves in Indy. (USATSI) \n\nPatriots (-7.5) over Colts : I'm going to keep riding the Pats. I've had a good feel for them this season and you never have to worry about their intent to cover -- because they never take the foot off the pedal. They are going to ride their stars and play to score every snap, especially when playing a team the coach hates, like the Colts this week.\nThe Deflategate emotion is real and they will be able to show Indy just how inferior they are. The Colts have never been able to stop the Pats power run game and Brady is playing out of his mind. Belichick will have some special tricks up his sleeve. Andrew Luck will be trying to feel his way back from injury and I suspect he gets hit quite a bit.\nTopics: Andrew Luck , Jamaal Charles , Indianapolis Colts , Kansas City Chiefs , Minnesota Vikings , New England Patriots , New York Giants , NFL About Jason La Canfora Follow on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:24:25.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
