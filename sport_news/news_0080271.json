Chris Cuellar , ccuellar@dmreg.com 4:21 p.m. CDT October 14, 2015 Fort Dodge and senior Sam Cook have started 7-0 and earned a No. 4 ranking entering Week 8's showdown at No. 9 Waukee. (Photo: MICHAEL ROLANDS/RECORD-HERALD) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIf Independence can go 30 years between playoff berths, it can be an underdog for one more night. \nThe impressively unbeaten Mustangs are one of four teams just one season removed from on-field struggle or mediocrity that are playing in ranked games for district supremacy on Friday. \n\"Last year was the first time the guys saw what it takes to win in district play, what it takes to win in a playoff atmosphere, and they've taken that next step,\" Independence coach Justin Putz said. \"They believe in each other, they believe in what we're doing. That's snowballed into positive momentum.\" \nGlenwood went 2-7 last season and hosts No. 8 Harlan as the undefeated, 10th-ranked team in Class 3A. \nFort Dodge is 7-0 for the first time in 70 years. PCM has turned 4-6 into 6-1 and a shot to take down No. 1. All these starts seem surprising, until you hear how the programs went from puny to powerful. \n\"Albia is a heck of a team, but we think we can go and give them a heck of a team to compete with, too,\" PCM coach Greg Bonnett said. \"We're playing with a lot of confidence right now.\" High School Pick 'Em: Predict the winners of this week's big games \nThe postseason drought ended last year for Indee, which overcame a 1-3 start and generations of low expectations to finish 6-4. That momentum carried into 2015, especially for senior quarterback Nicholas Holt, who has thrown for 1,088 yards and 10 touchdowns and rushed for 1,203 yards and 19 scores. That's 78 percent of Indee's total offense. \n\"(Holt) is the heart and soul of what we're trying to do,\" Putz said. \"He truly is a dual threat, and his leadership has been tremendous. Honestly, he's our decision-maker on offense but he's been great on the defensive end, too. I don't know if I've seen one player have the effect on a game that he does.\" \nThe Mustangs (7-0, 5-0) travel to Manchester to take on 3A-3 powerhouse West Delaware (7-0, 4-0) in perhaps the top matchup in an outstanding Week 8. It can also be considered the biggest game in Independence history. \n\"Our community is super excited, and the support has been tremendous,\" Putz said. \"When you have a start like this, it's really easy to have a great practice.\" \nGlenwood (7-0, 4-0) has found its stride under fourth-year coach Cory Faust, outscoring opponents by nearly 33 points per game. The Rams have saved their best for last, though: Games against No. 8 Harlan (6-1, 3-1) and No. 6 Dallas Center-Grimes (6-1, 4-0) will decide if they can go from two wins to a district title in one season. \n\"Cory Faust has done an outstanding job since he's arrived at Glenwood with their football program,\" DCG coach Scott Heitland said. \"It was obvious to us that he's doing the right things on and off the field, and he's getting a buy-in from his players. \n\"They're grabbing our attention not just for winning games, but the manner in which they're winning them.\" Football Super 10 stays stagnant ahead of huge Week 8 \nSenior Sam Cook stars for Fort Dodge, already rushing for a 4A-best 1,454 yards and 21 touchdowns while recording 33 tackles. That's all come in limited snaps and with excellent offensive balance, which the fourth-ranked Dodgers (7-0, 3-0) have used with ruthless efficiency all season. \nThey finished last year on a three-game skid and haven't looked back. District deciders against No. 9 Waukee (5-2, 3-0) and Urbandale (4-3, 2-1) are ahead. \n\"Statistically, Fort Dodge is the best team in the state, and that's a lot to prepare for in one week,\" Waukee coach Scott Carlson said. \"Defensively, I think we've done a really nice job of being better against the run. And we're going to find out this week if I'm right, my gosh. (Cook) is putting up 200 yards as easily as I'm breathing.\" \nBonnett felt like PCM had the talent to join those other teams making a leap forward, but it had to leave behind pieces of the scheme first. The 3-3-5 stack defense gave way to a four-man front. The spread offense that threw the second-most pass attempts (296) for the third-most yards (2,528) in 2A last year had to become balanced. \nSince the sixth-ranked Mustangs (6-1, 4-0) shook a bad season-opening loss out of their system, they've crushed the competition, and quarterback Logan Gilman has completed 78 percent of his passes for 17 touchdowns and just four interceptions. \n\"It's just good to see these guys that have worked so hard be in a situation like they're in this week,\" Bonnett said. \"Offensively, we added more of a run game to give our opponents something else to prepare for. Defensively we're back in a 4-4, which I feel the most comfortable with. \n\"With Albia, we could probably put 11 in the box.\" \nTop-ranked Albia (7-0, 4-0) has looked like a Goliath — the total margin in the Blue Demons' last four wins is 225-12 — but PCM has become more than a David. \nTransforming a middling record into a ranked power means they're in a group that's becoming greater than their underdog status. \n\"What we've been telling our guys is that this is exactly where you want to be,\" Bonnett said. \"You're a ranked team, and you get to play the No. 1 team in the state.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:23:06.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
