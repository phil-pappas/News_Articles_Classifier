JSU received several votes that were going to the Bison in both polls before they fell at home to South Dakota on Saturday.\nJSU received 108 first-place votes in the STATS Poll, 19 more than last week, and received 3,897 total votes. Coastal Carolina, who was off on Saturday, moved up one spot from No. 3, receiving 27 first-place and 3,743 total votes. Illinois State, James Madison and Chattanooga each moved up one spot to round out the Top five, respectively. NDSU fell to eighth. It marks the sixth-straight week that JSU has been atop the STATS Poll.\nIn the Coaches Poll, the Gamecocks climbed one spot to second but trail first place Coastal Carolina by just 15 total votes. CCU received 15 first-place votes to JSU's five and got 610 total points to the Gamecocks' 595. James Madison is third in the Coaches Poll, while Illinois State and Chattanooga are fourth and fifth, respectively.\nThe Gamecocks will play on the road again Saturday, when they travel to Clarksville, Tenn., for a 4 p.m. meeting with Austin Peay. The game will be broadcast on the OVC Digital Network and on the Gamecock Sports Network.
