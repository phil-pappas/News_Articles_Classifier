But we think the structure the U.S. Forest Service is building this fall is noteworthy. Not because the $889,000 in public dollars the agency is spending on the building near the intersection of 11th and H streets will hamper its firefighting campaign in a meaningful way. Rather, we’re troubled that this agency, which claims it can’t afford such basic tasks as maintaining roads and cleaning up forests overcrowded with trees and brush, can come up with almost a million bucks for a structure designed in part to house people who aren’t even year-round employees. Nor is the Forest Service the only federal agency with curious budgeting priorities. The BLM, which once shared office space with the Forest Service in a complex of modular buildings on the site where the new Forest Service building is going up, moved last year to a privately owned office just across H Street. The federal government will spend $2.1 million over 10 years to lease that building for the BLM. We don’t doubt that leasing that building, and building the new Forest Service structure, are the most convenient options for the two agencies and their local employees. But convenience shouldn’t drive decisions about spending public dollars. The federal government owns both the David J. Wheeler Federal Building, and the Forest Service vehicle compound, in Baker City. Workers might need to slide some desks around, but we’d wager that the existing publicly owned square footage in town could be made to accommodate the workforce. About another thing we’re certain: Had the feds diverted the $3 million for office space into road maintenance and forest restoration projects, the public would be getting much more tangible benefits for its money than buildings for which none of us has a key.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:29:53.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
