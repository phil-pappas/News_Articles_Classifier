Urgent steps required by Centre to contain this! We have seen the tears that onion prices have brought in the past,\" Sinha, a former Union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, said in a series of tweets.\nReferring to the Bihar assembly polls, the BJP leader left everybody guessing on who he favoured to win the electoral battle. \"I pray that the election results are also in favour of those who will propel our Bihar on the road of true progress,\" the 69-year-old leader said.\n\"This is a festival that celebrates the victory of Good over Evil, Right over Wrong, Truth over Falsehood and Humility over Arrogance,\" he said.\n\"Happy to be back ... after a break. Best wishes to all, specially fellow Biharis, in this auspicious festive season from their own Bihari Babu,\" the veteran actor said in another tweet.\nSinha has been blowing hot and cold with the BJP leadership since he was elected to the Lok Sabha for a second term last year.\nHe had even met Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad on a couple of occasions in the recent past, leaving tongues wagging.\nThe party leadership however, decided to ignore the barbs from Sinha to ensure that a confrontation with him did not escalate in the election season.\nBJP has so far not drafted him for campaign in Bihar despite naming him in the list of 40 star campaigners which was sent to the Election Commission before commencement of the poll process.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:49:27.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
