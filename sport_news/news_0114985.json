They’ve planned the most extensive renovation yet for next year, with an all-inclusive club section behind center field and a pub one level above it. \nThe Twins announced Monday they’ll create a premium area for about 120 members called CATCH. Season ticket per-game prices will range from $75 to $85, with snacks and drinks included in the cost. Those tickets will be sold through a random selection process. \nOn top of the new club will be a new pub called Minnie & Paul’s, in honor of the team’s original logo featured on the light-up sign that towers above the top deck. All ticket holders will have access to the space, with Minnesota-branded food featured. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:27.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
