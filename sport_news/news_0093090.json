It looks like quail hunters that remain after years of drought and low bird numbers are in for a treat. Robert Perez was right, and I was wrong.\nPerez heads the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's upland game bird program. When quail numbers plummeted in the extended drought, Perez predicted the birds would come back when it rained.\nI thought otherwise, that wild bobwhite quail numbers had fallen so low they might never recover. Quail census numbers in the Rolling Plains Region, after all, were in single digits from 2009-2014. The Rolling Plains, a vast ecosystem north and west of Dallas, has long produced Texas' most consistent quail hunting .\nTPWD has compiled a yearly quail census since 1978. Biologists drive 20-mile census lines during peak periods of quail activity and count the birds they see. The Rolling Plains long-term average count is 20.16 birds per census line.\nIn 2013, the count was a record low 2.91. Last year, the birds rebounded slightly to 7.53 quail per census line. Then came the rains. This year's count for the Rolling Plains is 38.29. That's the fourth highest count since 1978.\nAccording to Dale Rollins, TPWD's count might be conservative. Rollins heads the Rolling Plains Quail Research Ranch (RPQRR), a 4,700-acre ranch in Fisher County. With significant financial support from Park Cities Quail, the RPQRR is groomed for bobwhite and scaled quail (often called blue quail).\nSince the RPQRR project began, the best weather year for quail was 2008 when 96 birds were counted per census line. In spite of intensive management, the 2013 count was a dismal 1.8 birds per census line.\nIn 2014, the best weather year since 2008, quail numbers at RPQRR increased to 52 birds per census line. This year, RPQRR researchers counted 315 quail (they counted both bobwhites and blues) per census line.\nHere's the plain truth. We don't know enough about America's greatest upland game bird. Long-term, intensive research projects like RPQRR will reveal their secrets, at least in that region.\nIn August, my wife and I enjoyed a week of cool weather in the eastern Texas Panhandle on Boone Pickens' famed Mesa Vista Ranch. Like RPQRR, Mesa Vista is groomed for quail. We saw them in all sizes, from full-grown birds to chicks so small they could not fly. With more than 30 inches of rain through August, the habitat remained green, and we saw numerous pairs of quail still trying to nest and heard males calling in hopes of attracting a mate.\nKelly Reyna, who heads UNT-Quail at the University of North Texas, is cautiously optimistic about the quail corridor he monitors from Clay County to Navarro County. Reyna said he's seen a general increase in quail numbers. In some areas of good habitat, however, the population declined, probably because nests were flooded by high water in the spring and early summer.\nIn the South Texas Plains, the second most important region for quail, the quail census for 2015 is 21.05 birds per census line. That's above the region's long-term average of 17.5 and nearly double last year's count.\nIn the Cross Timbers Region, which borders the Rolling Plains, this year's count was 1.17. That's worse than last year's 1.34 and precipitously lower than the long-term average of 11.40.\nLast season, the Gulf Prairies and Marshes Region produced the state's top census numbers at 19.9 birds per line. This year, it's 14.9, still above the region's long-term average 10.71. You can check all the numbers online at tpwd.texas.gov.
