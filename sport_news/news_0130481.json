Allyson Ward redirected Lisa Elledge's corner-kick with a six-yard header for the golden goal in the 108th minute to give the Raiders a 2-1 victory over Northwest, the defending CCC champions, amid heavy rainfall and wind that blew up to 40 mph. With their fifth win in six games — a stretch that was preceded by a five-game losing streak — the Raiders moved to 6-7-2 overall and 5-3 in the CCC with three regular-season games remaining. Northwest dipped to 4-7-1 and 3-2 in the conference. The Raiders hadn't scored against Northwest in their last three meetings, but took care of that issue 65 seconds into the game when Presley Lambert caught NU keeper Lauren Patefield out of position and buried an unassisted 27-yard shot into the net for her fourth goal of the season. The Eagles tied it up in the 11th minute with Gabriela De Andrade's free kick that found Travis Bailey for a header. Both teams went scoreless for nearly 97 minutes after that, through the first 10-minute extra session. SOU fired the only four shots of the second until Ward's fifth goal of the season ended it. The assist was Elledge's team-high third. SOU, which defeated Evergreen 5-1 on Friday, hadn't swept a road weekend since the 2013 season. The Raiders also hadn'tdefeated Northwest since the 2009 season - a span of four losses and two ties. Kylie Moltzen made six saves for the Raiders, who had a 13-9 advantage in shots. They'll be back on the road next Friday at Oregon Tech before finishing up at home Oct. 23 and 24 against Carroll and Great Falls. Men’s Soccer NORTHWEST 3, SOUTHERN OREGON 0 : At Kirkland, Wash., the Southern Oregon men's soccer team ran into another stingy opponent, dropping a decision at Northwest in Cascade Conference play. A double-cross from Odason Pelogi and Jacob Weaver set up the first Eagles goal by Branson Corwin in the eighth minute. They struck twice after halftime, with Kyle Zimmerman nailing a 25-yarder in the 50th minute and Weaver assisting Corwin against in the 71st with a cross to an 18-yard shot for the final score. The Raiders (9-6, 4-6 Cascade Conference) were shut out for the second time this weekend and the fourth time during conference play. They produced nine shots, including three on goal, as Northwest improved to 7-5 and 5-2. Northwest got off 16 shots, eight of which went on goal. Daniel Christenson earned the keeper save. The Eagles have outscored their last four opponents 16-0 and won five in a row. SOU, which is currently tied for the eighth and final CCC playoff spot with three circuit contests remaining, will play one of the teams it's tied with, Oregon Tech, next Friday in Klamath Falls. Volleyball SOUTHERN OREGON 3, EVERGREEN 0 : At Ashland, as usual, the 12th-ranked Southern Oregon volleyball team didn't waste much time against Evergreen in a Cascade Conference sweep at Riehm Arena. The Raiders (17-2, 10-2 CCC) won their 17th straight home match and their 25th straight against the Geoducks in 25-14, 25-17, 25-21 fashion behind 14 kills from Tyana Andrews and nine apiece from Emma Gasman and Corynn Kopra. Evergreen (3-15, 3-10) has dropped 61 sets in a row to the Raiders. SOU's .337 team attacking average made these three more of the same. The Raiders hit .393 in the opening stanza while holding the Geoducks to a negative-.038 mark, forced sideouts after 14 of 17 Evergreen points in the second and hit .379 in the third. Lauren McGowne racked up 35 assists and six digs, Ashlyn Flynn had 11 digs, and Niki Small and Andrews both got in on four blocks. Gasman also helped with three service aces, and the Geoducks helped further by committing eight service errors compared to two aces of their own. Andrews totaled 31 kills in seven sets on the weekend, needing just 59 attacks. Small, the CCC's leader in attacking average, was also efficient against with five kills on 10 tries. Natalie Taylor led the Geoducks with nine kills. They hit .124 as a team. The Raiders travel next Friday and Saturday to Warner Pacific and Multnomah.
