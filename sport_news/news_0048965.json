Dez Bryant is seemingly getting close to making his return.\nAs Todd Archer of ESPN.com notes, Bryant took the practice field on Thursday wearing shoulder pads. While he was not expected to participate in practice with his teammates, Bryant was scheduled to go through some on-field rehab with an athletic trainer.\nAdChoices Archer reports that the Cowboys are hoping Bryant can make his return in Week 7 against the New York Giants, which is consistent with what we passed along a little over a week ago .\nThe initial timetable for Bryant’s recovery was 4-6 weeks. NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport later reported that Bryant is expected to miss 10-12 weeks after undergoing a bone graft , while ESPN’s Ed Werder said the bone graft performed should help and result in a 6-8 week recovery period.\nAll signs point to Bryant returning much sooner than expected, and the Cowboys need him badly. With a quarterback situation that is looking as uncertain as ever and Tony Romo still weeks away from coming back, Dallas needs to find a way to keep its season alive. Bryant would provide a major boost in the passing game.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/toddarcher/status/654687390716444672", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/cowboys-considering-quarterback-change/277647", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/dez-bryant-real-shot-return-week-7/276689", "https://twitter.com/Edwerderespn/status/645585099011031040", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/dez-bryant-expected-to-be-out-10-12-weeks/274660", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:45:07.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
