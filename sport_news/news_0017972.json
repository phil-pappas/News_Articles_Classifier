It happened, but it's not going to direct the rest of my life. So I'm still going to go race when I want to go race, but as far as the cup series it had no bearing on that.\" \nIt was also announced that Clint Bowyer will take over for Stewart in the No. 14 car starting in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:10:25.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
