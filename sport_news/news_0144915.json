He then did television work for a few years until joining then-Niners coach Jim Harbaugh's staff in 2013.\nMangini was a offensive consultant in 2013, served as the tight ends coach in 2014 and is now the defensive coordinator under first-year head coach Jim Tomsula.\nIt has been a long road back for Mangini, but one that is beginning to appear to be headed toward a third shot at a head coaching position in the league. Mangini is already being mentioned as a potential candidate for the Dolphins job due to his ties with Miami football czar Mike Tannenbaum from their Jets days.\nPLUS : Why Buffalo's criticism of Odell Beckham Jr. seems unwarranted\nSo how is Mangini doing so far with the 49ers? So far, it's been pretty so-so.\nSan Francisco has the No. 23-ranked defense through four weeks. The Niners are 20th against the run, 21st against the pass, and tied for 13th on third down, allowing opponents to convert 38.3 percent of the time. They are getting a pass rush, too, averaging over three sacks a game. Being ranked No. 30 in the red zone, though, has not helped things.\nBut the Niners' lack of any offensive punch has really hurt their defense. San Francisco is tied for 28th in points allowed, but it is dead last in point differential and No. 31 in yard differential.\n\"In terms of Eric Mangini and what I think of him, I think he's a fantastic person and a really good football coach, as I do with all of our staff,\" Tomsula said. \"From my seat, I've got to do a better job of having us, we need to start— not start, but we need to be better in some areas.\"", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/blog/miami-dolphins/post/_/id/17387/josh-mcdaniels-eric-mangini-top-early-list-of-dolphins-coaching-candidates-in-2016"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:34:27.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
