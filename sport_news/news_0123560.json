Land there was been reshaped for a spate of new home communities in that master-planned development. DEBRA GRUSZECKI , STAFF PHOTO Related article » Looking back, it seems the first slide Christopher Thornberg put up for the UC Riverside Center for Economic Forecasting and Development’s economic forecast event Thursday landed on our doorstep one day early.\nIt read, “Never mind the market, here’s the real economy.”\nFriday morning, stocks were down to cap yet another poor performing week. Folks were scratching their heads over a discrepancy in the job count. The Purchasing Managers Index for the Inland region sputtered.\nStill, Thornberg held his ground.\nThe job pace is still running at 1.5 million a year, he said, and a drop in employment is a lagging indicator to flat industrial production in the United States over the last eight months. “We may have slowed from 75 to 50 miles an hour, but we’re not going in reverse,” he said.\nThornberg flashed the slide on the screen because he said he’d just read a Bloomberg report that had an survey of economists predicting a U.S. recession in 2018.\n“This is one of the silliest things I have ever seen in my life,” he said. “Is there going to be another recession? Of course. Do we know when it’s coming? No.”\nInland Southern California lived under the shadow of the Great Recession for so long, folks fret everything’s going to come to a crashing halt at any moment because things are okay, Thornberg said.\nThough there are some headwinds, Thornberg said the labor market has turned the corner. The housing market is bouncing, and credit is expanding, he added, “We are not in a bubble.”\nA Claremont McKenna College Inland Empire Economic Forecast for 2015, delivered in partnership with UCLA Anderson Forecast, said the Inland housing market is showing signs of life. Even with home price gains, Inland home price is still 25 percent below the peak.\n“Those prices were the result of a bubble, and were not sustainable.”\nThornberg sees home price gains settling into the 5.5 percent range. The housing market still has at least 15 to 20 percent headroom on price, he said.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9423 or dgruszecki@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm8dx-b88530181z.120151002160854000gupcc3pp.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm8dx-b88530181z.120151002160854000gupcc3pp.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:05:24.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
