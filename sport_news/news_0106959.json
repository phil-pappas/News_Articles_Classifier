As the Bears (2-4) head into their bye weekend, quarterback Jay Cutler is off to one of his better starts, running back Matt Forte hasn’t lost a step and the defense ranks ninth after struggling for two years. Yet the Bears have been unable to win their first two NFC North games, and their two victories came in late comebacks against struggling Kansas City and Oakland. “I think we’ve been in most of the contests to this point and now it’s just figuring out how to win consistently,” Fox said. “And we’re not there yet by any stretch, but I think we’re moving in the right direction.” Better time management than the Bears had against the Detroit Lions in a 37-34 overtime defeat might make a difference. It was a past criticism of Fox in Denver and reared its head again. Getting well Getting healthier during the bye week would provide the biggest change. It’s possible most of their injured players will be back when they return to face the Vikings at Soldier Field on Nov. 1. A hamstring injury to Alshon Jeffery deprived Cutler of his favorite target over four games and severely limited the offense. “We’ve been dinking and dunking a little bit when he wasn’t in there,” Forte said. Jeffery returned in an eight-catch, 147-yard performance as Cutler threw more downfield, yet the running game and defense struggled in that loss to Detroit last week. Still to be decided is whether first-round draft pick Kevin White will return this season from shin surgery. Injuries have slowed the running game, as well. With center Will Montgomery (broken leg) lost for the season, tackle Jermon Bushrod sitting two games with a shoulder injury, and tackle Kyle Long still mastering his new position after two years at guard, the line has lacked cohesiveness. “We need to be able to run the ball more and that’ll open up the pass even more,” Long said. “And again that falls on us as an offensive line.” Chicago will need healthy and productive players immediately after the bye. Following that home game with Minnestoa, the Bears play three road games in four weeks, against San Diego, St. Louis and Green Bay. The home game in the stretch is Nov. 22 against the unbeaten Broncos, Fox’s previous employer. It’s a schedule that makes drastic improvement a necessity. Page 2 of 2 - Cutler playing well What the Bears have had going well for three games is Cutler, who had his own injury problems for one contest with a pulled hamstring. In coordinator Adam Gase’s offense, Cutler has operated more efficiently with just four interceptions and seven touchdown passes. “Everyone knows we’re not there yet,” Cutler said about the offense. “And we’re kind of business as usual.” The defense had similar problems with inconsistency. Chicago has allowed the most points in the league (179) in the first six games despite ranking sixth in passing yards allowed. “I feel like for the most part of the season we’ve been doing the right things,” linebacker Christian Jones said. “We just have to refine some of our techniques and things and just finish better.” They struggled with injuries, as well. An ankle injury took safety Antrel Rolle out two games. A knee injury sidelined defensive signal caller Shea McClellin, as well. And nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff played just two games following a suspension and an ankle injury. “We’ve just got to take this time, this break, to get ourselves healthy, offense, defense and we’ve got to come ready to go to work and get ready for Minnesota,” linebacker Pernell McPhee said.
