The group said on its Facebook page in September that conservatives are trying to turn the movement into a danger to officers.\n\"We're targeting the brutal system of policing, not individual police,\" the movement said in its statement. \"The Black Lives Matter Network seeks to end the system of policing that allows for unchecked violence against black people.\"\nPolice groups have bristled at that comment and pointed out people in marches drawing awareness to the issue have been recorded chanting for the deaths of police officers. During a protest outside Minnesota's state fair this summer, for example, some marchers were recorded chanting to fry police \"like bacon.\" Earlier this month, the parents of slain black men and women were featured speakers at the \"Justice or Else\" march marking the 20-year anniversary of the Million Man March in Washington.\nPresident Barack Obama last week defended the Black Lives Matter movement, noting protests are giving voice to a problem happening only in African-American communities.\n\"We, as a society, particularly given our history, have to take this seriously,\" Obama said.\nThe movement has become an issue in the presidential campaign. Some have taken its name as an implication that other people's lives don't matter, and respond by saying, \"All lives matter.\"\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Martin O'Malley initially took that tack but apologized last summer. At the Democratic presidential debate earlier this month, he joined the party's other presidential hopefuls in giving a nod to the movement. African-Americans overwhelmingly vote for Democrats.\n\"Black lives matter, and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country,\" O'Malley said.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
