Video of the Sept. 4 incident created a national stir. \nBreed had not spoken publicly until Thursday, but says he now wants to clear his name. \nThe University Interscholastic League suspended Breed for the rest of the school year but could have suspended him for up to three years. \nThe UIL also suspended the two players, a senior and a sophomore, from sports for the rest of the academic year. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:57:34.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
