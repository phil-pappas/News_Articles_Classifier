At the onset of competition Hudson hoped the Lady Warriors would be in contention for the fifth, or possibly even the fourth spot in the Lackawanna League standings. Chalking up the first two spots to the always dominating Scranton Prep and Abington Heights and the third position to Wallenpaupack, DV was eyeing up North Pocono and Valley View as its most evenly matched teams. Good First Half Although the Lady Warriors took a 4-1 loss from Valley View to open the season, they came back with two 4-1 wins over Scranton and Riverside to keep things in the positive early on. Back-to-back shutouts from Prep and North Pocono were somewhat expected but a 3-2 win against Montrose, a 4-1 victory at Mid-Valley, and a 3-2 win versus Honesdale put DV at 5-3 as they rounded the midway point of the season. “ Those were really gratifying wins for us,” said Hudson. “They were really tight, tough matches and we came from behind against Honesdale and Mid-Valley. Those comebacks were really big for us.” Fight to the End The 5-0 blow from Holy Cross to start the second half of the season was a bit unexpected but the Warriors banked a 3-2 win over Elk Lake to follow that up. They took an anticipated 5-0 whack from Abington Heights but then suffered a 4-1 hit from Dunmore to balance them at 6-6. They added to their wins when they handed a 4-1 defeat to Western Wayne but then ended things by getting shut out by Paupack at their last match of the year. While Paupack was the last scheduled regular season match, their bout versus West Scranton was still in limbo due to the Scranton school district strike. With no time to reschedule that contest, the Warriors were awarded a 5-0 win by forfeit, thus boosting their record to 8-7. That tied them with Montrose for seventh place overall in the Lackawanna League. “ Holy Cross was a tough match,” Hudson said. “We could’ve won. Individually, the matches were very close and we just didn’t play as well as we could. Page 2 of 2 - “ If it had gone the other way a point here or a point there we’d be 9-6. 8-7 is where we finished last year too so hopefully we can improve on that next season.” Senior Salute Two starters that won’t be returning next season are Lara May, who plays first doubles, and second singles player, Sabrina Schlenker. While the two took losses in their last home match, they’re both very proud of this year’s varsity squad and believe the team has a good future ahead. “ I thought the way the team played this year was very good,” said Schlenker, “ The team has a lot of young talent that’s just going to make them stronger in the next years.” “ Our teammates are awesome,” May stated. “I think the team is going to be very strong in the future and the younger girls are going to blossom into amazing players.” In addition to the Wallenpaupack match being senior night, the Lady Warriors were also clad in pink tye-dye to raise breast cancer awareness and as a part of the night’s activities, held a bake sale to raise funds for cancer research. “ The team really got behind the idea and we raised more money than we expected to,” Schlenker said, “I’m happy a lot of people came together for a good cause.” By Bill Deaton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:26:05.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
