Rosters were due at 1 p.m. ET Friday. Game 1 starts Friday night at 9:45 p.m. ET . \nMatz had been dealing with a back issue for the last two weeks and has not pitched in a game since Sept. 24. The rookie went 4-0 with a 2.27 ERA in six starts this season. \nThe Mets will likely start Matz in Game 4. He is not expected to join the team until they return to New York. \n\"In a perfect world that would be the plan,\" manager Terry Collins said Thursday. \"We'll make adjustments as we go but we certainly hope he's part of the rotation.\" \nIf Matz can't start, then Bartolo Colon would be next in line for the opportunity, although Collins didn't completely discount that Jon Niese had a chance.

Matt Harvey starts Game 3. \nSean Gilmartin will stay around as an emergency arm. Niese will be the Mets' lone lefty out of the bullpen, although Tyler Clippard will has an excellent track record against left-handed batters this season. The Mets will depend on Clippard and Reed in the late innings before getting to Jeurys Familia. \nYou can see the entire roster below. \nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com .
