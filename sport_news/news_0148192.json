He says the rest go to individual teams, business partners and others. \nFinkelman says fans like him are left to pay $2,000 a ticket or more on the secondary market. He believes that violates consumer protection laws in New Jersey, which hosted the 2014 Super Bowl. \nFinkelman will ask a U.S. appeals court in Philadelphia Thursday to overturn a ruling that dismissed his case. \nThe NFL argues that the only law that matters is supply and demand.
