COURTESY OF MURRIETA POLICE DEPA Related article » THREE THINGS TO KNOW - Freddy Perez Rodas faces charges of murder and arson\n- Perez Rodas admits to firing three shots at his wife, but says her killing was not planned\n- Perez Rodas admitted wrapping the body in a tarp, putting it in a storage unit and setting the house on fire\nA Murrieta man said it was a fit of passion and rage over a possible affair -- and not a planned attack -- that caused him to fatally shoot his wife three times at their home.\nFreddy Perez Rodas testified Tuesday and Wednesday, Sept. 29 and 30, during his trial at the Southwest Justice Center in French Valley. He is charged with one count of arson and one count of murder in connection with the death of his wife, Escondido police officer Laura Perez. He has plead not guilty to both charges.\nPerez Rodas never denied killing his wife, but said the July 23, 2014 incident was in the heat of the moment. And he didn’t hide his feelings from the jury.\n“She was a monster,” Perez Rodas said while on the stand this week. “She was detestable for what she did to me.”\nProsecutor Mike Cabral, however, spent much of Wednesday attempting to debunk Perez Rodas’ statement that his wife’s killing wasn’t planned.\nThe body of Perez, 25, was found wrapped in a tarp in a Moreno Valley storage unit after Perez Rodas eventually led police to the site. She had been shot three times.\nUnder questioning by defense attorney Johnnetta Anderson, Perez Rodas told the jury he confronted his wife after putting a recording device in her car. He told her he was going to take their young daughter away, he said.\nIt was then that Perez pulled out a gun from her purse, Perez Rodas said. He said he pulled out a gun of his own from elsewhere in the house and fired three shots at his wife, killing her.\nOne of the shots was fired at close range into Perez’s back, according to testimony from a forensic pathologist.\nPerez Rodas said he then put his wife’s body in a tarp, took money and important belongings from his home, then lit the house on fire.\nHe said he put the body in the storage use and later returned, telling a neighbor the house was on fire and that his wife might be inside. He told police the same story.\nWhen cross-examined by Cabral, Perez Rodas admitted he implicated neighbors as possible suspects in his wife’s disappearance.\nCabral also probed into Perez Rodas’ elaborate cover-up, asking why the man hadn’t called police immediately to report his wife’s death.\n“You weren’t thinking, ‘I better call the police, I can’t believe I did this, this was a horrible mistake?’” Cabral asked.\nPerez Rodas denied that he set his home on fire to get rid of evidence, saying he was trying to create a scene for his young daughter so she didn’t think he had killed her mother. He also said the reason for such an elaborate coverup was to protect his wife’s reputation.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviiqc-b88527469z.120150930160120000gcbcaro7.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nviiqc-b88527469z.120150930160120000gcbcaro7.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T14:27:42.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
