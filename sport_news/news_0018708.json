We know this is the year, the window, and so does the front office. Why not try and make some moves with some late round draft picks to some struggling teams? How cool would it be to get Anquan back for a 6th rounder? The Niners are going no where and they know it, i am sure they would take a 6th-7th rounder for Quan. How about any other vets on some terrible teams? Miami, KC, Houston etc. Why would ever do that. Last thing we need is another WR.
