He also attended Thursdays game against Auburn. \nRivals.com ranks Wood as the nations No. 14 dual-threat quarterback in the junior class, but UK is not necessarily recruiting him at that position. He was offered as an athlete and could play several different positions for the Wildcats. \nThrough eight games this season, Wood has completed 83 of 142 passes for 1,233 yards with 12 touchdowns and just two interceptions. He has also rushed 90 times for 877 yards and 10 touchdowns. \nWood, who also had a scholarship offer from Louisville, is UKs fifth commitment for the class of 2017, joining quarterback Mac Jones, running back Michael Warren, defensive end James Hudson and athlete Russ Yeast. \nOne of Woods high school teammates is five-star offensive tackle Jedrick Wills, who has emerged as UKs top recruiting target in the class of 2017. Wills also attended Thursday nights UK-Auburn game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:24:39.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
