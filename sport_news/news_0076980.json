WASHINGTON (AP) - An expanding investigation into Volkswagen's emissions-cheating scandal launched by state attorneys general could last years and will likely end in a negotiated settlement. Forty-five states and D.C. have joined the review, investigating how VW was able to game emissions tests to hide that its \"Clean Diesel\" cars emitted smog-causing exhaust up to 40 times dirtier than the law allows. The attorneys general are likely to seek compensation for consumers and redress for environmental harm.
