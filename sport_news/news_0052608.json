Second-year Flint Hill field hockey team is vastly improved A Staff Report Northern Virginia Media Services | 0 comments \nIn only its second year, the girls varsity field hockey team at the Flint Hill School has made a big improvement. \nThe Huskies won only one game in their inaugural high school season, but returned many players this year. So far this fall, the team has a 7-9 record and has won four games in a row, including a 4-2 victory Oct. 23 against Middleburg Academy. \nIn Independent School League play, Flint Hill has defeated Madeira, 2-0, and Holton-Arms, 2-1. \nIn its first year, Flint Hill began building a program mostly from lacrosse players who were looking to play a fall sport. Most had never played field hockey. \nThe school has started a junior varsity and middle-school program this fall. \n“This is a huge step for the future of the program because it means that girls will be learning the sport and developing their fundamental skills early on, so when they make it to the high school level we can focus on the higher level skills and competition,” Flint Hill coach Stefanie Vestal said. \nTwo of Flint Hill’s top varsity players this fall are senior captains Hayden Garrett and Kate Zecca, who led the offense with multiple goals and assists. \nJuniors Caroline Shevlin, Anna Krisko and Tori Herman contribute regularly offensively. Juniors Carolyn Holoran, Sara Paulsen and Isabel Rice-Martorell and sophomores Bella Stork and Nina Jenkins anchor the defense. \nSophomore goalie Nia Simmons has four shutouts and better than a 75 percent save ratio. \n“Together our defense has done a great job of moving the ball up the field,” Vestal said.
