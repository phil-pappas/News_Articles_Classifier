So it is all part of the learning process.\nAgholor entered the game with four receptions for 36 yards. He gained more yards than that on one pass play as the Eagles showed signs of having a vertical game.\nWith the Eagles trailing, 13-0, and less than five minutes left in the second quarter, Agholor beat Chris Culliver deep and made a sensational, one-handed, 45-yard reception to the Washington 30-yard line.\nMore coverage POLL: Can the Eagles make the playoffs?

Yes No View results \"I thought it was a great opportunity and it gave me a shot and I got to make a play,\" Agholor said.\nBut on the next play, the Eagles called for Agholor to run a reverse. Quarterback Sam Bradford handed the ball to Ryan Mathews who flipped it to Agholor. That's when it all broke down.\nAgholor dropped the easy flip and Washington's Keenan Robinson recovered the fumble. If Agholor had caught the exchange from Mathews, he appeared to have some serious running room.\n\"The play wasn't executed the way it should have been,\" Agholor said. \"I should have looked the football in. The number one thing is to receive the football.\"\nIt appeared that Agholor looked up to see how much running room he had. Eagles coach Chip Kelly said he felt the reverse could have been a big play.\n\"We thought we had a good look,\" Kelly said. \"The exchange wasn't there. We had the corner. Trying to get Nelson going.\"\nAdding to his up-and-down day, a penalty on Agholor nullified an 11-yard touchdown reception by Zach Ertz late in the first half. Agholor was called for an illegal formation.\nIt was another learning experience for the rookie, who was targeted four times and had three receptions for 64 yards.\nAgholor said he didn't dwell on his missteps in the first half. \"There are four quarters of football,\" he said. \". . . I just get ready for the next play.\"\nIf there was a positive, it was that the Eagles receivers were much more productive than they were in a 24-17 win over the New York Jets last week. In that game, Jordan Matthews was the only receiver who caught the ball, with six receptions for 49 yards.\nAgainst Washington, Eagles receivers had 10 receptions for 237 yards and two touchdowns, a 62-yard bomb to Riley Cooper and a 39-yard scoring pass to Miles Austin.\n\"We have been doing the same exact thing for three years,\" said Cooper, who had three receptions for 25 yards in the first three games. \"It is going to be there some games and it won't be there some games.\"\nIt still wasn't enough to prevent the Eagles from falling to 1-3.\nAgholor said he would not be beaten down by the early losing and was already looking toward the home game Sunday against the New Orleans Saints.\n\"If you put your head in a hole now because you are down, it doesn't really define who you are, it kind of just says you are soft,\" Agholor said. \"Guys have got to take care of their bodies, get ready for another week of practice and New Orleans.\"\nmnarducci@phillynews.com\n@sjnard", "external_links": ["http://polls.clickability.com/polls", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:40:52.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
