The Ferrari driver crossed the line in fifth but was demoted to eighth following the penalty. \nLewis Hamilton's victory in the race means Mercedes have an unassailable lead in the team championship with four races to spare. \nIt is the second time in as many seasons Mercedes have won the team championship in Sochi. Hamilton, meanwhile, has one hand on the drivers' title after team-mate Nico Rosberg retired from the race.
