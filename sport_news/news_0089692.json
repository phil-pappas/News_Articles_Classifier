I need to feel better to do my job, and I don't have that right now.' \" Advertisement \nMyers said he was hopeful Kerr would return in time for the Oct. 27 season opener. He added the team would be \"extra conservative\" on a return date and not pressure Kerr to come back in order to avoid potential setbacks. \nAssistant coach Luke Walton is serving as interim head coach after recently being promoted to lead assistant. \n\"At this point, I simply want to get healthy and back to my normal daily routine on and off the court,\" Kerr said in a statement, adding that he would need to do so to be ready for the grind of the regular season. \nKerr, who turned 50 this week, first tweaked his back during the NBA Finals. He underwent surgery in late July to repair a ruptured disk and then needed a follow-up procedure early last month after experiencing complications. \nKerr said at the start of camp he would likely need to take \"a little bit of a back seat\" but otherwise would be fine. He also added, \"I did not have any fun this summer, which was unfortunate given that we just won the damn title.\" \nThe weariness could be sensed during interview sessions and on the court as well. \n\"The first two days of camp, he was flat energywise,\" center Andrew Bogut said. \"He didn't really have a chance to stay on his feet long. He was sitting down every 10 minutes, so we knew he wasn't right.\" \nSaid Myers: \"I think he was trying to gut through it the last few days, and I think we all realized this isn't the time to do that. We're not in the postseason. We're not even in the regular season.\" \nMyers said he anticipated Kerr would get some distance from the team before having phone conversations with players and staffers. Myers added that Kerr would be welcome to observe practice as long as it wasn't too tiresome. \nWalton, 35, is the other coach besides Kerr on the Warriors staff who has won an NBA championship as a player. Walton's head coaching experience consists of leading the Warriors summer league team in Las Vegas in July, and afterward, he was promoted to replace Alvin Gentry, who left for the New Orleans Pelicans coaching job. \nMyers and Walton noted they had a veteran team that could handle Kerr's leave of absence. \n\"The type of guys we have, I think they'll use the respect they have for him and the fact that he can't be here, they'll use that to make our team better because they won't want to let him down just like he wouldn't want to let them down,\" Walton said. \nKerr's leave coincided with the appearance of player development consultant Steve Nash at practice for the first time. Nash is expected to remain a part-time employee -- an unfamiliar role that Kerr himself will for the time being have to endure. \n\"One of our team rules is, 'protect the team at all costs,' and he feels like if he can't have his normal energy and his passion that he has, then it's not fair to the team,\" Walton said. \"It's tough on him.\" \nMonday's exhibition opener \nWarriors vs. Toronto, at SAP Center in San Jose, 7:30 p.m. More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:18:34.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
