I am a disease intervention specialist in Indiana and work specifically with STDs like HIV. In Indiana there is a duty to warn law that requires anyone who is HIV-positive to inform any past or present sexual or needle-sharing partners of her/his HIV status. At the time of diagnosis, all providers inform the patient of this, and DIS’s like me are required to get a signed copy of this law from HIV-positive individuals. If individuals like this woman do not inform partners, then the risk is high for outbreaks. The person who wrote you should contact the Indiana State Department of Health’s Recalcitrant Program and inform them of this situation. All information is kept confidential. Counseling could be provided, and then if she continues not informing, legal action could be taken against her. — MELISSA MURAWSKI ARToberFEST brings vivid color to downtown Galveston \nThe Grand 1894 Opera House is hosting its 18th Annual ARToberFEST from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 17 and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 18.
