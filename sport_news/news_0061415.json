Jacksonville's Jason Myers missed a 53-yarder as time expired in regulation, then was off on a 48-yard boot in overtime of the Jaguars' 16-13 loss to Indianapolis.\n\"I didn't do my part today,\" Myers told reporters. \"I didn't have a great first game of the season. I came back the next week (and did well).\n\"I have to do my part next time.\"\nMyers, like many of the NFL's struggling kickers, can only hope there is a next time.\n(Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; editing by Sudipto Ganguly )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:57:47.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
