His previous appearances on the US Tour came through sponsor’s invitations.\n“I was just really focused on my putt and I hit a great putt to win,” said Grillo, who had showed he could compete on the big stage before, losing in a playoff to Alex Cejka of Germany in the Puerto Rico Open and tying for 10th in the Barbasol Championship.\nGrillo had a three-foot putt for the win on the first playoff hole but his ball just caught the left edge and stayed out.\nHe and Na both parred the hole so that sent them back to the tee off the par-five 18th again to try and decided the winner.\nAmerican Na hit a nice tee shot, but he chose to go with a driver off the fairway and hooked it behind a tree. That left him with a tricky approach shot from the rough.\nHe managed to avoid the tree, but his ball sailed past the hole and landed on the other side of the green. His first putt also went long, opening the door for Grillo to win it with a birdie.\nNa shot a two-under 70 in regulation to finish tied with Grillo at 15-under 273.\nThird place finisher Tyrone Van Aswegen, of South Africa, shot one of the best rounds of the day at four-under 68 despite starting his morning in a California hospital. He finished tied with Justin Thomas and Jason Bohn who shot 69 and 70 respectively.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:30:48.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
