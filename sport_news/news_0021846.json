Several years ago, the Aviators had a cooperative team with Wood-Ridge.\nHasbrouck Heights’ enthusiasm for volleyball is strong, said Streicher, who is in her first season leading the Aviators after several years at Emerson. She said the players pushed for more off-season volleyball to gain experience and that 32 joined the program.\n\"For a program that’s only been around for a few years, the numbers speak for themselves,\" said Streicher, whose team will make its Bergen tournament debut during Saturday’s opening round.\nHasbrouck Heights’ numbers are on the rise. Senior setter Rachel Dallara \"will never give up, regardless of the score,\" Streicher said. Junior Rachel Weber is among the team’s \"most consistent hitters,\" the coach said, and sophomore Kassandra Ketcho is the team’s \"power hitter.\"\n\"They have a never-give-up mentality that can truly make someone successful,\" Streicher said.\nShe said Hasbrouck Heights competing in the Bergen tournament \"is [a tribute] to the girls, the work ethic they have, the dedication.\" And securing the .500 record needed to qualify is not a one-time anomaly.\n\"This program is new, but they want it,\" Streicher said, \"and they want to go get it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:35.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
