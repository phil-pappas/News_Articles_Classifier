Tonight brings another tough Class 8A opponent in Naperville Central, a nonconference foe. \nBatavia put up another impressive win, 48-28, over St. Charles North last week, while the Redhawks improved to 4-1 after a 20-8 victory over Wheaton Warrenville South. Bulldogs coach Dennis Piron and Naperville Central coach Mike Stine know each other very well, and both expect the game to be a battle. \n\"I think it's a great matchup of two good football teams,\" Piron said. \"I expect some mid-game adjustments and a chess match out there. We're looking forward to it.\" \nThe marquee matchup \nThere's no question that Batavia will see the best defense it has this season tonight, and the same can be said in reverse for the Redhawks defense. Naperville Central is allowing under 10 points per game in a strong DuPage Valley Conference, while Batavia has averaged almost 40 points per game offensively in the Upstate Eight Conference River Division. Something has to give \n\"It looks like they have 15 players out there on defense sometimes,\" Piron said. \nThere hasn't been a defense that Batavia quarterback Kyle Niemiec (1,192 yards) has yet to solve, and with weapons like Canaan Coffey and running back Zach Garrett, a balanced offense has certainly helped. \n\"They are going to get their yards, but if we can limit big plays, that will be big for us,\" Stine said. \"We're OK with 16-18- play drives if we end up keeping them off the scoreboard. Their offense creates a lot of problems and we know we have our hands full.\" \nThe X-factor \nI'm going to cheat a little and take two X-factors that will determine the outcome, but they will certainly have an affect on each other. First off will be the battle of first downs. No, not who tallies more first downs tonight, but instead the yardage gained on first-down plays. Whichever team can force the opposing offense into second and third down and long situations will be in much better shape. \n\"They don't give you a lot defensively, so avoiding second and third and longs is big,\" Piron said. \n\"It's key for us to put their offense in those stressful situations, especially third and longs. If we can win that, we put ourselves in a good spot.\" \nBuilding off that, the second X-factor will be Naperville Central's time of possession. One way to not get beat by the Batavia offense is to keep the Bulldogs off the field. \nBest case-scenario for the Redhawks \nEating clock and imposing their will defensively. It's a tall task to stop the Batavia offense, but it will be the best defense Niemiec has seen this year. If the Redhawks can keep the Batavia defense on the field for long periods of time, with a few connections from QB Conor Joyce to Iowa-committed wide receiver Manny Rugumba and force a turnover here or there, Naperville Central and the Bulldogs will be in for quite the battle tonight. \nBest case-scenario for the Bulldogs \nStine will try to take away what Batavia does best, but what is that? The Bulldogs have done everything well on both sides of the ball, especially offensively with Garrett running the ball and Niemiec finding Coffey, Nick Stuttle and Johnny Fitch through the air. Batavia will look to impose its will with size up front to push around that strong Redhawks defense. \nChris Casey's prediction \nBatavia 35, Naperville Central 24 \nI'm sticking with the Bulldogs. Yes, the Redhawks have a good defense, but Batavia has a better offense. The Bulldogs won't make it three straight 40-point games, but 35 isn't too shabby. This team is on a mission, and I don't see a defense being able to outsmart Piron and Niemiec at this point. I think Naperville Central will have trouble with everything the Bulldogs throw at them. Oh yeah, Batavia's defense isn't too shabby, either. Batavia wins and goes to 6-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:13:33.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
