(AP) - Colorado and Oregon State play on Saturday night with each team hoping to avoid the Pac-12 basement. \nThe two are the last remaining teams without a win in league play. The Buffaloes have a streak of 14 straight Pac-12 losses dating back to September 2012 when they edged Washington State 35-34. \nBoth sides are looking at this meeting as a \"winnable\" game. Oregon State is slightly favored at Reser Stadium, but not by much. \n\"I guess if you look at it the way you're saying, to look at it and everyone is saying, 'You should win this game, this is a great chance for you, if you don't win this game uh-oh.' Which really is just talk, that's all that is,\" Colorado coach Mike Macintyre said this week, responding to a reporter's question about the dynamic with both teams in similar situations. \nColorado (3-4, 0-3) fell 38-31 at Arizona last weekend. It was the team's third straight loss and was the first of three consecutive games on the road. \nThe Beavers (2-4, 0-3) were coming off a 52-31 loss last weekend at Washington State, the team's third straight. \nMARINERS-MANAGER HIRED \nSeattle Mariners hire Scott Servais as manager \nThe Seattle Mariners have hired former major league catcher Scott Servais as their manager. \nNew Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto made the announcement Friday. Servais replaces Lloyd McClendon, who was let go earlier this month. \nThe 48-year-old doesn't have any managerial experience. He worked the past five seasons as an assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Angels, alongside Dipoto for most of that time. Dipoto resigned as the Angels' GM on July 1. \nNot only did Dipoto and Servais work together with the Angels, they were teammates for one season in Colorado in 2000. \nThe Mariners finished 76-86 this year. \nSALES TAX CHANGE \nMartial arts studios find out their tax status has changed \nSEATTLE (AP) - People who run martial arts studios are just now finding out they probably should have paid more attention to the Legislature this year. \nWhen lawmakers passed House Bill 1550 to streamline the state sales tax process, one of the changes they made was to reclassify some recreation and athletic activities as \"retail\" instead of \"services.\" \nKING-TV reports that change directly impacts martial arts facilities, which are now classified as a fitness activity. That means their students will now have to pay sales tax. \nGovernment officials made an effort to educate the public and these businesses about the tax change, but it's still coming as a surprise to some.
