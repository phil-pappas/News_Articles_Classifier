That’s what we’ve got to have from her to be successful. She’s got to be the first in drills, the first on the floor. Everything, she’s got to be the first. \n“This is her last opportunity to win a ring.” \nClemons, a Conference USA All-Defensive Team selection and an all-conference second team honoree last season, said she did a little soul-searching prior to the start of official practices. \n“I just had to sit down a re-evaluate things,” said the Coldwater native, who recently was named a Preseason All-Conference USA First Team selection. “Just think about what I really want to accomplish this year. Of course, coach has pounded it into my head. But it’s something I’ve really taken upon myself to do. I’ve got to be the first getting dressed, the first on the floor, first in sprints – whatever it is. \n“I just want to be there to set the tone for my teammates.” \nClemons has been a standout at guard since arriving at Southern Miss. Her career statistics validate how well-rounded her game is, scoring 11.4 points per game, pulling down 6.05 rebounds per game, dishing out 2.7 assists per game and 1.8 steals per game. \nBut Lee-McNelis knows Clemons can elevate her game to another level still. \n“As we know, Jerontay’s that player that’s an all-out effort player,” she said. “She plays on pride, plays on hard. She’s going to go hard. But if there’s one segment of her game that has to change, when she doesn’t have the ball in her hands, she’s got to make reads off the ball on offense and defense. \n“She’s got to step up and lead.” \nThat’s perhaps more important this season than any other. In the past, Clemons has had the luxury of leaning on players like Jamierra Faulkner, Tamara Jones and Brooke Rhodes to lead the team over the course of a season. But as the lone senior on a team that features six newcomers and two more players eligible for the first time this season, Clemons understands it’s her responsibility to steer things in the right direction. \n“I’ve been with coach for four years,” she said. “I know what to expect, what to do, what not to do, what to help the younger kids with. I’ve struggled and I’ve done all that. So I’ll be there to help them get through.” \nThe Lady Eagles are coming off a 25-11 season that saw them advance to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament quarterfinals in early 2015. The past two seasons, Southern Miss’ success has been marked by offense. Lee-McNelis’ squad led C-USA in scoring two seasons ago and was fifth in 2014-15. \nClemons said that could change this season with a team molded more like her. \n“I think we’re going to be a faster type of team this year,” she said. “We’ve got a lot of speed. We’ve got people who can heat the ball up just as good as I can. We’ll be a defensive team first who creates offense from defense. We’ll be one of those teams that’s getting up in your stuff, taking the ball from you. \n“I think the offense will come later, but right now we’re just trying to set the tone with defense. Defense, defense, defense.” \nSouthern Miss will host an exhibition game at 4 p.m. Nov. 7 at Reed Green Coliseum against West Alabama, before opening the season at 11 a.m. Nov. 13, at home in a first-round Preseason WNIT game against Alabama State.
