The future of our children starts right now and this is one way we can give them a positive experience they will carry with them. We are just having fun. that's all. I hope the police and fire aren't upset when my little kids beat them!\"\nAnd over 60 young bowlers from the Toledo Bowling Senate Junior League slid into their bowling shoes to hang out with Toledo Police Officers and Fire Fighters. Jacobi Coleman is 13 and is the Youth President of the Toledo National Bowling Association and says this is an eye opening experience.\n\"We know them a little better, and they know us, and we can build trust in one another and we can be friends and we help each other out,\" he says.\nKids from from Interstate Lanes, Toledo Sports Center Youth League and a Church in Rossford packed the lanes along side Toledo's finest. And they got to ask their own questions.\nAri Graham is nine and in the youth bowling league. She was bowling with Sergeant Rick Trevino and she asked, \"How does it feel like working as a Sergeant?\nSgt. Trevino says, \"It is challenging. but its a lot of fun because I get to come out and meet kids like you!\"\nHe says this is a good way to knock down barriers for the kids and for the officers and says, \"And maybe if we see one of these kids at a police incidence, there won't be that uneasiness. That uneasiness will be gone because we have taken the time and build a relationship and fortify a relationship as these kids become adults.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/F703381995754A509DA1D2DD0F63ABB5.jpg", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/F703381995754A509DA1D2DD0F63ABB5.jpg", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/68E/569/68E5690AB91A49B598BBAE80BBEBB1B5.mp4"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:14:47.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
