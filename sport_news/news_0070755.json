Miami head coach Al Golden is not a popular figure among Hurricanes fans, but it seems that they’ll have to put up with him for at least the remainder of the season.\nAdChoices Miami athletic director Blake James reiterated on Saturday that no decision on Golden’s future will be taken until after the season, when he will be fully evaluated, according to the Sun Sentinel .\n“Again, the thing you have to look at is if you lose [Saturday night], how many games are left?” James said. “And you win all the rest of your games? That’s why I think you always have to evaluate at the end of the year.”\nMiami fans will surely be unhappy with this, as banners calling for the firing of the deeply unpopular coach have been regular fixtures over Hurricanes games this season. His tenure has been marked by a lack of major victories and no conference championships. On Saturday, Miami lost to Florida State for the sixth consecutive time.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-hurricanes/fl-um-coach-golden-job-1011-20151010-story.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/banner-flies-over-miami-fau-game-calling-for-al-golden-to-be-replaced/273573"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:53:54.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
