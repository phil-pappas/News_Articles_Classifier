He’s going to be there. Brian’s a tough guy. He’s going to fight.”\nHe better.\nSuh is one of the best defensive players in football. That’s the reason Miami signed him to a six-year, $114 million megadeal in March. The Jets have to face Suh without starting right guard Willie Colon, who sprained his right knee in Sunday’s loss to the Eagles. \nSuh generally lines up over the right-guard spot. Winters will start in Colon’s place.\nWinters, who never has started at right guard before but did make 19 starts at left guard over the past two seasons, said he is not going to treat this differently.\n“I’m going to treat this like any other game and continue to work and study,” Winters said.\nRight tackle Breno Giacomini may be able to help Winters out at times, but he also has to worry about defensive end Cameron Wake, who plays on the same side.\n“We want to play versus the best players,” Giacomini said. “This is a big game as far as Suh and Wake being on the same side basically all the time. As far as guard and tackle on the right side, it’s a good challenge for us against two of the best players. We’ll see how it goes.”\nGiacomini has faced Suh before, the last time coming a year ago when the Jets faced the Lions, Suh’s former team. Giacomini said Suh is dangerous because of everything he can do.\n“He looks so big and powerful, but he has some speed and he knows how to use his technique,” Giacomini said. “He can get skinny. He can go power. He can go long arm. His tool box of defensive moves or techniques that he uses is pretty full. He can change it up at anytime and he is good at pretty much everything he does.”\nRyan Fitzpatrick Photo: Joseph E. Amaturo Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick said he is hoping he does not see much of Suh on Sunday in London.\n“He’s a great player,” Fitzpatrick said. “Obviously, he signed for all that money for a reason. He’s supremely talented. They have a few of them on that defense that you have to know where they are on every play and really pay a lot of attention to it. It’s him, but there’s a lot of other guys up front. They don’t have a ton of sacks, but they’re going to come because there’s a lot of talent and talent on the back end as well.”\nBowles was asked if there is a key to slowing Suh down.\n“Him not playing,” he said jokingly.\nSo far, though, Suh has not had an immediate impact in Miami. He has no sacks or quarterback hits.\n“I think he’s coming along,” Dolphins coach Joe Philbin said. “I thought he played his best game on Sunday. He’s done a really good job in the locker room. He’s an extremely hard worker, and football is very important to him. So far so good.”\nAs a team, the Dolphins have just one sack. Bowles said not to be fooled by that stat, though.\n“I know they can get to the quarterback,” Bowles said. “I don’t think you judge defensive linemen on sacks. When we played Indy, we only had one sack but you had 11 quarterback hits. These guys can hit the quarterback. The sacks will come. They come in bunches. I have no doubt in my mind that they’ll get theirs. I just hope it’s not this week.”\n  brian winters ,  ndamukong suh ,  new york jets ,  ryan fitzpatrick ,  todd bowles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:27:10.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
