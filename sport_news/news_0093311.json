The exotic-sounding conch, with its ostentatiously horned, pink-fluted shell, is the national dish of this beautiful chain of islands. And naturally, like so many culturally important foods, it’s also considered an aphrodisiac. So I keep trying it. I’ve had conch salad, conch fritters, cracked conch and conch chowder. At two restaurants. With the exception of the fritters, in which the conch is minced or pulverized, the conch in every dish has been tough and tasteless, like choking down rubber bands.\nAnd then, a couple of days later, I find out why.\nAlexandra Pecci Alanna Rodgers, founder of Tru Bahamian Food Tours, explains rum cakes at Tortuga Rum Cake Co. in Nassau, Bahamas. “Conch has to be tenderized before you work with it. Otherwise, it’s like chewing rubber,” says Alanna Rodgers, founder of Tru Bahamian Food Tours. We’re at a stop on the “Bites of Nassau” tour when Alanna tells us that the rubber-band factor is a sign of how adept a Bahamian chef is with conch.\nThe 11 of us on the tour, including my husband, Brian, and 5-year-old daughter, Chloe, are gathered around a long wooden table upstairs at Van Breugel’s Restaurant & Bistro, a power-lunch kind of place popular with politicians, lawyers and offshore bankers.\nVan Breugel’s conch chowder is indeed spicy, but delicately so, with a coconut-curry broth and hints of sweet Thai basil, instead of the dish’s traditional tomato base. The chowder is delicious, and finally, thankfully, so is the conch.\nAlexandra Pecci The chocolates at Graycliff, left, reflect the estate’s past life as a residence of royals. The story of Bahamian cuisine, which combines a mix of cultures, is peppered with colonialism, piracy and slavery. By now, a couple of hours into the food tour, it should come as no surprise that the conch chowder here is wonderful. Millions of people visit the Bahamas every year, but few of them will actually taste authentic island cuisine, Alanna says. It’s a fate that won’t befall us. Alanna has promised authentic, off-the-beaten-path Bahamian food, and she delivers on this four-hour tour that winds its way through downtown Nassau, largely eschewing tourist-thick Bay Street in favor of side roads and family-run eateries.\nInfluences of West Africa and the American South are especially evident on the tour’s first stop, a nearly 30-year-old restaurant called Bahamian Cookin’.\nBay Street might be crowded under the shadow of massive cruise ships and the crush of tourists who haggle at the Straw Market, sip daiquiris at Junkanoo Beach and snap pictures with Royal Bahamas policemen in front of the pink-hued buildings in Parliament Square. But it’s strangely quiet just a few blocks away at Bahamian Cookin’, where we dine on a typical island lunch, Bahamians’ biggest meal of the day.\n“If it does not have both rice and meat included, it’s not considered a proper meal,” Alanna says.\nLunch here certainly fits the “proper meal” definition. Our plates are mounded with savory, fall-off-the-bone steamed chicken, sweet grilled plantains, crispy conch fritters with a spicy dipping sauce, coleslaw, peas ‘n rice and a square of rich, casserole-esque macaroni and cheese made with evaporated milk.\n“This is the most down-home, traditional stop on our tour,” says Alanna, and after this huge meal, I can’t believe we have five more tasting stops to go.\nFrom the down-home cuisine of Bahamian Cookin’ we move onto its polar opposite: The regal opulence of Graycliff, a historic estate-turned-hotel that packs a little bit of every kind of culinary decadence: one of the Caribbean’s first five-star restaurants, a chocolatier, a cigar factory and a 250,000-bottles strong wine cellar filled with rare vintages from around the world. It’s also a hotel, where lush gardens, tucked-away courtyards and a mosaic-tile swimming pool give hints of its past life as a home to British royalty.\n“I always feel like we don’t do it justice when we’re here only for a few minutes,” Alanna says as she leads us through the estate’s lavish grounds and into a small room near the cigar factory where we sample Sands beer, a crisp lager that’s brewed in the Bahamas.\nChloe gratefully accepts the delicately handpainted truffles in the chocolate shop, where we can’t decide which is our favorite: the bright-green white chocolate Key lime pie truffle or the dark chocolate truffle with caramel and Bahamian sea salt.\nBy the time we leave Graycliff, we’re in the midst of a full-on tropical downpour. We practically run past Government House through the rain to our next stop, Van Breugel’s, home of that redemptive conch chowder, and then to the shop Pure Caribbean, where we sniff and sample specialty spice blends, goat-pepper and sweet mango hot sauces, and a guava jam that Alanna says she always brings as a gift for friends when she travels abroad.\nOur next stop is the most unexpected one on the tour: The Greek restaurant Athena, where we meet the exuberant, “Opa!”-shouting owner, Peter, who’s created a little slice of Athens in the Caribbean. The Greek dressing on the restaurant’s tomato salad, made with honey and fresh dill and oregano, is outstanding.\nOur last stop is the Tortuga Rum Cake Co., a large shop packed with wall-to-wall rum cakes in such flavors as banana, pineapple, coconut and chocolate. We try small bites of the bright yellow, original-flavor cake, which is sweet, slightly sticky and heavy with the taste and scent of rum. But that’s nothing next to the rum-soaked confections that Bahamians make at home, Alanna says.\n“It’s quite common for a baker to pour a whole bottle of rum over the cake after it’s out of the oven,” she tells us, making me long for an invitation to her house the next time she’s baking.\nIF YOU GO\nWhere to stay\nAtlantis Paradise Island.
