(Dylan Montz/The Gazette) Most Popular By Dylan Montz, correspondent October 14, 2015 | 8:40 pm \nAMES — Marcus Fizer was anxious as he sat in the car that rolled down the highway to his former home. \nIt’s been years since the Iowa State legend and former NBA player had been in Ames, and Fizer could feel himself getting a little jittery. Instead of making a right off the Highway 30 exit to go to the ISU campus, his vehicle made a left toward the Gateway Hotel where he and his family would be staying. \nFizer was anticipating the memories that would flood his mind. \n“We saw 16th Street and started coming around and I said, ‘I remember this when the guys were playing flag football,’” Fizer said. “Just to see Hilton Coliseum and see across the street to Larch Hall where it all began for me on the eighth floor. I can still see the little small window.” \nFizer is being inducted into the ISU Hall of Fame on Friday night and will be honored at the TCU-ISU football game this weekend along with five other inductees — including Eastern Iowa native Stacy Frese. \nIn three years with the Cyclones, Fizer was a consensus All-American, national player of the year runner-up and helped Iowa State to Big 12 regular season and conference tournament championships in 2000 as well as an Elite Eight berth — while he averaged 22.8 points and 7.7 rebounds. He went on to be the fourth overall pick in the 2000 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls. \nFizer has been a journeyman during his professional career, playing domestically and abroad, which has left little time to make a return to Ames. The last time Fizer was in town was roughly eight years ago, and somewhat of a favor for his wife. \n“My wife was craving some of the Pizza Pit wings and we just drove up one night from Chicago and caught a football game and just snuck out as best as we could,” Fizer grinned. “But it’s been awhile. It’s been too long.” \nAlthough he isn’t officially retired, Fizer and his family make their home in Las Vegas where his 17-year-old son, Aamondae, is a senior in high school where Fizer is an assistant coach. \nFizer also said he’ll speak with the Iowa State basketball team and talk about being in the midst of a coaching change, how he turned a pivotal moment into something that catapulted him into Iowa State lore. \n“It turned into something more magical than I could have imagined,” Fizer said. “It just continued to grow and that’s the most memorable and proud moment of being a Cyclone.” \nl Comments: montzdylan@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:02:27.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
