October 21st 2015 4 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/ \nNEW Penrith coach Anthony Griffin has put Jamie Soward on notice, refusing to guarantee the five-eighth will start the season as his first choice half. \nThe 30-year-old faces an uncertain future at the foot of the mountains with reports of him being shopped around to rival clubs following an honest conversation with general manager Phil Gould a few weeks ago where Gould suggested Soward retire and begin a career in coaching if he wasn’t motivated to play in 2016. \nMARKET WATCH: DOGS SIGN CENTRE, KNIGHT EXTENDS Jamie Soward looks on. \nWhen Soward first agreed to join the club in 2013 on a four-year-deal, Gould labelled him a “marquee signing” but a run of injuries and inconsistent form this season has left an air of uncertainty hanging over the former NSW playmaker. \nFormer Brisbane coach Griffin was announced as Ivan Cleary’s successor at a press conference on Wednesday where he was asked if Soward would start the season at five-eighth.
