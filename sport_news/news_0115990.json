But the St. Johns County high school pitcher fought like hell to hold back. \nAfter years of playing Little League and travel ball, wowing parents and players alike with her corner-cutting fastball and a knuckle curve that buckled boys’ knees, Piagno became a full-time bench warmer her junior year at St. Augustine’s Pedro Menendez High School. \nThe brown-haired, hazel-eyed young righty didn’t play in the field for those 2008 Falcons and remembers she pinch hit twice. She once watched as her younger brother, called up from junior varsity, hurled part of a game she said the coach suggested she’d play in, but never did. \nPleas by Piagno’s parents and her with head coach Keith Daniel for more playing time failed. Rick Piagno said Daniel told him his daughter wasn’t good enough. Her heart-broken father told her nothing, though she suspected being a girl played a role. \nBut Piagno said she continued arriving first to practice and leaving last. \nNever give up, she told herself. \n“You just have to keep on keeping on because, eventually, if you put in the time and effort, I do believe you will be rewarded for that,” said Piagno, now 24. \nDaniel said he was her “No. 1 fan,” but added that as a high school head coach he felt obligated to field a winning team with his best players on the diamond. He said Piagno’s gender didn’t matter. \n“She wasn’t good enough to pitch or play in the field,” said Daniel, whose team went 5-18 in his only season as head coach. “She wasn’t athletic enough. She wasn’t fast enough. I had better players.” \nSix years later, after a senior high school season in which Daniel’s replacement repeatedly started Piagno, she got buried under a pile of players after throwing the first complete game no-hitter in national women’s baseball history. The one-walk, seven-inning gem came during the debut of the women’s sport at last summer’s Pan American Games in Canada. \nIt was a defining moment in the baseball career of a dynamic young woman who is now preparing to take on the real world and the men in it. \nA FUN-LOVING TOMBOY \nRick Piagno signed his 5-year-old daughter up for tee-ball after watching her play ball in the yard of their St. Augustine home. \nAfter all, the rough-and-tumble girl — who fancied wearing basketball shorts and ball caps — easily kept up with the boys in her neighborhood. She ended up playing with many of them from Little League through high school. \n“I believe I just was another guy to them,” she said. “I was the girl during [gym] or the carnival who would be out playing football barefoot with the high school guys.” \nPiagno said she loved baseball and the man who would end up coaching her for years: her dad. \n“He was tough in the sense that he would always make sure I was practicing and I did my best,” she said. “But he never, like, made me cry.” \nPiagno, whose mother regularly came to her games, continued to improve as she got older. She also became a pitcher, hitting her spots with a fastball that reached speeds mostly into the high 70s. She also perfected a curveball with a 12-to-6 break caused by throwing with the knuckles of two fingers pressed against the ball. \nPiagno said she likes controlling the game and being the center of attention on the field. \n“I get to have a say in every pitch,” said Piagno, who grew up admiring Braves finesse pitcher Greg Maddux. \nAs the sport became more competitive, with fewer and fewer girls, Piagno learned she had to work twice as hard to keep up with the boys. Her competitiveness fueled her edge. \n“Being the only girl, I want to beat the boys,” she said. “That’s my mentality. I’m better than you. I want to play against you.” \nWOWING OTHERS \nPiagno said other teams and their parents who saw her pitch for the first time were, for the most part, respectful and in awe. That led to some funny moments. \n“One time I actually had a mom and daughter come up to me in the dugout. The little girl said, ‘I want your autograph,’ ” she said. “Apparently I had just struck out her brother.” \nKevin Kelshaw coached Piagno as a teen in 2005 for a Police Athletic League team and encouraged her to play high school baseball rather than softball. Kelshaw, who coached youth baseball for 22 years, said he admired her work ethic, gamesmanship and support of teammates. She was his only girl player. \n“The smile on her face when she was out in the field said it all,” said Kelshaw, a St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office public information officer. “She just loved the game of baseball.” \nPiagno said she had to continually prove herself to her high school coaches. \n“I had to show them I’m not just a girl, I’m not here for publicity, I’m not here for any other reason than the fact that … I played just as long as these guys,” she said. \nAmong her teammates was her brother Cole, who fondly remembers smacking a double off her in the same high school scrimmage where she struck him out. \n“I think it was a bad call,” the 22-year-old chuckled about the whiff. \nPiagno began trying out with the USA Women’s National Baseball Team while still in high school and made the team in 2012. The team plays international World Cups every two years. Players include mostly women in their 20s who play seven-inning games on a regular adult field. \n“We literally throw like the guys, we make diving plays, jump up and throw,” Piagno said. “There are a few women who hit home runs.” \nShe played softball in college and got a degree in graphic design from the University of Tampa in 2013. Though beginning to think of her future after baseball, the 5-foot-9, 160-pound phenom had no plan of giving up the game while so young. \nAnd then came the no-no. \nGAME FACE ON \nMarti Sementelli, a teammate of Piagno’s on the national women’s team, describes her close friend as a laid-back, happy-go-lucky person when off the field. But during a game, look out. \n“On the field, she is game face, game ready, means business,” said Sementelli, 22, a pitcher who lives in Massachusetts. \nPiagno had her game face on and then some when her team played Puerto Rico in July’s round-robin of the Pan Am Games, a summer competition involving thousands of athletes from the Americas the year before every Olympics. \nAfter a giving up a full-count walk in the first inning, she mowed down player after player and was supported by several defensive gems. \n“I was on, hitting my spots,” Piagno said. “I was just tying to stay intensely focused. Sometimes I would have to calm myself down.” \nBy the seventh and final inning, Piagno knew history awaited. She struck out the last batter and got buried in a pile of teammates. Moments later, they dumped a bucket of ice on her head. \nThe 9-0 victory led to a gold medal when Team USA beat Canada 11-3. \n“It was just amazing,” she said of the no-hitter. \nBut the competitor in her still found some fault. \n“People kept asking me through the next week, how does it feel to throw a no-hitter?” she said. “The only thing I could say was if I didn’t have that walk, it would have been a perfect game.” \nHer father, a professional forester, said he was happy to make the trip. \n“You never now what you’re going to miss,” said Rick Piagno, 56. \nTHE FUTURE \nPiagno, whose hobbies include surfing and caring for her boyfriend’s miniature Doberman pinscher, Molly, said she wants a family and her own graphic design business one day. She still lives with her parents and earns spending money painting pet portraits and working as a ghost tour guide in St. Augustine. \n“At some point, she’s going to have to get a real job,” her father said. \nFather and daughter still play catch, but not nearly as much as when she was young. She practices mostly with her brother, who can handle catching her speed. \n“Sometimes, like whenever my brother is really busy, I’ll be like, ‘Dad, can we just play catch?’ ” Piagno said. “I take it real easy.” \nIn late August, the Tampa Bay Rays invited Piagno to throw out the first pitch at one of their games to honor the Floridian’s accomplishment in the Pan Am Games. \n“I had to act calm, like I know what I’m doing,” said Piagno, who hit her target. \nWhile Piagno continues preparing for her next baseball tournament, she knows she’ll have to give up the ball one day. Until then, she’s determined to keep buckling knees. \n“I don’t like losing,” she said. \nNo matter what obstacles may be thrown her way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:06:55.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
