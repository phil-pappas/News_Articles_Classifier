Missouri's .280 hitting percentage was the highest Tennessee has allowed all season.\nBefore the match, Tennessee was fifth in the nation with a .123 opponent hitting percentage, and no team had gone above .250.\nThe Vols posted a hitting percentage of just .192.\n\"I thought we played hard for the most part, but we didn't control the ball as well as we have in the past or the way we expect to,\" Tennessee coach Rob Patrick said in a school release. \"All of our ball control was inconsistent during the match, starting with our serve-receive and continuing with transition.\n\"We got a little frustrated and felt we were giving points away, and you can't do that against a good team. Our lack of ball control really led to our inconsistencies in running our offense, both off serve-receive and in transition.\"\nMissouri (14-1, 2-0) won the first set by finishing on a 8-1 run, but the Vols came from behind in the second set to even the match. Bri Holmes had back-to-back kills to put UT up for good at 19-17. Missouri closed to 21-20 but the Vols finished the set on a 4-0 run.\nMissouri hit a staggering .500 in the third set with 18 kills and just one error.\nFor the match, Missouri led in kills by a count of 57-46, assists 52-37, aces 9-0, digs 56-49, and blocks 11-7.\nErica Treiber, Hembry, and Kanisha Jimenez led the Vols with nine kills apiece.\nMen's Tennis: Tennessee sophomore Igor Smelyanski's winning streak to start the fall season ended at 10 Sunday at the ITA All-American Championships in Tulsa, Okla.\nSmelyanski, who has already won three titles (two singles, one doubles) in the fall, defeated Iowa's Jake Jacoby in straight sets before losing 6-3, 6-4 to Oklahoma's Tristan Maraut in the third round of pre-qualifying.\nFreshman Jack Heslin lost in the second round of pre-qualifying to Sam Matheson of Liberty 6-4, 6-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:50:13.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
