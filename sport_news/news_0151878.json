By Diana Churchill At last, relief from the heat! The days are getting shorter, the cool breezes are blowing from the north and the birds are on the move. On the morning of Sept. 12, I happened to glance out the window at my parents’ house just as a handsome adult male Baltimore oriole flew out of the yew and landed on the oriole feeder. Finding it empty, he hopped over to the hummingbird feeder but could not get past the bee guards to the nectar.\nAs my mom rushed to the refrigerator to unearth the jar of grape jelly, we exclaimed over the early arrival of what is now a familiar winter friend. Once upon a time, (about six years ago), my parents could barely imagine that a Baltimore oriole might stop by. Now these colorful beauties visit on a daily basis from October until April. They slurp down jelly, guzzle nectar and fight over the morning ration of mealworms. When not at the feeders, they can often be spied in the camellia bushes dining on ants and other insects.\nThe next morning, I walked the neighborhood in anticipation, thinking that if an oriole had arrived, other migratory bird friends might be lurking. At first, all seemed quiet. Then, in one area of dense shrubbery, I heard a small chip note. I did what any avid birder would do — I “pished.” That means I made a lot of whistling, smacking noises designed to arouse the curiosity of whatever bird might be nearby.\nThe first bird that popped out of the leaves, bright yellow with black markings on its face, was a prairie warbler. The prairie is an agreeable fellow, not particularly shy, with a habit of gently pumping its tail as it flits about in the leaves searching out caterpillars, moths, beetles, ants and flies.\nAlso high in the canopy, I spied a male black-throated blue warbler and a female American redstart, spreading her tail to show off its yellow patches. On the ground, an ovenbird walked through the grass, probing for insects, worms, beetles and small snails.\n“It’s great to see you,” I enthused. “Eat up, travel safely, and come back next spring!”\nThat afternoon, I headed over to Hutchinson Island. As I was driving through a network of recently mowed fields, I spied a host of shorebirds settled into the short grass. “Strange,” I thought. “It seems early for snipe, and anyway, these beaks are too short.” After a quick consult with my good friend Mr. Sibley (his field guide to be precise), I concluded that I was\nlooking at pectoral sandpipers — about 200 of them! These medium-sized sandpipers have a distinct breast band, a striking rufous pattern on their backs and a sturdy, barely downturned bill.\n“Keep looking,” I told myself. “You might find something else.” Then I spied it — a slightly smaller bird, lighter in color, with a more delicate bill, a buff-breasted sandpiper. Long-distance migrants, buff-breasted sandpipers nest in the Arctic during our summer, and fly all the way down to southern Argentina for our winter.\nWhile I have made the acquaintance of this species on a few other occasions — most recently on the coast of Oregon last September — I wouldn’t quite grant it the status of friend. What a luxury to find one so close to home! I made pilgrimages to Hutchinson Island hoping for better looks. After two frustrating trips, I finally hit the jackpot. There they were — not one or two, but eight beautiful buff-breasted sandpipers feeding together right at the edge of the street. For more than an hour, I spent quality time with my new best bird friends, admiring their dove-like shape, the beautiful patterns of their plumage and the plover-like way that they did the “stop and pluck.”\nEventually, after posing for multiple photos, they flew over to the nearby golf course to continue fueling up for the long journey south.\nTwo days later, I had more cause to celebrate. On an impromptu trip to the Tybee’s north beach, I found a flock of 14 American Oystercatchers. I looked for bands. There — a red one. Could it be? Yes! HH — one of the two birds that I had helped to band on June 17, 2014.\n“Welcome back, old friend! If only you could tell the tale of how you spent the year since last we met.” Good birding.\nBird enthusiast Diana Churchill can be reached via email at dichurchbirds@gmail.com.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14772266.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14772266.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14772268.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14772269.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14772269.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14772268.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14772267.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14772267.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:15:16.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
