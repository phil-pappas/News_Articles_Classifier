Seven Toledo basketball and football players got money and other gifts to alter their play in games a decade ago. \nKaram’s lawyer says he’s in his 80s and has poor health. He says it would be “unthinkable” to send Karam to prison. In June, Manni was sentenced to nearly six years in prison for the Toledo scheme and other crimes. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:09:54.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
