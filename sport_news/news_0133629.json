We’ll recover really well and get into all the reviews and previews and all the rest, and get into the week. \n“It’s a short turnaround. But how exciting – we’re very happy.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:58:43.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
