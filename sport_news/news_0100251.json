The girls finished the season less than 25 miles down the road in Winfield at State. Four girls qualified for state this year, as Wellington sent two doubles teams to Winfield. Sisters Madison (senior) and Mekenna Adams (sophomore) played competitive doubles for the first time this year, and played well, as each earned their second trip to the state meet. Senior Dietra Sober and junior Madison Lewellen had even less experience playing together, playing just four meets together before regionals. Still, they were able to earn the first trip to state for either of them. State tennis was a two-day event, taking place on Friday and Saturday at the T.H. Vaughan Tennis Center in Winfield. Despite a thrilling win over a tandem from Parsons who had beaten them earlier in the season at Tournament of Champions, Sober and Lewellen were eliminated on day one after an 8-10 tiebreaker loss to Spring Hill. “That (win over Parsons) felt really good and showed us how well our two girls had improved,” coach Brian Aufdengarten said of Sober and Lewellen. The Adams sisters were able to fare a little better, advancing to Saturday and ensuring themselves a medal. They knocked off Chanute 6-1, 6-2 in their first match before defeating Bishop Miege 6-4, 7-5 on Friday. They wrapped up day one by falling to McPherson 0-6, 3-6. “We knew we were going to finish between fifth and 12th,” Aufdengarten said. “I told the girls ‘Let’s get greedy; now that we are going to medal, let’s improve our position after each match.’” After falling behind 1-4 to Parsons, the sisters rallied to win eight straight games to win 9-4. They then lost a hard-fought match to Smoky Valley, 9-6. Assistant coach Daphne Adams, as usual, was wearing two hats — coach and mom. “As a coach, I thought the girls played well. They put it all together at regionals and kept it going. They both stepped up parts of their game. They had great teamwork and competed hard.” “As a mom, I am so proud of the girls. It isn’t every day you get to have your kids compete together and to medal at state. That was just awesome.” The sisters were able to knock off Collegiate in their final match to finish seventh in the state. For senior Madison, she didn’t have any particular expectations heading into state. “I felt we played pretty well; we just wanted to play the best we could,” Madison said. She also said she didn’t know how playing with her sister would go, but she thinks it turned out well.

She’s halfway there after medaling as a freshman a year ago, and again over the weekend. Playing with her sister was a memorable experience as well. “It’s a pretty incredible experience. Even though it may have been tough at times, we made some memories that we will cherish forever. Mekenna also said that Coach Aufdengarten told the girls that they are the first sisters doubles team in WHS history to qualify for state tennis. But the team was more than just the two sisters. Nor was it just the four girls who qualified for state. The coaches were pleased with how the whole team performed this season, despite some injuries early in the season. “I’m very pleased with our performance at state,” Aufdengarten said. “The season was a good one all around, taking second at JV League, finishing third at regionals and 12th (overall) at state. We have such good girls on the team and the bonds you form with them mean a lot.” By Derrick Mead   By Derrick Mead", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:07:50.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
