But at a place where the equivalent of a Mario Kart red turtle shell can strike at any time, “strategy” mostly equals “luck.”\n“I think it was Mike Tyson who used to say that everybody has a plan until they get in the ring,” Brad Keselowski said Friday. “Well, Talladega is the same way. Everybody has a plan here or an approach until they drop the green — and then it usually doesn’t work.”\nJust look at Kyle Busch last season. After finishing third and fifth in the first two races of Round 2 in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, Busch headed to Talladega second in the point standings and seemingly a virtual lock to advance to Round 3.\nAll Busch had to do was avoid disaster. So what did he do? He dropped to the back, well behind the main swarm of cars, and played it conservative.\nThat was the smart move.\nBut when he slowed down for a wreck in front of him, Austin Dillon did not. Dillon plowed into Busch’s car from behind, and Busch finished the race in 40th place. He missed the next round by seven points, and it was because something happened that was out of his control.\nBusch has spent a year wondering what he could have done differently. His theory is perhaps if he had raced in the lead pack and there was a wreck, all his competitors would have crashed with him, thus nullifying the bad finish.\n\"Race with all the rest of the Chasers and if they all get caught up in a wreck and we do too, then (the points will be) all the same instead of me just being the only guy down at the bottom of the totem pole,\" Busch said before the start of the second round.\nThe Joe Gibbs Racing driver isn’t in position to try such a strategy this year — he’s currently one of four drivers on the outside of the playoff picture entering Sunday — but others could still attempt the Kyle Busch Method.\nHowever, some of them seem to have been scared off by what happened to Busch.\nDenny Hamlin, Busch’s JGR teammate, is in second place and 18 points clear of ninth. But Hamlin doesn’t want to drop to the back.\n“I don't think 18 is enough to just go out there and ride around,” he said after last week's race at Kansas Speedway. “I just don't think that's safe. … My gut feeling is we'll probably have to go there and race hard.”\nBut here’s the thing: Even though Busch’s strategy failed last year, that’s still the correct approach. It’s simply not worth it to chance racing amongst the pack early in a 500-mile race. That’s a great recipe for early elimination.\nGranted, no strategy is proven at Talladega. And there are no guarantees, as Busch found out. But the best approach at this 2.66-mile minefield is to minimize risk.\nAnd to minimize risk, stay away from as many cars as possible until the last 100 miles. Let others do the wrecking instead.\nIt didn’t work for Busch, but that doesn’t mean it’s the wrong strategy for a driver with any sort of decent points cushion inside the top eight.\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck\n© John David Mercer, USA TODAY Spor John David Mercer, USA TODAY Spor Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jeff_gluck", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:24:46.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
