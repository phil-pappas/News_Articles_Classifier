Not that I don’t think Sandy Lewis shouldn’t have been picked, I don’t know her nor anything about her. What I do know is that Mike Meyer is like a breath of fresh air, just by reading his letters to the editor. He has a fresh view and heaven knows we need that. He showed his mettle by the sad theft of his garden at the community plot, Mike handled it with a sense of humor as well as a touch of sadness. I just hope Mike continues to write often, I would also like him to know he has more voices like his than he realizes in Baker City. I have found no better city to be retired in and I don’t know if there is one. Baker City is a great unknown on the map and every once in a while it is refreshing that someone of Mike’s obvious quality finds us. Thanks, Mike, and next year when my fruit trees produce (weather permitting, something you’ll learn about Baker City) I will gladly share my harvest with you and your wife. If you see a tall man carrying a stick out walking early in the morning with his lovely wife by his side, stop and say hi.
