Now, Sona thinks it’s time she took up new challenges. The Dabangg girl has signed three back-to-back author backed roles ( Akira, Force 2 and the Haseena Parkar biopic ). Talking about her first biopic (on the life of Dawood Ibrahim’s sister), Sonakshi reveals that despite being a little apprehensive initially, she’s quite kicked about the film. Excerpts:\nExcited about playing Dawood Ibrahim’s sister Haseena in her biopic?\nYes, I am. It’s a powerful role, a great script and a story which will translate very well on screen. I am looking forward to getting into character for this one.\nWere you, even at any point, sceptical about being a part of the film?\nInitially, because of the sensitive subject. That’s when I went to my dad for advice and he said as an actor, this kind of a role is a rarity. He was the one who encouraged me to do it.\nThis would be your first biopic. Is there a particular strategy you are adopting to play Haseena on screen? Are you doing any kind of research?\nA lot of research has been done by my director Apoorva Lakhia and producer Mubina Rattonsey. They have shown me a lot of material which will help me in understanding the character. I will have to meet her daughters at some point of time to gauge what kind of person she was and understand her nuances. I want to prepare well for this role.\nWill we see you speaking in a certain way for the film?\nYes, I will have to get the language and accent right.\nMore and more roles for women are being written and played out. Agree?\nYes, I totally agree. It’s a great shift as audiences have become keen to see different kinds of films on screen.\nYou were part of multi-crore blockbusters and then you had critics raving about Lootera. Do you think your next few films, especially Akira and Haseena will notch up your credibility as an actress?\nNobody doubted my credibility as an actress even in the multi-crore films that I have done. If anything, they have always questioned my choice of role and I take that as a compliment because that is how much more they expect from me. After Akira, they will stop questioning that as well. I have reached that stage where I want to try out different things and challenge myself as an actor. It’s a very personal decision and it came from within, not because of any pressures from outside. This is my journey as an actor and I will take every step on my own terms and conditions.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://www.google.com/+nayandeeprakshit"], "published": "2015-10-09T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:40:17.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
