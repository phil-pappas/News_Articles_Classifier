The Cougars were so effective against Wilson, holding him to 1.3 yards per carry, that the Wildcats only gave him six rushes, taking one of their best players out of the game. What went wrong \nWildcats punt returner Nate Phillips only fielded one punt, but he made it count, returning it 69 yards for a touchdown in the first half. The Cougars have given up four special teams touchdowns, two kickoffs and two punts, more than any other FBS team. Difference maker \nGabe Marks set a school record with four receiving touchdowns, each crucial to the close win. His three first-half scores gave WSU a 10-point halftime lead and his final touchdown put the game just out of reach during UA’s comeback bid. It was over when \nUA scored its final touchdown with just enough time on the clock to get the ball back with about 20 seconds left. But Gerard Wicks’ 1-yard rush on third down was just enough to move the chains and secure a win for the Cougars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:38:32.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
