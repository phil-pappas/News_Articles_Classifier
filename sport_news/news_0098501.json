He dropped to the ground in obvious pain and buried his head in the crevice of his bent elbow. After a few minutes on the ground, Holt limped slowly off the field and was replaced by Allen Craig.\nOfficial word from the Red Sox was that Holt suffered a left knee bruise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:08:06.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
