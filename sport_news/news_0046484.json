Junior QB Taylor Powell directs Coach Daryl Patton’s up-tempo offense, completing more than 75 percent of his passes with 24 TDs and just two interceptions. Patton’s offense enjoys trickery, running more than a dozen gadget plays with great success. Fayetteville’s defense held Springdale High to a season-low 161 yards last week, including 17 rushes for 17 yards, in a 70-21 “Battle of the Bulldogs” blowout. \nHar-Ber 3-4 schemes to slow Fayetteville with statistically the best defense in the West. Har-Ber has recorded 17 sacks (2.8 per game), caused 10 fumbles and blocked three field goals. Har-Ber has intercepted just three passes this season. \nSenior linebacker Jacob Robertson (315-pound bench press, 300-pound power clean) leads the Wildcats with 8.2 tackles weekly and five stops for loss. Cornerback Bryton Cook (32 tackles) and linebacker Oliver Nasilai (30 tackles) are super sophomores. Sophomore cornerback Blaze Brothers, son of former Razorback cornerback Richard Brothers , intercepted a pass to seal last week’s victory over Bentonville. \n“They key with Fayetteville is being good fundamentally, tackling people in open space,” Chris Wood. “We’ve been hot and cold tackling. It’s something we work on daily.” \nBalanced Har-Ber (209 yards passing and 194 rushing weekly) averages 38 points. QB Fuller Chandler, on the Farm Bureau Awards watch list for Class 7A/6A Offensive Player of the Year, completes 64 percent of his passes for 190 yards weekly. Chandler has a 135.3 QB rating with 16 TDs and two interceptions but passed for just 38 yards last week. \n7A West \nSpringdale at BENTONVILLE (33): Bentonville bounces back from its first loss in 16 outings. Springdale headed for a Week 10 showdown with Rogers that likely determines the conference’s final playoff position. \nRogers High at FORT SMITH NORTHSIDE (14): Homecoming at Northside. Northside linebacker DeAndre Hardwick, on the Farm Bureau Awards watch list for 7A/6A Defensive Player of the Year, recovered two fumbles last Friday, scooping and scoring with one. Rogers plays at Springdale in Week 10 with a playoff berth likely on the line. \nFORT SMITH SOUTHSIDE (28) at Rogers Heritage: Southside ran for 210 yards and QB Cooper Johnson passed for 209 yards and two TDs, including five completions for 116 yards and two TDs to Randy Rainwater, in last week’s 35-13 win over Rogers.

The undefeated Bulldogs clobbered Conway 56-19 last week, piling up 232 yards in the first quarter. Junior quarterback Luke Hales completed 11 of 14 passes for 300 yards and four TDs.

Greenbrier senior QB Harold Ross passed for 215 yards and three TDs at Maumelle, including the game-winner in the final four minutes.
