Wehrly said in a statement. \nSpeculation about Odom’s condition has varied, but TMZ reported late Tuesday that Odom is in a coma and “fighting for his life” with ex-wife Khloe Kardashian at his side. \nWhile Bryant and Kupchak were missing following the Lakers’ 107-100 loss to the Sacramento Kings, plenty of Lakers did offer up their thoughts and prayers on Odom. Metta World Peace , a teammate with Odom on the Lakers championship teams, found it difficult to muster many words when speaking with reporters. \n“There’s nothing I can say. I don’t even know what to say,” said World Peace, who grew up with Odom in the New York City area before playing with him in purple and gold from 2009 to 2011. “There’s not one word I can say right now that would make sense.” \nThe Lakers franchise had yet to officially comment on Odom as of early Wednesday morning, but coach Byron Scott told reporters after Tuesday’s game, “Our heart and thoughts and prayers are with Lamar and his family and I wish him all the best That’s obviously something you don’t want to hear before the game.” \nAccording to the Los Angeles Daily News , “before and after the game, various team employees tried to get more information on Odom’s whereabouts,” and Scott did not discuss Odom with his players because he “didn’t think it was an appropriate time to do it before the game.” \nBut the Daily News added that longtime Lakers trainer Gary Vitti did update players on Odom’s condition as he learned information. \n“(Vitti) told us pretty much everything that’s been going on and how Lamar was, and how he thought the Lakers were his family,” Lakers swingman Nick Young told the DN. “He told us a story about how many people he lost in his life and friends. It’s sad. I don’t know how anybody can deal with that.” \nAmong the losses in Odom’s life are his mother Cathy Mercer, who died of cancer when Odom was 12; his grandmother Mildred Mercer, who raised him following his mother’s death and died in 2004; and his son Jayden, who died of SIDS at six months old in 2006. Odom was also the passenger in a car that struck and killed a 15-year-old on a bike in 2011. \nOther current and former players and other members of the NBA community offered their thoughts and prayers for Odom on Twitter. true", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:49:17.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
