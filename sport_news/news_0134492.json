Unfortunately it was not a very attractive game.\" \nThere were no such excuses for Louis van Gaal's United, although they came closest to scoring when Anthony Martial teed up substitute Jesse Lingard to volley against the bar late on. \n\"I am proud of my players. They have been concentrating and focused for 90 minutes,\" van Gaal said. \n\"We didn't create much but City adapted their line-up to our line-up. It was tough.\" \nKlopp's wait for his maiden Liverpool win goes on as Sadio Mane's late equaliser earned Southampton a deserved draw at Anfield. \nKlopp had looked set to break his duck when substitute Christian Benteke powered in a header from James Milner's cross with 13 minutes to play. \nBut Liverpool, who had drawn each of their new manager's first two matches in charge, were held once again as Mane bundled in his fifth goal in five matches with four minutes remaining. \nSenegal winger Mane was then sent off late on after receiving two yellow cards in quick succession, the second of which was for a crunching challenge on Alberto Moreno. \nAt the Stadium of Light, Sunderland swept to a record sixth successive Premier League triumph over hated neighbours Newcastle United as Fabricio Coloccini's controversial dismissal proved the turning point in the hosts' 3-0 win. \nNewcastle had more than one reason to be aggrieved over the incident that shaped the outcome. \nIt came from a penalty awarded in first-half stoppage time when Newcastle defender Coloccini blocked Steven Fletcher as the Sunderland striker tried to reach a through ball. \nWhether referee Robert Madley was right to award the spot-kick converted by Adam Johnson was highly debatable, but the red card shown to the centre-back by referee Robert Madley was certainly harsh since goalkeeper Rob Elliot looked certain to reach the ball ahead of Fletcher. \n\n- Double whammy - \n\nBilly Jones and Fletcher added further goals for Sunderland in the second half to ensure that Sam Allardyce would be their fourth successive manager to win this derby in his second match in charge. \nAnd to make the derby success even sweeter for Sunderland's players and fans, their first league win of the season lifted them above Newcastle on goal difference, although both remain in the relegation zone. \n\"This was quite an achievement considering the low ebb we're in at the moment,\" Allardyce said. \nNewcastle boss Steve McClaren added: \"It was never a penalty. Absolutely ridiculous.\" \nElsewhere, Harry Kane ended his goal drought in spectacular fashion as the Tottenham Hotspur striker's hat-trick inspired a 5-1 demolition of Bournemouth. \nKane had scored only once in his last 11 games for Tottenham and England and had just a solitary club goal to his name this season. \nMauricio Pochettino's side had actually fallen behind after just 49 seconds to Matt Ritchie's strike. \nBut Kane led the fightback, equalising with a penalty before goals from Mousa Dembele and Erik Lamela put Tottenham in control prior to half-time. \nKane struck twice in seven minutes in the second half to confirm his return to form, lifting Tottenham to sixth place and leaving Bournemouth hovering just above the relegation zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:13:10.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
