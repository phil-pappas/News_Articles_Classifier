Poythress is just 90 rebounds shy of becoming the 52nd player in program history to snatch 500 or more career boards. He’s also on pace to become the 61st player in school history to top 1,000 career points. He will enter his senior season with 649 career points.Ulis earned All-Southeastern Conference Freshman Team recognition and appeared in 37 games during UK’s historic 2014-15 38-1 season. The Lima, Ohio native led the Wildcats in assists in 20 contests, while posting five or more assists in 12 games. He did not commit a turnover in any of UK’s final four games of the season during the NCAA Tournament run. He concluded his freshman campaign ranking third in the country and first among league competition for his 3.6 assist-to-turnover ratio. Both lists will be narrowed down to 10 in mid-February and then five finalists will be selected in March. The winners of the awards will be presented at the second annual ESPN College Basketball Awards Show in Los Angeles on April 8. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
