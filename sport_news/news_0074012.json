The No. 9 Rams, meanwhile, were looking to start one. Sparked by senior running back Jake Benjamin's two touchdown rushes and solid team defense, the Chieftains basically prevented Shepherd Hill from getting anything started, building an 18-point lead by the half in a 27-10 victory at the Chieftains' rain-swept gridiron. Nashoba, which never trailed, improved to 4-0. The Rams slipped to 0-4. The Chieftains took control with a well-played first quarter that resulted in a 13-3 lead. Nashoba expanded that advantage to 21-3 by intermission. The Chieftains' first TD followed a defensive stop that led to a Shepherd Hill punt. Junior Nate Mansour took center stage, returning the punt 80 yards for a TD. Senior kicker Jonny Gjeltema kicked the extra point. The Rams closed to 7-3 on their next possession when junior kicker Jacob Tondel kicked a 31-yard field goal. Nashoba came right back, scoring the TD that proved decisive on its next possession. Benjamin capped five-play, 65-yard drive with a 5-yard burst up the middle. Senior Adam Chiodo had a big play in the drive when he caught a pass from senior quarterback Robby Atwood and motored 49 yards to the Shepherd Hill 14-yard line. Nashoba missed the point-after boot. \"We're confident right now, we've played together as a group for a while, and I think we've gotten a little bit better each week,\" Nashoba coach Jamie Tucker said. \"I'm really proud of this group. We're coming together and playing great.\" \"This is definitely a big win for our football program,\" Tucker added. \"That's a good football team. They're big, strong and have very good players. But again, I'm very proud of our guys. We're improving each week against tough competition.\" The Chieftains increased their lead to 21-3 in the second quarter when Chiodo hauled in a 40-yard pass from Atwood and scurried into the Rams' end zone. The TD put the finishing touch on a five-play, 75-yard drive. Junior running back Nick Rodgers ran in the 2-point conversion. Benjamin scored his second TD in the fourth quarter when he broke free for an 18-yard score. The Chieftains came up short on the point-after kick. Shepherd Hill scored its only TD late in the game when junior quarterback Ryan Wong-Li tossed a 5-yard TD to senior running back Nick Ostrowski, Tondel kicked the extra point. The Rams failed to score in the third quarter, despite driving to the Nashoba 8-yard line on their first possession of the half. Wong-Li had two first down rushes in the drive, which commenced at the Shepherd Hill 49.
