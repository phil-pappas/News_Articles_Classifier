And then the 49ers fired one of the best coaching staffs in the NFL. And then they lost several key players. \nBut when York had his chance to reconstruct the message to something more accurate, give his fan base a vision that would hold up over the season, he leaned on empty platitudes. \nSuper Bowl or bust. \nWin with class. \nHold me accountable. \nAnd after another embarrassing loss, when the 49ers were completely outclassed by their hated rivals, they are still continuing this charade that they are a good team if they can somehow just get it together. \nThe good leaders don't lie to themselves or their teams. They can properly assess where the teams are and put together a plan to move forward. And even if they aren't straight up about it with the fan base and media -- and many good ones have been -- the leaders make sure the inner circle is in sync. \nYet, two weeks ago, it was Colin Kaepernick, with a straight face, saying the 49ers' goal was 12-4. Last week, after beating a terrible Baltimore squad, the whole locker room was revived as though it had figured everything out. Now, Tomsula is propping up the playoffs delusion. \nTeams with a shot at the playoffs actually have a shot at winning games against good teams. But four times over the first seven games, the 49ers took the field and really didn't stand a chance. \nThis season was never about being good but about getting better. It should have never been about matching or exceeding Jim Harbaugh. \nIt should have been about building a foundation. The emphasis should have shifted to development and improvement, starting with Tomsula's introduction. We should already be tired of the 49ers spouting clich√©s about playing the right way. \nHow much different would things be if they acknowledged they were rebuilding the moment they fired Harbaugh? What would 2-5 feel like if the talking points were patience and development? \nThe Raiders went 3-13 last year and it felt like a positive year. They've given away a couple wins this year, and it's tolerable because they've been rebuilding. \nMeanwhile, the 49ers went 8-8 and were a crumbling tower. Their 2-5 feels more like they should be demoted to the Pac-12. \nThat's because the message and mindset, shaped by the leaders of the franchise, have been a setup all along. And those leaders clearly still haven't been humbled enough to accept the truth. Read Marcus Thompson II's blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/thompson . Contact him at mthomps2@bayareanewsgroup.com .
