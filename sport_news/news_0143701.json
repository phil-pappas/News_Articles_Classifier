The interim president of the Canadian Olympic Committee says the organization's board did not know of harassment complaints against former president Aubut. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson \nInterim president Tricia Smith told reporters on a conference call Tuesday the COC board was \"not aware of any specific interactions that would be construed as harassment.\"\nBut the lawyer and four-time Olympic rower, who has been a COC vice-president since 2009, was repeatedly asked if the board turned a blind eye to Aubut's behaviour.\nLa Presse and the Globe and Mail both reported a letter written to Aubut in 2011 indicated high-ranking people in the organization were uncomfortable with Aubut's conduct towards women.\nSmith insisted the board did not know about the letter, but also said an independent body has been asked to \"look into the circumstances of the June 2011, letter to understand what happened, what steps were taken and why.\"\nAn employee lodged a harassment complaint with the COC, but withdrew it with Aubut's resignation. Smith says the COC is fielding no other official complaints at this time, but other women have given interviews to Quebec media accusing Aubut of sexually harassing them.\nOne of them was Montreal lawyer Amelia Salehabadi-Fouques, who is on the Canadian Soccer Association's board.\nNone of the allegations have been proven in court and there is no criminal investigation of Aubut.\nAubut apologized to \"those who may have been offended by my behaviour\" in a statement announcing his resignation Saturday.\n\"I realize that my attitude could at times be perceived as questionable by some women and could have caused them to feel uncomfortable,\" he said. \"I acknowledge this and will adjust my behaviour accordingly.\"\nThe COC is among the most powerful sports organizations in the country with influence over dozens of Olympians and their coaches and national sport federations. It boasts millions of dollars in corporate sponsorships.\nWith the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro less than a year away, the COC has a job to do restoring its reputation and athletes' confidence in it, particularly because Aubut stamped his personality so heavily on the Olympic movement in Canada.\n\"These things should never have happened,\" Smith said. \"We hold ourselves to a high standard at the COC, but when events like this occur, it becomes obvious we can do better.\"\n\"Whatever the cause, or whoever the reason, we all have to own this.\"\nThe COC has hired Toronto employment lawyer and human resource expert Christine Thomlinson to conduct an internal review of existing policies and make recommendations for improvement, Smith said.\n\"One particular challenge will be to ensure any victim of harassment, sexual or otherwise, can feel comfortable coming forward with the complaint if they feel mistreated,\" she said. \"We want to make it as easy as possible for people to be heard.\"\nThomlinson will report to the COC board, said Smith, who \"will make the conclusions and recommendations public.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:26:39.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
