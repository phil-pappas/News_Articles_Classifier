Touchdown runs at the 10:06 mark of the first quarter and the 9:06 mark of the second frame gave Waverly a 14-0 lead. A six-yard touchdown run by Pioneer running back Darin Sornson reduced the lead to 14-6. An interception halted a promising late first half drive for Nebraska City and the score remained 14-6 at half. Nebraska City launched a 79-yard touchdown drive on its first possession of the second half with Sornson capping the march on a seven yard run. A two-point play failed and Nebraska City trailed 14-12. A Waverly kick return put the Vikings in Pioneer territory at the 34-yard line and a touchdown rush and point after made the score 21-12 in favor of the visitors. Nebraska City’s next drive featured a 35-yard 4th down pass from the Pioneer punter, Sornson, to Taner Holland. Unfortunately, the drive stalled and the Pioneers turned the ball over on downs. An interception by Trey Denniston, his second of the game, set up a 53-yard Pioneer scoring march that ended on a 24-yard touchdown run by Noah Kasbohm. A Jake Kreifel point after kick had the Pioneers down 21-19. Waverly responded with a 87-yard touchdown pass and point after to lead 28-19. Nebraska City took the ball over with 7:24 to go in the game and hit on a 60-yard pass from Kasbohm to Denniston. The point after missed and Waverly led 28-25. Waverly looked to be driving the field, killing the clock and setting up a game-winning score, but the Pioneers had other ideas. The home team’s defense forced a fumble and Nebraska City began a scoring march. Kasbohm hit on passes to Andrew Connell and Austin Betts before throwing a touchdown pass to Sornson. A Kreifel point after had Nebraska City ahead 32-28 with 51.2 seconds remaining. Waverly’s 44-yard touchdown pass with 18 seconds left came on a play where, for a moment, it appeared Nebraska City would intercept the ball. A point after made the score 35-32 in favor of Waverly. A last second throw down field by Nebraska City was intercepted and the Waverly offense ran the final two seconds off the clock to end the game and ensure their victory. Nebraska City, 2-5, will play next week at Plattsmouth.
