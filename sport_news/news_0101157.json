Cincinnati (4-0) matched the third-best start in franchise history, two wins shy of the club record. ... Green Bay has its first 4-0 start since winning the initial 13 games in 2011.\n___\nSTREAKS & STATS\nThe New York Jets had 207 yards rushing in their 27-14 win over the Miami Dolphins in London.

It was the first time the Jets played in the NFL's International Series, the third time for the Dolphins. Miami lost the first game in 2007, 13-10 to the New York Giants. Last year, the Dolphins beat the Oakland Raiders 38-14.\n___\nDIVISION DOMINANCE\nIndianapolis defeated Jacksonville 16-13 in overtime, giving the Colts their 15th consecutive division victory — which ties the 1972-73 Miami Dolphins for the longest streak since 1970. Indianapolis' active win streak against AFC South opponents began on December 30, 2012, when the Colts earned a 28-16 win against Houston. The Colts can break the record Thursday night at Houston.\n___\nCOMEBACK COUSINS\nKirk Cousins capped a 90-yard drive with a go-ahead, 4-yard TD toss to Pierre Garcon with 26 seconds left Sunday, lifting the Redskins past the Philadelphia Eagles 23-20.\nCousins finished 31 for 46 for 290 yards, the one TD — and, most importantly for a guy with a pair of two-interception games already this season, no turnovers. He did fumble a snap in the first half at Philadelphia's 1, but recovered it and plunged forward for a touchdown, with the help of a push from running back Matt Jones.\n___\nDISGRUNTLED DEMARCO\nPhiladelphia's DeMarco Murray, who missed last week's victory over the Jets with a leg injury, gained just 36 yards on eight carries in the Eagles' 23-20 loss at Washington and voiced disappointment with the way he's being used by coach Chip Kelly. After leading the NFL in rushing last season for Dallas, Murray joined Philadelphia as a free agent, and has 47 yards on 29 carries so far.\n___\nNOT SO FAST\nSan Diego's Josh Lambo kicked a 34-yard field goal to win it with 2 seconds left, moments after getting another chance when Cleveland was offside on his 39-yard attempt in a 30-27 victory. Lambo was wide right as the Browns jumped up and down, thinking they'd forced overtime. But Cleveland's Tramon Williams was whistled for offside, giving Lambo another chance.\n___\nSIDELINED\nPlaying at Wembley Stadium, Miami lost top cornerback Brent Grimes to a knee injury in the first quarter of the Dolphins' 27-14 loss to the Jets. ... New York lost strong safety Calvin Pryor in the fourth quarter, also to a knee injury. Linebacker David Harris hurt a quadriceps muscle in the fourth quarter, and running back Bilal Powell hurt a groin muscle in the second quarter and didn't return. Jets rookie defensive lineman Leonard Williams also sprained an ankle late in the game. ... St. Louis inside linebacker Alec Ogletree, who was carted off the field with just over five minutes left in the third quarter in Arizona, will need surgery on his injured ankle. ... The Chicago Bears got Jay Cutler back from an injured hamstring Sunday, but they lost center Will Montgomery on the opening possession with a broken leg. ... Dallas LB Sean Lee sustained a concussion at New Orleans. Lance Dunbar, who'd rushed for 54 yards in the first half, had to be helped off the field with a knee injury after returning the kickoff to open the second half.\n___\nSPEAKING\n\"Just seeing the ball pop up like a greased pig, nobody really panicked because Ed picked it up mid-stride. We've just got to work on him taking that car out of neutral when he's running.\" — Carolina's Cam Newton on 255-pound tight end Ed Dickson, who recovered a fumble and rumbled 57 yards for a TD in the Panthers' 37-23 victory over Tampa Bay.\n___\n\"Thankfully I got a second chance. I missed the first one and I just started laughing. Then I saw a flag on the field and said, 'Oh, OK, let's try again.' Fortunately I had a second chance.\" — San Diego's Josh Lambo, who kicked a 34-yard field goal to win it 30-27, moments after getting another chance when Cleveland was offside on his missed 39-yard attempt with 2 seconds left.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
