Could he be the new Joe Tucci? (photo by Oracle PR, CC BY 2.0). \nWith news that Dell is looking to buy all, or some, of Hopkinton, Mass.-based data storage giant EMC, it's worth reminding everyone there was a time when Michael Dell wasn't so hot on the idea. \nIn a June 2011 feature titled \"Michael Dell's dilemma,\" Fortune magazine reported on how Dell rebuffed an effort by former CEO Kevin Rollins to acquire EMC in 2002. The feature, which was published two years before Dell bought out the company from shareholders for $24.4B, focused on the company's struggle to move beyond the PC and consumer electronics market and catch up with other players in enterprise IT. \"I couldn’t get Michael to agree. He was worried that it would be too destabilizing for the company.\" \nAt the time, Rollins' desire to buy EMC was part of his goal to expand Dell beyond the PC market. \n\"I couldn’t get Michael to agree,\" Rollins told Fortune , which marked the first time he spoke publicly about Dell since his 2007 firing. \"He was worried that it would be too destabilizing for the company.\" \nCiting interviews with four former senior executives, Fortune said Michael Dell apparently saw buying EMC as too much of a big bet back then, and that was in part because of the disappointing performance of data storage company, ConvergeNet, which it acquired in 1999. \nInstead, Dell went in the opposite direction, expanding the company into the consumer goods market, with MP3 players, printers and televisions — a direction we all know didn't work out. \nFast forward 13 years later and Dell has evolved into a company that is barely in the consumer market anymore, with revenue reportedly split between 85 percent enterprise and commercial and 15 percent consumer, as of last year. As the Wall Street Journal reported , the company's acquisition of EMC would bring it even further into the B2B world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:57:25.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
