It was exciting. It felt really good, but it just one game.\"\nThe loss was the third straight for the Rangers, who opened the season with three wins.\n\"I think we need to be concerned,\" Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi said. \"We're not pressing any panic button by any means but it needs to be addressed right now.\"\nThe overtime was wild. Devils defenseman Andy Greene reached behind goaltender Cory Schneider in the opening 23 seconds and pulled Rick Nash's shot off the goal line before it went across.\nLundqvist stole one from the Devils with 2:35 left in the extra session, coming across the crease to stop Kyle Palmieri on his doorstep. Greene set up the shot with a great pass.\n\"I felt like the game was right there for us,\" said Lundqvist, who had 22 saves. \"We had some opportunities late in the game but couldn't cash in.\"\nThe Devils had a great chance to take the lead early in the third period when they had a two-man advantage for 1:36 after defenseman Kevin Klein was called for delay of game on a penalty kill. However, the Rangers did not allow a shot.\nAfter being shut out by the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday night, the Rangers scored early. Rookie Oscar Lindberg picked up a loose puck at center ice, skated it into the New Jersey zone and found Stepan alone in front. The center cut across the crease and slipped a backhand between Schneider's pads at 3:12.\nSchneider stopped Stepan in the slot minutes later and Devils defensive Damon Severson prevented Kevin Hayes from sliding a puck into an open net with a sliding block with his leg.\nNew Jersey, which may not have had a quality chance in the first period, tied the game 1:52 into the second period when Henrique stuffed his own rebound past Lundqvist. It was his team-high third goal of the season.\nNOTES: The Devils scratched RW Tuomo Ruutu with an undisclosed injury. ... Backup G Antti Raanta is still waiting to make his first regular-season appearance with the Rangers. ... Klein got the best of Palmieri in a late first-period fight. ... Stepan has 11 goals against New Jersey, the most he has scored against any team. ... New York has outscored its opponents 9-2 in the first period this season. ...The Devils lost all four games to the Rangers last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:26:46.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
