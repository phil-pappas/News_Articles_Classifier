His diagnosis absolutely floored me and I just felt like we had to do something for one of our own.” \nVaschak, a 1972 Campbell Memorial graduate who recently retired after 37 years in education, was working lunch duty at his alma mater when he felt as if something just wasn’t right. \nThat was Sept. 10, a day that he said he will never forget. \n“I didn’t feel well so I told our assistant principal, Brad Yeager. The next thing I know they tell me I’ve had two seizures and I’m at St. Elizabeth Hospital on Belmont Avenue,” he said. “Then, I’m at the Cleveland Clinic and they’re running every test imaginable. I just cannot thank everyone enough for all of the care that they have administered thus far.” \nVaschak is currently undergoing six weeks of extensive treatment, receiving chemotherapy pills once a day and radiation five days a week at the Cleveland Clinic. \nHe credits his wife, Jennifer, as being his rock throughout his officiating career and now this illness, while his colleagues are all pulling for his quick return to the field and court. \n“Mike is the ultimate partner as he is 100-percent professional and someone who always had your back. There’s a reason ‘Vaz’ was selected to go to the state so many times,” former Gateway Conference football official Brian Meenachan said. “We worked basketball games for over 30 years and when he was one of your partners, you just knew that he was going to handle whatever might come up that night. He was a stickler for the rules and always gave both teams a fair chance to win based on the OHSAA rules.” \nRob Luklan, a former Big Ten Conference and current Atlantic Coast Conference football official, called Vaschak one of the best officials in the Mahoning Valley. \n“Having known Mike for over 30 years and officiated with him for 25 years, it didn’t take me long to realize that he always put everyone else’s needs before his. He’s a fighter and this is a battle that I just know he is going to win,” Luklan said. \nFor Mang, to have a referee with impeccable character was very important to his organization. \n“Mike had your back in any game that he ever officiated. He was like that from the first game he ever officiated until now,” Mang said. “Not only is he a great official, but he’s an even better husband, father and person.” \nA donation of $2 is suggested upon entrance with game time slated for 7 p.m. Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:44:11.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
