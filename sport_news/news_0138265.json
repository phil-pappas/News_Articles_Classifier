This year's Bobcats are looking to become the best football team in school history. \n\nNortheastern is a relatively young football program only dating back to 2008. The Bobcats' best year so far was in 2012 where they closed out the regular season at 7-3. They are currently 6-1 and with three more games left in the season, they're hoping to break that record. \n\n\"Sooner or later it was going to be a break out year,\" explains Northeastern head football coach, Jon Scepanski. \"These kids are definitely the group that deserves it.\" \n\nEvidence of this team's success doesn't just show on their record, but also in the stands. \n\n\"The community knows about the football team and we're excited to have it,\" said Northeastern running back, Kody Resser. \"They rally behind us and it really helps us on Friday nights\".\" \n\nNortheastern will take on Spring Grove Friday night. Kick off is set for 7 pm. Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:01:04.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
