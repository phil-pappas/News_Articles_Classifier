Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. There is only one play that senior quarterback Travis Rodgers wants to call tonight against the Sonora Wildcats. King-13. When Rodgers gets the word from offensive coordinator Mike Oliva to call king-13, Summerville will line up in the victory formation and take a knee to run out the clock for the win. King-13. It will not be easy to get that final play called. Summerville is coming off a tough 29-28 loss to Bret Harte in Angels Camp. Sonora is riding a five-game winning streak. And if history is any indication, the deck is stacked against Summerville because the Bears have never beaten the ‘Cats on the gridiron. First year head coach Sean Leveroos will try to accomplish what legendary Summerville coaches Darcy Wingo, Dave Woods, and Ben Watson were unable to do — beat Sonora. “Everyone asks the same question whether it’s their first Sonora game or the last Sonora game, which is ‘Do you think you have a chance to beat Sonora?’ That is the same question that has been asked from when I played here as a junior, to the last couple of years,” Leveroos said. “Do you think you have a chance? When there was a chance that they were coming into the league, it’s the same question.” The Summerville coaches know about the history between Sonora and Summerville. They know what it is like to go toe-to-toe with their crosstown foes and get beat. Perhaps one of the greatest Summerville teams ever assembled (1991 8-1 Mother Lode League champions) which had coaches Ryan Wynne and 1991 MLL defensive player of the year Mike Brennan, fell to Sonora 28-8. History tends to repeat itself. Well, the 2015 Bears are looking to change history. All week, the team had one battle cry. One motto that has fueled them to play the best game of their lives. One saying that they all believe with every fiber of their being. “Never, until now.” This Summerville team believes that it has what it takes to finally break through against Sonora. The Bears started to believe early in June. “It started in the summer, back when we went into our first individual drill,” Leveroos said. “We have a progression which is A.S.K.R which is alignment, stance, keys and responsibility. No matter who we play, we believe that if we align right, we get in the right stance, we read our keys and we do our responsibilities, we will put our kids in a position to succeed. So, we harp back on the fundamentals and the basics and trust what you have been taught to do.” Summerville wants to control the line of scrimmage and run the ball. Sonora has one of the toughest front sevens in the Sac-Joaquin Section, so the Bears will need an amazing performance from their offensive front five. “It’s all about getting a good push on the line,” said lineman Tristan Hudson. “We need to block on the inside and not let anybody through to hit our back. Their defensive line is pretty good and they have some pretty big guys. Some of them are really fast, some are really strong, so it’s going to be a good matchup.” Summerville added some beef to its backfield. With the stout Sonora front seven, Leveroos hopes the bigger backs may cause trouble for the ‘Cats defense. “We did put a couple of bigger running backs in the backfield, because as everyone knows, they are really good up front,” Leveroos said. The Bears will have a difficult time moving the ball through the air. Leading receiver JT McCready has been nursing a sore hamstring the majority of the year, and it is still unclear if he will be at 100-percent and contribute to the offense. “McCready has been a game-time decision for the past three weeks,” Leveroos said. “Of course, the player tells me that he is good to go every single week. We will watch him during warmups and make a decision as to what is best for McCready.” In order to beat Sonora, the Bears will need to stop the ‘Cats rushing attack. No simple task. The Bears have been burned on the ground this season, so it is important that they don’t let the Sonora backs get second chances and extra yardage. “I just have to do what I’m told, keep cage, and come up and attack against the receivers trying to block me,” said junior cornerback Jeremy Ortmann. “I need to be able to tackle and make plays. To make a tackle I need to get low and turn them in so the linebackers can help make the play. I have to keep on my reads and make sure I don’t get distracted by the motions that they run.” The Bears are ready. This is a game that will let everyone know what kind of football team they are. They know this is a game that could change history and start a new trend. A trend where Summerville is the team Sonora has to beat. Remember, never, until now. “This has been a great week of practice,” Leveroos said. “We didn’t have to get our kids excited. They know the magnitude of this night. There has been a lot more vocal leadership, from our seniors in particular. I believe that this has been a week where we can get back to where we can get back to being normal with all the abnormalities that have taken place.” Tickets sales As of Thursday morning, between tickets sold at Summerville and Sonora, the number is close to 1,000, according to Summerville athletic director Debbie Mager. “Our office said the sales today were steady, but not crazy,” Mager said. “So, I am sure we will have a good number of tickets left to sell.” The remainder of the tickets will be for sale today at the game on a first come, first serve basis. The cost is $8. The Thorsted Field gates open at 4:30 p.m. “We are looking forward to a great football game,” Mager said.
