Four of the remaining teams were area champions, while Sequoyah (23-14) was a No. 2 seed.Kelley Hartman had a big night for the Lady Chiefs (23-14), recording 16 kills. Lauren Hartman and Deja Gross each had seven, while Marcelle Butler added six. Setting up those kill opportunities was Annika Lanning with 32 assists.Defensively, Mallory Lawson led Sequoyah with six digs, while Lanning and Kelley Hartman tied for the team lead with three blocks each.“I think we played really well,” coach John Edwards said in a telephone interview. “Once we figured out what (Glynn Academy was) trying to do, we settled in nicely. I was really pleased with our communication. You could see them taking what we talked about in the huddle onto the court. That’s a good sign.”After cruising to a win in the first set, the match was much closer, with Glynn Academy (33-21) holding leads early in the second and third sets.“Our passes got a little sloppier, and it showed in the second and third sets,” Edwards said. “I really liked how we responded, though, especially in the middle. To come back from behind and not let them see the lead again was big. It says a lot about this team.”Sequoyah enjoyed a significant home-court advantage in a straight-sets win over Northside Columbus in the first round, but it had the opposite feeling Tuesday.“It was different, for sure,” Edwards said. “We left Monday and stayed on Jekyll Island. We had to remind ourselves that we weren’t on a vacation. We were here to take care of business, and I think we did that.”Edwards said a big reason his team was able to handle the road trip was the players’ maturity and experience, something he said should help them the rest of the way.“This team has been to the last two finals, and that definitely helps us,” Edwards said. “These girls know how we have to play to get the job done, but they also know it takes more than that. They’ve been there and been successful there, so I know, no matter who we have to play or where we have to play them, we’ll be ready.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:47:03.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
