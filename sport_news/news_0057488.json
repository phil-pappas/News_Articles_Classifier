Reuters/Danish Siddiqui - 4 of 4 right \nMUMBAI Quinton de Kock, Faf de Plessis and AB de Villiers all scored blistering hundreds as South Africa crushed India's bowling attack to post 438 for four wickets in their 50 overs in the deciding one-day international at the Wankhede Stadium. \nWith the five-match series tied at 2-2, de Villiers won the toss and opted to bat in hot and humid conditions and could not have been a happier man at the close of their innings as his team matched their second highest score in the 50-over format. \nIt was only the second time that a team had scored three centuries in an ODI innings after South Africa did it against West Indies in January this year on their way to their highest total of 439 for two. \nDe Kock (109) continued to make merry against the Indian bowlers, scoring his fifth century in nine innings against the opponents after South Africa had lost Hashim Amla (23) early. \nThe left-hander hit 17 fours and a six on his way to his eighth ODI hundred and laid the perfect platform for de Villiers' onslaught with an 154-run stand with du Plessis (133 retired hurt). \nIndia compounded their miseries by dropping catches and du Plessis made the most of his good fortune to score his first century against India and his fifth overall after being put down twice, on 45 and 85. \nThe right-handed batsman suffered severe cramps during the later part of his innings and had to retire but had added 164 runs with de Villiers for the third wicket before that. \nDe Villiers, the owner of the record for the fastest hundred in the format, needed no invitation to launch into the Indian bowlers with the stage set perfectly for his pyrotechnics. \nThe 31-year-old reached his century, his 23rd in the format, in just 57 balls and cleared the boundary ropes with ease. The right-hander hit 11 sixes and three fours in his knock. \nIndia medium paceman Bhuvnehwar Kumar ended with figures of 1-106 in his 10 overs, the second most expensive in ODIs behind Australian Mick Lewis's 0-113 against South Africa in 2006.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:57:29.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
