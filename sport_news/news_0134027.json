That decision stems from a scuffle with police back in April. \nSefolosha was arrested outside a New York nightclub after a stabbing. During the trial, he claimed officers got physical when he tried to offer a panhandler some money . Officers testified Sefolosha ignored their orders while they investigated the stabbing. (Video via YouTube / Kris Willis ) \nTMZ later posted a video of the Atlanta Hawks player being thrown to the ground by police officers. Sefolosha suffered a season-ending leg injury during his arrest. \nThe trial was a big win for the player who rejected a lenient plea deal. The New York Times reported prosecutors offered to dismiss charges against Sefolosha if he did a day of community service and stayed out of trouble for half a year. \nNBA Players Association Executive Director Michele Roberts praised Sefolosha's decision to go to trial Friday, tweeting , \"JUSTICE PREVAILS! THABO HAD THE COURAGE TO FIGHT THE CHARGES - WE ARE SO PROUD!\" \nAfter his acquittal, Buzzfeed reporter Lindsey Adler tweeted Sefolosha is still weighing whether to file a civil suit against the city. \nDespite the injury, Sefolosha told reporters during the Atlanta Hawks media day he feels good and hopes to be ready by opening night. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:06:17.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
