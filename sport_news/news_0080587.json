Backup quarterback Jerrard Randall. \nTrue freshman cornerback Jace Whittaker. Where did he come from? \nJack Banda. What's a Jack Banda? \nThe middle of Arizona's defense for a good long while Saturday night consisted of 247-pound nose guard Parker Zellers and too-small-to-be-ideal middle linebackers Jake Matthews and Sir Thomas Jackson, all of whom arrived on campus as walk-ons. \nThat is hardly the way you draw up a Pac-12 victory, any Pac-12 victory. \nArizona coach Rich Rodriguez told reporters Saturday night that he looked out at his defense at times against Colorado and spotted only two guys -- presumably Reggie Gilbert and Will Parks -- who were in the starting lineup when the Wildcats began the season many moons and many injuries ago. \nBut with duct tape, bubble gum and an increasing cast of \"misfit toys,\" Rodriguez and his staff MacGyver-ed a 38-31 victory at Colorado, finding a way to stop a mid-game leak that threatened to swamp the Cats' chances of doing anything in the Pac-12 South. \n\"We didn't execute in any phase really,\" Rodriguez said on his postgame radio show. \"But sometimes you've got to win when you don't play your best.\" \nThe Wildcats are still without All-American linebacker Scooby Wright. Their second-best linebacker, Derrick Turituri, remains out. Arizona suspended defensive tackle Anthony Fotu for the rest for the rest of the season, Rodriguez told reporters Saturday night. \nFor the second game, Arizona played without its best cornerback, injured DaVonte' Neal, other than being on the \"hands team\" for Colorado's late on-side kick. For reasons unknown, potential starting cornerback Jarvis McCall didn't see the field until the second half, and then, not much, at that. \nAlso for reasons unknown, true freshman running back Orlando Bradford -- praised all week after his effort against Oregon State -- didn't take have a carry, despite the absence of starter Nick Wilson, suffering from a foot injury. \nStarting safety Tellas Jones left the game in the first half because of injury and didn't return. \nQuarterback Anu Solomon was \"off a little bit,\" Rodriguez said. \nAnd you're telling us the Wildcats won? \nAfter scoring 17 points on their first three possessions, the Wildcats got nothing on their next eight drives. They turned the ball over when a snap bounced off Solomon's face mask. They turned the ball over on a punt return when the ball hit Trey Griffey while blocking. Arizona failed to down a punt inside the 5 when Jonathan Haden backed himself into the end zone before securing the ball. \nRodriguez's blood pressure must have been as high as the elevation in Boulder. \nBut there's nothing in the playbook that says you have to look good while winning. \nBaker burst through the middle of the line for touchdown runs of 79 and 45 yards, the latter coming early in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 24 after the Wildcats had been held off the scoreboard for those eight consecutive drives. \n\"Jared is a fast guy,\" Rodriguez said. \"When we give him a little bit of a crease, he's able to take advantage of it.\" \nBaker finished with 23 carries for 207 yards, but it was Randall who lit the fuse to the offense, subbing for Solomon late in the third quarter. Randall directed touchdown drives of 97 and 94 yards as Arizona regained the lead, and scored on a 1-yard run on his third possession. \nThrough the middle of the game, the Arizona offense looked like the stagnated attack from the second half of last season, when Solomon was no threat to run because of an ankle injury. Maybe because Solomon is coming off a recent concussion, but there was virtually no hint of the QB run game against Colorado, which tilts the numbers advantage to the defense. \nRunnin' Randall flipped the script. \nAs Rodriguez said, the defense has to account for all 11 players on offense when Randall is in the game. With Solomon not running, the defense didn't have to account for him. \n\"The way they were playing us, it kind of fit Jerrard's skill set a little bit and help our run game get going,\" Rodriguez said. \nRandall rushed 11 times for 81 yards. He had to come out for one play, and Solomon popped back in and hit Baker on a 25-yard scoring pass. \nMeanwhile, the defense hung in there. Colorado picked on Whittaker quite a bit, which is how he ended up with 11 tackles. Banda, a 228-pound redshirt sophomore in his first extended playing time, had two sacks. Matthews made 11 stops. Sir T had five, including one for loss. \n\"We're banged up everywhere, like most teams are, and whoever goes in has to make something happen,\" Rodriguez said. \nSo, the resourceful Wildcats get to move on to the next one with a 5-2 record, 2-2 in the Pac-12. They are tied with ASU and are a half-game ahead of USC and UCLA. That scenario would normally be cause for celebration, except for the fact that Utah is 3-0 in the league. \nArizona will get its shot at the Utes next month. \nThis week, the Cats return home to face Washington State and its Air Raid attack that is fourth nationally in passing (398.5 yards per game). \nPerhaps Coach MacGyver can use a toothpick, a potato and a former manager for the women's soccer team -- hey, the Wildcats have one of those in kicker Casey Skowron -- to slow down the Cougars. \nHe's done as much with less. \n* * * \nAnthony Gimino has covered University of Arizona athletics for more than two decades, including as the football beat writer for the Arizona Daily Star and the columnist for the Tucson Citizen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:42:15.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
