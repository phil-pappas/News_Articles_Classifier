Patil admitted the constant changing of Ajinkya Rahane’s batting position is a matter of concern, but the ultimate decision of the playing XI rests with the skipper and the coach, in this case Team Director Ravi Shastri. “Our jurisdiction is to give the captain a team which he wants. The final selection of the XI is always left to the captain and the team management. That’s why earlier when I was asked if we have discussed this issue, yes we have discussed this issue. We were worried about a few things. I hope things will work better hereafter,” Patil said. “We have not only discussed about Rahane, but the other players as well with the captain. We have had a word with the Director also. We (selectors) have certain limitations. We have no complaints, but yes we have limitations. We discuss and we agree to a conclusion, and finally decide the combination of 15 players. But, it is always left to them to pick the playing XI, the batting and the bowling order,” Patil added. The Indian team’s middle-order woes have a lot to do with how Rahane has been utilised in the last few series and Dhoni’s sudden urge to bat at No. 4 in the 50-over format. The team had a settled look with Rahane following Kohli at No. 4, and Dhoni coming down at No. 6 after Suresh Raina. But, whenever Dhoni elevates himself to No. 4, the team combination gets disturbed. Also, while Rahane struggled to find a place in the playing XI in the Bangladesh series, he was given the captaincy for the ODIs and T20Is against Zimbabwe. Against South Africa, he was first made to sit out in the T20I series and was then forced to juggle between the No. 3 and No. 6 positions. In the first two ODIs, he played at No. 3, with Kohli having to move down to No. 4, and scored 60 and 51, respectively. But in the ODI at Rajkot, the Mumbai batsman was again moved down by Dhoni, keeping in mind the mounting asking rate during the 271-run chase. “It’s not about whether I am satisfied or if we are satisfied with the way Rahane is being handled. It’s the captain and the team management’s call. But yes, we have suggested a few things, and I believe, they will give a good thought to it,” Patil said. Patil also expressed concerns about the team’s performance against the Proteas — the hosts are trailing 1-2 in the ODI series after having lost the T20I series 0-2. “We are concerned. The two selectors with the Indian team had a word with the management and the captain. Today also, we had a detailed discussion with the captain. The areas we felt that needed looking into have been discussed.” Jadeja in, Bhajji out\nThe selectors picked the squad for the last two ODIs and the first two Tests, which saw the comeback of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja in the longer format after a hiatus of nearly 14 months. Jadeja, who was dropped for the tours of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, has replaced Harbhajan Singh. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who suffered a side strain in the first ODI in Kanpur, has been included in the 16-man Test squad but not picked up for the last two ODIs. Seamer Sreenath Aravind has replaced Umesh Yadav in the ODI squad. Jadeja has been included on the basis of his impressive showing after three rounds of the Ranji Trophy — with 24 wickets in two matches. He has also scored two half-centuries — 91 and 58 — for Saurashtra. Ishant Sharma has been named in the Test squad and he will return for the second Test in Bengaluru after serving a one-match ban for bad behaviour during India’s tour of Sri Lanka.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:22:19.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
