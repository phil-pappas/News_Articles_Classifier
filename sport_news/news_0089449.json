And right now, three games into their preseason, the Clippers already have some bad habits to break.\nPlaying the first NBA game ever in Shenzhen, China on Sunday, the Clippers turned in another clunker, losing 106-94 to the Charlotte Hornets.\nâI thought Charlotte played so much harder than us with a better spirit,â Clippers coach Doc Rivers told the Chinese media. âThatâs going to take us time. Itâs a work in progress.â\nThe Clippers have been handily outplayed in each of their past two games, losing by 20 to Toronto in Vancouver before heading to China.\nAnd even though J.J. Redick got hot early Sunday, scoring 16 of his 23 points in the first quarter against the Hornets, the big picture needs to be addressed, he said.\nâItâs not about me. I want our team to play well,â he said. âI think the biggest adjustment we have to make after the last two games is we have to play harder.â\nSunday, it was obvious the defensive effort wasnât where it needed to be.\nThe Hornets scored 37 points in the first quarter, operating without much restriction. And the Clippers offense, which was the leagueâs most efficient a year ago, sputtered throughout the second half.\nThe team will get one more on their international tour, getting another crack at the Hornets on Wednesday in Shanghai before returning back to Los Angeles for their final two preseason games.\nNotes\nEven with the Clippersâ problems, Blake Griffin nearly notched a triple-double Sunday, finishing with 13 points, 10 assists and 9 rebounds. â¦The bench, which has struggled taking care of the basketball, committed nine of the teamâs 14 turnovers in their loss. Paul Pierce was responsible for two of them â\" one less than the points he scored. â¦ Former Clipper Spencer Hawes made his first 3-point shot of the game and finished with 10 points and 13 rebounds in just 25 minutes. Hawes failed to record a double-double for the Clippers last season. â¦Despite breaking a bone in his left index finger, Chris Paul hasnât been ruled out of playing in the teamâs Chinese finale Wednesday. Austin Rivers (mouth trauma) likely will sit the game out. With no Paul and no Rivers on Sunday, Pablo Prigioni started at point guard for the Clippers.\nContact the writer: dwoike@ocregister.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-clippers.logo.2010.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-clippers.logo.2010.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:54:48.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
