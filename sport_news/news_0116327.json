The Kansas City Royals lead the series 3-1.\nToday's score: 1-0 Toronto\nTweets from https://twitter.com/arikligeti/lists/jays-globe\nWhat you need to know:\n– It’s a rematch of Game 1’s starters, with Marco Estrada getting the start for the Blue Jays against the Royals’ Edinson Volquez.\n– Estrada threw 5 1/3 innings in Game 1, giving up three runs in the process. Volquez threw 6 innings and didn’t surrender a single run.\n– In 1985, the Royals came back from a 3-1 series deficit to beat the Blue Jays in the ALCS and advance to the World Series. Can the Blue Jays return the favour 30 years later?\n– Lefty Jays reliever Aaron Loup is unavailable again today for personal reasons. Starter (and left-hander) David Price will be available out of the bullpen.\n– We have Blue Jays Bingo .
