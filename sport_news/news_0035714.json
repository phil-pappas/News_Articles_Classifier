I thought the lines on both sides of the ball played great.\"\nDubuque broke tackles, eluded defenders and at times, carried three or four would-be tacklers on his way to 257 yards on 35 carries.\nHis 14-yard TD run with 3:29 left in the second quarter broke a scoreless tie.\n\"We had some trouble those first two drives, but we stepped up and just grounded out the first downs,\" Dubuque said. \"This was an important game for us because we want a home game in the playoffs and it was Senior Night, too.\"\nLa Salle drove the ball to the Blue Devils' 24-yard line on the ensuing possession, but the chance to even the score at the half was denied on an interception by Jake Preston .\nColumbia (4-2 overall, 3-1 Liberty Division) opened the second half by driving 62 yards for a touchdown, Dubuque running it in from nine yards out.\nAfter forcing the Cadets to punt from deep in their own territory, the Blue Devils scored again on a 38-yard drive, capped by Dubuque's four-yard TD run.\n\"Dylan had a heck of a game for us,\" Cavotta said. \"He worked hard and ran the ball with authority. The kids up front love blocking for him and our other backs.\"\nLa Salle (2-4, 2-2) got its lone score with 1:21 left in the third quarter when Kyle Borey took an option toss from quarterback Jack Field and found Bryan Miller all alone on a 42-yard touchdown pass.\n\"On defense, we planned for their trick plays and for the most part, we were disciplined and held them, except for that touchdown play,\" Dubuque said.\nColumbia answered back, scoring its final touchdown with less than a minute gone in the fourth on Jeff Simoni 's 27-yard reception from Steve Lindemann .\nLindemann completed three of six passes for 87 yards, while Simoni had two catches for 76 yards, and also had an interception.\nAmir Young had 67 yards on the ground and Joe Planz rushed for 54 yards to lead La Salle.\n\"This was a huge win for us,\" Cavotta said. \"If they had won, they would have pretty much wrapped up the No. 2 seed. Now, we go to Bethlehem next week and control our own destiny.\"\nEric Houghtaling is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:19:41.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
