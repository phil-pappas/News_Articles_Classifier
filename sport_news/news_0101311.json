They visited Lincoln Financial Field just two years ago in the 2013 playoffs.\nAfter hearing about how Eagles fans liked to egg the opposing team buses, the Saints decided to have some fun and put a giant bullseye on their bus, practically daring fans to try to hit it.\nSean Payton puts a bullseye on the @Saints team bus as a motivational trick, to counter Philly fans egging. pic.twitter.com/BzJDbGkgqG\nâ€” Katherine Fugate (@katherinefugate) January 4, 2014\nWhen they travel to Philadelphia this weekend, they're not just anticipating it, they're welcoming it.\nSaints cornerback Keenan Lewis said Eagles fans tried to hit the bullseye last time, but weren't very good with their aim. So he's inviting them to try again.\n\"I'll be kind of excited. I like to sit by the bullseye we've got on the bus and see who's got the best aim out there,\" Lewis said. \"I'm definitely excited to see it...\n\"They kinda missed last time, they hit the wrong window ... So hopefully they worked on their aim during their training camp as well.\"\nAdded safety Jairus Byrd: \"This is my first time actually going up there so I'm looking forward to seeing what they've got and what their aim is like.\"", "external_links": ["https://t.co/BzJDbGkgqG", "https://twitter.com/katherinefugate/status/419599093338349568", "https://twitter.com/Saints"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:56:57.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
