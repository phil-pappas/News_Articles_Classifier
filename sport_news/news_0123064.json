Crookston High School had runners in the varsity and JV levels, as Katherine Geist took fifth place in the varsity division, while Emily Gillette took 15th in the JV division. Geist ran the 5K in 20:12, while Gillette finished in 25:18. Here are head coach, Kristy Aune’s comments on the Crookston runners. “Katherine Geist continues to be one of the strongest runners in the area. She got out fast and pushed the pace and did not panic when the Perham and Roseau girls passed her. She knew they would come on strong and she just kept pushing herself and running her own race. Katherine was very quick and smart as she raced today; she continues to compete with her opponents and does not key herself off of them, she runs her own race. She earned an All-Conference award again this year. Emily Gillette ran the junior varsity 5000 meters in 25:18. A strong performance for her. She has been running the 3200 races most of this season and did very well moving up in distance.” By Times Report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:17:28.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
