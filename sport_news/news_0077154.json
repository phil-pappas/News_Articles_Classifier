Former New York Mets and Texas Rangers teammates Chris Young and R.A. Dickey are squaring off in this game. Knuckleballer Dickey is coming off 4 2/3rd innings of one-run ball for the Jays in Game 4 of the ALDS against Texas, while Young gave up just one run in 11 1/3 innings over his last two regular-season starts for the Royals and then one run out of the bullpen in the first game of their ALDS with Houston. \nThe third game in the National League Championship Series is being played this evening in Chicago. The Cubs hit the home turf down two games to none in the NLCS as the Mets won the first two games in New York. The pitching matchup has Jacob deGrom going for the Mets against Kyle Hendricks. DeGrom, the 2014 National League Rookie of the Year, is coming off back to back wins over two of the top pitchers in the game, Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke (GREHN’-kee) of the Dodgers. \nAfter dropping the first two games of the series the Cubs are turning to 25-year old right-hander Kyle Hendricks who won eight games in his first big-league season. It won’t be easy for New York as the Cubs have won 51 games on the home field this season and the Mets have not won at Wrigley since May 19, 2013. \nNHL-SCHEDULE \nHabs put perfect record on the line \nUNDATED (AP) — Two of the hottest teams in the NHL face off tonight in Montreal as the Canadiens play host to the Blues.

The Royal and Ancient, the organizing body of the Open, has announced that the Open in five years will be held at Royal Portrush, which served as host once before back in 1951. \nThe push to bring the Open back to Northern Ireland gained momentum after three players from the country, Graeme McDowell, Darren Clarke and Rory McIlroy, won majors since 2010.
