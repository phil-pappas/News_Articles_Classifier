The source said the damage to the middle finger is more extensive than previously thought , although the Giants think it wouldn't prevent Pierre-Paul from being able to play as long as skin grafts used to repair his hand and fingers are strong enough.\n\"If he gets back for four games, that would be good,\" the source said. \"If it's more, that would be a bonus.\"\nThe source added, however, that the team remains realistic about the possibility that a return might not happen this year if further healing doesn't take place. \"It's still possible he doesn't come back [this year],'' the source said.\nPLUS : Lawrence Taylor sounds off on JPP's status\nPierre-Paul is reportedly set to return to the Giants in the next two weeks to have his status re-evaluated , but head coach Tom Coughlin has told reporters twice over the last few days he does not know anything about Pierre-Paul's plans.\nThe report says NFL rules allow a free agent two visits with a team before signing. Pierre-Paul is technically a free agent, as he never signed his $14.8 million franchise tender before the accident, and the Giants would prefer the second meeting with Pierre-Paul not occur until he is relatively close to being able to return.\nPierre-Paul had his first visit with the Giants in early September when he reported to the team and allowed it to examine his hand for the first time. The Giants determined he was not ready to play , and sent him back home to continue his rehab.\nPierre-Paul has until Nov. 17 to sign his contract. If he has not signed by then, he is ineligible to play this season. The Giants would receive a two-week roster exemption upon signing him, according to the report, before they would either have to place him on the active roster or the Non-Football Injury List (NFI).\nTeams do not have to pay players on NFI, and many have argued Pierre-Paul's actions since the accident have seemingly been driven by a desire to avoid the NFI list. However, the Giants could place Pierre-Paul on NFI and still pay him, if they desired to do so. Such a setup would likely be the result of negotiations between the Giants and Pierre-Paul.\nSince returning home after meeting with the Giants, Pierre-Paul has taken to social media on several occasions to show he is close to being game-ready .\nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.
