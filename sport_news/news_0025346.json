Cox/Getty Images (NEW YORK) -- NFL player DeAngelo Williams has already dyed his hair and painted his nails pink, but the Pittsburgh Steelers running back said he wanted to continue his support for breast cancer patients and survivors, so he reportedly asked the NFL to allow him to wear pink after October.However, Williams was denied his request by the NFL, according to ESPN.Williams, who lost his mother and four aunts to breast cancer, told ESPN he felt frustrated getting the call from the NFL that he would be unable to wear pink after October, the month during which players wear pink in honor of breast cancer awareness month.\"The same way it made you feel after you heard it -- like, man,\" he said according to ESPN. \"He told me no. I'm assuming they are telling everybody else no as well. ... It wasn't about selling it. You know and I know and everybody else knows before I made the phone call.\"The NFL did not immediately respond to requests for comment from ABC News.While Williams won't be able to wear pink next month, he has continued to help fight the disease. Through his foundation, he is again funding mammograms for 53 women at different centers. It's a program he started last year with two cancer screening centers in Charlotte, North Carolina, and is now expanding to centers in Tennessee and Pennsylvania.On Twitter, Williams said he wanted to honor his mother by paying for breast cancer screening. I just want to elaborate on the \"53 mammograms I’m paying for” because there's much more to it... pic.twitter.com/ehu0zQ1nDt — DeAngelo Williams (@DeAngeloRB) October 16, 2015 \nCopyright   Friday, October 16, 2015 at 1:40PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:51:42.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
