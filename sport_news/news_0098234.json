In order for WVU's conference title hopes to remain alive, they must leave October with wins at No.3 TCU on October 29 and No. 2 Baylor on Saturday, not an easy feat. The Bears will be even more anxious to win in order to avenge last year's loss to the Mountaineers, their only loss of the season that ultimately kept them out of the college football playoffs in 2014. The Bears are ranked No. 2 for good reason. They have the best offense in the country, leading the NCAA with 725 passing yards per game and 64.2 points per contest. At the helm is junior quarterback Seth Russell, who leads FBS in passing efficiency, passing touchdowns and passing yards per completion, just to name a few. Baylor is also the only school to have both a top five running back in Shock Linwood, and a top five wide receiver in Corey Coleman. Ball security must be an even bigger emphasis for the Mountaineers who have surrendered the football 9 times in the past two weeks, as the Bears have forced at least two turnovers in each of their first 5 games, and are third in the league with 13 turnovers gained.
