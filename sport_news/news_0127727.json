Gen. Todd Semonite said.\n\"There will be insurgents over time that can continue to mass ... but the Afghan defense forces are able to come back in and be able to retake those areas,\" Semonite told The Associated Press. \"Kunduz is going to end up being resolved here shortly.\"\nCurrent U.S. plans call for a drawdown to about 1,000 military personnel by the end of next year. However, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan has offered plans keeping a higher level of troops.\nOfficials offered investors details about several airfields, including the one in Kandahar in the Taliban heartland. Some fields already have commercial passenger and cargo flights, while others do not. Many also included a suggested guard force of several hundred.\n\"Naturally, security is a problem,\" said Daoud Sultanzoy, an adviser to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. \"We don't want to be in denial, but we cannot wait until the security becomes a zero issue. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.\"\n___\nFollow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
