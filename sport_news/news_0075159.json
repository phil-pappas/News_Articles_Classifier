Bills coach Rex Ryan said EJ Manuel again took the majority of first-team reps at practice for the Bills, but that Taylor has been progressing.\n\"Tyrod is doing good,\" Ryan said Thursday. \"He's progressively getting a little bit better. But I'm not comfortable saying that he would definitely be the guy, yet.\"\nTaylor said Wednesday he would like to know by Friday whether he's playing, so stay tuned for that. Here are the other injury items of notes from Wednesday.\n1. LeSean McCoy closer McCoy was listed as limited on the injury report, and the Bills still haven't added another running back after Cierre Wood went on injured reserve. Ryan said Thursday the Bills could use fullback Jerome Felton if they needed another running back. Still, Ryan was non-committal on the running back.\n\"He's a lot better this week than he was last week,\" Ryan said. \"I think he's definitely progressing, so we'll let the week play out and see how he looks.\"\n2. Rex won't let Watkins make the call On Wednesday, wide receiver Sammy Watkins all but confirmed he would push through his calf injury in Week 6 because the Bills' offense has been \"basic\" without him. On re-injury, Watkins said, \"if it pops, it pops.\" Ryan said he wouldn't let Watkins make that call.\n\"Yeah, we'll make sure that it won't be his decision, obviously, if that's what he's saying,\" Ryan said. \"We're gonna make sure that ... we'll lean on the experts.\"\n3. No Karlos Williams update Rookie running back Karlos Williams, who scored touchdowns in each of his first four games, still was not at practice Thursday. He hasn't practiced since he suffered a concussion against the Giants, and Ryan said Thursday he isn't sure if he's in the building or whether he has made any progress in terms of the concussion protocol.\n4. The safety position With the Bills placing Aaron Williams on injured reserve, they have a hole to fill at safety. Bacarri Rambo is dealing with a quad injury but was a full participant in practice Thursday. He and Duke Williams could both be in line for snaps in Williams' place, but defensive coordinator Dennis Thurman said the team hasn't made a decision on who will start.\n5.
