Edwards Stadium. \nIt’s Southern Miss’ fifth consecutive loss at the hands of Marshall (5-1, 2-0 in C-USA play), dating back to the 2011 season. \n“We had plenty of opportunities,” third-year Southern Miss coach Todd Monken said. “I thought our defense played well. The good news is, we control ourselves. We have enough talent. There were just too many things we did poorly against a good football team. You can’t expect to win that way, that’s just the way it is.” \nThe Golden Eagles (3-3, 1-1) jumped out to a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. Junior quarterback Nick Mullens led the visitors on an 89-yard march down the field that culminated with a 6-yard touchdown pass to senior receiver Mike Thomas, his fourth of the season and fourth in the last two games. \nBut Thomas was penalized following the play for unsportsmanlike conduct. The infraction was marked off on the ensuing kickoff, which Marshall’s Remi Watson returned 33 yards to the Southern Miss 37-yard line. Seven plays later, Thundering Herd senior Devon Johnson was bounded into the end zone from a yard out to knot it up 7-7. \n“You get a foolish penalty, and you’re kicking off from the 20,” Monken said. “We never really forced them the first \ncouple of opportunities they had to really drive the field. We gave them such good field position.” \nGolden Eagle quarterback Nick Mullens’ assessment was much simpler. \n“I think we just made too many mistakes to win,” he said. “On the road against a good opponent, you’ve really got to find a way to play the most consistent, perfect game you can. Just looking at it, I think we led in almost every statistical category, but this game proves that does not matter one bit. \n“Mistakes will kill you. You’ve got to minimize those and execute better. That’s how you win.” \nSouthern Miss took a 10-7 lead with 11:55 left in the second quarter on freshman Parker Schaunfield’s 33-yard field goal – the longest of his young career. But Marshall’s Deandre Reaves’ set the home team up with good field position, matching his teammate’s 33- yard return, setting the Thundering Herd up at their own 48-yard line. \nDoc Holliday’s squad tied the game at 10-10 on the ensuing drive. \nBut the Golden Eagles’ most critical special teams gaffe came with less than five minutes left in the first half, at the end of a 13-play, 71-yard drive. On fourth-and-goal at the Marshall 4-yard line, Schaunfield’s 21-yard go-ahead field goal try was blocked by Ryan Bee and recovered at the Thundering Herd’s own 33 by Taj Letman. \nMarshall drove deep into Southern Miss territory, but was stopped and poised to attempt a 40-yard field goal. However, the Golden Eagles jumped offsides, giving Marshall new life which it took advantage of, scoring on a touchdown pass from Chase Litton to Ryan Yurachek with 25 seconds left in the first half. \nFrom there, it was all Thundering Herd. \n“The story of the night, we moved the ball down the field, converting on third downs,” Monken said. “Then, you get a field goal blocked and the momentum changes.” \nMullens passed for 314 yards and a touchdown on 29-of-58 passing Friday. Mike Thomas’ 109 yards led the Golden Eagles, while Casey Martin added a team-high nine catches for 85 yards. Jalen Richard paced the visitors with 87 yards on the ground. \nThe Golden Eagles out-gained the Thundering Herd 439-277 on offense Friday. Southern Miss was 7-of-19 on third-down conversions, while Marshall was just 1-of-11. \nSouthern Miss committed five turnovers Friday after committing just five in the team’s first five games of the season. \nThe Golden Eagles return to play at 6 p.m. on October 17 against Texas-San Antonio at M.M. Roberts Stadium. It’s the team’s homecoming game.
