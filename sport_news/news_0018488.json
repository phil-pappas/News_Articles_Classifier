(AP) -- Evan Bush had four saves and posted his fifth shutout of the season to help the Montreal Impact play the Los Angeles Galaxy to a 0-0 tie Saturday night.\nThe Impact (9-11-5) had a pair of early scoring opportunities and another late in the match, but Donovan Ricketts , who finished with five saves for the Galaxy, used acrobatic saves and great positioning to thwart the Montreal attacks.\nIgnacio Piatti found Justin Mapp on a break, but his left-footer toward the far post was poked away by the right hand of a diving Ricketts in the first minute.\nAbout 6 minutes later, Piatti split four defenders a fired a shot from the top of the box but, once again, Ricketts dove a slapped it away. Andres Romero slammed home the rebound from the left flank, but was called offside.\nThe Galaxy (13-8-8) are winless, and scoreless, in their last two matches after averaging 4.3 goals per game during a four-game winning streak that ended with a 1-0 loss as San Jose on Aug. 28. Los Angeles sits a point behind first-place Vancouver in the Western Conference standings.\nSports & Recreation Los Angeles Galaxy Donovan Ricketts Montreal Impact Ignacio Piatti Evan Bush   18901/73864   3483/6818   9482/17045  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:49:20.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
