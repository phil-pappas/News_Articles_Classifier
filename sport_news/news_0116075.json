I think it was done with the idea of trying to hurt our quarterback, and that's bulls--- football.\"\nThe hit occurred in the second quarter of the Titans 38-10 loss to the Dolphins. Mariota remained on the turf for several minutes while being attended to by the Titans trainers and medical staff. He remained in the game, but wore a brace on his left leg, was clearly limping and virtually immobile. He was pulled in the fourth quarter with the game no longer in question. Mariota, who will have a MRI on the knee Monday, said Vernon apologized to him after the game and added he didn't think Vernon's hit was intentional.\n\"I don't think it was malicious,\" said Mariota, who said he expected to play Sunday when the Titans host Atlanta.\nVernon, who was penalized twice for roughing the passer after late hits on Mariota, may face a fine from the league. He defended himself after the game, insisting he is not a dirty player.\n\"I know one thing, it wasn't intentional,\" Vernon said. \"I've never been a dirty player my whole career, so why would I start now?\"\nThe Titans players weren't buying Vernon's explanation.\n\"I think it's bull---- football,\" left tackle Taylor Lewan said. \"It's bull--- to do that to a player - to do that to a guy's career.\"\nTennessee Titans Delanie Walker said he wonders what would the reaction have been if it was Tom Brady or Peyton Manning who took the hit.\n\"That is what they made the Brady rule for â€“ you cannot hit a quarterback low at his knees while he is throwing the ball, plain and simple,\" Walker said. \"He could've ended our quarterback's season with that hit.\"\n-- Geoffrey C.
