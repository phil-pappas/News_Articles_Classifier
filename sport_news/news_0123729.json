(AP) - New Hampshire Fish and Game officers say a hiker who didn't have a ticket for a train that takes visitors to and from Mount Washington twisted his ankle while walking back and took shelter in a hut that was closed for the season.\nOfficers said 26-year-old Ton Wu of Lowell, Massachusetts, hiked up the mountain earlier Sunday with a friend. They planned to take the Cog Railway down, but it was sold out.\nThe two started hiking back on the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail when Wu got hurt. They made it to the Appalachian Mountain Club hut and waited for help.\nTwo officers hiked down from the top of Mount Washington and reached him at about midnight Sunday, about five hours after getting their call for help.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
