Instead, the Nittany Lions' own signal - caller burned Indiana with his legs and his arm, too. Christian Hackenberg threw for 262 yards, two touchdown passes and ran for two scores and Penn State beat the Hoosiers 29 - 7 at Beaver Stadium. Indiana was down to its third quarterback in the game. With Nate Sudfeld injured, backup Zander Diamont started, then was replaced by Danny Cameron after he got hurt. The Hoosiers fell to 4 - 2 for the season, 0 - 2 in the Big Ten.
