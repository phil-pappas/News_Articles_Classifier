Erik Verduzco/Las   Follow @Erik_Verduzco By Steve CarpLas   \nPatton Kizzire proved he can in win in golf's minor leagues. But can he beat the best the game has to offer? \nThe 29-year-old former Auburn University star gets to find out as he plays the PGA Tour on a regular basis for the first time after posting the most money on the Web.com Tour last season. Kizzire earned $567,865 and won twice in 2015, earning his Tour card and a chance to make some big money in 2016. \n\"I've had some PGA Tour experience,\" said Kizzire, who has played a handful of events since turning pro in 2008. \"I think it's beneficial to me to kind of know what to expect and not be a total rookie. \n\"But I'm going to treat it like any other golf tournament. I know a lot of these guys that are out here. I've competed against them. \n\"I'm sure I'll put myself in some uncomfortable spots but I think that's where the growth happens whenever you get in uncomfortable spots.\" \nHe also starts his first full year on the PGA Tour a married man. He and Kari Hodgdon tied the knot last week and he joked about how he has to get used to swinging a golf club with a wedding ring on his hand. \n\"I'm super excited to be a husband and see what I can do on the PGA Tour,\" Kizzire said. \"I want to look back on the year and I say I gave myself the best chance to play well. \n\"I want to win. I have a lot of dreams, a lot of goals — Ryder Cup, Masters — so I'm going to take it week by week and try and get into the mix. Just get off to a good, smooth start and then wake up and find myself in a good spot.\" \nWALKER READY — After helping the U.S. win the Presidents Cup earlier this month, Jimmy Walker is hoping the success he has enjoyed at TPC Summerlin the past few years will ultimately pay off and have him holding the Waterford crystal trophy Sunday at the Shriners Open. \n\"I've always enjoyed playing this course,\" Walker said Wednesday. \"It fits my game nicely. The par 5's are reachable and the greens are always great. I seem to putt really well here.\" \nWalker finished in a tie for fourth place last year at TPC Summerlin, tied for 12th in two years ago and tied for 10th in 2012. \n\"I'm looking forward to the week,\" Walker said. \"Getting off too a quick start is always nice and I'm going to take some time off after this week, so I want to play well here.\" \nPRO-AM RESULTS — Russell Knox's team, which was paced by Knox's 7-under 64, won Wednesday's Championship Pro-Am with a team score of 17-under par 54. Playing with Knox on the winning team were Bryan, Mike and Thomas Buckley. \nFinishing second was Scott Piercy's team at 16-under 55. Playing with Piercy were Jeff Ellis and Aaron and Kevin Hooks. Finishing in a tie for third in the best-ball format at 15-under 56 was Charley Hoffman's team which included Ron Freeman, Deacon Nausler and Paul Sinowitz and Tony Finau's team which included Sean Harney, Trent Keenan and Aaron Taylor. \nANALYTICS 101 — So how did Ben Martin manage to win last year's tournament? \nAccording to ShotLink, which recorded every swing every competitor made at TPC Summerlin, Martin beat the field by 1.896 strokes per round going tee to green and was plus 1.64 in strokes gained putting. \nHe also played superior golf on his back nine, making more birdies (18 to 10) fewer bogeys (three to six) and his score to par (-17 to -3) than he did on his front nine. \n\"I hope I remember to do the same thing this year,\" Martin said. \nAccording to the PGA Tour's statistics, it also paid to play the early events. The winners of the first seven events of 2015 all qualified for the FedEx Playoffs and four of the seven qualified for the Tour Championship. \nFORECAST IS GOOD — It was overcast for part of Wednesday but according to the Tour, which has its own meteorologist, the forecast for the tournament beginning today calls for sunny skies and temperatures in the upper 70s with light winds of 4 to 8 mph. \nContact reporter Steve Carp at scarp@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2913.
