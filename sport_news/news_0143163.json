Having already clinched a second straight Mid-Penn Colonial Division title, the Greencastle-Antrim boys’ soccer team wrapped up its league schedule with a convincing 4-0 shutout of James Buchanan Thursday night at Kaley Field. Despite leading just 1-0 at halftime, the Blue Devils dominated play throughout, holding the Rockets without a shot on goal for all 80 minutes of regulation. With the win, G-A improved to 11-3 overall and concluded its Colonial slate at 9-1. It was also the Blue Devils sixth victory in their last seven games, showcasing an elevated level of soccer ahead of a presumed appearance in the postseason. “It’s the right time of the year to be playing our best soccer,” G-A head coach Scott Gelsinger said. “We came out a little anxious to score tonight. But, once we settled down, we started finishing some chances. Defensively, we’re continuing to play well.” Kaleb Hurley opened the scoring with 10 minutes remaining in the first half, sending a direct kick through the hands of JB’s keeper for a 1-0 Blue Devil advantage. G-A extended its lead four minutes into the second, as Jared Spoonhour sent a lengthy pass from near midfield up top for Shawn Keller. Keller alertly broke on it, getting behind two Rocket defenders before slotting it past the challenging keeper, making it 2-0. Continuing to pressure JB’s end, Avery Wenger headed in a second-chance opportunity that bounced off the crossbar, pushing the cushion to 3-0. Brandon Stuhler added the exclamation point with 10 seconds remaining, producing the 4-0 final. “JB always plays us tough,” Gelsinger said. “It’s a rivalry game and we knew that coming in. Fortunately, we’re playing pretty well right now.” Currently, the Blue Devils are ranked 13th in the always-fluent District 3 power ratings, with the top-20 teams ultimately qualifying for the playoffs in Class AAA. In preparation, G-A will face a few tough non-league opponents within the next week, beginning Saturday at Biglerville. “We play some really good teams in the next week or so,” Gelsinger said. “It’s going to give us quality competition ahead of the postseason, which is definitely a positive.” Contact Ben Destefan at 717-762-2151, bdestefan@therecordherald.com or on Twitter: @bdestefan_RH By Ben Destefan   By Ben Destefan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:27:23.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
