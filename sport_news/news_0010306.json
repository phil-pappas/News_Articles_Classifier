Comment By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 9:00 PM By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 9:00 PM WESTWOOD — The Hopkinton boys and girls cross country teams had to pass one final test before they could claim bragging rights in the Tri-Valley League. Both were undefeated after five meets, but so were both teams from Westwood. And after the Hillers met the Wolverines on Wednesday, Hopkinton’s teams remain perfect on the season with only the Oct. 28 league meet remaining on the TVL slate. The girls opened the final dual meet of the season with a 20-38 victory. The boys then followed suit with a 24-31 win of their own. While both Hopkinton teams improve to (6-0, 6-0 TVL), each Westwood team fell to 5-1 (5-1 TVL). “It’s not quite for the league championship, but it does keep us undefeated which is exciting,” said Hopkinton boys coach Jen Fairbanks. “If — or when — we win the TVL championship, it’s always nice to have the undefeated title with that. I knew today would be competitive, but I was happy to see some of my top guys scoot through for good times at the end.” Although Hopkinton senior Brian Gao led all of the boys with a first-place time of 17:42, the Hillers benefited significantly from third- and fourth-place finishes by freshman Johnny Cowen and senior Sam Danaceau, who finished in 18:09 and 18:11, respectively. While senior Matt Pettepit finished in seventh when he crossed the finish line in 18:33, another senior, Jack McGuire, helped seal the boys victory with a ninth-place finish in 18:55. “We knew we had to get somebody in the top three,” Fairbanks said. “But where my fifth runner finished was really going to make or break it, so I was really happy for Jack to finish where he did.” Even though Gao continued to lead the Hillers at the front of the pack, the senior did have to deal with Westwood freshman Zach Conant, who finished in second with a time of 17:53. “This was the first race where somebody was with me the entire time,” Gao said. “With 400 meters to go people were yelling, ‘He’s right behind you, you have to go!’ I just loved the excitement of the final sprint and was excited to finish in first.” The boys team may have earned its victory by having its top five finishers scattered throughout the top 10, but the Hopkinton girls team dominated the top six. Westwood sophomore Ashley Walker took first with a time of 20:03, though Hopkinton earned a convincing win when freshman Abbi Fischer (20:38), juniors Molly Hawkins (20:50), Julia Burdulis (20:52), and Kerry Driscoll (20:53) rounded out the top five. In addition, freshman Jane Stilwell finished in sixth with a time of 20:59. Although girls coach Brian Hall has relied on elite runners in the past, the Hillers’ pack makes the team tough to beat. Page 2 of 2 - “That is something that is kind of new for Hopkinton, to be honest,” Hall said. “In the past, I’ve always had an elite runner or two who were among the best in the state, but we graduated our top three runners from last year. This wasn’t planned or anything, they just happen to all be about the same which is a great strength for cross country.” While junior Lauren Ness also finished in the top 10 with an eighth-place time of 21:09, it was the team’s first five runners that secured a victory when they each finished within 21 seconds of each other. That depth is something the Hillers’ runners counted on before taking on a Westwood squad that was also unbeaten. “We knew both teams were undefeated, so that put a little more pressure on us today,” Hawkins said. “But we were also comfortable because we know we have six girls who can run in a pack. If one of us is having an off day or falls in a ditch, we know the others will be there to pick us up.” Westwood freshman Bridget Pickard came in right behind Hopkinton’s pack in 21:05, while sophomore Miread Walsh (21:10) and freshman Sarah Conant (21:10) rounded out the top 10 for the Wolverines. Although both Hopkinton teams will likely compete in Invitational meets prior to the TVL meet and perhaps the state meet in November, Hall was ecstatic about his team’s ability to finish this regular season undefeated after there weren’t high expectations entering the fall. “We were completely prepared to have to rebuild this year, but nobody told that to the girls though,” Hall said. “We have two freshman in our top five — they’re all so young — so the rebuilding didn’t really last too long. This is completely new for us.” By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 9:00 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:26:42.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
