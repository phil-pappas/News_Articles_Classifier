Following Sunday's 12-5 loss to the lowly Phillies, which came the day after the Nats were officially eliminated from postseason contention and featured Paps choking teammate Bryce Harper in the dugout and getting tagged with the loss after giving up five runs in the ninth inning. Harper and Papelbon may have said all the right things after their altercation made headlines, but one Nats fan wasn't hearing it, taking to Twitter and offering to donate $100 to a charity of the team's choosing if they parted ways with Papelbon. Soon, others followed suit and now, there's close to $2,000 on the table – with more potential donations piling in by the hour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:10:04.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
