I am grateful we get another opportunity to be in the quarter-final of a World Cup. It shows how tough quarter-finals are and that's the way it should be.\" \nFrance were forced to deny reports their players had launched a revolt against head coach Philippe Saint-Andre ahead of Saturday's last-eight battle. \nAll Blacks assistant boss Ian Foster admitted warning the squad not to expect anything other than a focused and fiery France on Saturday night. \n\"We take no notice of it,\" said Foster. \n\"We're expecting a French team very fired up to be at Cardiff. \n\"It's a goal of theirs that they've shown before, that they can rise for a big occasion, and we're expecting the best of them. \n\"That has been the focus of our preparation all week.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:14:45.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
