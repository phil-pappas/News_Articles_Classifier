He penned his new book from his sickbed on his iPhone, and it is available on Amazon. Lacey Peterson / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. When Mark Nouillan went into the hospital to get a mastectomy, another man laughed at him and said, “Men don’t get breast cancer.” That stereotype is something Nouillan, 48, is trying to fight. While in the U.S., men make up less than 1 percent of all cases of breast cancer, 450 men die from it each year, Nouillan said. “It’s relevant. Especially if you’re the guy that gets it. Your family would be devastated,” Nouillan said. Male breast cancer is a rare cancer that forms in the breast tissue of men. Male breast cancer is most common in older men, though it can happen at any age. Nouillan was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer two years ago at age 46. His girlfriend randomly grazed his right nipple and it felt unusually hard. “She felt it like that,” Nouillan said snapping his fingers. His girlfriend asked him to have it checked out, so he went to the doctor, who then sent him to a breast-care specialist. At the time Nouillan was living in his native Scotland. From 2000 to 2010, Nouillan lived in Groveland and worked as a nature photographer. Nouillan is a career photographer and worked for many years for Meadow Group Newspapers in the United Kingdom and has taken photos of Princess Diana, Luciano Pavarotti and famous athletes like Andy Roddick and John McEnroe. After getting a biopsy and later undergoing a single mastectomy, the lymph nodes in his right arm/armpit area were removed. Then Nouillan had to undergo radiation and chemotherapy. He said he was pretty much bed-bound for a year and started writing a book about his experience to give himself something to do. He wrote the 22-chapter book on his iPhone and titled it, “Getting Cancer Once Is Unlucky … Twice Is Careless.” “The unbelievable truth about this aspect is that most men and their partners are completely unaware of this possibility, and furthermore do not realize that it’s incredibly easy to do a quick check,” Nouillan said. “If you don’t know there’s something that can potentially harm you, how can you check it?” The book is “all about creating something positive in the future,” he said. Nouillan is in California for the next several months to promote his book. He’s living in Twain Harte with a friend and fellow U.K. native, Chris Bjornmose. Nouillan said Tuolumne County and Yosemite National Park are his favorite places to be. The beauty of Yosemite’s natural landscape captured his photographer heart, and the friendly and positive attitude Americans have also makes this his choice for a home away from home. Nouillan was 18 when he was diagnosed with leukemia. He went to the doctor after suffering from bone pain. He got a bone marrow transplant from his brother but also had to get radiation and chemotherapy. At one point, Nouillan was down to 75 pounds, severely underweight for his 5-foot-10-inch frame. Today, he’s a healthy 180 pounds and happily cancer-free. Nouillan said when he had leukemia, there was a point where doctors thought he would die and sent him home to do so. “Miraculously, I didn’t,” Nouillan said. After overcoming leukemia, Nouillan went on to a career in news and sports photography and was a tennis champion at his sports club in Scotland. Since his second round of cancer and treatment, he’s gotten back to good health and is winning tennis games again. He’s playing today in Angels Camp at Bret Harte High School in a game to benefit Butte Fire victims. “When you go through the things I’ve been through, you have to be positive,” Nouillan said. Staying positive helped Nouillan survive, he said. While in his sickbed, Nouillan surrounded himself with photos of Yosemite. It gave him something to fight for, something to look forward to. “The most amazing countryside in the world is in Yosemite,” he said. “It’s a photographer’s dream to live here.” Nouillan said his doctors told him he would only survive another 20 years after his leukemia. After his breast cancer diagnosis, doctors told Nouillan, if they removed all of them, he would have less of a chance of relapse but would lose use of his right arm. Nouillan chose his arm. “It’s not how long you’re here, it’s what you do with it,” he said. The surgery affected his nerves in his right arm, so Nouillan can no longer do photography for long periods of time, so he’s started doing animal/pet photography and has gotten positive feedback from clients so far. He also can’t feel his feet, a negative side effect from the chemo. “All that could’ve been avoided. They could’ve just taken the nipple out if I caught it early,” he said. While undergoing treatment for leukemia, Nouillan said it was the orderlies who helped him keep his spirits up. With so much death surrounding them, the orderlies came in and made jokes and lightened things up. So when Nouillan was undergoing breast cancer treatment, he made it his goal to bring laughter to other patients. He was the only man in the ward among women, and said he had them laughing themselves to tears during what is normally a serious, somber time. It was during that time that Nouillan found a new purpose. “When people are going through this, I like to try to give them guidance and help them through it,” he said. He’s starting a charity, named for famous Scottish warrior William Wallace, Bravehearts Fighting Cancer, where cancer patients and their spouses/family members can go to live for a couple of weeks, and Nouillan will help them create a plan for a compelling future. “You can’t control what the disease will do. What I can help with is getting you feeling good, laughing about life and being positive,” Nouillan said. “You’ve got to be feeling motivated to live. You’ve got to have something in the morning to get up for.” While in Tuolumne County, Nouillan plans to speak to the local cancer support group to share his campaign of positivity and message of early detection for male breast cancer. Men diagnosed with breast cancer at an early stage have a good chance for a cure. Still, many men delay seeing their doctors if they notice one of the usual signs or symptoms, such as a breast lump, according to the Mayo Clinic. For this reason, many male breast cancers are diagnosed when the disease is more advanced. Signs and symptoms of male breast cancer can include: • A painless lump or thickening in the breast tissue • Changes to the skin covering the breast, such as dimpling, puckering, redness or scaling • Changes to the nipple, such as redness or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward • Discharge from your nipple Men should make an appointment with their doctor if they have any persistent signs or symptoms. Unfortunately, because male breast cancer is so rare, there aren’t regular screenings for it by doctors like there are for women, said Dr. Liza Ortiz, Tuolumne County’s public health officer.
