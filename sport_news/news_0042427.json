But we realized, in this church, we do all of that except for clothing. We aren’t clothing those who need clothes,” said Judy Leatherman. \nThe idea was hatched about three years ago to give away baby clothes. From that idea, it quickly grew into Kings Closet after a meeting with Leatherman and husband Doug, Paneen Froneberger and Susan Long. \nDonations of clothing and shoes for women, men and children are stored in a trailer at the church. It took two years to get the trailer where it is now – organized, painted, carpeted and air conditioned. Volunteers sort the items. \n“We wouldn’t want to give away anything we wouldn’t wear,” said Doug Leatherman, who leads the ministry. \nThe church also provides some new underwear and socks. \nDuring the community event, all the items are brought into the church’s all-purpose room to create a shopping experience. \n“While parents are looking around and selecting clothes, there are children in the church who keep the little kids over on the side and have crafts and little snacks with them,” Froneberger said. \nDoug Leatherman said some people return every time. \n“We send out 250 invitations to tell them when the giveaway is gonna be,” he said. “We’ve got several cards back from people thanking us for making this available.” \nSome even return as volunteers. \n“A lot of people who come, come back and say ‘I’d like to help,’” Froneberger said. \nItems left go to Tender Hearts in York. \n“It’s just a privilege to serve in this ministry and to make this available to those who need it,” said volunteer Theresa Fadness said. “I just love to see things being used again.” \nWant to go? \nKings Closet is open 9 a.m.-noon Oct. 17 at Christ the King Church, 13501 S. Tryon St., Charlotte. Call 704-587-0073 or email Jeana@CtKCharlotte.org.
