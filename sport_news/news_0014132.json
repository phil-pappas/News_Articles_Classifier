Sure, most of his coaching staff couldn’t develop anything, not even a cold, if you spotted them a virus — and the team’s win total was on a steady decline — but Hoke certainly brought in talent. That’s clear now. The cupboard wasn’t bare, although the pieces were not exactly polished or even coached up. But Harbaugh has taken care of that. Harbaugh might be nuts and quirky, but he has the Wolverines playing fantastic. \nSecondly, and perhaps more significantly from the Spartans’ perspective, MSU has been hammered with injuries, although I hesitate to use the word hammer because one of these Spartans might take it the wrong way, like to a finger, and get hurt. \nThat’s partly why I ranked Michigan one spot higher than MSU on my Associated Press Top 25 ballot Sunday. \nComing into this season, the Spartans had a lofty ranking and high expectations based on several factors: Mark Dantonio has built a great program, quarterback Connor Cook was returning, and the offensive and defensive lines were stacked. \nThen, everybody got hurt. It’s easier to name injured players than healthy ones. At the end of the Rutgers game on Saturday, eight starters were missing from the game. Some have been out for weeks; and others have come and gone and gotten re-injured so often that it’s hard to keep everything straight. When a backup goes down with injury, you know it’s getting ridiculous. \nSo now, the Spartans are back in a familiar, comfortable position: An underdog with a chip on their shoulder . “Really doesn’t take much to have a chip on our shoulder,” Cook said. \nBut now, it’s actually real again. \nPersonally, I expect the Wolverines to win Saturday; and I have a hard time trying to figure out where Michigan has an edge. \nClearly, MSU has a better quarterback, but they won’t face each other on the field. \nBefore the season, I would have said that MSU was stronger and more physical in the trenches, and that’s probably the only area that matters in this rivalry. As everybody knows, the team that wins the rushing battle wins the big prize, another opportunity (against Ohio State) to be on ESPN’s College Football GameDay. But MSU’s offensive line has been decimated with injuries and running back Madre London is hurt, too. To top it off, U-M has the third-best rushing defense in the country. \nAt his weekly news conference, Dantonio listed off Michigan’s strengths. “I think they’re tackling well, pressuring the quarterback, stopping the run,” he said. “They’re getting turnovers as well. Then on the offensive side of the ball… they’re winning the time of possession, they’re establishing a running game.” \nThat’s a heck of a recipe for success. In fact, it sounds like MSU over the last few years. \nPerhaps, MSU’s defensive line has an edge over U-M’s improved offensive line, especially if the Spartans could bring a blitz, but you also have to consider the MSU secondary. Pass defense has been one of MSU’s weaknesses and bringing a blitz only leaves wide-open holes. \nMSU has to bet that U-M quarterback Jake Rudock won’t find them, especially if it’s deep down the field. Rudock is a game manager, who needs to stay away from turnovers to win. \nSep 12, 2015; Michigan State Spartans head coach Mark Dantonio.

And the injuries and inconsistencies of that offensive line will force him to get rid of the ball quickly. \nAaron Burbridge is Cook’s favorite receiver. But when he lines up outside, he will be covered by Jourdan Lewis, one of the top corners in the country. And when Burbridge goes to the slot, he will probably be covered by Jabrill Peppers, a talented defensive back who can line up anywhere. \nMeanwhile, the Wolverines are playing a lot more man-to-man coverage, and that allows them to bring more pressure on the quarterback with blitzes. \nYou starting to sense a vicious circle here for the Spartans? U-M seems to have a counter for everything that MSU can do. \nMichigan even has an edge on special teams, which has been a weakness for MSU. \n“That’s got to be cleaned up,” Dantonio said. \nOn special teams, Michigan will counter with Peppers, a big-play machine, and if the Spartans to try avoid Peppers, they will have to kick off to Jehu Chesson, the fastest player on U-M’s team. \n“We have to play well,” Dantonio said. “They’re not making a lot of mistakes.” \nCan MSU win? Sure, if U-M chokes and turns the ball over and MSU plays a perfect game. \nBut I doubt that will happen. \nSo let’s cut to the chase. If the Wolverines win, has the balance of power shifted back to Ann Arbor? Come on. I’m not ready to say that. Both of these programs are fantastic. \n“We can co-exist,” Dantonio said. \nI agree. That’s the great thing. As long as the two coaches stick around, we could have something special for years to come. \nContact Jeff Seidel: jseidel@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @seideljeff .
