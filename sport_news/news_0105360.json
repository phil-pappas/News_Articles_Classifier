The Eagles lost late, 3-2, their fifth straight defeat to start the season. ( Photo courtesy of Standout Imagery ) \nGood teams find ways to stay in games and great teams find ways to win them. \nThe Colorado Eagles are certainly not finding ways to win. Staying in games is somewhat of a mixed bag, and there's no question they're doing things to hurt themselves in losses. \nNobody is willing to quit on this club just five games into the season, or call the Eagles a bad team quite yet. However, it's clear something isn't right as Colorado dropped its fifth contest to kick off the 2015-16 campaign, the latest a 3-2 defeat at the Budweiser Events Center to Rapid City. \n\"Well it's frustrating because we're obviously not learning from our mistakes. It's just little bounces, little details that make a huge difference and we're just finding ways to lose at this point,\" Eagles assistant captain Sean Zimmerman said. \"It's almost just snowballing now and we've got to put a stop to it.\" \nIt's the same story each time out for Colorado this year. The same mistakes repeated again and again that make wins difficult to come by. Missing easy chances, playing from behind and surrendering untimely goals have been the plot line all along. \nSaturday showed no signs of progress. \nScoring continued to be a laborious task for the Eagles, coming into the contest averaging two goals per game, with four of their eight scores requiring the power play to generate. \nWhile the man advantage hasn't carried the same struggle for goals (as Colorado entered Saturday ranking third in the ECHL with a 33.3 percent success rate), even-strength tallies continue to elude a club that expects to bury the puck on a consistent basis. \n\"It's not going to get any easier. We just got to bear down and make those plays happen; make sure they go in the net. It's not going to get any easier for us,\" Zimmerman said. \"Those plays aren't going to just starting going in. Once we bear down and get a few, then I think we'll be alright. But until we do that and make simple plays, not trying to be so pretty some times, we'll be in trouble.\" \nThe two sides battled through a scoreless opening period and the draw held true for a majority of the second as well. It wasn't until the final 5 minutes that the action bore any fruit. \nRapid City (3-1-0, 6 points) tickled twine first, despite being drastically out-shot by the Eagles 21-12 by the end of the second period. Daniel O'Donoghue's rebound finish 15:03 into the frame supplied the Rush a 1-0 edge, marking the second time in as many nights scoring first. \nThe Eagles (0-4-1, 1 point) seemed doomed to start the final period from the trailing position yet again, but forward Jesse Mychan managed to convert a rebound of his own — created from a Jake Marto shot — into the tying goal with 30 seconds remaining. \nMychan's third goal of the season salvaged something from an otherwise disappointing offensive frame for Colorado, which missed a golden opportunity earlier due to great individual effort from Rush netminder Danny Battochio to make a diving save. \nBut poor timing struck the Eagles again as Rapid City pulled back out in front midway into the third. Yet it didn't mark Colorado's downfall. That would come later. \nRookie Christian Isackson displayed terrific patient and held the puck, circled back into the low slot and fired an equalizer past Battochio 2 minutes later. But a bounce off an Eagles shin pad trickled to the Rush's Winston Day Chief's stick for the winning goal with 1:55 remaining. \n\"It's a broken record. There's no excuses. You have to create your own opportunities, create your own luck and that's just all there is to it. This is not going without a solution. There will be a solution,\" Colorado coach Chris Stewart said. \"It's tough for us to run into these bad bounces and not take advantage of good bounces. \n\"You don't want these losses to pile up, absolutely. That's not healthy for anybody. But the fact of the matter is we've had more good chances than bad; it's just a matter of taking advantage of them. We've got to go to work and straighten this out. That's all there is to it.\" \nCris Tiller: 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/cristiller \nRush 3, Eagles 2 Rapid City 0 1 2 — 3 Colorado 0 1 1 — 2 \nFirst period — No scoring. \nSecond period — Rapid City, Day Chief 2 (Descoteaux, Narbonne), 15:03. 2.
