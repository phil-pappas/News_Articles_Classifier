(WTOP/Noah Frank) \nWASHINGTON — We’ve had a couple close games early turn to blowouts late in our DMV Game of the Week contests. And while some enormous matchups loom next week, there are some great games lining up around the region this week as well. \nThe most meaningful matchup in shaping the local landscape is the battle of MoCo unbeatens Damascus (8-0) and Seneca Valley (8-0). The Hornets haven’t played a game closer than 37 points since their season-opening 39-17 win over Quince Orchard, outscoring opponents 422-70 on the year. The Screamin’ Eagles have been dominant in their own right, allowing more than 7 points just twice all year, all while averaging 46 points per game. \nArlington’s Washington-Lee got off to a rough start this season, dropping four of five. But the Generals (4-4) have won three straight, including a 28-0 whitewashing of McLean last weekend as they prepare to host the Madison Warhawks (7-1), who have reeled off seven straight wins. \nIn the spirit of College GameDay coming to Harrisonburg last weekend, we’re giving a couple of smaller schools a look this week. That’s why we’ve included Maret (7-1) as they take on Flint Hill (5-2) at Wilson High School in Northwest D.C. \nVote for the matchup you think should be the DMV Game of the Week below by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday and we’ll profile the wining matchup, then travel to provide live coverage on Friday night. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP.
