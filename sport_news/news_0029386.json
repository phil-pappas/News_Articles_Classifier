Related Boasting one of the nation’s top offenses and an early season Heisman candidate in Trevone Boykin, TCU is about to serve up the biggest challenge Kansas State’s defense has seen this season. \nIf football games were only two quarters, Kansas State might just be in luck. \nFor the second straight week, the Wildcats were unable to hold onto a halftime lead, as second-ranked TCU rallied from 18 points down Saturday to stun K-State 52-45 in the final minutes at Bill Snyder Family Stadium. \nThe Horned Frogs took their first lead of the game at 45-42 on a 69-yard touchdown run by Trevone Boykin with 6:07 remaining — capping just a two-play, 75-yard drive. \nK-State answered on its next possession, but may be second-guessing its decision to settle for a 37-yard field goal on fourth-and-1, instead of going for it and trying to hold for a touchdown. \nThough Jack Cantele made the field goal, it left TCU with 1:47 on the clock — maybe too much time for the Horned Frogs, who entered Saturday with the nation’s No. 2-ranked offense. \n“The options were run the ball or throw it or kick the field goal,” K-State coach Bill Snyder said. “Obviously, the field goal was the wrong thing to do. But that was just one of those choices.” \nAgain, it took TCU just two plays to go back ahead — this time for good — using a 55-yard touchdown pass from Boykin to Josh Doctson. The Frogs converted the 2-point conversion to make it a five-point game. \nNeeding a touchdown to win, K-State (3-2, 0-2 Big 12) got the ball back with less than a minute to play, but Hubener fumbled the ball away when he was sacked on second down to effectively end the game. \n“I did say that I was proud of our youngsters because they didn’t give in,” Snyder said. “We didn’t play well enough to win. But I like the way they came back from last week’s ballgame and the passion and spirit that I hadn’t seen this year, that I thought they played with, and the determination. \n“I shared with them that this one becomes even more difficult to overcome and it would be a tremendous test of our character to prove really who we are. It wasn’t about beating the No. 2 team in the nation, and it never is — it was about us and how we prepare and how we play.” \nIt was a sour ending to a pretty solid game for Hubener, who rushed for a career-high 111 yards and four touchdowns. The junior led a K-State ground attack that was responsible for controlling the clock, dominating the time of possession and essentially keeping the ball out of TCU’s hands. Running back Charles Jones was a big part of that equation, too, as he finished with 75 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries. \nAt times, K-State’s best defense against TCU (6-0, 3-0) was the Wildcats’ offense, which routinely moved the ball for long, methodical drives resulting in touchdowns — though it only lasted the first two quarters. The Wildcats outscored the Frogs 28-3 in the second quarter alone, while holding TCU to just 69 yards of total offense in the quarter. The result was a commanding 35-17 lead. \nUntil last week at Oklahoma State, the Wildcats had won 49 straight when leading at halftime. Now, however, K-State has lost two straight when ahead at the half. \n“We tried to possess the football last week and lost a two-touchdown lead doing it,” Snyder said. “You just have to do what you think people are going to give you and how the defense is playing. They played very well. They played better defensively than we did offensively in the second half.” \nLike last week, the Wildcats went flat in the third quarter and failed to score, or in this case, keep up with the Horned Frogs, who scored 14 points in the quarter to get back into the game, trailing K-State just 35-31 going into the final period. \nHubener opened the third quarter with an interception thrown to TCU’s Derrick Kindred that was returned 60 yards for a touchdown. K-State then punted on its next three possessions before Hubener finally got the Wildcats back on the scoreboard early in the fourth with a 1-yard keeper to make it 42-31. \nBoykin, who finished with 301 passing yards and 124 rushing yards cut into the K-State lead again with 7:55 to play when he scored on a 14-yard rush — capping an 11-play, 70-yard drive — to make it 42-37. \nK-State did not answer, as the Wildcats went three-and-out before punting, setting up the Heisman Trophy hopeful’s go-ahead touchdown on the next possession. \nThe Wildcats won’t have much time to think about this loss, as Oklahoma is headed to Manhattan next week for a 2:30 kick on ABC, ESPN or ESPN2. Texas stunned the Sooners on Saturday, defeating previously unbeaten OU, 24-17, in Dallas. \n“Oklahoma suffered a dramatic disappointment and they’ll be inspired next week against us,” Snyder said. “We have to be exactly the same way to overcome that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:35:36.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
