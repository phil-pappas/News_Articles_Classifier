Shiva fought very well and it is unfortunate that he lost this bout,\" national coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu said. \n\nThe 21-year-old from Assam, the only one from the six-member contingent to be left in reckoning for the Olympic berth, was on the offensive from the very first bell, daring his rival with an open guard. \n\nBesides his very accurate left hook, the Indian also used his right jabs to good effect. However, despite combining his blows with lucid foot movement, which helped him dodge Asanau effectively, the Indian did not find favour with the judges. \n\nThe 19-year-old Asanau, a European Games silver-medallist, continued his defensive approach in the second round and did not come on the front foot even once. However, the approach found favour with judges yet again and he nosed ahead 2-0. \n\nIn the final three minutes, Shiva attacked with all his might and put Asanau under pressure with his aggressive approach. \n\nHowever, Shiva aggression could not trump Asanau's defensive tactics and the judges unanimously awarded the bout to the Belarussian. \n\nIndia thus ended their campaign with one bronze medal but failed to secure a single Olympic quota place.
