Chris Denorfia started in left field, with Austin Jackson in right. Rookie Kyle Schwarber made his first start behind the plate since Aug. 31.\nMaddon used Schwarber as his leadoff hitter Wednesday, and Austin Jackson drove in a career-high five RBIs while playing center field in place of Dexter Fowler.\n“I feel comfortable,” Maddon said. “It’s like, ‘you guys go out there and play. We feel comfortable with you guys out there. The other guys take a break. It’s wonderful.\n“You get to this point, you get it going on and everyone is feeding off one another.”\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Joe Maddon Chicago Cubs National League Austin Jackson Chris Denorfia Kyle Schwarber", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d330c/turbine/ct-cubs-use-different-lineup-20150930"], "published": "2015-10-01T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:57:08.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
