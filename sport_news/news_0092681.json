Finally, fans could take out their anger on the longtime Phillie, who was responsible for the game-changing — and what appeared to be a series-changing — tackle/slide of Tejada.\nFor Mets fans, nothing looked like it could be so much fun, unleashing an overwhelming wave of visceral emotion and unfiltered language. Then, the Mets were introduced. And love was that much stronger.\nFor days, replays showed Tejada’s season ending and leg cracking over and over, the shortstop just a talking point for the state of the game. Monday, he became more.\nExiting the dugout to step onto the field, Tejada became a rallying cry, getting the final honor to join his teammates he could only cheer on for the rest of the fall, hobbling toward the first-base line with a smile and a blue-and-orange cane.\nWhile teammates clapped for the 25-year-old — who has spent all six of his major league seasons with the Mets — Tejada turned to a standing-only crowd and tipped his cap, with many of the fans holding up pictures of Tejada’s face and signs that read “Win for Ruben.”\nTejada joined his teammates and then was carried through the dugout, piggy-back style, by replacement shortstop Mark Reynolds.\nTejada is expected to spend the next six to eight weeks in the cast, but is expected to make a full recovery by spring training.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  ruben tejada", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:31:03.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
