Oregon will play at Colorado on Saturday at 7 p.m. but Oregon senior associate athletic director Craig Pitens said in an email he was not sure if the decals would arrive in time for kickoff due to Hurricane Joaquin.\nIf the decals do arrive in time Saturday, Pitens wrote that Colorado also plans to wear them. He did not specify from where the decals were shipping.\nOregon State's football team has no game this week. The Beavers will next play at Arizona on Oct. 10 and plan to wear the decals for the remainder of the 2015 season.\nUnified for UCC pic.twitter.com/I0l4qQ8son\n— Beavers Football (@OSUBeaversFB) October 2, 2015 Zack Lassiter, a deputy athletic director at Oregon State, said both schools began working on similar helmet decal tributes independently Thursday before getting in contact that night and coordinating the effort.\nLassiter said Oregon State had moment of silence at Friday's men's and women's home soccer games and plans for the same at Friday night's home volleyball game against Utah. He also said the athletic department is in discussion for more extensive tributes prior to Oregon State's next home football game against Colorado on Oct. 24.\n\"We've got a lot of things to work on between now and then,\" Lassiter said.\nOregon State's fall athletic teams plan to wear the \"UCC\" ribbons on their uniforms for the remainder of their respective seasons, according to Lassiter.\nThe University of Oregon painted the black UCC ribbon on Papé Field prior to the Ducks' women's soccer match against Colorado at 7 p.m.\nGreat hustle by our staff to have the UCC ribbon placed on Pape Field for tonight's @OregonSoccer match. pic.twitter.com/odnl90Tedr\n— Craig Pintens (@UOPintens) October 2, 2015 -- Danny Moran\ndmoran@oregonian.com\n@DannyJMoran", "external_links": ["http://t.co/odnl90Tedr", "https://twitter.com/OregonSoccer", "http://t.co/I0l4qQ8son", "https://twitter.com/DannyJMoran", "https://twitter.com/UOPintens/status/650081539493986304", "https://twitter.com/OSUBeaversFB/status/650059388586098688"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:40:20.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
