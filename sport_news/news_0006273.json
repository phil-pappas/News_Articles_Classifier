His reception in London, though, is what really has the Bills coach livid.\nThe polarizing, blustery coach unloaded on headset issues after his Bills couldn’t complete a crazed comeback in a 34-31 loss to the Jaguars at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, a crushing blow for a team that had high aspirations — fueled by Ryan — and now sits at 3-4.\nThere were “unacceptable” issues with the communication system to talk with quarterback EJ Manuel, Ryan ranted, according to ESPN. The headset issues left Ryan hearing static sometimes, silence others, he said. Which didn’t help Manuel, a 2013 first-round pick who has lost favor in Buffalo, and was only playing because of an injury to Tyrod Taylor.\nRex Ryan says there were \"unacceptable\" problems with coach-to-QB communication system. Static, silence, all… https://t.co/OGv7ARdM9C \n— Mike Rodak (@mikerodak) October 25, 2015 \n\nManuel, whose first-half implosion included two interceptions and a fumble, said during the second quarter he had to go to the sideline to hear the playcall. He said the problem was eventually fixed, according to ESPN, but not before the Bills were down 27-3.\nRyan going off on a technical malfunction is a bit out of character for the normally accountable coach. Oftentimes he has squared all the blame on himself after losses — including earlier this season, in a mirror-image defeat to the Patriots, when the Bills dug themselves in a hole they — just barely — couldn’t get out of.\n“This loss is squarely on one man’s shoulders — it’s on my shoulders,’’ Ryan said after that Sept. 20 crusher . “[Bill] Belichick outcoached me, there’s no question about it. It’s unfortunate. We did a horse[expletive] job and it’s my responsibility.’’\nBut when Gus Bradley outcoaches him? Then it’s on the headsets.\n  buffalo bills ,  rex ryan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:03:35.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
