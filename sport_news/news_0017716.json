The competition gives the smaller hockey-playing nations an opportunity to progress to the next round and so on, with the added incentive of Olympic or World Cup qualification. \nEarlier, the FIH announced the names of six nations that will host the HWL Round 2 events - including Trinidad & Tobago, Ireland, Bangladesh, Canada, Spain and Malaysia. \nThe 2016-17 HWL will decide which teams will qualify, alongside the continental champion and hosts, for the FIH World Cups in 2018 in India (men) and England (women). \nAll teams participating in the HWL will also receive FIH world ranking points, which could prove crucial when it comes to qualification for other events. The winners will qualify for the 2018 Champions Trophy in Argentina (women) and the Netherlands (men).
