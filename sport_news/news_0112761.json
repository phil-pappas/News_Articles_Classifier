In many ways, baseball has been the team version of golf.\nThis generation of young fans — the selfie generation of multiple interests and impatience — likes the raw emotion of sports, the exhilaration when players make the right play at the right time: celebrating a decisive home run, a timely base hit, a great defensive play, a rally-ending strikeout.\nThe more emotion shown, the more personality expressed, the more fans become invested in the games.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage It’s Chicago vs. New York, With a Nod to Fred Merkle OCT. 16, 2015 N.L.C.S Preview: Chicago Cubs vs. New York Mets OCT. 16, 2015 Cubs’ Jorge Soler Had a Series to Remember OCT. 16, 2015 History and Intrigue Imbue the Mets-Cubs Series With Extra Flavor OCT. 16, 2015 Daniel Murphy’s Steal Caps Another Lost Dodgers Season OCT. 16, 2015 On Baseball: Theo Epstein, a Former Red Sox Magician, Tries Another Exorcism With Cubs OCT. 16, 2015 Royals 5, Blue Jays 0: Days After Uplifting Victory, Blue Jays Fall Flat Against the Royals OCT. 17, 2015 I like the batter who watches a ball leave the stadium, don’t mind his staring at the opposing pitcher or into the opposing dugout.\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nWhat’s to criticize about the bat flip? It’s the baseball equivalent of football’s end-zone spike.\nThis could be an aberration, but the willingness of players during this postseason to show greater emotion, to let their personalities shine through, is either a function of a new wave of young players coming of age, or a function of the teams that have reached baseball’s league championships. Three are starved for a championship.\nThe Mets have not won a World Series title since 1986. The Cubs’ drought is legendary: The franchise last reached the World Series in 1945 and last won in 1908. Toronto had not, until last week, won a postseason series in 22 years.\nKansas City reached the World Series last year; however, its last trip before that came in 1985.\nOddly, what distinguishes baseball from the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. is that there really are no explicit rules in baseball during the regular season governing celebration and decorum.\nFootball players score touchdowns, sack the quarterback, intercept the ball and are allowed to pound their chests, point to the sky, do a little jig.\nSports of The Times A collection of columns offering opinion and analysis from the world of sports.
