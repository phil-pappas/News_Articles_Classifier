More >> The NFL extended its agreement with Wembley Stadium on Thursday for another five years, meaning the league will play at least two regular-season games a year at the London venue through 2020. More >> \n(RNN) - Snog the missus and leg it to the laptop, the NFL is back in Jolly Ol' England this week. \nLike the Week 4 Dolphin-Jets contest at London's Wembley Stadium, the kickoff between the Jaguars and Bills is slated for 9:30 a.m. ET. Unlike that one, the primary place to view it will be live streaming on Yahoo. \nFun fact: \"Yahoo\" originated in the literary classic Gulliver's Travels , written by one of the UK's great satirists, Jonathan Swift. The Yahoos were primitive, greedy, human-like creatures. Basically, the dregs of the earth ... \n… This is normally the time I'd make a Dan Snyder joke (Hi, Washington!), but I can't stop thinking about Roger Goodell . Maybe next week. Thursday Night Football : Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers, 8:25 p.m. ET \nSeattle's woes have been bad enough to start a grunge revival. \nThe Seahawks' (2-4) two wins come by way of teams who have a combined record of 2-9, and one (Chicago) played without its starting QB. Sure, three of the four losses come to three of the four undefeated teams in the league. But shouldn't the team expected to make a third-straight Super Bowl appearance be beating other good teams? \nThe team is second in rushing, despite Marshawn Lynch's injuries, and its defense is allowing the fourth-fewest yards per game. It's the same formula that has brought the franchise so much success, but neither aspect has been dominant enough to overcome the poor passing effort. \nTeams playing Thursdays come in pretty dinged up by Week 7. Neither is coming off a bye, so both had limited time to heal and plan. That may be the Niners' (2-4) biggest advantage. Playing at home helps, too. \nColin Kaepernick had two strong outings in a row following two awful ones, which fits well with his \"consistently inconsistent\" reputation. If he can pull off a strong performance, he'll start to alleviate the concerns of San Fran fans while exorcising his personal demons against Seattle (1-5 record, three TDs, nine INTs, 18 sacks). \nCarlos Hyde injured his foot and has been listed as questionable this week, but he plans to start at RB for the Niners. Anquan Boldin also showed up on the injury report with a hamstring issue, and he's a game-time decision. Sunday: Buffalo Bills vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, 9:30 a.m. ET \nThe Jaguars (1-5) still have a way to go before they enter the realm of \"good,\" but they have been fun to watch. \nBlake Bortles averaged 289 yards passing while throwing for 12 TDs from Weeks 2 through 6. He's got some nice targets to throw to, with Allen Robinson becoming a downfield threat in his second year and TE Julius Thomas healthy and playing well. \nTheir defense also gives up 29 points per game on average. That doesn't help in the \"W\" column, but it definitely makes the game more exciting … provided you don’t have any emotional attachment to how the team is doing. \nThe Bills won't have Tyrod Taylor slinging the rock around; WR Sammy Watkins is out, and so is WR Percy Harvin; backup running back Karlos Williams is doubtful and starting running back LeSean McCoy just got back from injury a week ago. On the bright side, head coach Rex Ryan may call on you to play a few snaps if you're at the game. \nThe defense was supposed to be one of the NFL's best, but it sits in the middle of the pack statistically. Marcell Dareus and Mario Williams are game-changers on the defensive line, though, and they can stuff the run as well as pressure the quarterback all game long. Fantasy watch: \nStefon Diggs, Minnesota WR: The rookie has thrived since taking over for the injured Charles Johnson, catching 13 of 19 targets for 216 yards. He may be more than a short-term fill-in as well, as Johnson's numbers don't warrant an immediate return to his old job. Owned in 35 percent of ESPN leagues. \nBenjamin Watson, New Orleans TE: Owned in 35 percent of leagues. He got a whopping 12 targets last week, and he has a score in each of the last two games. Time will tell if this is a blip or the start of a trend, but everyone knows Drew Brees likes looking for a big target in the red zone. \nDolphins D/ST: This is a repeat of last week, but it's another good matchup against the Texans on Sunday. In their first game under new coach Dan Campbell, they recorded six sacks - the team only had one in the four prior games. Owned in 38 percent of leagues. \nAnd your weekly Hail Mary is EJ Manuel, Buffalo QB: He'll get the start again with Taylor out and is owned in only 1.1 percent of leagues. The dual threat faces a Jacksonville D that has given up 19 points on average to opposing QBs in standard scoring. \nFollow on Twitter @MattQuillenRNN . \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
