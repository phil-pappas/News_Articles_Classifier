Have you noticed a sense of expansion within you? When you are complemented or you accomplished something that you wanted to, you find that there is something in you that is expanding. When we face failure or someone insults us, we find that something in us that shrinks. Yoga is putting our attention on this something in us that seems to be expanding when we are happy and crushing or contracting when we feel unhappy.\nOften, we feel helpless about our negative emotions. Neither in school, nor at home does anyone teach us about how to handle our negative emotions. If you are upset, you remain upset or wait for time to heal it. Yoga has a secret to turn around this state of mind. It makes you independent. It empowers you to feel the way you want to feel at any time, instead of being a victim of your own feelings. In our experience of teaching half a million people in prisons around the world, this is what we have found: every culprit says he is a victim of something. When we heal the victim in him, the culprit disappears. Something as simple as breath can do this job for us. We just need to learn how to breathe in different rhythms, different patterns, and eliminate that trauma, those strong impressions in the mind, the pain, suffering that we have been carrying in our heart.\nThe author is a spiritual teacher and founder of the Art of Living movement\nHave a spiritual message?
