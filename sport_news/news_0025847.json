(AP) - Authorities are offering a reward of up to $75,000 for information leading to an arrest in the shooting of a 12-year-old Long Island girl.\nThe reward was announced on Saturday as police sought to identify a suspect in Friday's shooting in Hempstead. The shooting left Dejah Joyner with a serious head wound.\nNassau County investigators believe someone on the street in front of the two-story home opened fire. A single bullet went through a plate-glass window and struck the girl.\nPolice have said they're pursuing multiple leads. It remains unclear whether the girl was the intended target.\nAnyone with information is asked to call 1-800-244-TIPS (8477).\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:39:48.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
