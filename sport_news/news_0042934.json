The pumpkins will then be put on a large scaffolding, and have individually controlled lights placed in them to create a spooktacular light show.\n The goal is to create a 400-pumpkin spectacle, a colossal lit up “Punkin’ Manor,” twice as big as last year’s attempt. There will also be another, larger pumpkin patch for kids to decorate with stickers, paint, and markers.\nThis weekend marks the end of the public space’s run. The Lawn on D was started last summer as an experiment to utilize the unused space outside the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center.\nThe light show will run each half hour from dusk to 10 p.m. on Saturday, and sunset to 8 p.m. Sunday and Monday. Carving tools will be supplied, but guests are encouraged to bring their own pumpkins in case the Lawn runs out.", "external_links": ["http://lawnond.com/calendar_events/punkin-fest/", "http://eepurl.com/btSHgH?p1=related_article_page"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:45:46.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
