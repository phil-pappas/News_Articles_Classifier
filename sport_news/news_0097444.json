After the team's loss to Duke, he pounded and splintered the podium .\n\"Why not maybe put (freshman quarterback Eric) Dungey under center, go I-formation and maybe sneak him?\"\n\"When you get your team, you can make that call,\" Shafer said with a chuckle.\nSyracuse football coach Scott Shafer's post-game press conference : 10/17/15 - Virginia Syracuse University head football coach Scott Shafer talked to the press after their tough 44-38 triple overtime loss to Virginia in Charlottesville on Saturday October 17th 2015. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com\nThe line didn't go over well with some, but it was a controlled, tongue-in-cheek response rather than an aggressive jab. Shafer was calm and collected for his press conference, citing improved effort from his team and a young core that is still learning how to compete in close games.\nThe Orange, which blew a 24-14 third-quarter lead, struggled mightily to finish drives early on.\nAfter a Dungey fumble ended the team's first drive in Virginia territory, Syracuse couldn't punch in a 1st-and-goal from the 2. Freshman RB Jordan Fredericks was stuffed twice on handoffs out of the pistol.\nAnother Dungey fumble, this one coming as he was hit while throwing a pass, and a missed field goal magnified the turnover on downs as SU's offense registered 197 yards of total offense before Fredericks put the unit on the board with a 1-yard run.\n\"I really felt like we'd have a shot to get it in,\" Orange offensive coordinator Tim Lester said of the inside run. \"We ran the same play later and got it. You tell the o-line, 'We've got this. We're going to go at it again . We're not going to get pushed back. We're going to hold the line of scrimmage.'\"\nSU entered the game tied for 19th in red-zone execution, which counts both touchdowns and field goals scored.\nLester noted that the team only has one play in which the quarterback goes under center in the entire playbook, and that's the victory formation.\n\"It gives the quarterback better vision, gives him a little more depth on his drop and still allows us to run downhill,\" Lester said.\nLast year, SU ran a jumbo package with three defensive linemen in the red zone. That has yet to be utilized through six games in 2015.\nContact Stephen Bailey anytime: Email | Twitter", "external_links":
