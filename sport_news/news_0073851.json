The RJD complaint was submitted to Chief Electoral Officer of the state Ajay Nayak by party national spokesman Manoj Jha and his state counterpart Chitranjan Gagan who drew the poll panel's attention to Modi's remark that \"Hamara mukabala Shaitan se (now our political contest is with devil)\". The complaint dated October 9 is addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner of India through Chief Electoral Officer, Bihar. It alleged that the PM used \"disparaging and insulting\" remarks against RJD chief in his several political rallies in Bihar yesterday by \"deliberately fabricating rumour and baseless\" allegation against him. Besides, he also went on not only to brazenly appeal to a particular caste but used provocative language for Yadavanshis/Yadavs violating the model code of conduct, it said. \"These inflammatory and insulting speeches made by the PM also blatantly violates Article 153 of the IPC which amounts to promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony,\" the complaint alleged. It drew attention of the EC towards newspapers coverage of PM speech. The RJD complaint said this disturbed the political atmosphere and the idea of free elections that these kind of insinuating remarks were coming from no less than the PM. \"We urge you to have an informed look on the seriousness of the matter raised by us and take strong action by not allowing him (PM) to address further rallies so that the true spirit of fair elections is upheld and peace is not threatened,\" it said. After addressing four rallies yesterday, the prime minister will address elections meetings at Sasaram and Aurangabad. Launching his campaign for Bihar poll from Munger yesterday, the PM had said Lalu Prasad cannot absolve himself of his beef remarks by claiming that it was the \"devil\" (shaitan) on his tongue which made him say it, and added \"I want to know how the shaitan got the address (of Lalu)...he recognises that it was the shaitan in a similar manner as people recognise their relatives.\" He made similar reference in subsequent rallies at Begusarai, Samastipur and Nawada. —PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:43:39.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
