The security brigade couldn’t prevent a heckler from shouting: “Hey Derek, if you see Matt Barnes, let him know I said, ‘What’s up?’ ”\nIt was the only disturbing moment to an otherwise successful night in Washington, when the Knicks’ souped-up triangle offense racked up 115 points, 7-foot-3 rookie Kristaps Porzingis secured 10 rebounds and Carmelo Anthony looked, for the second straight preseason game, like a perfect 10.\n“He’s remained upbeat,’’ Anthony said regarding Fisher’s demeanor after The Post’s report Fisher had flown to Los Angeles earlier in the week on the sixth day of training camp and got into a brawl with Barnes as the result of a love triangle . “He’s not let that get into our locker room. When you have that from the leader, then it trickles down.’’\nRight now, Anthony is leading on the court — scoring 17 and 21 points in his first two games on a combined 18 for 25. Coming off surgery to repair a torn patellar tendon, he looks in terrific shape, as does his shot.\nAnthony said he has “clarity,’’ and no longer is bugged by “ticky-tack injuries’’ that plagued him all through his 2014-15 campaign that ended in late February.\nEven he is surprised how smoothly things have gone, chalking it up to an intensive rehab still in its final stages.\n“Everything will come back just as far as trying to figure out the angles, pace of the game, the little things,’’ Anthony said. “You guys haven’t seen what I’ve been doing with this rehab. I felt like the rhythm has come earlier than expected. I’m just applying that to basketball, getting back into being physical out on the court and in practice, trying to be as physical as possible. Getting that pop, pushing off the leg, at first I didn’t think I’d get it back this soon.’’\nAnthony battles with Marcin Gortat on Friday. Photo: EPA Anthony said the rehab is not complete, that he is in the “last phase,” which won’t finish until the end of October.\n“Right now, it’s the power phase,’’ Anthony said.\nThe power phase is improving muscle endurance and features Anthony doing repeated jumps and one-legged hops.\nThe bigger surprise is the fluidity of his offensive moves and shots, considering the basketball had been out of his hands for so long.\n“I couldn’t shoot until mid, late July,’’ Anthony said. “That was the first time they allowed me to touch a basketball. I wasn’t allowed to go near the court. They had a ‘No Melo on the Court’ sign on the door. They had my picture on the door with an X.’’\nPerhaps a deeper understanding of the triangle has helped. Fisher’s new strategy of increasing the tempo to try to score easier baskets before the triangle sets is sitting well with Anthony. The Knicks coach admits that’s not Anthony’s game and he often has to be “encouraged’’ to run.\n“It’s more about the mindset that you see and his approach to the game,” Fisher said. “He’s being aggressive. He’s making passes when he should make passes. He’s putting in effort on the defensive end and he’s really leading our guys in the direction that we want them to go.”\nDespite speculation Anthony was unhappy with the team’s direction this summer, he has done a solid job so far of directing it himself.\nThe Knicks face the Wizards for real Oct. 31 — Washington’s regular-season home opener.\n“It always feels good knowing where we’re trying to be as a team, what we’re trying to accomplish, even though it’s preseason,’’ said Anthony, whose club hosts the Sixers on Monday at the Garden. “There were moments during the game where we saw a lot of upside for us as a team. We want to take advantage of those moments and keep it going.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under carmelo anthony ,  derek fisher ,  new york knicks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:12:33.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
