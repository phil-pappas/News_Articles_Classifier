He's come a long way in a week.” \nWyman averaged 42.3 yards per punt on three attempts Saturday, including one that was downed inside the 20. \n“I love that dude,” Beaty said. “He had a couple of tough things going today (two missed field goals) but man, he really stood out big for us in the punt game, which is something that had been absent. \nAdded Wyman: “I knew there was a chance of me getting thrown in there and I just wanted to go out there and do my best.” \n— See what people were saying about the game during KUsports.com's live blog .
