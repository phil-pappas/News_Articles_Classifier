Seattle is currently sitting at .500 with a 2-2 record, while Cincinnati is riding high with a perfect 4-0 start. They’ll look to continue that momentum at home as they host last year’s Super Bowl runner-up team, the Seahawks. The 2015 NFL live streaming and TV coverage arrives from various sources on Sunday.\nAccording to NFL.com in their Oct. 9 injury report, Seattle will go at it without the services of star running back Marshawn Lynch. A hamstring injury that also had him sidelined against the Detroit Lions in the Seahawks’ Monday Night Football win, will keep him out of action Sunday at Cincinnati. Coach Pete Carroll said the team is optimistic that he’s getting there and will be potentially able to play by next weekend, but they’ll see how he is about midweek. Seattle can desperately use him as they attempt to climb into postseason contention again.\nMeanwhile, the Cincinnati Bengals have been off to one of the several undefeated starts in the league so far this season. They’ve compiled a 4-0 record racking up wins over Oakland, San Diego, Baltimore and Kansas City. Now they’ll get a test in the form of Seattle and their No. 2 defense in the league, although the Seahawks are 0-2 on the road. Cincinnati currently ranks second in the league for overall offensive yards with 1,688, trailing only Houston who played a game this past Thursday. The team is fifth in passing yards and seventh in rushing, making for a potent attack.\nThe Bengals are currently favorites in this game by just three points at home, with a -170 price on the moneyline. As the underdogs, Seattle is priced at +150, with the over/under points total at 43 for the game. Future odds still have Seattle among the top contenders to win this season’s Super Bowl with odds of 6 to 1, making them third on the list behind Green Bay and New England. Cincinnati is fourth on that list and tied with Denver at odds of 10 to 1 to win it all.\nSunday’s Seattle Seahawks vs. Cincinnati Bengals game has a start time scheduled for approximately 1 p.m. Eastern Time. The live television coverage will be provided by FOX affiliate stations in various regions of the country. A live streaming online feed can be accessed by cable and satellite customers on Fox Sports Go service, where available. Other live stream feed options include NFL Game Pass, Verizon NFL Mobile and Sunday Direct Ticket for subscribers.
