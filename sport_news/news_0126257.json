Ellis made two defenders miss with a spin move and buried a shot to lift the Chiefs to a 2-1, double-overtime victory over St. Joseph on Wednesday afternoon. \n“I saw the two guys and honestly didn’t think I was going to get through them to make the shot,” Ellis said. \"I was thinking about passing it to (Chris Gazzara), but I got through. So I just thought it’s an open lane, let me just take it.\" \nBuena led 1-0 throughout the first half and after falling even in the second half, Gazzara had a chance to finish off a penalty kick to be the senior hero. \nIt didn’t go as planned. \n“I awarded (Gazzara) the penalty shot,” Buena coach Tom Ruhl said. “He’s not usually our shooter, but I figured he’s caused enough penalties all year long that he deserved it on the Senior Day. \n“He blamed the wind. The wind pushed it wide. They still battled and we had even more opportunities after that miss and a heck of a shot to finish it off.” \nAll that mattered at the end was that the team took home the victory. \n“It was good that we picked it up. I definitely messed up on the penalty of course,” Gazzara said laughing. “We’ve been switching the penalty takers all season because it’s really just for fun at this point.” \nThe opening goal for Buena came from a nice play between two seniors. Joey DeLizza and Eric Perez. The normally defensive players had a nice connection down the left side to leave DeLizza alone with St. Joseph keeper Josh Kahler. \nDeLizza dribbled past and finished off the play. \n“I received a ball from the middle on a bounce,” Perez said. “I one-timed it and it just luckily went through two defenders straight to (DeLizza) and he finished it.” \nThe idea was to put different players in positions to have an effect on the game. It worked out perfectly. \n“Eric is normally my one stopper,” Ruhl said. “He played that beautiful ball to DeLizza, my left fullback. I had them playing left and right half so they could push up and have fun on their Senior Day.” \nThe game was tied on a goal from St. Joseph midfielder Chris Lopez off a corner midway through the second half. \nThe contest could have been out of hand early, as the Chiefs had multiple chances on goal in the first. \nThe sun made things difficult for the goalie defending the left side to see the ball and play usually favored whichever team was attacking that end. \n“We dominated the first half. It was 1-0, but it felt like 5-0 coming off the field,” Ruhl said. “That’s what happens when you’re rebuilding, but St. Joseph came out in the second half and were moving the ball around really well. They were connecting passes in bunches and getting crosses off.” \nSt. Joseph’s Sean Heefner almost gave his team the lead on the left side of the field, but Buena stood tall with good defensive play from junior defender Randy Knapp and sophomore goalie Fermin Osorio, who finished with five saves. \n“(Knapp) did a great job even with a hamstring problem,” Ruhl said. “He stuck it out and played the whole game. He’s been playing well the whole year and just keeps it going.” 6 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vineland.dj/1LMMngg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:11:40.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
