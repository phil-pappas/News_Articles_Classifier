Then her stepson's teacher made it clear that while the mother would receive all school-related materials, the father and stepmother would have to request copies and provide self-addressed, stamped envelopes.\nThe stepmother, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation toward her stepson, wrote to The Oregonian/OregonLive, \"We are very curious about what the schools' policies are regarding divorce and stepfamilies. ... Anything we can do to help schools be more friendly and accommodating to divorced parents and stepfamilies will feel like a big step forward and will help create peace for all parties.\"\nAs fall parent-teacher conferences and the school year's first report cards approach, Oregon education officials say they aim for equal accommodation for divorced and stepparents, but they have to abide by court and district documentation if there is uncertainty or conflict about which parents receive paperwork or attend events such as conferences.\nThe Oregon School Boards Association , whose functions include recommending policy to school boards, suggests this policy when it comes to divorced parents: \"The Board encourages parents to be involved in their student's school affairs and, unless otherwise ordered by the courts, an order of sole custody to one parent shall not deprive the other parent (of) access to school records. ... Only if the parent having sole custody presents a court document to the contrary will the noncustodial parent be denied access to the records.\"\nThe association recommendations also state, \"It is the responsibility of the parent with sole custody to provide any court order that curtails the rights of the noncustodial parent at the time of enrollment or any other time a court order is issued.\"\n\"We are aware of about 30 districts, (education service districts) or charter schools that have adopted some version of these,\" said Alex Pulaski, a spokesman for the association.\nDan McCue, a spokesman for the David Douglas School District , said it has no written policy on accommodating divorced parents. But \"we always start with the premise that both parents have equal rights,\" he said.\n\"We'll oftentimes send two report cards out,\" McCue said. With phone notifications, \"we'll send those out to both phone numbers.\" Referring to ParentVue, software that many districts use to inform parents of student attendance, grades and other information, he said, \"In the case of two households, both parents will have their own accounts.\"\nAs for parent-teacher conferences, McCue said, it's \"preferable\" that biological parents attend together. \"If they can't do that for whatever reason, we do try to accommodate by, for instance, creating two conferences,\" he said.\nIn the case of disputes over who gets what, the district requests copies of court orders. \"We need to see the documentation,\" McCue said.\nThe district will insist on following court orders even when parents are willing to bend them, McCue said. He recalled an incident in which a custodial parent agreed the ex-spouse could join a parent-teacher conference, but the court order restricted attendance to the custodial parent. \"We said, 'We're sorry, we really want to work with both parents but we have to work with what the law is.' \"\nThose parents would have to return with a revised court order for both to get access, McCue said.\nEducators also use student registration forms to determine who gets access. Karl Newsome, principal at Astor School, a K-8 school in North Portland, said the school provides information to parents \"if they are involved in the child's life and are on the school registration form.\n\"If they're not on there, that would be a situation where we're not providing the information,\" he said.\nWith parent-teacher conferences, Newsome said the school's goal is having as much parental participation as possible regardless of parents' marital situation.\nThe bottom line, McCue said, is that \"it's all about the kid.\"\n\"We really do look at it as, we as educators, you as parents need to come together as a team because this is about the child,\" McCue said. \"It's all of our responsibility.\"\n-- Amy Wang\nawang@oregonian.com\n503-294-5914\n@ORAmyW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ORAmyW", "http://www.osba.org/default.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-20T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:48:05.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
