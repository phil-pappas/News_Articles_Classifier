China? India? At what rate? Ten percent or even 15 percent tax free? This is all just another compelling reason to abandon the construction of this boondoggle of a high speed-rail from nowhere to nowhere.\nThe cost estimate of $10 billion which we voted on is now $68 billion, and who knows what it will be before it is finished? And where are the federal funds that were promised? And if finally it is put into operation, will it operate at a profit? You can bet it won’t. Wake up California before it is too late. Stop the high-speed rail before it bankrupts our state.\nG. M. Cameron\nHemet\nVotes over citizens\nRe: “San Francisco reaffirms its status as immigrant sanctuary” [News, Oct. 21]: The Democrats have proven beyond any doubt that votes are more important than the lives of U.S. citizens.\nWhat a sorry bunch of anti-American buffoons.\nThis country is doomed.\nChuck R. Bolton\nSan Jacinto\nTragedy averted\n“Trust in police pummeled” [Editorial, Oct. 20] mentions Nicholas Johnson being shot from a helicopter, but did not mention that Mr. Johnson was driving at a high speed on the wrong side of the freeway. All drivers should give their grateful thanks to the Sheriff Department’s helicopter for averting possible horrendous head-on collisions.\nMaureen Baker\nCorona\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
