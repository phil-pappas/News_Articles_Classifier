Protesters held up banners saying \"Free media cannot be silenced\".\nPolice and court officials were not immediately available to comment.\n\"They are trying to silence the media. This is not befitting Turkey.

Last month prosecutors launched an investigation into Dogan Media Group for alleged \"terrorism propaganda\".\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:10:23.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
