Colin Kaepernick is running/scrambling for nearly 50 yards a game. Carlos Hyde is averaging a respectable 4.5 yards per carry. Vernon Davis, Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith are pass targets.\nBut it doesn’t add up to much in the first season after Jim Harbaugh’s departure. The 49ers’ 289 yards per game ranks 31st in the NFL. Kaepernick has thrown just two touchdown passes against five interceptions and been sacked 14 times. And two of his top offensive linemen, guard Alex Boone and tackle Joe Staley, missed practice Wednesday with injuries, so things don’t figure to improve much against a Giants team that handled a similar quarterback in Tyrod Taylor last week in an easy win at Buffalo.\nThe Giants lost TE Daniel Fells to MRSA, a scary development that caused them to scrub their facility. And they have some injury concerns on defense with LB Devon Kennard likely out and DE Robert Ayers and George Selvie, CB Jayron Hosley, CB Trumaine McBride in various states of disrepair. But the 49ers aren’t bringing enough firepower to challenge what’s left of Steve Spagnuolo’s crew.\nThe pick: Giants -7. \nBUCCANEERS (-3) over Jaguars: Standard home-team-minus-3 line is the linesmakers’ way of saying “What else is on?” Jaguars are hurting in the passing game, with Julius Thomas out and Allen Hurns, Marqise Lee and Marcedes Lewis all listed.\nTITANS (+2) over Bills: Without LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins, there wasn’t much left of the Bills’ offense against the Giants, and now RB Karlos Williams is in the concussion protocol. Marcus Mariota is putting up nearly 30 ppg in his first three career starts, and is coming off a bye week when he had time to figure some things out.\nBrowns (+7) over RAVENS: It took about 12 miracles to get the Ravens their first win last Thursday at Pittsburgh. This is still the same questionable bunch that started 0-3, only now without as much urgency, and without WR Steve Smith. Lot of points for an AFC North showdown.\nFALCONS (-7) over Redskins: Some props to the ’Skins for their 2-2 start, but it’s going to be hard for them to hang with this high-powered Falcons’ offense which has put up 39 and 48 points the past two weeks.\nBears (+8¹/₂) over CHIEFS: Kansas City gets a schedule breather after losing three in a row in a brutal stretch against Denver and at Green Bay and Cincinnati. The Chiefs need this one, but don’t see anything that warrants laying this number. Bears coach John Fox is 9-1 against Kansas City in his career.\nEagles coach Chip Kelly Photo: AP EAGLES (-5¹/₂) over Saints: The danger here is that things will get ugly at the Linc if the Eagles get off to a bad start, with the fans ready to unleash against Chip Kelly. And there’s the real possibility the Eagles 1-3 record is who they are. If there’s a good team somewhere in there, it had better show up this week.\nPACKERS (-8¹/₂) over Rams: You want to go against Aaron Rodgers at Lambeau, where he has thrown 48 TD passes and 0 interceptions in his last 19 games? Didn’t think so.\nBENGALS (-3) over Seahawks: Long trip for an early game after a strange Monday night win for the Seahawks. That’s normally a witch’s brew of a bad betting situation for a West Coast team. While he’s not quite Rodgers at Lambeau, gotta love Andy Dalton in the Jungle, particularly with the number fairly low.\nCardinals (-2¹/₂) over LIONS: Detroit isn’t as terrible as its 0-4 suggests, and is going to win eventually, so this is a scary spot for Arizona. But the Cardinals are coming off a home loss and are averaging almost three touchdowns more per game than the Lions (37.0 vs. 16.5).\nPatriots (-8) over COWBOYS: Off a bye, undefeated, in prime time and pissed at the world, the Patriots are back, ready to name another score. The depleted Cowboys add Greg Hardy, but this genius already taunted Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen.\nBroncos (-4¹/₂) over RAIDERS: The teams have scored the same number of points, 97, and the Raiders actually have a 47.5 yards per game edge. But the Broncos bring a defense that’s No. 1 in yardage and No. 2 (to the Jets) in points allowed, and it’s hard to ignore the two blowouts (41-17 at Oakland and 47-14 at Denver) last season.\nMonday night Steelers (+3) over CHARGERS: Some big names coming off suspension in Pittsburgh WR Martavis Bryant and San Diego TE Antonio Gates. Steelers still have Michael Vick in for Ben Roethlisberger, but they have some extra time to prepare off a Thursday game. Chargers are banged up on the offensive line and at wideout. Tough call. Maybe the small head start from the spread will come into play.\nBest bets: Patriots, Titans, Bengals\nLast week: 4-11 overall, 1-2 Best Bets\nLock of the week: Patriots (Locks 2-1 in 2015)\nThursday night: Colts\n  bettor's guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:21:38.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
