Grier is considering an appeal. \nThe eighth-ranked Gators (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) have a news conference Monday afternoon and are expected to announce Grier's suspension. \nGrier, a freshman, has started the last five games for the Gators and would have started Saturday at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0). Sophomore Treon Harris is expected to start in his place. \nGrier is the first Florida quarterback to pass for more than 200 yards in three consecutive games since Tim Tebow in 2009. Grier has completed 65.8 percent of his passes for 1,204 yards, with 10 touchdowns and three interceptions.
