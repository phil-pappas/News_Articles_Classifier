(AP) — Mark Iannotti threw for 275 yards with three touchdown passes — including the game-winner in overtime — to help Southern Illinois beat Youngstown State 38-31 on Saturday. \nIannotti found Israel Lamprakes for a 24-yard touchdown on the first possession of overtime. Youngstown State (3-4, 1-3 Missouri Valley) went for it on fourth on the subsequent series, but Jody Webb’s halfback option pass fell incomplete out of the side of the end zone. \nA partial punt block late in the fourth by Chase Allen led to Southern Illinois’ Austin Johnson kicking a game-tying 18-yard field goal to force overtime with 6 seconds left. \nEarlier in the fourth, Iannotti hooked up with Daquan Isom for a 75-yard catch-and-run touchdown to pull within 5, and the 2-point conversion made it a 3-point game. The Penguins went three-and-out, leading to the partial block. \nSouthern Illinois moved to 3-4, 2-2.
