The third came Thursday night, a 27-20 triumph in Houston, again with Matt Hasselbeck starting for an injured Andrew Luck .\nUnlike last week's win over Jacksonville, there was never much doubt in this one for Indianapolis. Even when the Texans hit on a miracle Hail Mary to end the first half —aided by some downright comical Colts coverage—the reigning division champs refused to buckle. Indianapolis answered that score with an emphatic touchdown drive to open the third quarter, reestablishing a 10-point lead.\nThree thoughts on the Thursday nighter:\n1. How about Matt Hasselbeck?\nThe 40-year-old Colts backup QB had to check into a hospital earlier this week with a bacterial infection. Hasselbeck still felt so under the weather before the game, the NFL Network's Stacey Dales reported, that he required IVs all day and wasn't sure he would have enough energy to play four quarters.\nAdd in that the Colts were playing on a short week, on the road, and Hasselbeck could have been forgiven for an awful showing Thursday night.\nInstead, he turned in a gem.\n“It wasn't as hard as I thought before the game,” said an emotional Hasselbeck, choking back tears on the NFL Network afterward. “I honestly didn't know if I could make it through. For some unknown reason I was able to finish. I can't explain it. It was amazing.”\nNFL Video NFL Power Rankings Week 5: It may be Bengals' year as they jump into top 3 by Chris Burke", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ChrisBurke_SI"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:45:50.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
