The decision was made after vice-chairman of the Board Kuldeep Raj Gupta and leaders of the community objected to the inclusion of some “non-Pahari speaking persons” in the Board while ignoring the “genuine and real stakeholders”. On October 14, the state government had nominated 67 members to the State Advisory Board for the Development of Pahari Speaking People, which received strong criticism from the community leaders and social activists who alleged that inclusion of members from non-Pahari areas was a deliberate attempt by the vested interests to sabotage the 40-year-old struggle of the community to get the Scheduled Tribe status. “The names of persons indicated at serial numbers 2, 14, 16, 17, 26, 27 and 64 shall be deemed to have been deleted from the government order number 1367-GAD of 2015, dated October 14,” stated a government order issued on Wednesday. Accordingly, Abdul Rehmand Kashmiri of Thatri, Doda; Hassan-ud-Din of Pranu, Doda; Mohammad Iqbal Katoch of Pogal, Ramban; Molvi Fayaz Daing of Neel, Ramban; Abdul Rashid Malik of Sunjwan, Jammu; Iqbal Hssain Shah of Surankote, Poonch; and Ranjeet Tara of Rajouri, have respectively been shunted out of the Board. The new members incorporated in the list are Kaniza Fatima of Karnah, Kupwara; Abinash Jasyal of Choudry Naar, Rajouri; Aazam Shah of Thanna Mandi; Azhar Manhas of Surankot, Poonch; Sanjay Dutt of Naban Mohalla, Rajouri; Dheeraj Sharma of Dhangri, Rajouri; Qazi Abdul Lateef of Hari Surankot, Poonch; and Sunil Gupta. Sources said the government buckled under the pressure of coalition partner BJP, which had opposed the list, saying its leaders were not consulted before finalising the names of the members. Kuldeep Raj Gupta, who is also a senior BJP leader, had also expressed resentment about the inclusion of names which were not suggested by him and said some members did not fall in the Pahari community category. “I was surprised to see the list. Many names suggested by me did not find place in the list. I was asked to submit names of 40 persons, but to my surprise 67 members were included in the list,” Gupta had said. The BJP leader also said the matter was taken up with the PDP president Mehbooba Mufti who had asked him to submit names non-Pahari members in the list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:19:12.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
