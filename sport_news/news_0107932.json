Playoffs return to Wrigley Field, no sign of Steve Bartman FILE - In this Oct. 14, 2003, file photo, Chicago Cubs left fielder Moises Alou reaches into the stands unsuccessfully for a foul ball tipped by fan Steve Bartman, wearing headphones and a Cubs hat, against the Florida Marlins in the eighth inning during Game 6 of the National League Championship Series at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Twelve years after that fateful night when he deflected a foul ball that appeared destined to land in Alou's glove and help land the Cubs in the World Series for the first time since 1945, it is tough to find someone who has a bad thing to say about Bartman.
