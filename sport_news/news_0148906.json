Els saw off fifth-seeded Patrick Selepe with a straight sets 6-2, 6-2 win to advance, Meanwhile, Venter wasn’t threatened in her straight-set victory, dropping no game against Lethabo Shai. Els says: ‘I enjoyed the match today, I was relaxed and my game plan just came together. It is not going to be an easy trip going into the semi-finals because I haven’t played Daniel Shmulik before but I am prepared and looking forward to the challenge.’ Els will take on Israel’s Daniel Shmulik in Tuesday ’s semi-final round. Second-seed Nico Langmann of Austria and third-seed Israel’s Amir Levi were among the other seeded men who won their matches. The country’s Gwitja Mayenzeke seeded-eight did not give it way easy to fourth-seeded Daniel Shmulik of Israel in the last men’s quarterfinal match that took over two hours. The quarterfinal match between Mayenzeke and Shmulik was about as close as you’d expect a faceoff of the world’s number 40 and 43 players to be, as they split the first two sets. The Israeli dropped the second set, but dominated the third to win the match 6-1, 2-6, 6-2 to advance to the semi-final round. Former junior world number one and women’s top seed Mariska Venter won her quarter-final round match comfortably with a straight sets win. Venter dispatched unseeded Lethabo Shai 6-0, 6-0 and will go head to head against fourth-seeded Nonkanyiso Nyosi in Monday’s semi-final round. The women’s second seed, Thando Hlatswayo, won her match to reach the semi-final round as she advanced with a 6-0 6-1 win over Lerato Mathonsi. Hlatswayo next plays third-seed Nokwande Hlongwane, who toppled Simamkele Zondwayo 6-0, 6-0. Play starts at 09:00 on Tuesday.
