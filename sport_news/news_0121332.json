Create turnovers \nThe Bearcats are one of the most explosive teams in the nation on offense. Through their first five games, Cincinnati has averaged 39 points and 589 yards a game. The Bearcats would be virtually unstoppable if they did not have one glaring weakness: turnovers. \nSo far, Cincinnati is coughing up the ball 3.2 times per game. Only three teams in the FBS have turned the ball over more. The two quarterbacks of Hayden Moore and Gunner Kiel have thrown five interceptions each. This could prove to be the difference in the game since BYU has been good at creating turnovers this season. The Cougars have forced at least two turnovers in five of their first six games. Look for BYU to create some turnovers and give the offense short fields. BYU players celebrate with Bronson Kaufusi (90) of Brigham Young after he intercepted a pass against Connecticut during NCAA football in Provo, Friday, Oct. 2, 2015. (Ravell Call/Deseret News) Protect Tanner Mangum \nIt is uncertain to what extent Mangum is injured. Last week, he looked very sore with a hamstring injury and had to be helped off the field. It's doubtful that he will be at 100 percent this week and will probably lose some of his mobility. \nWith this being the case, it is essential that the Cougar offensive line protects him and creates a pocket for him the whole game. That is a tall order for a team that is giving up 3.3 sacks a game. BYU ranks 119th in the nation in that category. To be fair, some of that falls on Mangum, who has been known to look downfield for a big play and hold on to the ball too long. Mangum will need to do his part and make his reads quickly and get the ball out of his hand fast. Keep the defense off the field \nThe only team that has really stopped Cincinnati on offense is itself. The BYU defense has been up and down this season and is giving up 400 yards of offense a game. It is unrealistic to ask the Cougars to shut down the Bearcats. With this being the case, the offense needs to keep the defense off the field as much as possible. BYU has done that better this season than they did in the first two seasons of offensive coordinator Robert Anae's \"Go Fast, Go Hard\" offense. Last season, BYU's offense only controlled the ball for 45.39 percent of the game. This season, that number has jumped up to 52.18 percent, which is good for 45th in the nation. Still not ideal but it has taken some of the pressure off the defense. \nThe Cougars will need to sustain long drives on offense, mingled in with some turnovers by the defense, to slow down the Bearcats.
