The Eagles won 27-7. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports Despite some early hiccups, the Philadelphia Eagles secured the NFC East division lead with their win over the Giants on Monday Night Football. This by no does not by any extent mean the Eagles are a good football team; the jury’s still out on that. All this means is they are better than the rest of the teams in what is, arguably, the worst division in football. Lets get a team by team look at the rest of the teams in this dumpster fire of a division.\nAdChoices Washington Redskins (2-4 ): Perhaps the lowest point of the Eagles’ season was losing to the Kirk Cousins-led Washington Redskins. Cousins has an abysmal 6.23 yards per attempt this year, and has thrown some of the worst interceptions you will ever see from a professional quarterback. Head coach Jay Gruden, who seems extraordinarily gifted at alienating his players, criticized the rest of the team for Cousins’ struggles, saying the team had to make Cousins look better. On top of the quarterback controversy, the ‘skins are missing their best wide receiver, DeSean Jackson, and their pass defense has been inconsistent at best. This team does not look like it’s leaving the NFC East’s cellar any time soon.\nNew York Giants (3-3) : This team looked absolutely horrible Monday night, but they are actually a lot better than their record shows. The Giants are a couple of fourth quarter collapses and clock management miscues from being 5-1. Although Eli Manning certainly looked like Peak Eli on Monday Night Football, he has been far more efficient under Offensive Coordinater Ben McAdoo’s scheme throwing to superstar Odell Beckham Jr. The problem for the Giants’ is their pass defense, which is second to last in the league. Without Jason Pierre-Paul, the Giants’ pass rush has been non-existent, and their weak secondary has been exposed. Overall, the Giants are an improved, but still largely average team, whose flaws on defense and mistakes on offense will keep them from the postseason.\nDallas Cowboys (2-3): The Cowboys are the team the Eagles need to watch in this division. Despite devastating injuries to their two most important offensive players, the Cowboys are still in the thick of the NFC divisional race. If Tony Romo and Dez Bryant can return to the field by week eight or nine, as some reports suggest they could, the Cowboys could run end up stealing this division. They have the best offensive line in football, and when healthy, a dangerous and effective offense. On top of this, Greg Hardy looked like the all-pro defensive end he was in Carolina before his suspension. Despite his obvious and disturbing character flaws, Hardy is a player who can transform almost any defense into an elite unit, and should help vastly improve the Cowboys’ stop unit. If the Cowboys can stay within striking distance until their offense is fully healthy, this could be the squad that ends up coming away with the NFC East title.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:27:01.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
