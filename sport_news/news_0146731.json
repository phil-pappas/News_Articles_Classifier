He decided not to address it with his team before its game at Princeton Saturday night, but still hasn’t stopped thinking about it. \n“That’s awful,” Coen said. “I felt so bad. I didn’t even know how to handle that.” \nWarren Hills comes to Lehigh’s 7-on-7 “Shoot-Out” camp every summer, run by defensive backs coach Craig Sutyak – who had also recruited that area in New Jersey for a long time. \n“Their coach (Larry Dubiel) is a great guy,” Coen said. “That made me sick to my stomach. … It’s tragic.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:35:08.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
