Had the drilling been completed as it was at a nearby mine, the report says, the disaster would not have happened.\n\"Although this (drilling) was apparently considered at Gold King, it was not done,\" according to the review. \"Had it been done, the plan to open the mine would have been revised, and the blowout would not have occurred.\"\nAdvertisement REPORT: Read the full Department of Interior report\nThe interior department's report also says the EPA also did not know the potential for disaster at the site and the possible environmental impacts downstream.\n\"The incident at Gold King Mine is somewhat emblematic of the current state of practice in abandoned mine remediation,\" according to the report.\nWhile there are various guidelines for mine reopening work, there is \"little in actual written requirements that government agencies are required to follow,\" the review said.\nThe 3 million-gallon spill above Silverton on Aug. 5 left the EPA facing immense criticism as yellow-orange contaminants flowed from the Animas River across the southwest. In the disaster's wake, the agency has been working to address the still-leaching mine and other area portals that are releasing contaminants.\n\"EPA will carefully review the report. This report, in combination with the findings of EPA's internal review of the incident, will help inform EPA's ongoing efforts to work safely and effectively at mine sites as we carry out our mission to protect human health and the environment,\" EPA spokeswoman Nancy Grantham said.\nThe interior department's report was peer reviewed by the United States Geological Survey and Army Corps of Engineers.\nThe EPA last week began temporary water treatment operations at the Gold King site last week.\nRepublican Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner sent out a statement saying he was \"deeply troubled\" by what the review found.\n\"Based on an initial review of the report, I am deeply troubled that not only was the EPA found responsible for the release of millions of gallons of toxic waste into the Animas River, but it could have been prevented,\" Gardner said. \"I fully expect accountability and transparency from the EPA, and I look forward to a response to my questions surrounding the EPA's insufficient and untimely recovery efforts and its proactive measures to prevent a disaster of similar magnitude in the future.\"\nThis is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.\nGet news alerts in your inbox Sign up for updates and a curated roundup of news delivered to your inbox every morning.\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or @JesseAPaul", "external_links": ["https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2475483/technical-evaluation-of-the-gold-king-mine.pdf", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic", "http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/partners/MediaCenter/embedded_galleries/mc_embed.js", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/partners/MediaCenter/embedded_galleries/mc_embed_styles.css"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:06:25.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
