Manager Paul Molitor, along with several players, came to the top step of the dugout and yelled at Ramirez as he crossed home plate.\nRamirez, Michael Martinez and Carlos Santana drove in runs in the second. Adam Moore added an RBI single in the third.\nMiguel Sano and Eddie Rosario hit solo homers for Minnesota.\nKyle Gibson pitched six shutout innings and Torii Hunter had a three-run double in the fourth, leading Minnesota to the Game 1 win, but the momentum didn't carry over to the nightcap.\nAbraham Almonte started the second with a double and scored on Martinez's one-out single. Martinez took second on center fielder Aaron Hicks' throwing error and scored on Ramirez's double to left-center.\nRamirez took third on Lindor's infield hit. Lindor's high chopper was fielded by first baseman Joe Mauer, who tossed to Pelfrey at the bag.\nFirst base umpire Brian O'Nora ruled Lindor beat the throw. Molitor challenged the play, but the call stood after a review.\nRamirez scored on Pelfrey's wild pitch and Santana's single scored Lindor for a 4-0 lead.\nGibson (11-11) struck out a career-high nine in the opener. Carlos Carrasco (14-12) allowed five runs in three-plus innings in his final start of the season.\nJoe Mauer and rookie Byron Buxton homered in Game 1.\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nTwins: RHP Phil Hughes (virus), who was scratched from his Monday start, pitched the fifth inning of the second game.\nIndians: 3B Giovanny Urshela (sore right shoulder) could return to the lineup Thursday. He hasn't played since Sept. 17.\nUP NEXT\nTwins: RHP Tyler Duffey has not lost in his last eight starts, going 5-0 with a 2.17 ERA. He went six shutout innings in a 4-1 win over the Indians on Aug. 15.\nIndians: RHP Trevor Bauer returns to the rotation in order to give RHP Josh Tomlin an extra day between starts. Bauer only made one appearance in relief.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
