But her declaration that she won't seek his job might make it easier for them to coexist—which would help her business. And perhaps his mayoralty, too.At a City Hall press conference, Moskowitz cited her focus on her education empire, which she hopes to grow to 100 schools from 34 today, as a reason not to run for mayor. She earns more than $475,000 a year as CEO.Success Academy's future growth depends on getting space within traditional public schools and donations from its base of wealthy supporters. Both could have been jeopardized by a campaign.\"Not running for mayor is good for business,\" said Kenneth Sherrill, professor of political science at Hunter College.Education-reform donors, especially on Wall Street, are loath to wade into political scraps, Sherrill noted. Donations to Success Academy would have been seen as investments in de Blasio's replacement.Moskowitz and de Blasio dislike each other, and her decision won't completely thaw their icy relationship. But Moskowitz's charter-school network is already controversial, and running for mayor would have complicated its dealings with the city.\"This parlor game has reached the point where it may have negative side effects\" for Moskowitz's business, one charter-school supporter said, adding that if the de Blasio administration were intent on acting \"irrationally\" toward her, she was smart to remove her political ambitions from the equation. Fantasy sports probe \nEmployees at fantasy sports sites FanDuel and DraftKings are being investigated for profiting from placing bets using internal company data.

Blackstone's murky fees \nThe private-equity giant agreed to pay $39 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission charge concerning a type of upfront fee that it collects from companies it owns. It was the first time in the firm's 30-year history that it was called out by the SEC for violating securities law. Brooklyn explosion not caused by gas \nOfficials eliminated natural gas as the cause of a building explosion in Borough Park, Brooklyn, that killed two and injured 10 people earlier this month. Authorities are now investigating whether an accelerant or some type of fuel triggered the blast. Gas leaks were the cause of building explosions in the East Village earlier this year and in East Harlem in 2014. 3-D printer maker shrinks \nMakerBot is laying off 20% of its staff--the second time this year it has done so. Six months ago, the 3-D printer manufacturer cut 100 staffers and closed three retail stores. Although MakerBot will maintain its 17,000-square-foot Industry City factory , it will move research and development to its headquarters in downtown Brooklyn. MakerBot was a pioneer of low-cost 3-D printing but has struggled in recent years.

Carnegie Hall interim chair \nPhilanthropist Mercedes Bass will temporarily replace billionaire Ronald Perelman as chair of Carnegie Hall. Perelman stepped down after raising concerns about the venue's finances and what he described as a lack of transparency. Mayor to retailers: Shut the door \nWhen the warm weather returns next year, retailers will have to comply with a new law signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week requiring shops and restaurants to keep doors and windows closed while air conditioners are operating. A 2008 law applied only to stores 4,000 square feet or larger. Eateries with sidewalk cafés are exempt. The law goes into effect in 2016 and imposes a $250 fine for the first offense and as much as $1,000 for repeat violations.
