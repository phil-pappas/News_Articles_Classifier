I want us to improve, do our families proud, do ourselves proud, do our country proud and then whatever happens happens.\" \nWallabies skipper Stephen Moore and centre Matt Giteau will win their 100th caps on Sunday but Cheika has not been able to name the strongest XV he possesses. \nInfluential back-rower David Pocock has been ruled out with a calf strain, while an ankle injury also counts out full-back Israel Folau. \nHowever, Cheika did not sweat over their omissions for long, saying: \"It wasn't too difficult leaving the guys out. They couldn't do their jobs and that's the key. You've got to be able to do your jobs in this team and I don't think either player could do it to their full potential. \n\"We've got Kurtley Beale and Ben McCalman coming in to replace them and it's really just a straight swap for those guys. We'll just ask them to improve the team with what they bring and both have already made contributions to the side in this tournament and I'm sure they'll continue to contribute in spades. \n\"We've been working hard over the last 10, 11 months to get real depth in all positions. I know Pocock and Folau are great players but I really believe in the guys who are coming into their positions. That's something we want to build on.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:12:27.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
