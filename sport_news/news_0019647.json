He was sold on Albuquerque this past weekend when seeing the facilities and meeting the entire staff on an official recruiting visit that also included his attending Friday night’s Lobo Howl.\nUguak joins fellow wing player Damien Jefferson, a 6-foot-4 senior from Indiana, as the first two players to give verbal commitments to UNM for the 2016 recruiting class. UNM can not speak about specific recruits until they sign a National Letter of Intent, which men’s basketball players can do on Nov. 11.\nUguak certainly qualifies as one of UNM’s “under the radar” recruits, not even listed in the 2016 recruiting rankings of Scout.com, Rivals.com or ESPN.com.\n“His profile is rising, but he’s still a bit of an unknown,” said Pasha Bains, director and coach of Drive Basketball, the club team Uguak joined this past summer, where he performed well at several tournaments in his first real exposure to many college coaches.\n“I think if he chose to go to a post-grad or a prep school, he’d end up being a high major recruit (in the class of 2017), so I think UNM is doing the right thing getting him now.”\nBains, who played collegiately at Clemson, actually paid a recruiting visit to UNM himself in his younger years with Lamont Long serving as his host. It was an experience he hasn’t forgotten.\n“We’re excited for somebody from our program to go to a school of this caliber,” Bains said.\nAnother Drive Basketball player, 6-7 point guard Jermaine Haley, is a freshman at New Mexico State, though he will sit out as a redshirt this season.\nAs for Uguak, Bains said his only major setback in his recruiting so far has been a general lack of exposure against high-level competition.\nBains said he expects Uguak to be invited to the BioSteel High School All Canadian Game after the coming season, which is similar to the McDonald’s All-American Game in the United States, inviting the top 24 Canadian high school basketball players.\n“He does have that imposing figure,” Bains said. “He’s very filled out and strong for a high school player. He dunks with ease. He can get on the glass and tip dunk and attack from the wing. He’s one of the better athletes playing basketball in Canada right now.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGFPyJUJI0Q?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-10-22T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:37:11.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
