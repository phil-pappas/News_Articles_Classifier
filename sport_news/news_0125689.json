General manager Jerry Dipoto has started the process of interviewing some candidates to find a replacement for Lloyd McClendon, who was not brought back for the 2016 season.\nOn Monday, Ken Davidoff of the New York Post tweeted that Rays’ third base coach Charlie Montoyo interviewed for the job. I was told the interview took place in Southern California.\n#Rays coach Charlie Montoyo interviewed with the #Mariners today for their manager opening.\n— Ken Davidoff (@KenDavidoff) October 19, 2015 \nMost Read Stories Pair split; now can she divorce nickname?

A native of Puerto Rico, he’s been with the Rays’ organization for 19 season, joining the club in 1996 – a year before it’s expansion season.\nHe was a candidate to replace Joe Madden as Rays’ manager last offseason. He’s managed at every minor league level for the Rays, compiling a 1,266-1,142 (.526) record. His teams advanced to the postseason nine times and he’s managed in 63 postseason games (37-26, .587).\nMost recently he managed the Rays’ Class AAA affiliate – the Durham Bulls for eight seasons, compiling a 633-515 (.551) record with seven International League South Division titles, including league-record six appearances in the International League finals with two Governors’ Cup championships (2009, 2013). The Bulls won the Triple A title in 2009.\nHe has a good a resume of experience and working in the Rays organization means he’s been around and embraced advanced analytics and out of the box thinking – something that Dipoto expects from his manager.\nThe Mariners also reportedly interviewed Phil Nevin, who managed Class AAA Reno this past season and was a longtime big league player. Nevin has interviewed with multiple teams.\nStill multiple baseball sources have said that the managerial job likely belongs to Tim Bogar, who served as Dipoto’s special assistant in Anaheim. Bogar was considered the likely candidate before McClendon was let go and that hasn’t changed.\nBogar is under contract with the Angels until Oct. 31. Before that, Bogar served as bench coach for the Rangers for the 2014 season. He was promoted to interim manager on Sept. 5, 2014 when Rangers manager Ron Washington resigned.\nThe Rangers went 14-8 with Bogar as manager. Bogar spent four years managing in the minors before gaining big-league coaching experience with the Rays in 2008 under Joe Maddon and then three seasons with the Red Sox staff. He served as manager of the Angels’ affiliate in Class AA in 2013, leading the Arkansas Travelers to 73-66 record. For his five years of managing in the minors, he compiled a 362-266 record.\nFormer Padres manager Bud Black was mentioned as a possible candidate, though baseball sources have said he likely will not be a finalist.\nIt’s unlikely that a decision will be finalized or announced until next week or possible even after the World Series.\nRyan Divish : 206-464-2373 or rdivish@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @RyanDivish .
