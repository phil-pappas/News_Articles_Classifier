Wealth can be gained and lost at short notice. This saying is not very much in use, but deserves a revival. Its imagery is livelier than the common “easy come, easy go,” and the idea of money flying away like birds, only to come back – though no consolation for people in dire straits – is cheerful. Use it to comfort friends who are short of funds, or to warn big spenders to take it easy before all the birds disappear.\nSource: Egyptian Proverbs, (Al-Ahram Center for Translation and Publishing, 1986) by Ahmed Taymour Pasha\nTranslated by: Nabil Shawkat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:26:21.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
