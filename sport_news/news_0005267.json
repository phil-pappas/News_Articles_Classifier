(Matt Murschel) \nBoth Williams and Fournette have big-play capabilities. \nOf Fournette's 150 carries so far this season, 13 have gone for 20-or-more yards, including six of his 14 touchdown runs (26, 40, 29, 62, 75 and 87). \n\"Watching Leonard in high school …. He's so big. He's so quick and he's so mature and hard to tackle. He has the power to run off-tackle, the patience to see the right hole,\" Brown said. \"That's what Ricky had. He's a little taller than Ricky, but still equally as hard to tackle. \n\"Ricky Williams got so many of his yards in the fourth quarter because people couldn't tackle him. I see the same attribute with Leonard.\" \nBrown says another key to being a talented running back is the ability to stay healthy. \n\"You talk about touches with a great back. You don't talk about runs, because every time you throw it to him, it's a touch. So you have to decide how many touches you want your great back to get when you're going into a ball game and you talk with him and let him understand that,\" he said. \nIn regards to Williams — who had 188 carries through his first six games — Brown said he had a graduate assistant keep tabs on how many times the Texas star touched the football, that way they could decide how many touches he would get in games. But even then, sometimes the needs outweigh the statistics. \n\"Early on, we kept Ricky in to get those yards and to help him because Texas needed some spark,\" Brown said. \"We needed to sell tickets. We needed a reason to be good. He was our reason.\" \nBrown sees that with Fournette as well. \n\"You take a great one and you put him in positions to lead and then he basically gives your team confidence to move forward,\" he said. \n\"You have to love their spirit. You have to love their confidence. But that's just who they are. I saw that with Leonard in high school. Every week they just jumped on his back and rode him.\" \nmmurschel@orlandosentinel.com \nUSC job a hot commodity \nTwo high-profile NFL coaches are reportedly are among a select group of candidates for the head coaching job at USC. Ian Rappoport of NFL.com was reporting Sunday morning Chip Kelly and Sean Payton have been mentioned as possible candidates for the job. There will always be interest in Kelly thanks to the job he did at Oregon, but Payton's name is a new one in the mix. The New Orleans Saints coach has \"some interest\" in the job, according to Rappoport, and the school may be interested as well. The 51-year-old Payton spent the early part of his coaching career as an assistant coach, with stops at San Diego State, Miami (Ohio) and Illinois. Another name floated around this week for the job was Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh — the brother of current Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh . Dan Patrick said on his radio show last week he's heard there is interest in the elder Harbaugh. \nUSC AD suffers health scare \nUSC athletics director Pat Haden required medical attention prior to the kickoff of Saturday's USC-Notre Dame game in South Bend, Ind. Haden reportedly felt light-headed and fell to one knee before making his way to the locker room to be examined by doctors. According to the school per ESPN, he stopped by a local hospital for further tests before flying back to Los Angeles on a private plane. It has been a tumultuous week for the Trojans athletics director who took criticism this week for his handling of the firing of head coach Steve Sarkisian after reports surfaced he had issues with alcohol. \nSpartans hero suffers injury \nPaul Bunyan may grace the top of the trophy given to the winner of the annual Michigan-Michigan State football game, but Jalen Watts-Jackson may have achieved true folk hero status. The Spartans sophomore defensive back scooped up a botched punt in the waning seconds and returned it 38 yards for a touchdown, leading Michigan State to an improbable 27-23 come-from-behind win over the Wolverines Saturday. However, during the postgame celebration, Watts-Jackson suffered what the school said was either a dislocated or broken hip, sending him to the hospital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:45:02.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
