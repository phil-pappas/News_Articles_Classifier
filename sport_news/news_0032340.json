Alan Forrest fired wide of the near post and in first-half injury time, Ayr were punished for their missed opportunities as Kerr Hay crossed and Iain Campbell provided the finish.The Honest Men made a double substitution at half-time and cut the deficit nine minutes later when Graham headed in Gilmour's corner.They were reduced to 10 men with just over 20 minutes remaining when Devlin was dismissed for a bad foul on Denholm but the equaliser came when Greg Fleming saved from Campbell and Ayr broke upfield, Caldwell meeting Michael Donald's cross to level the scores.Caldwell could even have won the game but was twice denied by veteran Rab Douglas while Gavin Swankie tested Fleming at the other end.
