I wouldn’t dare put that much pressure on myself.” \nGates needs one touchdown catch for 100 in his Hall of Fame-caliber career. \nQuarterback Philip Rivers has had plenty of other targets to throw to during Gates’ absence, including fellow tight ends Ladarius Green and John Philips, but few are better inside the 20-yard line. Rivers has thrown 72 touchdown passes to Gates, the most from a QB to a tight end in NFL history. \n“Whatever it is the coordinator wants, whatever position, whatever role he wants me to be in, just try to do that to the best of my ability and things will be fine,” Gates said. “Just find a way to get a win. That’s the most important thing.” \nGates was probably the last guy anyone expected to violate the NFL’s policy on performance enhancing drugs. His squeaky clean image off the field was as sure a thing as his ability to pivot and catch a pass from Rivers, even in double coverage. \nHis suspension was announced in early July. The penalty was four games without pay. \nGates hasn’t shined any light on what he tested positive for, other than to say that his testosterone level was high. On the opening day of training camp, he said a big part of his routine is taking naturopathic medicine, “just taking certain things for my cleansing, my kidney, liver, making sure my sugar level is right.” \nGates took responsibility and said he let the team down. \n“I think you have to be more aware,” he said. “That’s the lesson you learn. You have to understand there’s a multitude of things you can’t have, despite whatever reason, whatever way you want to rationalize it as a player; you didn’t know, somebody didn’t tell you. It doesn’t matter. You’re accountable for what you put in your body … no matter what it is, I’m responsible for it.” \nSome other things to know about Steelers-Chargers: \nWAR OR WORDS: Sharpe said in early July he thought Gates’ suspension “calls into question everything” Gates has ever accomplished. Sharpe said Gates “cheated himself, and he cheated the game.” \nGates said he didn’t try to reach out to Sharpe after hearing the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:27:46.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
