But the Terrapins' re-emergence is only a projection at this point.\nHigh expectations are a good thing and all signs suggest the Terrapins have what it takes to cut down nets in March and April.\nOklahoma (No. 8 in the Coaches Poll, 24-11 last season)\nAmong the three Big 12 schools in the top 10 — Kansas and Iowa State being the other two — the Sooners have the most experience and stability.\nThey return four starters, including reigning conference player of the year, Buddy Hield, a preseason national player of the year candidate who bypassed the NBA to give this Oklahoma team a Final Four ceiling.\nThe Jayhawks and Cyclones bowed out of the NCAA tournament early last March, and Oklahoma broke through to the Sweet 16. Now there's momentum for more from Long Kruger's veteran team.\nCalifornia (No. 14 in Coaches Poll, 18-15 last season)\nLanding two top-10 recruits when your name is not John Calipari means Cuonzo Martin has a freshman class to be reckoned with.\nArizona and UCLA are more proven contenders in the Pac-12, but the abundance of talent on this roster, which includes the return of Tyrone Wallace (17.1 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 4.0 apg), makes it hard to rule out the Bears as Pac-12 favorites.\nThis team's success will hinge upon Martin's ability to mesh and develop all the weapons at his disposal.\nLSU (No. 19 in Coaches Poll, 22-11 last season)\nBen Simmons is the most talented player in college basketball. That's a fact. Whether the 6-10 freshman lives up to it is another thing.\nSame goes for LSU, a program that certainly underachieved last season under Johnny Jones and has knock-off-Kentucky ability. A veteran backcourt fueled by Tim Quarterman and Keith Hornsby will help foster a strong team culture for a youthful team that is short on maturity and long on talent...and confidence.\n\"I think we'll win the national championship,\" freshman Antonio Blakeney told reporters over the summer. Setting the bar high isn't a bad thing, eh?\nVanderbilt (No. 20 in Coaches Poll, 21-14 last season)\nThe SEC's longest-tenured coach, Kevin Stallings, has a roster poised to challenge Kentucky and fend off other SEC foes (ahem, LSU).\nThe Commodores, who won 10 of their final 14 games last season, have an adept inside-out attack that starts with 7-footer Damian Jones, who should take an All-American-type leap as a junior. Jones controls the paint, and Vandy's perimeter game is as good as it gets — returners Matthew Fisher-Davis, Riley LaChance, Luke Kornet and Wade Baldwin all made at least 40 three-pointers last season.\nTitle teams usually have a mixture of either good depth, experience, a talented big man or excellent shooting. Vanderbilt has all of them.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://sportspolls.usatoday.com/ncaa/basketball-men/polls/coaches-poll/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:52:57.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
