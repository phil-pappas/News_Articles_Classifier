It's too early to speak about him. \n\"He will stay with us. Nobody goes in January - not Riyad (Mahrez), not him, not (Jeff) Schlupp, nobody. \n\"We want to improve and to achieve our goal as soon as possible so I need, the club needs and the fans need all our best players to stay.'' \nVardy is currently one of the leading goalscorers in Europe - level on nine league goals along with Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller in the Bundesliga. \nHe has scored one more than Barcelona's Neymar and as many as the Brazilian's fellow La Liga stars Cristiano Ronaldo, who has six goals, and Lionel Messi combined. \nRanieri believes Vardy has the potential to get even better. \n''I hope he can continue but football is strange,\" he said. \n\"It is not important to think about goal or no goal, but it is important for him to think about how he plays for the team. \n\"I think it is too early to say (he is up with the best in Europe). It is the first year he has shown what he can do in the Premier League. \n\"He scored 16 in the Championship and now he starts to learn with a big champion, and I hope he can improve again. If he can continue in this way, it will be fantastic.\" \nVardy suffered a wrist injury during the 2-2 draw at Southampton last weekend but he will play against Crystal Palace on Saturday.
