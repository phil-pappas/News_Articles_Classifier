The Royals advanced to the World Series with a 4-3 win. (John Sleezer/Kansas City Star/TNS) By ANDY McCULLOUGHThe Kansas City Star, (TNS) \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The savior for Ned Yost, the right arm who waved the Kansas City Royals into their second World Series in a row, stood a few feet shy of third base as Eric Hosmer’s single soared into right field. Mike Jirschele, a minor-league lifer turned big-league coach, squinted as the baseball settled into the corner. \nHe earned infamy among certain fans for his refusal to send Alex Gordon in Game 7 of the World Series last year. Now he transformed his arm into a windwill, ordering Lorenzo Cain homeward, bringing in the pennant-capturing run in the eighth inning of a 4-3 Royals victory over the Blue Jays in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series. \nThe RBI single from Eric Hosmer, who scored Cain all the way from first, capped a gut-wrenching evening with a scene of ecstasy. The Royals benefited from a mistake by outfielder Jose Bautista, who thundered two home runs on this night, but chose to throw to second rather than home on Hosmer’s hit. Jirschele saw it all the way, and the Royals ran straight back into the World Series. \nThe victory means the Royals will host Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night against the New York Mets. The Mets are in search of their first championship since 1986. The Royals, of course, have not captured a title since 1985. \nIn the bottom of the frame, Wade Davis stared down Josh Donaldson, the probable American League MVP, with two outs and two on. Softened by the rain, wrenched into misalignment by Yost, Davis still induced a groundout to send the Royals back to the Fall Classic. \nDavis collected the save after sitting out more than an hour because of a rain delay in the eighth inning. He helped camouflage a colossal blunder by Yost before the rain came. \nThe eighth inning was a catastrophe wrought by inclement weather and ill-advised bullpen usage. Holding a two-run lead heading into the eighth, Yost chose Ryan Madson to pitch instead of sending in Davis for a six-out save. \nYost did so despite a sizable layoff for Davis, who had pitched only once in this series. Yost did so despite Madson’s pitiable history against the Blue Jays, who hit .600 against him in four regular-season games this year. Yost did so even though Davis already recorded one six-out save this postseason, in Game 4 against Houston, and even though a victory allowed for three days off until the World Series. \nInto the game came Madson. Two pitches into his outing, Davis started to warm up, creating a surreal split-screen that heightened the madness of the inning. Madson gave up an infield single to outfielder Ben Revere. He struck out Josh Donaldson. But facing Jose Bautista, Madson threw a 96-mph fastball at the letters. \nAs Davis threw to the bullpen catcher, the baseball soared in his direction. The sight shocked the crowd, packed to capacity and prepared to celebrate the pennant. After a walk to Edwin Encarnacion, Yost pulled Madson and sent in Davis, who promptly retired the next two batters. \nAt this point, the rain intervened. The game entered a delay that lasted 45 minutes. The weather may have played a role in Yost’s thought process, as he did not want to lose Davis for the ninth inning due to the weather. Even so, he still chose to expose Madson to the best hitters on Toronto’s lineup, rather than deploying Davis, an All-Star and perhaps the best reliever in the American League. \nAnd yet the Royals still won. The offense is too talented. And Davis appears indomitable. \nBen Zobrist and Mike Moustakas supplied home runs in the first two innings against Toronto ace David Price, who stymied the Royals thereafter. At last the hitters chased him in the seventh. Alex Rios continued his torrid postseason with an RBI single off reliever Aaron Sanchez. \nYordano Ventura held Toronto to one run across 51/3 innings. Kelvin Herrera collected the next five outs. Plenty of drama awaited around the corner. \nFighting to stave off elimination, Toronto started Price, the southpaw star they acquired shortly before the trade deadline. He sought to recalibrate his inglorious postseason history. A fan near his dugout held a sign to project Price’s postseason record as a starter if he lost this game: “The Price Is Wrong,” the sign read. “0-8!!” \nThe Royals had already toppled Price in Game 2. Price subdued his hosts for six innings before a seventh-inning rally vanquished him and provided Kansas City a two-game lead in this series. \nThere was little waiting around on Friday. The hitters swung away from the first pitch onward. In the bottom of the first, Price spun a cutter toward Zobrist, his former teammate in Tampa Bay. Zobrist stung a drive down the left-field line. The ball just cleared the fence. \nAn inning later, Moustakas came to the plate, nursing a .150 batting average in this series, a .132 average for the postseason. Price picked up two strikes on Moustakas, but left a 1-2 changeup over the middle. Moustakas unloaded on the pitch and scorched a line drive toward the Pepsi Porch in right-center field. \nAs the ball approached the stands, a pair of fans wearing gloves reached over the railing. The winner was a dark Wilson model attached to the left hand of Caleb Humphreys, a bearded, bespectacled 19-year-old from Blue Springs. Humphreys caught the ball as the crowd went wild. \nDown on the field, Bautista pointed in disgust. Toronto manager John Gibbons asked for a challenge. As the umpires conferenced with replay officials in New York, Humphreys felt nervous. He told a reporter from The Kansas City Star he was praying for the homer to be upheld. \nThe prayer of Humphreys and thousands of others issued inside the park during the interim were answered. The homer stood. The lead doubled. \nUp two, responsibility transferred to Ventura’s slender shoulders. He understood the gravity of the evening, how he might guide his club toward the game’s greatest stage. He had been wobbly for much of the postseason, with opposing hitters clubbing him to the tune of a .909 on-base plus slugging percentage. As a fix, he tried a subtle technical tweak. \nVentura does not utilize an elaborate windup when he pitches. But he operated exclusively out of the stretch from the start on Friday, even when there were no runners on base. Dividends were paid early on, as Ventura struck out four with his curveball across three scoreless innings. \nIn the fourth, he fell behind Bautista, 3-1. It was Ventura’s first three-ball count of the game. Sitting on the fastball, Bautista obliterated a drive that nearly reached the Royals Hall of Fame past the left-field fences. The ball looked bound for Des Moines. \nThe blast did not dent Ventura’s confidence. He left shortstop Troy Tulowitzki motionless with a full-count curveball to end the inning. Ventura stared daggers at Tulowitzki as he walked off the mound. Umpire Jeff Nelson waved his mask at Ventura and shooed him off the field. \nWhen he returned to action, Ventura lacked the polish of his first four innings. He walked catcher Russell Martin. After a walk to outfielder Kevin Pillar, the bullpen phone rang and Luke Hochevar stood up. Inside the dugout, Yost made no move toward the mound. \nThe lineup turned over when second baseman Ryan Goins flied out to center. A flyout by leadoff hitter Ben Revere allowed Yost an opportunity to intervene. Surely he would send Hochevar to face Donaldson, Toronto’s most dangerous hitter and the likely American League MVP. \nA gathering convened on the mound. Yost was not part of it. Salvador Perez slapped Ventura on the backside. Alcides Escobar thumped Ventura on the chest. Moustakas hollered words of encouragement and jogged back to third base. \nMoustakas did not wait long for action. Donaldson scalded a low line drive down the line. The exit velocity of the baseball clocked at 114 mph. The ball’s journey ended in the webbing of Moustakas’ glove. His hand still stinging, Moustakas sprinted off the diamond to a standing ovation. \nDespite the escape, Yost continued to tempt fate. He sent Ventura back out to face Bautista to start the sixth. Bautista hit a harmless fly, but Encarnacion thumped a two-base hit to the wall. The double ended Ventura’s night and placed the fate of the Royals in the hand of their bullpen. \nIn first was Kelvin Herrera. He blew away first baseman Chris Colabello with a 100-mph fastball for one out. Two days after giving up a critical double to Tulowitzki, Herrera induced an inning-ended flyball in the rematch. \nHerrera returned for the seventh and pitched a spotless frame. Now came the critical decision for Yost: Madson or Davis? He chose Madson. The decision backfired. But the Royals still survived.
