Tyus Battle is driving from New Jersey with his younger brother Khalif . And Matthew Moyer is flying in from his prep school in Connecticut. Those two touted Class of 2016 recruits join 7-foot-2 transfer Paschal Chukwu to form the next generation of Orange hoop prospects. \nThey will likely will be joined at Friday's Madness by Cameron Reddish – a 2018 guard who attends Westtown School. Reddish right now is the No. 8 overall prospect in ESPN's Class of 2018 rankings. He hails from Haverford, Pa., and attended Orange Madness last year. \n\"He's a kid that excels in the classroom,\" his AAU coach Rob Brown of Team Final said. \"He has a very strong family background and they demand a lot from him. He's probably close to 6-7 and I don't think he's done growing. He might outgrow the point guard position. He does have some trouble with smaller guards coming up on him.\" \nReddish could be joined Friday night by Jahvon Quinerly , a point guard in the Class of 2018, plus Class of 2017 prospects Quade Green and Dhamir Cosby-Roundtree. Green and Cosby-Roundtree, teammates at Neumann-Goretti High School in Philadelphia, want to attend, their coach Carl Arrigale said. But arranging transportation could be an issue. (That's a problem for plenty of teenagers trying to get to Midnight Madness festivities.) \nGreen is a 5-foot-11 point guard; Cosby-Roundtree a 6-foot-8 forward. Both players attended SU's Elite Camp this year. People who know the young players said they are close friends who have considered choosing the same college.

Dennis Nett | dnett@syracuse.com Donna Ditota | dditota@syracuse.com \nA high ankle sprain prevented Green from playing at the NBPA Top 100 camp in June. (I attended the camp and saw Green in an orthopedic boot.) He has moved up the recruiting boards since to No. 44 in ESPN's Top 60. Green, said Arrigale \"can really shoot the ball.\" He attacks the basket and gets past defenders with his dribble. \nCosby-Roundtree, Arrigale jokes, \"could not walk and chew gum at the same time two years ago.\" Arrigale said the slender forward has improved more than any player he's ever coached. (Rick Jackson and Scoop Jardine are Neumann grads.) When Jim Boeheim visited, Arrigale said, he compared Cosby-Roundtree to Jerami Grant. Rob Brown of Team Final, describes Cosby-Roundtree as \"a guy who has really sneaked up on people.\" \n\"He's an intelligent kid. Very intuitive, very smart,\" Brown said. \"We use him as a 5 because of his size, but he has developed into a 4.\" \nQuinerly, a 6-foot point guard from Hackensack, N.J. , plays on the same AAU team as Naz Reid (Roselle Catholic) and Louis King (Pope John). Syracuse is recruiting all of those players and has made scholarship offers to Reid and King in the Class of 2018. \n\"Jahvon had a fantastic summer,\" said his Sports U AAU coach Brian Coleman. \"He's a point guard who can really shoot. He plays with a high IQ. He led the league in scoring and assists for his age group.\" \nColeman describes Louis King as \"probably the most improved kid we have in the program.\" He no longer attends Roselle Catholic. King, a 6-foot-8 forward, will play this season at Pope John XXIII, the alma mater of former Syracuse recruit Moustapha Diagne. \n\"He's a true wing who can shoot, handle, is a good passer and has a high IQ,\" Coleman said of King, who attended SU's Elite Camp. \"He causes mismatch problems. He's hard to guard. Last year, he wasn't as polished as he is now. But he still has a long way to go.\" \nNaz Reid, said Coleman, is \"6-foot-10 with his shoes off.\" The Roselle Catholic big man has \"some perimeter ability.\" Coleman said his summer staff wanted Reid to be more assertive on the offensive end. ESPN ranks Reid the No. 6 prospect in the Class of 2018. \n\"He's very intriguing, very athletic,\" Coleman said. \"He was actually a football quarterback but he grew too tall for the sport. He has quarterback instincts on the basketball court.\" \nSyracuse has also shown interest in Reid's Roselle teammate, 6-foot-9 forward Andre Rafus. Current Syracuse forward Tyler Roberson played at Roselle Catholic. Lonnie Walker is a 2017 combo guard from Reading, Pa. Walker attended SU's Elite Camp and Syracuse has shown interest. \n\"He's a big guard – 6-4 or 6-5 who has played a little bit of the point,\" Team Final coach Rob Brown said. \"He's an unselfish player. Very athletic and humble. I don't think he understands how good he is.\" \nWatch Quade Green:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:53:47.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
