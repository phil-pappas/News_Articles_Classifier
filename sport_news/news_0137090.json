Servais will be formally introduced by the team next week.\nNew Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto made the announcement. Servais has worked the past five seasons as an assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Angels and worked alongside Dipoto for most of that time. Dipoto resigned as Angels GM on July 1.\nNot only did Dipoto and Servais work together with the Angels, they were teammates for one seasons in Colorado in 2000.\nServais oversaw the Angels' scouting and player development, and had wanted to be on a major league coaching staff. He joined Dipoto and the Angels in 2011 after spending six seasons as the senior director of player development with Texas. Servais was credited with the growth of slugger Nelson Cruz during the time together with the Rangers — Cruz now plays for Seattle.\nServais spent time with Houston, the Cubs and San Francisco during his playing career. He hit .245 with 63 home runs and 319 RBIs in 820 career games. Servais served as a catching instructor for the Cubs for two seasons after retiring and was a scout in Colorado before joining the Rangers front office in 2005.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:13:12.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
