The Highlanders won, 4-0. \nFRANKLIN LAKES — Northern Highlands’ Julia Pash and Casey Richards stood under the bright lights of Ramapo. They were tired, but they were satisfied. \nRichards could barely stand up straight out of pure exhaustion. And Pash was all smiles. They said, almost in unison, that the Highlanders were here to “prove a point” Tuesday night. \nAnd they were able to leave, along with their teammates, with a sense of accomplishment after yet another statement win — this time 4-0 over the Green Raiders — in a season already filled with many. \nAfter the Green Raiders had posted 11 straight shutouts and allowed just three goals all season, Northern Highlands’ goal, they said, was to drop a four-spot in the much-anticipated showdown against their division and Bergen County rival. \nAnd following their four-goal outburst, fueled by Georgetown-bound Richards’ pair, it was mission accomplished for the nation’s top-ranked squad. The Highlanders proved their point. \n“We were a little sick about hearing how good their defense was,” said Richards, who put Highlands on the board with 9:33 left in the first half off a dazzling run and right-to-left cross from Eva Hurm. “They are definitely a great defense and they’ve deserved the attention they’ve been getting, but scoring four on them was something we talked about before the game. \n“We knew how to play against them and we executed.” \nThe execution started with Richards’ first score and carried into the second half. A Pash throw-in deep in Ramapo territory led to a goal off the head of a leaping Joanna Kelly with 28:42 left — the first time Highlands had struck off a Pash throw-in after the senior defender started taking more of them just a few games ago. \nRichards called it the team’s “secret weapon,” before adding with a laugh that “it’s not so secret anymore.” \nHighlands’ Morgan Busacca and Ariel Somple then connected for one of North Jersey’s goals of the year with 22:54 left to put Highlands up three. \nThe Fordham-bound Busacca stole possession around midfield and launched a lead pass to Somple in stride, and the speedy senior one-touched a low-arcing rocket over a sprawling Ramapo keeper from 20 yards out. \n“That was just insane,” Pash said following Northern Highlands’ 21st straight win and eighth straight shutout. “I think we’ve been so successful because we have a lot of scouting reports on all these teams and coach [Tara] Madigan is amazing at finding holes and weaknesses, and we’re lucky enough to be able to execute on them and work on these things in practice.” \nRichards capped the Highlanders’ scoring with 13:01 left off a shot in the box set up, again, by the facilitating play of Hurm on the outside. \nThe Highlanders went to the film in preparation for Tuesday night, re-watching their first meeting against Ramapo -- a 1-0 win on Sept. 16. \nThat was the last time the Raiders had surrendered a goal. \nHighlands then takes what they see on film — both offensively and defensively — and practice against it against essentially a scout team against Highlands’ non-starters. \n“We’ll have other players kind of imitate what we see on film and what we expect to see in a game,” Pash said. “We’ll practice defending how they’re going to attack or attack how they’re going to defend.” \nNorthern Highlands was prepared, they were ready and they delivered — again backing up the claim that they’re the best girls soccer team in America right now. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:06:20.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
