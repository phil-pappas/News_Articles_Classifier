Through the first two sets Madison-Grant had allowed Wes-Del to score more than one point on its serve just once, frustrating the big hitters with blocks at the net on digs on the back line. \nThe Argylls scored in bunches in the first set. The team's lone senior, Mallorie Havens, contributed tips and kills in the middle of the set to forge a 12-5 lead and again at the end to close the set. \nBy the time the Argylls had two players serve in the second set, they were ahead 11-1. Maddie Barnhart had three kills, Havens served two aces and Kelsey Kohlmorgen served one. Wes-Del never got closer than seven the rest of the set. \nThe Warriors changed the script in the third set by taking an early lead at 7-3. But the Argylls tied it at 7-7 on the serve of Sloane Stewart with Kenzie Stitt's tips providing key points. \nThe Argylls led as late as 18-16 on a kill by Havens. But Wes-Del's Emily Hale gave the serve to teammate Morgan Prather. She had an ace followed by kills from Hale and Aerionna Strahan. That gave the Warriors the lead and they were never headed the rest of the set. \nIn the fourth, the Argylls had the upper hand though not a big lead, until Hale took the serve with the score tied at 9-9. The Warriors scored the next eight points, two coming on aces. Three of the points were on kills by Alysa Sutton, who also had a stuff block. M-G clawed back to within three but could never completely recovered. \nNow the match would come down to one more set to 15. \nWes-Del seized the advantage at 7-4 as Paige Townsend asserted herself with tips, kills and blocks for a 12-6 lead. \nMadison-Grant had one more spurt. Barnhart's kill cut the deficit to 14-10 and gave the serve to Kohlmorgen. Barnhart tried to will the team to victory with a kill and a block and a 14-12 score. But Sutton finished things with a kill. \nThe near-miss for the Argylls has happened before as they won the first set twice against Alexandria in the Madison County Tournament before losing the next two. \nMadison-Grant will now be off eight days before returning to action on Oct. 24 when it plays in the Alexandria Sectional against Eastbrook.
