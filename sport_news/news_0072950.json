Jeffrey Phelps/Associated Press FOX Sports Wisconsin Dave Heller Share This Story Updated Oct 19, 2015 at 12:10p ET \nThe formula for the Green Bay Packers so far in 2015 had been, for the most part, stellar play from Aaron Rodgers , a good enough rushing attack and a solid, underappreciated defense. \nWell, that went out the window against the very pass-happy San Diego Chargers . \nRodgers was good, not great; the run game was barely used, but still managed to see its first 100-yard rusher; and Green Bay's pass defense was torched for 503 yards by Chargers QB Philip Rivers . \nYet, somehow, Green Bay escaped with a 27-20 victory at Lambeau Field. A win that quite honestly might be hard to explain when looking at the final statistics. But we'll do our best. \nThe recap of Sunday's game: SUNDAY SCHOOL \n-- The Packers hadn't had a 100-yard rusher all season. James Starks , who had 77 combined rushing yards over the previous three games, was an unlikely choice to be the first to top that mark, but aided by a 65-yard run he did just that, compiling 112 yards on only 10 carries. Starks got the start at running back as usual starter Eddie Lacy , who head coach Mike McCarthy indicated is still slowed by injury, received only four carries (gaining only three yards). As a team, the Packers only had 17 rushes -- and that includes two by Aaron Rodgers. \n-- The wide receiver depth was tested after Ty Montgomery had to leave the game following an ankle injury. Jeff Janis stepped in with two big catches (he had a team-high 79 yards), but the Packers wideout only had six of the 16 catches. Cobb was largely invisible, with just two grabs for 38 yards and Montgomery also had two receptions, for 11 yards. This team really needs a healthy Davante Adams . \n-- Besides Adams, Morgan Burnett , Nick Perry and B.J. Raji were all sidelined for this game. Raji figured to be a big loss as San Diego figured to try and get its running game going, but former Wisconsin Badger Melvin Gordon was benched after fumbling twice and the Packers held the Chargers to 60 yards on 21 carries (2.9 average). \n-- Green Bay did not have an answer for Keenan Allen . The Chargers wide receiver was targeted 15 times and had 14 catches for 157 yards before he had to leave with a hip injury, forcing him to miss much of the fourth quarter. \n-- If you didn't think Aaron Rodgers already wasn't one of the best quarterbacks of all-time, he passed the 30,000-yard passing mark in his career Sunday, becoming the quickest in NFL history to reach that milestone. The previous record holder was Johnny Unitas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:53:41.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
