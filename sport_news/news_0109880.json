The University of Central Arkansass’ Dominique Thomas is a distance second at 87. \nThe challenge is obvious Saturday night in Beaumont, Texas, for the Bear defense, energized by a strong performance in a loss to McNeese State last week. \n“You just don’t stop the guy; you just try to slow him down,” said Northwestern State coach Jay Thomas, whose team defeated the Cardinals, 48-35, last week but yielded 282 yards on 36 carries and five touchdowns. “When he goes out of the game for a rest after getting 100 yards or so, you breathe a sigh of relief. Once he cracks the second level of defense and gets past the linebackers, I haven’t seen a defensive back who could catch him.” \nUCA coach Steve Campbell added, “He has tremendous vision and great cutback ability. He is hard to tackle; he breaks a lot of tackles and he has really good speed. He looks a step faster than last year. He gets into the open field and he hits a home run. \n“That offensive line can open holes and he doesn’t miss a cut.” \n“Our players were telling us last week, ‘Coach, we’re all around him trying to get him, .said Jay Thomas’” \nThe Cardinals lost to Sam Houston State, 49-46, and to Southeastern Louisiana, 30-27. \nCampbell also says the Cardinals have a quarterback and wide receivers to add to a “pick your poison’ attack. \nLamar coach Ray Woodard says his offensive line may be underrated. \n“They are not the greatest one-on-one players but out the five together and they just play well together.” \nBut Woodard realizes there’s a challenge against the UCA defense, which held McNeese to 160 total yards last week. \n“It’s starts up front,” said Woodard. “They rotate a number of defensive linemen and they get those shoulder pads under you and get after you. The big thing is they can apply a lot of pressure with just four guys and that opens up a lot of things. Their linebackers know how to hit and run to the football and their secondary is smart, runs to the ball and are run-stoppers. \n“I like the way their team is built. Their offensive line is aggressive. They line up and bloody your nose. They have a two-headed monster.” \nAnd Woodard hs particular praise for UCA defensive end Jonathan Woodard. \n“I’d take him as a relative,” he said. “He’s not but I’d certainly take him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:04:11.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
