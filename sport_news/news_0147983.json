The move came in response to an executive order last year from President Barack Obama seeking to improve and simplify the nation's immigration system.\nThe bulletin thrilled many of the workers who are here on petitions for employment visas, as it was expected to help clear up a yearslong backlog of applications by immigrants from China and India. Many immediately started preparing to file by getting their paperwork in order, paying lawyers and obtaining required medical exams and vaccinations.\nBut on Sept. 25, the government revised that notice without explanation, severely curtailing who could apply by issuing new and earlier cut-off dates for consideration based on when an application for a green card was filed. The State Department issued no word as to when those left out might be allowed to file.\nShashi Singh Rai, 32, of Gurnee, Illinois, said her husband, a systems engineer at a pharmaceutical company, has had to put off obtaining a master's degree in business administration for the past five years and has had to turn down promotions as he waits for his green card, because his visa petition is job-specific, she said.\nWhen the State Department issued its initial bulletin, she said, they excitedly called their parents in India. The couple spent $600 obtaining their birth certificates, Rai said, but her disappointment wasn't about the money.\n\"All our dreams are on hold for this. We have waited patiently,\" she said. \"We have been just hanging by a thread, and that thread has been cut.\"\nSwaroop Venumbaka, 33, a software engineer in Tysons Corner, Virginia, said he took three days off work to prepare his application and had more than $2,600 in legal and medical bills.\nHe said he hasn't returned to Hyderabad, India, in the past three years because of the complications of traveling without a green card.\nWhen the initial bulletin came down, his immediate thought was about his 6-month-old son. \"I was excited to take him back to my parents and extended family,\" he said.\nNow, he expects his wife to take the boy without him later this year.\nThe federal agency declined to comment Wednesday, saying it does not discuss litigation. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is also named as a defendant, also declined.\nSome immigrants said they might be able to get money back from their lawyers, but the medical exams are only valid for a year.\n\"This case is about what happens when thousands of law-abiding, highly skilled immigrants spend millions of dollars preparing to apply for green cards in reasonable reliance on an agency's binding policy statement, only to find out at the last minute that a hapless federal bureaucracy has abruptly, inexplicably, and arbitrarily reneged on its promise,\" said the lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Seattle.\nThe lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, was filed on behalf of 14 individuals and one organization, the International Medical Graduate Taskforce, which comprises physicians dedicated to placing doctors in rural American communities.\nTheir lawyers - R. Andrew Free, of Nashville, Tennessee; Gregory Siskind, of Memphis, Tennessee; and Robert Pauw of Seattle - estimate 20,000 to 30,000 immigrants were affected by the decision.\nAmong the plaintiffs are Quan Yuan, a Chinese-born math professor at the University of Wisconsin-Stout, and Qi Wang, a Chinese citizen who lives in Superior, Colorado, and works as a research engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the government's main lab for primary laboratory for renewable energy research.\nThe lawyers on Wednesday afternoon requested an emergency order to keep the revised bulletin from taking effect.\nTwo California Democrats, U.S. Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Mike Honda, issued a statement slamming the State Department and asking that it fix the problem. Both represent the Silicon Valley area of California, a tech hotspot.\n\"This revision seriously undermines the stability and predictability of our immigration system,\" they said. \"In a time when this country has to compete harder than ever with the rest of the world for high-skilled workers, a confounding and sudden change such as this is unacceptable.\"\n___\nFollow Johnson at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:44:35.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
