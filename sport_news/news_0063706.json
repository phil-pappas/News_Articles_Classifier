September's drop ended a two-month streak of accelerating sales.\nAmericans' zeal for newly built homes took off this year — yet now appears close to having topped out. Solid hiring over the past three years has improved many family balance sheets, while rising home prices has returned equity to current homeowners now seeking to upgrade to new residential developments. Sales of new homeshave soared 17.6 percent during the first nine months of 2015.\nBut global pressures began to exert a downward pull on economic growth in recent months. Those pressures could be spread to the housing market if the drop in sales of new homes leads to a decline in construction.\n\"A stronger pace of sales will need to be seen for the recent stronger pace of single-family housing starts to be sustained,\" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley.\nJob gains slowed in September, while profit margins for many of the largest U.S. businesses with a global footprint stopped growing. The stronger dollar has punished exports abroad and cheaper oil prices have forced energy firms to cut workers and slash orders for pipeline and equipment.\nThe slowdown has yet to hit sales of existing homes as drastically, but the September pullback in newly built properties was severe.\nPurchases of new homes slid in the Midwest, South and West, but plummeted a stiff 61.8 percent in the Northeast.\nPrices have climbed sharply as well, making new construction less affordable for would-be buyers. The median new-home sales price has jumped 13.5 percent from a year ago to $296,900.\nThe housing market has advanced from the depths of the Great Recession, although it has yet to fully recover from the bursting of the housing bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. Sales of new homes remain below the 52-year historic average of 655,200.\nThe drop in sales increases the supply of new homes on the market. The Commerce Department said 5.8 months' supply of homes were available at the end of September, compared to a scant 4.9 months a month ago.\nStill, inventories are tight across the housing sector. The National Association of Realtors said last week that existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.55 million, advancing 8.8 percent from a year ago. But the number of listings on the market has dropped 3.1 percent during that time.\nOffsetting some of the economic pressures have been relatively low mortgage rates.\nThe rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage averaged just 3.79 percent nationwide last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, far below historical norms.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:17:19.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
