I’m thinking about my lads, how we’re going to play, good technique, good tactics and the stuff you don’t need talent for – which is very big physicality. \n“And trying to get the balance right. If you go one direction too far in any of those things you’ll pay the penalty. \n“We’ve worked are on building our team spirit to be ready for whatever challenge is put in front of us. \n“The only way people who think like that will change their mind is if we show them and give them reason to change their minds.” Stay up to date with the latest sports news Follow our social accounts to get exclusive content and all the latest sporting news!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:52:03.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
