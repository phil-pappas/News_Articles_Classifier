Big E has always looked like a prototype all-star. He has a great-looking moveset , relatable personality, prodigious background as a power lifter and one of the best overall looks in the company -- but he started to drift after he hit the main roster. Big E had solid runs as A.J. Lee’s bodyguard and as Intercontinental Champion, but spent most of 2014 off television entirely. It was the same story for guys like Fandango, Cesaro and Luke Harper -- all talented guys who haven’t quite found consistency in the company. (He’ll be back on TV in a big way on Saturday, wrestling The Dudley Boyz at Hell in a Cell,) That all started to change at the end of 2014 with the creation of The New Day. After a less-than-stellar start, the stable of Kofi Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods has quickly become the best part of Raw every week. They put on great matches sure, but The New Day host a delightfully modern sense of humor that’s been missing from WWE television since… well, ever. These three men have figured out how to be sinister heels with rap jokes and Final Fantasy references, and they’ve ridden that unconventional train to the top of the card.\n• Watch a 100-MPH fastball get cut in half with a samurai sword\nWe recently caught up with Big E to talk about his journey, how he dealt with discouragement, his love of Sasha Banks, and who, if anyone, is funnier than The New Day backstage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:31:56.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
