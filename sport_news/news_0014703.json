LOS ANGELES − Young guns Noah Syndergaard and Jeurys Familia both did something they'd never done − yes, unFamilia in the latter case − to seal the Mets’ first playoff series win since 2006.\nSyndergaard dominated the Dodgers in his first career relief appearance, and Familia notched the first two-inning save in his first year as the team’s closer to send the Mets back home to face the Cubs in the NLCS with a nail-biting 3-2 win over the Dodgers in game 5 of the division series.\nSyndergaard, working on full rest after pitching well but taking the loss in Game 2, warmed up several times in the bullpen with starter Jacob deGrom working in out and out of trouble throughout the early innings.\n\"I got up four times. I think I did a pretty good job of asking the other relievers how to handle that kind of situation and they gave me some good advice and I was just able to keep the body warm and take it one pitch at a time out there,\" Syndergaard said. \"Whatever it took, we got it done.\"\nDeGrom coughed up two runs in the first, but he handed the ball and a 3-2 lead to Syndergaard to start the seventh. Collins had expressed apprehension before the game about using Syndergaard in such a high-leverage situation, but that clearly was a smokescreen.\n\"There was a point in the game where one of the things (pitching coach) Dan (Warthen) said to me, 'look, the middle of their lineup, we need to have somebody with power to get through that part,\" Collins said. \"And I said, do you think the kid can handle it? And he said, ‘by all means’. So he talked me into it. We brought him in the 7th inning, and he was about as good as you can possibly ask for in that spot.\"\nTypically throwing several pitches at 99 or 100 mph, Syndergaard struck out the side and walked one in the seventh, including a whiff of ex-Met Justin Turner − who led all batters with seven hits in the series − for the final out.\nCollins tabbed Matt Harvey to start Saturday's opener against the Cubs, but Syndergaard said he'd be ready to pitch this weekend, likely in Game 2. \"I feel like my body is strong, my arm feels right, whenever they need me,\" Syndergaard said. \"I'm ready to go.\"\nSo was Familia, who only recorded six outs twice this season, with the last coming on June 27.\nView Gallery Mets move on in playoffs, advance to NLCS \"We said, 'if we've got the lead in the 8th inning, we've got to roll the dice,\" Collins said. \"We've got, in my opinion, if he's not the best closer in the National League, he's one of the best closers in all of baseball. You've got to go to him. You can't − you'd be kicking yourself if they scored a run off somebody else when that guy should be in the game in a game like tonight that means everything.\"\nFamilia needed just nine pitches to navigate the eighth inning, and then quickly retired pinch-hitter Chase Utley − the early series villain − in his first plate appearance since breaking Ruben Tejada's leg in Game 2 - − to open the ninth.\nFamilia, who earned the closer role because incumbent Jenrry Mejia was twice suspended for PEDs, struck out A.J. Ellis and Howie Kendrick for the final two outs.\n\"I was so excited. I don't have the words to say how special I feel right now,\" said Familia, who hopped up and down several times while waiting to jump into catcher Travis d'Arnaud's arms. \"I had my mind ready to do it for two innings. TC asked me before the game and I told him anything you need.\n\"I've had veteran people talking to me all year, like Bartolo (Colon), (bullpen coach) Ricky (Bones), Dan Warthen my pitching coach and my teammates, they told me all year they have confidence in me to do the job, and I am glad I could do that today.\"\nRelated Stories MOVING ON!
