And on Saturday evening, less than two hours before North Carolina crushed Wake Forest, Melton informed UNC coach Larry Fedora that he was going to be a Tar Heel. \"I told him around 5:15 I would say and he said he was very excited and he was fired up,\" Melton told THI . \"He also told me that it made his night.\"Melton, a 4-star offensive guard from Mebane, NC, is the first official member of the class of 2017. The 6-4, 290 pounder is rated the No. 2 overall player in North Carolina, the No. 3 player nationally at his position and the No. 75 player nationally overall.He was courted by a bevy of other big-time programs, including Clemson, Miami, Penn State and Virginia Tech. But in the end, his personal feelings for UNC - Melton's grandparents went there and he grew up a Tar Heels fan - and what the program and school have to offer won out.\"They are everything I want in a school,\" he said. Melton, who wants to study Kinesiology, said the current Tar Heels didn't know about his commitment until after the game. Then, they were told in the locker room.\"I went into the locker room after the game and Coach Kap introduced me to some of the O-Line and told them that I had committed,\" Melton said. \"They congratulated me and welcomed me to the family.\"So Melton's recruitment is over, he's a Tar Heel and not looking back.\"I am very excited to be a Tar Heel,\" he said.
