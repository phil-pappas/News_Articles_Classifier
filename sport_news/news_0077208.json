Noonan Stadium. \nOn the possession prior to Troxell’s TD, Hillsborough (1-4) tied the game 7-7 on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Al Fisher to Dylan Zimmerman with 5:48 left in the second quarter. \nP’burg (4-1) immediately embarked on a long drive directed by senior quarterback Ringhoff, who’d just come on in relief of junior Danny Fisher. \nThe Stateliners methodically moved down the field until they faced a second-and-10 on the Hillsborough 12. Ringhoff directed a pass toward Troxell on the right side of the field. Troxell went up for the ball near the goal line and outmuscled Raiders defensive back Charles Amankwaa for the reception before running into the end zone. \nRELATED : QB Zach Ringhoff provides instant relief \nThe pivotal play gave P’burg a 14-7 lead with just 26 seconds left in the first half. \n“That play really wasn’t designed for me,” Troxell said. “I’m not really sure who it was supposed to go to, but I think it was one of the slot receivers. I was just supposed to be a decoy out wide. But Zach put the ball right where it needed to be.” \nTroxell’s night wasn’t finished. Late in the game he turned in an equally big play on the other side of the ball. \nWith P’burg leading 28-21, Hillsborough had momentum and was driving with a first-and-10 on the Stateliners’ 13 midway into the fourth quarter. \nJunior running back Kyle Kauffman, the Raiders’ leading rusher, took the handoff but had the ball knocked out of his grasp. The opportunistic Troxell fell on it at the 15 to end the threat with 5:52 remaining. \n“Somebody, I think it might have been (defensive tackle) Matt Yanes, jarred it loose,” Troxell said. “I saw the ball on the ground and my eyes got real big. I jumped on it and that was how it went. It was a great team play.” \nP’burg then turned to its running game, which was quiet for most of the evening, to run out the clock. Ja’Quan Jones and Manny Romero each had fourth down conversions to keep the drive going. \n“I give a lot of credit to Hillsborough,” Troxell said. “They played tough. But we stuck together and adapted to whatever we needed to do to get the win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:21:40.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
