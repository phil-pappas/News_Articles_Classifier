He is not expected, however, to play Monday at Ohio State or Tuesday at home against the Milwaukee Bucks.\nLove hinted he could play Thursday at home against the Indiana Pacers.\n\"I felt good. Just getting into the rhythm of the plays more than anything, just getting my legs under me and (taking) contact,\" Love said. \"As time goes, I'll get more accustomed to being out there playing, but today was the first step.\"\nAll of these back-to-backs during the preseason have complicated the Cavs' plans. David Blatt said Saturday LeBron James will play in one of the games, either Monday or Tuesday, after James already declared he would play Monday at Ohio State. James has long had an affinity for the school and he enjoys playing preseason games in cities the Cavs don't visit during the regular season.\n(c)2015 Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio)\nVisit the Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio) at www.ohio.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1735841", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1735841&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1735841&h=Cavs%27+Love+practices+for+first+time+since+shoulder+surgery"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:21:11.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
