Eight years ago this week, Kansas welcomed Baylor to Memorial Stadium and won by 48 points. The Bears dreamed of having a program like the Jayhawks’. KU was accused by some of running up the score. \nSaturday marked the official completion of the two teams’ reversal. No. 3 Baylor won, 66-7, after entering as the largest road favorite in Big 12 history (46 points) according to ESPN Stats and Info. \nKU, meanwhile, surrendered 52 points and 425 yards … in the first half alone. It let 6-foot-7, 410-pound tight end LaQuan McGowan run free to the secondary to catch an 18-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. It surrendered 246 first-half passing yards to Seth Russell — a Heisman candidate who originally committed to KU before a coaching change in 2011. \nKU entered the game short-handed, as receivers Tre’ Parmalee (concussion), Bobby Hartzog (right knee), cornerback Brandon Stewart (groin) and defensive end Damani Mosby (left elbow) did not play because of injuries. \nIn his first start, KU freshman quarterback Ryan Willis completed 20 of 36 passes for 158 yards with a touchdown and interception. \nBU (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) finished 644 yards of offense after putting in its second-teamers to start the second half. \nKU (0-5, 0-2) will play host to Texas Tech at 11 a.m. on Oct. 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:16:50.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
