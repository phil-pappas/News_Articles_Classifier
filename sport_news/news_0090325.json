UC led 14-3 midway in the first quarter before Miami rallied and led 20-17 with 11:26 left in the first half.\nUC's fast-paced offense produced a touchdown and field goal in the final 2:17 for a 27-20 halftime lead.\nWhat did we learn: Despite all of the hoopla about the UC offense that averages 40.2 points per game, it was the Bearcats defense that stepped up after playing miserably in a 53-46 loss to Memphis last week.\nMiami's offense averages 42 points per game but the UC defense stepped on several occasions. Defensive tackle Alex Pace, out of Glenville High School, disrupted the Hurricanes offensive line. Linebacker Eric Wilson had 14 tackles. And UC's defensive backs consistently punished Miami's receivers after the catch.\nSafety Tyrell Gilbert provided the biggest play with a pass deflection in the end zone on fourth-and-goal with five minutes left, and UC hanging onto an 11-point lead.\nBackup QB: Moore became the 10th UC QB over the last 107 games to make his first start. UC has won nine of 10 when its QB makes his first start.\nDid you know: This was only the second time UC has defeated Miami in 13 tries. The last time the Bearcats defeated Miami was in 1947.\nCleveland connection: Shaq Washington caught eight passes for 106 yards. Pace had three tackles.\nNext game: Cincinnati (3-2) plays at BYU on Oct. 17. That will be the third straight Thursday game for the Bearcats, all on ESPN. Miami (3-1) plays at Florida State on Oct. 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:55:24.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
