I was asked if I had to do a biopic then on which person it would be, I gave her name (Pakistani singer Nazia Hasan) as it was on top of my mind. I found the story and subject interesting,\" Alia said at a promotional event of her upcoming film Shaandaar.\nThe actress was present to unveil her latest song Raita Phail Gaya along with director Vikas Bahl and co-star Shahid Kapoor. Vikas recounts that he had a great time watching noted actor Pankaj Kapur dance to the song.\n\"When he was asked to dance, it was then difficult to stop him. We were waiting for him to stop. The unit was on floor looking at him,\" he said.\nShahid, who is sharing the screen space for the first time with his father does not have any dance scenes with him.\n\"The situation in the song is when I am around he is not dancing since we have ' tashan ' in the film. When I go away he dances alone as he also wants to dance. I did not get chance to dance with him,\" Shahid said.\nAt the event, Shahid also came to the rescue of Alia when reporters asked her if she had seen pictures posted by her rumoured boyfriend Siddharth Malhotra on social networking sites regarding New Zealand tourism, of which he is the brand ambassador in India.\nTo this Alia said, \"Shahid I always rescue you, today you have to rescue me.\"\nHer Shaandaar co-star then got up and said, \"Who is Siddharth, we don't know any Siddharth. There is Sid (Siddharth) Marketing. He handles marketing of Dharma Productions. Apart from him we don't know any Siddharth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:06:00.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
