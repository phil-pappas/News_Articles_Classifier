Last week's bye came at a good time for him. \n\"It was a good chance to heal up and just relax a little bit,\" Murray said this week. \"I wouldn't say (I'm) 100 percent, but I feel good and I will be playing and will be participating fully.\" Oakland Raiders' Latavius Murray (28) runs against Baltimore Ravens' C.J. Mosley (57) in the second quarter at the O.co Coliseum in Oakland, Calif., on Sunday, Sept. 20, 2015. (Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nMurray was a full-go in every Raiders practice this week and Oakland (2-3) needs him to recapture his form from Week 3, when he rushed for 139 yards and a touchdown in a 27-20 win at Cleveland. The Raiders haven't won since then, losing to the Chicago Bears (22-20) and Denver Broncos (16-10). \nMurray injured his shoulder a week later in Chicago on an afternoon in which he wasn't formally charged with a turnover, but was involved in two. He had a ball bounce off his hands for an interception and he dropped a pitch for a fumble that was charged to quarterback Derek Carr. Murray, a third-year pro out of Central Florida, tried to play through the injury two weeks ago against Denver, but managed only two second-half carries before spending the rest of the game on the sideline.

But as explosive as San Diego's offense is, the Chargers defense may present a favorable matchup for the Raiders, especially with Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle out with a groin injury. \nSan Diego is last in the AFC against the run, giving up 132.5 yards per game. The team just above the Chargers? Those Browns that Murray and the Raiders torched a month ago in the only road win in Carr's 21-game career. \n\"They bring a lot of different looks and maybe a misfit here or there makes those run numbers not look so good,\" Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said. \"It's a good defense. They are very good on third down getting off the field. That's definitely an area we've got to make sure we're staying ahead of the chains and not getting ourselves in third-and-forever.\" \nThe Raiders aren't bringing more focus to the run game this week, according to Murray. \n\"We want to establish the run every week,\" he said. \"I think that's the most important thing, regardless of who we're facing. We just know we need to run the ball to be successful.\" \nThe Raiders have another option this week if Murray isn't at full strength. Taiwan Jones is back after missing two games with a foot injury. \nSunday could mark the first time all five Raiders running backs (with fullbacks Marcel Reece and Jamize Olawale included) are active this season. Roy Helu was a healthy inactive for the opener, Olawale missed the next two with an ankle injury and then Jones missed a pair. \nIt should rate as no surprise that Carr's highest-rated game of the season, against Cleveland, came when the running game was rolling. That also was rookie Amari Cooper's biggest receiving output; eight catches for 134 yards. \nThe Raiders understand keeping Cooper involved is hugely important to their offense. He was targeted just four times in the loss to Denver after receiving a minimum of nine targets the previous four games. He also has been much more active in the first half of games (18 catches for 311 yards) than the second half (10 for 75). \nCarr said during the bye week that he'll leave it up to the coaches to get Cooper more involved. \n\"I'm going to just continue to do my reads the best I can, see the coverage, because you never want to force it,\" Carr said. \nDel Rio sounded open to forcing the game plan to better feature the team's No. 4 overall pick. \n\"We want to make sure we're keeping our key people involved,\" Del Rio said. \"We're not going to do anything crazy. I think the 'read' just took it away from him on a few occasions. But certainly there are opportunities to make sure the guy stays involved and we'll look to make sure that happens.\" \n-- Defensive end Shelby Harris was moved to the active roster from the practice squad, the Raiders announced. He was originally a seventh-round pick by the Raiders in the 2014 draft and played in one game last season. To make room for Harris, the Raiders waived safety Tevin McDonald.
