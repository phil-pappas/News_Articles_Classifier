The Bengals (4-0) matched the third-best start in franchise history, two wins shy of the club record. Dalton completed 17 of 24 for 321 yards with the long touchdown pass to Brandon Tate during a scramble. Alex Smith was sacked five times, the Chiefs (1-3) settled for Cairo Santos’ club-record seven field goals, and the defense couldn’t keep up with another one of the NFL’s top passers. \nJets 27, Dolphins 14 \nLONDON \nChris Ivory ran for a career-high 166 yards and Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for 218, one touchdown and one interception to lead the Jets at Wembley Stadium in the first division game played in London. “When the back is going good, you keep feeding him,” Jets head coach Todd Bowles said. Miami’s Ndamukong Suh, the highest-paid defensive player in league history, had three tackles — the first in the third quarter — and no sacks. Both teams have byes next week, as usual for teams playing in London. Miami (1-3) will face lots of questions about its poor performances thus far. Fitzpatrick threw for 172 yards in the first half, including a 58-yard completion to Brandon Marshall on the first play for the Jets (3-1). “We play aggressive, so some of that’s going to happen,” Jets linebacker Calvin Pace said. “But we know we’ve got to clean up our play.” \nColts 16, Jaguars 13, OT \nINDIANAPOLIS \nAdam Vinatieri kicked a 27-yard field goal with 4:36 left in overtime to give Indianapolis an NFL record-tying 15th consecutive win over a division opponent. The 1972-73 Miami Dolphins also win 15 straight. Matt Hasselbeck made his first start since November 2012 in place of the injured Andrew Luck, and led the Colts (2-2) on a 53-yard march to step up the winning points. The Jaguars (1-3) lined up twice for field goals with 6 seconds left in regulation, but Jason Myers’ first attempt from 53 yards sailed wide right — just after the Colts had called timeout. Myers’ second chance also went wide right. Then in overtime, his 48-yard attempt went wide left. \nNFC \nRams 24, Cardinals 22 \nGLENDALE, Ariz. \nTodd Gurley rushed for all but 2 of 146 yards in the second half and the Rams held on to hand the Cardinals their first loss of the season. Gurley, the Rams’ first-round draft pick, saw his most extensive action as a pro and his 52-yard run set up the winning touchdown. Nick Foles threw for three touchdowns, two after Arizona turnovers, and St. Louis’ defense held the Cardinals (3-1) to field goals on four of five trips inside the red zone. Arizona had a third-and-2 at the Rams 43 in the final minutes, but Carson Palmer overthrew receivers on consecutive plays to turn the ball over on downs. The Rams (2-2) are 2-0 against the NFC West. \nPanthers 37, Buccaneers 23 \nTAMPA, FLA. \nCam Newton threw for two touchdowns and Josh Norman returned one of Carolina’s four interceptions of Jameis Winston for his second TD of the season. Newton tossed scoring passes of 6 and 12 yards to Ted Ginn Jr. A week after making a game-saving interception in the end zone against New Orleans, Norman scored on a 46-yard run back and later returned a another pick 34 yards to set up a second TD. The Panthers improved to 4-0 for the first time since 2003. The Bucs (1-3) have dropped 11 consecutive home games. \nRedskins 23, Eagles 20 \nLANDOVER, MD. \nKirk Cousins threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon with 26 seconds left for Washington. Starting at their own 10 with a little more than six minutes remaining, the Redskins (2-2) drove 90 yards on 15 plays to take the lead for good in a back-and-forth game. Cousins finished 31 for 46 for 290 yards and no turnovers. Sam Bradford threw three second-half touchdown passes for the Eagles (1-3), but their new kicker, Caleb Sturgis, missed an extra-point attempt and a 33-yard field-goal try. \nINTERCONFERENCE \nFalcons 48, Texans 21 \nATLANTA \nDevonta Freeman scored three touchdowns and the Atlanta Falcons remained unbeaten. Freeman, who took over as the starting running back after rookie Tevin Coleman sustained a rib injury in Week 2, has scored six TDs in the last two games. The Falcons improved to 4-0 for only the fourth time in club history. Freeman had touchdown runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards. He set up another score with a 44-yard reception. Nothing went right for the Texans (1-3). Quarterback Ryan Mallett was yanked after the Falcons built a 42-0 lead. Running back Arian Foster made his season debut after tearing his groin early in training camp, but he couldn’t find room to run. He even had the ball knocked out of his hands by one of his own teammates, leading to a Falcons touchdown. \nBroncos 23, Vikings 20 \nDENVER \nBrandon McManus kicked a 39-yard field goal with 1:51 left and Denver had seven sacks. Von Miller smothered the loose ball after T.J. Ward’s sack-strip of Teddy Bridgewater in the closing seconds, sealing the win for the unbeaten Broncos (4-0), who got a 72-yard touchdown run from Ronnie Hillman. “We had three bad weeks of running the ball and tonight we got it started,” Hillman said after his third career 100-yard game. “This week it was just me and C.J. [Anderson] got tired of everyone trying to tell us that we can’t run the ball.”Peyton Manning has led his teams to a 4-0 start seven times, most in NFL history by a long shot. Next up at four is Fran Tarkenton. Manning also joined Brett Favre as the only QBs to win 100 home starts in the NFL. It wasn’t a great day for Manning, who was picked off twice by the Vikings (2-2). Adrian Peterson ran for a 48-yard touchdown to pull Minnesota to 20-17 and cap a 97-yard drive with 10 minutes left. \nBears 22, Raiders 20 \nCHICAGO \nJay Cutler threw for two touchdowns and redeemed himself following an interception by helping set up a 49-yard field goal by Robbie Gould with 2 seconds left for Chicago. It was the Bears’ first win under coach John Fox. The Raiders (2-2) grabbed the lead on a field goal by Sebastian Janikowski with just over two minutes remaining that was set up by an interception by Charles Woodson deep in Oakland territory. Cutler then led Chicago (1-3) from its 20 to the Oakland 32 before Gould nailed the winner. \nGiants 24, Bills 10 \nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. \nRashad Jennings broke three tackles to score on a 51-yard touchdown catch midway through the fourth quarter for New York. “We were challenged after the first two games where we had leads going into the fourth quarter and lost them both,” quarterback Eli Manning said. “So that was a huge play by Rashad. A great effort and we need it. The team needed it.” Manning went 20 of 35 for 212 yards and three touchdowns for the Giants (2-2). New York’s defense did the rest with Prince Amukamara stripping receiver Robert Woods of the ball to force a fumble with 3:41 left. The Bills (2-2) were called for 17 penalties totaling 135 yards. “Can we play a lot smarter? Absolutely,” coach Rex Ryan said. “Say what you want, but I’ll take a team that will fight.” \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:40:55.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
