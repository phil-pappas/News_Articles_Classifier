Image 8 of 8 E-N Game of the Week: (3) Sam Houston vs. (9) Highlands 1 / 8 Back to Gallery Sam Houston vs. Highlands\nKickoff: 7 p.m. Thursday, Alamo Stadium\nRadio: Internet only (TSRNSports.com)\nE-N Area rankings/records: Sub-6A No. 3 Sam Houston (6-0, 4-0 District 28-5A); Sub-6A No. 9 Highlands (4-1, 3-0 district)\nCoaches: Patrick Brown (6-0 at Sam Houston, first season; 31-11 overall, four seasons); Juan Morales (4-1 at Highlands, first year as a head coach)\nSeries: Sam Houston leads 25-16-2.\nLast meeting: Sam Houston won 48-0 in 2014.\nSam Houston breakdown\nSetting the scene: The Hurricanes play their second straight Thursday night contest. Sam Houston is coming off a 32-14 victory over Brackenridge to set up a critical district matchup with Highlands. A win over the Owls would not only give Sam Houston the inside track to the 28-5A title, but it could end up deciding playoff seeding.\nKey to victory: Unlike last year’s game, the Hurricanes should have more of a problem with the Owls. Sam Houston will need to slow Highlands senior running Armando Ferguson , who is averaging 6.79 yards per carry. Sam Houston will try to keep Highlands senior defensive back Nick Mendoza from padding his team-high total of three interceptions.\nStatistical leaders: Passing — Raymonte Prime 88-126-3, 1,723 yards, 26 TDs; rushing — Devin Harris 52-426, 6 TDs; receiving — Jawon Anderson 19-502, 8 TDs.\nHighlands breakdown\nSetting the scene: One year after a winless season, the Owls have turned it around under first-year coach Juan Morales. Morales, formerly a Brennan assistant, has helped Highlands remain in contention for a district title. After a Week 2 loss to Uvalde, the Owls have won three straight. Highlands topped Lanier 30-14 last week to set up Thursday’s District 28-5A showdown.\nKey to victory: Morales’ bunch will have to contain the Hurricanes’ explosive athletes. Sam Houston senior quarterback Raymonte Prime and junior wide receiver Jawon Anderson showed big-play potential last week against Brackenridge. The Hurricanes’ defensive line also pressured Eagles quarterback Antonio Lopez all game, led by sophomore Garland Coleman ’s six sacks.\nStatistical leaders: Passing — Dylan Camacho 19-51-4, 378 yards, 7 TDs; rushing — Armando Ferguson 67-455, 5 TDs; receiving — Richard Saldana 11-252, 5 TDs.\nE-N prediction\nSam Houston 30, Highlands 26: The Hurricanes could be in for their toughest test during district play and should squeak past the Owls to keep alive the dream of a perfect regular season.\nBen Baby", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/11/13/8688375/49/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/11/13/8688365/49/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/11/13/8688363/49/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/60/21/8586321/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/34/8726318/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/11/13/8688365/49/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/11/13/8688352/51/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/11/13/8688375/49/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/34/8726318/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/11/13/8688352/51/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/60/21/8586321/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/34/8726328/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/34/8726328/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/11/13/8688363/49/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:59:11.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
