It makes you gulp, plus appreciate that you can walk upright on two legs as you watched the graphic leg injuries of former Louisville Cardinals guard Kevin Ware , Indiana Pacers All-Star guard Paul George , and recently the Russian MMA fighter who broke his own leg for all to eerily witness on live television.\nNow this is sadly the same case for Georgia Bulldogs running back Nick Chubb . On the first play of the game versus Tennessee, Chubb ran the ball to the sidelines, and landed unnaturally on his left leg. He was carted off the field for his potential season-ending knee injury. To warn you, the video of his injury is pretty graphic.\nThis is a moment in which you wish Chubb was as flexible as Gumby. We wish Nick Chubb a speedy recovery.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com\n[via Twitter]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:53:40.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
