The argument was these destroy the moral fabric of society. The ban rendered about 75,000 bar dancers and close to one lakh related service providers jobless. Most dancers were illiterate migrants. The fully-clad dancers used to provide entertainment by dancing on Bollywood numbers to patrons who watched them from a distance and offered currency notes as a gesture of appreciation. Following the ban, the Maharashtra government promised rehabilitation only for the girls who belonged to Maharashtra, but the promised help never materialised. Penniless, unemployed, these dancers were pushed into prostitution, some committed suicide, while some others became victims of human trafficking. Ironically, politicians and law enforcers both claim the moral satisfaction of having protected the dignity of women. The Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association fought a protracted legal battle with the state government. With the Supreme Court's stay on the 2005 ban, the bars may soon come back to life. The stay comes with a rider that performances should not be obscene. This gives the licence providers and law enforcers power to misuse the well-meaning court order. The government's position has not changed despite a change in the ruling party. Chief Minister Fadnavis say they will press for continuance of the ban. The Bombay High Court had quashed the government's decision and declared the provision as unconstitutional, violating Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution which allows the citizens the right to practise any profession. But the state government moved the apex court in 2006. Despite Supreme Court upholding the High Court's verdict, in 2014 the state government passed Maharashtra Police (Second Amendment) Bill which put a blanket ban on all dance performances. Ironically, the state government allows Bollywood to produce raunchy item numbers, perhaps because it earns millions in revenue from films. It should leave it to the people to decide whether they want to visit a bar or how they wish to earn their livelihood. No government should arrogate to itself the right to prescribe or proscribe morals for society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:12:27.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
