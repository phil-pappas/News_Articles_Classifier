On Friday, the junior paced the Crusaders with 18 kills at Cleveland State. \nSaturday then saw Campbell help lead Valpo to a come-from-behind five-set win at Youngstown State. With her fourth kill of the match, Campbell became the 14th player in Crusader history to reach 1,000 career kills. Then, entering set four trailing two sets to one, the junior stepped up for Valpo, tallying 13 kills over the final two sets on .619 hitting. Fittingly, it was Campbell who ended the match with a kill – her 25th of the match, tying her career high set last month against UIC. \nFor the week, Campbell averaged 4.38 kills/set on .321 hitting on the attack. She also posted a new career high with five service aces against the Penguins and added 22 digs for a double-double. Campbell and the rest of the Crusaders return to action Wednesday night at the ARC for a non-league matchup with IPFW at 6 p.m. \nNico Campbell Earns Second Weekly Honor of the Year For the second time this season, Valparaiso University junior goalkeeper Nico Campbell (Kingston, Jamaica/St. George’s College) has been tabbed the Horizon League Defensive Player of the Week. \nAfter surrendering a goal 35 seconds into the Crusaders’ match at #23 New Mexico, Campbell went the final 219:25 of the pair of Valpo contests last week without giving up a goal. The junior made a pair of saves and commanded his area well throughout the Crusaders’ draw at New Mexico as the team earned its third straight result against a nationally-ranked foe. For Campbell, over four matches against top-25 teams that year, he surrendered just three goals and posted a 0.69 GAA. \nCampbell followed the draw of the Lobos with another stellar effort Saturday at Northern Kentucky. The junior backstopped the Crusaders to another clean sheet within Horizon League play – their fourth in five league matches this season. Campbell now has posted seven shutouts on the year, tied for second-most in a single season in program history. \nWebb and Magoline Sit In Top Ten After Day One at Dayton The Valparaiso University men’s golf team set out for its final golf outing of the 2015 fall season in Kettering, Ohio on Monday afternoon. The Crusaders ended round one of the two-day, 36-hole Dayton Flyer Invitational at NCR Country Club tied for sixth. \n“NCR is a tremendous golf course and one of the best that we play, all year,” said Crusader head coach David Gring. “The greens were running at a 13 today and the course was very firm and fast. It was a great test for our guys and I felt that we really started getting a good feel for the speed of the course, especially during the last nine holes.” \nAfter starting Monday morning with a one hour delay due to frost on the course, the Crusaders did not let the cold bother them, as they shot a 312 on the par-71 course. The 312 is good for a sixth-place tie with Evansville, just five shots back from second place and nine from first-place Oakland. \nJunior Peter Webb (Madison, Wis./James Madison Memorial) continues to impress, shooting a round-one score of 74 (+3) to end the day tied for third place individually. Just one stroke behind Webb sits senior Jared Magoline (Fond du Lac, Wis./Fond du Lac [Marquette]), who shot an opening-round 75 (+4), tying him for seventh. \n“Pete and Jared played very solid all day today,” said Gring. “Jared led the field in par-4 scoring and both of the guys had three birdies each. The guys started a little slow, but got a good feel for the course and finished well. When you look at the firmness of the fairways and greens, along with some wind, their scores were tremendous under those conditions.” \nFreshman Mitchell Wittmann (Kaukauna, Wis./Kaukauna) shot an 81 for the opening round, placing him one stroke ahead of junior Nick Seitz (Xenia, Oh./Carroll), who finished with an 82. Rounding out the Crusader team was sophomore Zach Cutler (O'Fallon, Mo./Timberland), who shot an 85 over the opening 18 holes. \nSeniors Matt Ward (Plainfield, Ill./South) and Michael Holevas (Elgin, Ill./St. Edward Central Catholic) are also hitting the links in Ohio playing as individuals, posting first-round scores of 79 and 84, respectively. Ward is currently tied for 43rd. \n“We struggled with our par-3 and par-5 scoring all day,” said Gring. “We have some adjustments that we will make tomorrow and I feel that we can play those holes a lot better. If we tighten that up well tomorrow, we have another opportunity to finish strong and make a run at winning the tournament.” \nThe Crusaders will close out the fall season tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. CT.

The Michigan coach referred to us before the game as ‘the most resilient team in college soccer’, and he may just be right. In the past six days we've traveled about 4,000 miles, been in three time zones, played three difficult games with two of those going through extra time, and despite it all, we are still heading in a positive direction.” \nThe Crusaders (6-4-4, 2-1-2) withstood pressure from Michigan in the first half, going into halftime tied 0-0 despite surrendering 13 shots over the opening 45 minutes. But the Wolverines (7-3-3) opened up the second half fast, scoring in the 51st minute off the foot of Francis Atuahene. The Crusaders had a few opportunities late, including a shot on goal off a header from junior Matthew Gweh (Apple Valley, Minn./Eastview [High Point]) in the 82nd minute that was saved by Michigan goalkeeper Evan Loudo. Valpo had three shot attempts in the final four minutes as well in search of the equalizer, but could not find it. \nReigning Horizon League Defensive Player of the Week Nico Campbell (Kingston, Jamaica/St. George’s College) faced six shots in goal for the Crusaders on the night, making saves on five of them. \n“The schedule has been challenging, for sure, but we are an ambitious program and we accept that with our ambition will come challenges,” said Avery. “The beauty now is we get a few days off and we have two home games in line. We have four league games remaining, with everything we want still out there in front of us, and we have some amazing experiences to look back on that should harden us for the stretch run.” \nThe match against Michigan closed out the Crusaders’ non-league schedule. Valparaiso has four Horizon League games remaining, including three at home. The next two games will be at Brown Field, starting with Belmont on Saturday night at 7 p.m. Live stats can followed online via ValpoAthletics.com. \nCrusaders Close Out Fall Season at Dayton Invitational The Valparaiso University men’s golf team closed out the 2015 fall season in Kettering, Ohio on Tuesday afternoon. The Crusaders finished tied for ninth place after round two of the 36-hole Dayton Flyer Invitational at the NCR Country Club. \nAfter shooting a 312 on Monday, the Crusaders came back Tuesday shooting one stroke better, finishing round two with a 311. Their total score of 623 tied them with Loyola for ninth place, just nine strokes back from sixth position. Detroit won the tournament, shooting a combined team score of 598. \nJunior Peter Webb (Madison, Wis./James Madison Memorial) continued to lead Valpo, after shooting a round two score of 75 (+4). Webb’s total score of 149 (+7) tied him for sixth place individually. Five strokes behind Webb finished senior Jared Magoline (Fond du Lac, Wis./Fond du Lac [Marquette]), who shot a round two score of 79 (+8) to give him a total score of 154, tied for 26th overall. \nFreshman Mitchell Wittmann (Kaukauna, Wis./Kaukauna) and junior Nick Seitz (Xenia, Oh./Carrol) both finished tied for 61st overall with scores of 160. Rounding out the Crusader club score was sophomore Zach Cutler (O'Fallon, Mo./Timberland), who posted a two-day score of 167. \nSeniors Matt Ward (Plainfield, Ill./South), who shot 161 for the 36 holes, and Michael Holevas (Elgin, Ill./St. Edward Central Catholic), who posted a 169, closed out the fall season playing as individuals. \nThe Dayton Invitational closes out the 2015 fall season for the Crusader men’s golf team, who will kick off the 2016 spring season March 7-8 at the Bash at the Beach in North Myrtle Beach, S.C.
