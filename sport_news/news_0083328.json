Clearly, Arkansas State will come out at home with an appetite for vengeance. Coach Hudspeth noticed a significant change in their defense this season too. \n“They’ve got more people at the point of attack,” Hudspeth said. The increased pressure leads to quick throws, and Arkansas State’s secondary is one of the best in the nation at picking off the ball (tied for first with 13 INT’s). Hudspeth added, “Luckily for us, we don’t throw it 45 times a game.” \nHudspeth can take care of the X’s and O’s at practice, but he will have to deal with a lot of external factors with the midweek game. \nAsking a coach to shift their schedule is typically a setup for a hard “NO,” but not in this case. Coach Hud and crew have made a habit out of shaking up their routine and going to work on a Tuesday night. Clearly, it’s not a Saturday, but playing on ESPN2 in the middle of the week has its pros to outweigh the cons. \n“When you play on Tuesday, you have the whole table,” Hudspeth said. \nWith the table cleared and set, can the Cajuns feast like they did last season? If so, we could see a lot of touchdowns on a Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:44:13.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
