Zimbabwe, on the other hand, are looking for their first win against Pakistan in any format of cricket in three years. \nThe last time a Zimbabwe team defeated a side from Pakistan came in an ODI match on August 29, 2013 when Zimbabwe — hosting the series then as they are now in 2015 — held on for a seven wicket victory after chasing down a target of 245. \nBefore that victory, Zimbabwe had not defeated Pakistan in a single match in any format since 1995. This year, the teams played two T20 matches and two ODIs in Pakistan in May, as well as a single ODI as part of the Cricket World Cup in Australia in March. Pakistan won all of those matches, and then Pakistan also won the two T20 games played in Zimbabwe over the past week. \nTo find out how to watch the Zimbabwe vs, Pakistan First ODI match live online, see the streaming info at the bottom of this article. The match gets underway at 9:30 a.m. at Harare Sports Club in the Zimbabwe capital city of Harare on Thursday, October 1. \nFans in Pakistan and India can log in to the live stream at 12:30 p.m., while United States viewers can watch the ODI match live online starting at 3:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, 12:30 Pacific. \nWhen Zimbabwe played a three-ODI series at home against India in July, they lost all three matches, and though the Africans appear to be putting up credible performances against more powerful — and better financed — teams, the frustration of losing appears to be setting in . \n“Everyone is hurting. We want to improve quickly,” said Zimbabwe all-rounder Chambu Chibhabha after the team’s loss in the first T20 this week. “We don’t want to be the same sort of players that always get close but don’t win matches.” \nPakistan T20 Captain Shahid Afridi, who led his team to a pair of convincing victories in the T20 series, will not be called up for the ODI series. Bowler Imran Khan will also be rested. But Zimbabwe will not be happy to see more of Imad Wasim, Sohail Tanvir and Wahab Riaz who dominated in the T20 series and are likely to continue on the same track in the ODI series. \nIndia-based website CricHD will stream the First Zimbabwe vs. Pakistan ODI at this link , but fans who choose that option will have to put up with numerous advertisements that often cause slowdowns when viewing online. The best way to watch the final Zimbabwe vs. Pakistan cricket match live online in the United States is through Willow TV, which is available via this YouTube link with a monthly subscription fee, as well as on Willow TV’s own site, accessible by clicking here . \nBut there are legal ways to watch Willow TV for free.
