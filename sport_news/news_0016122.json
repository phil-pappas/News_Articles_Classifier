Bouchard has filed a lawsuit against the United States Tennis Association on Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2015, after she fell in a locker room during the U.S. Open. She claimed that the fall, caused by a “slippery, foreign and dangerous substance” on the floor resulted in a severe head injury, which caused her to withdraw from the tournament. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) \nThe 21-year-old Bouchard had just played in a mixed doubles match after earlier defeating Dominika Cibulkova when she returned to the locker room at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens shortly after 10 p.m. Minutes later, she slipped and fell on the tile floor of a physiotherapy room that is inside the locker room, slamming her head against the ground. \nThe fall left Bouchard with a concussion and \"serious head injury.\" She later withdrew from the U.S. Open and tournaments in China and Japan. \n\"Ms. Bouchard entered the physiotherapy room of the women's locker room when she was caused to slip and fall by a slippery, foreign and dangerous substance on the floor,\" the suit says. The substance was not identified in court papers.
