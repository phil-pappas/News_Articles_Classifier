John Hickenlooper block diversion of more water.\nThe Colorado Water Plan , 30 months in the making, spells out how the state intends to supply water for the 10 million people projected to live in the state by 2050. Hickenlooper has ordered the Colorado Water Conservation Board to complete the plan by Dec. 10.\nAdvertisement Colorado Springs lambasted it as \"guardrails without a road\" — a list of what Colorado must not do — and said it was biased against cities and failed to direct action to meet growing needs.\nSprings utilities officials issued a 14-page critique demanding corrections to secure city support, asserting that \"one or more new transmountain diversions will ultimately need to be constructed to address Colorado's water-supply gap.\" The plan \"should include an affirmative statement that it is state policy to develop additional storage.\"\nFront Range cities already divert about 163 billion gallons a year from the west side of the Continental Divide. The diversions deplete waterways, including the Colorado River, increasingly coveted by 40 million people.\nThe state's chief planner said in a Denver Post interview that 46 staffers are scrambling to fix the plan and include a massive new commitment for new reservoir storage of 130 billion gallons.\nThat's equal to what planners propose to gain from city water-saving, such as less watering of lawns.\nBut there's still no consensus over where water to fill new reservoirs would come from to meet a projected 2050 annual shortfall of 163 billion gallons.\nTarryall Reservoir ( Andy Cross/The Denver Post ) Aurora shares some of Colorado Springs' concerns about lining up sufficient supplies and storage, Aurora Water director Marshall Brown said. It also is disappointed the plan emphasizes urban conservation when agriculture uses 85 percent of water statewide, Brown said.\n\"We're still committed to making progress on conservation, but that progress isn't going to be enough to solve the water deficit,\" he said.\nThe Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District also urged state planners to make changes, contending increased diversion from the Western Slope \"has got to be on the table,\" spokesman Brian Werner said. New reservoirs are essential, he said.\nDenver Water manager Jim Lochhead favored \"a more specific action plan\" from the state, adding that Denver is optimistic a final plan will help meet water challenges.\nMeanwhile, 1,500 western Colorado residents petitioned Hickenlooper, opposing more siphoning to Front Range cities and suburbs.\n\"That water's our livelihood. Our ranchers use it. Farmers use it. We use it for recreation, tourism,\" said Silt Mayor Bryan Fleming. \"We stand together. We cannot afford to lose any more water on this side of the mountains. We understand they have water issues, but we need to come to a comprehensive plan with conservation. We need to watch building, and developers should have to secure water before building.\"\nA Colorado Water Plan lacking support from Front Range cities and suburbs, where 80 percent of the state's 5.3 million people live, could be hard to implement, forcing state lawmakers to try to manage water scarcity.\nColorado Water Conservation Board director James Eklund said he's aware of Front Range cities' objections and acknowledged the current plan contains no target for increased reservoir storage.\n\"We're going to correct that,\" he said. \"We're going to add a storage goal, a measurable objective.\"\nEnsuring new storage space to hold 130 billion gallons would address \"a huge chunk of the gap\" between water expected to be available and expanded demands, Eklund said.\nThe final plan will offer general principles for diverting water — such as addressing environmental needs — but won't commit to a specific diversion project.\nFront Range leaders \"know that we're not just going to come out and write the Colorado Springs or Denver water plan. They get that,\" Eklund said. \"For something statewide like this, we've got to make sure we're striking a balance so that this is really, truly Colorado's water plan.\"\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or @finleybruce", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1021/20151021__CD09WATER_AC19647x~p1_300.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:01:20.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
