All season, the Bills' top cornerback has shut down opposing teams' top option in the passing game and done so quietly.\nAmong Gilmore's victims have been Andre Johnson, T.Y. Hilton, A.J. Green and Odell Beckham Jr. Gilmore went as far as to call Beckham average after the Bills held him under 40 yards receiving.\nWhen the Bills lost to the Jaguars 34-31 on Sunday at Wembley Stadium in London, a top receiver finally broke free against Buffalo's secondary. Allen Robinson caught six passes for 98 yards and a touchdown on nine targets. The touchdown was against Gilmore, and Robinson made a few other big plays down the field.\nAsked after the game what makes Robinson tough to guard, Gilmore shot that idea down.\n\"He wasn't really tough to guard if you watch the film,\" Gilmore said. \"He caught, I don't know how many passes. He wasn't tough to guard. If you watch the film it will tell you that.\"\nWhere, then, does Robinson stack up? Gilmore has seen the best receivers in the league this season, and Robinson put up more yards against the Bills than any of them.\n\"He's OK,\" Gilmore said. \"He's an NFL receiver. Average.\"", "external_links":
