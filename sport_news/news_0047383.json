But the young Warrensburg (3-4) team has been keeping pace thanks to Friday's win, thanks to scoring 39.9 points a game this year. \nScott Godfrey is in his third year at Warrensburg and has a 9-16 record. \nQ: You've talked about establishing a winning mentality at Warrensburg. Does Friday's close, high-scoring win bring you closer? \nA: I think that we're getting there. I think with this year especially, our attitudes are beginning to change -- we're just so young. Youngest team I've been around in terms of how many young guys that are playing. And they're doing what's expected of them, they just have to learn how to win. I think the culture is beginning to change in terms of the expectations of the players. \nQ: Do you feel you have to reteach that, considering how young they are? \nA: I think you do. I think when you're playing freshmen and sophomores, you don't have that same sense of urgency maybe as a senior would, as if there was no tomorrow. I think you have to kind of remind those guys, you need to expect to win, and nothing's guaranteed. \nQ: Give me the season review through seven weeks. \nA: It's been really exciting and really frustrating at the same time. Coming in, we knew we would be young and turned out we would be a little younger than we thought. We started as many as four freshmen and four sophomores each week, so we knew we would have games where we had the talent where we played well. But at the same time, we knew there'd be games where they played like freshman and sophomores. \nComing in, we weren't really sure what to expect, and after Week 1 where we're in a game that's a playoff team, it just confirmed that we could play with teams. The Sullivan and the Central A&M games, I thought we came out really flat and played like a JV team. \nSo, it's been exciting because our offense has been exciting. It's been easier for those young guys to adapt offensively than defensively. Each week, it's exciting because we know we're going to score points, but a little frustrating defensively when we have guys that are just a step slow or a couple pounds light. \nQ: We've seen Dionte Lewis have big games rushing the ball. Then he sets the record at receiver -- how versatile is he? \nA: Him and his brother both are unbelievably versatile. I'm been telling everybody this week who's calling about his yards, these kids have only been playing for a year. When they started playing last year as freshmen, they didn't know any rules or any of the positions. They were completely new to football. They've come such a long ways in a year, it's remarkable. \nDionte, we saw a matchup with Clinton, just took him out of the backfield and ran an empty set to get him matched up on a linebacker. We never in a million years thought it would be 364 yards of receiving. We just thought we'd be able to steal one here and get a big play. \nQ: With a young team, where have you received leadership to keep focused? \nA: I go back to our leadership up front -- Friday night we had two seniors and two freshmen (A.J. Speasl and David Chalmers) on the offensive line. And those two seniors bring a lot of leadership, A.J. Duff and Gabe Kent. They've been playing longer than I've had the job -- they were both two-way starters as sophomores when I came in. \nAnd Jacob Napier's done a great job for it being his first year at quarterback. He played receiver for us last year. Those three have done a great job in bringing along a bunch of young guys. \nWe've been starting three (freshmen) at least every week of the season and Speasl's been a two-way starter for us. Mitchell Leathers has taken every snap on defense, Jathan Thompson's played linebacker for the entire season. And Chalmers started on both the offensive and defensive sides, he's bounced back and forth. \nQ: A couple of tough games to close out the season, starting with Tuscola this week. What are you looking for from your team? \nA: I want to see us improve and fight against teams everybody expects to beat us. I tell our guys all the time, I don't care if they're the only one, I want us to believe every week and fight for four quarters. And if they're better than us, we'll tip our hat to them. \nI just want to see these guys not get caught up in the No. 1 team in the state, or that they're young. I want to come out and give it their all and let's see where at. \nadow@herald-review.com|(217) 421-6978", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:48:06.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
