It’s a natural next step to want to explore ways to preserve the art and the stories for loved ones.”\nFor a fee, NAPSA says it will preserve your tattoos through a chemical process that produces non-toxic pieces safe to handle. NAPSA will provide your children, grandchildren and others you designate as beneficiaries pieces of you in ornate frames they can display on the walls of their homes.\nSeveral people have signed up since NAPSA began Sept. 18, but no one has died yet, NAPSA’s Michelle Venorsky told the Huffington Post .\nPreserving tattoos as artwork after death did not surprise Mike Martin, president of the Alliance of Professional Tattooists , a non-profit organization that addresses the health and safety issues facing the tattoo industry.\n“The way I see it is another way to exploit the tattoo industry and make money on our skins,” Martin said in an emailed statement.”It doesn’t surprise me at all, and in a way I think it is a cool idea.\n“I wonder what regulations would be involved. I’m sure there will be issues with bloodborne pathogens and biohazard waste handling from state to state. It’s outta the box thinking for sure.”\nTo have your tattoos turned into fine art, you'll need someone to move quickly after you start to turn to dust.\nIn the site’s How it Works section, NAPSA says your beneficiary should notify NAPSA within 18 hours of your death. The association will ship overnight a preservation kit with the equipment to excise your tattoo and the packaging to ship NAPSA your skin. Your skin must be removed within 60 hours of death - a step your kin may want to leave to a mortician.\nFollow the instructions, the site says, and “In the following three to six months, your designated beneficiary will receive your beautifully preserved art!”\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
