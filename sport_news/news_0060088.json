(AP) â€” Miami Dolphins defensive end Olivier Vernon says he has been fined by the NFL for a late, low hit on Titan's quarterback Marcus Mariota and plans to appeal.\nVernon declined to say Wednesday how much he was fined. He hit the Tennessee rookie's knee Sunday and was criticized afterward by Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt, who said it appeared Vernon was trying to hurt Mariota.\nMariota sprained the MCL in his left knee but didn't miss a snap. He finished the game with a brace on his knee.\nVernon apologized after the game to Mariota, who said he didn't think the hit was malicious. On the play, Vernon drew the first of two penalties he received for roughing the passer.\nMiami won 38-10 under new interim coach Dan Campbell.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nUSA Today Sports' Lorenzo Reyes breaks down the NFL Power Rankings, including who's rising and which team is falling entering Week 7.", "external_links": ["http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4568441834001_colin-120.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4568439708001_Colin-480.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4568439708001_Colin-480.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4568439708001_Colin-480.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RU9tmf", "http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/nfl/2015/10/20/74269662/"], "published": "2015-10-21T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:34:13.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
