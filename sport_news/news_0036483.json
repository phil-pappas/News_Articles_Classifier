Pearson has been working in the Red Sox organization for nearly fifteen years, the last few had been spent as assistant trainer. Last month, the organization dropped the word assistant from Pearson's title.\n\"At some point I'll probably wit back and reflect on it,\" Pearson said. \"But for now it's just another step, another part of the job that I'm doing.\"\n\"Being the head trainer for the Boston Red Sox is just a great accomplishment,\" Red Sox pitcher, Rich Hill said. \"We have a really good relationship and I couldn't be happier for him. Just an unbelievable guy that's put in hard work and worked his way up through the system.\"\nA system that has seen ownership changes and upper management shifts. Not only does Pearson persevere through the changes, he always seems to get promoted because of it.\n\"If you are true to yourself. If you just put your head down and keep working hard and try not to think about all that external things and try to do a good job everyday. That's all you can do,\" Pearson said.\n\"He's as genuine and sincere as an athletic trainer that I've come across,\" Red Sox pitcher, Craig Breslow said. \"One who wants the best for his players, wants them to feel healthy and strong everyday.\"\nA guy who's good at his job, has respect from the players and loves what he does. Red Sox head trainer Brad Pearson has earned the right, to touch 'em all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:25:10.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
