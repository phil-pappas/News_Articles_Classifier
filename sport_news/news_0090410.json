Because, let's be honest: Who hasn't dreamt of seeing sumo wrestlers race? This event is everything you thought it would be and more. Not only did the race actually happen, but it wound up having a photo finish. There needs to be a petition started to make this an Olympic sport. It's just fascinating to watch.
