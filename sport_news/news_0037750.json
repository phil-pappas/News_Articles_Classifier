A day I’m looking forward to.”\nAnd given all that’s happened in the past two months, Flood probably should feel fortunate to still have his job. \nHis misstep was just one in a series of setbacks the Rutgers’ football program has faced this season. Last month, six players were dismissed from the team for their alleged roles in a series of home invasions and on-campus assaults; star receiver Leonte Carroo was suspended indefinitely after a domestic violence incident — the charges were dropped last week, and Carroo was reinstated after a 25-day suspension.\nMeanwhile Rutgers’ on-field product has been underwhelming. The Scarlet Knights lost their first two Big Ten Conference games this season, including an embarrassing 28-3 setback at Penn State in the conference opener. Now, Rutgers (2-3) faces powerhouses such as top-ranked Ohio State (at home on Oct. 24) and No. 12 Michigan (away on Nov. 7) in the coming weeks. If things turn badly, it might be too much for the embattled coach to overcome.\nBut Flood said he doesn’t feel as if he’s on “thin ice.”\n“I’ve never felt that way,” Flood said. “I feel like I have an excellent relationship with Dr. Barchi. I’ll leave his comments to him, but I feel fully supported.”\nLast month, after an investigation into Flood’s violation of school policy when he initiated contact with a professor over a player’s grade, Barchi admitted that all disciplinary options were considered, including termination.\nBut the school elected to keep Flood, offering its public support to him.\nMonday was the first chance for Flood to answer repeated questions about the broken rule for which he was suspended. And he took responsibility for what happened.\n“Ultimately, what’s important is that I’m responsible to know the rule,” Flood said. “As the head football coach, I’m responsible to know every rule.”\nThe most pressing question was about a contradiction: Flood said he didn’t know the rule about impermissible contact with a faculty member, but he seemed to try to hide his actions while contacting the professor — including using a private e-mail and not wearing any Rutgers gear while meeting with the professor.\n“I understand why, when looked at out of context, people might feel that way,” Flood said. “But the issue of the private e-mail was really just to protect the student athlete — the student athlete whose academic record had already been, to some degree, on public display when it shouldn’t have been.\n“The meeting with the professor was in an open courtyard in broad daylight,” Flood said. “The comment about not having Rutgers gear on was a very small-talkish type comment. But it’s one of the things I’ve learned in this process, is things like that, when you’re the head football coach, they can be taken out of context.”\nWhen asked how a head football coach didn’t know the rule, Flood said it was something he’s “not going to go into” and referred back to the report the school issued about the incident. But he also admitted “ultimately I am responsible.” Flood added that “nothing of this context” had happened before “and certainly nothing in the future.”\nFlood also said he doesn’t believe this incident will affect his ability to lead his team.\n“It’s something that I addressed with the players,” Flood said. “I made a mistake. There are consequences to those actions. Those have now been fulfilled, and now we move forward.”\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:12:45.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
