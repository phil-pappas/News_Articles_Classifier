The Islanders defeated the Devils 3-1. (Photo by Mike Stobe/NHLI via Getty Images) Fans interested in receiving a closer look at pre-game warmups for the New York Islanders' home contests better have the proper ticket in tow.\nAdChoices The Islanders have altered an unwritten rule allowing fans to watch the festivities from as close to the ice as possible, regardless of the ticket in their hand.\nThis season, Barclays Center CEO Brett Yormark announced a plan for 91 ticket holders per night to have access to VIP areas and watch the warmups. The decision, according to Yormark, is \"another great benefit of being an Islanders season ticket holder.\"\nMessage from @brettyormark to season ticket holders re: watching warm ups at the glass before face off. #Isles pic.twitter.com/hf6JhLsmYw\n— IslesBlog (@IslesBlog) October 14, 2015\nWhile presumably the No. 91 is in tribute to captain John Tavares, many fans have voiced their displeasure with the most recent turn of events since the team moved from the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y.\nThis whole #Isles season is going to be test of which battles to fight. Letting fans on the glass for warm-ups seems like should be one.\n— Dan Saraceni (@cultureoflosing) October 15, 2015\nThe team initially altered the Subway-style goal horn in the preseason , prompting numerous fans to vent on social media. The original Fog horn blast was returned later in the week.\n(h/t Islanders Point Blank )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Isles?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/brettyormark", "https://twitter.com/cultureoflosing/status/654446999148871680", "http://islanderspointblank.com/islanders/isles-fans-unhappy-with-barclays-center-warm-up-policy/", "http://www.foxsports.com/nhl/story/new-york-islanders-coliseum-goal-horn-subway-barclays-center-100215", "https://twitter.com/IslesBlog/status/654424846181531648", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://t.co/hf6JhLsmYw"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:57:47.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
