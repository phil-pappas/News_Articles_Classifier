Share This Article In a play on words derived from the cheering section at nearby University of Utah, several members of East wore shirts characterizing themselves as the \"Mess on the Hill.\" And it was kind of a mess on Friday night when East played host to Box Elder. From pregame banter to a second half filled with personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, the players' attention was often diverted from X's and O's. In the end, however, the host Leopards got what they wanted: A 36-15 win to stay unbeaten in region with a game against rival Highland looming next week. \"A lot of penalties tonight. Some were good and some were bad; we're just going to have to go back and look on tape,\" East coach Brandon Matich said. \"There was a little bit of taunting going on pregame. Some bad things being exchanged which shouldn't happen at a high school game.\" VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs East (5-2, 3-0 Region 5) scored the first quarter's lone touchdown on a short run by quarterback Johnnie Lang. But visiting Box Elder (2-6, 0-3), in search of its first league win, surprised the Leopards when quarterback Jarom Mecham found receiver Kyler Anderson on a 30-yard pass that set up Mecham's 1-yard quarterback sneak with 7:57 left in the second quarter. Mecham's conversion pass to Zach Gunn gave the Bees an 8-7 lead. \"We played well early and were competing, doing what we do,\" Box Elder coach Robbie Gunter said. \"I think we kind of got away from that. We're a good team, we've got a good eleven, and we started doing things that were uncharacteristic of us.\" It was Lang that answered in a hurry and made the visitors' lead very short-lived. The East quarterback got loose for a 51-yard run with 6:52 remaining before half. Coming out of intermission, Lang — now lined up in the slot — took a pitch on the Leopards' first offensive play from scrimmage in the second half. This time, he raced 49 yards to paydirt. After Lang's third TD of the night, a two-point conversion run by Jaylen Warren gave East a 22-8 margin. \"Our kids were pretty excited for this game. I think that got their juices flowing a little bit and then they went ahead and went for two to get the lead. It got our kids fired up,\" Matich said. If the Bees still entertained ideas of a comeback, most of those were squashed only 30 seconds later. That's when Kuen Roberts picked off a Box Elder pass and roared 60 yards for another touchdown. East closed their scoring with a 36-yard run by Sione Molisi midway through the third quarter. Box Elder scored its final TD on a 49-yard pass from Mecham to Taylor Ashcroft with three minutes remaining. \"Our defense did very good. We've got some big, fast and talented kids over there,\" Matich said. \"Those big kids were flying around over there. I love this team. It's a fun team to coach, they love each other, and it's a fun team to be around all the time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:14:01.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
