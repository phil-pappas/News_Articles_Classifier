They're always on it.\n\"It's extremely tough to throw a fastball by that guy, especially late in the count whenever you've shown him a couple. He might take some funny swings on some breaking balls, but that lets you know where he's at in his head.\n\"There's a saying in baseball, you can't sneak cheese past a rat. He does a really good job with that. That's what all the best hitters in baseball do, they sit on a fastball and they react to a breaking ball. He does a really good job with that.\nPrince then paused.\n\"I'm not calling Bautista a rat, OK,\" he said, drawing laughs.\nBautista is 16-for-49 in his career against Price with five home runs and 11 RBI.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:37:30.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
