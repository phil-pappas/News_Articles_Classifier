Dickey with two out, a runner on first and his team leading 7-1.\nI get it that he didn’t want Chin-Soo Choo to yank one into the seats to make it a 7-3 game and give the Rangers a sniff of hope.\nBut show a little faith. Dickey was throwing well and despite the fact that Choo hits him well, give him the opportunity of getting out of the inning and in line for the win. If Choo gets on base, then go to the bullpen.\nDickey has poured 19 years and his heart and soul into the game and he deserved the shot and the respect of giving him the chance to complete five innings.\nAs for the right decision, it was bringing Price into the game and passing the baton in Game 5 to Marcus Stroman.\nPrice has been terrific, more than terrific really, in his brief tenure with the Jays. In 11 regular-season starts he responded by going 9-1. The ace was aces.\nBut while Price looks like Cy Young against most teams, he resembles Josh Towers when he runs up against the Texas Rangers.\nIn four career post-season starts against the Rangers Price is 0-4.\nIn the two games he has faced them this series, the start in Game 1 and the relief work in Game 4, Price has tossed 10 inning and allowed eight runs on 11 hits including two home runs. His ERA in the series is 7.20.\nIn his career against the Rangers, Price is 3-4 with a 5.15 ERA.\nFor whatever the reason he just doesn’t seem to match up well against them.\nGibbons saw that in Game 1 and if he needed vindication for not starting Price in Game 5 it was how he looked in relief in Game 4 — three innings pitched, six hits, three earned runs.\nHanding Price the ball in a win-or-done game Wednesday afternoon would have been pure folly.\nBetter to go with Stroman who has been extremely sharp and likely fare better than his no-decision in Game 2.\nDon’t let Price near the mound Wednesday.\nROAD WARRIORS\nThe Jays were united in the belief that the pressure of running down the New YorkYankees and playing in front of a packed house of emotionally charged fans would ready them for the first post-season the franchise has seen since 1993.\nIt didn’t go that way as the Jays seemed to be unnerved by the hype and the frenzy at Rogers Centre and responding by looking unsettled and jittery in the opening two games. They definitely played more relaxed at Globe Life Park in Arlington. In the two games in Texas they settled down, looked relaxed and resembled the team that has wowed the city and all of Canada.\nIn Game 5, with the jitters out of the way, they should ride the energy inside Rogers Centre, not shrink from it.\nFIELDER’S FOLLY\nOne of the chief reasons the Rangers didn’t bounce the Jays in Texas was the ability of the Jays hurlers to neutralize the meat of the Texas lineup, especially cleanup hitter Prince Fielder and No. 5 hitter Mitch Moreland.\nIn the four games, Fielder has gone 2-for-16 - both hits being singles. Moreland, meanwhile, is 0-for-10.\nGerry Fraley of the Dallas Morning News had a good article Tuesday on the continuing woes of Fielder as far as his inability to drive in a run in post-season play. The Price has now gone 84 at-bats without driving in a run in the post-season, the last time being Oct. 13 of 2012 while with Detroit in the ALCS.\nOnly one player in MLB history has a longer unproductive streak and that dubious honour goes to Bill Mueller of the Giants and Red Sox who set the mark for futility between 1997 and 2004.\n“I’ll take a broken-bat grounder,” Fielder told Fraley. “Just get the man across the plate.”\nSo far it ain’t happening. Whatever the Jays are doing against Fielder, it’s working.\nBASES CLEAN\nOn a similar note, the Jays have more or less kept the Rangers in check by not letting their leadoff hitter get on base. The Rangers don’t hit a ton of home runs as they score most by stringing hits together and moving their runners along.\nIn the 41 innings Texas has played this series, the Rangers have managed to get their leadoff hitter on base just seven times.\nIn the past two games the Jays also haven’t allowed the Rangers a free pass as in no walks.\nYou gotta love that.\nRANGERS' HAMELS NOT GREEN\nCole Hamels has been there, done that.\nIf the reeling Texas Rangers are looking for someone who can get them over the hump in the decisive game of the Division Series on Wednesday they need look no further than Hamels.\nUnlike young Marcus Stroman, who gets the start for the Jays, Hamels has come through in the clutch in past big-time, big-moment post-season games.\nJays fans may not want to hear this, but in his days with the Philadelphia Phillies, Hamels has taken the ball on four different occasions when his team has had a chance to close out a series. His record in those four starts is 2-0 and it should be noted the Phillies won all four games.\nIn those four starts he has given up one, two, three and zero runs, respectively. The last time he was in this situation he responded with a complete game shutout in the 2010 NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds.\n“He will not give in to anything,” Rangers’ catcher Chris Gimenez said. “He’ll give us a chance to win.”\nGimenez, who is behind the plate for Hamels starts, said his presence Wednesday will give the rest of the team a boost of confidence.\n“I think first and foremost, the fact that he’s been there and done that multiple times, we have a World Series MVP on the mound for us next game, and just knowing the fact that he’s been there and was brought in here for those types of situations, I think it really gives us all the confidence in the world,” Giminez said Tuesday at the Rangers media conference back in Arlington. “And who else would you rather have on the mound when you have to win a game than your ace?”\nAfter being acquired from the Phillies at the trade deadline, Hamels has delivered the goods. In the regular season he was 7-1 with a 3.66 ERA in 12 start with Texas while in Game 2 against the Jays he received a no-decision allowing four runs on six hits over seven innings.\nThere is no other starter the Rangers would rather have for this moment than the veteran left-hander.\n“I think all great competitors, they have that innate desire, that burning desire to want to be on this type of stage, so that they physically prepare, they mentally prepare.” Texas manager Jeff Banister said Tuesday. But they also pay attention to the adversities and the challenges that they have faced along the way, because without understanding your own path and what it feels like to have failures and allow yourself to feel the sting of failures, you’re not building that ultimate desire bank to really want to succeed and then you’ve got to have the experience of having gone through these type of situations.”\nThey are counting on Hamels experience, they are counting on Hamels to come through.\nMLB PLAYOFFS\nStroman the right call for Blue Jays in Game 5\nBy Mike Rutsey , Toronto Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 04:52 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 05:07 PM EDT\nIn Game 4 John Gibbons made the wrong decision and he made the right decision.\nDealing with the former first, Captain Hook made the wrong decision to lift R.A.
