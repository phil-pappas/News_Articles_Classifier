Mighty decided to grab a cold beer for the LIRR ride home last Tuesday, so he stopped in a deli in Penn Station.\n“Let‘s try a 16 oz. Brooklyn Lager and pick me a nice cold one,” Mighty told the deli clerk.\n“That’ll be $5,” said the clerk.\n“Five dollars?” Mighty replied. “The sign clearly reads, ‘16 oz. can domestic beer: $3.’”\n“This is imported beer,” answered the deli clerk.\n“Imported? It’s brewed in Brooklyn (and sometimes Utica, N.Y.). I was born in Brooklyn. Brooklyn is on the other side of the East River. Plus, your sign reads, ‘Imported can beer: $4. Not $5 like you asked.’”\nThe deli clerk continued to look over the the Brooklyn Lager can. “Sorry, but we sell this as an import beer. You want it?”\n“No thanks, pally, I’ll shop somewhere else.”\nMighty hit with the Jaguars on Sunday and likes the Ravens on Monday. The deficit is 961 sirignanos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:13:43.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
