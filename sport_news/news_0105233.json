Security Council to \"stop making excuses for the Palestinians\" and hold them accountable for the current wave of violence.\n@Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Danny Danon told a U.N. Security Council ministerial meeting Thursday that the U.N. should end its usual practice of urging both sides to exercise restraint and demand that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas \"cease his incitement.\"\nDanon reiterated that Israel has not changed the \"status quo\" at Jerusalem's holiest site as Palestinians claim.\nEarlier, Palestinian foreign minister Riad Malki accused Israel of \"feeding the fires of religious racism and hatred\" and said its actions at the site will lead to religious strife.\nMalki demanded that Israel explain its claim that the \"status quo\" at the site is unchanged.\n___\n7:00 p.m.\nThe U.N. deputy secretary-general says the escalating Israeli-Palestinian crisis is a result of Israel's \"stifling and humiliating occupation\" of Palestinian territories for almost half a century and diminishing hopes for a viable Palestinian state.\nJan Eliasson told a U.N. Security Council ministerial meeting on Thursday that the failure to achieve a two-state solution and the reluctance of Israeli and Palestinian leaders to take \"the bold steps\" to make progress toward peace have created \"a highly combustible reality.\"\nHe said the international community must understand Israeli fears about personal safety and concerns about what they believe are growing attempts at \"delegitimization\" of the country.\nBut Eliasson blamed the deteriorating situation mainly on Israel's occupation, illegal settlements and the lack of Palestinian jobs and greater control over their security and government.\n___\n3:30 p.m.\nIsrael's sports minister is calling on FIFA to condemn recent remarks by her Palestinian counterpart that she says amount to incitement.\nIn a letter to the world soccer body released Thursday, Israel's Miri Regev says Palestinian soccer chief Jibril Rajoub has been \"spearheading\" a campaign of \"libel and incitement.\"\nShe noted that in a recent TV interview, Rajoub had hailed Palestinian attackers as courageous heroes. She urged FIFA to issue a \"clear and unequivocal condemnation\" and summon him to clarify the remarks.\nRajoub, who has repeatedly asked FIFA to sanction Israel, could not immediately be reached for comment.\nOver the past month, Israel has been dealing with a wave of Palestinian attacks, mostly stabbings.

The Palestinians say the violence is rooted in decades of occupation and tensions around a sensitive Jerusalem religious site.\nNetanyahu sparked an uproar this week by suggesting that a World War II-era Palestinian leader persuaded the Nazis to adopt their Final Solution to exterminate 6 million Jews. Holocaust experts and survivors slammed Netanyahu's comments as historically inaccurate\n___\n1:15 p.m.\nIsrael's internal security agency says that two Palestinian attackers who stabbed an Israeli earlier Thursday have records of militant activity.\nThe Shin Bet says the attackers were both born in 1995 and are residents of Surif, near the West Bank city of Hebron. It says that one attacker is a member of the Islamic militant Hamas group. The second attacker was jailed for two years after he was caught carrying a knife at a sensitive West Bank holy site.\nPolice say they stabbed an Israeli and moderately wounded him before they were shot by police. One attacker died of his wounds and the other was seriously wounded.\nMost of the Palestinian attackers in the wave of violence that has gripped the region have had no known links to militant groups.\n___\n12:20 p.m.\nIsraeli soldiers have placed a concrete barrier near a Jewish holy site in the West Bank, ahead of a religious pilgrimage there this weekend.\nA crane lowered the concrete blocks onto a street in the West Bank city of Bethlehem outside Rachel's Tomb on Thursday.

Police say hundreds of police will be deployed around the area for the event.\nBethlehem has been the scene of violent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops.\n___\n10:30 a.m.\nIsraeli police say a Palestinian attacker has died from his wounds after he stabbed an Israeli man and was then shot by police.\nPolice spokeswoman Luba Samri says the Palestinian died at a hospital shortly after Thursday's incident.\nPolice say two Palestinians stabbed an Israeli man in the city of Beit Shemesh after attempting to board a bus ferrying children to school.

The others were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces. Ten Israelis have been killed in attacks.\n___\n10:15 a.m.\nIsraeli police say four men will appear in court in connection with the beating of an Eritrean man during an attack by an Arab citizen at a bus station that killed an Israeli soldier and wounded several people.\nA private security guard shot the Eritrean, thinking he was an attacker. As the Eritrean lay on the ground, a mob of people cursed him, kicked him and hit him with objects. The Eritrean later died.\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld says the four men -- two civilians and two prison guards -- would appear in court Thursday in the southern city of Beersheba, where the attack occurred.\nRosenfeld says it is not clear if the men will be charged.\nHe says the autopsy report showed that the Eritrean died from the gunshot wound and not from the beating.\n___\n9:10 a.m.\nIsraeli police say soldiers shot and killed a Jewish man who attacked them, believing he was a \"terrorist.\"\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said Thursday that soldiers asked the man for his ID. He refused and then attempted to snatch a soldier's weapon.\nIn the incident late Wednesday in Jerusalem, the soldiers opened fire, killing the man. Rosenfeld said that based on the man's ID, he is Jewish.\nThe incident reflects the jittery mood that has gripped Israelis amid a monthlong wave of Palestinian stabbing attacks. Security has been beefed up around the country and many Israelis are on edge.\nEarlier this week, a private security guard shot an Eritrean migrant thinking he was an attacker.\n___\n8:25 a.m.\nIsraeli police say two Arab attackers have been shot after they stabbed an Israeli man.\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld says the attackers were seriously wounded in the attack in the city of Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. The Israeli was lightly wounded. It was not immediately clear who shot the attackers.\nThursday's incident was the latest in a monthlong wave of violence that has gripped the region. Ten Israelis have been killed in stabbing attacks, while 47 Palestinians or Arab citizens of Israel have been killed, including 26 identified by Israel as attackers.\nDiplomatic efforts are underway to try to bring an end to the violence.
