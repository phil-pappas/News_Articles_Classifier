(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT \nTORONTO (AP) — Texas Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus will spend a long time wondering what went wrong with his usually sure-handed defense. \nAndrus made two of three Texas errors in the bottom of the 7th inning that helped give back the lead to Toronto after the Rangers went ahead on one crazy blunder in the top half, and the Blue Jays earned their first trip to the American League Championship Series since 1993 with a 6-3 victory in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series. \n“This is the toughest moment of my career so far,” Andrus said afterward in the Rangers clubhouse. “I feel like I let down my team and my city. It’s going to be a long offseason.” \nThe Rangers became just the third team to lose a best-of-five series after winning the first two games on the road. The A’s blew a lead in 2001 against the Yankees, while Cincinnati wasted a 2-0 lead against the 2012 Giants. Both of the winners went on to reach the World Series. \n“It’s the most emotionally charged game that I’ve ever played,” Bautista said. \nToronto will play the Royals in the ALCS. Game 1 is Friday night at Kansas City. \nDespite the tough finish in Toronto, first-year Rangers manager Jeff Banister said he was proud of his team for winning an AL West title that few thought was possible after ace Yu Darvish was lost for the season with an elbow injury. And after the team started the season 8-16, 9 1-2 games back in the division. \n“One inning won’t define who this ball club is and who they’ve been all season long,” Banister said. \nBautista’s homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin’s throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score. \nThat was crazy,” Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman said. “With all that happened, we did a good job of keeping our emotions in check.” \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay. \nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors, and Toronto rallied. Benches cleared twice in the Blue Jays’ half of the inning. \nRoberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save. \nOsuna turned toward the outfield after striking out Wil Venable, looked to the sky and was mobbed by his teammates as jubilant fans rocked the Rogers Centre. \nAfter Edwin Encarnacion tied it 2-all with a second-deck drive off tough-luck loser Cole Hamels in the sixth, Odor led off the seventh with a single and went to third on a sacrifice and groundout. \nWith Choo up, Martin’s throw back to reliever Aaron Sanchez deflected off Choo’s left hand and dribbled toward third base. \nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned the call, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home. \n“I just caught the ball and threw it back very casually and it hit his bat and then next thing you know run scores,” Martin said. “It’s never happened in my life before. It’s just one of those moments, and it created an opportunity for us to do something special.” \nScott acknowledged making a mistake with his initial ruling. \n“I was mixing up two rules,” Scott said. “If there’s no intent, if he’s not out of the box, that throw is live.” \nFans littered the field with objects during the delay as umpires sorted out a play that is certain to rank up there with Derek Jeter’s Jeffrey Maier homer or Reggie Jackson’s hip block of a throw as one of the craziest in the postseason. \n“We went in the tunnel back there (behind the dugout) to get out of the way,” Rangers pitcher Sam Dyson said of the barrage of bottles and other items. \nAccording to rule Major League Baseball rule 6.03(a)(3), the batter is not to be charged with interfering with the catcher if the batter is still in the batter’s box and doesn’t make a movement to block or disrupt the throw. \nThis type of play is not subject to manager’s review but Scott, the crew chief, after discussing the ruling with Blue Jays manager John Gibbons, called an umpire’s review. After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field. \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest. \nNo need for the paperwork, though. \nThe Rangers made three consecutive errors to start the bottom half, with Martin reaching on a fielding error by Andrus to start it off. \nKevin Pillar followed with a grounder to first but Martin was safe at second on an errant throw by Mitch Moreland. \nAfter Dalton Pompey pinch ran for Martin, Ryan Goins followed with a sacrifice bunt. Adrian Beltre fielded the ball and threw to third, but Andrus dropped the ball for his second error of the inning, loading the bases for Ben Revere. \nRevere grounded into a fielder’s choice, with Moreland throwing Pompey out at the plate. \nAfter Sam Dyson relieved Hamels, Donaldson tied it at 3 with a flare just beyond the reach of Odor at second, but Revere was forced out. \nBautista followed with a towering drive into the second deck, glaring at Dyson as he stood at home plate to admire his go-ahead drive, enthusiastically flipping his bat away. \nWith some fans continuing to litter the field, Edwin Encarnacion turned to face the crowd and appealed for calm, lifting his bat and helmet over his head. Dyson took exception and walked over to confront Encarnacion, leading to both dugouts and both bullpens emptying. \n“I told him Jose needs to calm that down, respect the game a little more,” Dyson said. \nHamels was also disappointed by Bautista’s celebration. \n“It’s tough to see,” Hamels said. “a lot of us on our team don’t carry ourselves that way.” \nDuring the scrum that was quickly dissolved, 20 Toronto police officers stood across the outfield, while others stood along the foul lines. Police later stood on the roof of the Rangers’ first base dugout before the bottom of the ninth. \nEncarnacion and Chris Colabello both singled when play resumed, but the bat-around inning ended when Troy Tulowitzki fouled out. Dyson made contact with Tulowitzki as he walked off, leading to another benches-clearing confrontation, with catcher Chris Gimenez shoving Tulowitski before the scrum was broken up. \nTexas opened the scoring in the first when Delino DeShields scored on a fielder’s choice by Prince Fielder. Choo homered off Marcus Stroman in the third to make it 2-0. \nChoo’s homer was the first for the Rangers since Odor connected off David Price in the seventh inning of Game 1.
