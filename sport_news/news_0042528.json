Right-hander Marco Estrada gets the start for the Blue Jays while Edinson Volquez with pitch for the Royals. Here are five players to watch on each team as the two clubs play for a spot in the World Series: \nTORONTO Marco Estrada: The Game 1 starter had the best performance of any member of the Toronto rotation in the first round: He allowed just one run and five hits in 6-1/3 innings in must-win Game 3. He allowed three hits and two runs in 5-2/3 innings in a win over the Royals on July 30. He will likely make two starts in the series. \nDavid Price: After two rough appearances against Texas — one start and one in relief — Price’s post-season earned run average is up to 5.04 in 12 career games. That is still a small sample size, but the conversation grows louder with each performance below his standard. A shutdown effort would be monumental. \nJose Bautista: With his Game 5 exploits in the ALDS, gone are the questions about how he will adapt to the playoffs. Now, a series against a team he performed well against: Bautista hit .321 with two home runs in seven games versus Kansas City this year. He has a .383 on-base percentage in 30 career games at Kauffman Stadium. \nRyan Goins: The Blue Jays’ second baseman made three stellar plays in Game 5 against Texas, integral in the win. He also did not record a single hit in 17 at-bats in the five-game series, managing just one walk. Goins is in the Toronto lineup for his glove, but the occasional appearance on base would be helpful. \nAaron Loup: With Brett Cecil’s calf injury sidelining him and Price presumably being saved for starts, at least early in the series, Loup is going to be essential in facing left-handed hitters Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas and Alex Gordon. Loup missed the last two games of the ALDS because of an undisclosed personal issue, and has had an off year in general. \nKANSAS CITY Edinson Volquez: He will start Game 1, and gave up three earned runs in 11-1/3 innings over two starts against the Blue Jays this year. You probably best remember him from the game on Aug. 2, when he hit Josh Donaldson once, threw inside on him another time and called him “a little baby” afterward. This should be fun. \nBen Zobrist: As a former Tampa Bay Ray, Zobrist has faced the Blue Jays a lot. In 60 career games at the Rogers Centre, Zobrist has a .388 on-base percentage with 12 home runs. He had a big ALDS, too, with a team-leading .333 batting average.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:53:22.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
