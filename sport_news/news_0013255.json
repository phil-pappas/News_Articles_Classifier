(Tim Schwartz/Howard County Times video) Tim Schwartz Contact Reporter Atholton scored 28 points in the first quarter to beat Centennial 42-13 and get over .500 mark \nThunder, lightning and a little jitterbug – that’s how Atholton coach Bruce Cummings describes his three top running backs. \nSometimes they each get a share of the pie, but against visiting Centennial on Friday, it was thunder’s turn to take over the game. \n“Eric Love is our lightning, Jelani Dula is our thunder, and Colin Douglas is our jitterbug,” Cummings said. “We like that combination because it’s a good switch up to the defense. The defense seeing a fast guy, then you put in a big guy like Jelani, who wants to pound it. Then you put in our jitterbug and he’s making jukes and all that stuff. On offense we want to keep the defense off balance, so it’s good we have those three tiers of running backs to switch the game up. Tonight, we went with thunder.” \nIn the first half alone, Dula finished with seven carries for 125 yards and a touchdown, while the Raiders scored on their first five possessions in a 42-13 domination of the Eagles. \nQuarterback Dominic Totaro threw for 88 yards on four first-half completions, three of which were touchdown passes. His first one to Kane Jackson for 32 yards less than three minutes into the game was followed by an Atholton fumble recovery on the kickoff. Cole Mason scored a 13-yard touchdown run on the very next play, putting the Raiders up 14-0 just 2:51 into the contest. \nAtholton plays Centennial football at Atholton High School Friday, October 16, 2015 (Steve Ruark/For The Baltimore Sun Media Group photos) \n“Once we got that first touchdown, I felt our kids’ confidence boost, and they smelt blood in the water,” Cummings said. “They just went out there and tried to score as much as possible. Our main goal was to make sure we execute this game and get out with a win.” \nDula opened Atholton’s third drive with a 41 yard run, and three plays later Totato found Alex Myers for a 25-yard touchdown pass to make it 21-0. \nAfter the Raiders forced Centennial to punt after a three and out, the man they call thunder finished another scoring drive with runs of 39-, 11- and 7-yards, the last of which was a touchdown, to give his team a 28-0 lead late in the first quarter. \nEvery Thursday of each week, Howard County Times football beat reporter Tim Schwartz ranks the Howard County teams based on their body of work this fall.

It was just execution.” \n“We started out fast and strong and just kept moving the ball,” said Totaro. “We didn’t take our foot off the gas pedal. ... When you throw one touchdown, you start to get hot. You start to get a lot of confidence in yourself.” \nAtholton (4-3) continued to pour it on early in the second quarter. This time the jitterbug Colin Douglas was in the back field, and he ran the ball four times in the drive for 40 yards while tight end Chris Green caught two passes for 18- and 13-yards, including a touchdown, to expand the lead to 35-0 and force a running clock with 7 minutes, 12 seconds until halftime. \n“It was some alignments and some adjustments we didn’t see early on, and we made some adjustments in the second half to make things better,” said Centennial coach Carlos Dunmoodie. \nCentennial (0-7) stopped the running clock on its first drive of the second half when quarterback Michael Klein found Mason Smith on a short pass. Smith took care of the rest, as he ran 59 yards to the house to cut the Raiders lead to 35-7. \nAfter Atholton missed a 23-yard field goal attempt, the Eagles’ put together another nice drive. Klein found Eli Ross for a 17-yard completion to the Raiders’ 42, and two plays later Miguel Almeida ran for an 11-yard gain to close out the third quarter. \nOn a fourth down and 10 from the Atholton 28, Klein threw a pass to the right to Smith behind the line of scrimmage, who then threw the double pass to a wide-open Almeida in the end zone to make it 35-13 after a blocked extra point attempt. \nCentennial continued its second half momentum by intercepting a pass by third string quarterback Collin McMahon at its own 9, and Smith caught a 62-yard completion on the next play. Unfortunately for the Eagles, though, the drive ended when Tristen Patla intercepted Klein’s pass and returned it 85 yards for a touchdown, making it 42-13. \n“I thought we were close tonight, but the game got away from us pretty quickly in the first few minutes of the game,” Dunmoodie said about how close he feels his team is to getting their first win since 2013. “We have two more tough games against Reservoir and Wilde Lake, so we will go back and look at the film and take it week by week.” \nFor Atholton, the win marks the first time it has been over the .500 mark since 2012. The Raiders will travel to face River Hill on Oct. 23, and Cummings knows that is a game that could make or break their 3A East playoff hopes. \n“Before the game, we talked about how Centennial is just another team that was in our way,” Cummings said. “We talked about us being over .500 for the first time in over three years, and how important that is to the program. But ultimately, we’re trying to get into the playoffs. We needed to get this win, and we need to go into River Hill and execute and play physical so we can win that football game and hopefully at the end of the season we’ll be in the playoffs. It’s a huge game, and added to it is they’re our rivals. The kids already know it’s rivalry week, and we’ve got to go over to River Hill and just go out there and play hard.” \nAtholton (4-3) – 28 7 0 7 – 42 \nCentennial (0-7) – 0 0 7 6 – 13 \nFirst quarter \nA: Dominic Totaro 32-yard pass to Kane Jackson (Ben Lovera kick) [7-0] \nA: Cole Mason 13-yard run (Lovera kick) [14-0] \nA: Totaro 25-yard pass to Alex Myers (Lovera kick) [21-0] \nA: Jelani Dula 7-yard run (Lovera kick) [28-0] \nSecond quarter \nA: Totaro 13-yard pass to Chris Green (Lovera kick) [35-0] \nThird quarter \nC: Michael Klein 59-yard pass to Mason Smith (Nick Cooper kick) [35-7] \nFourth quarter \nC: Smith 28-yard pass to Miquel Almeida (kick blocked) [35-13] \nA: Tristen Patla 85-yard interception return (Lovera kick) [42-13] \nOther scores: \nHoward (7-0) – 6 21 13 7 – 47 \nHammond (2-5) – 0 2 0 8 – 10 \nFirst quarter \nHo: Casey Crawford 56-yard pass to Bryson Craven (kick blocked) [6-0] \nSecond quarter \nHo: Malik Anderson 70-yard run (Michael Gillespie kick) [13-2] \nHo: Anderon 3-yard run (Gillespie kick) [20-2] \nHo: Alex Thorton 0-yard fumble recovery (Gillespie kick) [27-2] \nThird quarter \nHo: Crawford 41-yard pass to Anderson (Gillespie kick) [34-2] \nHo: Peyton Jones 41-yard interception return (kick blocked) [40-2] \nFourth quarter \nHa: Nakari Lodge 2-yard run (two-point conversion) [40-10] \nHo: Robby Porter 31-yard pass to Cameron Carlyle (Gillespie kick) [47-10] \nHoward stat leaders: \nPassing – Casey Crawford (11/14, 197 yards, 2 TD) \nRushing – Malik Anderson (9 carries, 106 yards, 2 TD) \nReceiving – Bryson Craven (2 receptions, 72 yards, 1 TD) \nMarriotts Ridge (6-1) – 0 14 7 13 – 34 \nWilde Lake (3-4) – 0 0 7 0 – 7 \nSecond quarter \nMR: Tyler Poole 3-yard run (Zain Baig kick) [7-0] \nMR: Defense 0-yard fumble recovery (Baig kick) [14-0] \nThird quarter \nMR: Eli Turner 21-yard run (Baig kick) [21-0] \nWL: Connor Robinson 22-yard pass to Quez Bradley (Jason MacMillan kick) [21-7] \nFourth quarter \nMR: Troy Hensh 54-yard run (kick failed) [27-7] \nMR: Trayvon Delk 16-yard run (Baig kick) [34-7] \nGlenelg (4-3) 52, Long Reach (2-5) 12 \nOakland Mills (5-2) 48, River Hill (3-4) 27 \nGame on Oct. 17", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:14:33.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
