They know what's on the line. They know the kind of work it takes, and they know rah-rah stuff lasts 20 or 30 seconds and then there's 24 minutes (of racing) to go. They look into each other's eyes in early July, make an agreement and go to work.\"\nWetmore is at liberty to say that with both teams, who are now both older and wiser than they were a year ago. Both he and coach Heather Burroughs tell them in practice that they are among the best teams — and perhaps the best combined — they've ever seen at CU.\nSaturday's 30th annual Rocky Mountain Shootout — the team's lone home meet this season — showed the pieces are there, even if the day was mostly for knocking away cobwebs after a long summer of training. The men are ranked No. 1 in the country in the latest coaches poll, and the women are ranked second behind New Mexico.\nAdvertisement \"I saw two good teams — two teams maybe a little better than expected,\" Wetmore said. \"A year ago, the conditions were perfect and the stars were in alignment and people ran real fast, and I didn't expect to come closer to those performances this year ... But they did anyway. So despite my apprehensions or superstitions, people ran really fast, comparable to a year ago — the women a little better.\"\nBut there are still two months to go until the Nov. 21 championship in Louisville, Ky. And as Wetmore is fond of repeating, you have to qualify to get there first, and much can happen over the next two months. The men — coming off their second-straight NCAA title — are returning five All-Americans to the roster this year.\n\"The men are about the same five deep, and a little better at six, seven and eight, which are your back-up people if something goes wrong in the front five,\" he said. \"I think it's a little better team.\"\nOnly four schools since the men's championships were first contested in 1938 have ever won at least three straight titles. The last to do it was Arkansas, under coach John McDonnell, from 1998-2000. Prior to that, Arkansas won four straight from 1990-1993, joining UTEP from 1978-1981 as the only other team to four-peat. Villanova won three consecutive from 1966-1968, and Drake also did it from 1944-1946.\nThe depth at both teams means a different runner could be No. 1 from week-to-week, which is exactly what happened last year with the men. Regardless, members of both squads are quick downplay expectations this season.\n\"We talk about it sometimes, but it's not something that affects us negatively,\" said senior Pierce Murphy, who won the 8-kilometer race in 24 minutes, 26 seconds, the fifth fastest time on the course and a second behind his time from last year. \"If anything, it makes us train harder. ... It's nice we're not really hiding anything. Everyone knows we're good. They expect us to run fast, so we just have to train hard and stay focused.\"\nWetmore believes the women are well ahead of where they were last year, when the team finished seventh at NCAAs. The trick now is managing the next seven weeks carefully.\n\"I think everyone in their own head has some high standards for us, and we'll work hard to achieve whatever we can,\" said Erin Clark, who won the 5.8K women's race, leading CU to a sweep of the top six spots in team scoring. \"You have got to make it there first. I don't want to throw anything too big out there.\"\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, d petty@denverpost.com or @ danielpetty", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/danielpetty"], "published": "2015-10-03T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:55:43.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
