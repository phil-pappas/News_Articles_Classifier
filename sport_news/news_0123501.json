Prosise's 56-yard touchdown catch with 14 minutes, 13 seconds remaining left his team trailing by 12?\nHe was just going off the charts.\n\"If you look at it after the fact you can draw any conclusion you'd like,\" Kelly said. \"I didn't have any of the information you have right now after the fact. … I don't chase points until the fourth quarter, and our mathematical chart … it says on our chart to go for two.\"\nKelly further reasoned that the Irish had the wind at their backs in the fourth quarter, so with a two-point conversion, another touchdown and a field goal would have tied the score. And if the pass hadn't sailed through the hands of Corey Robinson, Kelly said, the Irish could have kicked the point after after their last touchdown and returned to South Bend 5-0.\n\"It was the smart decision to make,\" Kelly said.\nBut had Notre Dame kicked the extra point the first time around, it would not have been forced to go for two again after Torii Hunter Jr. 's touchdown catch with 7 seconds left, and the game — assuming both kicks were made — could have been decided in overtime.\nNotre Dame's Joe Schmidt on loss to Clemson Notre Dame's Joe Schmidt talks about the Irish's loss to Clemson.\nNotre Dame's Joe Schmidt talks about the Irish's loss to Clemson.\nSee more videos Instead, Notre Dame's hopes for a tie were abolished at the 3-yard line when quarterback DeShone Kizer was tackled on the last conversion attempt.\nThat play call, too, was questioned. Were the Irish leery to pass after failing on the first attempt?\nNot according to Kelly, who said Clemson's six-man box invited the opportunity.\n\"We had a favorable look, it was the look we were hoping to get,\" he said. \"We did a poor job of blocking their nickel.\"\nNo excuses: As David Robinson consoled his son Corey Robinson outside the Notre Dame locker room Saturday night, the wide receiver's teammates standing nearby were left to wonder what could have been after committing four turnovers, including losing three of their six fumbles.\nChris Brown fumbled at Clemson's 4-yard line trying to stretch for a score with 2:09 glowing on the clock in an eight-point game.\n\"Not being careful with the ball, and that's what happens,\" Brown said. \"I tried to do too much.\"\nNotre Dame's Sheldon Day Notre Dame's Sheldon Day discusses the loss to Clemson.\nNotre Dame's Sheldon Day discusses the loss to Clemson.\nSee more videos Injury update: Offensive lineman Quenton Nelson sprained his ankle Saturday and was in a boot Sunday, Kelly said.
