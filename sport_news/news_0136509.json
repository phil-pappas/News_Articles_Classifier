When senior tight end Johnathan Powell caught his first touchdown pass of the year with 1:40 left in the game and Barkley Legens sack of for a safety clinched an upset bid by Ouachita over the previously undefeated Harding Bison, 26-21. “I thought we played a much better second half after we got used to the option,” Ouachita Baptist University head football coach Todd Knight said. “I don’t care how long you practice or what you do, it takes some time. They are the number two rushing team for a reason, but I thought we did a great job in the second half.” Demetric Jennings forced a Harding fumble on third down from the Ouachita 3 with the Bison leading 21-17. Devin Price scooped up the fumble and returned it to the Ouachita 46. Ouachita quarterback Austin Warford led an 11 play, 54-yard drive that ended with Powell’s 7-yard touchdown catch. Cole Antley added the extra point with 1:52 left in the game, put the Tigers up 24-21. Harding’s Zach Shelley decided to return a deep Antley kickoff to the back of the end zone and only made it to the Bison 12 before Matthew Berry and Justin Jones brought him down. Harding quarterback Park Parish pass to Riley Hawkins was dropped, then Waymon Johnson rushed Parrish into another incomplete pass. A sideline interference penalty on the Bison moved the ball back to the seven yard line, and Parrish threw another incomplete pass. On fourth down, Legens was quick to the backfield and sacked Parish in the end zone for a safety with 1:17 left. Ouachita received the free kick and ran out the time to claimed the upset. “We left some touchdowns on the field that really hurt us,” Knight said. “It put us in a hole. We knew Harding was going to run the football, because throwing it every down you were going to lose time of possession and the defense is going to be on the field all day. I thought the game plan was great.” Ouachita opened the game with 48-yard kickoff return by Ke’Vontae Pope. After a 10-play 34 yard drive, the Tigers took a 3-0 lead on a 32-yard field goal from Cole Antley. Harding answered with a 13 play drive that ended with a one-yard touchdown run by Parish for a 7-3 lead with 4:09 to go in the first quarter. Brandon Marks ran for consecutive rushes of 5-yards, 9-yards and 16-yards to get the ball into Harding territory. After a timeout, Warford thew a 26-yard completion to Evian Hill to the Bison 19. Marks ran for seven yards to continue the threat for Ouachita (4-1), but Kris Oliver fumbled at the Harding 8 and the ball was recovered by Daylon Markham at the 1-yard line.

On the first play of the second quarter, Eric Kelly ran for a 51-yard gain to the Ouachita 13 and two plays later, Simmons carried in for a 10-yard touchdown and a 14-3 lead. Tristan Parsley field a Harding punt later in the second quarter, but the Bison were whistled for a kick catching interference penalty that moved the ball to the Harding 33. After a Warford 19-yard pass to Ke’Vonte Pope, Harding was penalized 15 yards for a personal foul penalty, which put the ball at the Bison 6. Marcks ran for four yards on first down and scored on a 2-yard run on the next play. Antley added the extra point to cut the Harding lead to 14-10 with 5:05 to play before halftime. The Ouachita defense came up with one of the most important momentum switching stops of the game when Harding (4-1) had moved down to the Tigers 5 with scoring in mind. On third and goal, Parish was sacked by Alex Myres and fumbled. Jaholon Mitchell recovered the loose ball at the Ouachita 8 with 1:17 to play before halftime. The Tigers defense forced Harding to turn the ball over on downs on the first series of the third quarter at the Ouachita 21. A face-mask penalty on Harding on a Warford 4-yard run put the ball in Bison territory. Warford ran for two more first downs during the drive and had a 22-yard run to the Harding 1. He kept on a quarterback sneak for a 1-yard touchdown to put the Tigers ahead. Antley’s extra point made it a 17-14 Ouachita lead with 3:22 left in the third quarter. Harding took the lead back early in the fourth quarter when Michael Latu broke free up the middle for a 28-yard touchdown run to make it 21-14. Ouachita marked back down field highlighted by a 46-yard completion from Warford to Brandon Marks to the Harding 20. The drive stalled and Antley attempted a 31-yard field goal that was blocked by T.J. Winslow. The Bison got a 31-yard run from Logan Best to the Ouachita 32, then two plays later, Parish was sacked by Jennings and Price returned it to set up the Tiger’s game-winning series. “It thought the guys did a good job,” Knight said. “Our rushing game was good and the passing was good and Austin made plays.” Warford completed 12-of-17 passes for 153 yard and a touchdown. He also ran 17 times for 91 yards and a touchdown, while Marks finished with 73 yards rushing and Oliver had 64. Ouachita will travel to Russellville next Saturday to take on Arkansas Tech.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:48:27.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
