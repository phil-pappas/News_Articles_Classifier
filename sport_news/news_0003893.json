Whether defenders were playing press coverage or several yards away, receivers still often ran routes that didn’t exploit a potential advantage.\nOn Thursday, Stafford, coach Jim Caldwell and star wide receiver Calvin Johnson mostly declined to detail what liberties the quarterback has before each snap. Asked if he can call out hot routes for receivers, though, Stafford provided a bit of insight.\n“It doesn’t really work like that, no,” he said.\nOn many snaps, the Lions call two plays and Stafford has the chance to check to the second option after surveying the defense. That’s what happened on the failed 2-point conversion run by Joique Bell in Week 3, a play that was originally a pass.\n“Certain plays I have more freedom than others,” Stafford said. “I would say it’s fairly similar to what it’s been in the past.”\nStafford had an increasing amount of control during his five seasons under offensive coordinator Scott Linehan. With longtime center Dominic Raiola gone, Stafford now has more control over the pre-snap blocking assignments and consistently communicates with current center Travis Swanson, but Stafford said one player missing isn’t leading to the offensive woes.\nCaldwell, meanwhile, didn’t want to discuss Stafford’s freedom for fear of giving “tips” to opponents.\n“I’m not going to tell you everything we do from a strategic standpoint,” he said. “That doesn’t make any sense.”\nJohnson took the same tact as Caldwell, saying such answers stay within the doors of the team facility.\nThrough three games, the Lions rank 27th in total offense, tied for 23rd in points scored, 32nd in rushing and tied for 30th with eight giveaways. Stafford said his optimism looking forward comes from seeing the hard-working and talented players in his group, but he acknowledged he has to make improvement, too.\n“Obviously, I can play better,” he said. “I can make better decisions (and) throw better passes to keep us out of bad situations.”\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:06:50.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
