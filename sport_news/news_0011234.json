Deepak Dhiman said, “This is a symbolic protest to remind the management that we are united in our movement. Labour plays a pivotal role in establishing the firm as well as earning profits. Our concerns are genuine. However, the company is indifferent towards our demands.” He said if their demands were not fulfilled at the earliest, they would be forced to hit the streets. Mahesh Chandra, Bhagwan Singh, Deepak Chand, Dhiraj, Deepak, Manoj, Adesh, Vipin, Radhe Shyam, Harish and Darshan were present. They also submitted a memorandum to the Assistant Labour Commissioner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:07:05.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
