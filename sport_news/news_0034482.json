We need to defend better,\" Mourinho said. \"When you don't have the ball, quality means nothing and what means [he thumps his chest] ... you have or you don't have. \n\"It was just a tactical decision, leaving super quality on the bench, but bringing tactical discipline and hoping that the team could be solid. \n\"Willian and Pedro did amazing defensive work and allowed the [central] midfield players to be very comfortable.\" \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
