GIRLS SOCCER: Win puts Archbishop Williams in tournament Behind a quick start with three goals in the first 20 minutes, Archbishop Williams rolled to a 3-1 victory over St. Mary's on Monday that qualified them for the Div. 4 South tournament. Comment The Patriot Ledger Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 12:24 am Updated at 7:43 AM CLICK ON THE ARROW ON THE PHOTO TO SEE MORE BRAINTREE – It was a quick start for the Archbishop Williams High girls soccer team that propelled them into the postseason Monday afternoon. The Bishops scored two goals in the first six minutes en route to a 3-1 victory over St. Mary’s (Lynn) at Memorial Field. The win qualified Williams (8-3, 6-3 Catholic Central League) for the Division 4 South Sectional tournament. “It was nice to score two off the bat,” coach Gordie McClay said. “And that’s what we wanted; we wanted at least one and we were fortunate enough to get two.” In the fourth minute, sophomore Chigozie Sumani (Randolph) opened the scoring with her team-leading ninth goal of the season. Just two minutes later, senior Rachel McManus (Braintree) found the back of the net to push the lead to 2-0. The Bishops’ offensive push continued later in the half as sophomore Asiah Dingle (Stoughton) connected off a corner kick from freshman Mackenzie Heath to bring the lead to 3-0. “Even at 3-0, you’re never comfortable playing them,” McClay said of St. Mary’s. “They’re always quick to come back.” However, the Bishops’ defense was able to keep St. Mary’s off the board in the first half as sophomore goalkeeper Kaylee Walsh (Weymouth) made one of her nine saves against a breakaway. “That’s what we need out of her,” McClay said. “She missed the first six game of the season with an injury, so she’s just getting back into it. It was great to see her do that, and that’s what we expect out of her.” With comfortable 3-0 lead at the break, the Bishops were able to tinker with their alignment and try out different formations in preparation for a difficult four-game stretch this week. “We were looking at some different formations,” McClay said of the second half. “We were trying different girls in different positions, defensively and offensively.” With a tournament berth now in hand, the Bishops look to their remaining five games to tune up for the postseason, beginning Wednesday with Bishop Fenwick at home. “We have two huge games against Bishop Fenwick (remaining),” McClay said. “We want to have a good showing. We really want to put it together.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:07:00.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
