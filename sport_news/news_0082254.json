Alexander Hassenstein / Bongarts/Getty Images Oct 9, 2015 at 11:52a ET 0Shares \nGermany will be without midfielder Mario Gotze for Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Georgia. \nGotze had to come off during the first half of Thursday's 1-0 loss to the Republic of Ireland in Dublin due to a groin problem. \nAnd Germany boss Joachim Low, quoted on www.dfb.de, said of the Bayern Munich man: \"Mario Gotze will definitely not be playing on Sunday.\" \nNo indication has been given at this stage of how bad the 23-year-old's injury might be. \nMeanwhile, Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger looks set to be unavailable as well for the weekend's Group D game in Leipzig. \nThe 31-year-old sat out the Ireland match, reportedly because of a thigh injury, and Low added after the contest: \"For Bastian Schweinsteiger we'll have to wait and see. The chances are slim though.\" 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:24:47.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
