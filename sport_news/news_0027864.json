After he won the Kentucky Derby, Funny Cide fever was all the rage in the Capital Region. So, the Times Union decided to send two writers to Baltimore. Matt Graves was the head horse-racing writer back then, and I went along for the ride.\nOne of my assignments was to chronicle the craziness that is the Pimlico infield. If you've never been, it's Mardi Gras , spring break and a raucous bachelor or bachelorette shindig all rolled up into one.\nRelated Stories Longtime broadcast newsman Ed O'Brien dies Anyway, my bosses wanted me to find local people who were part of the infield madness.\nAs I sat in the press box on that raw, rainy day, I wondered how in the heck I was going to do that. There were 109,000 people at Pimlico.\nThen I got my answer: Ed O'Brien was in the press box!\nO'Brien was covering Funny Cide for WRGB-6 back home. We were friends, so I asked him for a small favor. All he had to do was walk with me through the beer-goggled crowd. Someone was sure to recognize him, I figured. And that's exactly what happened. As we waded through the masses, men and women yelled out to their favorite Capital Region morning anchorman. I found more than enough people to talk to about Funny Cide. Thanks to Eddie.\nBelieve me, Eddie had no massive ego. A grin lit up his big Irish face when people came up to him to shake his hand. He didn't even mind — much — when one guy slurred, \"Hey, it's the weatherman!\"\nEnjoy this free sample of a TU+ story. Learn how to get full access and other subscriber benefits. Eddie died Tuesday. His services are Friday. One of the area's most familiar voices has been silenced forever at the all-too-young age of 59. Most people will remember Eddie from his days on the morning anchor desk at WRGB. I'll remember him for the laughs and the good times around the world of sports.\nHorse racing would top the list. I could tell stories about going out and betting Breeders' Cup races with him. Or how he looked forward every year to his trip to Aqueduct Race Track for \"Jamaica Day.\" He was a regular in the Saratoga Race Course press box, but often times, he would excuse himself, saying he had to go downstairs to be with \"his people.\" That could be anyone. Eddie liked just about everyone he ever met. And they all loved him back.\nSince his passing, you probably have heard about his quick wit, his hearty laugh and his affection for all things sports.\nWhen he worked at Channel 10 and premiered \"Ed O'Brien's Sports Final,\" a 15-minute Sunday night wrap-up show, he asked me to be his first live guest. Afterward, Eddie said there never would be a live guest again. I was that good. Sure I was. Looked like a frog sitting on a rock.\nThere were also the days of the Albany Patroons, one of Eddie's favorite local teams to cover.\nWhen the Continental Basketball Association was a big show in town, he would be there, either working or as a fan. One of the players Eddie befriended was one of the best that ever played here: Vince Askew . Before Askew played in the NBA with the Seattle SuperSonics , he and Eddie became pals.\nAskew took to calling Eddie \"Moon,\" because he thought Eddie had a big head. One night, when the Patroons were playing at what was then called \"Knickerbocker Arena,\" Eddie was the public-address announcer. While Eddie spoke into the microphone, Askew, stretching on the floor, heard the booming voice bouncing off the rafters. Confused, Askew looked around for Eddie. He could hear him, but he couldn't see him. He looked over at me on press row. \"Where Moon at?\" Askew said.\nEddie got a huge kick out of that. He got a huge kick out of Vince. Really, Eddie got a huge kick out of life. He didn't get cheated while he was here. But we all feel a little bit cheated today, because he's gone.\nRIP, Eddie.\ntwilkin@timesunion.com • 518-454-5415 • @tjwilkin", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/43/8784093/16/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/42/36/7219126/6/rawImage.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/76/8798095/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/76/8798095/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:36:32.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
