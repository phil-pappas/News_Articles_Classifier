(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — A defiant Chip Kelly defended his coaching strategy and personnel decisions while blaming a 1-3 start on poor execution. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles began the season with Super Bowl aspirations, but are last in the NFC East. They can still bounce back in a division where the other three teams are each 2-2, but they hardly look like a legitimate playoff contender. \nCritics are hammering Kelly for his risky, headline-grabbing offseason moves, and many are questioning his up-tempo offense that leaves the defense on the field far too long. Kirk Cousins led the Redskins on a 15-play, 90-yard touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter against a defense that look tired after being on the field two-thirds of the game. \nBut Kelly sees a team that’s a couple plays from 3-1. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n___ \nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:14:11.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
