The team sent a staffer to get the ball on Wednesday morning and verified that it was in fact the ball hit by Schwarber, the Chicago Tribune reported , and put a plexiglass case over the ball to protect it from the elements. David Banks/Getty Images Kyle Schwarber is on fire in the postseason, batting .538 with three homers and five RBI. \n“We were watching and looking. Nobody actually saw where it went at first and then instantly I said ‘There it is, on top of the scoreboard,'” Tom Comings told the Tribune . “I put the picture on Twitter, and pictures from the seventh-inning stretch that clearly shows there was no ball up there then. ... It had to ricochet perfectly to land there.” \nAfter the Cubs clinched with a 6-4 win, Comings told an usher about the ball and was referred to guest relations, the Tribune reported. Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images Kyle Schwarber’s seventh-inning home run jumped off the bat at an estimated 112 mph. \n“They told me they’d send someone to retrieve it, and then they called us back and gave us some stuff as thanks, a (Jon) Lester bobblehead, a thermos lunch bag and an Ernie Banks’ pin,” he told the paper. \nThere won’t be 24-hour security on top of the board, and if Cubs fans really do believe in curses and superstition, they’ll leave it alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:11:16.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
