Dele Alli is the more off-beat one I suppose because he is so young and only just broken into the Tottenham team but we have been very impressed by what we have seen of him.\"\nEngland have already qualified for the finals in France next year following eight straight Group E wins and Hodgson said he was taking both games seriously because he wanted to finish with a perfect record of 10 victories.\n\"I think the game in Lithuania will be the one where if any experimentation or changes take place it will be there, which might damage our chances of getting the perfect 10 but I am prepared to accept that,\" he added.\nEngland play Estonia at Wembley on October 9 and visit Lithuania three days later.
