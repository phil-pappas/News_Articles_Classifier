It was more than just football, It was a very unique time frame in history. It didn’t matter if you were from the East Side of Red Bank or the West Side, everyone was well represented, including Shrewsbury and Little Silver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:06:47.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
