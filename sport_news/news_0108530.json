There's a long-standing debate regarding the different feelings surrounding a blowout loss, or a heartbreaking defeat, where your team led most of the game only to lose at the last minute. \nThe Westwood Cardinals varsity girls' soccer team has been in each of those scenarios this year, but they didn't have to worry about either Oct. 5 when they topped the Dwight Morrow Maroon Raiders, 5-0, in a Big North Conference crossover game. \nCardinals' head coach Eric Pfeifer knows his team wasn't deflated despite their season's slow start. \n\"Even though we have three losses,\" he said, \"two of the three were close. We didn't play well against Ramsey but in losses to River Dell and Mahwah we were right there. We can compete against these good teams and we have to continue playing like this.\" \n5 FIRST-HALF GOALS \nWestwood dominated the flow of play from the start. The Cardinals had six shots on goal early, but nothing to show for it. Westwood caught a break when junior forward Brooklyn Colon stole the ball and buried her attempt in the right corner of the goal, nine minutes in, to give the Cardinals a 1-0 advantage. \nLess than two minutes later, freshman midfielder/defender Lucie Gehringer put Westwood up two, when she rocketed a shot to the right center of the goal. The Cardinals stretched their lead to three when sophomore midfielder Nicolette Lombardi took a rebound off a shot in the box and found the back of the net, with roughly 26 minutes remaining in the first half. \nAfter the game Lombardi talked about where she'd like to see improvement from Westwood. \n\"Defensively, we have to connect on passes and continue to go to the ball more often,\" she said. \nGehringer tallied her second score of the contest by chipping her attempt to the center of the goal, over Dwight Morrow's junior goalkeeper, Brianna David. With just under 13 minutes to go freshman forward Sarah Levy snuck her shot in the right side, under a diving David to give the Cardinals a 5-0 lead. \nGAME CUT SHORT \nDwight Morrow's best attempt came in the second half, with just under 25 minutes to go in the game. Senior Anna Puchalski shot the ball just right of the post. \nThe game was called with 13:12 to go in the second half, when a Dwight Morrow defender was hit hard in the head with the ball, off an attempted cross from a Westwood midfielder. \nAfter the game was called the doctor assured Maroon Raiders head coach Jaclyn Jano that the player would be fine. \nWestwood still has their sights set high. Senior Bella Guerriero spoke about one specific goal that hasn't been achieved by the Cardinals' in six years. \n\"Our big goal is to have our first state game at home,\" Guerriero said. \"We also want to continue to win and bring a lot of positivity on and off the field.\" \nThe Cardinals are now 3-4-1 overall, while the Maroon Raiders fell to 0-7 overall. \nJano said before the game that the record makes it look worse than it is. The Maroon Raiders have not found that elusive first win yet but they are rebuilding this season, with a roster featuring only three seniors. \nPfeifer said he doesn't want to think too far ahead yet. He's focused only on what his team is doing that day to better themselves. \n\"We have daily goals,\" he said. \"Those are things that you can control, like hard work and effort. Most times, the effort and hard work are there but the wins and losses don't correlate. In terms of our record, I'd like us to be in a better spot, but we are working. We're gaining momentum and we are getting better with each practice and game.\" \nEmail: baumuller@northjersey.com Â© 2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:15:01.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
