She even addressed those infamous remarks about male-fighter Floyd Mayweather, who has a reputation for not treating women so nicely.\nWe have as hard a time as The Tonight Show host does believing that Floyd doesn't know who Ronda Rousey is, and we're willing to bet that if there ever happens to be a chance encounter between the two, it's not only a verbal smackdown that Ronda will be delivering.\n• Ronda Rousey discusses her sex symbol status\nRonda went on to do a little trash talking about her upcoming opponent, Holly Holm, and wasted no time challenging Jimmy to a rematch on Mario Cart, post fight and post rehab for his infamous hurt finger.\nAnd while all of that is good and well, let's be honest—did you even hear a word that Ronda was saying?
