LOUIS â€” St. Louis Rams defensive end Chris Long is week to week with a right knee injury and the team anticipates guard Rodger Saffold will miss some time with a shoulder injury.\nCoach Jeff Fisher said Monday that Long's injury is a result of hyperextension, but that ligament damage has been ruled out, so Fisher considered it good news.\nSaffold injured his right shoulder and was undergoing testing for potential labrum issues. He underwent surgery on the left shoulder in the offseason.\nThe Rams released running back Trey Watts, who returned last week after a four-week suspension. Fisher said the team intends to sign Watts to the practice squad if he clears waivers.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:28:14.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
