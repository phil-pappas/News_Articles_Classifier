Joe Sienkiewicz / Gannett Wisconsin Media \nIt’s become commonplace that coaches sometimes get doused with a huge bucket of water or some kind of sports drink after a historical win. \nBut even after Fond du Lac was able to hold off Hortonville for a 26-21 victory last week, clinching at least a share of the VFA South title — the program’s first since sharing the 2002 Fox Valley Association crown with Oshkosh North — Cardinals’ head coach Mike Gnewuch walked off the field with his clothes completely dry. \nWell, at least for now. \n“I think it’s going to take a little more before they get me with that,” Gnewuch said. “This is a hungry group and they are not satisfied with the possibility of sharing the conference title.” \nThe Cardinals will get that chance to secure the outright title at Fruth Field today when it hosts a dangerous Wisconsin Rapids team. The Red Raiders have lost their last two games but come in needing a win to keep their playoff hopes alive. \nGnewuch and his coaches were reminding the Cardinals of that this week in practice, as well as pointing out what a win over Rapids will earn them. \n“We’ve been talking how we want to be selfish and we want it all to ourselves. It’s given the kids a little extra motivation,” Gnewuch said. “We also know that Rapids is really playing for their life right now so we know we are going to get a fired up Wisconsin Rapids team. We’re expecting them to come out with a lot of energy and emotion and we’re going to try to battle that and play our football.” \nBeing able to call themselves conference champions was always a part of the plan when Gnewuch and his staff took over a struggling program in 2012. \nThe Cardinals had won just one game during the 2011 season but are now one win away from winning an outright conference title and two victories from capping a perfect regular season. \n“Initially when we came in, it was get the program in order and qualify for the playoffs,” Gnewuch said. “Then you want to be in the upper part of the conference and win a playoff game. And the next step is, win conference and win a couple of playoff games. We’re following the progression pretty well.” \nUp for grabs \nWith just two weeks left in the regular season, the seven-team Flyway Conference has a grand total of one team that has secured its entry into the WIAA postseason. One. \nHowever, five teams remain alive in pursuit of those precious playoff berths meaning the next eight days are going to see plenty of intense battles as teams look for the needed four wins to clinch a playoff spot or three wins to become playoff eligible. \nDefending state champion St. Mary’s Springs is in the best position to join Omro in representing the Flyway in the playoffs. The Ledgers are playoff eligible — they will finish no worse than .500 in conference play — and can officially qualify with a win in either of its next two games. \nMayville and Winnebago Lutheran, who play Saturday in Fond du Lac, each stand at 2-2 with two conference games left meaning if either wins out they are automatically qualified, while a split makes them playoff eligible and likely gets them in. \nLomira sits at 2-3 in league play with just a Week 9 contest at Winnebago Lutheran left to get them in, while Laconia needs to upend St. Mary’s Springs on Saturday night and then beat North Fond du Lac in the regular-season finale to become eligible. \nFive of a Kind \nFond du Lac came up with a huge road win last week at Hortonville and now are one win away from securing a conference title. Road victories are so important but not easy to come by. Here are the top five area teams, by winning percentage on the road in the regular season since 2011. \n•1. St. Mary’s Springs (.952 winning percentage, 20-1): The Ledgers have been near perfect, with the only blemish the loss at Omro a few weeks back. \n•2. Laconia (.578, 11-8): All four of the Spartans wins in the 2014 season came on the road where they finished 4-0. \n•3. (tie) Fond du Lac (.500, 11-11): The Cardinals may only be at .500 but have won their last eight regular-season road games. \n•3. (tie) Winnebago Lutheran (.500, 11-11): The Vikings best mark over the past five seasons was last year’s 3-1 record on the road. \n•5. Campbellsport (.476, 10-11): The Cougars have lost their last four road games to fall under the .500 mark. \nTop 5 \nEach week I will rank what I feel are the top 5 teams in the area. These rankings are not based on head-to-head competition (No. 1 team would beat No. 2 team), rather it will be gauging how they would stack up against teams in their own division. With that said, here are the Week 8 rankings. \n•1. Fond du Lac (7-0): Impressive season for the Cardinals is long way from being over. \n•2. St. Mary’s Springs (5-2): The Ledgers bounced back with a convincing win over WLA last week. \n•3. Oakfield (6-1): Senior quarterback Tyler Burbach has the Oaks clicking on offense. \n•4. Winnebago Lutheran (4-3): Important week for the Vikings with upstart Mayville coming to town. \n•5. Lomira (4-3): The Lions step out of the Flyway this week to take on a good Random Lake squad. \nSteve Clark: sclark@gannett.com or follow on Twitter at @skcreno27 Read or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1LkVJ2B TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:11:33.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
