They went all out on Oklahoma, regularly sending at least one extra defender at quarterback Baker Mayfield.\nThe aggressive approach resulted in six sacks, one fewer than Texas posted in its first five games, in a 24-17 upset of the 10th-ranked Sooners.\nThe pressure confounded the Sooners early. They managed only 15 yards in the first quarter and 85 in the first half.\n\"It wasn't like they were outmanning us,\" Mayfield said. \"They were bringing five-man pressures inside. They would bring a different guy here and there, and early on it got to us.\"\nThe Longhorns surpassed their previous season high in sacks -- three against Oklahoma State -- with four in the first half.\nNot bad for a Texas team that ranked eighth in the Big 12 in total defense and ninth in pass defense.\nSeveral players said that Strong's simple message during the week -- \"We're going to win\" -- inspired confidence.\n\"That's all we needed to hear,\" said freshman linebacker Malik Jefferson from Mesquite Poteet. \"We were focused, everybody bonded, and we knew what we needed to do. That just shows you how good we can be when we put our minds to it.\"\nThe Longhorns were tipped off by OU tackle Josiah St. John changing his stance on pass plays.\n\"That's on me,\" St. John said. \"I'm a senior, and that's something I can't do. Nothing else really to say about it.\"\nThe Longhorns dominated the line of scrimmage. They limited OU to 67 rushing yards on 37 carries for a 1.8-yard average.\nOU's inability to run played into UT's hands. With the Sooners dazed, the Longhorns applied a similar physical approach on offense, running for 313 yards. They took a 14-0 lead and limited OU to a field goal in the first half.\nAlthough the Sooners put together drives of 87 and 75 yards in the second half, Texas' defense took charge down the stretch. After Samaje Perine's 1-yard touchdown cut UT's lead to 24-17 with eight minutes left, the Sooners got the ball back with 6:05 remaining.\nBut Mayfield got sacked twice -- by Ford and Naashon Hughes -- and Oklahoma punted. The Longhorns then ran out the clock.\nJefferson led UT with two sacks, causing a loss of 12 yards. Poona Ford had 11/2 sacks for minus-13 yards.\n\"It was just a different mind-set, and all week long we talked about we were going to pressure,\" Strong said. \"I guarantee you we pressured them early every snap. Maybe played three downs of space defense, but other than that the pressure was coming because we wanted to get the ball out of the quarterback's hands, make him make bad decisions and stop the run.\"\nTwitter: @BillNicholsDMN\n2015 AT&T Red River Showdown Texas 24, Oklahoma 17\nBox score\nCowlishaw: Texas' upset of Oklahoma alters narrative for Longhorns coach Charlie Strong\n5 memorable moments from Texas' big win in the Red River Showdown\nPhotos: Charlie Strong gets lifted up by team, wears Golden Hat; Longhorns celebrate with fans\nPregame photos: Fans pose by Big Texas as Texas and Oklahoma prepare for Red River Showdown\nTwitter reaction to Texas' upset of Oklahoma: Kevin Durant says 'Sorry NOklahoma'\nAttendance decreases, fails to crack 92,000 for first time since Cotton Bowl capacity increased\nTexas coverage Carlton: Embarrassment at TCU left Texas 'ticked off,' ready for redemption\nHow Texas' D-line took advantage of OU senior lineman's repeated mistake to make life tough for Sooners' QB Mayfield\nFive Thoughts: How Texas pulled off upset of Oklahoma\nCharlie Strong wears Golden Hat, Texas players throw coach in air after upset of Oklahoma\nPhoto: Texas Longhorn fans turn Oklahoma Sooners fan's car into trash can\nTwitter goes right for Longhorns, rapper Lil B lifts curse\nTexas quotable: 'Today was our day'\nUT's Malik Jefferson on Bevo's absence: 'It was weird because that's tradition and everybody loves that guy'\nHorns' Foreman tops 100-yard mark again\nUT's Malik Jefferson posts first two career sacks\nUT's Swoopes finding niche on short-yardage plays\nCharlie Strong's message for Gov.
