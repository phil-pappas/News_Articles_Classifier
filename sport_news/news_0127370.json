Spezza made it 3-2 with 4:30 left, moments after Kari Lehtonen stopped Nail Yakupov on a breakaway. Lehtonen made his season debut after backing up Antti Niemi in the first two games. The Stars had 52 shots, their most since Feb. 3, 1990, in a 7-6 loss to Philadelphia. Spezza finished off the hat trick with an empty-net goal. McDavid, selected No. 1 overall in the June draft, scored in the second period to pull the Oilers even at 2 after they had fallen behind 2-0. McDavid almost scored Edmonton’s first goal when he appeared to tip a shot by defenseman Oscar Klefbom, who got credit for the goal. But McDavid didn’t have to wait much longer, redirecting a long shot by Andrej Sekera past Lehtonen less than 2 minutes later midway through the second period. \nSharks 5, Capitals 0 \nWASHINGTON \nMartin Jones made 31 saves for his second straight shutout and San Jose took advantage of Alex Ovechkin’s absence from Washington’s lineup. The Sharks improved to 3-0-0 and have outscored their opponents 12-1. Jones allowed a goal on the first shot he faced this season, but has blanked opponents for the following 178 minutes, 11 seconds. Matt Nieto and Chris Tierney each had a goal and an assist, and Joe Thornton, Mike Brown and Tomas Hertl added goals.Ovechkin missed the game because of personal reasons. The Capitals sent out a note on Twitter about 35 minutes before the game saying the Russian star would not play. \nPredators 3, Devils 1 \nNEWARK, N.J. \nPekka Rinne made 22 saves and Nashville ran its season-opening winning streak to three with a victory over struggling New Jersey. Roman Josi had a power-play goal in the first period and added a short-handed empty netter in the third. Eric Nystrom also had an empty-net goal for the Predators, off to their best start since 2010-11. Rinne has played a major role in that success, allowing only two goals so far. Playing his club-record 384th game, he lost his shutout when Kyle Palmieri scored on a power play with 1:40 left. \nPanthers 4, Hurricanes 1 \nRALEIGH, N.C. \nConnor Brickley scored his first NHL goal, Alexsander Barkov gave Florida a two-goal lead 50 seconds later in the third period and Panthers beat Carolina. Nick Bjugstad opened the scoring in the first period, former Hurricanes forward Jussi Jokinen added an empty-net goal with 1:47 left, and Al Montoya made 25 saves to help Florida improve to 2-1-0. Jaromir Jagr assisted on Barkov’s goal for his 1,809th career point. \nJets 4, Rangers 1 \nNEW YORK \nBrian Little scored twice, Michael Hutchinson made 40 saves and Winnipeg beat New York to finish 3-1-0 in its openging trip.
