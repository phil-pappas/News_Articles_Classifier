Scearce says Joplin's city attorney told the council David Wallace's efforts to secure $1.4 million in EDA grant money would need to be compensated. The money is being used to build a new library.\nScearce says because the city won a $1.4 million lawsuit against Wallace Bajjali, it cancels the amount the city owes the defunct master redeveloper.\n\"In the State of Missouri, when you owe me money and I owe you money, it offsets. If they are equal amounts. If they're not, someone has to pay the difference. These are equal amounts,\" says Scearce.\nBut according to Scearce, some city officials are willing to ignore the offsetting judgment. The city would allow Wallace's backer, Prime, to redevelop $1.4 million of Joplin land, letting Prime reclaim what Wallace owed them over time. The land that would be given to Prime is to the east of Joplin's new library.\nScearce says he doesn't agree with the city giving Prime land to pay Wallace Bajjali's debt.\n\"It's my opinion that there are members of the council who are desperate to see something take place. I believe something will take place there eventually, if it deserves to take place there. Let the free market decide on whether or not something will happen there,\" says Scearce.\nJoplin's mayor says he can't talk about details of the city's talks with Prime. But the mayor did say he hopes there is a resolution with Prime by the middle of this month.\nJoplin City Attorney Peter Edwards did not return our calls for comment on this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:16:03.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
