It’s a nice idea. It just happens that this season, it’s not entirely true.\nNot only are there few turnarounds so far, but the best teams with the best quarterbacks are pulling away from the pack at a historic pace.\nNFL Coverage\nIs Your NFL Season Already Over? A Quiz The Patriots’ White Whale: Praise From Bill Belichick Drew Brees and the Backup Quarterback Olympics Why the NFL Has a Quarterback Crisis Don’t expect that to change. The NFL’s best teams have separated themselves to such an extent that there’s a good chance half of the playoff field is already locked up.\nThrough five weeks, six teams are undefeated, the highest number since the league introduced bye weeks in 1990. In the bye-week era, 45 of the 51 teams that were undefeated through five weeks went on to make the playoffs, according to Stats LLC. Which means the 5-0 Denver Broncos, Cincinnati Bengals, Atlanta Falcons and Green Bay Packers are already in the postseason fast lane.\nGiven that 18 of the 20 teams to go 4-0 through Week 5 due to an early bye also advanced to the playoffs, it’s a fair bet the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers will be there too.\nThe flip side to having so many great teams is that there are fewer good ones. Not since 1992 have just 12 teams had winning records at this point of the season. Some of these teams could prove to be more fluke than fact. But it’s also possible that the 12 teams that currently have winning records are the same ones we’ll be watching in January.\nThe obvious explanation is that the six undefeated teams have good quarterbacks. That’s true, of course. But the common thread isn’t so much how these passers have fared on the field. It’s how they’ve allowed their teams to construct their rosters: By treating the quarterback position as an afterthought.\nGreen Bay’s Aaron Rodgers, Denver’s Peyton Manning, Cincinnati’s Andy Dalton, Atlanta’s Matt Ryan, Carolina’s Cam Newton and New England’s Tom Brady are all locked into their starting positions. They are healthy and under contract. This level of certainty means their teams can direct their attention to everything else.\nUnlike the Cleveland Browns, say, they aren’t locked into an unending cycle of chasing a good quarterback with high draft picks and big free-agent dollars. Unlike the Seattle Seahawks, they weren’t forced to dump useful players out of training camp in an effort to clear salary-cap space for quarterback Russell Wilson’s new contract.\nThese teams grappled with the reality that their quarterbacks must be paid long before the season started. Rodgers counts $18 million against Green Bay’s salary cap, but his contract—which runs through 2019—allows the Packers to turn their attention toward other useful pieces. Like an offensive line.\nMore than 15% of Green Bay’s salary cap dollars go toward linemen, which is in the upper third of the league. The result is that in the midst of what league observers have called a historically bad year for offensive linemen, Rodgers has been sacked just eight times.\nThe luxury of being settled at the quarterback spot meant four of the six undefeated teams could spend their first-round picks on a defensive player in this year’s draft. The Bengals and the 4-1 Arizona Cardinals, meanwhile, are so well-rounded that they selected offensive linemen despite having no immediate need for a starter.\nThe other lesson from the NFL’s undefeated six is that once you have an established quarterback, you’ll need a running back. The Falcons learned that the hard way—after roaring success in the early years of Matt Ryan’s tenure in Atlanta, they hadn’t had a reliable rushing threat since Michael Turner dominated in 2011. So the Falcons spent mid-round picks on running backs in back-to-back years. Now, second-year running back Devonta Freeman has 405 yards and an NFL-high eight rushing touchdowns in five games. In fact, all six undefeated teams have a runner averaging over 4.4 yards per carry (in Carolina, that player just happens to be Newton.)\nThe good news for the NFL’s bad teams is that being unbeaten isn’t always an accurate Super Bowl predictor. Since 1990, just eight times has an undefeated team through Week 5 gone on to win the Super Bowl. But looking at this year’s top-heavy NFL, it’s tough to imagine any of the have-nots making a run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:18:26.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
