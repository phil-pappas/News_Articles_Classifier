The team says he had a meniscal tear repaired.\nThe loss of Keith, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy last season for playoff MVP, is a huge blow for the Stanley Cup champions. They play in one of the NHL's toughest divisions, and every point could make a difference at the end of the year.\nKeith is likely headed for long-term injured reserve, giving the Blackhawks some cap relief. Lubomir Visnovsky, a veteran defenseman who was with the team during training camp, could be brought back, or they could promote someone from the minors.\n Videos From ", "external_links": ["http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/world/what-killed-man-who-bit-another-passenger-aer-ling/nn6Pg/", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/js/handlebars-v3.0.0.js\\", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/daytondailynews/hbs/cinesport_grid_items.hbs", "http://www.krmg.com/news/news/national/teen-who-built-homemade-clock-visits-white-house/nn6Lf/", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/cache/cacher.php?saveas=ddn_cinesport_main&format=rss&json_url=", "http://www.wftv.com/news/news/national/cop-comforts-lost-boy-photo-goes-viral/nn6N8/", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/php/simple_get_file.php?url=", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://www.wsbtv.com/gallery/news/national/photos-amy-schumer-salma-hayek-shine-elle-women-ho/gCXfP/", "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js\\", "http://www.news965.com/news/news/national/boycottstarwarsvii-critics-claim-film-anti-white/nn6MS/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:12:30.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
