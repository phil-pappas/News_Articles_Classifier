You look at the 49ers and you do not see a team on the decline. You see Joe Montana at quarterback and Jerry Rice catching his passes and Roger Craig in the backfield and Charles Haley rushing the passer and Ronnie Lott headhunting in the secondary.\nYou take care of business the way the Patriots do, the way the Patriots did against the poor Jaguars. The Giants, of course, are not the Patriots. But if you lose at home to the Jim Tomsula 49ers one week after Buffaloing the Bills, you reveal yourself to be a pretender.\n“They embarrassed us last year,” Justin Pugh said. “We gave up a bunch of sacks to ’em. It’s first-and-goal, we have four chances to score and we don’t score.\n“This is a game I think for us we gotta prove to those guys that we’re a different team from last year ’cause they think we’re the same team, too. Everyone thinks it’s a trap game — we got something to prove this week to that D-line, that front seven.”\nWell, it’s a lesser D-line and a lesser front seven, mostly because of retirements, but no matter. The NFC East is wide open, and if you plan on being division champs, you beat the teams you are supposed to beat, especially in your own building.\n“The past two years, we haven’t finished strong, or we haven’t started strong,” Pugh said. “So we gotta make sure we continue to go throughout. Two and two is not where we want to be, .500 is not getting you in the playoffs.”\nFor the past three seasons, the Giants have loomed as a trap game for would-be contenders. It’s an insult and indignity of the highest order for a franchise for which playoffs are the only expectation.\n“I know that this team is still hungry, and our No. 1 goal is to win the division, so right now we’re in control of our own destiny,” Prince Amukamara said. “After watching film, the 49ers aren’t a 1-3 team. … We know that they’re gonna come out here desperate for a win, but we’re desperate for another one also.”\nJust as the Giants believe they were not an 0-2 team, they believe they’re not a 2-2 team either. Amukamara, asked what is driving the Giants’ desperation, said: “I think ’cause we know what it felt like to be 0-2, and I don’t think guys want to go that road anymore. We give other teams credit, but we felt like we beat ourselves the most. If a team’s gonna beat us, they’re gonna have to beat us without making any mistakes.”\nColin Kaepernick has been having accuracy and confidence problems. When the 49ers are forced to play catch-up, running back Carlos Hyde is no longer a factor. The defense is a shell of its former self. Tomsula is a rookie. Their last two road disasters: 43-18 in Pittsburgh, 47-7 in Arizona. You do not build momentum by playing down to the level of your opponents.\nEli Manning and Weston Richburg Photo: Getty Images “You mention trap game — we’re not even in a position to think like that,” Weston Richburg said. “So this is the biggest game of the season right now. They’ve lost three straight, so it’s up to us to match their intensity, then take it to another level, ’cause this is not just any other game for us.”\nThe Giants can ride the swagger that would accompany a three-game winning streak, with the Eagles on the road and Cowboys at home following the Niners.\n“We’ve got an attitude,” Richburg said. “We could have easily, after those first two games, easily just said, ‘It’s over,’ and just showed up every day just going through the motions. But we’ve really kind of self-governed within the locker room. It’s been players getting on other players to get after it. Us up front, we have a great group. If somebody’s slacking, we’re able to kind of bring each other along, which is something we didn’t have last year, and something I think is gonna take us to new heights this year.”\nRichburg referenced the halftime locker room in Buffalo.\n“I think we’ve had the lead every game at halftime. … We came in the locker room, talking to each other, really getting each other amped up, kind of not waiting for coaches to say something, but us taking the initiative,” Richburg said.\nIt is imperative that the team’s leaders help Tom Coughlin trumpet what the lesser team does well, and the perils of letting your guard down in an Any Given Sunday league.\n“They’re in a more desperate situation than we are,” Cullen Jenkins said, “and anytime a team gets in a desperate situation, good teams respond, and the 49ers are a good team. They’ve had an unfortunate start to the year, so you can’t look at their record and think that that’s what type of team they are. You have to understand that this is a quarterback that’s been to the Super Bowl, this is a quarterback that’s been to multiple NFC Championship games. This is a team that’s done the same. We can’t be caught up just looking at their record and saying, ‘Aw well, this team isn’t that tough,’ because they actually are, so if you’re not mentally in tune to how good that this team is and can be, then it can become a trap game because you can start focusing on what lies after, the games you got coming up in the division and all that stuff.\n“We’ve gotta go out and try to get this win because for us, we’re still desperate to try to get over .500. And that’d be big for us. So we have to get to 3-2 and that’s what we need to be worried about.”\n  justin pugh ,  new york giants ,  prince amukamara ,  san francisco 49ers ,  weston richburg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:23:11.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
