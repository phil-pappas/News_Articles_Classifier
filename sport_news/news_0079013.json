Cary Edmondson/USA TODAY Sports Oct 19, 2015 at 9:45p ET 0Shares \nGREEN BAY -- A lack of carries for Eddie Lacy with the Green Bay Packers isn't necessarily solely tied to how the running back feels after he sprained his right ankle earlier this season. \nYes, Lacy is playing hurt, coach Mike McCarthy said Monday, but most of rest of the team is, too. \nThe upcoming bye week offers a much-needed break for Lacy and other sore Packers. \n\"He's beat up, this week will help him,\" McCarthy said, though adding, \"I don't see conditioning as an issue.\" \nLacy got just four carries for 3 yards in the 27-20 win on Sunday against the San Diego Chargers. James Starks , normally the backup, got the start and made quick impressions with a 5-yard touchdown off a shovel pass and 65-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. \nStarks finished with 10 carries for 112 yards. Lacy said after the game he wasn't limited, though he thought he might have a reduced role. \n\"When Starks started off and he comes out with a big run right out of the gate, it's hard to shut that down,\" Lacy said Sunday. \"You want to keep going and get what you can get out of it, and he kept rolling.\" \nThe distribution in carries isn't tied to what happens in practice, McCarthy said. At the same time, the veteran Starks has long been a trusted backup in Green Bay, and coaches like the way he has been running. \nStarks offers more of a threat outside the tackles than the bruising Lacy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:46:15.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
