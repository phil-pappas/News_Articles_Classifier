It is momentum the Hornets would like to carry into Thursday's game. \"I hope so (carry momentum into Thursday),\" Jenkins stated. \"I tell you what the team's attitude has been wonderful. The guys came back ready to work. They are upset they didn't complete the task on Saturday. I think they are really looking forward to Thursday night as well. Not just because it's a TV game, but because it's another opportunity for them to go out and give a collective effort to come home with a victory.\" \"There's some excitement there because of the second half push and fight like they did. I've always said this is a resilient group and I thought if we can put a complete game together or we can put a half together where we didn't have any team-inflicted wounds people would be surprised at what we would be able to do. I think we surprised some people the second half of last week's game.\" UAPB (1-4/0-3 SWAC) will look for their first conference win of the season against the Hornets and have had a week off to rest and prepare for the game while ASU will be playing their fourth game in 18 days. Jenkins said, \"I think it's a double-edge sword. Their team is coming off a bye and will be a little bit more rested and probably got some healing up done and got one or two guys back that had a couple of nicks.\" \"As far as us, it gives us a chance to keep our timing with the short turnaround. It causes you to have to really grind out and think how you are going to prepare your team's body and mind and your game plan as well. We have an exceptional group of coaches and I think we've exemplified we can have our team ready to play in a short turn around.\" The Hornets know even with UAPB's record it is not something they are taking very lightly and expect a tough outing on the Golden Lions field. \"I don't think their record matches up to the type of ball club they are,\" Jenkins said. \"You have to start with Monte Coleman their head coach. Anytime you say his name you know the end definition of it is his true name and that is a real man. I know he has had success in the profession, playing and coaching. I know he has passed a lot of those characteristics and experience to his players.\" \"When you look at them they have some weapons. So they are definitely a team to pay attention to and not look at their record. We are going to put as much attention into them as with anyone else and hopefully we can keep them from hitting their turnaround point.\" The kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. The game can also be heard on the ASU Hornets Sports Network and on HSRN Satellite Radio Sirius 108 and XM 201.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:23:31.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
