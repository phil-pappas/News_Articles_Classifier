The team you're going to face in the quarter-finals is potentially a team that could go all the way and win this World Cup,\" he said. \n\"We've got to expect to play all the top nations if we want to win this thing and both of those two teams are pretty damn good sides. \n\"It's going to be an exciting game when they play, and we'll play who we have to play and prepare accordingly.\" \nFoster said the All Blacks would not waste time worrying about the outcome of the Ireland-France match. \n\"We're just focussing and worrying about beating Tonga, playing well against them and whatever happens the following week will happen. \n\"We have spent energy looking at both of them but who we want to play, well we'll wait and see.\" Copyright AFP (Agence France-Presse), 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:58:49.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
