Junior Aaron Wood had the second-lowest score for the Irish at 78.\nIn the Division II tournament at NorthStar Golf Club in Sunbury, Bexley senior Cameron Karmia shot 2-under 70 for first place among individuals. With a 306 total, Bexley trails defending champion Canton Central Catholic by four strokes.\nFisher Catholic coach Trevor Saffell said his team put a poor round behind it.\n“We can play better, but we kept plugging away,” he said. “We’re in a good situation for the second round. I’m looking forward to our guys shooting better. It was real tough today. There were a lot of high numbers.”\nBlake Saffell had birdies on Nos. 5, 12 and 15, but he said the key to his round was saving par with good approaches. He was not consistent off the tee.\n“I had good placements and got a lot of pars,” he said. “Sometimes you wanted to push (for birdie), but you had to give yourself a shot at par because par was a good score. Absolutely, we can play better as a team. I thought we were only average.\n“Now, we have another opportunity.”\nBexley also thought it left way too many potential pars and birdies on the course. It played the 18th hole in 8-over par.\n“We’ve been preparing for this tournament the entire season,” 12th-year Bexley coach Jim Ryan said. “I’ve coached a lot of teams, but none has been as ready for this as this team. This tournament is not about getting ribbons for participation. There is a purpose to these players’ steps.”\nKarmia, who leads Canton Central Catholic’s Evan Jenkins by two shots, had birdies on Nos. 1, 13 and 15. He credited his father for getting his mind ready for a difficult day.\n“It came down to focus,” Karmia said. “After the first shot, I realized I could play this game. My dad said, ‘You’ve done this 100 times, so just play another round of golf.’ ”\nFreshman Trevor Binau shot 78 for the second-lowest score for Bexley. Next were Hunter Roberts and Davis Williams, who each shot 79.\nHartley senior Chris Williard is tied for fifth after a 76.\nIn the girls Division II tournament on the Gray Course at Ohio State, Bexley senior Liza Weisman shot 79 to trail Sammi Blackburn of Monroe by five strokes. Fairbanks is tied for eighth as a team.\nmznidar@dispatch.com\n@MarkZnidar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:26:14.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
