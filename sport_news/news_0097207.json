Pulaski Robinson tried to gain a first down on four occasions, but the Sand Lizards stopped them four times and got the ball over on downs.Then there was Dardanelle senior Chris Kershner, who scored six touchdowns, including TD runs of 78 and 84 yards and returned a 30-yard interception for another TD.All that resulted in a 44-20 win by the top-ranked Sand Lizards over the third-ranked Senators at Bob Keenan Field.Dardanelle (8-0, 5-0 4A-4) controls its own destiny with regular-season games remaining against Dover next week at Keenan Field and at Subiaco in Week 10. The Sand Lizards also controlled their own destiny over Pulaski Robinson (7-1, 4-1) from the opening kickoff.Dardanelle’s first possession was nearly six minutes long and kept the Senators offense off the field — another key point Price said the Lizards needed to be successful.Kershner scored his first touchdown, from 11 yards out, with 6:12 to go in the first quarter. Timo Martiniz hit the point-after kick for a 7-0 lead.Pulaski Robinson’s first possession ended with a fumble recovered by Caden Brown at the 35-yard line. The first of several penalties by the Senators gave Dardanelle a first-and-goal at the 7. Dakota Rowland got to the 1, then Kershner took it across the goal line for the touchdown. The Sand Lizards led 14-0 with 4:12 still left in the first quarter.Dardanelle’s defense forced an incomplete pass on Pulaski Robinson’s first failed fourth down. After taking over at the 22, Kershner got loose and scampered into the end zone for the touchdown. Martiniz made it 21-0 with 7:16 to go in the second quarter.The Senators missed another fourth-down pass and turned the ball over to the Sand Lizards again. For the first time, Dardanelle had to settle for a Martiniz field goal and eventually a 24-0 lead at halftime.Pulaski Robinson took the third-quarter kickoff and this time scored on fourth down. University of Arkansas commitment A.J. Hammonds took the option pitch and went in for the 2-yard touchdown. The 2-point pass was no good, and the Senators trailed 24-6 at the 6:19 mark of the third quarter.The Sand Lizards answered with an 84-yard touchdown run by Kershner and a 31-6 lead after the Martiniz PAT.Pulaski Robinson committed not one, but two penalties after first and goal and was held out of the end zone again by Dardanelle’s defense. The Sand Lizards started at their 4 and appeared to score again, but Kershner fumbled at the 1 and the Senators recovered Dardanelle’s lone turnover.Senators quarterback Brennan Johnson’s pass was intercepted by Kershner, who returned it 30 yards for a touchdown. Martiniz put the Sand Lizards on top 38-6.Johnson scored his first touchdown with 9:11 left in the fourth quarter on an 8-yard run, capping a 99-yard drive. Pulaski Robinson trailed 38-13.Kershner scored touchdown No. 6 on a 15-yard run with 7:23 to go in the fourth quarter, and Dardanelle led 44-13 after the blocked PAT.Hammonds scored his second touchdown with 3:56 to go after a 16-yard run. The PAT closed the gap to 44-20.The Sand Lizards will honor their seniors next week.
