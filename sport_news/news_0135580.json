Princess Anne has wrestled away one of those spots the last few years and now Maury may seize the second spot. Princess Anne boasts two of the best players in Virginia in senior outside Chase Howard and senior setter Courtland Scharenborg. Maury has a dynamic duo of its own in senior outside Shane Limbaugh and senior setter Charlie Seerden.\nENCORE\nThe boys volleyball Class of 2015 will be a tough act to follow. All-Tidewater players went off to play at Hawaii, Stanford and George Mason among others. Seniors Chase Howard and Courtland Scharebourg (Princess Anne), Shane Limbaugh (Maury), Brad Creamer (Cox) and Bryce Gatling (Norview) are next up for Division I offers.\nREALIGNMENT\nWhile the girls teams are divvied up into six divisions, the boys postseason gets confusing. With only South Hampton Roads and Richmond schools playing boys volleyball, the 6A division is slim — so anemic there wasn’t a region tournament last season; the teams went from the conference tournament to the state quarterfinals. And the bottom four division are grouped (4A-1A) into one state tournament. Area boys coaches continue to gripe over the watered down competition.\n___\nTOP 10 TEAMS IN SOUTH HAMPTON ROADS\n1. Princess Anne\nWith two of the state’s top players – Chase Howard and Courtland Scharenborg – the Cavaliers aim to win their third straight state championship. The offense could see some new wrinkles as fourth-year setter Scharenbourg may take some swings. Howard is the powerful outside hitter who will also handles serve-receive. “There’s a lot of expectation in Chase and Courtland,” coach Jeff Kinser said. Should Scharenbourg move outside, Sean Calida is the back-up setter and has been steadily improving. Antonio Greer and Andrew Butler provide options in the middle, while Matt Gish is a lefty on the right side. Noah Banasiewicz and Connor Dooren may also contribute.\n2. Maury\nThe most successful Norfolk program ever could reach new heights this season behind star outside Shane Limbaugh and setter Charlie Seerden. “I told my guys, ‘You’re gonna have a target on you,’” coach Jeff Pye said. The Commodores will need to fortify the middle to compete with 5A rival Princess Anne. Sophomore and first-year player Langston Godwin, at 6-foot-6, could be the solution. Sophomore OH Andrew Lyons, sophomore libero Ben Herndon, senior middle Ashlar Peronnet and junior opposite James Whitham provide depth.\n3. Cox\nLosing three All-Tidewater players — Player of the Year Brett Rosenmeier (Hawaii), Russell Dervay (Stanford) and Will Calaman (George Mason) — hurts, but the Falcons have a consistent pipeline. Senior do-it-all Brad Creamer, “one of the top recruits in the country,” coach Jason Zuidema said, will step in and lead a team that also includes Chad Dufour, Jake Gibbs, Grant Gilden, Greg Hahn and Tyler Gooch. Gilden, a setter, will fill the big shoes left by Dervay.\n4. Ocean Lakes\nAfter rebuilding for several years, the Dolphins appear primed for a great run. Junior setter Adreyune Husted is the real deal and should connect often with 6-foot-3 middle Derron Watkins. The two played club ball together and gained chemistry. Sean Whiteman is a consistent outside and Colton Demetriou could become one of the area’s best liberos. Not one to oversell, coach Heath Boomer said, “I’m very encouraged about this team.”\n5. Bayside\nLed by Mike King, Max Ebert, Sean Davidson and Luke Martin, the Marlins hope to build on last season’s success, which included a huge win over First Colonial. A well-built team with 12 seniors, one rival coach said they’re “just good all-around.” Bayside made it to the Coastal Conference semifinals last year and could surprise in one of the state’s toughest conferences.\n6. Western Branch\nTransfer Josh Tomovik (Nansemond River) gives the Bruins good pop on the pins. Western Branch alum Jason Parker takes over as coach and inherits a team that lost three-year starting setter Sam Porter to graduation. Chris Cox and Mitchell Hawkins are battling for the open position. Antonio Sargent, Chad Heidelberger and Matt Rudisill, who “will be looked to as the leader in the back row,” Parker said, return.\n7. Grassfield\nFirst-team all-conference and second-team all-state setter Austin Obenour is back to potentially lead the Grizzlies to a second straight state semifinal appearance. Brothers Todd and Tyler Liebig play outside and libero, respectively, while Jack Welch steps in at middle.\n8. Oscar Smith\nEntering his 21st year at the helm, coach Ray Collins has a veteran group. Outsides Atman Soni, Bryson Wright and Marcus White, along with setter Andrew Poirier and middle Hunter Garvin, are all seniors. The Tigers kept 20 players on the team for competition and depth. Sophomore outside Tony Harris and junior libero Bobby Strunc also will contribute.\n9. Great Bridge\nJunior outside Perry Dunkum could be a rising star for the Wildcats. He’s effective from anywhere, including a back-row attack. Senior Jack Popelka provides dependable leadership praised by coach Keith Betts. “He has an uncanny ability to lead the court,” Betts said. Senior setter Jackson Parker, junior middle Jacob Evans and freshman Jason Jones could lead Great Bridge back to the state tournament.\n10. First Colonial\nMatt Hotaling takes over for longtime coach Gary Hodges after 10 seniors graduated. With numerous newcomers, the Patriots may take some time to jel, but Kyle Gibson, Justin Jaffe, Justin Cook and Mason McClendon aim to shorten that wait.\n___\nFIVE PLAYERS TO KNOW\nBrad Creamer, Cox: At 6-4, “Brad can play every position about as good as most people in the state,” coach Jason Zuidema said.\nBryce Gatling, Norview: A bright spot in a middling program, the powerful hitter is drawing major college looks.\nChase Howard, Princess Anne: Possesses arguably the hardest attack in the state and one of the smartest minds – he’s considering Ivy League schools.\nShane Limbaugh, Maury: A starting outside since freshman year, Limbaugh has helped the Maury program rise to the top.\nCourtland Scharenborg, Princess Anne: A dependable setter for two state championship teams, Scharenbourg vies for a third.\n___\nELSEWHERE\nIn Group 6A ...\nGranby coach Richard Woods believes the Comets have “the potential to be something special,” with Waquan Smith, Terry Wiggins, James Woyner and Daniel Ligon. ... David Rochester will provide senior leadership for Landstown , which has “a core group of young men who demonstrate skill, proficiency and awareness,” coach Sheryl Grumney said.\nIn Group 5A ...\nFive basketball players made the Green Run roster, including Deshaun Wade and Sterling Carrington Jr. ... Hickory graduated its entire starting lineup and will count on Cole Bogner, William Boyd, Gavin Slezak, Myles Brown and Dan Johnson.\nIn private schools ...\nCape Henry , led by Andrew Branson, Grayson Browning, Nick GIlbert and Noah Joyce, should have no trouble winning their eighth straight Tidewater Conference title. Only four area private schools play boys volleyball.\nRay Nimmo, 757-446-2364 or ray.nimmo@pilotonline.com; Twitter: @Ray_Nimmo\n 4 photos: Princess Anne's Chase Howard practices Wednesday, Aug. 19, 2015.
