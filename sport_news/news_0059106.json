McKay had served as the peak performance coordinator for the Colorado Rockies' minor league system since September 2012. \nBefore joining the professional ranks, McKay was the head baseball coach at Sacramento City College from 1999-2012, winning eight league titles and one state championship. McKay has also coached in the Cape Cod League and Northwoods League. \nMcKay replaces Chris Gwynn, who stepped down earlier this month as Seattle's farm director. \nSEAHAWKS-INJURIES \nRB Fred Jackson fine after car crash, will play for Seattle \nRENTON, Wash. (AP) - Seattle Seahawks running back Fred Jackson will play Thursday night against San Francisco after being examined by the team following a minor car crash. \nSeattle coach Pete Carroll said Jackson participated in the team's walkthrough Wednesday before departing to face the 49ers. \nCarroll said Jackson addressed the team Wednesday regarding the car accident on Tuesday night near the team's facility. Carroll said he's confident no other players were involved. \nFullback Derrick Coleman, who was reinstated to the roster this week after his involvement in a two-car accident, will not play against the 49ers due to a concussion suffered in that crash. \nCarroll said doctors have not cleared Coleman to return to action. Coleman was arrested for investigation of vehicular assault and hit-and-run and was later released. No charges have been filed. \nTEXAS-NIKE \nAP Source: Texas agrees to 15-year deal with Nike \nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A person with knowledge of the negotiations says Texas has reached a 15-year licensing and apparel deal with Nike Inc. \nThe contract will approach $200 million for the university, which has one of the wealthiest athletic programs in the country, according to the person, who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity because the agreement must still be approved by the school's regents. \nThe deal, which was first reported by the Austin American-Statesman, extends a partnership that dates to 2000. Nike's previous contract included a clause that allowed it to match any offer made by another company. \nBRAZIL-US WOMEN \nCarli Lloyd scores in 85th minute, US ties Brazil 1-1 \nSEATTLE (AP) - Carli Lloyd scored in the 85th minute and the World Cup champion United States women pulled out a 1-1 tie with Brazil on Wednesday night after trailing since the opening moments. \nLloyd got her foot to a cross from defender Meghan Klingenberg and the shot got past goalkeeper Luciana, deflected off the underside of the crossbar and into the net. \nThe U.S. was on the verge of suffering its first home loss in more than a decade. \nBrazilian defender Monica scored on a header off a corner kick in the third minute. The header beat goalkeeper Hope Solo and was the earliest goal allowed by the U.S. in more than two years. \nThe Americans extended their home unbeaten streak to 101 matches, their last loss coming on Nov. 6, 2004, against Denmark in Philadelphia during a post-Olympic victory tour after the 2004 Athens Games. \nTHORNS-MORGAN \nAlex Mogan plays for US while trade rumors swirl \nSEATTLE (AP) - Alex Morgan started for the World Cup champion U.S. team against Brazil on Wednesday night amid reports that she was on the verge of being sent to the expansion Orlando Pride of the National Women's Soccer League. \nMorgan has played with the Portland Thorns for the past three seasons. The new Orlando team was announced Tuesday and will begin play next season. Morgan's husband, Servando Carrasco, plays for Major League Soccer's Orlando City. \nSports Illustrated first reported the deal that would send Morgan and Canadian Kaylyn Kyle to Orlando for the Pride's first pick in the NWSL draft, two international slots, and U.S. national team defender Meghan Klingenberg, currently with the Houston Dash. \nThe Thorns didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. \nThe 26-year-old Morgan is one of the most popular female players in the world. She was on the U.S. team that won the Women's World Cup this summer in Canada. She first made a splash at the London Olympics when she scored the overtime winner for the United States in a semifinal victory over Canada. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
