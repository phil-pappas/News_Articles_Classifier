That’s also the last year HHS has stood at .500 after six games. \nAt halftime, HHS crowned A’Shon Riggins homecoming king and Danielle Zeek queen. \n“Couldn’t be happier with the win,” HHS coach Chad Murphy said. “We went from learning how to win to learning how to be on the other side of the coin playing with a big lead. But really, happy for the kids to get a big win.” \nAfter Oak Hills opened the game with a touchdown, Hamilton owned the rest of the half. \nIsaiah Murph scored on a seven-yard run and Vince Sanford took a pass, broke a tackle and went 52 yards for a score as HHS led 14-6 after one quarter. \nHamilton continued the onslaught in the second quarter, with Riggins scoring on a 29-yard run and Eric Jackson going over from a yard out. \nOak Hills turned the ball over on downs three times in the first half, threw an interception in the end zone and fumbled while falling to 1-4, 0-3 in the Greater Miami Conference. \nThe Highlanders entered with the GMC’s top-rated pass offense, averaging 56 pass attempts a game, but they mixed it up most of the night. Oak Hills ran the ball a season-high 29 times for 112 yards and threw 54 times. Jacob Woycke finished 34-of-54 for 368 yards and four touchdowns but he also threw four interceptions. \n“Our defense stepped up when we needed them,” Murphy said. “Oak Hills is a peculiar defense to get ready for but our defense did a good job.” \nLate in the third quarter, with HHS up 35-6, the Highlanders got rolling. Woycke took one in from three yards out before adding the two-point run to make it 35-14 after three quarters. \nWoycke then hit Brandon Wieck for a 26-yard TD. On the next play, HHS quarterback Steve Cunningham was sacked, fumbled and Ben McGinnis scooped and scored. \nHamilton’s Brandon McKinney ended Oak Hills’ final drive with a sack at the Highlanders’ 40. The Highlanders were out of timeouts and could manage one more play. \n“We have to learn how to play with a lead,” Murphy said. “Instead of putting the pedal to the metal we eased off.” \nCunningham, who entered the contest No. 2 in the GMC behind Woycke, completed 15-of-27 passing for 213 yards and one score. Sanford snared five passes for 102 yards and the Big Blue ran for 110 yards on 33 carriers. \nThe Big Blue, which had 323 yards on 60 plays, travel to Middletown next Friday for the annual Butler Bowl. Oak Hills, which totaled 480 yards on 83 plays, hosts Sycamore.
