(Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Gary Klein Contact Reporter \nA day after requiring sideline medical attention during a football game at Notre Dame, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden was “extremely chipper” during a visit with coaches on campus, interim Coach Clay Helton said Sunday night. \nHelton said Haden had called him Sunday morning to let him know he was doing well and to express support in the aftermath of the Trojans’ 41-31 defeat at South Bend, Ind. \n“And then while we were watching tape with the offensive staff, he came in extremely chipper, gave his full support [and] looked like his regular self,” Helton said during a teleconference with reporters. \nHaden, 62, felt lightheaded, took a knee and was attended to by USC team medical personnel before the Trojans' loss to the No. 14 Fighting Irish. \nHaden, who has a pacemaker, left the stadium during the game and stopped at a local hospital before boarding a private plane for a return to Los Angeles, an athletic department spokesman said Saturday. \nOn Sunday, in a message posted to his Twitter account, Haden wrote that he “checked out fine.” \n“Thanks for all the support. I checked out fine and am feeling great today! Proud of our effort vs ND, came up just short. Beat the Utes!” Haden wrote. \nUSC, which fell to 3-3 after Saturday’s loss, is set to play third-ranked Utah on Saturday at the Coliseum. \nThe Utes defeated Arizona State, 34-18, on Saturday night to improve to 6-0 overall and 3-0 in the Pac-12 Conference. \n“We’re up against another physical team, especially defensively,” Helton said. \nMORE SPORTS NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:05:46.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
