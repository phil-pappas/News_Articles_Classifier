Resilient. Brave. Determined.\nYou can take any of these words and nail it when describing De La Salle senior Madison Young.\nMore tricky would be painting a picture of her in the gym last Thursday as \"the girl awaiting a kidney transplant.\"\nThey could have stood every uniformed player in line, and without a number you wouldn't have had a chance picking her out.\nYoung was just another smiling, enthusiastic, healthy-looking kid.\nNothing seems to rattle her. Well, almost.\nI was able to make her blink for one second when we talked before the \"Match For Madison\" against Mother McAuley. I mentioned the gym decorations, the posters, and the raffles and candy sales being held to help cover her medical bills.\n\"That's a lot of love out there. How does that make you feel?\" I asked.\nThat's when she blinked.\n\"I feel overwhelmed,\" she said, smiling. \"I'm so happy to have all of this support to help me get through this.\"\nGirls Volleyball Notes: Mother McAuley, Kayla Caffey brew up title Tony Baranek Mother McAuley has played through adversity time and again this season.

It was no different at the Glenbard East Autumnfest Classic on Saturday, when junior outside hitter Katie O'Connell went down with a sprained ankle in the semifinals.\nThis time, the Mighty Macs not only played through, they...\n(Tony Baranek) Young expects to play as much as she can in De La Salle's final regular-season matches. Then, when one becomes available, she will have the kidney transplant either at UIC Hospital or at Lurie Children's Hospital.\nAfter a few months of rehab, Madison will hopefully continue what promises to be a normal life, and put to rest an adversity that seemingly came out of nowhere.\nYoung was on the fast track to being one of the frontliners as a middle/outside hitter. She was a major contributor for the Meteors, who won the Palos Courts Summer League.\nShortly after, Young went with her family on a Florida vacation. Three days into the trip she experienced swelling in her ankles. The condition briefly subsided, but flared up again a day after returning home while she was working at her summer job in concessions at White Sox games.\nHer mother, Sandy, brought her to UIC Hospital, where a checkup revealed high blood pressure, anemia and a kidney disease that would require a transplant.\nImagine getting that kind of news when you're only 17.\n\"I can tell you right now in that hospital she almost never cried,\" Sandy Young said. \"She never said, 'Why me?' She never complained. The nurses were amazed. \"I told her, 'You have the right to cry. To be upset.' But she never was.\"\nYoung kept a brave face through a month of intense in-hospital dialysis and treatment. She still undergoes dialysis at home for six hours every night while sleeping.\n\"I was bummed out, but I just kept thinking that I have to keep a positive attitude and this will eventually be over with (following surgery),\" Madison said. \"We've talked to other people who had a transplant a lot of years ago and they're fine now and doing normal things. They told me that I'd have a normal life.\"\nOne of the first things Young wanted to do after coming home was get back on the court. She got her wish shortly after the season started when doctors gave her clearance to play.\nMadison sat on the bench for De La Salle's home match against DePaul on Sept. 3.\n\"I had my phone and during every timeout I'd text my mom real quick and say, 'I don't want to be sitting here watching. I want to be playing,'\" she said.\nThe following week, Madison did play. She's been with the team ever since.\n\"She's been practicing and playing when she's up for it,\" De La Salle coach Anna Marassa said. \"It's inspirational. \"She's taking it much better than we are. We try not to show her how disturbed we are that she has to go through this. But she has not missed a beat. It's all been very positive.\"\nA solid student who takes honors classes in anatomy/physiology and religion, Madison hopes to have a career in criminal psychology. She also wants to play college volleyball.\nThe doctors will say yes. A smart coach somewhere will, too.\nabaranek@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @tbaranek\nPrivacy Policy Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626b0a6/turbine/ct-sta-tony-baranek-column-st-1021-20151020", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562582cd/turbine/ct-sta-girls-volleyball-notes-st-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:01:00.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
