The prevailing opinion with the pigskin public, both in New England and nationally, is Tom Brady & Co. was only warming up for an offensive onslaught it will unleash against the Deflategate-initiating Colts on Sunday night in Indianapolis. It’s still unclear whether the Patriots intentionally schemed to illegally doctor footballs, but what is certain is the Colts fingered their AFC rival. And, for that, the Patriots will surely make these helmeted heroes of the Heartland pay. Or maybe it’s all just a bunch of hot air. That’s the way one prominent Patriot is looking at this seismic showdown. “I really don’t see it any different than each of the other games we’ve played,” offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said Tuesday in a conference call. “I think it’s a very good team, it’s a road game in a hostile environment in a place that’s tough to play on a Sunday night. They’ve got new people, new personnel. “They want to beat us and we want to beat them, it’s not very complicated. I mean that’s the same thing every single week you play in this league. It’s very difficult to get ready for the coaching staff, the schemes they use, the players that are on this team, the environment that you’re going to be competing in and trying to do your job in. And, really, to let anything other than that to kind of creep into your preparation is going to take away your performance.” In other words, the best way to do your job is to stay on point when it comes to preparing, planning and practicing. “I think our focus is going to stay on this, I know mine is,” McDaniels said. “I mean, I don’t really have anything to do with all that stuff and I don’t think anyone in our building really cares a whole lot about it at this point. “I mean, we have a challenge ahead of us. We have a lot of things to do, we have a long work week and we have a lot of things to get caught up on and get our players prepared to do. So we have a great challenge ahead of us. It should be a fun environment to go and play in and I know playing on Sunday night is always exciting. We’re going to go there and try to put forth our best performance and that’s really where our focus is.\" Limited role for Mayo The Patriots drafted Jerod Mayo 10th overall in 2008 and the linebacker proved to be an immediate and dependable hit, racking up at least 100 tackles in each of his first five seasons while missing just five games. But Mayo was felled by season-ending injuries in each of the past two seasons, tearing a pectoral muscle in 2013 and tearing a patellar tendon in 2014. Both injuries occurred in the sixth game of the season. Although Mayo has started each of the past three games for the Patriots this year, he’s no longer a mainstay of the defense. Where he once never left the field, now he’s utilized sporadically and specifically, mainly on downs where the opponent is likely to run the football. Mayo has played 73 of 274 defensive snaps (26.6 percent) in the first four games. “Like everybody on the defense, everybody is ready to go week in and week out,” defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said Tuesday in a conference call. “Whatever we’re doing based on the game plan, guys are going to be on the field or off the field. We’re just trying to put everyone in the right position to make plays. “We’re fortunate to have guys that we can sub in week in and week out based on what we’re trying to do and (Mayo) is certainly an integral part of all of that.” Mayo, who took a pay cut in the offseason to remain with the Patriots, ranks 13th on the team in tackles with eight after leading the team in that category in each of his first five seasons. But this seven-time defensive captain is, not surprisingly, still setting an exemplary example off the field. “Jerod, from the first year he was here all the way up through, no matter what the situation is, comes into the building and just has the same steady attitude of working hard to get better and to try to improve himself every year,” Patricia said. “So, it's certainly a great thing for younger players to see and look at and understand how to be a professional football player and how to approach the game every week where the preparation really has to be consistent every week.” By Rich Garven", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:04:03.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
