The last time they started 0-3-0 was 2001-02. \nEven though this is a rebuilding season, they must start winning games to keep pace in the Eastern Conference or risk becoming irrelevant far too early. \n\"We have to try and get to that winning part of the process a little quicker for the purpose of keeping pace with teams and making sure we're not out of this and digging ourselves a hole,\" center Travis Zacac told NJ Advance Media. \"We were there with the work ethic last game and with competing, but now we need to put in some extra details and make sure we can finish one off.\" \nTheir morale may depend on it. \n\"I think it's important to win games. Obviously we're in the business of winning,\" defenseman John Moore said. \"There are no ifs, ands or buts about that. If anything, we're going to learn from the first two. It's not like we're just sweeping things under the rug.\"Our focus and our mindset coming in is to win every game. It does no one any good if you're just going to take moral victories and pat yourself on the back for being close.\" \nRELATED: Devils' injury update on John Moore, Patrik Elias \nSeveral players have said they want to get a win for rookie coach John Hynes sooner rather than later. But captain Andy Greene said the way they play is probably as important. \n\"Like I've said, it's going to be a long process,\" Greene cautioned. \"It's important for us to play the right way and win. Not just maybe play okay and get lucky and squeak out wins. If we play the right way, in the long run we're going to start winning more games than not.\" \nZajac said the team remains positive. \n\"We went into Washington and played a pretty good game. I thought we outplayed them for most of the game,\" Zajac said. \"They're a team that's supposed to do well. They brought in some pieces and are supposed to make a run. I thought we outworked them and outcompeted them. We gave them a couple power plays at the end that kind of killed our momentum. Other than that, we were there.\" \nHow does Hynes view the situation? Would he take a victory in which the Devils played poorly? \n\"It's always nice to be able to win, but you have to take the situations for what they are. Some of it is you want to be able to play well and continue to get better,\" Hynes explained. \"The more you do that, the more results will come. We have to continue to work towards a win. That's our objective.\" \nFor the record, the Devils made the playoffs after that poor start in 2001-02. \nRich Chere may be reached at rchere@njadvancemedia.com .
