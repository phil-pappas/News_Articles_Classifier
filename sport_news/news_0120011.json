By Mark Schnabel Newton Kansan The Newton High School boys' soccer team never could get into any sort of flow Thursday, falling to the Andover Trojans 4-0 Thursday in non-league play at Fischer Field. Josh Loflin scored two goals with an assist for Andover, 10-3-1. Enrique Trujillo added two goals. Tim Munson had three assists. The Railers were outshot 13-0. \"This team was in the final four last year, and they didn't lose much,\" Newton coach Scott Jantzi said. \"They are very organized. They put high pressure on us. They had speed and physicality. Just the one-two touches just spread us out. We need to do a much better job. We didn't have many shots on goal. When they played positional-wise, we didn't have a lot of time to think. We worked yesterday on finding the third person. We just didn't transfer that information over to the field. Andover found the back of the net three times in the first 28 minutes of play. The Railers did find their way forward a few times in the first half, but posed no threat. Newton was outshot 9-0 in the first half, 6-0 on goal, with Andover scoring on three of those shots. Andover put the game away with a breakaway goal in the 44th minute. The Trojans put in their JV players in the final seven minutes. Again, the Railers were able to mount attacks, but unable to finish them with shots. A couple of breakaway chances late in the game went well wide. Hervey Medina had four saves in goal for Newton. Michael Anaya kept the clean sheet in goal for Andover, not having to face a shot. Newton falls to 7-7 and plays at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at Maize. The Eagles are 12-2 and currently the top-ranked team in the district standings after a 2-1 win over Salina South Tuesday. \"We have two tough games next week with Maize and South,\" Jantzi said. \"They are the top two teams in the region. We went and saw them play Tuesday night. Both teams are very solid technically, speed-wise and tactically. They are able to defend well.\" JUNIOR VARSITY — The Newton junior varsity fell to Andover 2-0. Newton is 8-2-1 and plays at 5 p.m. Tuesday at Maize. Andover 2 2 —4 1.
