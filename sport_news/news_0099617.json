The Chiefs fell to 1-4. Jay Cutler's 7-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte with 18 seconds left won it. The Bears scored the final 15 points of the game after trailing 17-3. The Bears were playing without their top two wide receivers -- Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) and Eddie Royal (ankle) -- offensive linemen Jermon Bushrod (concussion) and Patrick Omameh (ankle) and safety Antrel Rolle (ankle). Although missing two of his best weapons, Jay Cutler's perfectly placed 22-yard touchdown pass to a double-covered Marquess Wilson in the back of the end zone brought the Bears to within 17-12 with 3:05 left, but the attempted 2-point conversion pass to Marc Mariani came up inches short. Robbie Gould's 30-yard field goal with 3:29 left in the third quarter had gotten the Bears to within 17-6 and made Gould the leading scorer in franchise history, surpassing Kevin Butler. It was Gould's 11th field goal of the season without a miss. With 9:57 left in the first half, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith flipped a short pass to wide receiver De'Anthony Thomas in the backfield and he outran the Bears' pursuit for a 19-yard TD reception and a 14-3 K.C. lead. It was just the Chiefs' second touchdown by a wide receiver since the start of the 2014 season. Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal late in the first quarter sliced the Chiefs lead to 7-3. Rookie center Hrioniss Grasu got off to a rough start in his first NFL game. In the first quarter he was bull-rushed by Chiefs nose tackle Jaye Howard, who sacked Cutler in the endzone and forced a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson for a K.C. touchdowns and a 7-0 lead. Bears linebacker Shea McClellin left with a knee injury in the third quarter and did not return. Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles left a short time later and did not return.
