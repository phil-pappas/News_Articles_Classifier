We are a diverse population, with many long-termers and hoards of newbies. We have experienced positive impact from the military presence, manufacturing, commerce, higher education, and tourism.\nThese have been fueled by our connectivity via interstate highways, rail, shipping, and air connections, as well as miles and miles of coastline and marshlands, an abundance of wildlife refuges, the wonderful array of parks, and wonderful examples of timeless architecture.\nI talk almost daily with people considering or planning moving here. Almost without fail the first question is “how is the crime?” and where are the safe areas to live and raise a family. Unfortunately I must answer that there is no guarantee that any particular area or address is safe, as bad guys have wheels, and often travel to where they believe the good stuff is available for the taking.\nWhile we can point to the overall decline of morals in our society, and attempt to throw blame on various contributing factors, the fact remains that today we have to deal with the crime that besets us and often threatens our very own personal well-being.\nWhat can we do about it, as individuals and as a community? Of course there is some help in being sure to secure your valuables at all times, utilize a security system, travel safely, and other things espoused such as becoming personally armed. It is not my intention to debate that subject here.\nI join the many who strongly believe that our best immediate line of defense is via law enforcement. I wonder if it is merely a matter of “joining the choir” or do our politicians really believe that crime is Savannah’s No. 1 issue. If they do, why are we paying our law enforcement officers so little that most have to moonlight? Why do we find it almost impossible to build our law enforcement team to a properly functioning level?\nI am sure there will be naysayers to what I am about to propose. Of course I am just one citizen and am not privy to all of the facts. However, I propose that we do the following immediately:\n1. Raise the compensation for our law enforcement personnel to a level at least 10 percent higher than any other municipality in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.\n2. Improve benefit packages to be superior to our “hiring” competition\n3. Increase our headcount (above our current desired level) at least twenty-five percent( in the next twelve months, 50 percent by the end of 2017.\n4. Modify the “Car to Home” program to make it effective upon hire, not after two years. Newbies get used cars and the veterans get the newest.\n5. Install a “tenure reward” program to help retain our best. Of course there should be properly administered proficiency measurement programs.\n6. Make our law enforcement training program the envy of the South and the nation.\n7. Consider, if we do not have one already, a supplemental force program such as recruiting active-duty military to be certified, equipped, scheduled, to serve alongside our own, if nothing else as drivers so the officer that would be the driver can now focus on full time observation.\nHow to pay for such is a good question. We have no problem talking of spending (or investing) $142 million in a new arena. I, for one, am very hesitant to attend any such events at an arena, for fear of crime.\nWhat do we need most? Is it a place to go hear Garth Brooks, or a safer place to live, work, and play.\nI urge our city leaders, elected or otherwise, to join together to seriously address our priorities, and make Savannah an even greater city. We do not have an unlimited supply of money, though many politicians act like we do. Let’s get real and do right for our citizens.\nOne closing thought: If we had a sufficiently sized police force, and made crime something not to be committed here, maybe more of the bad folks would migrate to where there are easier targets.\nWe do need to be about rehabilitation, for those that honesty seek it. Some of those that might otherwise head toward a life of crime, might just possibly become positively-contributing citizens that can live with less fear of becoming a victim, by any means.\nI am sorry if I have offended anyone. That was certainly not my goal.\nJOE DYER\nSavannah\nBen Carson would make a good president\nBernie Goldberg broadcast his opinions about Ben Carson on the O’Reilly Factor the other day. Goldberg said he did not think Carson was fit to be President because he demonstrated stupidity on three occasions in the last several months. Carson said that he considered homosexuality a choice because some men who go to prison straight come out gay. He said that the country shares some of the features of Nazi Germany and that Obamacare is as bad as slavery. And he said he would not favor a Muslim president. I do not believe Carson was stupid for making these comments. He may have been impolitic, brash, audacious, or injudicious, but he was not stupid, unless you think a politician is stupid for making a number of voters angry with him.\nI do not know how or when people acquire their sexual orientation, but I believe it may well be a life-style choice for some. So what? I think the fact that the federal government forces people to buy health insurance they do not want is tyranny. When the same federal government places some citizens’ lives in danger by having a presidentially appointed committee of bureaucrats decide what medical treatment is appropriate, that begins to make the tyranny very Nazi like. The Muslim faith is totally political in orientation. Anyone familiar with the tenets of the Quran knows that this faith is unlike any other religion and certainly one that is not congruent with American political values.\nI admire Ben Carson. I think he is honest and straight-forward. I agree with his emphasis on the values of hard work and self-reliance. I am very impressed with his life story and believe he is a perfect role model for all of us. I believe he could do a great deal to correct the division of black and white people in this country. I believe he has the perfect temperament to be president. I am cautiously confident, that he would have the good sense to discern the correct path for this country in economics and national security.\nI am hopeful that Ben Carson will become more attractive to the American people as the campaign progresses and would like to see him become a very fine president of the United States.\nSTEPHEN M HERMAN M.D.\nSavannah\nTybee Road, Daffin Park gazebo need work\nIn reference to Leonard Herb’s letter (“Stop treating Tybee Road like a ‘back road to nowhere,’ Oct. 2): Good luck, Leonard on getting the Tybee Road restored to its former beauty. I have written the Georgia Department of Transportation, talked with Chatham County and Tybee Island about it but no one seems to care.\nThe same goes with the gazebo in Daffin Park lake. It would be much more pleasant if it were not there. If it cannot be restored to something of beauty, not a closed up building with unattractive vines everywhere, how about having meetings to see what could be done? I would find it most rewarding to work on both projects. How about you?\nPAT DOYLE\nTybee Island", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-04T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:52:14.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
