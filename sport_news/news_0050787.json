File photo / Union Democrat. Tuolumne County’s agricultural industry saw a fifth consecutive year of growth in 2014, according to a newly released report, but farmers and ranchers are still dealing with challenges from the four-year drought and aftermath of the Rim Fire. The annual crop and livestock report, presented by Agricultural Commissioner Gary Stockel at the county Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday, stated the value of agricultural commodities produced in the county grew last year from $36.3 million to $44 million — a 21.3 percent increase over 2013. Stockel said the growth is largely attributed to higher prices for cattle because of fewer head being sold statewide due to the drought, as well as increased timber production from logging in the area burned by the 2013 Rim Fire. “Two major environmental events, the devastating Rim Fire in summer of 2013 and third year of drought, played significant roles in Tuolumne County production values and resulted in mainly positive impacts for 2014,” he said. “That might be counterintuitive, but it’s the laws of supply and demand.” The report stated livestock values were up about 36.7 percent last year over 2013 — from $17.4 million to $23.7 million — with the largest gain coming from a 70.8 increase in the total production value of cattle. Poultry also rose from $10.6 million in 2013 to $12.3 million last year, about 16.1 percent, thanks largely to increased turkey prices and production. Despite an 8.2 percent drop in prices, timber values jumped from $12.4 million to $13.1 million. The report attributed a 61.9 percent increase in the amount of board-feet harvested last year to “intense” logging on thousands of acres burned by the 402-square-mile Rim Fire. The overall value of field crops was up about 10.2 percent from $4 million to $4.5 million, though fruits and vegetables were down about 30 percent due to drought-related declines in grape yields. District 1 Supervisor Sherri Brennan, chairwoman of the county Natural Resources Committee, said cattle prices remained strong for the past couple of years because national inventories have been down primarily as a result of recent droughts in Texas and Oklahoma. However, the report didn’t take into account production costs or net returns to growers and ranchers. Rangeland forage production was down 64 percent, while the value of rangeland rose 12 percent. Rising prices for feed due to short supply and thousands of acres of summer rangeland destroyed by the Rim Fire have also driven up costs. “There’s a lot of competition for forage, hay prices have been really high and ranchers have been feeding a lot more hay than they would if you had normal rainfall,” said Brennan, a Sonora rancher. “It almost feels like you’re just a pass-through, because your costs are just much higher right now.” Brennan added that many ranchers in the area have been downsizing their herds in response to the drought, and it takes three years to produce a calf. Nathan Rosasco, a third-generation rancher in the Montezuma area, said he knows some ranchers who have dropped their numbers by 20 to 25 percent in response to the drought and Rim Fire. “The Rim Fire hit some of them because they weren’t able to take as many cattle in after the fire,” he said. “I’m an irrigated pasture here, so what affected me was the winter, because it didn’t produce as much food and I didn’t have as much water.” A boon in Central Valley almond production has also reduced the availability of grazing land for local ranchers, Rosasco added. Agriculture is the No. 2 industry in Tuolumne County behind tourism.
