There are few words to describe the devastation to families, communities and, once again, our sense of safety caused by such an act of violence. So refusing to say the shooter's name to strip him of the celebrity he might have envisioned feels like a tiny victory in an ocean of loss.\nBut Hanlin's insistence that he and his office will not utter the name of the shooter, identified by others as Chris Harper-Mercer, amounts to little more than grandstanding at a time that demands professional leadership. Selecting which facts to share is no way to build confidence in an investigation or to foster true debate – both of which are critical in any effort to stop what has become nauseatingly routine.\nThe investigation, led by Hanlin's office, has only just begun. In press conferences, Hanlin has been urging anyone who might have tips relating to the shootings to call 1-800-CALL-FBI. But as a practical matter, how are people who may have valuable information about Harper-Mercer supposed to call if they never know that he was the shooter?\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

There is no doubt a mess of factors that contributed to Harper-Mercer's murderous rampage and they deserve investigation to guide any public policy debates that emerge. Did mental illness play a part ? How did he get his weapons? These are relevant, uncomfortable questions that, in Hanlin's mind, may glorify the act, but in truth they only expose the complexity of the problems we face. Ignorance never makes us stronger. It only makes it easier to resort to tired rhetoric and the same failed proposals that ensure nothing ever changes.\nHanlin's willingness to withhold public information in this instance also raises the question of what else he would keep confidential because it conflicts with his views. Hanlin, in 2013, authored a letter to Vice President Joe Biden , in which he pledged not to enforce any gun-control laws that he saw as unconstitutional. While Hanlin certainly wasn't alone in his objections, the episode shows his willingness to let personal beliefs affect how he does his job.\nCredibility and professionalism matter in such a high-stakes case as this. Like the murders of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, some people are already posting videos questioning the legitimacy of the shootings at Umpqua Community College. Hanlin's selective information-sharing does not help that.\nIt is especially in these times of crisis, where, fear, anger and uncertainty are running high, that we need and expect our leaders to guide us. That comes through being transparent with information and showing professional judgment, not personal bias.\n— The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCBaZXFxA5M", "http://koin.com/2015/10/01/video-douglas-county-sheriff-talks-about-umpqua-cc-shooting/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaeeqD_IpXk"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:51:03.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
