Most recently, he had been with the Los Angeles Angels, where he’d worked as the assistant general manager. It is at that organization where he worked closely with Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto, who used to be the general manager of the Angels. \n“Through the course of the 20-plus years I’ve known Scott, I’ve come to see him as one of the most complete, well balanced and inclusive baseball people in the industry,” Dipoto said in a statement (via the Seattle Times ). “I’ve been fortunate enough to call him a teammate as a player, while also having worked closely with him as an organizational leader in both Colorado and Los Angeles. He is a communicator with strong baseball acumen and leadership skills. I truly believe his strong character and career experiences as a player, coach and executive have prepared him for this opportunity.” \nServais’s job will now be to clinch a postseason berth for the Mariners for the first time since 2001. \n“I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to manage the Seattle Mariners,” Servais said (via the Times). “It has long been my goal to manage a big league team and while I took a slightly different path than many, I am confident in my ability to lead. We have a terrific core of players and I’m looking forward to bringing in a coaching staff that will help me establish a winning culture here as we work toward putting a championship-caliber team on the field for the fans of the Northwest.” \nPrior to becoming a front office executive and now a manager, Servais spent 11 seasons as an MLB catcher with the Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs, San Fransisco Giants and other teams.
