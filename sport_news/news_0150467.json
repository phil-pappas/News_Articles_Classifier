Buffalo Bills fans are famously loud, and their team was 2-1 entering Sunday’s game, swaggering with an exciting quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, and the bully of a defense Rex Ryan said he’d build when he became head coach in January.\nBut as the game kicked off, a lone Giants fan sitting among the Bills faithful in the upper deck didn’t worry.\n“We’re due for a Rex Ryan Special,” said 37-year-old Matt Charchan.\nA Rex Ryan Special is a perfectly winnable game that Ryan’s squad blows because of a deluge of penalties and curious decisions, and a Rex Ryan Special is what went down in suburban Buffalo Sunday.\nThe Giants upset the Bills, 24-10, with their best defensive showing of the season and with help from Buffalo’s 17 penalties and befuddling third-down play calling, the kind of performance that marred Ryan’s chaotic six-season tenure with the New York Jets that ended with his firing last year.\nDespite the ominous off-season that sidelined defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul and left tackle Will Beatty—and despite yet another clock-management blunder in the fourth quarter’s final minutes—the Giants are 2-2. Astonishingly, this puts them in position to take control of the chaotic NFC East division because of injuries and mismanagement in Dallas, Philadelphia and Washington.\n“I don’t know if we’ve climbed out of the hole, but I know right now the Giants are relevant,” running back Andre Williams said.\nEven on a cloudy, football-perfect autumn afternoon, Ralph Wilson Stadium is tough on visiting teams. Fans holler at opposing offenses on all four downs as if it were a college game. “It’s not like the Meadowlands,” said Charchan, who works in executive recruiting in Manhattan. “There’s not that enthusiasm on first and second down.”\nThe Bills fans hollered throughout the first quarter, as Giants took a 9-3 lead after quarterback Eli Manning found Dwayne Harris, the kick returner who has become the team’s No. 3 receiver, for a 21-yard touchdown pass. But when the Giants upped the advantage to 16-3 after Manning hit Rueben Randle for an 11-yard score, the crowd got restless.\nENLARGE The view from Ralph Wilson Stadium.

But on third down on the ensuing drive, the Bills blitzed and Manning got the ball quickly to running back Rashad Jennings, who dodged three defenders as he raced down the left sideline for a 51-yard touchdown.\nWith the Giants ahead 24-10, they could have clinched the game if not for another befuddling fourth-quarter decision.\nWith four minutes left and the ball at the Buffalo 8, Manning threw twice. The first was incomplete to Odell Beckham Jr. in the end zone. The second was intercepted by Buffalo’s Stephon Gilmore and returned to the Giants’ 30-yard line.\n“Those Giants a——s,” shouted Bills fan Kristin Fyda. “Don’t be greedy!”\nThis time, the decision to throw instead of run didn’t cost the Giants.\nWith the help of a chop-block penalty that negated Taylor’s 32-yard touchdown pass, the Bills turned the ball over on downs, letting the Giants kneel to escape Buffalo with the upset victory.\n“But did you see how hard the Giants were trying to give it away?” Charchan said. “Why were they passing?”\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP549_1004gi_P_20151004195106.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP549_1004gi_M_20151004195106.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:22:35.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
