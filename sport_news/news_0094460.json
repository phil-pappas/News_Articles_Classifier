White took notice, and though it was a one-sided performance, the UFC boss indicated it wasn’t quite what he wanted. \n“To tell you the truth, to be honest, I think that Bader had an opportunity when Rashad looked old and slow tonight, and Bader had the opportunity to put the pressure on him and try to finish him,” White said. “Rashad hasn’t fought in a while, Rashad’s had a couple knee surgeries and I don’t know. We’ll see what happens.” \nBader would likely be up next for a title shot if not for Jon Jones (21-1 MMA, 15-1 UFC), the Ithaca resident and graduate on Union-Endicott High School. The ex-champ’s return looms over the title after he was stripped of the gold in April following his involvement in a hit-and-run accident . \nJones has not competed since he defeated Cormier at UFC 182 in January, but he recently came to a plea agreement that resulted in 18 months of probation and a number of charity and youth work appearances. \n“Bones” posted a response to Cormier’s victory immediately following UFC 192. He hinted a return to the octagon could take place in the near future. \nDespite the post, however, White would not shed much light on a Jones comeback and said decisions regarding the future of the light heavyweight belt will be made in the coming weeks. \n“Jon has some obligations to handle with his personal situation, and we’ll see how this goes,” White said. “Like I said, I don’t know how this is going to play out. We’ll see what happens next.” 2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1Lc6ep3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:53:42.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
