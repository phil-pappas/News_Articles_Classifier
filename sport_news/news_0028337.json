Tom and I are committed to the values that are fundamental to the success of Cardinal athletics.\" \nAlso Thursday, CBSSports.com reported that an Ohio State freshman told NCAA investigators that his recruiting trip to Louisville included paid escorts. \nJaQuan Lyle reportedly spoke to the NCAA investigator this week about his June 2013 trip to Louisville. A woman has alleged in a new book that she \"took four escorts, at the request of former Louisville staff member Andre McGee, to do a 'show' for a 'new recruit named JaQuan Lyle.'\" \nRead the story here. \nPitino has said he has no knowledge of McGee's alleged activities. \nAfter the allegations became public last Friday, U of L announced it was conducting an internal investigation led by Chuck Smrt of the Compliance Group, a Kansas-based firm. \nRamsey's statement requested patience. \n\"The investigation of the allegations may take time and we must, as one university, continue doing the work we do to move our university and our community forward.\" \nPrevious Herald-Leader coverage:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:52:16.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
