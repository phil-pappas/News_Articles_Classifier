There's no hatred there. Gareth is a quiet guy. They're complete opposites. But I think Gareth can learn a little bit from Ronaldo as well, interacting maybe a little bit. But he wants his own life and he lives it. Gareth is a great footballer, he doesn't want anything more. He has some very good endorsements but his whole life is to be the best footballer in the world.\" \nOn Bale's new position and his status at Real Madrid, Barnett assures that the player is climbing the ladder in football's new world order: \"I think there's a great love of Ronaldo. I think that the new guard is coming and there's some resentment, perhaps, to that. But I think things will change. Gareth's now playing in a better position, where he wants to play. I've always said it, I think he'll be the best player in the world in the next couple of years.\" \nHe also had a message for Carlo Ancelotti, who he got into a war of words with after claiming that Bale's teammates were not passing him the ball: \"I had an analysis made and it was true.
