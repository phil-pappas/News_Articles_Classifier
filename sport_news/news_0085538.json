THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck \nRyan Nugent-Hopkins and Benoit Pouliot scored for the Oilers, who finished with an impressive 6-1-1 pre-season record.\nRyan Miller made 25 saves for the win as Cam Talbot kicked out 24-of-27 shots in defeat.\nIt was the second straight exhibition game between the teams, with the Canucks defeating the Oilers 5-2 on Thursday in Edmonton.\nVancouver opened up the scoring four minutes into the game off a 3-on-2 rush. Sven Baertschi sent a beautiful cross-ice pass to Horvat for a tip in. It was Horvat's fourth goal of the pre-season. Baertschi's assist was his fifth â€” all of which have come against Edmonton.\nMiller was forced to look sharp early in the second with the Oilers' top line buzzing in the Canucks zone. He made a big stop on a backhanded shot from Pouliot off a breakaway. Edmonton outshot the Canucks 14-7 in the period.\nPouliot had multiple chances in the second and was finally rewarded early in the third. Nugent-Hopkins wheeled past Canucks blue-line prospect Ben Hutton to set up Pouliot for the tying goal.\nNugent-Hopkins scored what looked like the go-ahead goal with just over two minutes left on a 2-on-1 with Teddy Purcell , but Vancouver tied it 2-2 seconds later when Hansen banged home a loose puck in the crease.\nVancouver opens the regular season on Wednesday at the Calgary Flames. Edmonton kicks off its campaign against the Blues in St. Louis on Thursday.\nNotes: The Oilers placed veteran defenceman Nikita Nikitin on waivers Saturday. Nikitin, who is set to make $4.5M this season, had 10 points and a -12 rating in 42 games last year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:16:07.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
