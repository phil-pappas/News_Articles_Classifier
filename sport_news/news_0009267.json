It starts with great defense,\" South Dakota coach Joe Glenn said. \nThe Coyotes held the Bears to just 155 total yards, while rolling up 529. \n\"We're pretty happy with the way the guys played up front,\" Glenn said. \"You've got to feel good about putting 529 yards on somebody.\" \nKicker Miles Bergner, whose last-second field goal lifted the Coyotes to a stunning win over North Dakota State last weekend, kicked three field goals in the first quarter to give USD a 9-0 lead. He added one more in the second half to tie the school record of four in a game. \n\"Happy day for Miles Bergner. He did a good job for us,\" Glenn said. \nThe Coyotes (4-2, 2-2 Missouri Valley) took the opening kickoff and moved into field goal range where Bergner kicked a career-long 53-yarder for a 3-0 Coyotes lead. He later kicked field goals of 29, 28 and 36 yards. \nMissouri State (1-6, 0-4) erased most of the early lead when Deion Holliman returned a kickoff 100 yards to make it 9-7 with 1:40 left in the first quarter. \nThe Bears' only other threat ended at the USD 4, following a 60-yard run by Jason Randall. Marcelo Bonani kicked a 21-yard field goal. \nRandall ran 10 times for 77 yards. \nDefensively, USD held Missouri State to just 49 yards in the first half. The Bears' longest drive in the first two quarters was 13 yards. \nMichael Fredrick and Nate Gunn filled in for injured starter Trevor Bouma. Fredrick ran for 129 yards and a score and Gunn added 46 yards and a TD. \nRyan Saeger completed 20 of 29 passes for 275 yards, including a 34-yard TD to Eric Shufford. \nBrandt Van Roekel caught seven passes for 86 yards. \nThe Coyotes took control in a 17-point third quarter. \n\"We've got some wind in our sails and bounce in our step,\" Glenn said. \"I knew we could play better.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:24:28.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
