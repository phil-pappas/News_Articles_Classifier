Red Sox president Dave Dombrowski says the team looks forward to having him back. \nFarrell was diagnosed with cancer in August and missed the last six weeks of the season. Bench coach Torey Lovullo took over for him temporarily. The Red Sox went 28-20 under Lovullo but couldn’t avoid their third last-place finish in four seasons. \nOf course, the other year was the 2013 World Series championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:43:20.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
