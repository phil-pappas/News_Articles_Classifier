It's not fair to them. They don't even know how to get hold of this guy.\"\nThe seven-member school board is elected from separate subdistricts within the district. Turay represents Subdistrict 5, which includes Crete and some unincorporated areas nearby. Edward J. Anderson Jr., the school board member who appears to be living in Florida, represents the neighboring Subdistrict 7, which includes a portion of Crete and unincorporated areas as well.\nKadner: Let's get started on Illinois' Wall of Shame Phil Kadner Until a couple of weeks ago, the Illinois Legislature was ready to vote on spending $500,000 of your tax money on a statue for former U.S. Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, now under federal indictment for spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of his money to allegedly silence someone who...\nUntil a couple of weeks ago, the Illinois Legislature was ready to vote on spending $500,000 of your tax money on a statue for former U.S. Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, now under federal indictment for spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of his money to allegedly silence someone who...\n(Phil Kadner) The issue of where Anderson is living was raised by Crete resident Tammy Burnham at a recent school board meeting. Burnham contends that Anderson lives in Jacksonville, Fla., and filed articles of incorporation Sept. 1 for something called the World Overcomes Worship Center. The filing in Florida lists Anderson as the corporation's registered agent, with a Jacksonville apartment address.\nAnderson's house on Royal Ridge Drive in Crete has been in foreclosure since June, according to Will County Circuit Court records. Burnham said neighbors told her that when the Andersons moved out, they said they had no plans to return.\nShe noted at the school board meeting that Anderson had not attended a regular board meeting since June 16, and she asked District 201U officials to explain how he could be living in Jacksonville and still claim he's a resident of Subdistrict 7. Anderson's last board committee meeting was July 14, according to the board's records.\nAfter voicing her concerns, also claiming that Anderson has failed to respond to numerous emails and phone calls, Burnham asked district administrators what steps could be taken to remove him from office. She also asked for a date when Anderson planned to return to Illinois.\nLawsuit: Crete-Monee student beaten despite telling dean about bullying Alicia Fabbre A 16-year-old and his mother are suing Crete-Monee School District 201U over a beating the teen suffered in 2014, according to the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit, filed earlier this month in Will County Court, claims the teen suffered a head injury and a broken leg after another student attacked him.

The...\n(Alicia Fabbre) In an email response, Monica Spence, District 201U's assistant superintendent of student affairs, wrote that Illinois law requires a person to establish residency by demonstrating a \"physical presence and an intent to remain. Once a residence is established, the legal test no longer requires a physical presence but, rather, focuses on whether the individual has intent to 'abandon' his residence.\n\"In reviewing cases of abandonment under Illinois law, being absent from the state or even having a residence in another state does not make an individual a non-resident even if his absence is for a period of years. Instead, the Court will focus on the 'intent' of the individual and will look to determine if there have been any formal actions by the individual to permanently disclaim residency in Crete.\n\"In this case,\" Spence continued, \"the only information that we are aware of is a statement that Mr. Anderson has temporary relocated to Jacksonville, Florida to perform missionary work associated with his church, but that he intends to return to Crete at the conclusion of his missionary work.\n\"The documentation that was provided by Mrs. Burnham does not appear (sic) that there was an 'abandonment' of his residency. The fact that he has a new temporary residence in Florida standing alone is insufficient to demonstrate abandonment.\"\nLincoln-Way School District to form audit committee including residents Susan DeMar Lafferty In a further effort at financial transparency, Lincoln-Way High School District 210 will create an audit committee consisting of residents and school board members to provide an extra set of eyes on its finances.\nDuring Thursday night's school board meeting, board President Kevin Molloy named board...\nIn a further effort at financial transparency, Lincoln-Way High School District 210 will create an audit committee consisting of residents and school board members to provide an extra set of eyes on its finances.\nDuring Thursday night's school board meeting, board President Kevin Molloy named board...\n(Susan DeMar Lafferty) Spence did not create that response without consulting the school district's attorney, Bill Gleason. The Daily Southtown obtained a copy of a communication from Gleason to the school board that contains almost exactly the same information as provided by Spence.\nI talked to Gleason on the telephone, and he reminded me of a lawsuit arising out of a residency controversy during Rahm Emanuel's first Chicago mayoral campaign. Emanuel had been living in Washington, D.C., for years, serving as President Obama's chief of staff, and the contention was that he failed to meet a one-year residency requirement in Illinois to run for mayor.\nEmanuel contended that although he leased his Chicago house while in Washington, his wife's wedding dress remained in the basement, proving his intent to return. Emanuel also noted that he had retained title to the house, while renting it to a fellow who refused to move when Emanuel wanted to return to Chicago.\nGleason said Emanuel had also voted in Chicago through the years, maintaining his voter registration there, also proving his intent to return to Chicago.\n\"If you could show that Anderson had registered to vote in Florida, you might have a case that he no longer intended to return to Illinois,\" Gleason said.\nBut without that sort of proof, he said the District 201U board is powerless to remove him from office, even if he has missed numerous meetings, he said.\nAfter speaking with Gleason, I spoke with Burton Odelson, the Evergreen Park attorney who filed the lawsuit challenging Emanuel's residency and a longtime municipal and election law attorney. Odelson said he represented the Proviso Township School Board many years ago when it successfully removed a board member from office due to a residency issue.\n\"So the school board does have the authority to do that if you can prove the person has changed his place of residence, and in that case we had photographs and other documentation,\" Odelson said.\nHe said he believed the Will County state's attorney, if requested to do so by Crete residents or District 201U officials, could launch something called a \"quo warranto\" process — requiring Anderson to show by what authority or right he continues to hold office.\nAs for the residency issue, if Anderson and his wife have moved to Florida, Odelson said, that could be cited as intent to abandon his residence in Crete, especially if it were combined with a home foreclosure involving a large amount of debt. However, he said that if Anderson had not bought a home in Florida and was doing missionary work, Anderson could have a legal argument to remain on the school board.\n\"But why would this guy want to continue serving as a school board member if he has moved to Florida?\" Odelson wondered. \"That's basically a volunteer position.\"\nTuray's answer is that the board is split 3-3 politically on some controversial spending issues, including the expansion of a school that's costing millions of dollars. If Anderson is replaced, Turay said, the board majority fears that it will lose a vote requiring a referendum on the spending issue and lose battles over other issues that have divided the district.\n\"My thought right now is to call a special meeting of the school board, ask the regional school superintendent to attend and try to figure out a way to remove him from office if he's going to be living down in Florida,\" Turay said.\nGleason said the regional school superintendent does have limited authority to remove school board members under Illinois law.\nWhatever happens here, the notion that an elected official could leave the state for an extended period of time (years), refuse to resign and remain in office defies common sense.\nAnderson should appear at the next District 201U board meeting to explain himself and either resign or be removed from office.\npkadner@tribpub.com\nCopyright © 2015, Daily Southtown Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56259fcc/turbine/ct-sta-kadner-crete-school-board-st-1020-20151019-thumbnail", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5618788b/turbine/ct-sta-lway-210-audit-st-1011-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-556b529e/turbine/ct-sta-kadner-shame-st-0531-20150529", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615be34/turbine/ct-sta-crete-schools-lawsuit-st-1008-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:09:03.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
