The hardest thing is that there is a small window after racing the third semifinal to racing in the final, I came off the bike, sat down and went back out and I just had nothing left, I tried my hardest but I just couldn't pull anything together \" he said. \nGlaetzer has a strong record against Dawkins. \n\"He is a fast man and it is hard to keep up sometimes, he loves this track and he seems to ride really well here. He is fast, he has beaten me both times we have been at the Oceanias here,\" Dawkins said.
