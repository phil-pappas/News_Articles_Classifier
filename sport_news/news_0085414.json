It was the Pioneers’ 16th loss in as many games against the Cardinals. The Pioneers were not lacking for offense, but their defense couldn’t get the Cardinals off the field. Fisher threw for 256 yards and ran for 202 more. The Cardinals played with a lead the entire game and were able to find an answer every time the Pioneers got close. UC relied heavily on the arm of Teddy VanGalen on Saturday. He threw for 335 yards and a touchdown, but the Pioneers only netted 57 yards on the ground and averaged less than 2 yards per carry. Utica cut the lead to five points with less than a minute to play. Jerred Beniquez capped an 83-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown scamper, but the Pioneers couldn’t recover the onside kickoff, and the Cardinals were able to run out the clock. UC (3-2, 4-3) hosts Buffalo State at 2 p.m. next Saturday at Charles A. Gaetano Stadium. Cortland State topped Alfred 20-14 Saturday, and with three games to go in the season, the Red Dragons hold a one-game advantage and the head-to-head tie-breaker over the Pioneers in the conference standings. Bowdoin 30, Hamilton 20 Another close loss for Hamilton College. The Continentals trailed 15-0 at halftime, but cut the deficit to 15-13 after three quarters. The Polar Bears finished strong, though, and handed Hamilton its 23rd consecutive loss. The Hamilton quarterbacks were under fire most of the afternoon. Chase Rosenberg was intercepted twice, Cole Freeman was picked off once, and the Bowdoin defense sacked the Continentals QBs six times. Freeman threw for 262 yards and a touchdown, and Charles Ensley caught eight passes for 139 yards and a score. LaShawn Ware was Hamilton’s leading rusher with 77 yards on 16 carries. Hamilton (0-4) hosts Colby at noon next Saturday. Colgate 17, Georgetown 13 James Holland ran for two touchdowns and Colgate held on to beat Georgetown. Holland finished with 75 yards rushing on 14 carries. Jake Melville was 11 of 23 for 190 yards passing, and ran for 80 yards on 14 carries for Colgate (2-0, 3-4). Holland scored from the 8 and 2, and Jonah Bowman kicked a 39-yard field goal to put the Raiders up 17-0 at halftime. Henry Darmstadter kicked two 37-yard field goals, and Kyle Nolan ran for a 10-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter for Georgetown (1-1, 3-4). Nolan was 21 of 38 for 194 yards passing. Jo’el Kimpela ran for 104 yards on 22 carries for the Hoyas. After Darmstadter made his second field goal with four minutes to play, Holland ran for 26 yards on four carries as part of a nine-play drive to help the Raiders run out the clock. Page 2 of 2 - Colgate is off next week. The Raiders return to the field Saturday, Oct. 31, when they host Fordham. Morrisville State 31, Hartwick 28 Morrisville State pulled its record back to .500 on the season with a three-point win over Empire 8 foe Hartwick. Cory Benedetto was below 50 percent passing on the day, but he threw for 225 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. The Mustangs also collected nearly 200 yards on the ground, most of which came courtesy of Christian Pena (23 carries, 115 yards and a touchdown). Hartwick had a chance to win the game in the closing seconds, but Morrisville’s Shane Carroll intercepted John Garcia at the Mustangs’ 4-yard line, and Morrisville was able to take a knee to run out the clock and seal the win. Morrisville hosts Ithaca at 1 p.m. next Saturday.
