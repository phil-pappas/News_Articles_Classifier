But he found a way to win, and that is the biggest compliment you can give a starting pitcher is when they don’t have their best stuff, they figure out a way to give you seven innings of two-run ball. That, like I said, is a tremendous compliment.”\nAs long as people are handing out compliments, here’s Chicago manager Joe Maddon.\n“His command tightened up a bit,” Maddon said. “I thought early on … a lot of pitches were high. I don’t think he knew where the ball was going through it, and all of a sudden he found out where it was going and that’s what happened. … I saw him get better command of his fastball down in the zone. There’s like really good late carry on the fastball from the side, I thought. He’s just got a better game in progress to his credit.”\n“He started making pitches,” Terry Collins said. “He didn’t have very good stuff early. His command has been off. I don’t know if it’s fatigue this time of year. Again, he’s pitched more than he ever has in his whole life, so that could be the answer.”\n  chicago cubs ,  david wright ,  jacob degrom ,  joe maddon ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:01:39.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
