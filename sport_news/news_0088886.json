At least for the first 40 minutes.\nThe Flyers returned to the ice Tuesday night for a game for the first time since shutting out the defending Stanley Cup champions last Wednesday. And they were sluggish early, in almost a predictable fashion.\nThey started slow, looked out of sorts on their usually sound power play early in the game, and didn't have much jump early, never catching up in a 2-1 loss to the visiting Dallas Stars.\n\"It took us some time to find our energy,\" coach Dave Hakstol said. \"You can use whatever term you want, the speed of the game, whatever term you want to put on it. We had our moments. We had our spurts. But they also had some sustained pushes in the first and second period, until we got going a little bit more in the third.\"\nMore coverage Box score: Stars 2, Flyers 1 VOTE: Will the Flyers make the playoffs?

Are there some things that come with that? Yeah, maybe a little bit. But we just couldn't find our legs early on in the first half of this game.\"\nGoaltender Steve Mason returned to action for the first time after being away from the team tending to a personal family issue. He kept the Flyers stable in the first period, but was the victim of a bouncing puck late in the opening 20 minutes that kept the Flyers from surviving the period scoreless.\nThe puck jumped over the stick of Flyers defenseman Brandon Manning and landed right on the stick of top-line center Tyler Seguin, who didn't get much on his shot but enough to get by Mason with only 51.8 seconds left in the first period. The goal snapped the Flyers' home scoreless streak - the longest in their history to start a season at home - at 139:08.\nThe Stars, now winners in four straight, added to their lead only 11 seconds into the second period, when the reigning Art Ross Trophy winner - awarded to the player who leads the NHL in scoring - Jamie Benn skated in on a two-on-one and buried a quick snap shot past Mason, who made 30 saves on 32 shots.\nManning and his defensive partner, Michael Del Zotto, were on the ice for both goals against the Stars' top unit.\n\"They're three good players,\" Manning said. \"We were ready for that, but they get a few bounces and you don't make strong plays, that's what happens.\"\nOf the 12 goals the Flyers have given up this season, five have come less than a minute and a half into the start of a period.\nThat 63-second stretch was enough of a cushion for goalie Antti Niemi, as the Flyers came on late. Niemi, who beat the Flyers in the 2010 Cup Final as a member of the Chicago Blackhawks, stopped 34 of 35 Flyers shots, most of which came from close range. His best work came during a Flyers power play in the second period.\nThe Flyers finally solved Niemi in the third period. Wayne Simmonds took the puck wide and sent a wrist shot toward the goal. Center Sean Couturier crashed the net hard, and the puck bounced off his body and by Niemi. It was reviewed and confirmed as a goal.\nBut Niemi stood tall for the final 11:03. He helped kill a Flyers power play that began with 6:11 to play in the game with back-to-back saves on chances from Simmonds and Michael Raffl with just over five minutes to go.\n\"I thought we did a good job staying in it,\" Simmonds said. \"We kept getting shots, kept getting opportunities, and we came up one short tonight.\n\"He did a good job, Niemi played a good game. I thought we had second opportunities, sometimes third opportunities and he was stopping the puck. He was seeing things well tonight.\"\nThe Flyers won the total shots-on-goal battle, 35-32 (15-6 in the third period), but had 13 giveaways to Dallas' seven for the game.\nThe Flyers have only eight goals in their first five games, an average of only 1.6.\nMatt Read was called for a slashing penalty with 2:08 left in the third period to foil the Flyers' late charge. The home crowd spent a large portion of that minor penalty booing the Flyers' lack of aggression on their penalty kill.\nLuckily for the Flyers, those boos won't have to resonate for five days. There's no break between games this time, as they'll meet the Bruins in Boston Wednesday night.\nSlap shots Michal Neuvirth , who posted back-to-back shutouts in Steve Mason's absence last week, likely will get the start in Boston . . . R.J. Umberger was a healthy scratch, along with Vincent Lecavalier and Luke Schenn . Umberger missed the Flyers' two games last week with an undisclosed upper-body injury, but is fully healthy . . . The Flyers-Bruins game will start at 8 p.m. and will be exclusively on the NBC Sports Network as part of the station's \"Rivalry Night.\"", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/nhl/boxscore.asp?gamecode=2015102015&home=15&vis=9", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNHL_Philadelphia_Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:41:46.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
