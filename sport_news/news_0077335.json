And it wasn't just the large number of alumni from the state military college making their home in the Greenville area. \nUndefeated in the Southern Conference, the Bulldogs (5-2, 4-0) dedicated their 38-17 win to their strength and conditioning coach, Donnell Boucher, who lost two family members in a fatal house fire in Massachusetts. \nThen there were the dozens of freshmen cadets, called Knobs, who made the trip from Charleston to show their support for their team. They were among the loudest voices in a reported attendance of 12,124 on Saturday. \nThe Citadel's second-year coach, Mike Houston, said the maturity of sophomore quarterback Dominique Allen had a lot to do with the win. \n\"We saw four or five different defensive schemes from Furman,'' Houston said. \"They were throwing everything at us. It gave us the opportunity for a lot of big plays.'' \nSaid Allen, who had two rushing touchdowns, \"We're family. We band together. We come through.'' \nWith back-to-back wins over conference foes Wofford and Samford -- convincing wins by three touchdowns or more -- and with the 21-point gap opened up on the Paladins, The Citadel's coaching staff hopes the program has turned an important corner. \nHouston noted, \"Everybody was on the same page, and we were able to adjust on the fly.'' \nFurman had its chances, taking the initial lead, then closing the gap to seven points, 24-17, with 4:03 left in the third quarter. \"I was wondering in the middle of the third quarter if we could win the ballgame,'' the coach said. \nThe Citadel shut down the Paladins the rest of the way. \nFurman's comeback attempt tested his team, Houston said. Many squads would have engaged in finger-pointing and bickering, he said, but that didn't happen. \n\"Our guys played their positions, stuck with each other and found a way to respond,'' said Houston. \nAllen came into the game leading the SoCon in rushing TDs and tied for seventh in the FCS with eight. His two quarterback-keeper touchdowns of 1-yard apiece against Furman gave The Citadel big boosts just when they were needed most. \n\"We're going to face adversity every week,'' the quarterback said. \"It makes a difference when you can respond.'' \nAllen said the team was thankful for the strong vocal support from the Knobs, who don't usually travel as a group to away games, according to Houston. \n\"They were as loud as they are at home. For them to give up their Saturday to come up here, I couldn't be any more grateful,'' said Allen. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1MZWRdh TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:12:56.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
