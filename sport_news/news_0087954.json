The Rapid City Journal reports Mayor Steve Allender formed the committee to figure out what to do next with the aging facility, which needs $73 million in upgrades to meet Americans with Disabilities Act standards and other non-compliance issues. The committee has met twice already. Residents in March voted against the project, which would have replaced the facility's 9,400-seat arena with one that could seat up to 19,000 people. Expansion supporters considered it a wiser investment than upgrading the existing facility, while opponents questioned the cost of what would have been the costliest project in city history.
