After a slow start and a goal allowed in the 30th minute, Fort Lewis exploded on the Cougars (1-14-1, 1-10-1 Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference) by scoring four times in the next 60 minutes to comeback and win the match 4-1. Fort Lewis (11-3-2, 6-1-1 RMAC) dominated the match with 27 shots to only 11 by Colorado Christian. Seventeen of the Skyhawks’ shots were on frame. Elliot Chadderton only needed to make five saves to secure the victory. Tamino Kroeger found freshman Nicolas Perez to tie the match just ten minutes after the Skyhawks surrendered the opening goal. After that, the flood gates opened. Perez set up fellow freshman Martin Lopez on a breakaway shortly before halftime and Lopez beat the keeper to give the Skyhawks a 2-1 lead heading into halftime. In the second half, it was all Fort Lewis. Zac Lawrence’s fifth goal of his senior season gave Fort Lewis a 3-1 lead and Tamino Kroeger capped off the scoring shortly after with his sixth goal of the campaign. Next up for the Skyhawks is a 3 p.m. match Friday at Dirks Field against Metropolitan State University of Denver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:35:15.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
