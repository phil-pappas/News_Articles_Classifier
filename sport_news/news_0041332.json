Tavares and Lee also had an assist and Mikhail Grabovski added two as the Isles won their second straight and improved to 2-0-1 in its new Brooklyn home.\n\"You’ve got to find ways to win,\" Tavares said. \"You won’t always have your best. We were able to beat one of the best teams in the West. You look at their team. It was a good way to battle back and find a way to win.\n\"Our crowd has been great. Fans have been great. They have brought energy and passion.\"\nAustin Watson, Filip Forsberg and James Neal scored for the Predators, who lost for the first time after opening the season 3-0-0.

[I] tried to beat my guy up the ice [and] I just tried to make [Rinne] hesitate a little bit. There’s not a lot of room on the net to shoot at, and I was able to get it past him.\"\nKulemin stuffed a rebound of a shot by Brock Nelson past Rinne to put the Islanders up 3-2 at 6:42 of the third.\nPANTHERS 3, SABRES 2 (at Sunrise, Fla.) — Jaromir Jagr had two first-period goals and an assist in the third period to lift Florida.\nJagr, 43, stayed hot with his third and fourth goals of the season and continues to climb the all-time scoring list.\nPENGUINS 2, SENATORS 0 (at Pittsburgh) — Evgeni Malkin scored his first goal in nearly seven months and Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 22 shots for his 39th career shutout as Pittsburgh won for the first time this season.\nCAPITALS 4, BLACKHAWKS 1 (at Washington) — Braden Holtby stopped 26 shots, Alex Ovechkin scored a goal in his return to the Washington lineup following a one-game disciplinary absence, and the Capitals beat Chicago.\nSTARS 5, LIGHTNING 3 (at Tampa, Fla.) — Jason Spezza scored a momentum-shifting goal in the third period and had an assist as Dallas beat Tampa Bay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:26.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
