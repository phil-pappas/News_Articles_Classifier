(Harvey Fialkov) \n\"For sure, he's a dangerous player.\" \nThe 6-foot-2, 201-pound Eichel, who has been favorably compared to fellow American center Mike Modano — the No. 1 pick in 1988 who scored 561 goals in 21 seasons — has two goals in three games, including the game winner in Buffalo's victory Monday against the Columbus Blue Jackets. \nA day later, Panthers rookie Connor Brickley potted his first NHL goal, also a game-winner, in Florida's 4-1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes. Brickley, 22, the 50th overall draft pick in 2010, and Eichel were born four years and 26 miles apart in Malden and Chelmsford, Mass., respectively. \nFor the past few summers Eichel and Brickley have trained together in a facility in Foxboro, and on Wednesday nights went against each other in a summer league filled with professional and Division I players. \n\"You could just tell from our practices and our games in the pro league that his speed and hands are unreal,\" Brickley said. \"His shots are really hard. He's sick.\" \nEichel will be on a line with left wing Evander Kane and right wing Brian Gionta, who is making his season debut against the Thursday after missing the first three games with a lower-body injury. \n\"I'm still adapting my game and trying to get better,\" Eichel said. \"As a team we're trying to build chemistry and that's how we'll move forward.\" \nThis and that \nPanthers coach Gerard Gallant will go with the same lineup as in Tuesday's 4-1 win over the Hurricanes, except for Roberto Luongo returning to the net instead of Al Montoya . \nSo Quinton Howden will play his second straight game on the fourth line in place of Shawn Thornton , and the six defenseman remain the same, with Steve Kampfer and Dylan Olsen continuing to sit out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:06:34.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
