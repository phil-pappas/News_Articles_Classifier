Schmidt finished the scoring off on a 8-yard pass to Ethan Moyer in the fourth quarter. \nWhere the Eagles struggled was holding onto the ball, with four turnovers keeping them from firing on all cylinders. \n“We did what we needed to do. We weren’t real smooth,” Schmidt said. “We’d been doing a pretty good job with turnovers, but that hurt us offensively. Defense, I think was pretty stout for the most part.” \nOlpe improved to 4-2 on the season and 2-0 in district play. The Eagles host a tough test in Lyndon next Friday. \n“They’re a good team. They do a lot of things really well,” Schmidt said. “It’ll be a good ballgame.” \nOlpe 14 7 13 6 — 40 \nOswego 0 0 0 6 — 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:08:00.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
