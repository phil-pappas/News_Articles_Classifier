Experts say that number should have been closer to 80 to 90 percent.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive completed its analysis by comparing a database of asbestos-removal projects from the Department of Environmental Quality and a database of demolition permits from Portland's Bureau of Development Services.\nToday, we are providing the public with access to the raw data we used. Click here for the demolition permit data -- stripped of personal information such as email addresses -- and here for the asbestos-removal project data . We also used metro property tax data, which you can find here. For our graphic, we grouped demolitions by neighborhood. You can download that data here .\nYou can read about how The Oregonian/OregonLive used the data for its analysis here.\nAlthough public records laws require agencies to hand over data as promptly as they can reasonably do so , agencies have leeway in how long they take to fulfill requests.\nThe city's development bureau delivered the initial data in eight days and an expanded data set in 54. The state, meanwhile, took more than three months.\nOn April 20, The Oregonian/OregonLive requested copies of the department's databases for asbestos-removal projects and licensed asbestos contractors. The department said it would take 20 hours of work to produce the records at a cost of $600.\nPublic records law doesn't require agencies to answer questions about their records. Sometimes, though, high cost estimates are the result of a misunderstanding between the agency and the person asking for records. Agencies often put reporters directly in touch with data experts to ensure both are on the same page.\nIn this case, the department didn't explain why copying a database would take 20 hours or allow a reporter to speak with a department data expert.\nWe decided to narrow our request. On May 15, we asked for data reflecting the location, type and date of asbestos-removal projects in the state 2010 to 2014.\nWhen the agency responded a month later, June 23, the data was incomplete.\nWe compared the records DEQ gave us with records the agency provided to a neighborhood activist one month before and found we were missing hundreds of records.\nThe department attributed the mistake to a technical error and fixed it after another month, on July 23. The agency delivered us 17,917 electronic records.\nIt took 95 days to get the data, from the day The Oregonian/OregonLive filed its original request with the department, and 70 days from the day we filed the revised request.\nEven then, there was one last problem. We had asked for all removal projects, but the department omitted records of projects involving less than 80 square or 40 linear feet of asbestos-containing materials.\nWe filed a further request, for paper records of these small projects. While awaiting an answer, we tried to estimate how big an issue such small projects posed. Twelve industry experts told us the missing records were not a major factor, amounting to 0 to 12 percent of projects.\nWe used this factor to conservatively adjust downward our estimate of homes demolished with asbestos inside.\nThe Department of Environmental Quality did not return repeated calls and emails asking for comment about how it handled our records request.\n-- Fedor Zarkhin\nfzarkhin@oregonian.com\n503-294-7674; @fedorzarkhin", "external_links": ["http://rlisdiscovery.oregonmetro.gov/", "http://www.doj.state.or.us/pdf/public_records_and_meetings_manual.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:48:19.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
