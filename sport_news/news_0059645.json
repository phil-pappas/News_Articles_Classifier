Smith, the Ravens' leading receiver, suffered his back injury against the Steelers and has sat out since. \nSeveral top players, including running back Justin Forsett (ankle), outside linebacker Elvis Dumervil (groin) and cornerback Lardarius Webb (thigh), sat out with injuries suffered in Sundayâ€™s 33-30, overtime loss to the Cleveland Browns. \nRunning back Lorenzo Taliaferro (foot) missed the game Sunday and continued to sit out Wednesday, while rookie wide receiver Darren Waller (concussion) was also absent Wednesday. \nGuard Marshal Yanda also sat out after being limited in one practice last week with an ankle injury, while wide receiver Chris Givens and safety Terrence Brooks sat out for unspecified reasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:07:17.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
