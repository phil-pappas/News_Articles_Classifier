As always, feel free to fire away anytime via email (see below), Twitter or Facebook.\n@JordanRaanan any update on Beatty?\n— IG:takedapicturemike (@WestsideCorna) October 2, 2015\nHe's progressing well following surgery for a torn pectoral muscle on May 20. The original timeframe was five months. That would have taken him until mid-October. Everything I've been hearing is he has a chance for the Cowboys game in Week 7. It makes sense. That would be five months and five days post-surgery.\n@JordanRaanan percent chance Welker gets on the roster?\n— Money Makin X (@Xalence) October 2, 2015\nIf Welker was as \"healthy\" and quick as coach Tom Coughlin indicated, why would the Giants hesitate with wide receiver Victor Cruz out at least a few more weeks? Something tells me they're not quite as sold as they made it seem. For that reason, I'm putting it at 20 percent. If the Giants' third receivers Dwayne Harris and Geremy Davis get shut out again Sunday in Buffalo and the desperation to find someone that can help at that spot rises, so will Welker's chances of landing in New Jersey.\n@JordanRaanan who plays first? Pierre-Paul or Cruz?\n— Mike King (@MikeKing00) October 3, 2015\nAs I've noted since the beginning, the concern with Cruz has never really been, will he return. It's at what level of effectiveness he'll be able to play at when he returns. The problem right now remains Cruz's calf, and calf injuries are not career-ending.\nPierre-Paul, meanwhile, wants to return . Whether the Giants are willing to pass him on his physical is another story. They appear headed to some sort of battle on that issue. For that reason, I'm going with Cruz as my favorite to get on the field in a Giants uniform this season first, unless he suffers yet another setback.\n@JordanRaanan Giants have the look of an 8 win team. What do you think is biggest key to make them a playoff contender?\n— Dan (@dcbru10) October 3, 2015\nThe Giants need some kind of pass rush or their defense is going to be a serious problem moving forward. It's unlikely they continue to force turnovers at the current rate. Right now they have just 3.0 sacks in three games. That's not good enough. They need that to improve in order to keep the defense serviceable and propel them into a true playoff contender.\n@JordanRaanan Has JT Thomas officially lost his starting job?\n— Diego Rodriguez (@DA_GO1222) October 3, 2015\nThomas has started all three games. He played 14 snaps against the Redskins. His role is as the Giants weakside linebacker in their base defense. The problem is they don't use their base defense all that often and Jonathan Casillas has surpassed him as the second linebacker in the Giants' nickel package. That will greatly limit the amount we see Thomas this season, unless there is an injury.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/WestsideCorna/status/649756000556224512", "https://twitter.com/JordanRaanan", "https://twitter.com/dcbru10/status/650314973449723904", "https://twitter.com/JordanRaanan/", "https://twitter.com/Xalence/status/649755678756741120", "https://twitter.com/DA_GO1222/status/650336847147757568", "http://www.facebook.com/JordanRaanan", "https://twitter.com/MikeKing00/status/650307643907551232"], "published": "2015-10-03T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:51:08.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
