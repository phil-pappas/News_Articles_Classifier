The ball was put where only Ertz could get it.\nWorst throw: Unlike past weeks, Bradford didn't have many egregious throws, but his first-quarter interception from his own 21-yard line was slightly behind wide receiver Jordan Matthews.\nAnalysis: Bradford converted an early third-and-six with 12:44 to go in the first quarter, stepping up into the pocket to find Ertz over the middle, but it was called back due to a false start. On the following play, Bradford was sacked, killing the team's opening drive.\nBradford's second drive of the first quarter got off to a bad start when a pass to receiver Jordan Matthews went off his hands and was intercepted at the Eagles' 21-yard line. The pass was slightly behind Matthews, but still should have been caught.\nOn fourth-and-one with 11:47 to go in the second quarter, Bradford rolled out to his right, looking to pass the ball, but had to run when nobody was open. Bradford dived for the first down, going between two defenders for the conversion. It was the kind of play that could earn Bradford respect among his new teammates.\nThe drive was killed when Matthews dropped a pass on third-and-nine with 10:14 to go in the second quarter.\nBradford did a nice job stepping up into the pocket throughout the game, and it was on display with 7:17 to go in the second quarter, as he stepped up and found tight end Zach Ertz for a first down and a 10-yard game on third-and-six.\nBradford had a chance to get the Eagles in the end zone with less than 10 seconds to go in the second quarter, but his throw to tight end Zach Ertz was knocked away in the end zone. The argument could be made that the ball might have been thrown a little low, and could have been lofted, but it was a nice play by Panthers cornerback Josh Norman to knock it away.\nBradford finished the first half 13 of 25 for 103 yards and one interception.\nThe drops continued to haunt Bradford in the third quarter. With 5:51 to go in the quarter, Bradford put the ball on a rope to wide receiver Josh Huff in the back of the end zone from the seven yards out, but Huff dropped the ball.\nStarting with the ball on his own 10-yard line at the end of the third quarter, Bradford led the Eagles' offense down the field, hitting Ertz for a 24-yard completion to get the team near midfield. The drive ended in a field goal that cut the deficit to 21-16, with 11:58 to go in the fourth quarter.\nBradford wasn't able to get anything going for the Eagles' offense on the next drive, throwing the ball low and incomplete on third-and-15 with 7:08 to go in the game.\nThe Eagles quarterback had one more shot when he got the ball with 3:18 to go in the fourth quarter on the Eagle's 11-yard line. The Eagles seemed ready to punt on third-and-16, but a terrible Bradford pass was bailed out by a Panthers penalty, giving the Eagles a fresh set of downs.\nOn 3rd-and-nine, with just over two minutes to go, Bradford hit Ertz in stride and heading toward a first down, but the ball was dropped. Then, on fourth down, Bradford hit receiver Miles Austin in the hands past the first down marker, but the ball was dropped -- again.\nOverall, Bradford looked better than he has all season, with his lone interception not really his fault. For the first time all season, Bradford outplayed his teammates, which is an encouraging sign -- at least for the quarterback -- even in a loss.\nNow the Eagles' receivers just have to help him out.\nGrade: B-", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:50:38.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
