(AP Photo/Rod Aydelotte) Posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 3:00 am Sills went from scout team QB to starting WR   \nWhen West Virginia junior quarterback Skyler Howard found No. 15 along the sidelines for a beautiful 29-yard catch down to the Baylor 6-yard line on the second play of the second quarter Saturday, the FOX television announcers struggled with their description. \nGus Johnson and Joel Klatt praised both the throw and the catch, which set the Mountaineers up for a score on the very next play, cutting the No. 2 Bears’ advantage to 17-14, but they were in no hurry to make any identification as they frantically searched their depth charts. \nAfter finding no luck on the wide receiver depth chart, they turned to the roster, where they found two No. 15s, redshirt-freshman kicker Billy Kinney and true freshman quarterback David Sills. They eventually settled on Sills, who was, in fact, the recipient of the throw, joking about how WVU head coach Dana Holgorsen had assured them in the pregame meeting that nobody not on the depth chart would be making an impact. \nThat certainly wasn’t the case. Howard again found Sills early in the second half when the two, who have spent countless hours in the quarterback meeting room together, hooked up again. This time it was a 35-yard touchdown strike that made the score 34-24 midway through the third quarter. \nSills was targeted a couple other times but ended the day with those two catches for 64 yards. He was the Mountaineers’ second-leading receiver on the day, behind only Shelton Gibson. \nSo exactly how did a quarterback in high school, who came to WVU to play quarterback and had been on the scout team as a redshirt through the first five games of the year, suddenly end up becoming a weapon catching the ball instead of throwing it. \n“I watched him in scout team become probably the best receiver on our team,” said Holgorsen, explaining that he had to play him there on the scout team just to have enough bodies, with so many young receivers actually playing a role in the two-deep. \n“He turned some people’s heads down there, so I took him last week and had a talk with him. We practiced and he looked pretty good. I asked him if he wanted to go play ball, and he said that he wants to do anything he can to help the team. We put him out there at wideout. If I didn’t think he could compete, I wouldn’t have put him out there.” \nAnd it appears as though Sills could make an impact at one of his team’s biggest positions of need. He displayed good hands, plenty of speed and a solid awareness in his Mountaineer debut, and Holgorsen said he did enough to earn more playing time. In a new depth chart released Monday, he was listed as the starter at the Z-receiver position, ahead of freshman Jovon Durante. \n“He looked good,” said Holgorsen. “So we will probably keep doing it.” \nThat doesn’t mean Sills’ days as a quarterback are over. The 6-foot-3, 198-pounder from Wilmington, Del., completed 202 of 318 passes for 2,688 yards and 27 touchdowns in 2013 and was the No. 14 pro-style quarterback on Rivals’ list coming out of Eastern Christian Academy last season, despite playing in only three games in 2014 before breaking his ankle. \n“This kid was groomed to be a quarterback,” said Holgorsen. “He has played quarterback his whole life. He signed here to play quarterback, and he played quarterback all last spring. \n“I wouldn’t shut the door on quarterback in the future. He’s a really good football player.” \nFor the rest of this year, though, the action that Sills sees — and it’s likely to be plenty, considering the coaching staff made the decision to burn his redshirt halfway through the season — will likely be as a receiver. \n“He hasn’t taken enough reps at quarterback,” said Holgorsen. “He has been there on scout team. (Redshirt freshman quarterback) William Crest has been taking reps. (Freshman quarterback) Chris Chugunov has been taking reps. Those guys would have the best chance to go in there and run the offense based on the reps that we have been giving them. It would be tough to put a guy in at quarterback that hasn’t taken any reps since August. \n“My plan with David moving forward is to do what you have to do to help the team win, and then we will reassess it in January. We will see who is on campus and who we need to rep.” \nIf Saturday’s debut is any indication, Holgorsen and crew could be left with only one choice. \n— Email: chuffman@register-  @CamHuffmanRH  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:02:28.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
