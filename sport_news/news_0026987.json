He loves practice as much or more than anyone in the league. Rather, Utah’s schedule didn’t allow for a practice session between a Monday workout in Hawaii and Sunday’s session at the Zions Bank Basketball Center.\n“There’s a lot of things we can get out of it (the Hawaii trip),” Snyder said, “but practice time wasn’t one of them.”\nThe Jazz, who are back in action Monday night at home against Portland, didn’t fully make up for lost practice time on Sunday, but almost.\nUtah began at 10 a.m. and didn’t call it a day until about 1:15 p.m.\n“It was kind of a long practice,” Jazz small forward Gordon Hayward said with a grin. “A lot of mental preparation.”\nThe marathon practice, reminiscent of several extended grueling practices last season, included film study, walk-throughs, individual workouts and a team session.\n“We looked at everything, honestly,” Hayward said. “It’s things that we did right. Things we didn’t do right. Basic stuff.\"\nSnyder is catering this year’s training camp and preseason workouts around the unusual beginning to the training camp, which included just three days of practice before a long travel day and the Hawaii trip.\n“A lot of teams are nearing the end of training camp,” he said. “We’re almost in a second training camp. Some of it hopefully won’t be redundant.”\nSnyder said the structure of this year’s camp makes it especially hard for younger players and new guys to pick up the Jazz system before they’re thrown into game action.\n“You saw that against Phoenix,” he explained. “Guys that were in the game, there were breakdowns we saw last year a lot.”\nWhile the Jazz remain encouraged by how they played against the Lakers in two wins in Honolulu, they hope to learn from Friday’s less-than-stellar performance in the 101-85 loss to the Suns.\n“I thought we played really well in Hawaii. I thought we played really hard. I thought our energy was good,” Hayward said. “We just kind of stagnated in Phoenix, fatigued mentally and physically, and we just weren’t as good. We weren’t as sharp. We let them punk us a little bit there.”\nHayward pointed out that Utah’s 10-turnover third quarter was particularly alarming. Phoenix outscored the Jazz 35-21 in that period to take control of the exhibition contest.\n“At times we looked good and then times we turned it over 10 times in one quarter and didn’t look very good. It’s just about being sharp, being forceful, precise with our movements and getting everybody to do it consistently,” Hayward said.\n“We’ve got a young team. Other teams are going to throw stuff at you that maybe we aren’t prepared for. We’ve got to stick to our habits and take care of the ball.”\nUtah is averaging 20 turnovers a game this preseason. Hayward said the Jazz offense has counters in place to help give options when opponents take things away from them — such as perimeter passes — but it’s a matter of being on the same page with teammates.\n“It’s just all reads. It’s all just being mentally sharp, mentally focused and that’s everybody,” Hayward said. “If you have one person who forgets what they need to do, it messes up the whole flow of the offense. We’ve all got to be sharp. When a team tries to deny you, take things away, you’ve just got to go to your counter.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:46:47.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
