Kevin Noonan Special to The Morning Call Can Eagles contain Carolina's Cam Newton? \nThey've been the Philadelphia Eagles' Big Three for almost three years now, and in that time no position group on the team has been together longer or played together better. \nFletcher Cox, Bennie Logan and Cedric Thornton are the rocks upon which the Eagles have built their defense, and they were rock-solid in Sunday's 27-7 victory over the New York Giants that lifted the Eagles into first place in NFC East. That defense made life miserable for Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who was intercepted twice, sacked twice and was flagged for two intentional grounding penalties as the Eagles' pass rush engulfed him. The Eagles' defense also held the Giants' running backs to just 69 yards on 22 carries. \n\"The defense as a whole played well, and the guys up front played great,'' Eagles linebacker Connor Barwin said. \"They set the tone for the rest of us and when they play like they did last week — actually, like they have all season — then we can be a very good defense.'' \nCox said the continuity along the D-line has been a key to its success. Since Logan was moved into the starting lineup in Week 8 of his rookie season in 2013, the three down linemen have played together in 28 out of 30 games, with the only gap coming this season when Thornton missed two games with a broken hand. \nCoach Chip Kelly said that consistency up front has made life easier for defensive coordinator Bill Davis because it allows him to focus on and be creative with other areas of the defense. Davis knows the D-line is in good hands ... and it's invaluable for a coach to have a group he can depend on every week. \n\"I think the one thing that Billy has benefited is that continuity we have up front because you've had the same D-Line with both those outside linebackers [Barwin and Brandon Graham] ... '' Kelly said. \"So, I think what Billy is really benefiting from is that that whole group has a good continuity, and as the back end gets together with more experience, I really see that group coming together.'' \nThey had their best game of the season against the Giants, who scored on their first possession of the game, but didn't score again. \n\"After that [opening TD], you have to give credit to them, they did a good job,\" Manning said. \"They started getting some pressure, and we didn't run the ball quite as well, and they got us off the field on third down. Their defensive line is a talented group.'' \nAnd the Eagles were able to pressure Manning with just four rushers, and that left the defensive backs and other linebackers free to focus on coverage. That had the domino effect of making Manning hold the ball longer as he waited for a receiver to get open, and that gave the Eagles' pass rush more time to get to Manning. \n\"When you can get a four-man rush, it's a great thing to have from a secondary's standpoint,'' Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said, \"because all you have to do is cover for a few seconds and the next thing you know, [the quarterback] is getting uncomfortable and getting hit.'' \nHowever, that job will be much more difficult this week, because the Eagles will face a quarterback who's built like a tight end and runs like a running back. Carolina's Cam Newton is having his best season and it's not a coincidence that the Panthers are 5-0, one of five undefeated teams in the NFL. \nThe Eagles didn't have to worry about keeping Manning in the pocket, but they can't allow Newton to run around and make the ad-lib plays for which there is no defense. Of course, that's easier said than done — Newton is averaging 10 runs and 45 yards per game. \n\"He's such a playmaker, you have to plan on keeping him in [the pocket],'' Davis said. \"But the athleticism kicks in and it's about a bunch of effort trying to get him and taking good angles. He's going to make his plays. Athletes like that make their plays, and we have to keep it to a minimum.'' \nLogan said he doesn't care how strong and elusive Newton can be — his job is the same no matter who the quarterback is. \n\"You still have to attack the pocket and get pressure on the quarterback and make him uncomfortable and make him throw the ball before he wants to,'' Logan said. \"We just have to make sure we don't give him any way to escape. So, we have to be disciplined, but we still have to be aggressive, because that's who we are.'' \nNotes: Thursday's injury report was identical to Wednesday's: Not practicing were WR Nelson Agholor (ankle), WR Riley Cooper (knee) and LB DeMeco Ryans (hamstring). Agholor said that he has a high ankle sprain, which means he probably won't play until after the bye. … Ryans said he did some light workouts on Thursday and hopes to play on Sunday night, but won't know for sure until he practices the next couple of days. … Agholor will probably be a scratch, and if Cooper can't play the receiving corps will be Jordan Matthews, Josh Huff, Miles Austin and Seyi Ajirotut. … Limited in practice on Thursday were LB Kiko Alonso (knee) and DE Brandon Bair (groin), while Huff (knee) and LB Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) participated fully.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:50:32.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
