And the junior has a very good chance. \n\"She’s having a really great season and she’s worked hard starting in the summer,\" Passaic Tech coach Charlie Weinpel said. \"She’s more hungry this year than in the past, is running with more intensity, and is mentally tougher.\" \nShannon has had success in the past, finishing eighth in the county as a freshman and third last year behind winner Meghan Jozefczyk of Clifton, with times around 20:45 at the Garret Mountain course. \nBut this year, she’s set personal bests three times at the county and state sectional course. And she produced the fastest time ever by a Passaic Tech runner at Darlington, where she ran 19:44 in the Season Opener Invitational. \nShe’s lowered her Garret best to 20:14, a PCT record and the fastest race by a Passaic County runner this year. \nBut Shannon’s win is far from a foregone conclusion. Wayne Hills junior Taylor Domico, who won the Big North Independence meet, and Patriot senior Katerina Zachmann, who was Wayne Hills’ No. 1 most of the season, also can prevail. \nThen there’s Jozefczyk, the junior defending champ, who is slowly recovering from an injury that ended her sophomore year soon after she won the title a year ago. \nWayne Hills is the prohibitive favorite to win its third team title in four years. It has a shot to break the county record of 21 points, set by the Patriots when they won in 2012. \nEmily Becker, Shea Brennan and Natalie Zawistowska all can finish in the top 10, as can Passaic Tech’s Meralis Mendez, Lakeland’s Linnea Gilligan and Clifton’s Mollie Slanina. \nLook for PCT and Clifton to battle for second, with West Milford fourth and Lakeland, Passaic, Wayne Valley and Eastern Christian all in contention for the final spot. \nOn the boys side, the individual title seems to be between Wayne Hills senior George Galkin – second to county champ Rishi Jashnani last year – and Kennedy freshman Jaron Jordan, who hopes to be the first ninth-grader to win a boys county title. \nGalkin has the year’s fastest time at Garret for a Passaic County runner – 16:43 – but Jordan has broken 16:55 three times this year. Jordan ran about 10 seconds faster a week ago, when the two won separate divisional titles in the Big North meet. \nGalkin and Jordan seem to be comfortably ahead of a group of about 10 runners, including Passaic Tech’s Alejandro Ibarguen, Tarin Nelson and Jason Rodriguez; Wayne Hills’ Joe Zisa, Eric Solorzano and James Brennan; Passaic’s Carlos Perez; Lakeland’s Andy Biss; and Clifton’s Kevin Heredia. \nWayne Hills should win its second straight boys title and third in five years. It could be the first time the Patriots win both team titles in the same year, and the first time any team has swept since Clifton did it in 2008. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:59:25.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
