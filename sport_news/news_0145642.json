Players and coaches in our organization understand that. We want to distinguish ourselves with our play, not with what we say. We want to define ourselves with what we do, not by what we do.\n“Greg understands that now. That’s how we want to proceed going forward.”\nUSA TODAY\nBrennan: Greg Hardy remains unapologetic, yet will be cheered on Sunday\nHardy, who is returning from a four-game suspension for violating the league’s personal conduct policy, said he hopes he comes out “guns blazing” when the Cowboys host the New England Patriots on Sunday.\nA two-month NFL probe concluded that Hardy used physical force against his ex-girlfriend “in at least four instances” during the altercation on May 13, 2014, including one “which caused her to land on a futon that was covered with at least four semi-automatic rifles.”\nAmong other controversial comments, Hardy also said Brady is “cool as crap. Have you seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game, I hope her sister comes to the game, all her friends come to the game.”\nGarrett said Hardy was “very receptive, very respectful, appreciated my comments. Hopefully he will handle it the right way going forward.\"\nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell\n106 CONNECT 58 TWEET LINKEDIN 23 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1Rw5GLu", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799044500232111-newhardy.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1Rw5GLu", "http://usat.ly/1RvNmlO", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/nfl/2015/10/08/73575014/", "http://twitter.com/EricPrisbell", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4542759004001_4542729493001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4542759004001_4542729493001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4542759004001_4542729493001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/christinebrennan/2015/10/07/brennan-hardy-cowboys/73503702/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rw5GLu&text=Jason%20Garrett%20scolds%20Greg%20Hardy%3A%20Not%20how%20we%20operate%20as%20an%20organization&via=enquirer", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799044500232111-newhardy.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rw5GLu&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7af597ed30dc66fedee4bdffd7868d65ec34f027/c=0-48-680-728/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798038963156695-newhardy.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e55d7c467ecf6bc5dbae74643821c93670fe6b59/c=0-57-680-964&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799044500232111-newhardy.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4542759005001_4542729493001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:46:49.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
