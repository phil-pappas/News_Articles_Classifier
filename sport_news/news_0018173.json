The Grizzlies will make the trip to Skip Pope Stadium led by Kyle Wilkie, the senior quarterback who can run the ball and has twice shown the capability to pass for more than 400 yards in a single game. Staff photo by Katherine Frye slideshow Although Creekview has won six of the seven games in its annual rivalry with Sequoyah, the games have been close, with only one being decided by more than 10 points.Another close game may be in store tonight, with both teams looking to solidify their position near the top of Region 7 (A).In addition to the half-game that separates the teams, Sequoyah coach James Teter said the game takes on even more importance because of the results against common opponents.“With both of us losing to Dalton, it gives Dalton a leg up,” Teter said. “Unless they somehow stumble here in the last couple of weeks, they’ll probably get first, we’re fighting with Creekview for second and third. Where you finish there matches you up with the other side, so both of us would like to finish as high as we can.”Region 7 follows a format in which the two subregion leaders play one another for the championship Nov. 6. From there, the No. 2 seed of each subregion will play the No. 3 of the other side, with the winners also clinching state playoff berths.Creekview and Sequoyah entered their meeting in a similar situation last season, with the Grizzlies winning 31-28 on their home field. Both teams took momentum from the game, with neither losing again until the state playoffs.For Creekview, the game will again rest on the arm of quarterback Kyle Wilkie. The senior has thrown for more than 300 yards in three of his last four games, breaking the 400-yard barrier twice.“As always, we’re going to have to rely on our quarterback to make some plays,” Creekview coach Terry Crowder said. “He’s been playing well lately, and so have our receivers. They’re really getting into a nice rhythm out there, so I imagine we’ll throw it some.”Catching Wilkie’s passes will be receivers Trevor Kolb, Andy Davis and Brian Davis. All three have totaled more than 35 receptions and 200 yards this season.Sequoyah’s focus on defense will be on stopping Wilkie. While Teter said it may be impossible to completely stop the Grizzlies’ offense, he does have a plan to slow it down.“It’s just a matter of keeping your coverage the whole time,” he said. “(Wilkie) seems to be at his best when he scrambles around and makes things happen. We have to try to contain him and keep him in the pocket.”If the Chiefs take away the pass, Creekview will have to rely on Wilkie and freshman Cade Radam to move the ball on the ground, something Crowder said he is comfortable with.“I like our running game,” he said. “We’re going to do what we need to do to move the ball. If they’re loading up to stop the pass, I think we’ll have the numbers in the box to run the ball successfully.”On offense, Sequoyah had its most complete game of the season last week. Quarterback Austin Tracy put up big numbers, as did receiver Derrion Rakestraw and the running back trio of Cameron Gales, Luke Jensen and Trey Mitchell, but Teter said the biggest difference was in the trenches.“I’ve seen the most improvement in our basic fundamentals and what we do,” he said. “I think kids are starting to understand our offense and how it works a little bit better. Our line has improved the last couple of weeks. They’ve gotten a lot better, and that’s probably been the biggest thing that’s helped us.”That newfound success will be tested tonight when the Chiefs take on a Creekview defense led by senior linebackers in Dylan Carl, Addison Prater and Kevin Jones.“Rakestraw is obviously the first weapon you have to take away,” Crowder said, “but they can run it, too. They have a couple good running backs, so we’ll have to play good assignment football and tackle well to win.”Regardless of which team wins tonight, both showed last year that they can bounce back from early losses to make the playoffs.“I think we can make the playoffs again,” Teter said. “It’s a different bunch, but I think they have it in them. It’s just a matter of winning some games. Hopefully, that will continue, but I think this team has it in them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:20:53.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
