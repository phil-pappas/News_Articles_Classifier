That of the freedom of expression,\" added Bartomeu. \n\"They have sanctioned Barca for allowing, or not impeding, a number of members from expressing their feelings in a peaceful manner with a symbol, the Catalan flag for independence, that doesn't promote violence, that is not banned in any place and that represents a legitimate feeling of identification for many Barcelona fans and Catalans.\" \nThe club also emphasised their stance by placing a banner in the middle of the Camp Nou pitch before kick-off against Eibar yesterday with slogans campaigning for the right to free speech. \nBarca have long been targeted as a symbol for those that want to see the rich north-eastern region of Catalonia break away from the rest of Spain. \nHowever, before recent regional elections in which pro-secession parties won the majority of the 135 seats in the Catalan parliament, Bartomeu insisted the club would remain neutral in the debate. – AFP, October 26, 2015. \nShare with others", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:42:03.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
