Giving this team a very human feeling. \"If you look at everything else, we were right there. They just beat us by that field goal. Everyone knows we can beat teams but we have to play the best that we can to continue doing what we are doing\" said James Monroe senior Connor Boothe. \nThe Mavericks now has to regroup and refocus for Liberty, and with a lot on the line, that won't be a issue. \"I said to one of them the other day, when would you rather lose now or in the playoffs? Hoepfully they are looking at it that way. I think they are, I think they are focused\" said James Monroe head coach John Mustain. \nLiberty is coming off a late win over Independence last Friday, giving them some much needed momentum after some early disappointment. \"Well, we left a couple on the table, but all in all not bad\" said Liberty head coach Jeff Alexander. \nNow its time for the Raiders to zone in on James Monroe, and find a way to defeat their explosive attack. \"I don't think you can stop them, we have to slow them down. Not turn the ball over for us and execute plays\" said Alexander. \nThis game means a lot for both teams as the season comes to an end, and they know a win in this one could do big things for their future. \"Solid football team. We are going to have to play our \"A\" game. That's what we are looking forward to\" said Alexander. \"Especially this late in the season, if we get another win it will be huge. This is the time that matters, this time of year\" said Boothe.
