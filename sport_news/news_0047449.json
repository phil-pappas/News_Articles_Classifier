When the troops challenged the persons approaching the fence, they started firing which was suitably retaliated by our jawans. However, the smugglers managed to escape taking advantage of darkness,” said officiating DIG, BSF, Amritsar sector, IP Bhatia.\n“We fired around 38 rounds, besides some illumination rounds to see the smugglers during the five-hour-long operation,” said Bhatia.\nSources said the BSF personnel first observed the movement of Pakistani smugglers near the international border around 10.30 pm last night.\nThis is the fifth such incident in the Amritsar sector in the past 10 days.
