So far, he’s not showing any sign of jet lag. \n“I played nicely again today and had a decent second day,” the Englishman said. “I’m feeling a bit tired but playing good and I’m right there in the mix. It’s nice to be in this position.” \nIndia’s Anirban Lahiri was at 6-under after a second 67 left him tied fifth with 2009 US PGA Champion Yang Yong-eun (66), British Masters winner Matthew Fitzpatrick (67), Australian Nathan Holman (66) and England’s Matt Ford (65). \nDustin Johnson was the biggest name to miss the cut after a 72, which put him one stroke above cut level of even par. \n“I played terribly. I didn’t drive it good and didn’t hit my irons good. I didn’t do anything good really,” the American world No. 8 said. \nAlso missing the cut were former major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland (72), defending champion Scott Hend of Australia (74) and Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez (73). Jimenez was chasing a fifth Hong Kong title.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:58:09.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
