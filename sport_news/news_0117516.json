Big penalty.\" \nMourinho felt Chelsea had been denied a spot-kick for a second successive Champions League away game, following the loss at Porto in the last round. \n\"The referee and the (additional) goal referee decide not to give (it),\" Mourinho added. \n\"Against Porto it was a clear handball, last minute, a decision crucial for the result of the game. \n\"It was not last minute but it was a clear penalty. I don't know. The referee didn't see it? The referee decided not to give it?\" \nMourinho felt Skomina had a good game otherwise and pointed to the example of Craig Joubert's mistake in Scotland's last-gasp Rugby World Cup quarter-final loss to Australia, which World Rugby later ruled was an error. \n\"I think the referee was very good. I'm serious,\" Mourinho added. \n\"I think he made one mistake and, for example, in the Rugby World Cup, I think the referee in the Scotland game was very good, but he made one mistake and because of that mistake Scotland is crying.\" \nIt was a vastly improved display, even on the win over Aston Villa, but Chelsea stayed third in Champions League Group G behind Porto and Dynamo, who remained unbeaten. \nMourinho had targeted four points from the double header with Dynamo - the Stamford Bridge return is on November 4 - and was content with a point after losing at Porto last time out. \nYet Chelsea came close to returning from NSK Olimpiyskyi with more as Eden Hazard and Willian hit the woodwork. \n\"For 70, 75 minutes, we had the control, the initiative, the chances,\" Mourinho added. \n\"We hit the post, we had the penalty. We had everything, but we didn't score. \n\"The game in the second half is a little bit of a trap, because we want to win, we feel we can win. But at the same time we cannot lose. \n\"If we lose this game we have to win at home and then we are just at the limit. \n\"The result is acceptable because it keeps us in a strong position.\" \nHazard was restored to the starting XI, but Mourinho declined to appraise individual performances, merely commenting on the collective, with confidence apparently restored ahead of Saturday's trip to West Ham. \n\"We are recovering that compactness, solidarity, effort, tactical discipline - these qualities that are very important when you are not flying,\" Mourinho added.
