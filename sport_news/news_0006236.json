Not at full health, the 6-foot-3, 230-pound junior has 17 catches for 128 yards and a touchdown so far this season. 11: National ranking in 3rd-down conversation rate \nThe Panthers have been successful on 50 percent of their 3rd-situations in four games this season, converting on 35 of 70 attempts. Only Rice and Northwestern have more total 3rd-down conversions this season (41). 9-2-3: Quarterback Alex McGough's TD-INT-SACK line in 2015 \nThose numbers are major improvements from what the sophomore quarterback was putting up as a rookie last year. In 2014, McGough finished with 14 touchdowns, 10 interceptions and was sacked 28 times. He's talented young quarterback who looks to be taking the next step. \n[ LISTEN: UMass Podcast: FIU preview with the Miami Herald's David J. Neal ] 6.5: McGough's yards per attempt \nThough he's playing efficiently, McGough hasn't been one to successfully use the deep ball all that much this year. His YPA ranks 94th in the nation after four games. It should be noted that Blake Frohnapfel ranks just a few slots above at 90th with 6.6 YPA. 0.250: Ron Turner's winning percentage at FIU \nTurner's record in two-plus seasons is 7-21. In 2011, his Panthers were a Charley Molnar-esque 1-11 before improving to 4-8 in 2014. This year, ESPN's FPI projects FIU to win at least six games. That's the kind of year-to-year improvement UMass fans are expecting. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:43:46.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
