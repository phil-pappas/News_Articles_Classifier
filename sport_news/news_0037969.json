Johnson has knee surgery on Tuesday to repair torn meniscus THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   2:16   2:16   \nPeople: \nMississippi (695) \n\nOXFORD, Mississippi â€” Mississippi linebacker C.J. Johnson had surgery on Tuesday to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee. \nThe 6-foot-2, 225-pound senior has started four games this season, making 17 tackles and grabbing two interceptions. School spokesman Kyle Campbell confirmed Johnson's surgery on Tuesday and said the linebacker is expected to need four to six weeks to recover. \nJohnson's injury is the latest blow to a defense that's already missing defensive tackle Issac Gross and safety Tony Conner. Gross is out for the season because of a neck injury while Conner is also recovering from a torn meniscus and will likely miss at least a few more weeks. \nNo. 14 Ole Miss (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) hosts New Mexico State (0-4) on Saturday in a non-conference game. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:37:17.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
