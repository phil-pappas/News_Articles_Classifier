Join the Conversation Varsity Insider Josh Thomson , jthomson@lohud.com 10:21 p.m. EDT October 9, 2015 \nNEW ROCHELLE When New Rochelle needed some dramatics and even some luck to win its first two games, there was plenty of caution behind the optimism. Was this one of Lou DiRienzo's powerhouses or another good-but-not-great version of his Huguenots? \nThat answer won't be totally clear for another few weeks, but New Rochelle has been thoroughly dominant since its modest start. The Huguenots throttled Mahopac in every phase of the game Friday night on Homecoming, beating the visiting Indians 34-7 at New Rochelle High School. \nSenior quarterback Greg Powell rushed for a pair of touchdowns and threw another to senior Jayson Prince and sophomore Romeo Holden added a 55-yard touchdown run. And that was just by halftime as the Huguenots (6-0) built a 28-0 halftime lead. \nThe victory likely clinched the No. 1 seed in Class AA for New Rochelle, which will host an opponent to be determined in next week's play-in round. The winner will advance to the Class AA quarterfinals the weekend of Oct. 23-24. \nThe Huguenots were spectacular on defense in the first half, holding Mahopac to just 42 yards and only one first down. Senior Tyler Cohen finished the night with three sacks and senior Keelan Thomas had an interception and a fumble recovery. \nStill, the game's highlight came in the second half when Mahopac broke through en route to what looked like a second blocked punt of the night. Instead, senior punter Dwayne \"Pat\" White-Edney — the younger brother of former New Rochelle stars Lewis and Khalil Edney — grabbed the snap and took off running. He not only picked up the first-down yardage, but escaped after appearing trapped on the sideline. White-Edney ended up taking the botched play 59 yards for a 34-0 Huguenot lead. \nMahopac's offense was limited with its starting quarterback, Dan Foley, and backup, Andrew Ryan, both sidelined. Foley, who hasn't played all season, missed his sixth straight game. Ryan didn't play after starting the last two weeks for senior Christian Donahoe, who returned to his normal post at running back. \nDonahoe provided Mahopac's lone score, returning a kickoff 80 yards shortly after the White-Edney touchdown.

Powell didn't need to do much in the second half, but that's only because he had already turned this into a one-sided game by halftime. By intermission, the senior quarterback had rushed for 67 yards and two touchdowns and hit on 5 of 7 for 69 yards, including a 29-yard scoring strike to Jayson Prince. \nTurning point: With New Rochelle up 7-0 and dominating, Mahopac — which had run just nine plays in three possessions by that point — created its own scoring opportunity. Senior Andrew Winogradoff blocked a New Rochelle punt and the Indians recovered at the Huguenot 25. But Mahopac fumbled on the next play. The ball was recovered by Keelan Thomas and the Huguenot were never threatened again until the game was out of reach. \nTwitter: @lohudinsider Buy Photo New Rochelle's Rashon McNeil breaks free of Mahopac Anthony Califano for a long punt return during the second quarter of a varsity football game at New Rochelle High School Oct. 9, 2015.
