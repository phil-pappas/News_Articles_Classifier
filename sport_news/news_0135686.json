At age 69, Tom Coughlin is the oldest head coach in the NFL. There are rumblings every season that Coughlin might decide to retire, and it remains a possibility that Coughlin could call it a career if the New York Giants miss the playoffs.\nAdChoices If that does happen, there is some belief that Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly would be a candidate to replace Coughlin.\nIf #Giants have an opening after this year, #NotreDame ’s Brian Kelly is a name that GMs pair with that job, based on his traits.\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 25, 2015\nCoughlin probably isn’t going anywhere. He may be the only two-time Super Bowl champion coach that ends up on the hot seat in Week 8 every season, but it’s highly unlikely that the Giants will fire him — even if one of Coughlin’s former players thinks he needs to go .\nKelly would be an interesting candidate for an NFL head coaching position. He has a record of 51-21 in five-plus seasons as coach of the Irish. He took the team to the BCS National Championship Game in 2012 but lost to Alabama.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/658294394576117760", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/tiki-barber-giants-should-fire-tom-coughlin/247720", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giants?src=hash", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotreDame?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:29:58.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
