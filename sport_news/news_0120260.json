(Brian Blanco/Associated Press) \nThis is The Insider’s running game-day thread. It’s mainly for discussion, but if you refresh from time to time, you’ll get updates. The thread begins with pregame reading, TV and radio info and more. Then, inactives post about 90 minutes before the 1 p.m. kickoff. During the game, there are frequent updates on our live blog, and this thread updates infrequently, although we’ll add a photo gallery and live-updating box score. At game’s end, this thread will point toward the quick version of the game story and the D.C. Sports Bog’s best and worst, and that’ll be it here — the postgame news conferences and traditional coverage continue on the blog. \nMeantime, for a Week 7 game between teams with losing records, there sure is a lot riding on this, at least on the Washington side. \nHead into the bye week at 3-4, and the argument for tangible progress from last year’s 4-12 season is solid. Head in at 2-5, with three consecutive losses, and there are two long weeks to wonder whether Kirk Cousins is the right quarterback and Jay Gruden the right coach for this team. \nThe Bucs, who won 27-7 at FedEx Field last season in maybe the low-point game for Washington, are now led by rookie quarterback and No. 1 overall pick, Jameis Winston. \nHere are the basics: Kickoff: 1 p.m. at FedEx Field TV: Ch. 5. (Fox). DirecTV Sunday Ticket 708. Radio: 980 AM ; 92.7 and 94.3 FM. Sirius XM 225; internet 831. Line: Redskins by 3, o/u 42.5.
