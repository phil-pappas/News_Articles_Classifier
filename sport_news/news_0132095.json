But he practiced again Wednesday and has been on the field with the Texans for nearly two weeks, incrementally gaining strength and endurance with an eye toward playing in October.\nIn Foster's absence, Alfred Blue leads the Texans with 187 yards on 45 carries, including 31 carries for 139 yards last week against the Buccaneers.\nO'Brien said with no further setbacks, the Texans would likely decide just before kickoff whether Foster will be active for Sunday's game. Foster said he will not play until he's 100 percent healthy. \nAlso on Wednesday, Texans signed defensive end Kourtnei Brown to their roster from the Buccaneers' practice squad.\nDuring the preseason, Brown led the Texans with three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent out of Clemson in 2012.\nIn addition, the Texans filled a slot on the practice squad by re-signing quarterback Zac Dysert, who was cut last week and worked out for the New England Patriots on Tuesday.\n  Texans RB Foster questionable for Sunday Houston Texans RB Arian Foster returns to practice Houston Texans RB Arian Foster to undergo groin surgery Texans' Duane Brown added to Pro Bowl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:30:53.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
