He showed off his arm strength on the 40-yard touchdown pass to Ricardo Lockette and on an earlier near miss to Tyler Lockett, and he obviously established a report with Jimmy Graham. But Wilson couldn’t move the offense when he had to in the fourth quarter, leading to another squandered lead.

Photo-8814252.118923   10 Running backs: There wasn’t a ton of running room for Marshawn Lynch, who finished the game averaging 3.2 yards on 17 carries, but he seemingly made the most of every opportunity. Unfortunately, his holding penalty on former Washington Huskies star Shaq Thompson killed Seattle’s final offensive drive with the lead. Fred Jackson, Thomas Rawls and Will Tukuafu all played pretty well. Overall, an average day.

Lockette came up with a huge touchdown catch after committing two costly penalties. Jermaine Kearse looked like he was looking for flags instead of finishing plays on two of his three targets, while Doug Baldwin was quiet.

Photo-8812439.118923   10 Offensive line: With Patrick Lewis starting at center for Drew Nowak, the line seemed improved in pass protection for much of the game. The tradeoff is there wasn’t a lot of room for Lynch, which prevented Seattle from holding onto the lead late. Justin Britt had a rough game, pushed around on a couple of running plays and beaten badly on a key sack early in the fourth quarter. Russell Okung wasn’t great, either.

Photo-8813430.118923   10 Defensive line: Cliff Avril continues to play at a ridiculously high level, forcing an interception and a sack with his pressure. Michael Bennett made a couple of plays in what was a quiet day for him, while Brandon Mebane and Ahtyba Rubin helped keep the Panthers’ run game at bay for more of the contest. They couldn’t get pressure on Newton down the stretch when it counted, though, and gave up four scoring drives of 80 yards or more.

Photo-8815074.118923   10 Linebackers: Bruce Irvin should put Sunday’s game on loop during free agency next offseason. The 2012 first-round pick came up with two sacks, another tackle for loss and even ran step-for-step with Greg Olsen in coverage downfield on one occasion. K.J. Wright was OK replacing Bobby Wagner, while Kevin Pierre-Louis had more misses than hits in coverage versus Olsen. Irvin's performance brings their grade up.

Photo-8812014.118923 - seattlepi.com Image 7 of 10 Defensive backs: Earl Thomas had another good effort, with an interception and a whopping four passes defended. He would have had another pick if it hadn’t been broken up by Cary Williams, who had another mediocre to bad outing. Of course, this game will be remembered for the blown coverage on the Panthers’ last offensive play, which led to Olsen’s game-winning touchdown after there was miscommunication in the secondary.

Meanwhile, Jon Ryan averaged a whopping 50.1 yards per punt, but just missed out on pinning the Panthers deep on their final possession. Lockett didn’t do much in the return game, however, averaging just 13.5 yards on two kickoff returns and 7.0 yards on four punt returns. Grade: C+ Special teams: The kicking was fine.

Coaches have to take responsibility for getting the right calls into their players, and no doubt Kris Richard will take his share of criticism for that. Offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell got cute on the second-to-last drive in the fourth quarter, giving the Panthers more clock to work with.
