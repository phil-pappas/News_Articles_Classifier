Maybe it is the start for many, many goals,\" the former Bayern Munich coach said. \nVan Gaal's opposite number Roberto Martinez denied his players were affected by the \"really sad\" news of Kendall's death before kick-off. \nThe Spaniard admitted his team never looked like recovering from Schneiderlin's maiden strike for United. \n\"We were affected by the first goal too much,\" the Everton manager said. \n\"That stopped us from being brighter. We were frustrated by that. \n\"It wasn't our day. We have to get back to preparing the game well and react at the weekend.\" \nOn the death of Kendall, the club's greatest ever manager, Martinez said: \"It was a shock, really sad news. \n\"It was a very emotional moment when we found out but we reacted in the right way, celebrating his career and what he gave to Everton. He will always be an inspiration to any manager of this football club.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:21:58.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
