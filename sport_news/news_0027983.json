(Photo by Carl Elmore/For the Savannah Morning News) By KARSON HOAGLAND Despite the cool autumn air Sunday, the 13 teams in the 2015 Mattress Dash worked up quite a sweat.\nThe racecourse reached 75 yards into Forsyth Park, and along with the uneven sidewalk along the stretch, the five-person teams also had to watch out for their competitors — some of whom had creations literally fall apart on the course.\nTommy Linstroth, who both founded and currently runs Sustainativity, said that the nonprofit began two years ago to “green” other nonprofits in the community.\nThis year Sustainativity partnered with Senior Citizens Inc., with whom it will be working on a lighting retrofit in its facility and a project to retrofit some of its Meals on Wheels truck to hybrids. In the past Sustainativity also worked with the Second Harvest Food Bank and the Historic Savannah Foundation.\nLinstroth said he hoped to raise $6,000 to $7,000 at the mattress dash event, in which more than 200 people turned out on Sunday.\n“We’re not a traditional nonprofit, so we don’t do traditional fundraising,” Linstroth said. Sustainativity has a fall event — the mattress dash — and a spring event on April 23 — Green Tie One On for Second Harvest — to raise money for the sustainability projects. Linstroth said 100 percent of donations and funds raised go to those projects. Everyone on the board of the nonprofit, all the workers at Sunday’s event and even Linstroth himself volunteer their time.\nOne of the big changes this year was a pre-race parade that allowed the teams to walk their creations down the racecourse and get a feel for whether they might fall apart. From the get-go, one team in particular seemed to be having a rough time.\n“In their defense, they did this yesterday after meeting at Geekend this weekend,” Linstroth explained about the group, Maven Makers, as the back wheels of their frame began wobbling uncontrollably. Later in the races, the Maven Makers would wind up carrying the back half of their Lite-Brite themed frame to a win against the Five Points Beverage team.\nThe 13 teams were paired off in head to head races, which they did twice — for time. Then the top four teams competed head to head in knockout races, and the final two teams raced for the championship.\nOnce again, Thunderbolt Marine’s team, Panda-monium, took home the win with their bamboo mattress frame and panda-dressed mascot.\n“Last year, our frame wasn’t very sustainable, and it was really heavy,” said Jessica Weimerskirk, mascot of team Panda-monium. “This year we went with the Panda theme to be more sustainable and a lot lighter, because it’s made of bamboo.”\nDIRTT, or Doing It Right This Time — Environmental Solutions, was the runner-up, crossing the finish just seconds behind Panda-monium — and taking out the inflatable Fleet Feet finish line at the same time.\nThe teams also won awards for the People’s Choice, Judge’s Choice and Greenest Creation categories. Walk of Shame, which had beer pong set up before the race, won People’s Choice. The Sleighers, composed of SCAD industrial design faculty and one student, won the Judge’s Choice; and the Greenest Creation award went to the city of Savannah’s Raised Bed Garden frame.\nTHE PARTICIPANTS\n• Panda-monium (Thunderbolt Marine)\n• DIRTT\n• Mousekateers (Thomas and Hutton)\n• Walk of Shame\n• Maven Makers\n• Five Points Beverage\n• Sleighers (SCAD industrial design)\n• Raised Bed Garden (city of Savannah)\n• Meals on Wheels (Senior Citizens Inc.)\n• Gulfstream\n• The Monkeys\n• Metro Savannah Rotary Club\n• Game of Thrones", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14819689.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14819688.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14819686.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14819687.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14819687.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14819686.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14819688.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14819689.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:15:56.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
