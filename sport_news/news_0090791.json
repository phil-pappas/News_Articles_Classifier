The money would come from the city's annual budget revisions -- the subject of a council work session Tuesday.\nAccording to the city's Bureau of Fire and Police Disability and Retirement, as many as 218 officers will be eligible to retire over the next five years. The Police Bureau separately estimates the number is closer to 292.\nLast fiscal year, 27 Portland police retired. Another 30 officers will be eligible to retire this fiscal year, 30 more in fiscal year 2016-17, and between 30 and 40 officers annually for the three following years.\nPolice Chief Larry O'Dea said the bureau has been struggling with lean staffing since the city eliminated 50 sworn and five non-sworn positions two years ago.\n\"Increasing the recruitment capacity and the speed of the background investigation and hiring processes are critical to the bureau's success in maintaining pace with the rate of attrition and in ensuring successful hiring from a pool of applicants that are being recruited by many agencies across the country,'' O'Dea wrote to the city's budget office director.\nCurrently, there are nine background investigators. It takes five to seven months for an investigator to complete one background check on a recruit, according to the city.\nTo fill current vacancies and meet minimum patrol shift staffing, the Police Bureau must pay officers overtime to work extra shifts.\nThe number of overtime hours worked to meet the bureau's minimum shift requirements has grown 52 percent this fiscal year, from 119,000 hours in 2013-14 to a projected 181,000 hours this fiscal year, according to the city budget office.\n\"This level of overtime is not sustainable from either a budget or operational perspective,'' city budget analyst Christy Owen said.\nPortland Police Bureau overtime Overtime hours Overtime paid Overtime budgeted Fiscal year 2010-11 122,367 $6,357,488 $7,110,903 Fiscal year 2011-12 163,441 $8,910,428 $7,649,040 Fiscal year 2012-13 121,522 $6,868,713 $7,306,762 Fiscal year 2013-14 96,713 $5,437,990 $6,928,592 Fiscal year 2014-15 132,270 $7,654,791 $6,857,000 Fiscal year 2015-16 (July 1st-present) 52,075 $3,129,088 $6,900,000 Â» Download an Excel table with all the Portland Police Bureau's overtime costs for the past five years.\nAccording to Police Bureau figures, the bureau exceeded by $800,000 its overtime budget in the 2014-15 fiscal year, paying out a total of $7.6 million. Four months into the current fiscal year started July 1, the bureau has spent nearly half of its budgeted $6.9 million in overtime pay.\n\"We're spending a lot on overtime, and we're working our officers really hard,'' Hales said.\nThe bureau estimates that it would need to hire at least 130 new recruits this year -- which all agree is an impossible task -- and about 30 each year for the next five years to keep pace with retirements and maintain current staffing levels.\nThe Police Bureau requested $598,524 in one-time general fund money to hire 11 background investigators. The bureau also has asked for about $108,000 to hire two additional recruiters to help \"increase the volume and diversity'' of police applicants.\nThe city's budget office recommends the council provide financing for the extra background investigators, but not for new recruiters.\nIt also recommended that the Police Bureau provide the council \"a clear plan'' for how patrol and specialty units will function at the current staffing levels during the next five years and outline future recruitment and hiring.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-26T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:26.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
