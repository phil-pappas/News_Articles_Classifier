Related Eagles D dominates Saints \nThe Patriots (4-0) weren't the same offensive juggernaut as their first three games, but New England did more than enough coming off a bye week to wear down the undermanned Cowboys. \nBrady and the Patriots came in averaging nearly 40 points in their first three wins. They won this one with defense, giving up a season-low points total. \nBrady worked around five sacks -- all in the first half -- to pass for 275 yards (20 of 27) with two scores and no interceptions. The veteran has 11 touchdown passes this season and has yet to throw a pick. \nNew England wide receiver Julian Edelman caught four passes for 120 yards and a touchdown. Tight end Rob Gronkowski caught four balls for 67 yards. Running back LeGarrette Blount had 74 yards rushing. \nThe Cowboys (2-3) lost their third straight game as they continue on without quarterback Tony Romo and receiver Dez Bryant. Those injuries are hampering an offense that can't stretch the field or mount a consistent rushing attack. \nDallas quarterback Brandon Weeden didn't do much more than dink and dump underneath against a New England defense that often kept eight men in the box. \nWeeden passed for only 188 yards, completing 26 of 39 with one interception. \nThe Cowboys were 4-for-14 on third-down conversions and were held to 264 yards, their lowest output of the season. \nBrady engineered an 80-yard touchdown drive to open the second half for a 20-3 lead. Running back Dion Lewis capped the march with a 10-yard catch on a Brady pass. \nA 59-yard catch-and-run from Brady to Edelman early in the fourth quarter put the game away. \nThe Patriots went into the locker room up 13-3 on Brady's rushing touchdown and two field goals by kicker Stephen Gostkowski, including a 57-yarder at the end of the first half. \nNew England wasn't able to do much with the ball in the first half as Brady was constantly under pressure. \nA pair of Dallas defenders fresh off suspensions -- linebacker Rolando McLain and end Greg Hardy -- sacked Brady on each of New England's first two drives. \nMcLain's sack knocked the Patriots out of the field-goal range on their first drive. Hardy's tackle forced New England to settle for Gostkowski's 49-yard kick. \nThe Cowboys tied it at 3-3 with a 50-yard field goal from kicker Dan Bailey late in the first quarter. \nNew England scored the game's first touchdown on Brady's sneak from the 1-yard line with 3:39 left until halftime to make it 10-3.As much as the Patriots struggled, the Cowboys were worse. Dallas managed just 59 total yards through two quarters. \nNOTES: Cowboys DE Greg Hardy and LB Rolando McLain made their season debuts after completing four-game suspensions. Dallas inactives: WR Dez Bryant, DE Randy Gregory, WR Brice Butler, QB Kellen Moore, OL La'el Collins, DE Ryan Russell and TE James Hanna. New England inactives: DT Khyri Thornton, LB Jon Bostic, WR Aaron Dobson, DE Rufus Johnson, C/G Ryan Wendell, S Tavon Wilson, DE Trey Flowers. Of the group, the biggest surprise was Dobson, as the team went with just three pure wide receivers, activating Keshawn Martin over Dobson. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
