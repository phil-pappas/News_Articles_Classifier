The reason UAPB hasn’t been able to turn those solid first half into victories has been frankly horrendous third quarters throughout the season. \nWeek 1 a 7-0 lead for South Carolina State at the break turned into a 28-7 lead entering the fourth quarter. Week 3 saw UAPB let a 13-7 halftime lead become a 24-20 fourth-quarter deficit. Last week the Lions were up 9-7 after 30 minutes but another poor 15 minute-span allowed Alabama A&M to turn the game around with a 21-point third period. \n“We were flat for whatever reason (coming out of halftime against A&M),” Lions head coach Monte Coleman said earlier this week. “That’s kind of been the Achilles’ heel for us this season. The third quarter has kind of hindered us from putting up points or stopping opposing teams.” \nAll told, UAPB has been outscored 59-14 in the four third quarters it has played this season. \n“We’ve gone back to the drawing board to see what it’s going to take for us to play better football in the third quarter,” Coleman said. “And we will come up with a solution to play better in the third quarter.” \nThe problem needs to be addressed in a hurry with defending Southwestern Athletic Conference and BOXTOROW National champion Alcorn State on the schedule Saturday. The Braves (3-1, 2-0) enter as the top-ranked team in the BOXTOROW Coaches Poll and No. 2 in the BOXTOROW Media Poll. \nThe game is set to take place at 4 p.m. at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock. It will mark the first trip to the Capital City since 2012 for the Lions (0-2 SWAC). It will also be the culmination of a busy week for Coleman and UAPB. \nEarly Thursday morning, the university hosted a pep rally at Golden Lion Stadium complete with cheerleaders, the M4 band and television coverage. Later that night, Coleman and a handful of other former NFL players took part in the first-ever Legends and Legacies event at the Clinton Presidential Center. The goal of the night was to raise money for the UAPB football scholarship fund. \n“There are a lot of festivities involved with this game, but we will be focused,” Coleman had said on Tuesday. “We will start out preparation on the field with the team (Tuesday). Everything from here on out is about Alcorn.” \nIf the Lions are going to upset the Braves, it’s going to take better performances coming out of the halftime break. UAPB has shown an ability to get off to decent starts. A seven-point deficit, tied score, six-point lead and two-point lead don’t lie, but the third quarters have been dismal. \nColeman hopes his players have come up with the solution. \n“We will put emphasis on it,” he said. “We’re asking the players. Some players are saying our halftimes are too long. We need to go in, make our adjustments like we do and then come on back out and start getting ready for the game. And that’s what we’ll try, we’ll try that; and if that’s the problem, then hopefully we’ll eliminate that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:23:54.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
