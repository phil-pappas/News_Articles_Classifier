It’s diverse in a lot of ways. It’s all different cultures that come to this one city and live here. I mean, it’s crazy. So you get all of that mix (chuckle) and you get to see different walks of life of how people were raised or how they grew up, and people accept you for who you are.\nQ: Do you have a sense for how this city is kind of adopting the Mets? \nA: When any New York team plays good, the city is behind ’em 100 percent. They support ’em as best they can. It’s been a lot of Met fans who have been suffering over the years, so like I said, they’re just trying to be very supportive for the team.\nQ: Do you have any favorite New York athletes? \nA: Probably … Jackie Robinson … Derek Jeter.\nQ: Did you enjoy watching Jeter play? \nA: Sometimes you watch people and they do things effortlessly, and he’s one of those guys. I know it’s a lot of stuff behind the scenes that he does, studying the game and knowing the game. You see a focus and an awareness that he has. Derek Jeter is by far the best baseball player I’ve seen — I’ve seen. I’m only 30 years old (laugh).\nQ: Have you made any concessions to age yet as far as diet or workout regimen? \nA: I think I’ve been solid on my diet since I tore my ACL [in 2012]. That whole deal just kind of made me revamp how I approach the game a little bit more. Stay healthy, that’s the biggest thing as you get older, just you gotta stay healthy.\nQ: After the ACL, you cut out certain foods? \nA: I cut out a lot of things in my life (laugh). I was in a tough spot at the time, a very dark place for me, so I just had to revamp a lot of stuff.\nQ: You said you cut out a lot of things … such as? \nA: I’m not telling you all that (laugh), but I just changed a whole bunch of stuff and it’s helped my game now where I’m at.\nQ: Describe strong safety Calvin Pryor. \nA: He’s very confident. He walks around with confidence. He plays with confidence. He’s in the right position — last year he had to play free [safety], so this year he’s in the right position. You can tell he’s more comfortable, and he’s making more plays.\nQ: Free safety Marcus Gilchrist. \nA: He’s our quarterback back there. By far one of the best safeties I’ve ever been around. Followed him in San Diego. When you actually work with somebody on a day-to-day basis, you see how talented and how gifted he is.\nQ: Rookie defensive lineman Leonard Williams. \nA: Leonard’s the Golden Child (chuckle). He has a lot of talent, a lot of potential, and … it’s scary (chuckle). He’s getting it. It’s always a learning curve, going from college to NFL, and he’s jumped on it pretty quick. The sky’s the limit for him and his talent.\nBrandon Marshall Photo: AP Q: Other than his physical talents, what about Brandon Marshall makes him an elite receiver? \nA: I think a lot of people don’t give Brandon a lot of credit for how smart he is. He understands the game, his football IQ is very high. And the conversations we always have, it’s always about football, or angles — you line up this way, I line up this way, I’m thinking this. His football IQ skyrockets out the roof.\nQ: Did you just have a natural football IQ or is that something you developed by all the study you do? \nA: I think my game has evolved into, once I see things once or twice, or maybe three times, I understand, I get it. You can’t fool me (chuckle). And that goes into that whole Peyton Manning-type of deal. Like he could see something and adjust from it that fast, and I try to do the same thing. It’s just basically you see that picture, and you just frame it. You frame the picture that you see by watching film, and once you see it out in practice a number of times, and then you see it on Sunday, you’re like looking at the shot, because you know they’re about to run that play.\nQ: So that must be some chess game between you and Peyton and you and Tom Brady. \nA: Oh yeah, definitely, by far. Brady’s another one. His competitiveness, and his love for the game, I think a lot of people don’t talk about no more. The love of the game. And, there’s certain guys that take it to a next level because of their love of the game, whether if it’s studying, whether if it’s competing, they want to be the best of all time. And you see that week to week.\nQ: Do you think Brady’s the best of all time? \nA: Yeah. I’ll say so.\nQ: Does he approach practice the same way you do? \nA: Oh yes, definitely, no doubt, there’s no doubt. I mean, Brady, every practice [he would say]: “I’m coming at you today 2-4.” [I would say] “Bring it!” You know me. We’re gonna duke this out and see who falls at the end of the day, and that’s what you love about great players. They don’t back down from a challenge, no matter what it may be. That’s when the respect comes in too as well.\nQ: Why do you practice the way you practice? \nA: Because I feel those situations are gonna come up in a game, and why not be prepared? It’s like in school, you gotta study for the test to make a good grade. You can’t just come in there and wing it and just think (laugh), “I’m gonna get an A.” It may be setting a standard, but at the same time it’s, “I need to do this to get prepared for what’s about to come Sunday,” so I’ll rather be overprepared than be underprepared (chuckle).\nTom Brady Photo: AP Q: Do you think Brady is motivated by Deflategate? \nA: I don’t know. That’s a question that you would probably have to ask him. I know personally Brady is competitive, he just wants to win games, and … that’s him. He’s probably one of the fierce competitors I’ve been around.\nQ: How weird is it going to be for you walking into Foxborough next week, and what kind of reception do you think you’ll get? \nA: It’s not gonna be weird at all. I’ve played there with different color jerseys on. It’s a familiar place to me, I’m going out there to play a game.\nQ: Do you think you’ll be cheered, booed, both? \nA: I don’t really care about that, I’m gonna play a game. … I’ve been booed, I’ve been cheered, I’ve seen it all.\nQ: Describe coach Todd Bowles. \nA: He wants to dominate. That’s his approach, is to dominate, and we have the talent to do it. Do I want to dominate? I think everybody in this locker room personally wants to dominate and make plays and help the team win. Everybody wants to do that. I think collectively, if we have the same approach, which we do. … He leads and we follow behind him, and we gotta take his approach.\nQ: Odell Beckham Jr. \nA: Is he a talent, yes, he’s pretty awesome. He has a lot of potential.\nQ: Your son Jayden is 7 and plays quarterback. Would you let him play football later on in life? \nA: Whatever he wants to do. I’m not a parent who forces my child to do anything. If he wants to do it, I’m gonna just tell him, “Do it 100 percent.”\nQ: Does he remind you of you at a similar age? \nA: I’ve been to a couple of his football games. It’s weird. … It’s like you’re seeing like a smaller you (laugh). He has a unique game to himself. He’s very aggressive. He’s tough, he’s tough.\nQ: He plays both ways. Does he wear 24? \nA: Naw, naw. He wears his own number. I was talking to somebody the other day, and they were like, “Your son doesn’t wear your number.” It’s like, “Naw, he needs to have his own identity.”\nQ: What number does he wear? \nA: 21.\nQ: Describe the personality of your 9-year-old daughter, your daughter Deyani Shavae. \nA: Laidback, she’s kind of chill. She does cheering and she plays basketball.\nQ: What’s it like being one of New York’s Most Eligible Bachelors? \nA: (Laugh) As for right now, I like it that way. Whenever I meet her, I hope she’s an awesome woman, and we (laugh) could take it to that next level.\nDarrelle Revis Photo: AP Q: What would be your definition of an ideal mate? \nA: Someone just genuine, down to earth … supportive. I’m not difficult.\nQ: Would marriage be something after football is over? \nA: I don’t know. It depends on that special woman that I meet. Depending on how it goes, we’ll see.\nQ: I’m trying to hook you up here. \nA: I see, I see (laugh).\nQ: Describe your island. \nA: It’s a place where I feel comfortable at. It’s a good place. It’s a good place for me.\nQ: To bring a ring back to New York, what would that mean for your legacy? \nA: I’m not really concerned about my legacy, it’s just I’m a winner. I came from a prestigious high school of winning, so that’s all I know (chuckle). I won a state championship my senior year. Should have won my junior year, we lost in the state playoff. … I should have two (chuckle) state championships, but that’s all I know. That’s all I know, is to work hard, and win.\nQ: Who presents you at the Hall of Fame? \nA: (Laugh) Oh, man. Am I going to the Hall of Fame? Is that the word on the street?\nQ: You’re already in. \nA: I have no idea. … Let me get back to you on that.\nQ: What drives you now? \nA: Winning … having great guys around that want to win as well. … If I could sit here and have the perfect career, I’m going in my ninth year, I wish I could have won all nine Super Bowls (chuckle). That’s just not realistic.\nQ: But even now you’re as hungry to win as you ever were? \nA: I’ve always been hungry. I’m just getting older, and as you get older, time ticks. You gotta win. You have to win.\nQ: Winning a Super Bowl here in New York, how optimistic are you that you’ll help this organization win one? \nA: I’m not gonna put any added pressure. … We all would love to win one here, especially because it’s been 40-plus years. Do we have the talent to do it? Yeah we do have the talent to do it. We gotta keep getting better. Even last year, when we started off 2-2 in New England, and everybody was writing us off, but we actually clicked around that time. Here, we clicked from the beginning of the season, which is awesome, too. We can’t be up and down. We just gotta stay consistent, rack some more wins up, hopefully contend for the division, and get in the postseason. And then once you get in the postseason, depending on how the ball rolls, if you get that first-round bye, it’ll only take you two games. If we can pull that off, it’s that more closer up it. So we just gotta continue to just keep working, and if we do, I think everybody at the end of this will look back and say, “Wow, we actually did something special.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brandon marshall ,  calvin pryor ,  darrelle revis ,  leonard williams ,  marcus gilchrist ,  new york jets ,  serby's q&a", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:51:35.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
