Timber! after loss to Portland SANDY — On Wednesday night, Real Salt Lake played its most important game of the season. A win would keep their playoff hopes alive, while a loss would make the road harder, if not impossible.\nPortland came into the game with less of a need to win. In that situation, one might have expected the Timbers to sit back and absorb RSL ’s attack. Instead, Caleb Porter loaded up his frontline with four attackers.\nReal neutralized the overloaded attack throughout the first half with a high defensive line and, in fact, played very good possession soccer out of the midfield once they cleared the Portland blockage.\nThe halftime ended with both teams tied 0-0.\nThe second half started out bad for RSL and got worse from there. Joao Plata went down with a hamstring injury only minutes into the second half, and Jamison Olave was sent of with what will undoubtedly be the most scrutinized red card in MLS this week. Olave’s offense came just inside the 18-yard box, and Portland striker Fanendo Adi put home the PK to give Portland the win.\nHere are the player grades for the game with the Timbers.\nNick Rimando (GK), 10 , had his first significant action in the 22nd minute when he saved a fastbreak, point-blank Adi shot to keep RSL’s momentum alive. His 45th-minute save on another Adi fastbreak added to Portland’s frustration and was his best of the night. Unfortunately, couldn't stop Adi for a third time when Olave’s red card put him at the penalty spot for Portland’s lone goal.\nJamison Olave (DEF), 10 , was on his game against Portland. He was excellent in the air and especially potent along RSL’s high defensive line in keeping the massive Portland attack from creating much of a press. Olave was dealt a harsh blow when he was given a red card for what referee Juan Guzman perceived to be a takedown on Lucas Melano just inside the 18-yard box.\nAaron Maund (DEF), 10, did well to pickup Portland on the break and was at his finest with attackers coming at him with speed where he used his size and athleticism to keep things controlled.\nTony Beltran (DEF), 10 , was typically solid in an atypical role for him. He played left back with Demar Phillips and Abdoulie Manually off the game roster. Beltran was especially valuable helping Kyle Beckerman with the buildup out of the backfield down the left flank.\nJordan Allen (DEF), 8 , played blue-collar defensive soccer. While he certainly played into the attack along the right wing when called upon, RSL’s left side was the typical launching point of its attack, and Allen had plenty to deal with in Portland’s speed-tricky Darlington Nagbe and whichever Portland striker wandered into his zone.\nLuke Mulholland (MID), 8 , seemed distracted much of the first half by Portland’s formation. He seemed caught between the attack and defending and sometimes struggled with his passes and positioning as a result. The second half was much better as he settled into a more defensive role and was an important reason Portland didn’t mount much of an attack after its goal.\nJavier Morales (MID), 10 , continues to be the keystone of the RSL attack. He partnered well with Juan Manuel Martinez, Sebastian Jaime and Joao Plata to create numerous attacking opportunities and, for the most part, the momentum of the game despite being outshot by Portland.\nKyle Beckerman (MID), 10 , played all 120 minutes of the U.S. Men’s National Team loss Saturday. But four days are all Major League Soccer’s fittest player needed to start for the Claret and Cobalt and set the tone. His heroic effort, especially in the second half wasn’t enough to keep RSL in the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:11:46.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
