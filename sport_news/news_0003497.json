(Andy Lyons / Getty Images) Associated Press \nPeyton Barber rushed for two short touchdowns, including a three-yarder with 7:56 remaining, helping Auburn outlast Kentucky, 30-27, Thursday night and earn its first Southeastern Conference victory. \nSorely needing a conference win in hopes of contending in the West division, the Tigers (4-2, 1-2 SEC) started and closed strong behind Barber, who rushed for a one-yard touchdown on their opening drive. His second score was the biggest, providing a critical buffer against Mikel Horton's one-yard touchdown run with 4:06 left that brought Kentucky within a field goal. \nBarber finished with 92 yards in 26 carries, and Kerryon Johnson added 36 yards, including a six-yard touchdown. Sean White threw for 255 yards, 154 to Ricardo Louis as the Tigers won their ninth straight in Lexington. \nKentucky's final attempt to at least tie the game ended with quarterback Patrick Towles being sacked on fourth down with 25 seconds left. \nAuburn was outgained, 497-407, but made several timely plays of both sides of the ball, including the defensive stand that denied Kentucky three yards on two plays on its final drive. \nAuburn hasn't always played like that after starting the season ranked sixth before falling out of the top 25, but the Tigers made Kentucky (4-2, 2-2) play catch-up all night and maintained its dominance at Commonwealth Stadium. \nMagic statue vandalized \nA statue of Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson on the campus of Michigan State University has been vandalized with yellow paint ahead of the Spartans' football game against rival Michigan. \nThe statue of the former NBA and Michigan State basketball star is outside the Breslin Center in East Lansing.
