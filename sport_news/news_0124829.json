They only scored more than 26 points twice during the losing streak — 28 and 27 in losses last season. In fact, they had only scored in double figures seven times in the 24 losses. \nMolina capped a 15-play, 66-yard drive with a 6-yard run at 9:47. Wager (0-5) bobbled the snap on its next play and Keefe scooped up the bouncing ball at the 2 and stepped into the end zone. \nAfter quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg scampered 32 yards to put Columbia up 24-0 early in the second quarter, the Lions picked up a safety on the ensuing kickoff. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:23:19.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
