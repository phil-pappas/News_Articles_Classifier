Our practices were great. We got better every day as the season went on,” coach Laurie Puddester said about her North Smithfield High girls tennis team after the Northmen completed a perfect 16-0 season and a two-year, 31-match undefeated string with a 4-0 victory over Chariho in the title match of the Division III state team tournament on Saturday at Slater Park. Twelve of the Northmen’s 16 victories this season were shutouts, including both their semifinal and final matches of the state tournament, which is stopped when one team posts the four victories needed for a team triumph. The Northmen never gave up more than two points in any of their 14 regular-season matches where there are four singles and three matches contested. One of the teams that did manage to collect a point off the Northmen during the regular season was Chariho, which dropped a 6-1 decision in their Division III-A and III-B subdivision crossover. That was the Chargers' only loss in 15 Division III matches before Saturday. It took North Smithfield only about an hour on Saturday to collect the four points needed for its second straight state title and its third D-III state crown since 2010. Hailey Raskob, Brianna Boudreau and Alexis LaBelle all delivered quick straight-set triumphs at first, second and third singles, respectively, and the duo of Emily Larson and Alyana Kozlik rolled to a 6-1, 6-1 victory at first doubles. “They are a great group of girls,” Puddester added. “We never took anyone for granted. At practice we would work on things that we not so comfortable with, just trying to get better.” Although they didn’t finish their match before action was suspended, the North Smithfield second doubles team of Julia Kasanovich and Sarah Pugliese were well on the way to adding another triumph to their undefeated record this season. “All our singles players had only one loss, but our second doubles team was undefeated, just like last season,” said Puddester. — jgillool@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:37:22.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
