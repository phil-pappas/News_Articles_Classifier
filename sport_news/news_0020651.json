I’m not playing for the rest of this week.”\nRozier, whose left knee was heavily taped, was playing well prior to the injury. Naturally, he didn’t want something like a knee-to-knee collision to get in the way of his second exhibition game.\n“I thought I could just get through it, but lesson learned from that,” he said.\nBut now is not the time to push a player through unnecessary strain, according to Brad Stevens .\n“The goal is to be healthy and ready to roll on Oct. 28,” said the Celtics coach.\nJones in mourning\nWhen Perry Jones received news that a close cousin had died back in Texas while the Celtics were touring Europe, Stevens didn’t bother to debate the issue, or discuss whether it was advisable for Jones to go see his family.\n“I told him (to go),” said the Celtics coach.\nJones had returned to the team by yesterday’s practice, trying hard to conceal his grief.\n“I can’t talk about it right now. I’d get too emotional,” he said. “I spent time with family. It’s a tough time, just a few days to spend with the family was important to me. From a mental standpoint it was a good thing I went, preparing for what will happen in the future.”\nJones, who only played seven minutes on the trip — a two-point, two-rebound performance against Olimpia Milan — is in a fight to make the roster. He has some lost time to make up.\n“There’s a few things I have to catch up on, but that will be easy with my teammates helping me,” he said. . . .\nJonas Jerebko (illness) returned to practice yesterday. Evan Turner , still suffering from a strained right knee that forced him to miss both games in Europe, was again a spectator at yesterday’s practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:56:17.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
