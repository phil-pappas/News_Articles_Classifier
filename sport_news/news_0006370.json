(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) \nLONDON (AP) — The latest at the Rugby World Cup (all times local): \n4 p.m. \nWith the first Rugby World Cup quarterfinal about to kick off at Twickenham under a gray sky, here’s the good news: South Africa and Wales are unchanged. \nThere was plenty of drama before the match, as Ireland linchpin Jonny Sexton had to withdraw from their quarterfinal against Argentina on Sunday, and Scotland suddenly gained forwards Ross Ford and Jonny Gray, who won their appeals and were cleared to play in their quarterfinal against Australia, also on Sunday. \nSexton hurt his groin in a big tackle by France’s Louis Picamoles last weekend, but was picked to play this weekend. However, the groin tightened up after training on Friday, and Ireland decided not to risk its star flyhalf. Ireland therefore starts without four major players: Sexton, captain Paul O’Connell, and flankers Sean O’Brien and Peter O’Mahony. Ian Madigan will start against the Pumas at flyhalf. \nFord and Gray were cleared of making a dangerous tackle against Samoa last weekend, but whether they are late inclusions in the Scotland team is in doubt. They were not picked in the matchd squad of 23 on Friday. \nMeanwhile, the Springboks and Welsh have warmed up at Twickenham and are set to meet in a quarterfinal for the first time, and in the World Cup for only the second time. Despite Welsh fans having the advantage of being almost on home soil, there’s a huge amount of fans in Springboks colors. They had the benefit of believing their team would win their pool, and bought the appropriate tickets. Although, that opening loss to Japan would have given them chills. \nNew Zealand and France were playing later Saturday at Cardiff in the second quarterfinal match.
