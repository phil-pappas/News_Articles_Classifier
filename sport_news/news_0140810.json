Noted environmentalist Chandi Prasad Bhatt, who is known for his Himalayan, environmental and Ganga conservation works, says unless a mass movement similar to the Chipko movement of 70’s in Garhwal hills for saving trees is launched, no government initiative such as the Ganga Action Plan or recent ‘Namami Gange’ will achieve the desired results. Bhatt says we should dwell on how to increase the water level in the Ganga as well as in her tributaries such as the Bhagirathi, Alaknanda, Mandakini, Pindar, Dhauli Ganga and the Yamuna. “We must simultaneously ensure that these rivers are free from pollution caused due to sewage, domestic waste and industrial effluents,” he adds. “Successive governments at the Centre in the past three decades have freely disbursed money for Ganga cleaning. However, they failed to properly implement the plans and link people, particularly those living on the Ganga banks, with these projects. We can link people during fairs such as Kumbh, Ardh Kumbh, Kanwar pilgrimage and numerous annual festivals that are held on the banks of the Ganga,” asserts Bhatt. He says the Gangotri glacier has receded by 40 per cent and if the glaciers continue to melt at the same alarming rate due to decreasing green cover and global warming, we will have to focus on increasing the water level at the first place. But before that, if the Ganga and her tributaries are cleaned, it will lessen the burden on the government and the nodal agencies working for cleaning the sacred river, he adds. Bhatt urges the government to take steps to clean not only the Ganga but also other rivers, as due to mass urbanisation, industrialisation and unplanned civic development, most of them are getting polluted every day. The number of pilgrims bathing and washing clothes using soap and other chemicals, thus polluting the Ganga, has increased manifold. Moreover, the free flow of the Ganga has been curtailed at several places with the coming up of several government and private hydroelectric projects. This could lead to a bigger catastrophe than witnessed in the state in recent years when the river unleashed its raw power with vengeance and fury, says the environmentalist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:40.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
