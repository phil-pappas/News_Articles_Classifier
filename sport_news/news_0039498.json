The bad news? Many \"power\" or \"flow\" classes move so quickly that you forget to practice proper alignment.\nThat's why I created a series of 60-second yoga fixes for Greatist. In this video, I'll tackle warrior I, a power pose that opens your chest, stretches your calves, and strengthens your thighs and ankles. It's one of those basic yoga poses that everyone thinks they know how to do, but there's a lot going on, so listen carefully!\nFix 1: Traditional Ashtanga yoga calls for heel-to-heel alignment, but feel free to take your legs wider apart for more stability.\nFix 2: Make sure your front knee is directly over your ankle and bend as close to a 90-degree angle as possible.\nFix 3: Check that your back foot is at 45 degrees, pressing your heel down.\nFix 4: Take your hands to your hips and press so much into your back heel that it helps square your hips toward the front of the room.\nBrett Larkin teaches vinyasa flow yoga at top San Francisco studios and on her YouTube channel , where thousands of students have studied with her for more than 5 million minutes.
