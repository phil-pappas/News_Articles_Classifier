(AP Photo/Gretchen Ertl) Comments \nPretend for a second that you didn't just read the headline to this article before clicking and answer this simple question: Who leads all of college football in receptions this season? \nGood job! That would be Tajae Sharpe, arguably the best wide receiving in University of Massachusetts football history. \nSharpe, who caught another 13 balls for 156 yards and a touchdown against Bowling Green Saturday, sits atop the national stat sheet with 58 for the season. The No. 2 guy, Western Michigan's Daniel Braverman, has 56 while Josh Doctson is third with 50 catches for TCU. \nConsidering the Minutemen opened the season with a bye week and have only played five games, I'd say that's pretty impressive feat for the senior wideout from New Jersey. \nYardage-wise, Sharpe ranks third in the nation with 692 (138.4/game). His 11.9 yards-per-catch average is somewhat less impressive and is indicative of the possession receiver role he's often played for UMass this year. \nMaybe the big plays will come this week against Kent State. If so, Sharpe could be just a play away from passing Adrian Zullo as the program's all-time leader in yardage: Fan voting is open for the @biletnikoffawrd ! Cast your vote for Tajae Sharpe! http://t.co/Gd6Eu7qJ2n #WinTogether pic.twitter.com/WdP5nIQ5mf — UMass Football (@UMassFootball) October 13, 2015 Tajae Sharpe's at 2,859 career receiving yards. Needs 34 vs. Kent State to pass Adrian Zullo as UMass' all-time leader. #WinTogether — UMass Football (@UMassFootball) October 12, 2015 Tajae Sharpe leads the FBS in receptions per game (11.6) and is No. 3 nationally in yards per game (138.4). #WinTogether \n[ UMASS QUIZ: How many of the Minutemen's recent football wins can you remember? ] \nFor his career, Sharpe has 224 receptions for 2,859 yards and 13 touchdowns. And that's after playing in an offense that was, uhh, less than efficient moving the ball and scoring points for his first two season. \nIt's also kind of strange to see that someone as good as Sharpe has only scored 13 times in his career. UMass could use a few more of those in the coming weeks. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:22:39.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
