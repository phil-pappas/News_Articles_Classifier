(AP) â€” Two weeks ago, Kansas State had won 49 straight games when leading at halftime.\nNow, the Wildcats have lost two in a row.\nTrevone Boykin threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns, the second a 55-yard strike to Josh Doctson with 1:10 left in the game, and second-ranked TCU rallied from a big deficit to beat the Wildcats 52-45 on Saturday night.\n\"We tried to possess the ball last week and lost a two-touchdown lead doing it,\" Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said, referring to a 36-34 loss at Oklahoma State and defending his decision to air it out with a 35-17 lead in the second half Saturday night.\n\"I was proud of our youngsters because they didn't give in,\" Snyder continued. \"We didn't play well enough to win, but I think the way they came back from last week's ballgame (showed) passion, spirit and determination that I hadn't seen this year.\"\nAlong with his prolific passing, Boykin also ran for 124 yards and two scores for the Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12). Aaron Green added 124 yards and two touchdowns rushing, while Doctson had eight catches for 155 yards and two touchdowns.\nNone was bigger than his catch-and-run just 30 seconds after Jack Cantele had connected on a 37-yard field goal for Kansas State (3-2, 0-2) to knot the game 45-all.\n\"If you want to win in this conference, you have to win on the road,\" Boykin said. \"Coming from behind shows the kind of fight we have in this team.\"\nJoe Hubener ran for 111 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Wildcats. But he also threw an interception that was returned 60 yards for a score early in the second half, then fumbled in the final minute, when Kansas State was trying to drive for another tying touchdown.\nCharles Jones finished with 75 yards rushing and two scores for Kansas State.\n\"It's pretty painful to have one of the top teams in the nation on the ropes and not be able to finish,\" Wildcats defensive end Jordan Willis said. \"You can't allow big plays, especially when you have a team that can score quick.\"\nThe Horned Frogs got off to the explosive start they wanted when Green took the opening handoff 86 yards for a touchdown. It was the fourth-longest run in TCU history, and the longest since LaDainian Tomlinson's 89-yard run against UTEP in 2000.\nKansas State marched 64 yards for an answering touchdown, the first of Hubener's scoring runs, before TCU regained the lead on Boykin's 32-yard toss to Doctson in the end zone.\nThe Wildcats refused to be rattled, though.\nHubener calmly led them the other way, twice converting third downs, before scampering in from 17 yards out. And after the Horned Frogs got a field goal from Jaden Oberkrom, Kansas State struck for two more touchdowns: Jones sprinted 28 yards up the middle for the first, and after Elijah Lee picked off Boykin, Hubener sneaked in from a yard out for a 35-17 halftime lead.\nIt was the most points TCU had allowed in a half since 2004.\n\"The first half they kicked our butts, to be honest with you,\" TCU coach Gary Patterson said, adding that his players spent the week laughing and joking in practice. \"I told our guys what it's like to come here and play and they didn't believe me. Now they believe me.\"\nNeeding a spark to silence the third-largest crowd in Kansas State history, the Horned Frogs got it immediately out of the half. Derrick Kindred stepped in front of Hubener's pass and ran untouched for a touchdown, quieting what had been a roaring mob of 53,671 purple-clad fans.\n\"I felt like it brought a spark to our sideline,\" Kindred said. \"It gave us hope.\"\nThe Horned Frogs trimmed the lead to 35-31 on Green's touchdown run, and 42-37 on Boykin's 14-yard run. After forcing a punt, they finally pulled ahead when Boykin took a read-option over the right side and raced untouched 69 yards for a touchdown with 6:07 left in the game.\nThe Wildcats quickly marched the other way, and TCU's defense was again on the ropes. But the drive stalled, and Cantele's 37-yard field goal knotted the game 45-all with 1:52 left.\nPlenty of time for Boykin and Doctson to do their thing.\n\"The options were run, throw it or kick the field goal,\" Snyder said. \"Obviously the field goal was the wrong thing to do. That's one of those choices.\"\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
