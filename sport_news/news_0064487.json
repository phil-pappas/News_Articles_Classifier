(AP) - Officials say an investigation into a circus tent collapse in New Hampshire that killed two spectators has found that there were more people under the tent than were originally estimated.\nAuthorities initially said about 100 people were under the tent at the Lancaster fairgrounds when the storm blew through the area on Aug. 3.\nA 41-year-old father and his 6-year-old daughter from Concord, Vermont, were killed. Fifty others were injured.\nStacey Dubois, of the state fire marshal's office, tells the Caledonian Record that tickets sold to the Walker International Events show allowed one or two adults to bring in children for free, meaning more people were under the tent than initially reported.\nShe says investigators are hoping to soon find out why the tent collapsed.
