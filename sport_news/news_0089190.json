(Note to Barclays Center: The LIRR is a source of frustration, not joy, for most).\nIslanders fans were incensed with the change and took to Twitter to express their frustration. \nThe Islanders were quick to react and switch back to the horn they had used for 43 years at Nassau Coliseum.\n\nOh, yeah, that’s nice!\nHere’s just one example of before-and-after tweet reactions via SI’s Extra Mustard . \nThe new goal horn sounds like they took it from a beat up compact car that was made in the Soviet Union #isles \n— DIF (@hockeyguy0194) September 29, 2015 \nYES YES YES Islanders goal horn is back!!!
