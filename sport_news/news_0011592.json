More than 43,000 pounds of trout will be stocked during the two-week period in 25 streams and nine lakes as indicated in the 2015 Fishing Regulations Summary . Brood trout will make up part of stocking at select locations. \n“Recent rain has resulted in excellent stream flows throughout the state. The higher-than-normal flows should result in good trout dispersal and excellent fishing through the fall and winter months,” said Johansen. “The fall trout stocking also coincides with archery, crossbow, turkey, and multiple small game hunting seasons and provides sportsmen with a variety of outdoor opportunities.” Anglers can call the Fishing Hotline at 304-558-3399 or visit www.wvdnr.gov to find out which streams and lakes have been stocked each day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:45:14.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
