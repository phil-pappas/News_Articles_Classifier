The three players are the only seniors for Morristown West.\n\"I've talked real highly about this senior class,\" Kelley said on Tuesday. \"They are very special to me. They just kind of burst onto the scene as freshmen and sophomores.\"\nHappenstance played a role.\nMcDonald, a senior setter, owns the program's career assists record, churning out 1,959 prior to Thursday's district tournament final against Morristown East. Ashley Burnett set the previous record of 1,863 in 2004.\n\"Both of our setters quit during her sophomore year,\" Kelley said. \"Claire was actually a middle hitter, and she stepped up and said, â€˜I'll take that on.' \"\nCraine emerged as a freshman, playing on the back row before establishing herself as a standout outside hitter. She owns the school record for digs with 1,514. Williams, a middle hitter, didn't start playing volleyball until her sophomore year, but was a quick study.\nShe needed 17 blocks to break Amanda Collins' record of 459, which was set in 2004, and is closing in on the mark for career kills.\n\"The thing about Abbe and Jasmine is they are big-time basketball players,\" Kelley said. \"Really, they are basketball players playing volleyball.\"\nWilliams and Craine helped Morristown West's girls basketball team reach the second round of the Class AAA state tournament last season. As volleyball players, they combined with McDonald in 2014 to lead the program to just its second state sectional berth.\nThe group will vie for a return trip during next week's Region 1-AAA tournament.\n\"Their sophomore year is the only year we have not made it to the regionals during my time as coach,\" Kelley said. \"We were young that year, but we're hoping to make a big bang here. We're hoping to get to the state tournament. That would be a first for Morristown West.\"\nSmith Invited to All-Star Game: Morristown West senior safety Calvin Smith announced on Twitter on Sunday that he has been invited to play in a Blue-Grey All-American Game.\nBlue-Grey Football hosts two All-American games: an East/West matchup at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Dec. 20 and a North/South option at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. on Jan. 9.\nSmith has 30 tackles and two interceptions for Morristown West (6-1) this season.\nHoffman Receives All-American Attire: Farragut senior longsnapper Ben Hoffman received his Under Armour All-American jersey and helmet during a school ceremony on Tuesday.\nHoffman is the first Farragut player to be selected to the Under Amour game, which is set for January 2016 at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla.\nHe earned his invitation after a standout performance in a Kohl's Kicking camp in Wisconsin in July.\nLayton Commits: Christian Academy of Knoxville senior offensive lineman/defensive end committed to Furman last week, choosing the Paladins over William & Mary.\n\"It really came down to the combination of football and academics for him,\" CAK Rusty Bradley said on Thursday. \"They're getting a guy that has unbelievable upside. He just continues to grow, and not only in height and weight. He moves really well for a guy his size.\"\nLayton, who is 6-foot-5 and 246 pounds, has posted 20 tackles, 7.5 tackles for loss, three sacks and blocked a kick for the Warriors.\nMaryville's Ranking: Maryville's football team jumped two spots to No. 24 in the CBS MaxPreps Top 125 Computer Rankings following a 49-10 win over Dobyns-Bennett in Week 7.\nThe Rebels (7-0) are idle this week.\nChris Thomas covers high school sports.
