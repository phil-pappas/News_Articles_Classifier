He also reported seeing a flash of light.\nBelieving someone was trying to break into the home, the man got a gun and fired a single shot, killing his 48-year-old wife.\nNeither the shooter nor victim were immediately identified. The woman had a gunshot wound to her upper body and was pronounced dead at the scene.\nDetectives interviewed her husband but he wasn’t immediately charged, pending further investigation.\n___\nInformation from: San Antonio Express-News, http://www.mysanantonio.com", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1LnK1EE)"], "published": "2015-10-10T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:23:55.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
