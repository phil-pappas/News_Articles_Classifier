Photo: AP Tweet Published: 4:49 PM, October 25, 2015 \nSINGAPORE — The MotoGP title race will go down to the wire after Dani Pedrosa won a dramatic Malaysian Grand Prix today (Oct 25) that could still see championship leader Valentino Rossi disqualified. \nRossi finished third behind title rival and Yamaha team mate Jorge Lorenzo to allow the Spaniard to close within seven points, but the seven-time premier class champion will await the outcome of an official inquiry to see if he keeps his points. \nPrior to the race, Rossi had claimed former champion Marc Marquez ‘would prefer (fellow Spaniard) Lorenzo to win” the championship and the pair took their war of words onto the Sepang International Circuit in stunning fashion. \nThe duo swapped places and touched wheels a number of times until Rossi appeared to slow at a turn, force Marquez wide and then flicked out a knee, which resulted in his rival’s Honda sliding into the gravel. \nRossi said it was a racing incident and regretted his rival had crashed out. \n“I lost a lot of time fighting with Marc and tried to go a little wider on that turn but unfortunately he crashed at that moment,” Rossi said in an interview. \n“It cost us both a chance to fight with Jorge so Valencia will now be difficult,” he added, looking ahead to the season-ending race on Nov 8. \nShould Rossi avoid disqualification he will be on 312 points ahead of the Valencia Grand Prix, seven ahead of Lorenzo with 25 available for victory in Spain. \nThere was more drama on the podium as the pro-Rossi Malaysian crowd booed Lorenzo when he picked up his second-place prize, with the Spaniard storming off immediately after the anthems and not waiting to pose for post-race photographs. \nDouble world champion Lorenzo saud: “We will wait and see what the investigation says as the incident looked a pretty big one.” \nRepsol Honda team principal Livio Suppo said in a televised interview: “For me it’s clear, Valentino kicked the bike of Marc ... but we need to wait until the end of the race before the officials make a decision.” REUTERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:39:54.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
