But at a growing number of hybrid restaurant-butcher shops, diners have the option of leaving not just with doggie bags, but with raw ingredients and a side of inspiration.\nRelated Recipe ENLARGE Jason Varney for The Wall Street Journal Recipe: Country-Style Pork Ribs That’s how it works at Kensington Quarters, in Philadelphia’s Fishtown neighborhood. “As customers walk in,” said executive chef Damon Menapace, “the first thing they see is the butcher shop, with all that meat on display. They have a nice meal, hopefully try some things that they never would have thought to try, and then think to themselves, ‘I could probably do this.’ ”\nBroadening customers’ dining—and cooking—horizons is a natural part of the “whole-animal” style of butchery that most of these new restaurants practice. “With something like pig trotters, it’s a way easier sell if I prepare them,” said John Blevins, co-owner of Clove & Hoof in Oakland, Calif. (using the menu-friendly name for pigs’ feet). But a customer who tries them in Mr. Blevins’s restaurant may thereafter be more inclined to buy them at his butcher’s counter to cook at home.\nENLARGE Kensington Quarters dining room Photo: Jason Varney for The Wall Street Journal ENLARGE Charcuterie at Kensington Quarters Photo: Jason Varney for The Wall Street Journal Less adventurous diners, too, can benefit from the combination of skilled butchery and inventive chefery practiced at these places. At Parts & Labor in Baltimore, one of the big sellers, both in the restaurant and in the shop, is the “cattleman steak,” a craftily rebranded and crowd-pleasing cut taken from just above the knuckle or knee of the steer. And at Clove & Hoof, Mr. Blevins is particularly proud of their cheeseburger, which, like many great restaurant burgers, is made extra succulent thanks to ground beef with a higher fat content than many butchers would dare display. “Otherwise,” he said, “it’s just meatloaf.”\nAt Kensington Quarters, Mr. Menapace revels in the collaborative atmosphere that comes with in-house butchery. “The kitchen’s open, so all morning while we’re prepping, we’re talking back and forth with the butcher shop,” he said. “They’re coming into the kitchen, saying, ‘Can you throw this onto the stove to test it?’ It’s really kind of like a dream for a chef.” And, potentially, a game-changer for a home cook, too.\nChoice Cuts // Top Butcher Shop-Restaurants Around the Country Parts & Labor, Baltimore\nJames Beard award-winning chef Spike Gjerde brings locally raised meat to Charm City, with a full charcuterie program and an ever changing selection of unusual cuts. partsandlaborbutchery.com\nENLARGE Owners John Blevins and Analiesa Gosnell at Clove & Hoof in Oakland, Calif.
