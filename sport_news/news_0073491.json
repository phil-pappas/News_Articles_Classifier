(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones shares his thoughts on Skal Labissiere's eligibility issues. \nI'm Matt Jones and this is Overtime. \nToday was the Kentucky basketball media day and the players and coaches talked about the season. But what's on everybody's mind was the future of Skal Labissiere, and whether or not he'll become eligible. \nNow you're probably hearing a lot in the media about how some are worried about his eligibility and there are some reports the NCAA is investigating. I'm told by virtually every one involved there is nothing to worry about. \nSkal is ultimately going to play and what they're doing is looking into a couple of things from his past. He's one of 50 players throughout the country where this is happening. \nIf you saw John Calipari today, he doesn't even like talking about the subject. It frustrates him that people keep asking about it and he believes the media is part of bringing this up to begin with. \nEither way, I think fans at this point shouldn't worry. Skal is likely to play and when he does, he's going to be one of the best players in the country. Rather than sitting and fretting about whether or not he ends up on the court, think about what happens when he does end up on the court. \nThe Cats are going to have one of the top five teams in the country and another contender for number nine. \nI'm Matt Jones and this is Overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:23:27.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
