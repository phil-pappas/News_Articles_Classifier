An RTI query filed by activist Anil Galgali has revealed that Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis approved the sum for a government employees’ dance troupe to participate in a competition in Bangkok in December. The sum was transferred to Sachivalaya Gymkhana for the contest. Alliance partners Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party called to question the government’s priorities. \"It attaches more importance to dance than drought,\" Maharashtra Congress General Secretary Sanjay Dutt, while NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik claimed that the state government \"has no funds to help cancer and heart patients, was very prompt in giving money for the dance troupe's visit to Thailand\". The Chief Minister’s Office, however, denied any wrongdoing. Registered in 1967 with the charity commissioner, the CM's relief fund can be used for funding cultural activities, the Chief Minister’s Office said, amid mounting criticism of the move. The Gymkhana had sought aid to send its 15-member team of government employees to enable them to participate in a dance competition in Bangkok from December 26-30. The fifth Cultural Olympiad of Performing Arts 2015 will be held in Bangkok by Global Council of Art and Culture. In 2008, former CIC Shailesh Gandhi had revealed through RTI that public money collected between 2003 and 2005, when the Congress-NCP regime was in power, went to the organisers of a kabaddi competition, a women's football match, a ghazal contest, a Marathi actor's fan club and a Congress MLA's religious congregation. \"The disbursement of the fund is made at the discretion of the Chief Minister, and in accordance with the Chief Ministers directions,\" said the official. The official from CMO said the funds were granted for government employees and were not for any commercial performance. However, RTI activist Galgali claimed the Chief Minister flouted rules. \"The common man from all walks of life are chipping in their best to the CM Relief Fund so as to enable the CM and the government to provide maximum relief to the population hit by the calamity,\" he said. The Public Information Officer (PIO) of the CM Relief Fund Desk, in response to the RTI query, informed Galgali that the Sachivalya Gymkhana had asked for assistance from the Relief Fund through a letter on August 25. On August 27, the application was put up before Fadnavis as a special case. The chief minister promptly sanctioned the sum, which was transferred to Sachivalaya Gymkhana (which the chief minister heads) on September 11, 2015. The dance troupe is slated to participate in the competition being held at Akshara theatre in Bangkok, which is organised by private bodies like Akhil Bhartiya Sanskrutik Sangh and the Global Council of Art and Culture comprising 15 artists for which Rs 50,000 each has been sanctioned totalling Rs 7,50,000. Another Rs 50,000 has been additionally sanctioned to cover other miscellaneous expenses during the trip taking the overall total to Rs 8 lakh. A PIL is pending before the Mumbai High Court against the ad hoc functioning of the CM Relief Fund, due to which the government had taken a policy decision to keep on hold the applications of personal nature and also of Institutions seeking assistance. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:16:06.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
