Utah with another prove-we-belong as a playoff contender and a pair of Big Ten teams exceeding expectations and trying to work their way into the playoff conversation.\nMORE: New No. 1 in Week 6 SN Top 20 | LINEMAKERS: Opening-line report for Week 6\nSeveral other teams have key games, too: How does Clemson bounce back from its emotional win vs. Notre Dame last week with a home game against Georgia Tech?

LSU is the better team and should win, but the Tigers don’t pass well enough to put this one away easily.\nIsner: USC plays inspired even though everything is going against them in this one. They'll keep it close enough to give LSU a scare.\nMORE: This week's SEC Power Rankings\nOklahoma vs. Texas\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, noon\nTV: ESPN\nThe line: Oklahoma (-16.5)\nBender: Oklahoma 45-24\nBradley: Oklahoma 48-23\nBrewer: Oklahoma 35-20\nGriffith: Oklahoma 38-27\nHayes: Oklahoma 34-17\nIsner: Oklahoma 34-20\nJones: Oklahoma 34-20\nWhat we're saying\nBender: It’s on the Longhorns to make it a game. Texas ranks 118th against the pass, and that’s why this one could get ugly. Look for Oklahoma to pour it on in the second half. Baker Mayfield has at least three TD passes in every game so far. He’ll tack on at least three more here.\nMORE: This week's Big 12 Power Rankings\nGeorgia Tech at Clemson\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m.\nTV: ABC\nThe line: Clemson (-7)\nBender: Clemson 31-28\nBradley: Clemson 40-37\nBrewer: Clemson 38-28\nGriffith: Clemson 34-24\nHayes: Clemson 23-17\nIsner: Georgia Tech 31-24\nJones: Clemson 27-24\nWhat we're saying\nBender: It’s the classic trap game for Clemson after an emotional win against Notre Dame. Paul Johnson is 5-3 against the Tigers, but that includes just one win at Death Valley. Clemson — with a healthy Deshaun Watson this time — escapes again in the fourth quarter.\nGriffith: Data shows Clemson had the eighth-best home field advantage among Power 5 teams in league play from 1989-2014 — considerably better than the other Death Valley (4.2 points to 0.54, true advantage). Clemson’s Tigers also have a revenge factor Saturday, having lost to Tech last year, 28-6.\nIsner: The term Clemsoning will be reinvigorated after this week. I sense an emotional letdown after the huge ND win. Georgia Tech will chew up yards at will and pull of the day's second big upset.\nMORE: This week's ACC Power Rankings\nNavy at Notre Dame\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m.\nTV: NBC\nThe line: Notre Dame (-14)\nBender: Notre Dame 37-28\nBradley: Notre Dame 40-24\nBrewer: Notre Dame 42-20\nGriffith: Notre Dame 37-20\nHayes: Notre Dame 33-16\nIsner: Notre Dame 28-24\nJones: Notre Dame 31-20\nWhat we're saying\nHayes: It's important for ND to bounce back in a series they've controlled of late, and critical for Deshone Kizer to become a valuable and trusted thrower and leader with two huge games still on the horizon (USC, Stanford).\nGriffith: The Irish come home after a heartbreaking loss at Clemson, the sort that challenges a team’s mettle. Unbeaten Navy will get Notre Dame’s attention. Coach Brian Kelly’s Irish know what to expect from the Midshipmen; the teams meet for an 89th straight year. Familiarity is a good thing against the option.\nMORE: Week 6 Bowl Projections\nNorthwestern at Michigan\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m.\nTV: Big Ten Network\nThe line: Michigan (-7)\nBender: Michigan 19-16\nBradley: Michigan 10-6\nBrewer: Michigan 24-14\nGriffith: Michigan 24-14\nHayes: Michigan 19-9\nIsner: Michigan 34-14\nJones: Michigan 30-27\nWhat we're saying\nBender: The nation’s top two scoring defenses meet in a classic Big Ten head-banger, and it will be interesting to see what wrinkles both teams install in the game plan. A trick play or two could be the game-defining play. Michigan has won the last four meetings despite either trailing or being tied at halftime each time. Tune in to the fourth quarter. It could come down to a last-second field goal.\nGriffith: It’s not about the size of the crowd, it’s not about the winged helmets or one team being the winningest in college football history. No, the reason Michigan will beat Northwestern is because the Wolverines are the more talented of the two teams. Got to love it when it’s that simple.\nMORE: The worst loss for every Big Ten team\nBoise State at Colorado State\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 7 p.m.\nTV: CBSSN\nThe line: Boise State (-15)\nBender: Boise State 38-24\nBradley: Boise State 35-27\nBrewer: Boise State 49-24\nGriffith: Boise State 30-17\nHayes: Boise State 41-21\nIsner: Boise State 34-20\nJones: Boise State 47-31\nWhat we're saying\nBender: If not for Tanner Mangum, then we’d be having that same-old conversation about Boise State. Brett Rypien has completed 73.9 percent of his passes with six TDs and no interceptions since stepping up for Ryan Finley. The Rams have a good pass defense which keeps it close, but Boise State keeps rolling.\nPLAYOFF CHASE: Four teams in, four out\nArkansas at Alabama\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 7 p.m.\nTV: ESPN\nThe line: Alabama (-16)\nBender: Alabama 31-17\nBradley: Alabama 38-14\nBrewer: Alabama 42-17\nGriffith: Alabama 30-13\nHayes: Alabama 27-23\nIsner: Alabama 42-17\nJones: Alabama 34-20\nWhat we're saying\nHayes: QB Jake Coker still isn't scaring any defenses, but he's not making big mistakes either. If the Tide can stop the Arkansas run game and give Coker and the offense shorter drive fields, the odds of winning increase significantly.\nMORE: Every contender's case for/against being No. 1\nFlorida at Missouri\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 7:30 p.m.\nTV: SEC Network\nThe line: Florida (-4.5)\nBender: Florida 28-20\nBradley: Florida 21-10\nBrewer: Florida 27-20\nGriffith: Florida 30-27\nHayes: Florida 23-20\nIsner: Florida 27-24\nJones: Missouri 24-21\nWhat we're saying\nHayes: After two years of everything going wrong under Will Muschamp, Florida is beginning to win - and just as important - good things are happening in critical moments. Now the Gators must learn how to deal with success, and that begins with playing strong defense on the road.\nBrewer: Following our huge victory on Saturday, this could be a classic trap game with LSU coming up the following weekend. It will really test my Gators’ focus on the road, but I think we show our quality in the second half. It will be close, but we will win this.\nJones: I am not changing what is working for my Gators - keep picking against them to keep them winning! Worried about a letdown from Mac’s boys, but I am liking what I see.\nMORE: Which conference is nation's best?\nMiami at FSU\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 8 p.m.\nTV: ABC\nThe line: FSU (-9.5)\nBender: FSU 27-21\nBradley: FSU 30-27\nBrewer: Miami 24-21\nGriffith: FSU 24-17\nHayes: FSU 30-26\nIsner: FSU 27-20\nJones: FSU 24-13\nWhat we're saying\nHayes: FSU needs a healthy TB Dalvin Cook, if for no other reason, the 'Noles have struggled offensively all season -- and Cook has been the only constant. One of the rare cases where best quarterback (Brad Kaaya) doesn't win.\nBrewer: This is my bold pick. Miami has not defeated FSU in a long time, but I think it finally ends this weekend. FSU is unbeaten, but not as strong as last year. I think this is game where young Miami QB Brad Kaaya really steps up on the big stage and makes himself into a household name.\nMORE: AP Top 25 Week 6\nCal at Utah\n© Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 10 p.m.\nTV: ESPN\nThe line: Utah (-7)\nBender: Utah 38-34\nBradley: Utah 34-24\nBrewer: Utah 31-28\nGriffith: Utah 30-23\nHayes: Utah 35-24\nIsner: Utah 38-21\nJones: Utah 34-24\nWhat we're saying\nHayes: A big moment for Utah, which usually plays really well in these big games at Rice-Eccles Stadium. They're smart on offense, and they're aggressive on defense and the dictate tempo on both sides of the ball. Cal QB Jared Goff has not faced a pass rush like he'll see from Utah.\nMORE: This week's Pac-12 Power Rankings\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TheCoreyBrewer", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-10-04/college-football-playoff-four-baylor-utah-lsu-michigan-state-ohio-state-texas-am", "https://twitter.com/RealCJ10", "https://twitter.com/KenBradleySN", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656179-week-4-college-football-picks-line-florida-tennessee-arizona-ucla-tcu-texas-tech", "https://twitter.com/JohnIsner", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656869-week-5-college-football-picks-line-alabama-underdog-georgia-notre-dame-clemson", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657336-power-5-conference-rankings-week-6-sec-big-12-pac-12-acc-big-ten", "https://twitter.com/BillBender92", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/list/4657314-college-football-betting-lines-odds-week-6-spreads-vegas-michigan-northwestern", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4654824-week-2-college-football-picks-line-michigan-state-oregon-oklahoma-tennessee/slide/353568", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4654194-week-1-college-football-picks-spread-michigan-alabama-auburn-notre-dame-texas", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657119-who-is-best-team-in-college-football-ohio-state-lsu-baylor-tcu-michigan-state", "https://twitter.com/MikeGriffith32", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-10-05/week-6-bowl-projections-college-football-playoff-lsu-tcu-ohio-state-clemson-utah", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657335-sec-conference-week-6-rankings-lsu-texas-am-florida-ole-miss-alabama", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657164-ap-poll-top-25-ohio-state-alabama-florida-michigan-state-utah-tcu-", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4655534-week-3-college-football-picks-line-alabama-ole-miss-notre-dame-georgia-tech", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657331-big-12-conference-power-rankings-week-6-baylor-tcu-oklahoma-oklahoma-state", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657337-acc-conference-week-6-power-rankings-duke-north-carolina-best-team-coastal-division", "https://twitter.com/Matt_HayesSN", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/article/4657390-odds-to-win-college-football-championship-2015-2016-michigan-st-ohio-state-baylor-florida", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657326-big-ten-worst-losses-ohio-state-michigan-penn-state-appalachian-state?iadid=HOME%20PAGEFront_List_2", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657255-college-football-rankings-power-poll-week-6-baylor-ohio-state-tcu-lsu-michigan-state", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657333-pac-12-week-6-rankings-utah-stanford-ucla-usc-cal"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:30:57.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
