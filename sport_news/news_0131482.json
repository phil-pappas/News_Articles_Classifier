(AP Photo) Comments \nFor the first time during the 2015 MLB postseason, Houston Astros outfielder Colby Rasmus did not hit a home run in Sunday's American League Division Series game against the Kansas City Royals. He hit the roof instead. \nOn Monday, the former Russell County High School star hit another homer â€“ his fourth in five postseason games. \nIn the bottom of the seventh inning on Monday, Rasmus followed a home run by shortstop Carlos Correa by pulling a pitch from Kansas City relief Ryan Madson over the right-field fence. It marked the first time that Houston players hit back-to-back home runs in a postseason game and gave the Astros a 6-2 lead in the fourth game of the series. A victory in the game will send Houston to the American League Championship Series. \nRELATED: ROBO SLUG?

On Thursday night, Rasmus hammered another homer as the Astros defeated the Royals 5-2 in the opener of the best-of-five AL Division Series. \nRasmus hit a solo home run on Friday in the Astros' 5-4 loss to the Royals. Rasmus also doubled in that game to become the first player in MLB history to have an extra-base hit in each of the first six postseason games of his career. \nOn Sunday in the Astros' 4-2 victory, Rasmus drew three walks and singled. The base-hit struck the top of Minute Maid Park, an enclosed ballpark, and dropped into right field for a single. The roof is 242 feet high .
