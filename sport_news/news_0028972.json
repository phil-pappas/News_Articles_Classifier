When I took over Japan I wanted to bring pride back in the national team and I think we have done that so it is someone else’s turn to take it over.” \n“Before this tournament, Japan were one of the joke teams. People put out B teams against them and win by 80 points,” he added. \n“So to win three of four games shows the quality of players we have, and how hard we’ve worked to achieve this. \nThat pride was replicated back in Japan with a phenomenal spike in the TV ratings to 25 million for the Brave Blossoms’ two matches after the win over the Springboks. \n“Maybe tonight, there were 30 million people watching in Japan – that’s the whole of the Australian population, plus the kangaroo population, New Zealand and all the sheep,” said Jones. \n“It’s a fantastic opportunity for Japan to have a new generation of players, fans and heroes. \n“They (players) have changed the image of Japanese rugby. When you have heroes, kids want to emulate heroes. This isn’t just about rugby. This is what sport can do. It can inspire kids, instead of playing baseball or soccer, to play rugby now.” \nJones is upbeat about the momentum continuing given the current squad has a solid slice of young players. \n“Probably 60 per cent of this squad can go to the next World Cup, so the guy who takes over is going to have a good squad to work with,” Jones added. \nJapan supporters among the 14,517-strong crowd wore kimonos, while some US visitors were dressed head to toe in Elvis Presley jumpsuits. One Japan fan had his body painted with a message thanking Jones. \nThe winning points came from Kotaro Matsushima, Yoshikazu Fujita and Amanaki Mafi tries, and the reliable kicking of fullback Ayumu Goromaru, who took his Test points haul beyond 700. \nFor the US, their points came through tries to winger Takudzwa Ngwenya and fullback Chris Wyles while fly-half Alan MacGinty added a conversion and two penalties. \nAs his teammates walked around the stadium to chants of “Nippon, Nippon,” Goromaru was overcome with emotion while receiving his second man-of-the-match award at the tournament. \nPerhaps it’s World Cup organisers who should cry at Japan’s exit.
