If the pattern continues, Utah State will have Saturday’s game in the bag.\nBack in 2013, the Aggies captured a 13-0 victory over Colorado State before the Rams took their turn last year with a tight 16-13 win.\nIn 2011, Colorado State topped Utah State in double overtime, 35-34. The Aggies bounced back the following year with a 31-19 win over the Rams.\n“(They’re) a team that we know a decent amount about personnel-wise. We have a lot of respect of them in the games we’ve played against them,” head coach Matt Wells said during Monday's press conference. “They’ve all gone down to the wire.”\nWith the combination of the Aggies’ first home game in exactly a month, their homecoming whiteout game and first Mountain West Conference battle, and sophomore Kent Myers at starting quarterback to lead USU’s offensive, there’s a lot of hype heading into Saturday’s Colorado State matchup.\n“It will be tough challenge. I’m excited to be at home again. It feels like it has been forever. Shoot, it’s been a month,” Wells said. “It should be a great atmosphere. I look for our guys to be really energetic, have a lot of juice, and be ready to go.\"\nSince Chuckie Keeton sprained his right knee against the Washington Huskies, all eyes have been on Myers. Fortunately, the Aggies have nothing but confidence in Saturday’s starting QB.\n“His teammates are very, very confident in him. He brings athleticism and he throws the ball well whether it’s down the field, in the pocket or on the move,” Wells said of Myers. “He’s improved from last year, but game time will tell. I like where he’s at.”", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:40:21.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
