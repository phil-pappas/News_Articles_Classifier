We believe it sank in the last known position that we recorded on Thursday,” said U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Mark Fedor during a televised televised news conference in Florida. “We are still looking for survivors or any signs of life, any signs of that vessel. We’re still doing that. The search for survivors continues.”\nThe El Faro departed from Jacksonville, Fla., on Tuesday when Joaquin was still a tropical storm. The ship was heading to Puerto Rico on a regular cargo supply run. It was being battered by winds of more than 130 mph and waves of up to 30 feet.\nThe ship, the 790-foot El Faro, has not been heard from since it lost power Thursday, when the crew reported they were taking in water from the choppy sea churned by Hurricane Joaquin. The crew is made up of 28 Americans and five Polish nationals. Media reports indicate several aboard were from New England including at least four from Maine.\nFedor said yesterday was the first day the Coast Guard had “favorable” search conditions and they did find a life suit – meant to prevent hypothermia — with human remains believed to be from the El Faro.\n“In one of the survival suits we did identify human remains,” he said. “We lowered a rescue swimmer to confirm that the person was deceased and was basically unidentifiable. We needed to move from there quickly because there were other reports of survival suits, as well as life boats and life rafts. And we checked those methodically throughout the day. No other signs of life at this time.”\nFedor said a life boat was found but had no signs of life on it.\nHe said anyone who was able to abandon ship on Thursday would have encountered difficult category 4 hurricane conditions.\n“If the vessel did sink on Thursday and that crew was able to abandon ship, they would have been abandoning ship in a category 4 hurricane,\" he said. \"So you’re talking up to 140 mile per hour winds, seas upwards of 50 feet, visibility basically at zero. Those are challenging conditions to survive.”\nThe search for survivors continues today with a “full schedule of aircraft,” Fedor said.\nFrancis X McDonald, president of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said the school community is praying for Griffin, a Winthrop native and 2005 graduate of the academy.\n\"We remain hopeful that Keith and the entire crew of the El Faro will be found safe,\" McDonald said in a statement. \"In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers go out to Keith's family and to the families of all the mariners on board. During this difficult time, we want them to know that Massachusetts Maritime Academy and the entire maritime community stands by them while this search continues.\"\nKatie Griffin said she and her husband last communicated through email on Wednesday. “We just talked about our day and he was getting ready to go bed and that he probably wouldn't get much sleep because it was stormy out.”\nShe said her husband's career as a sailor has taken him across the world including Egypt and South Korea. She always knew the perils of the job but worried more about her husband flying than when he was at sea.\nThe hurricane has changed that.\n\"You can have all the training in the world,\" she said. \"But you have a ship dead in the water and Mother Nature, you can't really go up against it.”\nGriffin said she was waiting for her husband of two years to return home later this month before they learned together the gender of their unborn children.\n“He was going to be there,\" she said through tears. \"I'm tired of getting excited about the little good news and then getting let down -- losing all hope.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:36:50.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
