They haven't come close to the playoffs with a record of 48-116. They've had injuries to key players, but mostly have just been devoid of talent.\nThe man taking the heat for most of the team's problems is Jim Buss, the executive vice president of basketball operations.\nPossibly his biggest critic is Magic Johnson, who led the Lakers to five NBA championships in the 1980s.\nJohnson blasted Buss over the hiring of Mike D'Antoni in 2012 instead of former coach Phil Jackson. He went on several TV and radio shows ripping Buss, saying he wouldn't be able to bring the Lakers back to relevance.\nBuss addressed the criticism with USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick .\nUSA TODAY\nBeing Jim Buss\n\"Magic Johnson going nuts on me?\" Buss said with a laugh. \"It’s like, ‘Really, dude? My dad made you a billionaire almost. Really? Where are you coming from?' \"\nJohnson — who sold his share of the Lakers in 2010 and two years later led the ownership group that paid $2 billion for the Los Angeles Dodgers — earned approximately $43 million during his playing days and has been wildly successful in the business sector ever since (a 2011 Forbes report estimated his net worth at $525 million). In the grander sense, though, it's well-chronicled that late owner Jerry Buss' impact on Johnson went well beyond basketball.\n\"Dr. Buss gave me the platform to be Magic,\" Johnson told the Los Angeles Times in Feb. 2013 after Buss' death. \"He gave me the knowledge to be Magic.\"\nWhen asked about Buss’ comment, Johnson issued a statement to USA TODAY Sports in response.\n\"It’s all about winning, Jim,\" Johnson said.\nUSA TODAY\nLakers have high hopes for Kobe Bryant", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2015/10/19/jim-buss-lakers-jerry-west-kobe-bryant-magic-johnson-jeanie-buss/73989030/", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/nba/lakers/2015/10/05/73421898/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4534573087001_kobe-480.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aad54010e24413bc4b5582c84d4cbcb9f86c2b3a/c=0-82-2999-1776&r=x1128&c=2000x1125/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808854634215143-XXX-NBA--Steve-Nash-press-conference-7572.1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:55:11.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
