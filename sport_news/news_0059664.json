O'Hare is generally last in the rankings for on-time performance.\nWith the $516 million runway on the airport's southern edge, O'Hare now has five of its six planned parallel runways.\nDePaul University aviation expert Joseph Schwieterman says the progress puts to rest fears that O'Hare would be unable to handle future growth in the number of flights.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:15:24.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
