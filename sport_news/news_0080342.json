Set up in 1966, the IGMC known as Snowdon Hospital earlier, today stands as a well established centre of research and quality health services, fully equipped with modern tools and machinery. It was a matter of great honour for any institution to complete 50 years of its existence, he said. He said the new projects in pipeline to strengthen the hospital were construction of new multi-storeyed OPD block near Auckland Tunnel, a super-specialty block and a new block of Kamla Nehru Hospital. Much has been done to provide the latest equipment and advanced technology to the hospital, said the Chief Minister. The hospital was having CT scan and MRI facilities, modern cath labs, virology labs, digital radiography, etc. The hospital was linked with All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, and PGIMER, Chandigarh, through tele and video conferencing for valuable inputs, consultation and research in the field of medical science. “I am happy to know that more than 100 post graduate specialists pass out from the college every year,” he added. The Chief Minister said it was decided in the Cabinet on Monday that both the IGMC and Dr Rajinder Prasad Medical Government College and Hospital at Tanda in Kangra would have a separate emergency medicine departments. A separate State Hospital of Mother and Child was coming up in the campus of Kamla Nehru Hospital which would be a part of the IGMC. The Chief Minister said the state government was committed to strengthen health infrastructure in rural areas so that quality health services could be provided to the people at their door-steps. Steps were being taken to fill all the vacancies in far-flung and rural areas. More health institutions were being opened or upgraded in these areas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:52:14.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
