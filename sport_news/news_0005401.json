Hope LaMarcus can keep up.\nTo keep up with all the Spurs teasers and commercials, check out www.heb.com/spurs .\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRmoyle\n ", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752823/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/44/8747283/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752815/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752819/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/12/8655539/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/27/8746468/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Cskui4jG84", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752820/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752816/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752818/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/44/8747283/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752819/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/12/8655537/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/36/8771494/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752820/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752815/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.heb.com/static-page/article-template/spurs-commercials", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/12/8655536/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/12/8655537/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/36/8771494/9/920x920.jpg", "https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752818/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752816/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/12/8655539/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/36/8771497/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/36/8771497/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/27/8746468/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752822/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/12/8655536/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752823/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752817/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752817/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752822/5/920x920.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHBumy3jBNc"], "published": "2015-10-26T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:46:53.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
