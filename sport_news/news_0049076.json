He played in only 28 snaps against the Panthers after having a meeting with Sean Payton about his play vs. the Buccaneers.\n\"Well rotating a defense lineman is pretty common. Now if he felt like he was benched then hey, but after we did that we had pretty good production defensively, in fact very good,\" Saints coach Sean Payton said a few days after the loss to the Buccaneers.\nHicks was in the locker room around 3 p.m. on Wednesday, shortly before the trade happened.\nThe Saints freed up cap space on Wednesday morning by turning a portion of Drew Brees base salary into a signing bonus , allowing some flexibility to make a move.\nHoomanawanui is in his sixth season and has 40 career catches for 518 yards and four touchdowns. He played in two games for the Patriots this season but was inactive last week.\nIn a 2013 game against the Saints, he had four catches for 57 yards.\nPayton was asked on Wednesday morning if the Saints were still looking for ways to improve the roster and specifically mentioned the tight end position. Hoomanawanui will be the third tight end on the roster next to Ben Watson and Josh Hill.\n\"Yes, I think you're still constantly paying attention to the areas, you know were still short at tight end and that's an area that concerns me,\" Payton said. \"With regards to typically, we've always had three with one fullback, but there have been weeks where we may dress an extra fullback, but we're right there that's an area we've looked at and will continue to do so, but yeah I think that process doesn't stop.\"\nHicks, a 2012 third round draft pick out of Regina, was in the final year of his rookie contract and was set to become an unrestricted free agent in the offseason. He was the last remaining member of the 2012 draft class.\nHicks started a total of 33 games for the Saints, with 6.5 sacks and 69 total tackles. His best season was in 2013, when he had 4.5 sacks.\nThe Boston Globe first reported the news.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BenVolin/status/649341448811364352"], "published": "2015-10-01T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:25:12.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
