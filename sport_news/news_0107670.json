Tendulkar at 16 was a free strokeplayer, clubbing the ball as he thought fit. The pressure of expectations tamed Tendulkar. In the early 1990s, still a teenager and yet the best batsman of the team, he had to temper his aggression. He began to slow down perceptibly when nearing his 100, especially in One-day cricket. This is not an accusation, merely the statement of a verifiable fact; this is a natural trait, and it wasn’t peculiar to Tendulkar. Round figures exert tremendous pressure on most batsmen, across the world. Tendulkar was no exception. Sehwag followed in the footsteps of Tendulkar; he based his game on Tendulkar’s. When the two played together, in same India gear, faces obscured by similar helmets, it was often difficult to tell them apart. Sehwag, it was clear, idolised Tendulkar. Sehwag came close to Tendulkar in the brilliance of his strokes — but in the daring of the spirit, Sehwag easily surpassed Tendulkar. Sehwag remained free to the end of his days in cricket. That was the greatest quality of Sehwag — he didn’t bother if he was out for a zero or a 100. He didn’t worry if the previous ball had been edged to the keeper and dropped. He would repeat the shot if he thought fit. A sort of short-term memory loss in the middle was the bedrock of his fearless game. He didn’t seem to care for records. Thus, batting on 291, he could charge out of his crease to hit a huge six to reach 297 (against South Africa). He reached his first triple century in Multan with a six, moving from 295 to 301. In Melbourne in 2003, he hit a six to move from 189 to 195, and tried to hit another off the next ball, and was out. His fans regretted his missing that double century, or a third triple century, against Sri Lanka in Mumbai. But from his words and attitude, it seemed Sehwag couldn’t care less. Tendulkar in the new millennium was great, but Sehwag was the man who was actually feared. Sehwag was the game-changer who attacked the bowlers and crushed the opposition. Sehwag became the destroyer the Tendulkar of 16 had promised to be. Another remarkable thing set him apart — Sehwag spoke his mind. Conversations with him, in press conferences or interviews, were marked by great candour, sometimes hilarity, because Sehwag spoke exactly what he thought. That’s not the convention in times when sportspersons are media-trained to a ridiculous extent. Sehwag’s fellow greats — Sourav Ganguly, Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Anil Kumble — quit in a blaze of glory, with official BCCI celebrations. They are men of the establishment. Sehwag was an outsider. He was unconventional. He played in his own way and left in his own way — through a statement on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:12:17.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
