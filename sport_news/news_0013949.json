Leading the way once again was Mariah Marowsky as she won the 200-yard free style and 100 free style setting meet records in the process for both races.” \nMarowsky continued her strong freshman season with a 55.95 in the 100 and 2:01.79 in the 200. \nThough the freshman was the only individual winner on the day, Fort still got some points out of its relay teams and senior Bailey Weston. \nWeston earned third place for both the 100 and 200 free style with personal best times in both races. The senior swam a 57.42 in the 100 and a 2:03.90 in the 200. \nDevon Oliver and Molly Bare joined Marowsky and Weston for the 200 free relay, taking a third place finish with a time of 1:51.32. \nBare, Weston and Marowsky also took a second place finish in the 150 free relay, which took place instead of the 400-yard, clocking in at 1:21.29. \nThe Blackhawks will return home on Tuesday, hosting McFarland at 6 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:09:24.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
