Jurgen Klopp has told the Liverpool owners that he does want the job but those finer details could still hold things up. \n\"There has been no definite hold-up, but we do know that Jurgen Klopp has been booked into accommodation here for the next two nights. \n\"Both parties will be hoping those finer details can be sorted out in the next few hours - we're not necessarily expecting an announcement today, but Liverpool are edging closer.\" \nRodgers was sacked on Sunday following the 1-1 draw at Everton.
