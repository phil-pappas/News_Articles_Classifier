Obviously, we have great respect for Utah State because they're playing really well. What they did to Boise State last week was pretty impressive, so we know it's going to be quite a challenge.”\nSDSU head coach Rocky Long\nLOGAN – A week after both teams won key showdowns in their own divisions, Utah State and San Diego State will face off in what might be the biggest interdivisional game of the Mountain West season.\nThe Aggies (3-0 in the Mountain West, 4-2 overall) and Aztecs (3-0, 4-3) are slated to get underway at 8:30 p.m. Friday at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.\n\"I think our team is pretty excited about Friday night,\" SDSU head coach Rocky Long declared. \"Obviously, we have great respect for Utah State because they're playing really well. What they did to Boise State last week was pretty impressive, so we know it's going to be quite a challenge.\n\"But again, it's going to be an opportunity too. We've been playing pretty well the last three weeks, as well, so it should be a good game.\"\nWhile San Diego State is coming off of a 30-7 road rout of San Jose State last Saturday that put the Aztecs firmly in first place in the Western Division, the Aggies are still basking in the afterglow of a 52-26 dismantling of Boise State on Oct. 16 at Maverik Stadium.\nThanks in a large part to seven turnovers, Utah State led the heavily favored Broncos, 45-10, at halftime. The Aggies now lead the nation in fumbles recovered with 10, all of them coming in the last four games.\n\"Utah State is good on defense,\" Long replied when asked to explain how USU forced eight turnovers against Boise State. \"I've been in games like that. Sometimes when the avalanche starts, there's no stopping it. And that's kind of what happened in that game.\"\nThanks to their rout of the Mountain West's premier program, the Aggies have started to pick up votes in both national polls. Utah State picked up seven votes in the AP Top 25 to rank 36th, and five votes in the Amway Coaches poll to come in tied for 34th.\nBut while USU head coach Matt Wells said last week's win is \"a performance we're all very proud of,\" he also made it clear that just because the Aggies roughed up the previously ranked Broncos, it doesn't mean they'll be able to push around the Aztecs.\n\"San Diego State has won three in a row, and they have a lot of confidence,\" Wells said. \"They are extremely physical. That's what they brand themselves to be, and that's what they are. It's a staff I have a tremendous amount of respect for. They will be ready to play, there's no question about it.\"\nWells, who served as wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator at New Mexico from 2007-08 when Long was head coach of the Lobos, said SDSU's defense is \"very good  and it's not surprising.\"\nLed by linebacker Calvin Munson, SDSU is third in the Mountain West in rushing defense (93.7 ypg), just behind the Aggies (90.8 ypg). The Aztecs are also second in total defense (296.0 ypg), just ahead of USU (303.3 ypg).\nMunson, a 6-foot-1, 240-pound junior out of Missouri, leads San Diego State in tackles (50) and sacks (7.0) while also recording two interceptions.\n\"He's big-time impressive,\" Wells said. \"Munson and (senior linebacker Jake) Fely are the heart and soul of their defense. Those guys have played a lot of games for Rocky Long, and I know how they're getting coached, which is very aggressively.\"\nOn offense, the Aztecs also boast one of the league's top weapons in Donnel Pumphrey. The junior is currently third in the league in rushing, averaging 104.1 yards per game and 4.6 yards per carry, and also leads SDSU in receiving with 19 receptions for 249 yards and a touchdown.\n\"He is really good,\" Wells said of Pumphrey, who has eight rushing TDs this season. \"We have not played San Diego State yet, but we have seen them on cross tape quite a bit the last couple of years.\"\nSenior Maxwell Smith, a transfer from Kentucky, has taken the majority of snaps at quarterback this season, completing 67 of 132 passes for 967 yards, seven TDs and two interceptions.\nThe Aggies, who haven't played SDSU since joining the Mountain West three years ago, last faced the Aztecs in 2010. USU is 1-10 all-time against San Diego State, the lone victory coming at San Diego in 1967.\nAs is his policy, Wells didn't elaborate on the knee injury that noseguard David Moala suffered in the first half of the BSU game. However, the head coach did state that Moala's injury is not season-ending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:19:47.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
