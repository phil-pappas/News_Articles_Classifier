Links from around the web indicate that fans are fed up with the Cougs after the loss to Cal. By Stefanie Loh Seattle Times staff reporter \nThe Washington State vs. Oregon State homecoming game on Oct. 17 will kick off at 1 p.m. and will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network. \nThe Cougars practiced Sunday night, and Jacob Thorpe of the Spokesman-Review posted some video of defensive coordinator Alex Grinch evaluating how his unit did against Cal. \nGrinch said the defense did better against Cal’s running game than it has against previous opponents in large part because WSU played with more discipline. \n“We’re quick to judge our guys when they show a lack of discipline. Overall you saw a little more of a disciplined defense. That’s what good defenses do, specifically against the run,” Grinch said. “We had two takeaways, three fourth down stops — which were real positive, a shut out in the fourth quarter. I thought we reacted to the adversity pretty well. They were 0-2 in sudden change situations, probably 1-for-3 if you count the onside kick – I don’t think we responded real well there.” Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:33:09.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
