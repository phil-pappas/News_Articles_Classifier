Tate returned to the Cadets lineup after missing three weeks due to a high ankle sprain he suffered in the game. By CHRIS CASEY ccasey @shawmedia.com \nThis football season has looked like an unfamiliar one for Marmion right from the get-go. While the wins and losses have not gone as planned, the 2-4 Cadets have a team of 23 players that take the field every week. \nThis requires many players to not only play offense and defense, but on special teams, as well. \nWhen the numbers are that low, any injuries can prove more costly than normal, which is why Cadets coach Dan Thorpe had his heart drop when starting quarterback Johnny Tate limped off the field in a Week 3 home loss to St. Francis. \nNot only was Tate held out of the rest of that game, but he was diagnosed with a high ankle sprain and was forced to miss the following week’s loss to reigning Class 7A state champion Providence. \n“I felt something in my ankle pop, so I knew something was wrong,” Tate said. “The trainer immediately shut me down. You never want to get injured, but I was fortunate that nothing was broken and I was able to recover in the time that I did.” \nAfter a game with junior Collin Gibson at the helm, the Cadets have their starter back. Tate missed only one game because of a forfeit win in Week 5. Tate would not have been able to play if the Cadets had found an opponent. \nTate, a St. Charles native, returned last Saturday afternoon as Marmion took on Fenwick, and although the Cadets suffered a 42-21 loss, Thorpe saw no after-effects of Tate’s injury. \n“He looked good; he really did,” Thorpe said. “We threw the ball 48 times, if that tells you anything. Johnny’s a hardworking kid and a great leader. I had no doubts he would work hard to get back from the injury.” \nThorpe said Tate’s work ethic goes beyond rehabbing from an ankle injury, but carried over from an offseason where he made the full-time commitment to be Marmion’s quarterback. \nDuring the summer, Tate drove to Chicago for quarterback camps and opportunities to throw and train with other high school signal-callers. Aside from that, Thorpe said Tate would throw four or five days a week to several receivers whenever he could. \nOne of them Nick Funk, who also lives in St. Charles, has been good friends with Tate since middle school, going back to their days playing pee-wee football. \nFunk expected to be a contributor at wide receiver this year before tearing his ACL in 7-on-7 camp this summer. Also a senior, Funk realizes he probably won’t play football again, but he was able to help Tate while he sat out the game he anticipated most on this season’s schedule. \n“The Providence game was one I was looking forward to quite a bit,” Tate said. “Injuries [stink], but they are part of the game. I did everything I could to support the guys that were able to be out there. But there’s no question it was definitely tough for me to not be able to go out there.” \n“I knew what he was going through,” Funk said. “I’ve had to do it every game for these first five we’ve had. I know it’s not fun, and I could tell it hurt him to not be out there. But, it was more important, and I think he knows this, that it was more important for him to get his ankle healthy so he could come back and contribute here at the end of the season.” \nTate came back to throw for 283 yards and a pair of touchdowns against Fenwick, but there was some rust that brought turnovers with it. Thorpe said he expects Tate to be much more sharp tonight after another week of practice. \n“I think it’s hard for anyone, but especially a quarterback to come back after an injury where he had it,” Thorpe said. “He looked mobile and there were definitely a lot of good things he did. As a team, we just haven’t had success in the red zone and can’t finish off drives.” \nTate said any limitations are gone, and his ankle feels “awesome.” \nSeniors such as Tate and Funke always want to leave their mark on a program, and although the Cadets aren’t having the exact season that Tate probably envisioned, he knows there still is time to make an impact. \n“Bottom line now is going out there to prove a point,” Tate said. “We don’t have the biggest guys or the most guys, that’s for sure, but we have the heart. We’ve worked too hard to just give up on the season. We have seen what we are capable of and I worked hard to make sure I could come back and help this team win because they deserve it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:51:27.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
