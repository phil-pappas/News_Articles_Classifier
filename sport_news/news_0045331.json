The points gave Brown’s Raiders a 85.20-84.94 (a difference of 0.26) win over the Second Street Chargers of Democrat editor Glenn Parrish. \nOn Wednesday morning the 2 points for the Seattle defense were deducted because the fumble was not recovered and was merely a possession change. That change gave the win to Parrish’s Chargers, 84.94-83.20. \nOn Thursday morning there was yet another stat correction with Derek Carr being charged with a fumble he was previously not assessed. That cost his owner 2 points. Parrish’s not only owned Carr, but had started him, so he lost two points and the win went back to Brown and the Raiders, making the final score 83.20-82.94. \nHeading into the start of week 5 tonight, there is a lone undefeated team in the league, the Main Street Chiefs of Philip Blankenship. That’s the one projected to win all of two games. \nThere was also a trade in the league today as the River Valley Bengals of Denny Lentz sent Parrish’s Chargers Tom Brady in exchange for Lamar Miller and Joseph Randal. \nLentz’s Bengals and the Fox Road Jaguars of Ryan Chambers are leading their divisions with 3-1 records, which is now the record of Brown’s Raiders, or would have been for Parrish’s Chargers. \nBut since the Chargers are now at .500 they are in a group of four at 2-2, including division foes north_one-oh-niners and the Carefree Cowboys. \nThree teams are 1-3 and only the Brad Street Buccaneers of Brad Schmidt are winless.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:16:19.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
