He's awesome\nIf you haven't seen the story behind the photo above , it's worth the read.\nTo top it off, TCU fans have started a crowdfunding page to help pay for Abby Faber's physical therapy.\n2. Dropping fast food\nBoykin entered this season 20 pounds lighter thanks to ditching fast food. He told Sports Illustrated that he decided to remove it from his diet after the meat in a double cheeseburger \"didn't look right.\"\n\"Animal cruelty, I'm just not a big fan of,\" he told the publication.\n3. Didn't 50 Cent it\nFootball players watch film to study opposing defenses to exploit weaknesses on game day. Boykin also studied film before his first pitch at a Texas Rangers game.\nHe told Fox Sports that he watch 50 Cent's horrible attempt at a first pitch \"about 50 times\" to learn what not to do.\n\"I didn't bounce it and didn't 50 Cent it,\" Boykin told Fox Sports. \"I'm pretty happy with it.\"\n50 Cent, however, did 50 Cent it.\n4. West Mesquite\nWhile at high school at West Mesquite, Boykin saw himself as a safety. He only played quarterback because his coaches saw him throwing a ball with one of his friends . That's right. He only became a quarterback by playing catch.\nHis stats from his junior and senior year proved that the West Mesquite coaches made the right call by putting Boykin at quarterback. According to Rivals, he had 3,046 total yards (1,380 rushing and 1,666 passing) and 37 total touchdowns his junior year. Those totals jumped up to 4,729 yards (1,799 rushing and 2,930 passing) and 58 touchdowns as a senior.\n5. Recruiting rankings\nDespite those eye-popping numbers, Boykin wasn't even ranked in the top 250 players of the 2011 class, according to Rivals. He was a three-star recruit .\nOther notable quarterbacks who finished in front of him were:\nPlayer\nType of recruit\nSchool attended\nOverall Rivals ranking\nJeff Driskel\n4 star\nFlorida\nNo. 32\nBraxton Miller\n4 star\nOhio State\nNo. 34\nCody Kessler\n4 star\nUSC\nNo. 71\nBrett Hundley\n4 star\nUCLA\nNo. 72\nJacoby Brissett\n4 star\nFlorida\nNo. 75\nMax Wittek\n4 star\nUSC\nNo. 76\nJ.W.

He's been making plays for a long time now\n7. He owns two pit bulls\nAdiÃ³s #GrindTime #TCUðŸ¸\nA photo posted by Trevone Boykin (@t2boykin) on Aug 4, 2015 at 7:36am PDT\nHe's got Cookie (on the left), which is short for Cookie Monster, and Taz (right), which is short for Tasmanian Devil.\n8. Wide receiver\nBefore breaking out as a quarterback, Boykin played wide receiver. In 2013, he had 26 receptions for 204 yards. At least one NFL scout thinks that Boykin could return to playing receiver in the NFL.\n\"I think with Boykin it could be a position he's previously played, either wide receiver or running back,\" former NFL scout Bucky Brooks told NFL.com . \"He and Braxton Miller are in the same category, kind of a hybrid. Most people will take those guys and make them receivers, just because the transition is easier. The transition to running back can be a little more challenging in terms of bulking up to run it between the tackles, and being a factor in pass protection. I see him as a guy who could play in the slot, but also be a gadget guy, and someone who can help on special teams.\"\n9. He's in awe of big hits just like fans\n10. Bill Snyder was impressed by him\nI have so much respect for Coach Snyder and his Kansas st football team! #LivingLegend pic.twitter.com/An0ANnJgME\nâ” Trevone BoyKING (@OGcURIOUSDEUCE) October 16, 2015 On Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/59w1_6hneR/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/LivingLegend?src=hash", "http://www.foxsports.com/southwest/story/all-access-with-tcu-quarterback-trevone-boykin-071315", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-yuxF-C4_8", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYH3ZHhnCkU", "http://t.co/An0ANnJgME", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9ZByENupGU", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "https://sports.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/rankings/rank-rivals250/2011", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000550816/article/brooks-wide-receiver-could-be-in-trevone-boykins-future", "https://twitter.com/OGcURIOUSDEUCE/status/655085859633434624", "http://sports.yahoo.com/lsu/football/recruiting/player-Trevone-Boykin-94752", "http://www.campusrush.com/trevone-boykin-sam-ukwuachu-inside-read-1311167343.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:36:05.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
