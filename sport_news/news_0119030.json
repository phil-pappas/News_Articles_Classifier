But a win by A&M (23-4, 5-1) would force a three-way tie between the Raiders, Rams and St. Teresa. \nRork played for Peifer at Shelbyville and also coached for her in Peifer's club program. While Rork has yet to beat Peifer -- she's 0-2 in her first two seasons as Raiders coach -- both matches have been marathons. In 2013, Shelbyville won 25-20, 22-25, 25-23, and last year it was 25-23, 24-26, 29-27. \nBut after the conference matchup, the two coaches can root for each other for awhile. Both are in Class 2A for the postseason, but are in different super-sectionals and wouldn't meet until the state tournament. \nShelbvyille is in the Fairfield Super-sectional and is the top seed at the Toledo Regional, which feeds into a sectional the Rams are hosting. A&M is in the Warrensburg Super-sectional and is the No. 2 seed at the Williamsville Regional. Tennis going two classes \nThe IHSA Board of Directors voted to expand boys and girls tennis to two classes beginning next season. \nThe Board made its vote after reviewing the results of a survey of the IHSA member schools in which 76 percent of the respondents supported adding a second class. \nThe class enrollment break will be determined based on placing the smallest 50 percent of the participating schools in Class A and the remaining half in Class AA. Based on the 2014-15 entries, the classification cutoffs would have been 1378 for girls and 1427 for boys. \nUnder the new two-class format, the state final tournament will have the same total number of qualifiers (128) as it did in the one-class era, with 64 singles and doubles players qualifying in each class. Sectionals will also be split, with the 32 total sectionals that existed in the one-class system becoming 16 Class A sectionals and 16 Class AA sectionals. \nIn the one-class system, an overwhelming majority of singles and doubles players reaching the semifinals were from large Chicago-area schools, with St. Teresa's Kuhle twins -- Tracy and Amy -- the rare exception. The Kuhles finished in the top four in doubles all four years of their high school careers -- no other singles or doubles players from outside Chicago have ever done that. Little giants \nIt's not that Clay City is a complete stranger to volleyball success, but it's been awhile. \nThe Wolves (24-2) won the Midland Trail Conference regular season and tournament titles for the first time since 2007, when the team went 27-2. \nWith 75 students based on last year's enrollment, Clay City is the second-smallest public school in the H&R area (only DeLand-Weldon at 60 is smaller) and the 16th-smallest public school in the state. \nBut Clay City hasn't lost since falling to Class 3A Harrisburg in three sets in the championship of the Flora Tournament on Sept. 21, winning 13 straight heading into next week's regionals. The Wolves only other loss was to Farina South Central on Sept. 10. \nThe Wolves, who are led by Macy and Megan Hance, haven't won a regional title since 1987, but are the top seed at next week's Oblong Regional. Clay City has wins against third-seeded Oblong and fourth-seeded Dieterich, but haven't played second-seeded St. Elmo/Brownstown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:39:22.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
