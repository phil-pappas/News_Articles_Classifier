For voters whose primary concern is to get anyone but Harper elected, they will be looking to which of the Liberal or NDP candidate is the best challenger to the Conservative in that riding.”\nThe Conservatives are still holding on to support through much of the Fraser Valley.\nA recent Forum poll suggested more than a quarter of Canadians are voting for “the party that can defeat the government” (28%), rather than voting for “the party they believe in” (64%).\nRelated Stories Turn Up YVR campaign aims to get young voters to advance polls Two parties emerge as front-runners in federal election A poll of polls: New seat projection tool for the federal election conservatives | federal election | Liberals | NDP | poll | swing", "external_links": ["http://www.threehundredeight.com/"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:01:28.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
