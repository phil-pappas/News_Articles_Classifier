Russia, a top ally of President Bashar al-Assad, started bombing in Syria on September 30 saying it was targeting Islamic State and other opposition groups, a campaign that has drawn Moscow deeper into Syria's more than four-year-old conflict. Rebels on the ground and Western states have said Moscow's air campaign, which has been combined with ground attacks by pro-government forces, have mainly targeted rebel groups not associated with Islamic State, including US-trained fighters. A Russian defence ministry representative said on Saturday Russia had intensified its campaign in the last 24 hours, with 64 sorties hitting 55 targets, Russian news agencies reported. The representative, Major-General Igor Konashenkov, described the targets hit as controlled by Islamic State, also referring to them as belonging to \"militants\" and \"terrorists\". He said they included command and control centres, weapons depots and training bases, located in the Syrian provinces of Raqqa, Hama, Damascus and Aleppo. The first of those provinces is in eastern Syria and the main Islamic State stronghold, while the other three are in Western Syria where the group is typically weak. However, Islamic State militants have been advancing on Aleppo in recent days, seizing villages in the province from rival insurgents. Konashenkov said one of the targets hit near Aleppo was a concealed base for military vehicles, which he said had received a direct hit from an Su-24M bomber. More than ten vehicles had been destroyed, including two tanks and five infantry vehicles, he said in comments cited by Interfax. Chechens\nRussian strikes hit northern areas of Latakia province, the coastal heartland of Assad's Alawite minority sect, as well as northern areas of Hama province further east, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. There was no immediate information on casualties. The Observatory says Islamic State has no real presence in these areas. However, there were other militants in northern Syria, such as Chechens, that Russia might want to attack. Syrian state television said in a newsflash that attacks carried out by government forces in the area had killed and wounded a number of \"terrorists\", a term it uses to describe all insurgents in Syria. The Observatory said a large explosion hit a building on the outskirts of the town of al-Bab in northern Syria, which is held by Islamic State. It was not immediately clear what caused the blast in the building, which Islamic State had used to store explosives, according to the British-based Observatory, which tracks the conflict using sources on the ground. The Observatory also said Syrian government forces backed by militia had captured the village of Atshan from insurgent fighters in Hama province after Russian airstrikes in surrounding areas. Atshan sits to the east of the north-south highway running through major western cities in Syria. Towns and villages around the road have been a focus of Russian air strikes. Syrian state TV also said in a newsflash that the army had captured the village Human Rights Watch said late on Friday that the first Russian air strikes on northern Homs last month killed at least 17 civilians and should be investigated for possible violations of the laws of war. Russian President Vladmir Putin said earlier this month that reports of civilian deaths in Russian air strikes on Syria were an \"information attack\". US, allies conduct 25 air strikes in Syria and Iraq: US military A coalition led by the United States targeted Islamic State in Syria with five air strikes on Friday, and also hit the militant group with 20 bombardments in Iraq, according to a statement released on Saturday. The Combined Joint Task Force said the Syria strikes hit tactical units near Al Hasakah, Ar Raqqah, Manbij, and Mar'a and also destroyed tactical vehicles and a building belonging to Islamic State in those areas. Near Palmyra, a strike destroyed and damaged Islamic State front-end loaders, tractor-like equipment that are used in construction, it said. Four attacks concentrated near Ramadi in Iraq struck two Islamic State tactical units, and also destroyed a preparation area, a front-end loader, a heavy machine gun and six fighting positions. They also \"denied ISIL access to terrain,\" the statement said, using a common acronym for Islamic State. The area near Sultan Abdallah also had heavy bombardment, with three strikes destroying a vehicle-bomb factory and storage facility. â€” Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:21:31.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
