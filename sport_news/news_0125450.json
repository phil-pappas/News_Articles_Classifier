No one has seen the second-grader since she disappeared from her bedroom in Midwest City, OK, in 1997,\nOn Wednesday, just two houses away from that room, investigators search a neighbor’s yard using ground-penetrating radar, even crawling beneath the home to look for the little girl’s remains.\nChief Brandon Clabes of the Midwest City Police said they were “looking for any evidence that might be related to the case. Obviously, it’s 19 years old, so we’re going to be very meticulous with our search and with this process.”\nThe search comes days after prosecutors charged 56-year-old Anthony Palma with first-degree murder and kidnapping. They said new tests showed Palma’s DNA on Kirsten’s window sill and on the 8-year-old girl’s underwear, which was found in her backyard.\nPalma lived just two doors down from the girl in 1997. He still lives there with his own kids and the wife he married in 1999.\nThe Hatfield family moved away.\nPolice said a new investigator assigned to Kirsten’s case realized some of the evidence had never been tested. New DNA technology allowed lab techs to link the case to Palma, who police interviewed twice in 1997 in connection with her disappearance.\nThe search for her remains probably won’t be over anytime soon.\n“They usually go by foot sections in this process, and so if it’s going to be very time-consuming,” Clabes said. “It’s going to take a lot of manpower and a lot of effort to get this search done correctly.”\nCopyright 2015 CNN.
