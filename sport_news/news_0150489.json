Elliott’s 55-yard touchdown with 9 minutes to go in the third gave Ohio State its first lead of the game at 13-10. After IU countered with a touchdown, Elliott took off on a 65-yard score to give the Buckeyes the lead for good. His 75-yard run with just over 10 minutes to play in the fourth quarter capped Ohio State’s scoring and gave the Buckeyes a 34-20 lead. \nElliott’s total ties for the second-most in school history with Keith Byars (274 vs. Illinois in 1984) and trails only the 314-yard game by Eddie George in 1995 vs. Illinois. Elliott’s 243 second-half yards are a school record for a half, topping the 195 yards Byars gained in the second half vs. Illinois. \nLatest Buckeye News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:54:40.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
