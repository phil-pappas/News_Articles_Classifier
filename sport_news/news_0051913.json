If the ball had come out of the vines, or Fowler would’ve reached in for it, the ball would’ve been in play, and Conforto would’ve easily scored. \nMets manager Terry Collins got into a heated argument after the play, though he’s a theatrical sort anyways, a la Lou Piniella back in the day. \n“I know the rule,” Collins said. “We all know what the rule is. My argument was my runner’s halfway to third base, if not three-quarters of the way to third base. If just ask (umpire Ted Barrett). He said I can’t (challenge) it. That’s just the rules. Can’t even challenge it. I wanted him to go to the camera upstairs. But I knew the rule. It’s just (that) it kinda sucks when it happens to you.” \nCollins said he has been around long enough to know “stuff happens in the ivy,” and he wasn’t referring to Kerry Wood pulling Andre Dawson out of the ivy in a TV commercial. \n“It’s what makes the ballpark unique,” he said. “And certainly I was not very happy at the moment.” League Championship Series - New York Mets v Chicago Cubs - Game Three Elsa / Getty Images \nMets manager Terry Collins argues a ground rule double call with home plate umpire Ted Barrett in the sixth inning. \nMets manager Terry Collins argues a ground rule double call with home plate umpire Ted Barrett in the sixth inning.

On Tuesday, the Mets wound up not adding a run that inning, but scored twice in the seventh in a 5-2 win. \nOne of the more memorable ball-eating moments by the Wrigley ivy occurred on June 5 th , 1998, during a Cubs-White Sox interleague game. \nWhite Sox outfielder Magglio Ordonez hit a ball to the right field wall that got swallowed up in the vines. Outfielders Sammy Sosa and Jose Hernandez held their hands up, and plate umpire Charlie Williams ruled it a double, with the runner going back to third. The Cubs won by one run, 6-5, and Sox fans were irate at the perceived injustice. \n“That's part of the mystique of this place,” Cubs infielder Jeff Blauser said afterwards. “It's one of the things that make it special. And No. 2, it would be unfair to make a fielder go in to look for the ball. Let's say he has his back to the wall and the ivy holds the ball and he has no idea where it went in, it would be unfair for him to have an Easter egg hunt while the guys are running the bases. A rule is a rule.” \nWinning pitcher Terry Mulholland theorized a squirrel had run onto the field that morning, jumped into the ivy, hid there through the game, caught the ball and hung on tight. He also added the squirrel was probably the reincarnation of Harry Caray, because that was Terry Mulholland. \n“That's the difference between this year and last year,\" Mulholland said. “Last year that squirrel would have bit somebody.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:57:32.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
