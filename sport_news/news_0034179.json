That situation has changed and that is what brought about his visit there last weekend.\n\"It was great,\" he said. \"It was good to get up there again and see the coaches and my friends and other recruits. The atmosphere was amazing. It was the best recruiting visit I've taken.\"\nNordin, who is ranked as the nation's top kicker by Scout, will be bringing his mother with him to this weekend's game.\nBoth of those will be unofficial visits, but the Wolverines will also have four uncommitted official visitors in the house on Saturday, all coming in with big-time offer lists and press clippings.\nBradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy's Isaac Nauta, the nation's top tight end, will be in town along with three from California -- wide receiver Dylan Crawford and defensive backs David Long and Lamar Jackson.\nSeveral juniors with Michigan offers will attend. St. Joseph (Michigan) BUCK prospect Corey Malone-Hatcher will be back for his third game visit of the season and second in a row. Orchard Lake St. Mary's wide receiver K.J. Hamler, Oak Park offensive tackle Jaraymond Hall and Detroit King's Ambry Thomas are two other in-state four-stars who are part of Michigan's \"Pipeline 9\" expected at the game. Ann Arbor Pioneer running back / linebacker Antjuan Simmons, who has received nearly 20 offers in two weeks, but not yet the Wolverines, will visit as well.\nCovington (Ga.) Newton running back Kurt Taylor will return to campus. He previously visited for the BBQ at the Big House, where he was offered, and then the BYU game.\nIn the younger classes, in-state sophomores Marquan McCall of Oak Park, Antwan Reed, a 6-foot-7 offensive tackle from Muskegon, and Detroit Cass Tech cornerback Kalon Gervin will join Southfield freshman quarterback Sam Johnson and Detroit King freshman linebacker Tyrece Woods. This will be Reed's second game visit this season and he may be in line for a scholarship offer in the near future. McCall already holds an offer from Michigan.\nIsaac Nauta   (Photo: Chad Simmons, Scout.com) \nMore information \nIsaac Nauta profile \nDylan Crawford profile \nAllen Trieu began covering the state of Michigan for Scout.com in 2005 and began managing the entire Midwest in 2009.
