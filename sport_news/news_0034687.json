Davenport completed 6 of 13 passes for 129 yards and 3 touchdowns and added 40 yards and another touchdown on 10 carries as the Warriors took control and never looked back. \n\"The offense was clicking,\" Lamar Coach Josh Jones said. \"We blocked well, and Davenport made some nice throws. We needed him, and he played well. This was a huge win.\" \nLamar running back Dusty Wilkins finished the half with 9 carries for 115 yards with 2 touchdowns and caught a 20-yard touchdown pass. \n\"He is an outstanding football player,\" Jones said of Wilkins. \"Sometimes when you have a lot of good players it's hard to get them all the ball. It's a good problem to have.\" \nBooneville (1-5 0-3) was limited to 35 yards of offense in the first half while Lamar rolled up 334 yards. \n\"This is a huge win for the program,\" Jones said. \"That first-half defense was outstanding. They played so awesome. Booneville has scored some points this season. It's very special to be 6-0.\" \nLamar took advantage of good field possession to take a 7-0 lead with 10:46 left in the first quarter when Davenport found Blake Kern for a 38-yard touchdown. \nBooneville turned over the ball with a fumble on its first drive, and it didn't take Lamar long to take advantage of the opportunity as Wilkins scored on a 24-yard run for a 14-0 lead with 3:34 left in the first quarter. \n\"We couldn't put a drive together early and defensively we made some mistakes,\" Booneville Coach Scott Hyatt said. \"We need to tackle a lot better. Lamar played a good game. They have a lot of skilled players with a good offensive line.\" \nLamar's Austin Hency finished with 63 yards on 6 carries, and Cody Wyatt had 2 catches for 57 yards and 1 touchdown for the Warriors. \nBooneville quarterback Hayden Fennell completed 8 of 13 passes for 75 yards and had 23 yards and 1 touchdown on 5 carries. \nSMACKOVER 54, \nDREW CENTRAL 0 \nMONTICELLO — Smackover (4-2, 3-0 6-3A) recorded its fourth consecutive shutout, beating Drew Central (2-4, 1-2).

Smackover held the Pirates to 23 yards of total offense, and the only two first downs Drew Central had came on penalties. \nKeiandre Purifoy rushed for two touchdowns for Smackover, and Beau Burson threw two touchdown passes. Jordan Jones caught a 22-yard touchdown pass, and Corbin Lee had a 66-yard scoring reception. \nPRESCOTT 42, HORATIO 14 \nPRESCOTT — Trevor Pipkin completed 27 of his 29 passes for 300 yards and 2 touchdowns to help lift Prescott (4-2, 3-0 5-3A) over Horatio (3-3, 0-3). \nMaleric Butler had just two carries for the Curley Wolves, but he tallied 113 yards and scored touchdowns on both carries. Carlos Vanhook also scored 2 touchdowns, carrying 6 times for 89 yards.
