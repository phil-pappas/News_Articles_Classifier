Burgess twins commit future to Souths \nAny speculation George Burgess could join Jarryd Hayne in the NFL has been put to bed after the English prop re-signed with South Sydney on Thursday until the end of the 2018 NRL season. \nBurgess joined his twin brother Tom in committing to the Rabbitohs for three more seasons. \nBoth players were off contract at Redfern at the end of next season, but the club has moved to shore up their long-term playing roster after a disappointing premiership defence this year. \nGeorge Burgess, 23, said earlier this year he was closely watching Hayne’s conversion to American football and only signed a one-year extension with the Rabbitohs in May so he could keep his options open. \nBut he has now pledged his future to the cardinal and myrtle. \n“This club is my home now and I’m happy to have my future sorted,” George Burgess said. \n“We’re building something great at this club and with commitment and dedication we can achieve our goals. \nCoach Michael Maguire welcomed the retention of the England internationals. \n“George and Thomas are two of the pillars of our forward pack and we are very happy to have them extend their time with the club to cover at least the next three seasons,” Maguire said. \n“They are both great athletes and have made a real impact on our forward pack over the past few years. \n“They are both leaders-in-the-making and were happy to have the boys in red and green.” \nThe re-signing of the Burgess brothers continued a busy off season of recruitment and retention for the Rabbitohs. Souths have added Damien Cook, Michael Oldfield and Cameron Murray to their NRL squad for 2016 and also extended the contracts of Kyle Turner, Chris Grevsmuhl and Bryson Goodwin.
