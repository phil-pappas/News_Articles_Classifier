Coaches are always looking for the next best thing. \nSometimes it comes faster than expected. \nVan Ginkel's skills were on display on South Dakota's scout team last season, so Coyotes coach Joe Glenn and his staff got an early preview of his breakout campaign. In five games, Van Ginkel has 9.5 tackles for loss and five sacks among his 26 tackles. The 6-foot-4, 230-pounder also has two quarterback hurries, a fumble recovery, a forced fumble and a blocked kick. \nBut Van Ginkel is far from alone in making an immediate impact this season. There are plenty of freshmen doing just that. \nThe Big Sky Conference, CAA Football and Ohio Valley Conference have some of the deeper freshman classes in the FCS. \nIn the Big Sky, Northern Arizona's Case Cookus is carving his niche in a conference with a rich tradition of quarterbacks. He's second in the FCS in passing efficiency (189.0) and first among FCS freshmen in passing yards per game (235.7). Most impressive, though, are his 15 touchdown passes to two interceptions. \nNorth Dakota's John Santiago leads all freshman running backs with 597 rushing yards - just a half-yard shy of averaging 100 per game - and in all-purpose yards per game (165.5), with six touchdowns. \nAnd don't forget the defense - which sometimes the high-scoring Big Sky does - as Eastern Washington's Alek Kacmarcik is one of the better young linebackers in the nation. \nWithin the CAA, Albany boasts the leading freshman pass catcher in the FCS in Zee Roberson (34 receptions), while Maine's Micah Wright is best among frosh with 434 receiving yards. In addition, Delaware running back Thomas Jefferson has rushed for 514 yards on over six yards per carry and Albany linebacker Julian Cox has a well-balanced statistical line. \nSome of the big play in the OVC is coming from Tennessee State quarterback Oshay Ackerman-Carter , who beat out former all-conference selection Ronald Butler for the No. 1 job, Austin Peay running back Kendall Morris and UT Martin linebacker Kevin Prather Jr . \nAcross the FCS, other freshman standouts include Stephen F. Austin running back Loren Easly , Southern Illinois all-purpose threat Daquan Isom , The Citadel running back Evan McField , Monmouth quarterback Cody Williams, Bethune-Cookman linebacker Trenton Bridges , San Diego quarterback Anthony Lawrence and East Tennessee State linebacker Dylan Weigel, whose 55 tackles lead all freshmen. \nBy November, coaches say first-years are basically no longer freshmen anyway. \nSome just got a quicker start on the maturation. \n---= \nFCS GAME OF THE WEEK= \nThe Matchup: Bethune-Cookman (5-1, 3-0 MEAC) at North Carolina A&T (4-1, 2-0) \nThe Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET at Aggie Stadium in Greensboro, North Carolina \nThe Series: Bethune-Cookman leads, 22-14 (most recent: Bethune-Cookman won 28-12 at home on Oct. 6, 2012) \nThe Skinny: Bethune-Cookman has won at least a share of four of the last five MEAC championships, but North Carolina A&T was chosen as the conference's preseason favorite after being a part of the five-way share of first place last year. Senior quarterback Quentin Williams has stepped up his play running the Bethune offense, playing with both confidence and efficiency. A&T defensive end Angelo Keyes will be keying on Williams, though, so the Aggies need to get big efforts from running backs Anthony Jordan and Michael Jones . Leading tacklers Robert Way , Trenton Bridges and Diquan Richardson have led a rebuilt defense, which returned only two starters from last season. Bethune has yet to solve a penalty problem which has plagued it in recent seasons (the Wildcats are averaging 10 penalties per game). A&T leads the MEAC in total defense (274.6 ypg) and ranks second in scoring defense (20.2 ppg), getting terrific seasons out of Keyes, defensive tackle Marquis Ragland and cornerback Tony McRae . MEAC rushing leader Tarik Cohen (106 yards per game, seven touchdowns) is known for his breakaway speed, but he was a workhorse last Saturday with 36 carries at Norfolk State. Coach Rod Broadway, coming off his 100th career win, might utilize two QBs, Kwashaun Quick and Lamar Raynard . The Aggies are much stronger than Bethune on special teams, especially with their returners. \nThe Prediction: This is one of the more pivotal games as the MEAC gets closer to handing out its Celebration Bowl bid. A&T let an outright conference title slip away last season. This season is about making amends. North Carolina A&T, 26-17. \n---= \nLast Week's Record: 43-15 (.741) \nOverall Record: 336-69 (.830) \n(All Times ET; X-Predicted Winner) \n---= \nX-Alabama State (2-4, 2-3 SWAC) at Arkansas-Pine Bluff (1-4, 0-3), 7:30 p.m. \n---= \nBucknell (3-2) at X-Army West Point (1-5), noon \nX-Princeton (4-0, 1-0 Ivy) at Brown (2-2, 0-1), noon \nDavidson (1-4, 0-2 Pioneer) at X-Butler (3-2, 1-1), noon \nX-Dartmouth (4-0) at Central Connecticut State (2-4), noon \nX-Colgate (2-4, 1-0 Patriot) at Georgetown (3-3, 1-0), noon \nX-No. 13 Richmond (4-1, 2-0 CAA) at Rhode Island (1-5, 1-2), noon - Richmond's version of thunder and lightning are senior running backs Seth Fisher and Jacobi Green .
