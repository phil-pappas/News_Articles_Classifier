(Video / Jeff Bauer) \nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. — Jazz Peavy’s speed was challenged back in the summer of 2013, and the Kenosha native wasn’t the type to back down. \nIt was near the end of practice for the 2013 Wisconsin Football Coaches Association All-Star Classic in July of that year when Peavy took part in a 40-yard race against two teammates to prove his 4.4 speed was the fastest in the southern part of the state. \nHe pulled up 5 yards from the finish. \n“I remember feeling just like a pop, a slight pop, and instantly I knew I couldn’t run,” said Peavy, now a redshirt sophomore for the University of Wisconsin football team. “Just tragic.” \nPeavy still believes he would have redshirted the next season regardless of that injury, but the same hamstring gave him problems the next year, forcing him to miss almost the entirety of fall camp as a redshirt freshman. \nHe thought he was ready to add value to the Badgers’ receiving corps, but didn’t have an opportunity to prove it. Peavy was forced to “take a seat” even after he healed up last season and watch as UW failed to find any consistency at the wide receiver position behind top target Alex Erickson. \nAfter two years of waiting, Peavy has finally started to emerge as an important piece of the passing game. \nHe made a number of key receptions in a close win at Nebraska — including a third-down grab that led to UW’s go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter — and caught a 20-yard pass on third down last week during UW’s opening touchdown drive against Purdue. \n“It’s really satisfying,” Peavy said. “It’s a great feeling to know that I’m contributing to the team. I’ve been putting in the work, and it’s finally all showing. It’s just a really good feeling to finally be back out there playing.” Hidden talent \nJeff and Linda Peavy were laughing hysterically on the sidelines of a Pop Warner football game about 12 years ago. \nThey were cracked up by what they thought was a coincidence involving their son. On the first snap of Jazz Peavy’s organized football career, he was handed the ball and ran the length of the field for a touchdown. \n“The next season, he did the exact same thing again,” Jeff Peavy said. “And that’s when I realized that maybe this kid has a lot of potential. He can grow up to be something special. He just took it from there and ran with it.” \nHis talent hasn’t always presented itself so obviously. \nJazz Peavy played in a run-heavy offense his junior year at Kenosha Tremper and caught just 22 passes for about 400 yards and four touchdowns. \nHe didn’t begin attracting major college attention until the following summer when he impressed at camps in Chicago and Champaign, Illinois, where he and the Badgers are taking on Illinois today. \nPeavy stood out so much during a one-day camp at UW that former coach Bret Bielema offered him a scholarship immediately after its conclusion. \n“He might have been one of the quickest (commitments) ever,” said Kenosha Tremper coach Frank Matrise, who helped work that one-day camp at UW. “We got called up to Coach Bielema’s office, Coach Bielema offered him, and (Peavy) said, ‘Yeah, I’m coming to the University of Wisconsin.’ \n“It was that fast. And he never wavered for one second from that point on.” \nPeavy was set to stay in state and attend his dream school, but it would be more than three years before he caught a pass for the Badgers. \nMatrise said Peavy missed parts of his junior and senior seasons in high school due to injury, and Peavy said he was forced to undergo labrum surgery after his final game. \nHe was paired up with UW wide receiver Jared Abbrederis in Gary Andersen’s “Big Brother” program the next year and learned as much as he could from one of the most productive wideouts in school history. \nWhen Peavy finally got his chance this season, he made sure he was ready. \n“I wouldn’t say it was frustrating,” Peavy said of his first two years at UW. “Maybe just a little self-doubt. I just had to fight through it, and everything got better. Trusting the process and just getting better every day.” Making an impact \nPeavy’s first career catch came on a 14-yard completion in the fourth quarter of UW’s season-opening game against Alabama. It was his only reception of the day. \nWhen he returned to the locker room and looked at his phone, he found a couple dozen text messages along with an overload of Twitter and Facebook mentions. \nThe impact started small, but he was finally making one. \n“That was probably one of the biggest moments so far this year for me because it was just the biggest eye-opener,” he said. “I finally got thrown the ball. I caught a ball in a big game. Everyone’s texting me that they’re so proud and happy. It’s a great feeling.” \nOff the field, Peavy’s doing everything he can to avoid another hamstring injury. He carves out plenty of time to stretch before and after practice and takes advantage of UW’s cold tubs following workouts. \nOn the field, he’s becoming much more involved as the season progresses and building more trust with quarterback Joel Stave. \n“I thought he made some big plays (against Nebraska),” Stave said. “A big catch in the two-minute drive. A big catch down at the goal line on third down. I thought he did a really nice job being able to be consistent, be in the right spot and make some nice plays. \n“I think he’s done a great job throughout this season, but also in practice just feeling more and more comfortable with his role.” \nFirst-year UW coach Paul Chryst has spoken highly of Peavy since spring practice and was surprised to find out after the fact his catch against Alabama was the first of his career. \nThe coach believes Peavy’s a player that will only improve with time. \n“I think he’s a guy that, as he experiences good things, that kind of propels him,”   he’s building genuine confidence. I know that we as coaches, Joel has confidence in him, and I think that kind of helps propel yourself to keep going. \n“He’s a good player. He can continue to be even better.” Peavy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:25:21.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
