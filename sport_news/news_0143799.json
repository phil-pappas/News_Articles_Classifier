JEFF CHIU, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By SCOTT M. REID / STAFF WRITER SEND PDF NFL vice president Eric Grubman, the league's point person on the Los Angeles situation, said a vote on which team or teams will relocate there could come as soon as January. JEFF CHIU, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS \nNEW YORK - The NFL's point man on Los Angeles said Wednesday the league is on a path to holding a January vote on which team or teams will relocate to the nation's second-largest market. \nNFL executive Eric Grubman also said the league has received an offer sheet from the city of San Diego for a proposed stadium in Mission Valley, but that the league has not responded yet. Grubman said the league also anticipates receiving an offer sheet from a task force appointed by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon that has proposed a new downtown, waterfront stadium in St. Louis. \nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell said he expected the matter to be decided by a vote of NFL owners. Under NFL guidelines, franchises need the approval of three-quarters of the league's 32 owners to relocate. \n\"There's interest in being back in the entertainment capital of the world,\" Goodell said. \"But we have to do it right.\" \nThe comments came after a series of meetings in which Los Angeles was the main topic. Chargers owner Dean Spanos, Rams owner Stan Kroenke and Raiders owner Mark Davis all met individually with remaining owners and then excused themselves from a lengthy afternoon meeting in which the Los Angeles situation was candidly discussed by the remaining 29 owners. \nGoodell and Pittsburgh owner Art Rooney II both said the league's relocation guidelines were emphasized throughout Wednesday's meetings.
