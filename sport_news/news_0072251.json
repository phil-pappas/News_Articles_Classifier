Principals and board members from other local and international schools will also be on hand to witness how youth baseball offers unparalleled opportunities to learn and nurture valuable life-skills and celebrate diversity.\nGrand Slam Baseball develops youth and adult baseball across India while creating life-changing opportunities for players and coaches both in India and abroad. Whether it's enabling government school students to play alongside athletes from the country's best institutions, or of using the game of baseball as a means to enable India's brightest candidates to attend universities in the United States (and elsewhere), Grand Slam Baseball is bringing a sporting revolution to India.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQF0EwQ6VEc"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:56:58.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
