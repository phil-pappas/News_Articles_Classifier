He hasn’t been ruled in either. Elaine Thompson The Associated Press i Order Reprint of this Story SEATTLE \nIf you were hoping Thursday for aspecific update about the injury status of Washington quarterback Jake Browning, well, sorry. \nHuskies coach Chris Petersen reiterated Thursday that Browning is “day-to-day” with a shoulder injury, and did not confirm whether he’ll play Saturday night against Stanford. \n“He’ll be there,” Petersen said. “He’s been out at practice. He’s thrown some balls. All those type of things. So we’ll figure it out at game time.” \nPetersen said he has “a little bit of an idea of what we’re going to do” at the quarterback position. \nBrowning injured his right, throwing shoulder late in last week’s loss to Oregon. He threw a touchdown pass three plays after being injured, but did not return to the game . Redshirt freshman K.J. Carta-Samuels, who replaced Browning after the injury, would likely start against Stanford if Browning cannot. \nSenior linebacker Travis Feeney, who also injured his right shoulder against Oregon, is also — you guessed it — day-to-day, Petersen said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:55:21.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
