A refrigerated delivery truck owned by Columbia Empire Meat Company had crashed into a power pole. The driver, 43-year-old Joseph Ely, was still trapped inside.\nTualatin Valley Fire and Rescue firefighters, Sherwood police officers and sheriff's deputies \"could not approach the truck because there were power lines lying across it,\" Sgt. David Thompson, with the sheriff's office, wrote in a news release. \"A crew from Portland General Electric responded quickly and was able to cut power to the lines.\"\nEly, of Sherwood, told deputies that he lost control of his truck at a curve before he hit the pole. He sustained minor injuries and was treated at the scene.\nAuthorities did not cite Ely for the crash.\nâ€” Nuran Alteir\nnalteir@oregonian.com\n503-294-4028\n@whatnuransaid", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/whatnuransaid"], "published": "2015-10-24T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:45:37.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
