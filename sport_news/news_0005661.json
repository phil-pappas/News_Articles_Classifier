Photograph by: Jason Payne , PNG \nIn the early Rocky film ser­ies, Ev­ery­man box­er Rocky Bal­boa leans on his shriv­elled, grav­el­ly-voiced cor­ner­man Mick­ey Goldmill (ac­tor Bur­gess Mere­dith) for ring ad­vice. \n“Ya waltzin’ You movin’ like a bum.” \nIn Days of Thunder, it’s seen-it-all crew chief Har­ry Hogge (Rob­ert Du­vall) teach­ing hotshot ra­cing rook­ie Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) what to do when there’s a spinout and smoke on the track. “Go to the top of the wall and gun it.” \nBasic­ally, the sto­ry is the same in the Canadian Football League. \nWhen the kicks go bust, a re­boot be­gins with a call to a 67-year-old sage — Don Sweet, one of the most as­tute kick­ing coach­es in the game. \n“He’s al­ways there for me,” says Chris Milo, the kick­er for the Ot­tawa Redblacks. “When a kick­er has troubles, he’s often alone, in a cor­ner by him­self. We’re like hock­ey goal­ies. There aren’t a lot of others around who can re­late to you. Don is a wise man who knows what we go through. He’s a friend when you need him. More than that, he’s like a se­cond dad.” \nWhile every CFL team has a spe­cial teams coach who is in charge of kick­ers, rare is the coach who actually has played the pos­ition. The tiny im­per­fec­tions that re­sult in a wide-right, wide-left miss or out­right shank need to be de­fined by some­body with a re­fined in­ter­est in that as­pect of the game. \nSome­times only an­other kick­er knows best. \nThough sep­ar­at­ed by three time zones, Mi­los puts in a call to Sweet, a re­tired col­lege prin­ci­pal who lives in Langley, B.C., as part of his pre-game rit­ual. He was rec­om­mended to the for­mer Mont­real Alouettes-kick­er punt­er by Craig Smith, dir­ec­tor of play­er per­son­nel for the Sas­katch­ewan Rough­riders. Se­lect­ed by the Riders in the fourth round of the 2011 draft, Milo had his best sea­son with Sas­katch­ewan in 2013, the year he began work­ing with Sweet. He made 88.5 per cent of his field goal at­tempts (46 of 52, with a long of 50 yards) and says it was no co­inci­dence. \n“He trans­formed every­thing I was do­ing, through lit­tle ad­just­ments in tech­nique,” Milo says. “He worked with me on the men­tal as­pect, de­veloping bet­ter focus. He’s been so bene­fi­cial to my game, from what it is to what it is now.” \nProve your­self a cham­pion, and they will love you for­ever. Given the fickle na­ture of the game, and the stifled aspir­a­tions of foot­ball coach­es and fans, a kick­er truly knows how easy it is to fall from hero to wretch­ed fail­ure. \nAfter he strug­gled last sea­son (71.4 per cent), Milo was let go by the Riders in July this year and re­placed by Paul McCallum, a for­mer Sweet stu­dent who in turn had been re­leased by the B.C. Li­ons. \nSweet’s steady in­sist­ence that Milo was mere­ly in a tran­si­tion phase before an­other op­por­tun­ity came helped ease his dis­appoint­ment. \n“He told me to keep work­ing out be­cause a call was go­ing to come,” Milo said. “He knew, be­cause he’s been through that.” \nSure enough, after the Redblacks re­leased im­port kick­er Delbert Alvarado, Milo was back in busi­ness, in more ways than one. He has been suc­cess­ful on 13 of 15 at­tempts (86.7 per cent) for Ot­tawa since his ar­riv­al \nIf there are sim­i­lar­ities in tech­nique and men­tal ap­proach by a num­ber of CFL kick­ers and punt­ers — Milo, Ed­mon­ton’s Sean Whyte, Cal­gary’s Rene Pa­re­des and Rob Maver, Sas­katch­ewan’s McCallum and B.C.’s Rich­ie Le­one — it’s be­cause Sweet in­spir­a­tion has touched all of them. \nEven though he no long­er works with the con­sult­ant, who char­ges for his cli­ents on an hour­ly basis, Whyte still re­gards Sweet as his con­science, when­ev­er the Es­kimo kick­er-punt­er lines up to boot. Whyte was awarded the Lew Hay­man Trophy as the East Division most out­stand­ing Canadian in 2011, when he set a Mont­real Alouettes re­cord with 24 con­secu­tive field goals. Mont­real re­leased him this year before he was signed by the Es­kimos to re­place in­jured Grant Shaw. \n“Don started train­ing me as a fam­ily fa­vour (Whyte’s uncle, Gord, was a for­mer jun­ior col­lege team­mate of Sweet),” Whyte says. “I no long­er see him, but I still hear him. If my tim­ing is wrong and I mess up, a voice in my head says, ‘Slow it down, you pulled your head up.’ It’s Don. He taught me so well that I know exact­ly what to do to fix it my­self. That same voice is still cor­recting my mis­takes.” \nWhile Sweet rep­re­sents long-dis­tance learn­ing for most CFL play­ers, Le­one, the Li­ons rook­ie kick­er-punt­er, gets the bene­fit of face-to-face dis­cus­sion and hands-on in­struc­tion. Sweet is re­tained by the Li­ons as a kick­ing con­sult­ant, though he is not part of the coach­ing staff. \n“I’m for­tun­ate that he’s just down the road from me,” Le­one says. “It says a lot about him that a lot of other kick­ers trust in him. If he can work me into his sched­ule, I’m grate­ful. I’m young, a rook­ie and he’s mould­ed my mind in many ways.” \nAfter last Sat­ur­day’s 29-23 loss in Ed­mon­ton, a game in which he missed a 15-yard field goal at­tempt and shanked a punt before the Es­kimos win­ning touch­down, the down­cast Le­one was es­pe­cial­ly grate­ful for his coun­sel. \n“It was plain to see what I did wrong,” he says. “Don told me, ‘You did a lit­tle of this, a lit­tle bit of that.’ It was a quick fix.” \nIn the CFL, school is never out for in­struc­tion in the Sweet sci­ence of kick­ing and punting. \nmbeamish@vancouversun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:41:56.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
