But it's not over yet. Shereesha Richards , the 6-foot-1 human pogo stick, has one more winter left with coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson and the rest of the Great Danes. And that can only be bad news for the rest of the America East.\n\"Ever since my sophomore year, people would come up to me and ask, 'Are you a senior?\" Richards said at UAlbany's media day Monday afternoon in the Hall of Fame room at SEFCU Arena. \"Now, it's finally here. It really doesn't feel like I am a senior.\"\nAnd then, a smile.\n\"I'm not ready to go,\" she said.\nBefore she does take her final bows, there is a little more work to do. Richards has been the focal point of the UAlbany offense and defense ever since she got there. She has averaged 17.2 points in her first three years. Last season, when the Danes went 24-9 and nearly shocked Duke in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Richards scored a program-high 694 points and averaged 21.0 points. She also picked off 8.8 rebounds per game.\nRichards' dominance inside was evident all season long. Teams would double- and triple-team her hoping to slow Richards down. It didn't work. Richards scored 20 or more points 17 times. She had 12 double-doubles. For her career, she has 1,668 points, and counting.\nThe game has come so easy to Richards, who is originally from Jamaica and has only been playing basketball for six years. It's so easy, that sometimes her teammates find themselves being spectators to Richards' talent.\n\"A lot of times,\" junior forward Imani Tate said with a laugh. \"Coach will be yelling at me, 'Why aren't you in there getting the rebound?' Well, Reesie is in there. It is so much fun playing with her.\"\nIt might be even better for Richards' final go-round.\nIn the first three seasons, Richards has played exclusively at the power forward position. This year, Abrahamson-Henderson said she will use Richards at the small forward as well.\n\"That is scary,\" Abrahamson-Henderson said. \"But she is that good. I told her last year we were going to move her there. She will still play the four (power forward), but playing the three (small forward) will help her at the next level.\"\nOver the summer, Richards spent some time here, practicing her game as well as working at the Healthy Cafe. She has only attempted eight 3-pointers in her first three seasons (she made three). Expect to see her launching more from long distance this year. That could make her even more dangerous night after night because she won't abandon her powerful inside game.\n\"There are always things I can work on in my game,\" she said.\nAbrahamson-Henderson, of course, will be sad to see Richards walk out of her program next when she graduates with a degree in criminal justice next spring. But, for the next five months, she'll have her in the fold. And she, and anyone else who follows the UAlbany program, have to like that.\n\"You know, if your best player is your hardest worker, you are a pretty darn good coach,\" Abrahamson-Henderson said. \"She is a lot of fun to watch. I just smile and say, 'Well it's impossible to guard her.' \"\ntwilkin@timesunion.com • 518-454-5415 • @tjwilkin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:15:34.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
