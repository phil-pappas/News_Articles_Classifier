In a statement emailed Monday to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the University of West Georgia said only that there were “activities confirmed to be in violation of university policy and the student code of conduct.”\n“There are standards of conduct for all student organizations,” the university’s statement said, in part. “Both Tri Delta national and the University of West Georgia are fully committed to enforcing acceptable behavior within our standards of conduct. Student success and safety remain a priority.”\nThe official who sent the statement said that, because the school’s investigation is “ongoing,” she could not provide more information about the misconduct or when it is alleged to have occurred.\nA change.org petition started by one West Georgia Tri Delta sister, however, claimed the alleged hazing “took place several years ago.” The petition, which had more than 1,450 signatures by early Monday afternoon, asks for the sorority to be reinstated.\n“There are no sisters active today that have initiated any hazing events,” the petition said. “The sisters accused under this investigation are no longer at UWG. They have since left or graduated. Therefore, we are being punished for violations we did not commit and have no opportunity to defend ourselves.”\nOne signer, who identified herself as the sorority’s chapter president, said “the rug was ripped beneath us.”\nAttempts to reach out to sorority members directly were not immediately successful.\nThe University of West Georgia is in Carrollton, about 50 miles west of Atlanta.", "external_links": ["http://www.tridelta.org/news/delta-delta-delta-closes-beta-iota-chapter-at-the-university-of-west-georgia/", "https://www.change.org/p/tri-delta-national-office-reinstate-delta-delta-delta-at-uwg?recruiter=406871631&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink"], "published": "2015-10-19T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:53:19.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
