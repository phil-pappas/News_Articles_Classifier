What The Patriots' victory decided is where it will be played. Binghamton (5-2, 3-1) earned the right to host the semifinal. If it's anything like what transpired Friday at Binghamton Alumni Stadium, it should be a dandy. \nCorning (4-3, 2-2) rallied from a 33-21 fourth-quarter deficit on the strength of two John Dobson-to-Danny Madden touchdown passes. \nThe first came on a 61-yarder. Madden ran a skinny post on the left side, caught a well-thrown ball about 15 yards downfield, broke a tackle and outran the pursuit to the end zone. Vitor Mourao's extra point made it 33-28, with 10:54 left. \nBinghamton's next possession ended with a Kyle Zingler interception of a fourth-down pass by Petrucci. His 30-yard return up the left sideline gave Corning possession at its 48.

Madden ran under it and kept his feet inbounds for a touchdown that tied the score and Mourao's PAT gave Corning a 34-33 lead with 3:08 to go. \n\"This is Danny Madden's first year playing football since he was a small fry,\" Corning coach George Bacalles said of Madden, a baseball standout who'll play in college for Division I St. Bonaventure. \"I love how competitive he is. John threw some great balls and we were able to use the pass, even though we don't like to.\" \nStarting on their 35 with 3:01 the uptempo Patriots turned to Young. He took an option pitch around the right end for 14 yards on the first play. A delayed handoff up the middle to Young went for 17 more to Corning's 34. Later in the drive, Young picked up 6 yards on an option left to Corning's 17 and then 11 more on the next play on a physical run up the middle to the Hawks' 6. \nOn the next play, Witherspoon, covered closely by Noah Flynn, got just enough separation and caught a perfect pass from Petrucci for the winning score. Rasheen Pettiford's two-point run capped the scoring. \nPettiford also sealed the victory with a leaping interception at midfield on a Dobson pass to the right sideline.

We can make it happen.\" \nThe teams played to a 14-all deadlock after one quarter. \nCorning's Devon Sullivan scored a pair of touchdowns in the first quarter, the first on a 36-yard pass from Dobson, another high-arching pass, and the second a 1-yard run. But Sullivan suffered a right-ankle injury after a 24-yard run in the second quarter. He did not return. Sullivan accounted for 62 rushing yards and 36 receiving before the injury. \n\"It's tough whenever you lose a starter, especially someone as talented as Devon,\" Bacalles said. \nEric Fortner and Christian Sindon each scored on 2-yard runs in the opening quarter. Fortner finished with a game-high 118 rushing yards on 12 carries. \nThe Patriots took a 21-14 lead when Petrucci found Pettiford on the right side for a 12-yard touchdown play in the second quarter. \nThen Young made it a 13-point spread in the third quarter on an impressive 45-yard catch and run. He caught a hitch on the right side, burst forward, followed with a sharp cut across the field and then decided to point back and chasing defenders as he eased into the left corner of the end zone to make it 27-14 with 8:49 left in the third. \nCorning answered late in the quarter, when Ali Muhammad, all 155 pounds of him, ran over a Patriots defender en route to a 13-yard touchdown run. Mourao's PAT made the Hawks' deficit, 27-21. \nExploiting massive holes in the middle, Fortner ripped off consecutive runs of 25 and 15 yards on Binghamton's next drive, one that ended with a 2-yard touchdown run by Petrucci to make it 33-21. \n\"I told them before the game, you can have a home game or you can travel, it's up to you,\" Ramil said in reference to the playoff game in a couple of weeks. \nPetrucci finished 12-for-23 for 195 yards. \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob 7 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1RND14O TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:24:24.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
