Live TV coverage is on BT Sport 1 and BT Sport 1 HD. Catch the highlights on Match of the Day at 10.30pm BST on BBC1. Radio coverage will be available on BBC Radio 5 Live. \nOverview \nJurgen Klopp is set to take charge of his first game as Liverpool manager, when the Reds travel to White Hart Lane on Saturday. The Merseyside club have had a difficult start to the season, which currently sees them in 10 th place after eight games. This prompted a change from the owners, who relieved Brendan Rodgers of his duties and appointed the two-time title winning former Borussia Dortmund manager earlier in the month. \nThe German manager has brought his trusted lieutenant Zeljko Buvac as his number 2 and will hope to start his reign with a win over Tottenham on Saturday. The mood had been upbeat since his arrival. However, the last couple of days have seen it sour a little following season ending injuries to defender Joe Gomez and Danny Ings, with both players suffering anterior cruciate ligament damage. \nKlopp will also start his reign without skipper Jordan Henderson, Christian Benteke and Roberto Firmino, who are yet to recover from their respective injuries, but could have the services of Dejan Lovren and Philippe Coutinho, who have returned to training. \nMeanwhile, Tottenham will want to continue their recent upturn in form, which has seen them go unbeaten in the last four Premier League games, of which they have won three, including a massive 4-1 win over league leaders Manchester City. \nMauricio Pochettino is also facing an injury crisis like his Liverpool counterpart, as he is still without key midfielders Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and summer signing Heung-Min Son. Dele Alli will start in midfield for Spurs, as they look to keep pace with the teams in the top four. \nWhat Managers Say \nMauricio Pochettino (Tottenham): \"We have watched a lot of games from Dortmund and we have a clear idea of how [Klopp] can play. He impressed us with his job at Dortmund, and we wish him all the best after Saturday. When you come into a new country as a manager, you have to convince the players that they can believe in your ideas and your philosophy - that's the first thing.\" \nJurgen Klopp (Liverpool): \"We want to look different, for sure. That's what I expect, that we can see that we have worked together. I want to see more bravery, more fun in their eyes, I want to see that they like what they do. We are playing against a very good team that has been together for some time. They [Spurs] look fine tuned, good together. We know how they want to play, but it's important to analyse our own situation.\" \nBetting Odds (888Sport.com)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:03:25.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
