The Ospreys (4-9-0, 2-2-0 A-Sun) now sit in fourth place in the conference standings, while the Bisons (9-2-4, 4-0-0 A-Sun) maintain their spot in first. \"This one hurts. I'm gutted for our girls because they played well and battled. We know Lipscomb is a great team and we came out with some good energy and unfortunately gave up a goal early,\" said coach Robin Confer . \"I thought we had some really good moments of possession and created chances. In the second half we were knocking on the door and against the run of play their kid hits a spectacular shot, which took us a while to get going from again.\" Lipscomb jumped on the board early in the eighth minute, when Arielle Hansford took a pass from Emily Rodgers into the middle of the field just inside the box, Hansford's shot went off the left post out of the reach of keeper , the ball curved inwards to roll into the right side of the net. Lipscomb pushed the lead to 2-0 in the 62 nd minute, when Alex Hickey found the back of the net with her back to the net on a half-volley just outside the box in the middle of the field. The Ospreys had their chances throughout the match but couldn't find the net, leading in both shots (19-8) and shots-on-goal (11-4).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:07:45.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
