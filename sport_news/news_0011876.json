Prosecutors had called for an 18-month prison sentence for the player's father. \nA judge had recently rejected an appeal filed by the player's lawyers to drop the Barcelona star from the case. \nMessi and his father are accused of defrauding Spain's tax office of 4 million euros ($4.5 million) in unpaid taxes from 2007-09. \nMessi's father made a payment of more than 5 million euros ($5.6 million) in August 2013 to cover unpaid taxes, plus interest. \nA date for the trial has not yet been set.
