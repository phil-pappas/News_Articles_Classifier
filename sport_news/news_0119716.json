(AP) - While leading the Atlanta Falcons to a surprising 3-0 start, first-year coach Dan Quinn has shown he can get a little emotional on the sideline. \nQuinn wasn’t happy that his defense gave up 28 first-half points at Dallas on Sunday. So, with Fox TV’s cameras watching, Quinn lit into his defensive players on the sideline. \nIt wasn’t an unusual style of coaching, but for Falcons fans it was an opportunity to see the emotional Quinn so animated. \nThe outburst seemed to work. The defense responded with a second-half shutout in the Falcons’ 39-28 win. It was Atlanta’s third straight fourth-quarter comeback win. \nOn Wednesday, Quinn wasn’t sure what interactions were shown on TV. Perhaps joking, he said he’d ask a staffer to look up a video replay. \nNo need. Quinn’s players remember the details. \n“He started with the DBs and went down to the D-line,” said safety William Moore. \nThe TV broadcast showed Quinn making forceful points to defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux and rookie defensive end Vic Beasley Jr. \nMoore said Quinn had the full attention of his players. \n“He’s one of the guys who doesn’t get riled up too often, but when he does you listen,” Moore said. \nQuinn, the former Seattle defensive coordinator, has been a high-energy presence from his first practice with the Falcons this summer. He runs alongside players during warmups and also runs from one field to another during practice. He put on padded gloves while standing in the middle of the defense during drills to demonstrate how to fend off blockers. \nSomething is working. The Falcons, coming off a 6-10 finish in 2014, are undefeated as they prepare to face the Houston Texans on Sunday. \nQuinn’s former boss, Seattle coach Pete Carroll, said this week he is following the Falcons’ success closely. \n“I’m watching every bit I can,” Carroll said. “We’ve been communicating throughout and having fun with it. … He’s having a blast and I couldn’t be more excited for him.” \nLinebacker Paul Worrilow said the Falcons’ new personality begins with Quinn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:26:40.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
