Vick had parted ways with the Jets after a dismal season and was left to wonder if any team would take a chance on an aging quarterback who, once upon a time, had been the most electrifying player in the N.F.L.\nSo Vick waited, maintaining a rigorous workout regimen and telling a reporter , “I just want to stay ready and confident when opportunity knocks.”\nOpportunity tapped at his door in August and Vick was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers after their backup quarterback, Bruce Gradkowski, was lost for the season.

The first ended when he was stopped on a fourth-and-2 run. The second was lost when he overthrew Antonio Brown on fourth-and-1. Vick said that that pass in particular “is going to haunt me for a long time.”\nSports of The Times A collection of columns offering opinion and analysis from the world of sports.
