Arsenal bounce back in the Champions League to hand themselves major lifeline By Luc Bailey (columnist) 21 Oct 2015 10:09:29 \nreads \ncomments \nArsenal claimed a more than vital scalp Tuesday night with a huge victory against Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. \nArsene Wenger's side were staring an early exit from the Champions League in the face after two opening losses. Their campaign was given a boost however with goals from Olivier Giroud and Mesut Ozil. \nThe two goalkeepers were in fine form as well of course, with Petr Cech using his experience to good effect to palm away two first-half attempts whilst keeping a well deserved clean sheet. Manuel Neuer in the opposing goal was at his astonishing best denying Theo Walcott the opener with a jaw dropping left-handed diving save. The German stopper couldn't claim the ball however just before Giroud, somewhat clumsily, bundled the ball into the net from a Santi Cazorla's free kick. Neuer was then tremendously unlucky in his efforts to keep out Ozil's last minute strike which replays showed had just crossed the line. \nDoes this result mean arsenal are finally going to step up a gear in their European campaign for glory this year, or is this just a one off only for them to falter in their next game? \nTeam selection did seem to highlight how important Wenger viewed this fixture though. Previously stating Alexis Sanchez would more than likely be rested for the game but instead chose to play the in form attacker in the hope he could ignite a much needed flame at the Emirates. Although David Ospina has seemingly been Arsenal's first choice for Champions League games, his injury meant Cech could step in for his European debut for the side. (A certain number of the Arsenal faithful May have breathed a sigh of relief when they heard the news, maybe...) \nIt was a frustrating night on the other hand for Pep Guardiola's men as even their own in form striker Robert Lewandowski failed to get any real sight on goal. Guardiola's side dominated the stats for possession and passes (as is to be expected), which has been known in the past to be a nagging pain for arsenal who themselves like to dominate those particular parts of the game, and has in some cases left them conceding goals and dropping points. However on this night it was not to be as the home side took advantage of sloppy play by the away side and capitalised on those mistakes. \nWith their league form strong and their European hopes now looking healthier, Arsenal fans can sleep a little easier for the time being. For Bayern, probably just a blip. A bad day at the office, as the saying goes.
