I don’t think it’s in his repertoire, holding back,” lock Dean Mumm laughed. \nSince the Wallabies landed in England nearly a month ago, word has filtered out about McMahon’s ‘no prisoners’ approach to training. \nVeterans quickly worked out that the safest option was simply to not cross his path. \n“Even at training, he’s just so physical,” explains 98-Test veteran Matt Giteau. \n“You know when you’re training against him that there’s never a gentlemen’s (agreement). \n“He comes hard. He’s 100 per cent in everything he does.” \nPocock, with eight turnovers won at the breakdown in his two World Cup starts this tournament, will be the team’s primary ball-fetcher – which should free McMahon up to impose himself on other areas of the game. \nAnd while Hooper’s tenacious defence will surely be missed, McMahon’s power running is expected to give Australia extra punch through the middle. \n“It allows me to just focus on that physicality and that defensive side of the game and really work on ball carries to bring that physical and hard leg drive into the game,” McMahon said.
