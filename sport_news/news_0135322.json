I started off badly by hitting it in the water on the first but I got over it and played some good golf out there,\" said the delighted Olesen.\n\"My putter started to get very hot out there and I holed a lot of great putts. So yeah, it was good fun. \"To be honest it's been very tough this season with an injury, also, and playing some bad golf. But I've been finding my way and just practicing hard and just hoping for it to come along at some point.\n\"We will see how the weather is tomorrow (Sunday) but if it's the same, there's definitely going to be a lot of birdies.\"\nFrenchman Benjamin Hebert holds down third place after 54 holes and is 13 under thanks to six birdies against just one bogey at Carnoustie.\nThailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat is a further shot back after carding eight birdies and two bogeys at St Andrews. The 26-year-old from Bangkok recently won the Paul Lawrie Matchplay, in August, for his second EPGA title and sixth professional victory.\nYoung Swede Joakim Lagergren is also five strokes behind Olesen as he carded the lowest round of the day with a 62, while Welshman Bradley Dredge and American Chris Stroud are also in the four-man group on 12-under.\nSouth Africa's four-time major winner Ernie Els remains in contention after a fine round of 66 left the man known as \"The Big Easy\" in a six player group, six shots off the lead. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:05:13.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
