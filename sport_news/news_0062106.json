(AP) - The Anaheim Ducks recalled star prospect Shea Theodore and fellow defenseman Korbinian Holzer from San Diego of the American Hockey League on Saturday and placed defensemen Simon Despres and Clayton Stoner on injured reserve. \nThe 20-year-old Theodore, selected 26th overall in the 2013 draft, had an assist in two games for San Diego this season. He was the Western Hockey League's defenseman of the year last season for Seattle. \nThe 27-year-old Holzer was scoreless in two games for San Diego. Acquired from Toronto in March, he has two points and seven assists in 58 career NHL games - all with the Maple Leafs. \nDespres was injured Friday night in the Ducks' 3-0 home loss to Colorado. He appeared to get hit in the head on a check by Tyson Barrie. Stoner was scratched against the Avalanche because of a lower-body injury. \nE WASHINGTON-IDAHO ST \nKupp totals 4 TDs as Eastern Washington tops Idaho St 45-28 \nPOCATELLO, Idaho (AP) - Cooper Kupp caught two touchdowns, threw for one and returned a punt for a score as Eastern Washington handled Idaho State 45-28 on Saturday. \nKupp, who came into the game leading the FCS in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, caught 14 passes for 161 yards. His 24-yard pass to quarterback Jordan West tied the game at 7-all early in the first quarter, and a 9-yard score from West later in the first made it 14-14. \nWest found Kupp for 29 yards with 3 seconds left in the half to give Eastern Washington (4-2, 3-0 Big Sky) a 10-point lead. Kupp returned a punt 76 yards in the third quarter to make it 38-21. West finished 29 of 46 for 323 yards and three touchdowns. \nMichael Sanders and Tanner Gueller combined to pass for 226 yards and three touchdowns for Idaho State (2-5, 1-3).
