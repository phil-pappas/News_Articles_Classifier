That's a challenge and we're trying to meet it.\" \nYou can't just flip a switch and find consistency which is why the Senators want to try to build towards it with victories. That was something they should have learned from last year. \n\"A lot of it is experience We have young players but at the same time they're guys who played a big role last year after what we through,\" Smith said. \"Once you go through both parts of it: Being on the inconsistent and losing side and then knowing what it takes to win 23-of-27 games, a lot being consistent comes with experience and leadership.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:35:31.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
