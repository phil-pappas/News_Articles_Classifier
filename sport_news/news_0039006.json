CSKA's Seydou Doumbia scored first when a penalty bounced off goalkeeper David de Gea's legs in the 15th minute. Manchester United's Anthony Martial headed in a cross in the 65th minute to equalise. And van Gaal said his team needed to improve in the second half after a sluggish start. \"In the first half we could not play in a higher tempo because it was too slow in my opinion and that is what I have said in halftime, that we have to improve in switching also, the game, from side to side, and that we have done in the second half better than in the first half, and in the second half we have created also more chances. We could have won I think but at the end I think it is a deserved draw,\" he said. Van Gaal added that he thought Manchester United were on schedule to qualify from Group B. \"I know that we have now two home matches and you can say that we are at home very strong, so I hope that we can win these games then you are nearly qualified or you are already qualified. It depends on all the reports of course. But then we have still an away match against Wolfsburg, so, we are on schedule I think,\" he said. United were looking to improve on a disappointing run away from home in the UEFA Champions League proper, having lost their last three away games.
