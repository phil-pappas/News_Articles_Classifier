(Photo: Patrick Durkin/Press-Gazette Media correspondent) Buy Photo \nAbout 80 years ago, our legislators grew so tired of the endless bickering and backstabbing of deer-hunting politics that they created the 360-citizen Wisconsin Conservation Congress. \nLawmakers basically said: “We’re locking you people into a room and not letting you out until: 1) You settle your differences; or 2) you run out of beer and baloney and force us to decide for you.” \nOh sure, that’s the WCC’s condensed history, but here’s the point: Yesteryear’s lawmakers had more important things to study than petty minutiae, and more important things to referee than hunting’s never-ending squabbles. \nOne must assume our current crop of full-time lawmakers is underworked. How else would they find time to initiate so many hunting laws and policies over the past few years? Their frenzied rush to enact a wolf season in 2012 helped spur lawsuits that put gray wolves back on the endangered species list in December 2014, and granted nighttime deer-hunting privileges to Lake Superior Chippewa tribal members earlier this month. \nWho thought we’d ever see headlines and gender-based angst over something as trivial as legalizing blaze-pink clothing for gun-deer hunting? Granted, blaze-orange clothing has been saving lives and sparing limbs in the deer woods since the late 1960s, but it’s no more visible than fluorescent pink, yellow or lime-green. \nThe trouble is, not all girls want to wear pink in the deer woods, and some women find the color silly, even insulting. Of course, some lawmakers act surprised by this backlash, but what did they expect? Given that it’s the only thing on some legislators’ résumés under the heading, “What I’ve Done for Women,” they deserve the wrath. \nLawmakers could have spared Wisconsin this annoyance by legalizing all fluorescent colors commonly worn by bicyclists, joggers, road crews and Adopt-a-Highway volunteers. Instead, they made pink clothing sound like it would save hunting itself by making it more fashion-friendly for females. Why not give all hunters, male or female, more hot-color options than blaze orange? \nMeanwhile, legislators also are busy rewriting the mentored-hunter law they birthed only six years ago. They wrote the law in 2009 in hopes of spurring license sales by letting kids hunt at age 10 if accompanied by an adult mentor. Now that lawmakers are realizing — but not conceding — it provided only a two-year bump in license sales, they’re working to eliminate the age requirement so kids of any age can hunt. \nI’m fine with that. Only Wisconsin and 10 other states have age restrictions on hunting, and nowhere do we hear of grade-schoolers running amok en masse in the deer woods with Dad’s .30-30 or .30-06. If you turn on nearly any outdoors TV show, you’ll regularly see parents supervising little kids in the family deer blind. The kid usually requires a “shooting sled” or other gun-mounting device to help hold and aim the firearm, but the process is safe and reliable. \nAgain, though, lawmakers are trying to change the mentored-hunter law without first asking the WCC and its 360 delegates to work out the details. Now, predictably, they’re wondering why hunter education instructors and the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation are opposing them. \nOne man leading the opposition is Ralph Fritsch of Townsend, a longtime WWC and WWF member. \n“We worked hard on this law in 2009 to get something everyone could agree to,” Fritsch said Wednesday. “We originally wanted the minimum age to be 8, but some people thought that was too young because some 8-year-olds are still small enough to ride in a child safety seat. We settled on age 10 because that’s when most hunter-education instructors said kids could physically hold and capably control a gun. I don’t object to a disabled person using a device to hold their gun, but kids shouldn’t be hunting if they’re not physically able to operate and control the gun on their own.” \nFritsch also opposes the current bill because it would allow mentors to carry a gun. The existing law allows only the mentored hunter to possess a gun. \nFritsch’s other grievance is a bill that would eliminate back tags for deer hunters. Granted, Wisconsin deer hunters like back tags. Or maybe they’ve just grown too used to them; kind of like dogs that can’t stop scratching even after being dusted, collared and shampooed for fleas. \nSigh. This is a case where legislators must step in to end the madness. We’ve had our chances to rid ourselves of the back tag irritation, but failed miserably. Since 1942, state law has required Wisconsin’s deer hunters — whether toting a bow or a gun — to display a 3.5-by-9-inch back tag between their shoulder blades. \nAs recently as 1994, 11 northeastern states from Wisconsin to New Jersey required them. But only one other state in the country — New York — still forces deer hunters to wear them. \nWe should beg lawmakers to cede this distinction to New York. But with this group, they’ll probably make everyone wear blaze-pink back tags in 2016. \nPatrick Durkin is a freelance writer who covers outdoors for Press-Gazette Media.
