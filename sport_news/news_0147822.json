Women expect something different. They aren’t rude enough to say it, but their eyes say enough when they see it. They don’t expect to see the same sized penis you would imagine for a slight man with delicate hands and feet. Something wrong happened on the assembly line for my body. Although I prefer taller women with bigger frames myself, I’ve found I have to date smaller women who are actually worried I might hurt them with my size, and then are relieved when it’s not too big.\nA new liaison is always stress-producing for me. I don’t want to go to the bar with a sign saying, \"I’m not as big as I look,\" but as a single man, I’m often hunted down by size queens who think I’m going to be a giant.\n— Little Big Guy, Winnipeg\nDear Little Big Guy: It’s time to look for an emotional relationship with someone who wants you for your personality, and not what she thinks your sex organ is going to look like. If you encourage a relationship to build to the point where the woman wants to be your girlfriend, your size (and hers) is likely not going to matter much.\nOne-night stands attract women who are looking for something superficial. And you should know, men who are too large for most women often get rejected because of the pain factor. So be a realist: look for a woman with depth who is not a size queen roaming the bars, and if things go better with delicate women, go with that.\nPlease send your questions and comments to lovecoach@hotmail.com or Miss Lonelyhearts c/o the Winnipeg Free Press, 1355 Mountain Ave., Winnipeg, MB, R2X 3B6\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:53:17.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
