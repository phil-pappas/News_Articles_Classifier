It's feeling better.\" \nIndy could use Luck this week when the Colts (3-2) host defending Super Bowl champion New England (4-0) on Sunday night, but the Colts have also found ways to win without him lately. \nBackup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw for 213 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Colts to a 27-20 win at Houston and he threw for 282 yards and a touchdown in a 16-13 overtime win at Jacksonville. \nThe two wins, both with Luck watching from the sidelines, has made the urge to play that much stronger. \n\"We all want to play,\" Luck said. \"Every athlete wants to be out there playing all the time. So when you're not out there you get itching to go and there's certainly a pep in your step.\" \nAfter missing the only two NFL games in his four-year career, it's still unclear what shape he is in. Practice wasn't open to the media on Monday and Luck wouldn't go into detail about what exactly he did. \n\"More,\" Luck said. \"Absolutely, definitely more. It was the same sort of how we would always do on a Monday, split between Hasselbeck and I.\" \nColts coach Chuck Pagano didn't reveal much either and only referred to the way Luck is throwing the ball as \"good.\" \nThe Colts got the season off to a rough start and Luck took much of the heat. He threw two interceptions in a loss to Buffalo and three more in a loss to the New York Jets before bouncing back with the Week 3 win against the Titans, when Luck was injured. \nThe two-time Pro Bowl quarterback would love to be back for this one. He is 0-4 against Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and New England in three seasons. He has six TDs and 10 interceptions in those four losses. Overall, the Colts are 1-4 against the Patriots in the playoffs since 2003, including a 45-7 loss in the AFC title game last winter. \nIt was obvious that Luck doesn't want to be watching the game in street clothes for a third straight week. \n\"I really hope not,\" Luck said. \"I really, really hope not. This certainly is a big game and it's the next game. It's a very, very good team that's undefeated coming to town. There certainly is a history between us and them, but it's also a new year.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:06:15.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
