Croft received his first action and was 5-of-11 passing for 27 yards. \nThe Gophers (3-2, 0-1 Big Ten) have the lowest-scoring offense in the conference this season and are 12th of 14 Big Ten teams in total offense. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:26:22.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
