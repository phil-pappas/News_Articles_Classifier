Volunteers coach Butch Jones announced Sapp's injury Wednesday and said that he \"can't really put a time frame on\" how much time Sapp would miss. Sapp, who is from Alpharetta, Georgia, played in each of Tennessee's first four games and made three tackles. Tennessee (2-2, 0-1 SEC) hosts Arkansas (1-3, 0-1) on Saturday. Jones said wide receiver Alton \"Pig\" Howard's status remains uncertain for the Arkansas game. Howard missed the Vols' 28-27 loss to Florida last week with an injury that hasn't been specified. ___ AP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:56:29.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
