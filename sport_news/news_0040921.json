Yeah, that had a lot of fans stuck between a high-five and a hallelujah, too, all the while asking themselves if it could really be true.\n“That’s just one game and we’ve got Houston next week so I don’t want to go too far with it,” Campbell sternly informed reporters who were eager to multiply this dramatic victory into much more.\nSure, just one, like Everest is one mountain, like Godzilla was one lizard.\nMiami Dolphins interim head coach Dan Campbell calls a timeout near the end of the first quarter with assistant head coach Darren Rizzi (left) at What we just witnessed, friends, was the largest margin of victory for a head coaching debut in Dolphins franchise history, and it was achieved by a former tight ends coach who took this job on as if he were jumping aboard a moving train. It takes a little boldness to do that. A little crazy, too.\nLet’s not kid ourselves, though. The most valuable commodity that Campbell brought to Nissan Stadium Sunday was the simple fact that he is not Joe Philbin. The Dolphins tried that, the steady hand, the calming influence, the organized mind, and all it got them was three seasons of mediocrity and a bonus month of misery that owner Stephen Ross could have avoided by making a coaching change in December.\nCampbell, 39, would have been a strange choice back then, never having head coached so much as a preseason game or an intrasquad scrimmage. At the moment, however, he is the perfect slap in the face, turning practice into a series of desperate one-on-one clashes, chipping layers of rust off stars who had forgotten how to shine.\n Ryan Tannehill is one of those. He completed 22-of-29 passes with two touchdowns, but talked more about the way Campbell “energized” the team the moment he took over and how the new boss wants to establish a mindset of “setting the tone up front.”\nThat refers to letting the offensive line lead rather than cowering in the confusion of who is playing what position, and the mystery of how a couple of long-time offensive line coaches, Tony Sparano and Philbin, could fail to build the unit into something dangerous.\nCampbell and offensive coordinator Bill Lazor risked an entire game plan on getting more from the same pestered players, plus first-time starter Billy Turner at right guard, and the reward was a 113-yard rushing day by Lamar Miller and a subsequent refreshing of Tannehill’s play-action game.\n“The first thing I thought of was college, running the ball and trying to be physical,” said Turner, who was a real steamroller at small-school power North Dakota State. “I talked to coach Campbell one day after practice and it wasn’t even about football. It was more of a man-to-man talk.”\n“Are you ready to do something big?” Probably something like that, something more than are you comfortable in knowing your assignments, like Philbin might have asked Turner, providing he spent much personal time with the underused second-year player at all.\nHey, it’s not always going to be so stark a contrast. The Dolphins haven’t changed players. They haven’t devised new schemes like the funky Wildcat formation of 2008. More than anything, they just got honest with themselves, about how much more they can give, and it was Campbell, the guy so nervous he worried about throwing up on his shoes, who threw that figurative ice bucket on them.\n“Our sideline was in it,” said Campbell, an NFL player himself just six years ago. “When the defense was out there, we’ve got offensive players yelling, and vice versa. We haven’t had that.”\nThe Dolphins haven’t had much of anything, to be honest, since that wobbly and somewhat unsettling win to open the season at Washington. Now they are 2-3. That, in combination with all this rah-rah talk, isn’t even enough to make Bill Belichick blink.\nMiami may actually have a team worth watching again, though, and you can thank Campbell for that. He didn’t just push all the right buttons Sunday, including the tossing of his first red challenge flag, he pounded them.\nAnd he had a blast doing it. Maybe Philbin did, too, back when he was the offensive coordinator of a Div. III national title team at Allegheny College, but let’s not talk about Joe anymore.\nLet’s focus instead on what’s left of this Dolphins season, which probably still will fall short of the playoffs but no longer will be short on passion.\nDOLPHIN HEAD COACHING DEBUTS\nCoach 1st game Opponent Year\nGeorge Wilson Lost 23-14 Oakland 1966\nDon Shula Lost 27-14 Boston 1970\nJimmy Johnson Won 24-10 New England 1996\nDave Wannstedt Won 23-0 Seattle 2000\nJim Bates Lost 24-17 Seattle 2004\nNick Saban Won 34-10 Denver 2005\nCam Cameron Lost 16-13 Washington 2007\nTony Sparano Lost 20-14 NY Jets 2008\nTodd Bowles Won 30-23 Buffalo 2011\nJoe Philbin Lost 30-10 Houston 2012\nDan Campbell Won 38-10 Tennessee 2015\n</p", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/18/d7/dc/101815-spt-dolphins-ae-7.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/18/c2/87/campy.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/275/img/photos/2015/10/18/d5/79/101815_spt_Dolphins001.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:17:32.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
