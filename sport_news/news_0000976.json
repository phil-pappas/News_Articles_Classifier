Native son Travis Wilson will conclude his career with the Utes within the next few months (January, perhaps?), but two current San Clemente High School Tritons are already committed to play for Kyle Whittingham, and if last weekend was any indication, more could be on the way.\nAs third-ranked Utah prepared to face Arizona State, commits Cole Fotheringham and Tucker Scott were joined by juniors Jack Sears and Isaac Rex in Salt Lake City, as the Tritons were on a bye week. The former two were on an official visit, while the latter pair’s presence was labeled an unofficial visit to the Beehive State.\nIs it too early to call the relationship between San Clemente High and the U. a pipeline? Probably not, considering San Clemente head coach Jaime Ortiz referred to it as such.\n“Travis kind of got the thing rolling a little bit,” he said. “(Co-offensive coordinator) Coach (Aaron) Roderick has done a really good job recruiting our athletes and having relationships with the families. He’s been the main focal point to get this pipeline going.”\nBeyond that work from Roderick, it’s been a fortuitous set of factors that has allowed a relationship to develop between the two programs. First, the Tritons have had a bevy of Pac-12-caliber athletes in their program in recent years. Second, both Scott and Fotheringham, as well as Rex, have big family connections to the Beehive State.\nScott’s father Lance played for the Utes in the early ’90s, so the young offensive lineman was already familiar with the program, while Fotheringham is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was really only considering Utah and BYU .\nStill, Scott said the fact he grew up a big Ute fan isn’t the primary reason he decided to commit to the program.\n“Just the whole brotherhood aspect of it is what I enjoyed, so that’s why I made my decision,” he said. “I went with my feeling. I didn’t take any outside pressure. I was like, ‘Utah’s my home and that’s where I want to go.’”\nBoth Scott and Fotheringham credit Ortiz for playing a big role in helping them get on the Utes’ radar.\n“I think Coach Ortiz does a good job presenting us to them, and they like tough-nosed football players,” said Fotheringham, a tight end, of the Utah coaching staff. “They play the same type of football that we try to do at our high school, so it’s a good connection there, and I’m just happy to try to be a part of it.”\nAnd unlike many prospects these days, Scott and Fotheringham are taking their commitment to the Utes seriously and won’t be backing out.\n“I’m 100 percent committed to Utah, and there’s no changing my mind at all,” Scott said.\nOrtiz has a lot to do with that, too.\n“I’m a firm believer that your word is your bond,” he said. “We’ve had one or two players decommit in the past eight to 10 years, but I’m a firm believer that it’s important the parents and the athletes do their job and their research in making sure when making a decision that they feel comfortable and it’s the decision you want to make.”\nAs for the juniors, Ortiz said it’s too early to get a read on them, but it stands to reason that Utah has a good chance with both, should interest remain.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:54:47.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
