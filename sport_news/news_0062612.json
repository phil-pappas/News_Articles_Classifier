Josh Miller (blue shorts) takes on Iain Jackson. Picture by Richard Harris. \nFrank Warren’s television channel started rolling for 7pm, with his fighters very much adding to the card promoted by Paul ‘PJ’ Rowson. \nDudley debutant Josh Miller, another pro product of Priory Park Boxing Club, had already got the bill up and running with an impressive performance. \n‘The Jackal’ dominated his super middle four-rounder with gatekeeper Iain Jackson, who had knocked out Matthew Parr in his last fight. \nBut Miller was in no mood to let him gain any confidence here, backing him up to pepper him with the jab and then pick his shots. \nJackson had to shake off a couple of right hands to the head and suck it up when tagged to the body. He saw the finish, though. Referee Kevin Parker raised Miller’s hand by 40-36 shut out. \nTelevision viewers didn’t have to wait long to see stoppages, with Brummie super bantam Raza Hamza and Leicester lightweight Lyon Woodstock both recording first round TKOs. \nHamza removed Krisztian Lakatos with a left hook to the body after just 22 seconds while Woodstock floored another Hungarian, Ignac Kassai, three times inside two minutes. \nLancashire’s Macaulay McGowan stuck to his boxing as former Midlands champion Kevin McCauley, who lives in Stourbridge, tried to rough him up. \nThe boxing centurion, in his 122nd pro bout at age 36, wasn’t troubled or hurt and took McGowan the distance, losing 60-54 with Parker after six. \nAn exciting light welter eight-rounder between Yorkshire’s Josh Leather and Worcester’s Michael Mooney ended at the halfway point. \nA right hand to the head floored Mooney in the fourth, he beat the count but didn’t truly recover. Parker stepped in after the onslaught resumed. Tyler Denny (red and black shorts) lands flush on the body against James Conroy. Picture by Mark Jones. \nRowley Regis’ Tyler Denny took part in his third pro contest at super middle and scored his first knockdown, over late replacement James Conroy. \nConroy sunk to the mat under a flurry of punches, after a right hook straight through the guard wobbled him at the end of the second. \nThe bell saved him in that instance and Denny stalked him from there, with Conroy using his bigger girth to hold on and smother his work. \nIt went to the cards, where Parker had it 40-35 to Denny, taking into the account the knockdown that he will have wish happened mid-round. \nThe fight night’s first of three 10-rounders lasted 30 seconds, with former world champion Paul Butler displaying his power. \nThe former British, Commonwealth and IBF title holder, who hovers between super fly and bantam, threw a lethal left hook to the body that saw Hector Rolando Guzman counted out. \nThat brought out Netherton’s Les Byfield, another from Priory Park, for a lightweight clash with Michael Stupart that took place at the third time of asking. \nAnd this time ‘the Minefield,’ who lost his pro debut before redressing the balance with a victory, displayed a marked improvement. Les Byfield (yellow and black shorts) rocks Michael Stupart. Picture by Mark Jones. \nFirst he sliced Stupart open by the left eye with a right hook in the first before, with blood pouring from the wound, he dropped him with a big right hand over the top come the second round. \nStupart could barely see as blood poured into his left eye by the third, when the doctor was called to the ring apron to examine the wound. Had cuts man Bob Plant not worked so well on it, he never would have lasted. \nHe was allowed to box but struggled to fend off Byfield, who picked his shots at will but couldn’t force an early finish. He will, however, be very satisfied with a 40-35 points success with Parker. \nThat brought us onto the main event, where Langford put his belt up-for-grabs for the first time against challenger Rios. \nHis followers went crazy when he emerged to the strains of ‘the Liquidator,’ before going toe-to-toe with national champion Rios. \nLangford promised to show how he can put his punches together and he didn’t waste any time, trapping Rios in the ropes for one onslaught with the bout still in the first. \nRios kept throwing back but his game-plan didn’t amount to much, as he looked to work the body from the southpaw stance. Tommy Langford (black and white shorts) attacks Christian Fabian Rios. Picture by Mark Jones. \nHe looked to be running out of steam when he was fanned by his coach with the towel between rounds, with Langford’s downstairs attacks slowing him down as he nicked the middle rounds. \nRios took to showboating in the sixth and dropped his hands, only to walk straight into a right hook to the mush when action resumed. \nLangford continued to step off and make the room to slip in the body shots under his guard, with left Rios wincing but gamely hanging on. \nThe three judges were called into play when the final sounded. \nAll were well in favour of Langford, Dave Parris and Steve Gray by 100-90 landslide. Phil Edwards had it 100-91. \nLangford dropped just a share of the round with the three judges, underlining the level of control he’d enjoyed. Mr O’Connor was the man in the middle. \nAston then took to the ring for his contest with Graham, who wouldn’t have landed a title shot even in victory after coming in 3lb overweight. \n‘Tank’ worked to his strengths as a slippery left-hander, with Graham settling into keeping the right hand loaded behind a tight guard. \nThat all went out of the window when a left hand sent Graham back-peddling as Aston jumped on him, throwing unanswered punch after punch in the corner until O’Connor stepped in. Ryan Aston peels away with a stoppage victory over Nathan Graham. Picture by Mark Jones. \nAn 11-fight line-up closed with Robinson’s shut out of Sajauka, who showed why he’s never been stopped in 21 paid outings. \nBut he even he had to concede he’d been tagged with a good one as he absorbed a right uppercut to the chin in the second, but he survived.
