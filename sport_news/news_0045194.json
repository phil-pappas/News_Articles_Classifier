(AP Photo/Michael Probst, file) Sponsored Links The Associated Press ZURICH â€” \nFIFA has provisionally banned President Sepp Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini for 90 days in the wake of a Swiss criminal investigation. \nThe move by the FIFA ethics committee further taints Blatter's 40-year career at FIFA, including 17 years as president. It also damages the hopes of Platini to replace Blatter in the February election. \nSwiss authorities turned up at Blatter's office at FIFA headquarters last month and interrogated him. The criminal case centers on Blatter allegedly misusing FIFA money by making a $2 million payment to Platini, who was questioned as a witness. \nBlatter was also questioned by Swiss investigators about broadcasting contracts sold to former FIFA vice president Jack Warner in 2005 that were supposedly undervalued.
