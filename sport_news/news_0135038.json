The one day wiffle ball tournament in Essex was a fundraiser for Breslow's Strike 3 Foundation, a charity he started in 2008 to help in the battle against pediatric cancer.\n\"We knew right away it was a perfect fit given that the fan base and donor base is connected to baseball and to sports,\" Breslow said \"It was just a matter of finding the right time and finding the right dates and fortunately we were able to do that this year.\"\nThis is the third charity wiffle ball tournament held in Pat O'Connor's backyard since the Spring, following the Slam Diabetes and Travis Roy Tournaments.\n\"This is a great caper to what was a great season of events here,\" O'Connor said. \"I think Craig and a lot of the teams from out of town are here for the first time.\"\nFellow Red Sox pitchers Rick Porcello and Rich Hill each had their own teams in the tournament. Ludlow native and new Red Sox head trainer was on Hill's team.\n\"It's unique. Everybody's having a good time,\" Porcello said. \"We're coming together to raise money for a good cause. It's really a pleasure to be here and happy that we can help out in any way for Strike 3.\"\n\"The funding that they've (the Breslow's) been able to give for research is amazing and that's what the key is to continue finding cures and finding answers for a terrible, terrible disease,\" Hill said.\nBreslow's Strike 3 Foundation hits close to home. His sister is a pediatric cancer survivor.\n\"For me, it's very personal,\" Breslow said. \"To imagine there was a point where we were going to be talking about the millions of dollars that was raised would be beyond reality at the time, but through a lot of hard work and the work of great volunteers and a lot of generous donors, we've managed to raise over $3,000,000.\"\nSaturday's tournament raised $25,000 just from the 10 teams that participated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:35:25.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
