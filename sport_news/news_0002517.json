He also was said to have ignored police requests to leave the hotel. \nAustralian Associated Press quoted Tomic's U.S. lawyer, Chad Piotrowski, saying there were \"completely inconsistent\" internal hotel security reports, and prosecutors agreed to dismiss the case on Wednesday. \nIt wasn't Tomic's first issues with police. In 2013 he had his drivers' license taken away after he was caught speeding near Brisbane a second time. A year earlier, he was placed under police investigation after an alleged brawl in a Gold Coast apartment spa. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:17:51.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
