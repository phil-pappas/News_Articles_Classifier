And when the Patriots stopped the Colts (3-3) on an odd-looking and ill-advised fake punt, the scrambling Brady eventually found LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard scoring pass that made it 34-21. \nAndrew Luck was 30 of 50 for 312 yards and three touchdowns in his first game back from an injured right shoulder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:34:52.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
