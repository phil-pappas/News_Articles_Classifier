It is not that Italy called up a Brazilian to lead its attack, but rather that it needed to in the first place. It is neither illegal nor exceptional anymore for national teams to field players born outside their country. Éder Citadin Martins, though born in Brazil, qualified for Italy on two grounds, both by residency (he has lived in Italy long enough) and family heritage (he is a dual citizen of both countries). But what is shocking to some Italians is that given the country’s history of wonderful strikers — like Luigi Riva, Paolo Rossi, Alessandro Del Piero and even Christian Vieri and Salvatore Schillaci, known by his nickname Totò — it had to borrow a player who was born and raised in another culture. Éder, who turns 29 next month, cannot understand the fuss about his selection. He was never asked by Brazil to play for its national team and has played for clubs in Italy since 2006. In March, he was called up for the first time by Italy’s coach, Antonio Conte. His goal against Azerbaijan last weekend was typical of the form that fans of Sampdoria have grown to know and love. Sensing the space behind Azerbaijan’s defense, Éder ran ahead of the play. Once the pass from Marco Verratti found him, Éder simply gave the goalkeeper no chance with his shot. Small and slightly chunky, swift and uncomplicated in his play, Éder is a true finisher. He senses hesitation in defenders, is quite direct and can finish seemingly any way that pleases him, especially with his right foot. Like Brazilians of old, he can impart swerve on long free kicks. He rarely seems to finish with anger, preferring to guide the ball, to caress it, beyond the keeper. “Éder?” said Brazil’s national team manager, Dunga, when asked by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper earlier this year. “He was on my list of players to watch in Europe. I’ve seen some film of him playing for Sampdoria; he has great touches, really Brazilian. “Conte picked him? Well, these days football is a global game, and footballers take the best offer they get. The Azzurri have pulled off a good stroke. Éder is a guy who can score goals.” Sound familiar? Before the 2014 World Cup, Spain selected Diego Costa to lead its attack, and Brazil’s then-coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, said something similar. Brazil, the World Cup host last year, was embarrassed at the tournament in part because once Neymar was injured, it had no striker worthy of the name. Costa — so far — hasn’t looked the part for Spain, either. He was dropped from the current roster for two reasons. First, he hasn’t fit in with the team’s style, scoring just once in nine games. In addition, Vicente Del Bosque, Spain’s coach, explained last week that he did not approve of Costa’s foul tactics when he played for his club, Chelsea, against Arsenal last month. Now that Spain has convincingly qualified without him, it will be interesting to see if Costa gets another game with La Roja. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:53:13.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
