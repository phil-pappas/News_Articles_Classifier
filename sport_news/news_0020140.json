The custodial sentence which finished in August and then there's the lashing sentence ... which I assume he's been kept in there because that hasn't been dealt with yet,\" his son Simon Andree told BBC radio.\n\"We have no idea what's going to happen in respect of that.\n\"I'm not criticising Saudi because it's their law, it's their way of life. My father has served his time, he regrets what's happened, he just wishes to come home now.\"\nHe said his father, who had worked for oil companies in the kingdom for some 25 years, was in poor health, had suffered cancer three times, and also had asthma.\n\"He's an old frail man and I fear this lashing sentence is potentially a death sentence for him,\" Simon Andree said. \"That's our biggest concern, which is why we are trying to raise the case now to get him out.\"\nBritain's Foreign Office, which warns on its website that there are severe penalties for possessing alcohol in Saudi Arabia, said embassy staff in Riyadh were checking Andree's health regularly.\n\"Ministers and senior officials have raised Mr Andree's case with the Saudi Government and we are actively seeking his release as soon as possible,\" a spokesman said.\nNo one was available to give an immediate response from the Saudi Embassy in London.\nThe Andree case comes just over a week after British Prime Minister David Cameron urged Britain's Middle East ally not to go ahead with the execution of a Shi'ite Muslim sentenced to death over his role in anti-government protests when activists said he was just 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:09:03.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
