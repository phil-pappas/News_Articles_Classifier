But this was his moment. He wasn’t going to let anything ruin it. Aeilts withstood a hit in the end zone and snagged his first and only touchdown reception of his career with 18.1 seconds left of Thursday night’s contest at Springfield Lanphier. Lincoln fell to the Lions 61-20 and finished 0-9 for the third consecutive season. But this last touchdown seemed to make up for all of the heartache. “I wouldn’t want to go out any other way,” said Aeilts, who has been the starting quarterback the past two seasons. “There was no way I was going to drop it. “It was the happiest moment of my life.” With the game far out of reach, the Railers drove to the 15-yard-line and called a timeout with 23.2 seconds left after Aeilts connected with sophomore running back Titus Cannon for 22 yards. As Lincoln coach Seth Bass approached the huddle, the idea of a trick play designed for Aeilts cropped up. “He told us this week — and we didn’t know this — that he’s never scored a touchdown running or catching the ball,” Bass said. “We wanted to give that moment to him, and we executed it perfectly.” Aeilts lined up at wide out and junior running back Andrew Yount handled the snap. Yount tossed a lateral pass to Cannon near the sideline, and Cannon lobbed the ball to Aeilts in the corner of the end zone. “We almost threw it too late,” Bass said. “But I knew if it was in the vicinity of Garrett, I knew he was going to make that play. There was no way he was going to let it go.” Aeilts deserved the honor, Cannon said. “It had to be Garrett,” Cannon said. “He told me all of the time during practice that he always wanted to catch a touchdown. It was special throwing the ball and letting him go up and get it.” Aeilts also threw a deep, 59-yard TD pass to Cannon down the middle of the field earlier in the fourth quarter to make it 55-13. “You get to go out throwing a touchdown and catching one in the same day, that’s something special,” Aeilts said. “I’m so thankful for the opportunity to do that.” Aeilts completed 10 of 16 passing attempts for 166 yards, one touchdown and one interception — most of those going to Cannon. Page 2 of 2 - Cannon caught eight passes for 144 yards and one touchdown. Both Aeilts and Cannon threw two TDs this season. Cannon tossed his first TD on another trick play at Decatur MacArthur in Week 7. “We finished the year tied for passing touchdowns, but all throughout the year he was one of my favorites to throw to,” Aeilts said of Cannon. Cannon just may be Aeilts’ successor next season. “It will be exciting,” Cannon said. “I’m going to get to try it a little bit Saturday at the JV game, so we’ll see how it goes.” Aeilts, meanwhile, said he wouldn’t change anything about his football career. “Playing four years in this program is something special,” Aeilts said. “We don’t win a lot of ball games, but the feeling you get playing football for Lincoln, you can’t find anywhere else.” By Bill Welt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:44:46.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
