Red Springs comes in undefeated behind their dominate defense (given up only 36 points to their opponents), led by Austin Fairley. They also use a strong run game behind a committee of backs, averaging over 215 yards on the ground. Last year, Red Springs finished with a 4-8 record and Whiteville took care of business 40-8. Winner of this game stays in the driver seat for the Three Rivers Conference. Monroe vs Central Academy Game Preview: Monroe (6-0) travels to Central Academy (4-1) Friday night in a Rocky River showdown. Both teams are at the top, as Monroe is led Zephaniah Wall (averaging 212 yards per game at quarterback and can be very dangerous. They use a pretty sound offensive balanced scheme, throwing for 172 and rushing for 259 per game. Central Academy wants to control the game on the ground with a committee of backs (have four players with over 185 yards rushing this season). Clinton vs Midway Game Preview: There is no doubt that Midway comes into this game seeking revenge form their blowout loss to Clinton 42-0. Ryheem Skinner leads the way for Clinton on the ground, as he is having a tremendous season with 822 rushing yards this season. Midway was able to bounce back from their first loss and have some solid wins this year early on, but this would be a big one in the conference for them. North Surry vs West Stokes Game Preview: North Surry has a talented quarterback in Avery Smith, posting impressive numbers so far this year. Smith has 1,310 yards passing and 18 touchdowns on the year but will now look to take home a win against West Stokes on the road. Head Coach Jimmy Upchurch hopes to provide another dominating stamp on his season like he did last year with a 32-10 win at North Surry. But North Surry has certainly improved from their 4-7 season last year and has hopes of a conference title.
