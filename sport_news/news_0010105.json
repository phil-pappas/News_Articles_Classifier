While the ‘Cats showed they can dig themselves out last week, they found out on Friday that the defending Class champions are another animal. \nValdosta (5-3, 1-2 in Region 1- ) fell behind Colquitt County 35-0 in the first half en route to a 49-14 rout at Mack Tharpe Memorial Stadium. The Packers more than doubled the Wildcats’ offensive output in the first half, out-gaining their region rivals 312-127 in the first 24 minutes of play time. \n“Obviously it didn’t turn out the way we wanted it to,” said Valdosta coach Rance Gillespie. “We made some mistakes early in the football game and they got rolling. They’re a good football team that was making good football plays early. \n“We just gave them a lot of momentum.” \nMaybe surprisingly when looking at the final score, Valdosta was the team with momentum early on. Colquitt County quarterback Chase Parrish tossed just his third interception of the season on a pass deep down the field on the Packers’ first possession of the game, igniting the Wildcats’ bench. \nThe celebration on Valdosta’s sideline would be short lived, though. Wildcat quarterback Seth Shuman found his tight end Jontae Baker with a first-down pass on third down, but Baker lost control of the ball as he crossed the first-down line and the Packers scooped it and returned it 44 yards for the score. \nColquitt County (8-0, 3-0 in region) forced Valdosta to punt after three plays on its ensuing drive, and the Packers immediately drove 43 yards to take a 14-0 lead on Parrish’s 11-yard run with 6:40 left in the first quarter. \nA dejected Valdosta team punted the ball back to Colquitt County when three straight runs couldn’t net a first. With the ‘Cats on their heels, the Packers increased their lead to 21-0 when senior receiver Kiel Pollard hauled in a short reception, slipped a tackle, and ended up 36 yards downfield in the end zone. \nThe early turnover seemed to take a little bit out of Valdosta, but Gillespie didn’t want to use the miscue as an excuse for poor execution on later possessions. \n“You’ve got to overcome that,” Gillespie said, but he stopped short of saying the turnover deflated his team. “In any other ball game you put the ball on the ground, you line up and play the next play. That’s what we have to do. \n“It’s just tough when you’re playing a team of that caliber.” \nAnother tough aspect of playing a team of Colquitt County’s caliber, the pressure the Packers put on opposing offenses to keep up with their high-scoring unit. \nTrailing 21-0, Valdosta sustained its first real drive of the game late in the first quarter. Taking over at their own 20-yard line, the ‘Cats marched 45 yards into Packer territory at the 35-yard line. But feeling the pressure to score, Valdosta attempted to convert on a fourth-and-7, and Shuman’s pass fell to the turf incomplete. \nParrish hooked up with Ty Lee on a 65-yard touchdown pass on the next play to put Colquitt County up 28-0. A few drives later, Parrish threw his third touchdown of the night when Pollard managed to pull down a ball deflected into the air and take it into the end zone with one second remaining in the half. Parrish finished the game 13-of-19 for 257 yards. \nLuckily for Valdosta, the ‘Cats do have some positives to take from the rough loss. Valdosta outscored Colquitt County 14-7 in the final quarter scoring plays from DeAngelo Williams’ (1-yard run) and Wesley Veal (61-yard catch). Veal also had a 28-yard catch to set up Williams’ score, as he’d finish the night with five catches for 117 yards. \nShuman completed 17-of-28 passes for 212 yards and a touchdown while keeping the interception column free of blemishes for another week and Valdosta finished the game with 77 rushing yards and 289 yards of total offense. \nStill, Gillespie and his team can’t be happy with falling into a 42-0 hole, especially with the Winnersville Classic coming up after the bye week. \n“Obviously this is not good enough,” Gillespie said. “We expect a lot better. Our kids are hurt; it bothers us, and I want it to. It is important to our kids. Our kids put in a lot of work. We expect to come out and play better and be more competitive than we were tonight…. \n“Hopefully that drives them to go to work and put in the work that’s going to be necessary to beat Lowndes.” \nDerrick Davis is a sports reporter at the Valdosta Daily Times.
