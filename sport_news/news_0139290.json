When the younger kids get in the game, seeing them do some things we’ve been working hard on in practice is certainly a positive. \n“We know we’re going to play tougher opponents (coming up) and we’re going to give up points, that’s just part of it. But the kids have really started to take some pride in that side of the ball and we’ll try to keep on doing it.” \nThere was no letdown for the Falcons despite facing an opponent they had throttled just seven days before. \n“The kids came out and did what they were supposed to do,” Walker said. “They executed, minus a few penalties, on offense. And on defense, we did what we were supposed to do.” \nIt showed, as the Falcons held a 436-80 edge in total yardage, and 63 of the Tigers’ yards came on their final drive of contest. Versailles couldn’t crack positive yardage in the run column, as the Tigers rushed 24 times for minus-4 yards. \n“We’re really playing well on defense,” said Jake Van Ronzelen, who had one of the Falcons’ three interceptions, joining C.J. Closser and Brenden Brown. “Our secondary has been doing good and our line has been putting a lot of pressure on teams. Everybody is playing really well.” \nVersailles went three-and-out on its first six possessions of the night, netting minus-17 yards, and Blair Oaks scored touchdowns after all six of them. \nVan Ronzelen scored the first touchdown of the game for the Falcons on an 18-yard run. It was the first score for Van Ronzelen, who has been slowed this season by a lingering shoulder injury, since he had two touchdown runs in Week 2. \n“That was nice,” Van Ronzelen said. “I’ve been hurt for a while, so it’s good to get the ball in my hands again. I’ve really missed (playing offense) — I like being out there.” \nTanner Lueckenhoff blocked a punt after Versailles’ second straight three-and-out, and Closser scored one play later on a 14-yard run. \nAfter another punt by the Tigers, Blair Oaks needed just one play to score again, this time on a 33-yard pass from Jordan Hair to Adam Schell. \nIt took the Falcons slightly longer to score their final touchdown of the first quarter after the Tigers punted again. It still took Blair Oaks just one play to get in the end zone, but the Falcons got whistled for delay of game before they ripped off a 55-yard scoring run by Closser. \nAfter one quarter, it was 30-0 and the Falcons were on their way to 70 again. \nWith the second-string offense in after the first quarter, Nolan Hair hit Ethan Luebbering with a 40-yard strike for the lone score in the second quarter. The Falcons’ lead was 37-0 at intermission. \nAbout the only negative to the first half was running back/defensive back Cody Alexander got hurt midway through the first quarter while making a tackle. He came back for a limited number of snaps, but departed soon after with the game in hand. \n“We think it was just a stinger,” Walker said. “His neck was giving him some discomfort and we’ll watch him over the next couple days and if we need to have him get an MRI done, then we’ll get the MRI done. \n“In this kind of game, you worry about injuries. But Cody made a great tackle. From my angle, it looked like it was a picture-perfect tackle. We’re hoping that it’s not anything serious and he’ll be ready to go, but we don’t really have any control over that.” \nBlair Oaks scored four touchdowns in the third quarter to lead 63-0. They got scoring runs from Schell (51 yards), Nolan Hair (8 yards) and Sam Dudenhoeffer (41 yards) and an interception return from Closser (47 yards). \nWhen Brayden Pritchett scored from 13 yards out with 7:55 left in the game, the only drama remaining was whether or not the Falcons would get the shutout. \nVersailles put together its best drive of the game, going 67 yards in 13 plays, before Brown came up with his interception to preserve the shutout. \n“Coach Walker is always happy when we hold the other team under 12 points,” Van Ronzelen said with a smile. \nAs the top seed in the district, Blair Oaks will host Friday night’s semifinal game against fifth-seeded Eldon. The Mustangs beat the fourth-seeded Owensville Dutchmen 56-33 on Friday at Owensville. \nEldon gave Blair Oaks its toughest game of the season back in Week 3, as the Mustangs led 7-0 after one quarter, 21-12 at halftime and 35-32 after three quarters. \n“Eldon got up on us 14-0 to start and it was 21-6 at one point, so they were up on us by two scores,” Walker said. “I’m sure they’re going to come in here feeling like they can win the game. We’re going to have to meet their intensity with our own and we’re going to have to execute on offense and defense and special teams. If we do that, we’ll give ourselves a chance to be successful.” ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:11:04.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
