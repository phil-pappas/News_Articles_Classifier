Another reminder, if any was needed, that club owners are not shy of taking decisive action when they really feel it is necessary. \n2) THERE SHOULD NEVER BE DOUBTS ABOUT SERGIO AGUERO \nManchester City striker Aguero went into Saturday's home clash against Newcastle with it being noted he had scored only once in the league to date in 2015-16, and not since mid-August. He subsequently netted five times in 20 minutes past the stunned Magpies, becoming only the fifth man ever to hit that tally in a single Premier League game. The 27-year-old Argentina international could hardly have produced a more bold statement about the powers he possesses. \n3) THERE REALLY SHOULD BE DOUBTS NOW ABOUT CHELSEA \nWhen the Blues beat Arsenal on September 19 it appeared they had finally stopped the rot with regard to their poor start to the season. But a scraped 2-2 draw at Newcastle saw alarm bells ringing again a week later - and Saturday's 3-1 capitulation at home against Southampton showed Jose Mourinho's men are far from over their troubles this term. Where their title defence goes from here - and whether Mourinho might be involved for much longer - is anyone's guess. \n4) THE NORTH-EAST CLUBS APPEAR TRULY CURSED \nNewcastle and Sunderland started Saturday bottom and 19th respectively and without a league win between them this season. Both made very encouraging starts to their fixtures, the Magpies taking a surprise lead at the Etihad Stadium and the Black Cats racing 2-0 ahead at home against West Ham. Each side then spectacularly imploded, Newcastle finishing up on the end of a 6-1 hammering and Sunderland concluding their game with 10 men and having been held to a 2-2 draw. In either case, the fans must feel as if there is some kind of jinx on their club. \n5) DICK ADVOCAAT SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE JUST KEPT HIS PROMISE TO HIS WIFE \nWhether or not he thought anything sinister was going on, Advocaat was left in no doubt his time as Sunderland boss could not go on as he walked away from the club on Sunday. There has been a slight air of inevitability about the situation since the campaign began, and many - certainly now, if they did not already - will feel that after keeping the Wearsiders up last season, the 68-year-old Dutchman really should have stuck to the promise he initially made to his wife that he would retire over the summer.
