(Photo: , Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) \nAUBURN – After surviving a scary car accident where he rolled his SUV Sunday afternoon, Jalen Harris was back watching practice two days later. \nHarris, the freshman tight end from Montgomery, wasn’t active for the team’s first practice during the bye week but Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn said he expected Harris to be back “before the week is out”. \n“He’s physically okay,” Malzahn said. “I think emotionally that was a tough deal. That was a very scary deal. We’re counting our blessings for him.” \nHarris flipped his Chevrolet SUV Sunday afternoon and walked away without significant injuries. \nHarris posted pictures of his totaled vehicle on his Instagram account Sunday with the message “I’m blessed that’s one thing that I know. Angles (sic) watching over me everywhere that I go.” \nMalzahn confirmed the news of Harris wreck on his ‘Tiger Talk’ radio show Monday evening saying Harris called him immediately after the wreck while driving back from church and his SUV rolled onto its side. Photos from Harris’ Instagram account show the vehicle was crushed in from both the front driver and front passenger side along with major collision damage to the front grill and windshield. \n“If you look at his car, it's definitely a blessing that he's doing well,” Malzahn said. Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn talks about Duke Williams' dismissal \nAccording to reports, Harris was by himself in the vehicle but no other details were provided about the accident. Several of the Auburn players on the 2015 roster responded in the comments section on Harris’ Instagram account. \n“He wasn’t out there (at practice) with us today, but I feel like he’ll probably be back before the week is out,” Malzahn said Tuesday. “We’re just letting him heal up emotionally. That’s a scary deal.” \nHarris, a three-star local prospect from St. James School in Montgomery, was named Auburn’s starting tight end in his first college season. Harris has seen action in each of the last four games this season without catching a pass yet in the 2015 campaign. \nHarris was rated as a three-star prospect by most of the recruiting services after he led St. James to a 2014 regional championship. Harris had 23 catches for 381 yards and four touchdowns in his senior season for a primarily run-based offense in high school. \nPictures of the aftermath following the car accident involving Auburn tight end and Montgomery native Jalen Harris.
