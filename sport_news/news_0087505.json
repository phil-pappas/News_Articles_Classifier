Ryan didn't lose his confidence, players say. He also didn't change everything overnight, but he heard the concerns of his star plays and maintains that his defense will rank near the top of the league . \n\"I believe him, too,\" linebacker Nigel Bradham said. \nDespite a laundry list of injuries on both sides of the ball, the Bills know they have to beat the Jaguars. Not only is their old coach Doug Marrone going to be on the opposite sideline, but the Jaguars are 1-5. This is a prime opportunity for the Bills to go into the bye week 4-3 and set themselves up for a playoff run in the second half of the season. Know the enemy \nThe Jaguars are coming to London at a low point . It's Gus Bradley's third season as head coach and the team has won just eight games since he's been there. The 2015 Jaguars are 1-5 and just lost at home to a struggling Texans team. This offense is young and mistake-prone. Blake Bortles has been putting up big numbers while the team plays from behind, but he still seems to make one crucial mistake each game. He has some weapons in Allen Robinson and Julius Thomas, but the Bills' defense should present a tough challenge for them. \nOn the defensive side of the ball, the Jaguars are near the bottom of the league in most categories. This is a team that has allowed 366 yards per game to opposing offense. The Bills may not have the fire power to take advantage, though. Sammy Watkins and Percy Harvin are both out, and the Bills will also be playing with backup quarterback EJ Manuel with Tyrod Taylor injured. Those injuries along with the fact that Buffalo is missing two starters on the offensive line could give Jacksonville's defense a chance. How to follow the game \nThe game will be broadcast on CBS in the Buffalo area and streamed live on Yahoo for the rest of the world. Syracuse.com will be running a live blog. You can also follow along with our coverage at the following Twitter accounts: \n@matthewfairburn What the Jaguars are saying \nRex Ryan's defense has come under a lot of scrutiny for not being aggressive enough, and he's not alone. Jaguars coach Gus Bradley is trying to find way to create pressure, and according to Mike Dirocco of ESPN , he may be ready to dial up more blitzes against the Bills. \n\"The way we're built we count on the leo on first and second down to bring that pressure,\" Bradley said. \"If we're not getting everything that we need then we've got to look at bringing pressure and taking a guy out of coverage. \n\"When you pressure, you're going to make some plays and you're going to give up some. It just happens to be like that. What we have to look at is if what we gain outweighs what we could give up. Right now, we have one interception in six games. To bring pressure with the idea of affecting the quarterback to get more turnovers, I think that's the stage we're at right now.\" What the Bills are saying \nThe Bills are without seven starters from their opening day lineup, and that could make things challenging against the Jaguars. Still, he's making sure to treat it like any other game. \n\"Well I don't know if it's a measuring stick or whatever it's just a game, and that's what this one is, just a game,\" Ryan said. \"Obviously we have a lot of good football players not playing this week — they're out with injuries and things — but it's not an excuse. ... We have to find a way to scratch, claw, do whatever it takes to get a win. But right now we feel good, and we feel confident, we know it's going to be a tough task, but I think we'll be up to it.\" Prediction \nThis is a game the Bills absolutely have to win. The Jaguars' defense is a mess right now, and the Bills' offense isn't going to be much better. That means the game could come down to what Bortles and Jacksonville's offense are able to do against a Bills defense that has spent the week hearing about how underwhelming it has been. Buffalo's defense needs to pull out this win. \nPick: Bills 20, Jaguars 16 Odds \nThe Bills are favored by 5.5 points , according to America's Line.
