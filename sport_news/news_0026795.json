The information is from a story on cbssports.com. \nDead money is the amount of money being paid to players no longer on the roster that counts against the team's salary cap. \nThe Saints have $31.07 million in 'dead money' out of the team's salary cap of $145 million and change. That's 21 percent of the cap being paid to players no longer on the team. \nThe bulk of it is to players let go – Jimmy Graham ($9 million), Ben Grubbs ($6 million), Curtis Lofton ($5 million) and Junior Galette ($4.2 million). \nThe most ominous note for Saints fans in the article is the fact that Galette's dead money for next year will be $12.1 million.
