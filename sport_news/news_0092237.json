Whitney football coach Marty Martin is an innovative thinker. \nMartin runs the only high school football program in the Central Section that uses the Guardian Cap, a protective soft-shell helmet cover, at the freshman, junior varsity and varsity levels. In a list compiled by Guardian Caps, as of July 1, the Pioneers are just one of 59 football programs in California from the youth to college levels that use them. \nThe Guardian Cap, which looks like a padded waffle iron and weighs less than 8 ounces, can be attached onto a regular football helmet. \nGuardian Cap manufacturers claim their product reduces the impact of a hit up to 33 percent. That study was completed by Oregon Ballistic Laboratories, an independent armor testing lab, in April 2011. \nMartin was first introduced to the Guardian Cap at a coaching clinic in San Francisco about four years ago, and after a brief presentation, he was sold. \n“We try to do everything we can to reduce the amount of impact,” Martin said. “It just made a lot of sense for me, so I came back, talked to my (athletic director) and started raising money for it.” \nMartin and his staff raised nearly $10,000 and bought 180 Guardian Caps in three colors (black, camouflage and red) in 2012. The shell costs $60. \n“I feel like if we can do those types of things — something to help protect those kids — then we should,” Martin said. “If we have to go out and raise the money for it then we have to go raise the money. It’s about protecting them.” \nAre the Guardian Caps working? \nSince the Pioneers have been wearing the Guardian Caps in practice, Martin has seen a dramatic drop off in head injuries. \nAnd the results are impressive. \n“It’s helped a lot,” Martin said. “I don’t believe that in the three years we’ve had them — this is our fourth year now — that we’ve had a concussion in practice while the players have been wearing them.” \nGene Pryor, a senior 6-foot-4 standout lineman for the Pioneers who is drawing interest from four-year programs, also believes the Guardian Cap is an effective add-on product. \n“The Guardian Caps with the additional padding and stuff, it really helps reduce the pressure on the hits,” Pryor said. “It’s just like wearing a regular helmet.” \nIf the product is so effective, why aren’t the Pioneers wearing them in games? \n“The problem is you just can’t get the decals and all that stuff on there,” Martin said. “At some point it may get to that. Hopefully, they’ll be able to do something with the technology and put your school logo on it. \n“I don’t think for us — at this point in time — that would be a good thing. Strictly because we’ve haven’t had issues with that. We haven’t had those kind of issues. For me, in the time that I have been here as coach, most of those types of injuries have happened during practice, and not in game situations.” \nWhat do the experts say? \nThe Guardian Cap is not certified by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, which commissions research in sports medicine and science to establish standards for athletic equipment. \nBecause the Guardian Cap is an after-market and add-on product, it falls short of certification, according to a July 16, 2013, statement from the NOCSAE. \nThe California Interscholastic Federation, which governs high school athletics in the state, prohibited the use of add-on products in athletic contests after NOCSAE’s original statement. \nThat stance abruptly changed after the NOCSAE sent out a revised statement on Aug. 8, 2013. \n“The addition of an item(s) to a helmet previously certified without those item(s) creates a new untested model,” the NOCSAE second statement read. “Whether the add-on product changes the performance or not, the helmet model with the add-on product in no longer ‘identical in every aspect’ to the one originally certified by the manufacturer. When this happens, the manufacturer which made the original certification has the right, under the NOCSAE standards, to declare its certification void. It also can decide to engage in additional certification testing of the new model with the add-on product, but is not required to do so.” \nSince the CIF was not made aware of a manufacturer which has declared a certification void, it reverted to its original position — allowing helmet add-on products for games. \nIn a study released at the 2015 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in February, researchers John Lloyd and Francis Conidi found that the Guardian Cap “reduce linear accelerations by about 11 percent compared to a standard helmet. However, their effectiveness in reducing angular accelerations is limited to only two percent.” \nIn conclusion, that study, which was supported by Brains Inc., and the Seeing Stars Foundation, declared: “Helmet add-ons have gained popularity in football, with the promise of injury prevention. Our research shows that these technologies have limited effectiveness in reducing the angular forces associated with concussion risk. At this time no magic concussion prevention solution exists.” \nFor now, unless something dramatic arises, Martin and the Pioneers will continue to strap on the Guardian Caps at practice. \n“I think anything that we can do to try to protect kids that’s reasonable, and it’s not going to cause them harm then we should try to do it if we have the ability to do it,” Martin said. \n“At the end of the day, is there a guaranteed that we’re not going to get a concussion? No. Is there a lesser of a chance? Probably.” 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1LtnCWo TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:04:55.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
