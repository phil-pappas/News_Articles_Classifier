They will return home to play at least two games of the best-of-seven series at Wrigley Field, starting Tuesday night.\nDaniel Murphy hit his fifth postseason homer off Arrieta to fuel a three-run first inning.\nCurtis Granderson led off with a single through the shift, and David Wright shook off a 1-for-19 postseason slump with an RBI double. Murphy followed with a two-run shot to right field that gave him a new team record for homers in a single postseason.\nGranderson denied Chris Coghlan of a homer in the second inning, making a leaping grab at the right-field fence.\nGranderson scored the Mets' fourth run in the third inning after a leadoff walk against Arrieta. He stole second and third and scored on an infield single from Yoenis Cespedes, whose hit came after the Cubs intentionally walked Murphy.\nMets rookie right-hander Noah Syndergaard pitched five scoreless innings until Kris Bryant broke through with an RBI double to left field in the sixth. Syndergaard gave up only that run on three hits over 5 2/3 innings.\nArrieta, who gave up four hits, walked two and struck out eight, suffered his first playoff loss after winning in his first two starts against the Pirates and Cardinals.\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1739845", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1739845&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1739845&h=Cubs+drop+Game+2+to+Mets%2C+4%2D1"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:39:32.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
