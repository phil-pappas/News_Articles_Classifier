That Trinity offensive line kind of did a number on us,\" Alumbaugh said. \"Our defense in general has improved quite a bit.\" \nThe numbers certainly back up Alumbaugh's statement. \nSince allowing 284 rushing yards and three touchdowns in the 26-21 loss to Trinity, the Spartans defense has not given up more than 137 yards on the ground in any game, including less than 55 in each of the past two games, and no rushing touchdowns. Driving the point home further, De La Salle has not allowed a point in the last 11 quarters it has played. \nThe Spartans (5-1) will face a stiff test Friday when they host Long Beach Poly (5-1) at 7:30 p.m. in De La Salle's highest profile game since its trip to Texas. MaxPreps.com has De La Salle ranked No. 4 in the state and Long Beach Poly No. 5. \n\"They are obviously really talented, really physical. They fly around quite a bit,\" said Alumbaugh about Long Beach Poly. \"Offensively, they have a lot of weapons.\" \nThe Jackrabbits have passed for 1,323 yards and run for 879 yards this season. They have two talented quarterbacks in junior Nolan McDonald (815 yards passing, 10 touchdowns) and Florida State commit Malik Henry (470 yards passing, four touchdowns in three games). Jack Jones has averaged 20.6 yards on his 23 receptions with six touchdowns. Advertisement \nOffensively, the Spartans have scored more than 35 points in each of their past five games. But they have also turned over the ball in five of their six games, and have lost 10 fumbles this season. \nBut De La Salle has no shortage of playmakers. For example, the Spartans had three players with more than 80 yards rushing against in a 48-0 victory over San Ramon Valley, including Antoine Custer with 88 yards on just five carries. \nDefensively, Devin Asiasi had a team-high five tackles and linebacker Keanu Andrade had two fumble recoveries and a sack against San Ramon Valley. The Spartans allowed the Wolves only 71 total yards. \nFriday will be the first time that the De La Salle and Long Beach Poly football teams have played each other since 2002. This year, everything worked out to stage another meeting between two of the state's most renowned high school programs. \n\"We had a few more openings, and we've always had a great relationship with Poly,\" Alumbaugh said. MVAL SHOWDOWN: There could be a fifth champion in five years in the Mission Valley Athletic League, and American's game with host Washington at 7 p.m. Saturday could determine the chances. American (5-1, 2-0 MVAL) is coming off wins over defending champion Kennedy and previously unbeaten Moreau Cahotlic (6-1, 1-1). The Eagles haven't won a league title since 1987, a stretch that could end with the help of dual-threat quarterback Junior Diala (six touchdowns passing, five on the ground) and defensive leaders Geordan Raines (60 tackles) and Aaron Bell (seven picks). \nWashington (4-2, 3-3) wants to recapture the magic of 2013, when it won the MVAL crown, behind running back Mark Colbert (671 yards, 10 touchdowns). Last year the Huskies were outlasted 13-7 by American in a double-overtime game. Returning the favor won't be Washington's last task, since Moreau visits Oct. 30. But Saturday's contest is crucial, for both squads. Staff writer Daniel Mano contributed to this notebook.
