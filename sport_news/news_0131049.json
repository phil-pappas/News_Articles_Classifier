Oklahoma football: Jordan Evans profile Spenser Davis, Football Reporter The Oklahoma Daily | 0 comments Posted on Oct 21, 2015 by Spenser Davis \nScott Evans was sitting in his living room on a brisk November afternoon in Norman, Oklahoma. \nThe Sooners were preparing to play in-state rival Oklahoma State, but Evans, a former three-time all-conference defensive tackle for OU, wasn’t focused on the game that night. \nHis son, Jordan, was on a recruiting visit with the Sooners. Jordan had not received any national recruiting attention — he lacked a power-five conference offer at the time — but he was still hopeful that he could play at a high level. \n“I was frustrated with it because I wanted (scholarship offers) now,” Jordan recalled. “I was probably being greedy, but I was working hard and wanted offers.” \nJordan finally received his scholarship offer from OU before Oklahoma’s eventual overtime victory over the Cowboys. \nScott was watching the day’s slate of college football games when he first learned that Jordan had been offered by Oklahoma. \n“I remember it pretty vividly,” Scott claims. “Some of the OU guys started reporting that OU had offered Jordan.” \n“As soon as he got home from the game he had a big smile on his face and we asked him what he was smiling about and that’s when he told us.” \nIt marked the end of a long, sometimes-frustrating recruiting process for the Evans family. Scott did what he could to help ease the pressure on his son. \n“I told him from the get-go, ‘wherever you decide to go to school, I’m for it,’” he said. “I always said ‘don’t go to OU because of me.’ I wanted him to go build his own path through life, and I wanted him to make his own roads.” \nDespite growing up the son of a Sooner legacy, Jordan wasn’t a fan of the Sooners when he was younger. Rather, he preferred Virginia Tech. \n“Michael Vick,” Jordan reasoned. “I loved watching him play.” \nBut Virginia Tech never showed any interest in Evans. \n“That was an offer he dreamed about,” Scott said. “But I told him ‘I don’t think Virginia Tech recruits anybody west of the Mississippi River.’ \n“That was way too far anyways. His mama would have had a heart attack.” \nThree days after receiving an offer from Oklahoma, Jordan met with his high school coach. Wade Stanley, then the head coach at Norman North and now at Ada, posed a question to the younger Evans. \nHe asked him if there was any other program he would consider playing for over Oklahoma. \n“No,” Evans replied. \nEvans entered his freshman campaign with a chip on his shoulder that stemmed from being under-recruited. \n“When you look at my school, not many guys were getting offers,” Jordan said. \"But when you look across the country and all these guys getting offers and they’re getting blown up — it just made me feel like ‘I’m not there,’ and it gave me drive to keep working harder.” \nBut then again, Evans did have a long way to go as an 18-year-old linebacker. \n“No, probably not,” Scott said when asked if he ever saw his son as a potential three-year starter at OU. \nIt wasn’t because he didn’t believe his son was talented or athletic enough. Rather, it was Jordan’s inexperience as a middle linebacker. \nIn high school, he was primarily featured as an outside linebacker. In Norman North’s 3-4 defense, that meant he spent a lot of time rushing the passer. \n“The first year and a half was really new for him, and he had to continue to work on a day-to-day basis just to try to get some of the nuances of the game down,” Scott said. \nAs a junior at OU, Evans is still finding ways to improve both physically and mentally at that position. \n“I think Jordan’s just kind of growing into his body and being able to see the game quickly, react to the game as a middle linebacker,” defensive coordinator Mike Stoops said. “It’s one of the toughest positions on the field to play. You have people coming at you, understanding, seeing plays, recognizing where you need to be, where your help is.” \nPerhaps no teammate has had a greater role in Evans’ development than Frank Shannon. \nShannon, OU’s leading tackler in 2013, was suspended for all of last season. Evans started all 13 games in his absence, but with Shannon returning for his senior season, Evans would have to compete for the starting role again. \n“I wondered when Frank came back how Jordan felt about it, but from the get-go he said he felt that if he did what he needed to do then he felt comfortable about it,” Scott said. \nAfter rotating series in the opening week against Arkon, Evans has seen nearly every first-team snap at inside linebacker alongside Dominique Alexander. \n“I feel like people had a lot of doubts about (Jordan). They thought Frank was going to come in. I felt like he did a really good job,” defensive end Matt Dimon said. \nEvans says that Shannon has been very supportive of him all season, pointing to a pair of moments against West Virginia and Tennessee where he helped him see things from the sidelines. \n“You saw what (Frank) did my freshman year, and I knew he was a great player,” Jordan said. “Frank is probably one of the most supportive guys that I know. As soon as I come off the sidelines he’s first off to me to either congratulate me or help me in something I need to do better in.” \nStill, it says something that it’s Shannon who is serving as Evans’ eyes from the sideline and not the other way around. \n“I always told him that it’s about effort and about knowing your responsibilities,” Scott said of his philosophy on earning playing time. “When I played, I wasn’t bigger, I wasn’t stronger and I wasn’t faster than anybody. I had to be a technician.” \nMost of this advice comes from Wednesday night dinners — something that Scott and Jordan try to share together, especially on game weeks. \n“I’m constantly reminding him about having urgency to the ball, playing hard, playing physical but always about playing smart,” Scott said. \nEvans is still developing his game at the division one level, but he is making progress. He’s currently the Sooners’ second leading tackler. \n“I like him a lot, but once you get him between those lines, he turns into a moster,” sophomore cornerback Jordan Thomas said. “He’s an animal.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:17:35.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
