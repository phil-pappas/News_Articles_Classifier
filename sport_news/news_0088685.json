Lions 26-23 in overtime on Saturday.\n\nEdmonton Eskimos' Dexter McCoil (45), centre, celebrates the win over the B.C. Lions during CFL action in Edmonton on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson. \nDexter McCoil picked off a pass in the second overtime session, allowing the Eskimos a clear chance to win it.\n\"It was an all-round team win there,\" said Whyte. \"The defence made amazing plays, got us into field goal range.\n\"It was a good day. The offence got us into short field-goal range. My mother could have made those ones.\"\nThe Eskimos (12-4) maintained first place in the West Division ahead of Calgary (12-4), which beat Toronto 27-15 earlier Saturday. Edmonton has won six games in a row for the first time since 2003.\n\"It was definitely a tough win ... it was definitely hard-fought,\" said Eskimos quarterback Mike Reilly. \"The reality is that we made this game a lot harder on ourselves than we needed to. Our defence played amazing again. Offensively, I've got to do a better job protecting the ball.\"\nThe Lions (5-10) have lost five of their last six games.\n\"It's a tough one to take,\" said Lions head coach Jeff Tedford. \"We have to give Edmonton credit for coming up with the win, but we shot ourselves in the foot when we had opportunities. It is frustrating. Our guys worked hard and played hard. There is not much you can say that is going to make anybody feel better when you don't come away with the win in a game like that.\"\nEdmonton took an early 3-0 lead on its first possession as a 63-yard Kendial Lawrence punt return eventually led to a 40-yard Whyte field goal.\nThe Lions came back to take the lead as Reilly tossed a pass straight into the waiting arms of Ronnie Yell and he waltzed just 13 yards into the end zone to make it 7-3.\nThe Eskimos had a field goal blocked, but came back on their next possession with a huge play as Reilly threw a long bomb to Adarius Bowman, who scampered the extra few yards to record a 69-yard touchdown to start the second quarter.\nB.C. tied the game five minutes into the second on a 14-yard Richie Leone field goal.\nThe teams traded field goals from there to make it 13-13 at the half.\nA 46-yard passing play to Derel Walker led to another Whyte field goal to start the third, putting Edmonton back in front.\nThe Lions got another huge play deep in Edmonton territory as a Reilly pass bounced out of the hands of one defender into another's. Alex Hoffman-Ellis took the interception to the three, setting up a passing TD from quarterback Jonathon Jennings to Manny Arceneaux. A missed convert made it 19-16 for B.C.\nEdmonton got a point back on a punt single before it appeared like the Lions were poised to put the game away with 10 minutes left in the fourth. However, on a first-and-one attempt, the ball was fumbled into the end zone and taken out by Edmonton defender Deon Lacey.\nThe Lions got a punt single, but Edmonton got one more late drive and Whyte kicked a 16-yarder to send the game to overtime tied 20-20.\nBoth teams hit field goals in overtime before Whyte connected on the winner â€” his sixth of the game.\nThe Lions return home to Vancouver to take on Hamilton next Friday, while the Eskimos head on the road to Saskatchewan next Saturday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:13:39.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
