(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- It’s odd to see a smile from a losing coach, but that’s exactly what appeared after the Class 2 District 9 championship volleyball game on Tuesdayat Cabool High School. Lady Bulldogs’ coach Angie Jester smiled as she described her squad’s performance, shortly following their defeat at the hands of the MV-BT/Liberty Lady Eagles in two sets.“I told them to make them earn it. If they (Liberty) were going to win, I wanted it to be something they had to fight for. And my girls stepped up and fought hard,” Jester said. “They’re fighters. It takes them awhile, but when they fight, they fight hard.” Liberty won the first set by a safe 25-15 margin, but the second set ended with a narrow Lady Eagles’ victory of 25-20. When asked to comment about the variance between the sets, Jester, who is in her 10th year at Cabool, simply replied, “We realized that we could play with them.” Lady Eagles’ coach Shari Tune also commented on the difference between the two sets.“During the second set we kind of let down a bit, which is what we’ve been doing all season, so we need to step up and work on that.” For Liberty, 5’7” senior Kaitlyn Raith, libero, led the team with 13 digs. Classmates Jessica Stretch and Johonna Walkup each had nine kills. For Cabool, 5’5” senior Kara Matherly had 12 digs, while 5’0” junior Alyssa Matherly had 10.“My libero (Raith) played very consistently all night and got some digs, which is something I like to see, and Brook Conway stood out,” said Tune. “She always plays consistently for us and she’s putting the ball where she needs to, to get kills.”“We got down during the second set, but finally fought back up and played better,” said Conway. Cabool, who entered the tournament as the 2 seed with a 17-10 record, defeated Plato in two sets in the first round then played a tight three sets with Willow Springs (20-11-1) in the second round, coming away with a victory. Liberty, as the 1 seed, earned a bye in the first round, then defeated Houston (11-15-3) in the second round in two sets. Liberty will face the Strafford Lady Indians (30-3-1) in semifinal action Saturday evening at the Strafford High School gymnasium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:38:37.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
