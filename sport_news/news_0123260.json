Swimming Seven current or past Cal swimmers were among the 36 athletes named to the Team USA squad for December's Duel in the Pool against a squad of European stars. \nCal senior Josh Prenot and former Bears Nathan Adrian and Tom Shields were named to the men's squad. Current Cal men's associate head coach Yuri Suguiyama will serve as an assistant for the U.S. Former Bears Natalie Coughlin, Missy Franklin, Caitlin Leverenz and Jessica Hardy were named to the women's squad. \nTeam USA includes 11 Olympic medalists, but gold medalists Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky, a Stanford recruit, are not competing at the event. Team Europe's roster will be announced next week. Barracuda Bryan Lerg and Scott Timmins scored first-period goals to give San Jose a 2-0 lead, but the San Diego Gulls rallied to force overtime and then scored the only goal in the shootout to send the Barracuda to a 3-2 American Hockey League loss.
