Definitely wanted to send this back to L.A.,\" Kershaw said. \"But yeah, it felt good to prove Donnie right and get that opportunity.\"\nPitching on three days' rest after he started Game 1 on Friday, Kershaw pitched seven innings of one-run ball, yielding just three hits with a walk and eight strikeouts. He threw 94 pitches, 19 shy of the total he threw in Game 1.\nKershaw, who struck out 301 batters during the regular season, stymied the Mets throughout the night. He didn't allow a hit until Daniel Murphy hit a one-out solo homer in the fourth.\nDespite how well Kershaw was pitching, Mattingly said there was no consideration about sending him back out for the eighth.\n\"The ball was still coming out of his hand good,\" Mattingly said. \"But at that point, we knew that was going to be it for him.\"\nKershaw already had given the Dodgers plenty to keep their season alive.\nKershaw often has struggled in the postseason, unable to carry over the dominance he typically shows during the regular season. Entering Tuesday, the 27-year-old was 1-6 with a 4.99 ERA in 12 playoff games (nine starts). And it's been the seventh inning in particular when some of his outings have come apart.\nIn Game 1 of the NLDS against the Cardinals last season, Kershaw allowed just two runs through the first six innings. In the seventh, St. Louis scored eight and knocked him from the game.\nThen he came back for Game 4 on three days' rest and pitched six shutout innings before yielding three runs in the bottom of the seventh.\nHe struggled again in the seventh in Game 1 on Friday. Kershaw allowed one run through the first six innings, then walked three batters in the seventh to set up David Wright's two-run single off Pedro Baez.\nYet in Game 4, he got out of the seventh unscathed.\n\"There's no curse or anything,\" Kershaw said of the seventh inning. \"Just got to get through it.\"\nYoenis Cespedes led off the inning with an infield single, then Travis d'Arnaud fouled out, Lucas Duda flied out, and Wilmer Flores grounded out to third. That was the final pitch Kershaw would throw. \n\"It was a good feeling to have your ace out there on the mound doing work,\" second baseman Howie Kendrick said.\nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:17:42.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
