The Czechs came in with a dominant lead early on, as goals from Pavel Kaderabek and Josef Sural put them 2-0 up inside half an hour. Although the visitors were reduced to 10 men when Marek Suchy was sent off before half-time, the Netherlands failed to capitalize.Instead, Robin van Persie, on as a substitute in the 38th minute, headed an own goal to put the result beyond doubt. The Netherlands could not come back from that, although Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Van Persie scored late consolation goals.It ended 3-2 to the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands has failed to qualify for the European competition for the first time since 1984. Czech Republic 3 - Netherlands 2 \n\"We have to look to the future now. This is very disappointing for the players, for me, for the Netherlands, but we have to look ahead, and the new goal is qualifying for the World Cup in Russia,\" said Danny Blind, Netherlands coach. In other matches, Belgium's 3-1 victory at home to Israel secured top spot in Group B, Latvia lost to Kazakhstan 1-0, Croatia's 1-0 win over Malta means it qualify as runner-up in Group H to Italy, which beat Norway 2-1, and Wales closed with a 2-0 win over Andorra.
