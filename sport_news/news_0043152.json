The power forward missed the rest of the season. \nRandle has looked impressive in training camp this month, averaging 12.8 points, 6.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists while playing an average of only 24.5 minutes in the Lakers' five preseason games. \nRandle will make $3.13 million this season. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:29:23.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
