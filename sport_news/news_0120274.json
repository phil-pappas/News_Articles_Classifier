(AP Photo/Patrick Record) \nMISSOULA — Montana running back John Nguyen had his back to his offensive teammates as they huddled near the Grizzly sideline, waiting out a TV timeout late in the fourth quarter. \nHis eyes were fixed on the Griz Vision scoreboard towering over Washington-Grizzly Stadium. Like the 25,014 fans in attendance, Nguyen couldn't stop watching the highlights of Makena Simis's day. \nThe Griz sophomore quarterback threw for six touchdowns in his first-ever start and Montana flew past visiting North Dakota on Saturday in a 42-16 Big Sky Conference final. \nSimis, the third man to start at quarterback this season and the third to win a football game, was surgical with his passes, throwing for 323 yards and the school-record-tying six scores. The QB came a long way from two weeks ago when he was pressed into relief duty because of injury, Montana head coach Bob Stitt said. \n\"He did a nice job checking protections when he needed it and he did a nice job of giving our receivers a chance,\" Stitt said. \"When people are playing man-to-man against you and you’ve got some nice threats outside, you just can’t throw the ball up and overthrow ‘em. He gave our guys a chance every single time and they made plays.\" \nThe play-making started early, though not in the Grizzlies' favor. Montana (3-1 in Big Sky, 4-3 overall) took the opening kickoff to near midfield, but a three-and-out meant North Dakota (2-3, 4-4) handled the ball with hardly a minute expired. On UND's first play, true freshman running back John Santiago sliced through the right side of the line and ran 80 yards untouched for a touchdown. \nThe silenced fans may have felt a sudden sickness coming on, but NoDak coach Bubba Schweigert wasn't ready to celebrate just yet. \n\"It's always good to get off to a good start in a tough place to play, but I just knew it was going to be a long game yet,\" he said. \nExcruciatingly so for the North Dakota travelers. \nSet up with excellent field position for a third straight time, Simis marched UM 54 yards in nine plays for a game-tying TD to Ben Roberts, a sign of things to come. \nNorth Dakota looked to reclaim its lead as the first quarter bled into the second. UND's powerful run game -- Santiago finished with a season-high 178 rushing yards -- carried UND into the red zone. Facing a first-and-goal from Montana's 5, two short runs went nowhere and Griz cornerback Nate Harris knocked away a pass on third down as the visitors settled for a 20-yard Reid Taubenheim field goal. \n\"I wouldn’t say it was a turning point, but I would say it did give us more confidence as a defense, to not let them score even though they got us on our heels,\" Griz linebacker Jeremiah Kose said. \nDespite the 10-7 lead, the drive showed a major weakness for North Dakota: an inability to pass. Ryan Bartels, a backup starting due to injury, threw for only 113 yards on 10 of 21 attempts. He entered the fourth quarter having completed just 5 of 14 with an interception, a pick by Kose. \nBartels did throw one TD, a garbage-time score to Luke Stanley that couldn't keep North Dakota from losing its third straight game. \nMontana wasted no time, almost literally, taking its first lead of the game just 39 seconds after UND's field goal. First Simis hit Jamaal Jones for a 26-yard gain and then, after a short run by Nguyen, Simis put a floater into the right corner that Ellis Henderson nabbed over the defender's head. \nStarting with that touchdown, which gave UM a 14-10 lead about 5 minutes before halftime, Montana scored 35 straight points against a UND team allowing only 22.7 per game, third best in the Big Sky. \nSimis -- a starter in place of Chad Chalich who was in place of Brady Gustafson -- visited Henderson again on Montana's next drive, that scoring strike covering 63 yards. Nguyen picked up a blitz from the left and Simis threw rolling to his right and let Henderson do the rest. \n\"I just felt comfortable. We knew they were going to bring a lot of dudes (on blitzes) and our O-line did a great job of picking that up,\" Simis said. \"I felt like I could just sit back there.\" \nHe continued to in the third quarter. A third straight Griz possession ended in the end zone -- excluding a one-play kneel-down to end the half -- when Simis found Josh Horner from 12 yards to make it 28-10 and give the Griz their then-largest lead of the season. \nTwo drives later Jones checked in with his first of two TDs, a 74-yarder as he broke two tackles and ran 60 yards unaccounted for. \n\"Obviously they're pretty good at those positions, but we need to do better,\" UND's Schweigert said. \"We need to stay on top of routes. We've got to take that as personal battles. Corner is a tough position to play in this league, but we just plain ol' have to do better.\" \nJones's 22-yarder to cap Montana's scoring on the first play of the fourth quarter gave him 139 yards on the day and five TDs for the year, a mark both Henderson and Roberts hit earlier in the day. Henderson had 114 yards as well, the first time the duo has reached the plateau together since a season-opening win over North Dakota State. \nMontana's 42 points is its most scored this year, surpassing the 38 from that day in late August as well. \n\"I was talking to the other coaches on the head sets, I didn’t know what to do with myself in the fourth quarter where it wasn’t a nail-biter and you’re all stressed out trying to figure out a way to pull something off,\" joked Stitt, whose team hadn't played in a game in 2015 separated by more than 14 points until Saturday. \n\"It was nice to have this thing under control and the kids go out and play the way we knew they could play.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:27:07.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
