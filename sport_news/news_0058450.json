He will provide much needed leadership and strategic direction for our future. Matt has the ability to evaluate problems and find solutions. He is a Kamiakin High and Eastern Washington University graduate, college professor, nuclear cybersecurity project manager, and a small business owner. \nRecently retiring as an Army lieutenant colonel after serving 21 years, he still serves local area veterans as a lifetime member and past president of American Legion Post 4 and Veterans of Foreign Wars, and legislative liaison for the Military Officer Association Lewis & Clark Chapter. All this and he still volunteers his free time for the Kennewick School District and Bethlehem Lutheran Church. \nMatt has been an energetic, positive and loyal leader for our country and the city for more than 35 years, serving three years as Kennewick arts commissioner and the Tri City Water Follies Air Show director. He has given his time, talents and personal finances to help grow our community into one of the best in the state. \nMatt has my vote and deserves yours also. Let Matt work for you! \nAnita McDaniel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:14:28.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
