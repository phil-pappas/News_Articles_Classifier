Before the pick, the Colts had the ball at the Saints ' 18-yard line.\nLuck had an ugly first half against New Orleans, completing only 9 of 19 passes for 79 yards, along with the two picks. \nThe Colts trailed the Saints 20-0 at the half. \nLuck had a decent second half that included three touchdown passes, but it wasn't enough to bring the Colts back. Luck threw for 333 yards and three touchdowns in the loss. Andrew Luck heard some boos on Sunday.
