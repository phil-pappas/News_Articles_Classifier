Kane for Shaw Media. By DENNIS NELSON Shaw Media Correspondent \nBOLINGBROOK – Efficiency was the buzz word during Bolingbrook’s 68-6 SouthWest Suburban Blue win Friday over Joliet Central. Related Links Lockport pulls away to beat Stagg \nThe Raiders (4-3, 2-2) scored 48 points on 21 plays for the first quarter and a half. During that span, the Steelmen (0-7, 0-5) had minus-4 yards of offense on 17 plays. \n“Our goals were to get win No. 4 and to start preparing for Lockport next week because it’s a must-win game for us,” Bolingbrook coach John Ivlow said. \nA win at home against Lockport would make Bolingbrook playoff eligible. \n“Next week will give us five wins and with our points, we should be able to make the playoffs,” Ivlow said. \nEight different Raiders reached pay dirt. In the first half, Jeremiah Lebron ran for touchdowns of 3 and 10 yards, and Jaylen Griffin ran for scores of 7 and 36 yards. \nJazontae Howard (50-yard run), Deangelo Colon (46-yard catch), Lucas Warren (3-yard run) and Kendall Smith (68-yard catch) also had first-half touchdown plays. Both touchdown passes came from Michael Freeze. \n“We took a step forward except for the first two series,” Ivlow said. “We turned the ball over and had a few penalties. But a few guys gave us a spark and we took off from there.” \nCentral averted a shutout when Malek Harden scored from 1 yard out with 2:17 left in the first half. \n“We’re at the point in the season when our guys are battling, we have a lot of backups in there and we need to prepare them better as a coaching staff,” Central coach Brett Boyter said. “You have to give Bolingbrook a lot of credit. They are a good team and they are much better than their record shows. They are going to give H-F a heck of a game when they see them.” \nThe Steelmen’s second-quarter touchdown drive was set up by runs of 33 and 26 yards by Ernst Grant. Malek Harden also ran 13 yards to the Raiders’ 1. \nScoring second-half touchdowns for Bolingbrook were Sammy Nasca (6-yard run) and Deshawn Battle (11-yard run). \nCentral’s Robert Ogden was taken off the field on a golf cart after the Raiders’ first touchdown with 7:14 remaining in the first quarter. \n“A lot of that was precautionary,” Boyter said. “He was conscious and alert. We’ll find out soon what his condition is and move forward from there.” \nThe victory gives Bolingbrook back-to-back wins for the first time this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:03:17.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
