(Dhoni sets world record) JP Duminy is ecstatic after winning the game for South Africa \n\"Definitely one of my best innings. The way we started the innings was what we wanted in the chase. We batted quite well in the middle and built a good partnership with fudge(Behardien). We both said we have to take it on, we don't want to die wondering towards the end,\" Duminy said at the post-match presentation ceremony. (Who is Aravind?) \nThe Proteas needed just 10 runs off the last over which was bowled by left-arm pacer Sreenath Aravind. \nAfter a few good deliveries in the block-hole, Aravind missed his line and Duminy clobbered him into the stands for a huge six, thus killing off the contest. \n\"We knew if we could get it down to 10-11 off the last over, we had a good chance. Fortunately enough, the left-armer missed his lengths and gave me an opportunity. It's a long tour for us but we have started well and we are happy with this performance,\" he said. \nIANS Read more about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:59:41.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
