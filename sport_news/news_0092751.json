They're winning a lot of games for us on the defensive side I think. As soon as we figure out a way to score some more goals, I think we'll be in better shape and make things less stressful for me.” \nOn Monday, Casey Pine scored the lone goal for Oceanside with 39:26 left in the second half, off an assist by Kelsey Brooks. \nOceanside held a 19-5 edge in shots, 1-0 advantage in indirect kicks, 3-1 edge in direct kicks and 7-2 advantage in corner kicks. \nKayln Grover made five saves in goal for the Mariners, while Hillary Libby made 18 saves in net for the Black Raiders. \nTownsend said the team's defense is led by Gabby Simmons, Emma Lee, Lauren Hatch and Becca Boggs, though Boggs injured her knee at Waterville and may sit out the rest of the regular season. Haylee Witham has played well in Boggs' absence, said Townsend. \nGrover also is the team's goalie and has played well, though Townsend added Oceanside's top-notch defensive unit has made her job a bit easier. \n“It's the defenders out in front of her that are shutting down offensive players,” said Townsend. “And not letting the offensive players on other teams get great looks at the goal. They're also not giving up a lot of dead balls, meaning directs or indirects around our goal or corner kicks. When teams get those looks I think the chances go up.” \nOffensively, identical twin sisters Kelsey and Jillian Brooks — along with cousin Makenna Brooks — have been stalwarts, as has Pine. Freshman Hope Butler also has had quality chances for the Mariners, including scoring both goals at Waterville. \n“We've just been trying to mix things up a little bit and try to play to the few strengths we have,” said Townsend. “We don't have a ton of them to be honest, but the kids are just finding a way.” \nThe Mariners have four game remaining on the year — all at home — against Lincoln Academy of Newcastle, Nokomis of Newport, Mount View of Thorndike and Belfast. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Oceanside (9-0-1, 87.2449 points) is first in the 18-team region. The top 12 teams qualify for the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:08:53.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
