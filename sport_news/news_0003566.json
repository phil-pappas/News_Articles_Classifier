A victory against SKC and the Galaxy will secure second place for the upcoming MLS Playoffs and avoid the Knockout Round, single-elimination game, which would take place either Wednesday or Thursday.\nAs the second seed, the Galaxy would begin the playoffs in the conference semifinals (Nov. 1 and 8) in a home-and-home, aggregate goal series.\nA loss or draw today and the Galaxy could fall to fifth in the conference. Only three points separate the Galaxy and SKC in the standings, but with all of the games involving Western Conference games starting at the same time (4 p.m. PST), clarity will not come until late in the evening.\n“It’s going to be a tough game, but it’s in our hands,” Galaxy forward Robbie Keane said. “We still have a chance to go in there and get three points, and still claim that second spot. The good thing about football is that there is always another game.”\nUp until the last month of the season, the Galaxy appeared to be favorites to win the Western Conference.\nFrom July 4 to Aug. 23, the Galaxy posted a 6-1 record to jump to the top of the conference. However, over the past six games, the Galaxy has managed a record of 1-3-2.\n“Take away (last) Sunday’s game (a 5-2 loss to Portland), we haven’t been too bad,” Keane said. “We’ve obviously been conceding goals, but as a group we have to attack as a group and defend as a group. You win nothing if you don’t defend as a group.”\nWhat is troubling to the Galaxy has been its performance on the road this season. The Galaxy has a 2-8-6 road record, while SKC has a posted a 9-2-5 record at home.\nGalaxy defender Omar Gonzalez isn’t concerned about the club’s recent road woes, just about taking care of business today.\n“We can go to Kansas City and play as hard as we can, fight with everything and get the result we need,” Gonzalez said.\nContact the writer: dcalhoun@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:08:00.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
