League Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the agreement \"marks an important step in our long-term international growth.\"\"Fans in the U.K. have responded incredibly well to the regular-season games we have played in London since 2007,\" Goodell added. \"We think it's time to expand our International Series to other countries and respond to the growing interest in our game not only in the U.K., but elsewhere around the world.\"A schedule of internationally hosted games for 2016 is expected to be announced later this year, with the U.K. and other nations in contention to host games. \nCopyright   Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 4:41PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:33:43.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
