Tuaua and freshman receiver Andre Petties-Wilson posted bond, and Patterson said he is waiting for the facts to play out.\nBut his reference to Baylor did nothing but add fuel to a fiery rivalry that has escalated quickly between two of the top-five ranked teams in the country.\n\"All I care [about] is a 50-50 deal,\" Patterson said at his weekly news conference. \"In this kid's case, Mike Tuaua, we'll find out what the facts are. It'll all come out. I just hope when they all come out, you report it just as strongly as what you've done here because it's not even close to what happened south of here.\"\nThat was an obvious reference to the Baylor case involving Sam Ukwuachu, who was convicted of sexually assaulting a fellow student after having had a tainted past at Boise State before transferring to Baylor.\nPatterson's comparison immediately drew wide criticism on social media.\nThe coach added that Tuaua had suffered a partially torn ligament before the season opener against Minnesota, the only game in which he has played this season. He started five games last season and was viewed as a foundation piece of the defense coming into the season and as such was named a captain by Patterson.\nPatterson said that a decision would have had to be made this week on whether Tuaua would redshirt because of the injury. But that is a moot point until the legal issue is resolved. Injuries have decimated the Frogs on the defensive side of the ball.\nThe coach also said that Tuaua will not play for the Frogs until the legal process is complete.\nAfter comparing the situation to the one in Waco, Patterson came to the defense of his player.\n\"I'm just going to tell you something right now when it comes to Mike Tuaua,\" Patterson said. \"I named him captain, but outside [of football] in our community, with kids, he's the most-liked kid we have on our team beside [quarterback] Trevone Boykin.\"\nPatterson said he's willing to let the situation play out. He was hopeful that it would be addressed by the school last week, but it wasn't.\n\"I'm just telling you, as far as just a person, I'm not going to let you say this kid's a bad person,\" Patterson said. \"If he made a mistake, he made a mistake, OK? \"\nPatterson went on to say that in his 15 years at TCU he has never felt compelled to stick up for a player involved in controversy.\n\"There's a bunch of stuff I can't talk about,\" Patterson said. \"My job is the football coach. But I would say this. When we've had things go on, you've never heard me ever speak up for a kid if he screwed up. But you did now.\"\nThe legal problem, which didn't become public until two weeks after Tuaua was suspended, for the moment has overshadowed what will be TCU's stiffest test of the season Saturday at Texas Tech (3-0).\nOn Twitter:\n @ESefko", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ESefko"], "published": "2015-09-22T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:42:54.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
