(Getty Images) \nIt's still early, but with nearly every team having completed five games, the NFL season is almost a third of the way done. And it has been one of the most unusual starts to a season we've ever seen. \nThere are six undefeated teams and only one winless team, which means that the middle class of the league is as big as ever. Nearly every team still has some viable chance of making the postseason, which of course means that some of those teams in the mix are surprising additions. One case of a surprise team that seems well on their way to the playoffs would be the 5-0 Falcons, who were just 10-22 over the previous two years. \nDan Quinn will likely get the Falcons to the playoffs in his first season, but which surprise teams still chasing down first place in their division or a wild card will be able to remain in the hunt and seal the deal? Here are a few of the most compelling arguments, ordered from least likely to most likely to still be playing in January. Raiders (2-3) and Browns (2-3), AFC Wild Card \nThe Raiders and Browns have been surprisingly competitive this season, with Cleveland securing a 33-30 overtime win over the Ravens this week, while Oakland lost a close game to the Broncos. The good news for both of them is that they are far from out of the wild card chase, as the current leader for the last playoff spot is the 3-2 Bills. \nThat's just a one game lead by a team that hasn't made the playoffs since 1999. So there is plenty of time to make up a small amount of room, but can either of these teams make a shocking postseason run? \nNo, probably not. \nThe Browns started 3-2 in each of the last two seasons and missed the playoffs. Their next five games are against the Broncos, at Rams, Cardinals, at Bengals, at Steelers. They might be 3-7 by the end of that. The Raiders lost by two to the Bears last week and those are the types of games that they can't lose if they want to turn around the last decade-plus of sucktitude. Titans (1-3), Texans (1-4), and Jaguars (1-4), AFC South \nThat's just how bad the AFC South is and how uninteresting the Colts are this season â€¦ at least when Andrew Luck is starting. \nThe Titans have the most realistic chance of taking the division from Indy, but blew an opportunity to beat the Bills this week, which would have put them at 2-2. There is just a very good chance that the winner of this division could be .500 or worse, and that's right in Tennessee and Houston's wheelhouse. Redskins (2-3), NFC East \nKirk Cousins, playoff quarterback? It might not be that crazy after all. \nThat's due to the fact that the NFC East is one Eli Manning play away from having a four-way tie at 2-3. Instead it's led by the 3-2 Giants, hardly a significant obstacle to worry about. So why can't it be the Redskins? \nThey nearly pulled off an upset in Atlanta on Sunday, but if they want to be considered legit contenders, they'll need to find ways to close out games like those. They play at the Jets in Week 6, then at the Patriots in Week 9. \nMost likely, they'll find themselves picking in the top 10 in the draft again. Bears (2-3), Bucs (2-3), and Rams (2-3), NFC Wild Card \nIf Washington doesn't win the NFC East, could they stay in the wild card hunt? Why not, as it seems very possible that an 8-8 team could be getting a wild card berth this season, if not more than one. \nThe current leader after five weeks for the sixth and final playoff spot are the 2-2 Minnesota Vikings. There are seven 2-3 teams in the NFC alone. \nThat includes Chicago (5-11 last year), St. Louis (6-10), and Tampa Bay (2-14), who haven't necessarily improved a ton but are presented an opportunity to remain competitive in December, which is not something that most of the coaches or players on these rosters are familiar with. That inexperience could make it difficult for them to keep pace with other 2-3 teams like the Seahawks, Cowboys (when Tony Romo returns), and Vikings. Vikings (2-2), NFC Wild Card \nDespite a lot of playoff appearances in the last 35 or so years, the Vikings haven't actually made the Super Bowl since 1976. Most people wouldn't expect them to do that this season, but it does appear that Mike Zimmer has a good shot at getting his team to the playoffs in his second year as head coach. \nAnd it will be a damn shame if they don't win the next five games and set themselves up for a showdown in the NFC North. \nMinnesota's next five after this week's bye are against the 1-4 Chiefs, 0-5 Lions, 2-3 Bears, 2-3 Rams, and 2-3 Raiders. The Vikings are better than all of those teams, and the expected goal should be for them to stand at 7-2 as they prepare to play the Packers in Minnesota. \nThe return of Adrian Peterson has put the Vikings at the top of the league in yards per carry, while Harrison Smith, Anthony Barr, and Everson Griffen are some of the best young defensive players in the NFL. I don't think that Teddy Bridgewater is ready to unseat Aaron Rodgers in the North, but they were a popular preseason sleeper pick for a reason. \nWill that Week 1 loss to the 49ers come back to haunt them in the final weeks of the season? Jets (3-1), Bills (3-2), AFC East or AFC Wild Card \nThe Jets may have fired \"defensive guru\" Rex Ryan, but in doing so and hiring Todd Bowles, they are playing defense as the 2009-2010 era team. That has some people wondering if New York can't just get to the playoffs, but give the Patriots a run for the money in the division. \nThe biggest test there comes in two weeks, when the Jets play the Pats in New England. Pull off the upset there, and the rest of the schedule lightens up really quick as they have games against the Redskins, Raiders, Jaguars, Texans, Dolphins and Titans on the horizon. \nMeanwhile, the Bills would need to get really lucky to win the division, especially after already losing to the Pats at home, but their 16-year playoff drought could still end. They've got two more games against the AFC South and three more against the NFC East, the two worst divisions in football. Tyrod Taylor's passing game has been uneven, but his 76 rushing yards with a touchdown on Sunday showed he's dangerous as a playmaker. \nBuffalo should get the last wild card spot, with the Jets in the mix for the other (if not even the division itself).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:19:14.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
