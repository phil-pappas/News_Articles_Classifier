He had been the Angels assistant GM since November 2011. \nKlentak replaces Ruben Amaro Jr. He was fired in September by new team president Andy MacPhail. \nKlentak previously worked for MacPhail in Baltimore as the Orioles director of baseball operations from 2008-11. He then served as the No. 2 man behind GM Jerry DiPoto for four seasons. Klentak interviewed for DiPoto's job after he resigned this summer. The Angels hired Billy Eppler earlier this month. \nKlentak began his career in the majors as a front-office intern with Colorado. He then worked in Major League Baseball's Labor Relations Department until MacPhail first hired him in March 2008. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:08:21.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
