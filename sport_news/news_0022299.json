By THOMAS KUEBEL - editorial@kcchronicle.com \nST. CHARLES – One of the main differences in tennis between singles and doubles is that in the singles game, long rallies are much more common. This was the case Saturday at the St. Charles East Sectional, as Elgin freshman Marta Krakowski made tedious work of Geneva junior Grace Krueger to win the singles championship. \nSt. Charles North coach Sean Masoncup pointed out the same thing, observing, “The singles game is a lot more counterpunching and slower-developing. Most of the points will go very quickly, but they are long. I think that has a lot to do with it, but the pace of the doubles is really where it gets going.” \nMasoncup and North know a thing or two about doubles. The North Stars earned the sectional title behind two entries who'll compete in the IHSA state tournament that begins Thursday at various District 211, 214 and 220 courts. \nFor the record, the North duo of Emma Spellman and Shelby Thomas defeated teammates Morgan Rerko and Brittany Rohrsen for the title, but both pairings are optimistic about their chances at state. \n“Its very exciting that all four of us got to make it,” Rerko said. “I’m excited for what’s to come, and I’m proud of what we did this weekend.” \nThe Kane County Chronicle area will be well-represented on the doubles circuit at state, as the host Saints qualified the duos of Paige Ackerman and Emily Sullivan (third) and Sonia Ost and Jenna Patzner (fourth). \nKrueger, a junior, also advanced. Shad no trouble in her Friday matches of the two-day event, dropping only two games in her first four sets. She galloped into the finals matches on Saturday with a smile and determination to continue making a name for herself after earning a second=place finish. \n“It was a new experience because I usually play for third (singles) because [recent graduate Kirby Einck] usually played for first,” Krueger said. “I just want to do better than I did last year and freshman year\" at state. \nMasoncup has high expectations for his pairings saying, “I think they are both in the conversation for top 32 as well as Grace. So the Tri-Cities contingent will hopefully be well represented.” \nEast, whose four doubles athletes are seniors, also is giddy about its opportunity after holding serve on its home courts. \n“We have a nice set up with the courts. They were just redone two years ago,” Saints coach Matt Bulman said. \nBulman was especially in a group of state qualifiers who were not the favorites coming into the tournament. \n“The fact that we got two of them, two doubles teams, four kids going to state is awesome,” Bulman said. “That was their goal at the start of the season and they accomplished it. Everything else from here on out is just bonus.” \nThe packed house of spectators filled the rollaway bleachers and the top row of the Norris Stadium steps for an overview of all active courts with matches going on. Many fans received a workout of their own, spinning their heads left and right or back and forth trying to keep up with action, especially in the singles events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:59:39.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
