A lot can change in a short amount of time, though. The Astros have since moved on to have success in the American League West, while the Pirates and Cubs spent 2015 putting together the second and third best records in all of baseball, respectively, and earning themselves spots in Wednesday night's Wild Card game. For the second straight year, though, Gerritt Cole and the Pirates could not handle the opposing team's ace, and were eliminated from the post season by Jake Arrieta and the Chicago Cubs in a 4-0 shutout. In front of the largest single-game crowd in PNC Park history, Cole struggled on the mound, while the rest of the Pirates lineup failed to solve Arrieta, who extended his winning streak to 12 games, giving up only 4 hits and striking out 11 in his complete game shutout. Cole, on the other hand, gave up 6 hits, 4 runs and struck out 4 in 5 innings of work. The Pirates generated some offense in the sixth and seventh innings, but two double plays spoiled any hope for the Bucs to get on the board. Many left PNC Park upset over the loss, but that does not include the men in the Pirates clubhouse. While disappointment was certainly prominent, the Bucs preferred to focus on winning 98 games, and doing it with this group of guys, especially AJ Burnett and Aramis Ramirez, who are hanging up the cleats at the conclusion of this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:09:25.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
