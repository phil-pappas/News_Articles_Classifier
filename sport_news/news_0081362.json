(WYMT) -- Kentucky will look to win its first game over Mississippi State since 2008 when they won in Starkville by one (14-13). \nState has spent the last two weeks out of the SEC. The 'Dogs beat Sun Belt Conference opponent Troy with 45 points, and then they scored 45 more against Conference USA opponent Louisiana Tech. Regardless, head coach Mark Stoops thinks this game won't be easy. \n\"I believe it will be the greatest challenge we've had all year. It is going to be a great environment against a very mature, good football team that has an unbelievable guy back there taking snaps and a great coaching staff and a group that is used to winning a bunch of games. It is going to be a real challenge for us. Believe we are double-digit underdogs. It is going to be a fight.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:51:38.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
