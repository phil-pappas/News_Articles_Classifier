But it went really pretty well. We had our band and our dance team there and all the guys on the football team.” \nA half-dozen special-needs children participated in the camp and got to score a touchdown with the high school team blocking for them. Rowe estimated that about 100 Rocori students participated. \n“It was blown away with our kids,” Rowe said. “They really shined. \n“The (special-needs) kids took to the same players that we as coaches admire. It was pretty rad to watch them all score.” \nThe Spartans (5-3) now prepare for Little Falls (2-6). The teams last met in the playoffs in 2013. Rocori won 24-21. \nThe Spartans are defending section champions. Like last year, they were the third seed and wound up winning the section. \n“Rocori’s going to win that section,” St. Cloud Tech head coach Gregg Martig said. “And you can quote me on that.” \nSeedings for all sections in the state were finalized Saturday. Many teams, anticipating where the QRF ratings of the Minnesota-Scores.Net website would place them, had already traded game films. \n“You can’t wait until Saturday morning to prepare for a Tuesday game,” Martig said. “If something had changed (in the seedings) overnight, that would have been really interesting.” \nSections 8-5A, 6-5A, 8-4A and 7-2A open play Tuesday and have semifinals Saturday with their championships scheduled for Oct. 22 or 23. \nSartell and St. Cloud Apollo are in 8-5A. Sauk Rapids and Tech are in 6-5A. Rocori and Little Falls are in 8-4A and Royalton plays in 7-2A. \n“We’re happy to be seeded fifth and to have a 4-4 record,” said Sauk Rapids head coach Bill Magnuson, whose squad plays at 7 p.m. Tuesday at No. 4 Elk River (4-4). “We’re not seeded last and that’s a good feeling, too.” \nSections 6-4A, 5-3A, 6-3A, 5-2A and 4A play first-round games Wednesday, then have their semifinals Oct. 20 and their finals scheduled for Oct. 24. \nBecker is in 6-4A and got the second seed behind Orono. \nBecker is 8-0, ranked No. 1 in the state in Class 4A by The Associated Press and the defending state champion on a 20-game winning streak. Bulldogs head coach Dwight Lundeen was resigned to his team’s seedings fate. \n“We play 3A teams and they play 5A teams,” Lundeen said Thursday. “I’m not sure we can get it (No. 1) even if they lose.” \nOrono (8-0) beat Waconia the next night, 50-17. Orono beat four 5A schools, including Waconia, Bloomington Kennedy, Bloomington Jefferson and Chanhassen. Becker plays No. 5 schools. \nPierz is the top seed in 5-3A and Albany got No. 1 in 6-3A, despite losing 42-6 to Becker. \nFollow Tom Elliott on Twitter @sctimestom or call 259-3661. \nFootball pairings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:22:26.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
