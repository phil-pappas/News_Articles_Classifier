It's unclear.\nNow Ohio State invites Penn State into Ohio Stadium on Saturday night for a nationally-televised game. The Buckeyes are going to wear all-black uniforms and the crowd is expected to wear black for a \"Dark Night In The Shoe.\"\nCould this be setting up to be national statement the Buckeyes, who are 17-point favorites, have yet to make?\nHere's what we think:\nDoug Lesmerises picks Ohio State 35, Ohio State 24\nBoth offenses should move the ball against good defenses and score, but not go crazy. Expect a competitive game into the second half and maybe some nervous Ohio State fans in the third quarter at Ohio Stadium. In the end, it's a comfortable win - so game-tying passes into the endzone on the last play - but not a rout.\nBill Landis picks Ohio State 28, Penn State 13\nI'm not totally convinced Ohio State's offense has figured things out just yet, Penn State's defense will tell us if that's actually the case.\nThings won't come as easily against Penn State as they did against Maryland, which is why I think this is a close game into the fourth quarter before Ohio State pulls away because it still has more talent, and Penn State's offense doesn't have the weapons to keep up.\nAri Wasserman picks Ohio State 42, Penn State 17\nIt's getting to the point in the season where Ohio State has got to prove it can play at a national title-like level, so why not against Penn State?\nThough the Nittany Lions have a solid defense, I'm not sure they are as good as this big game atmosphere indicates. So if Ohio State shows up like it did last year for the Michigan State game, it may come out with its most convincing game of the season.\nSeason\nStraight up: Ari (6-0), Bill (6-0), Doug (5-1)\nAgainst the spread: Bill (4-2), Ari (4-2), Doug (2-4)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:50:52.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
