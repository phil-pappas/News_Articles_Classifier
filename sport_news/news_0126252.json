I really would.\"\nSince her condition prevents her from working, she manages to live on less than $700 a month and can’t afford to watch the games, let alone attend. However, this hasn’t stopped her from keeping up with the team and enjoying the possible ride to the World Series.\nIf you would like to help Jeter get season tickets for next year or possible 2015 World Series tickets, click here  to donate.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
