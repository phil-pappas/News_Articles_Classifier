Both teams really struggled with field conditions in this one.It was 14 to 9 at the half.Irish on offense; Alex Daras hands it to Alex Breakers and he puts the ball on the ground and the field grabs a tight hold.East Ridge trying to scoop, but just couldn't get a hold. Both offenses stalling.East Ridge about to punt, and Andrew Banks is going to field this at the 2, and you know he messed up putting his team in the hole. Pioneers looking for the safety, and the Irish give it to Ricky Ballard, who is lucky to have even made it outside of the end zone before being met by a group of Pioneers.East Ridge now on offense.Eric Bennet tosses the screen pass to Dominique Millener, who makes one, misses, makes another miss before finally being dragged down for a big 25 yard gain.That drive stalled, leading to a field goal attempt.But with the wet ball and the muddy field, it falls way short of the mark.Score still 14 to 9, Irish. With one last chance in closing minutes, Daras throws to Andrew Banks and its incomplete.East Ridge pulls out a squeaker, 14 to 9 win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:55:04.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
