AL DIAZ MIAMI HERALD STAFF Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin leaves the field at the end of the NFL football game between the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins and at Wembley stadium in London, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015. The Jets won the match 27-14. Tim Ireland AP 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story \nThe Miami Dolphins have fired head coach Joe Philbin, marking the end of a 52-game run in which the team was perennially mediocre. \nThe Miami Herald has confirmed multiple reports of Philbin's ouster. The team is expected to announced the firing and the hiring of tight end coach Dan Campbell as the interim head coach later Monday, per a source. \nPhilbin's undoing came the past three weeks when his team failed to not only win but even play up to competitive expectations. The Dolphins were upset by Jacksonville and then lost bitter decisions to Buffalo and the New York Jets. \nPhilbin said Sunday evening after losing to New York that he was not worried about his job security. He should have been. \nAccording to a source, owner Stephen Ross decided to fire Philbin on his jet flight back from England to the United States and informed the coach Monday morning of the news. \nThe Dolphins released statements from Ross and Philbin to announce the firing. \n“This was a tough decision for me to make knowing how tirelessly Joe worked in his four years here to make this a winning team,\" Ross said. \"He is a man of the highest character and integrity that I developed a close personal relationship with. \n\"I am extremely disappointed with how we have started the season, but I feel confident that we can improve quickly with the talent we have on our roster. We will soon be announcing an interim coach to lead the team going forward.\" \nRoss should blame himself for the team's current state. He saw the team’s substandard play late last season and rewarded Philbin with a contract extension for the failure. \nThat wasn't Philbin's fault. That was on Ross, who now will be part of a coaching search at the end of the season that is likely to be different than others he has conducted. This one will primarily be headed by executive vice president Mike Tannenbaum. \nPhilbin, for his part, will be paid through next season even though he will not be coaching the Dolphins. Always classy in his time with Miami, he remained so in his statement. \n“I want to thank Steve Ross for allowing me the privilege to serve as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins,\" Philbin said. \"This is a tremendous organization from top to bottom that has a talented and dedicated staff. I want to especially thank the players, coaches and football staff who have worked so unselfishly and represented the team with dignity and class. \n\"I would be remiss if I didn’t thank the incredible fan base who has supported me and my family unconditionally since day one. It is my hope that the 2015 Miami Dolphins achieve great success both on and off the field.\" Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:39:08.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
