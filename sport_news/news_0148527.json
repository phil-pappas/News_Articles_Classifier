The Maple Leafs had a chance to clear the rebound but failed, leaving it for Galchenyuk.\nMontreal defenseman P.K. Subban picked up his second assist of the game on the goal.\nLeft winger Max Pacioretty scored two goals for the Canadiens, notching a first-period goal and a third-period marker into an empty net in the final minute.\nLeft winger James van Riemsdyk scored for the Maple Leafs in the opening seconds of the second period to tie the game.\nIt was the first game as coach of the Maple Leafs for Mike Babcock, the former Detroit Red Wings coach.\nGoaltender Carey Price made 36 saves in the Montreal goal while Maple Leafs goaltender Jonathan Bernier made 27 saves.\nMontreal opened the scoring at 3:09 of the first period on a goal by Pacioretty, whose shot bounced off Bernier's right shoulder before trickling over the line. Subban picked up his first assist of the game.\nVan Riemsdyk was stationed in the slot when he deflected a shot from the top of the left faceoff circle by center Nazem Kadri to tie the game at 19 seconds of the second period.\nThe power-play goal came six seconds after Montreal right winger Brendan Gallagher was penalized for goaltender interference. Defenseman Dion Phaneuf also earned an assist on the goal.\nMontreal had a goal nullified nearly seven minutes into the second for incidental contact with the goaltender. The review was the result of a Maple Leafs challenge.\n(Edit by Julian Linden)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:15:20.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
