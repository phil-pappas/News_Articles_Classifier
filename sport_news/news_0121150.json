It looks like Joe Philbin's days are numbered as Miami's coach. Jets 20, Dolphins 13.\nRAIDERS (2-1)\nAT BEARS (0-3)\nNoon Sunday, CBS-2\nRaiders by 3 (O/U 44 1/2)\nThe Bears are a mess, and now they're starting to break up their team. The Raiders are starting to gather some momentum behind QB Derek Carr and an upgraded receiving corps. Raiders 27, Bears 20.\nJAGUARS (1-2)\nAT COLTS (1-2)\nNoon Sunday\nColts by 9 (O/U 48)\nThe Colts haven't ironed out their problems, and Andrew Luck has yet to get on track. But the Jaguars just aren't very good, and the Colts, fortunate to be in the AFC South, pick up their second win. Colts 28, Jaguars 24.\nGIANTS (1-2)\nAT BILLS (2-1)\nNoon Sunday\nBills by 5 1/2 (O/U 45 1/2)\nThe Giants hoped to get Victor Cruz back, but they won't. The Bills have a defensive front capable of getting after Eli Manning. Pick the team that actually plays in New York. Bills 31, Giants 27.\nPANTHERS (3-0)\nAT BUCCANEERS (1-2)\nNoon Sunday\nPanthers by 3 (O/U 39 1/2 )\nPanthers tight end Greg Olsen is a huge target and should give the Bucs a lot to handle. Cam Newton is not an elite quarterback, but he should be able to outplay Jameis Winston. Panthers 20, Buccaneers 17.\nEAGLES (1-2)\nAT REDSKINS (1-2)\nNoon Sunday\nEagles by 3 (O/U 44)\nThe Eagles are trying to regain their balance after stumbling out of the gate. The Redskins aren't very good, but they should be able to grind out yards on the ground and control the clock. Redskins 24, Eagles 21.\nTEXANS (1-2)\nAT FALCONS (3-0)\nNoon Sunday\nFalcons by 6 1/2 (O/U 46 1/2 )\nThe Falcons have come back to win in the fourth quarter of every game. They shouldn't have to scramble back in this one, considering the Texans don't have that much firepower. Falcons 35, Texans 20.\nCHIEFS (1-2)\nAT BENGALS (3-0)\nNoon Sunday\nBengals by 4 (O/U 45)\nThe Bengals have done a respectable job of handling the run, and that will be key against Jamaal Charles. Bengals QB Andy Dalton has been on fire, and A.J. Green will present problems for the Chiefs defense. Bengals 27, Chiefs 23\nBROWNS (1-2)\nAT CHARGERS (1-2)\n3:05 p.m. Sunday\nChargers by 7 1/2 (O/U 44 1/2 )\nThe Chargers will rebound at home after a couple of rough weeks on the road. They will do a better job of protecting Philip Rivers. The Browns are too erratic and need to figure out their quarterback situation. Chargers 31, Browns 21.\nPACKERS (3-0)\nAT 49ERS (1-2)\n3:25 p.m. Sunday, FOX-32\nPackers by 8 (O/U 48 1/2 )\nSometimes these lopsided matchups don't wind up being huge blowouts. Still, Aaron Rodgers is in midseason form with his accuracy, and Colin Kaepernick is making terrible decisions. Packers 35, 49ers 20.\nRAMS (1-2)\nAT CARDINALS (3-0)\n3:25 p.m. Sunday\nCardinals by 7 (O/U 42 1/2)\nThe Rams' front four matches up well with anyone, so they will likely get to Carson Palmer a few times. But the Rams don't have the explosive players to do big damage, and the Cardinals should contain the run. Cardinals 28, Rams 17.\nVIKINGS (2-1)\nAT BRONCOS (3-0)\n3:25 p.m. Sunday\nBroncos by 6 1/2 (O/U 43)\nPeyton Manning isn't picking apart teams the way he does when he's rolling, but the Broncos defense is so solid it's tough to see them losing this at home. Adrian Peterson has been effective, though. Broncos 27. Vikings 23.\nCOWBOYS (2-1)\nAT SAINTS (0-3)\n7:30 p.m. Sunday, NBC-5\nSaints by 4 1/2 (O/U 46 1/2 )\nDeMarco Murray has to miss that Cowboys line, which is now pushing open big holes for Joseph Randle. Brandon Weeden isn't bad when he has time. The Saints are in a downward spiral. Cowboys 35, Saints 20.\nLIONS (0-3)\nAT SEAHAWKS (1-2)\n7:30 p.m., ESPN\nSeahawks by 10 (O/U 43)\nThe temptation here is to go with the Seahawks, but they are lacking something on offense — they led the lowly Bears just 6-0 at halftime — and now Marshawn Lynch is hurting. The desperate Lions have weapons. Lions 21, Seahawks 20.\nSAM FARMER'S RECORD\nLast week: 14-2 (11-5 vs. spread)\nSeason: 30-18 (30-18 vs. spread)\nPrivacy Policy Cincinnati Bengals Indianapolis Colts Seattle Seahawks Carolina Panthers Atlanta Falcons Arizona Cardinals New York Jets", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560e0579/turbine/sc-farmers-picks-spt-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:56:23.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
