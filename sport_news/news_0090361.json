And its team certainly delivered one as Ferndale cruised to a 55-14 victory over NWC rival Anacortes. \nThe Golden Eagles looked like a team ready for the postseason. They came into the game swinging, scoring early and often. Ferndale scored just minutes into the first quarter off a 25-yard run by junior running back Justin Powell. A little over a minute later Ferndale followed that score with another, this one set up by recovering an Anacortes fumble deep in their territory. Ferndale advanced to 4-1 on the season. \nThis game was won on the ground. Ferndale had four rushers score touchdowns, and its rushing provided a consistent source of offense. \n“The run game starts up front,” Ferndale coach Jamie Plenkovich said. “Our offensive line found all their assignments.” \nSophomore Cole Semu led the Golden Eagles in rushing. His legs brought the team 142 yards and two scores. But this was clearly a team effort, through and through. \n“We have a lot of good strong runners,” Plenkovich said, “and it’s fun watching a bunch of different guys contribute.” \nWhile Ferndale didn’t need to throw the ball often, when they did they found great success with the arm of sophomore quarterback James Hinson. \nHinson was deadly accurate, completing six of his seven passes each one to a different receiver. \n“Hinson has been playing great all year,” Plenkovich said. “He stays calm and knows where to throw the ball.” \nThe Golden Eagles defense was also a bright point, holding their opponent scoreless during the first half. \n“It’s great to throw a shutout in the first half,” Plenkovich said. “It’s really nice watching our kids play fast and hit hard.” \nFerndale’s next games comes against Squalicum on Saturday, Oct. 10, at Civic Stadium.
