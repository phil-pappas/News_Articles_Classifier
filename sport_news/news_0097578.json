What they are going through reminds me of what we went through... 10 years ago.\" \nThe gesture rounded out a day of generosity from the Tigers. The flooding had already moved the game to Baton Rouge and LSU seemed to do whatever it could to make sure the Gamecocks felt like they were playing on their home turf. \nWell the excitement about the upcoming jersey auction was short-lived as different news outlets reported Fournette said the NCAA wouldn't allow him to do it because it would be a \"violation.\" \nExcept, the NCAA quickly tweeted out that Fournette could indeed auction his jersey to help out South Carolina. \nBut it could be easy to see why so many news outlets and Tweeters were confused. You can blame the O'Bannon case. \nFormer UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon led a class-action lawsuit against the NCAA, challenging the organization's ability to profit off of his likeness. The case highlighted the amount of control the NCAA and member institutions have over a student-athlete's likeness.
