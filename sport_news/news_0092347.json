The 1-0 win over No. 22 Hofstra this past Saturday was important to Lundy because the Cougars had qualified for their first Colonial Athletic Association tournament in three years. “The only thing I was thinking about was getting the win so my boys could make the conference tournament,” said Lundy, in his 29th year as the Cougars’ coach. “It was senior night and it secured our spot in the conference tournament, so for me that was more significant than winning my 300th game here. This is a tough conference and only the top six teams make the tournament. So I’m just so happy that we’ll still be playing in November.” After the traditional Gatorade bath from his players and the handshakes and congratulatory slaps on the back, Lundy’s phone didn’t stop ringing all weekend. Lundy was flooded with calls, emails and texts from former players and teammates. “I think that’s been the best part of this,” said Lundy, who played at Western Carolina in the mid-1970s. “Hearing from so many of my former players and even some of the guys I played with in college. It’s so rewarding to hear from all the players. It’s really what this is all about. To know that somehow I’ve had an impact on their lives means a lot to me.” Lundy admits he had only tepid interest in the College of Charleston job when it came open in 1987. He had been a successful coach at Erskine, compiling a 131-71-13 mark in 10 seasons. Erskine had not lost to the Cougars in 16 straight meetings. But he took the job, and two seasons later the Cougars beat nationally-ranked Notre Dame, 2-1, in front of 3,000 people at Patriots Point. “We were still an NAIA program at that point,” Lundy said. “They were a top-10 team and we hyped that game. Every kid that had heard about a soccer ball came out for that game. I remember (College of Charleston) president (Harry) Lightsey didn’t make the kickoff because there was a traffic jam coming off the bridge. I think that kind of put the program on the map.” Lundy built the Cougars into a regional power, winning five conference titles and going to the NCAA tournament five times. “What Coach Lundy has done at the College of Charleston goes so far beyond the 300 wins,” said former Cougars midfielder Troy Lesesne. “His success on the field is unmatched and what’s so inspirational is his relentless pursuit to keep improving and attain even more success. The impact he has had on so many young men in the program’s history is unparalleled. The wins are the byproduct of the relationships he creates with his players.” In 1994, the Cougars won their second straight Trans-America Athletic Conference title and advanced to the national quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament, losing in the final minutes to UCLA and just missing out on a trip the final four. One of the star players on that team — Chad Carithers — went on to play for the U.S. National team. “Coach had more influence on me than any other coach that I played for,” Carithers said. “When I first came to school I was successful because of my speed. Coach Lundy developed my skill from the first day that I walked on campus until the day I left. “The success of the teams that I played for was because of the compassion we had for each other as players and Lundy not just being our coach but being a leader and someone we could all look up to.” The 2010 season was a special year for the Cougars and Lundy, who not only got to coach his son, Ralph, Jr., but was able to host an NCAA tournament game for the first time, beating East Tennessee State, 3-2, at Patriots Point. “We will share that season all of our lives,” Lundy said. “That was a fun group and a special, special year.” Lundy, 65, said he’ll coach as long as his health will allow and the school wants him. “I’m still having fun,” Lundy said. “I still love coming out here every day and working with my boys. Find something you love to do and you never work a day in your life. I’ve been so blessed.” Enlarge College of Charleston soccer coach Ralph Lundy has won 300 games at the school.
