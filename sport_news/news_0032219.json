Comment   Harry Lipsiea Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:05 AM By Harry Lipsiea Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:05 AM Harry Lipsiea Anyone who believed that the University of North Dakota football team's victory over Wyoming to start the season was a signature win for coach Bubba Schweigert changed their mind last Saturday. The relative newcomer to the Big Sky picked up its biggest conference win by topping No. 16 Portland State in impressive fashion on the road. UND beat the ranked Vikings in their own game: by running the ball and winning in the trenches. Defense was key as Portland State, who averaged more than 250 yards per game on the ground, was limited to just 97 yards on 30 carries. North Dakota's front seven showed what it was all about, again dominating the line of scrimmage from the start in the 19-17 victory. Will Ratelle and Cole Reyes led the way with eight stops a piece. Offensively, UND proved it could establish the run against a tough defense. True freshman John Santiago again logged a 100-yard rushing performance. The real star on the ground for UND, however, was quarterback Keaton Studsrud. I have been critical in the past of the sophomore signal caller's performance through the air. The Wisconsin native again failed to impress me with his arm, but 107 yards on the ground was huge in leading his team to its second straight Big Sky win. Studsrud has been doing his part, it just hasn't been as a throwing quarterback. Give him credit for helping moving the chains with his mobility. It was a great team victory for UND. One that surprised me. I thought it would be a good game, but one that Portland State would win thanks to its strength up front. The reason I feel that this is a signature victory for Bubba and crew is that they needed to prove that they can win a close game against a top-flight opponent. The next hurdle UND has to surpass is consistency. So far, the squad has had several nice wins. North Dakota has also almost fell victim to opponents such as Drake and UC Davis. This week's game against Idaho State will be a perfect opportunity to show consistency. It's been a struggle this season for the Bengals. After starting the season with a win over a D-II opponent, Idaho State has dropped four straight, including an 80-8 drubbing at the hands of UNLV. On paper, it doesn't look like there are many opportunities for wins remaining on Idaho State's schedule. With that said, UND can't worry about that. As noted earlier, UND has had a hard time delivering against underwhelming opponents. If there's one thing that scares about the home game this Saturday for North Dakota, it's that the Bengals have found success through the air. UND has struggled with its pass defense so that will be a huge key this week. Page 2 of 2 - Nonetheless, I see North Dakota winning by a score of around 34-10. While the outcome isn't too much in doubt, it will be important for North Dakota to show that it can consistently perform well.
