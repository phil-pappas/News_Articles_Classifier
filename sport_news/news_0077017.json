Glenn (12-0-2, 8-0-2 Suffolk VI) moved into first place in the league with the victory and Spalding, who made seven saves and has only allowed six goals all season, proved key in fighting off a late Miller Place rally.\nHunter Allen began the scoring for the Knights, capitalizing on a one-on-one from 5 yards out. Jacob Sherman sent a near-perfect cross from 25 yards into the middle of the field, which Ruben St. Paul fielded and immediately found Allen for the goal with 19 minutes remaining in the first half.\n\"I called for it, I saw the run across the box,\" Allen said. \"Beating the man goal-side . . . I got it and I just placed it in.\"\nBoys Soccer Glenn vs. Miller Place Allen scored again, this time off a cross from Luke Karen 25 yards out, to extend the Knights' lead to 2-0 with 23 minutes remaining. Then Allen admitted, \"We started letting up because we thought it was over. The other team came out with more energy.\"\nIt didn't take long after that for Miller Place to get on the scoreboard. Carter Contreras dazzled with a series of nice moves near midfield and found Alex Moschella streaking down the left sideline, who then beat Spalding to cut Glenn's lead to 2-1 with 19:54 remaining.\nMiller Place (6-4-1) pushed the pace in the final 20 minutes, creating multiple scoring chances, but Spalding kept making one key save after another.\n\"Sometimes I take it for granted,\" said Glenn coach Lou Hanner. \"I forget that we have so many young players out there.\"\nThe Panthers had one final opportunity with 30 seconds left, but their header attempt after Doug Minogue's throw-in sailed over the net.\n\"It's amazing,\" Allen said about the win. \"Trying to stay undefeated, that's the goal. This game was huge for us. We have two more games, win out and we get the league title. We know that each game means everything. This is my last year, I'm trying to make the most out of it.\"\nFind scores, schedules and stats Search Or\nSelect a sport in spring Nassau county schools\nBoys Badminton Coed Badminton Girls Badminton Baseball Crew Boys Golf Girls Golf Hand Ball Boys Lacrosse Girls Lacrosse Softball Boys Tennis Boys Track and Field Girls Track and Field Boys Volleyball Suffolk county schools\nBoys Badminton Girls Badminton Baseball Crew Boys Golf Girls Golf Hand Ball Boys Lacrosse Girls Lacrosse Softball Boys Tennis Boys Track and Field Girls Track and Field Boys Volleyball Private schools\nBoys Badminton Coed Badminton Girls Badminton Baseball Crew Boys Golf Girls Golf Hand Ball Boys Lacrosse Girls Lacrosse Softball Boys Tennis Boys Track and Field Girls Track and Field Boys Volleyball ALS fundraiser.
