He sees a war zone — barren and desolate. Though four years of considerable drought have caused water levels at the New Melones Reservoir to drop — exposing much of the land from years before it was filled in 1982 and reviving rapids of the Stanislaus River — little remains of what made the site a sentimental memory for Dubois. “The reservoir washing up and down not only killed all of the life that lived in the canyon, it also took the good topsoil that accumulated for tens of thousands of years and slopped it down to the bottom of the reservoir,” said Dubois, a 66-year-old who grew up in Sacramento. In 1979, to prevent the filling of the New Melones Reservoir after numerous political defeats, Dubois — 30 at the time — chained himself to bedrock outside of the Indian Petroglyphs within the canyon. He said he did so fully willing to submerge as the water levels rose. “For me, it was trying to speak on behalf of all the life in that canyon,” Dubois said. “It was my last ditch effort to try to speak out against the absurd.” Although water levels have dropped enough to trigger nostalgic memories and allow for activities that may have been unavailable in decades since its filling, Dubois said it is difficult to revisit the site. “For me, it’s mostly just a painful memory,” he said. “It’s like seeing the bones of a relative. What do you do with the bones of someone dead?” But the pain does not necessarily stop him. The past couple of years have seen Dubois visit the reservoir three times, spending considerable amount of time camping twice. His most recent camping trip — six days this past summer — occurred a year after the first. Dubois says the site was a little different each year. “The earth is always changing. This year, the stream, the reservoir being so low, it has actually flushed some of the sut plateaus out compared to last year. Last year you could walk across this artificial plateau for a long distance,” Dubois said. “Last year, almost nothing grew except for amazing weeds you can handle that could come back. Now there are some trees coming out of the bank, though it will be flooded again when the reservoir is full.” Today, decades after the canyon has been flooded, its beauty remains breathtaking to many. But Dubois said most have no idea how awe inspiring the canyon was before it was filled. Dubois said a thick riparian forest used to line the river, creating a barrier between humanity and wildlife and cooled the water enough to make a habitable environment for fish. “You didn’t get to see critters all that often, but if you went walking into the forest, you would find the prints of all these different animals,” Dubois said. “Occasionally, you’d see the deer, occasionally at night time, you’d get to see the beaver.” The river also gave people a deep sense of connection. Because of its broad sand beaches and its accessibility to civilization, it rivaled the most popular rivers west of the Mississippi. “For anyone who went down into the river before it was flooded, every square foot of that place touched people in ways well beyond any word in the English language I know,” Dubois said. “When I was on the river, I never saw anybody in any city smile as much as I saw people when they were in the magic of that canyon.” In years prior to the current drought, Dubois has made numerous trips to the canyon even after the reservoir was filled and the river was rendered unreachable. “I’ve gone up to the area, but it’s all been inaccessible,” Dubois said. “I’ve been back just because it is still my heart and soul even if it is all destroyed.” When Dubois chained himself to bedrock in 1979, he did not do it as a member of an environmental activist group but as a personal statement. He unchained himself six days later after he realized the reservoir would not be flooded that year. “They could not do it. It delayed the flooding. They could not do it that year,” Dubois said. “It took three more years. They couldn’t flood it even if they wanted to. The only way they could’ve filled the resevoir was the spring melt.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:16:46.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
