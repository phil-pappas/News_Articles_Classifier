Obviously, it wasn't enough at the end,\" said Ezell, who seems to be running with more confidence. \"I'm a senior who has been practicing in this offense for a long time. Getting some game experience has made me more comfortable out there. I'm just trusting my lineman and trusting my reads.\" \nEzell finished with a career-high 75 yards on only six carries and now has six touchdowns. He came into this season with just 12 rushing attempts and zero touchdowns. \nMeanwhile, Swain totaled 59 rushing yards on 15 carries. The 245-pounder got the call on fourth down three times during the game and converted each time with tough inside runs. However, Swain's day was marred by a costly fumble at the Navy 7-yard line when he did not look a pitch all the way into his hands. \nDEFENSE STRUGGLES: Navy came into the contest playing lockdown defense this season, but easily had its worst outing. Notre Dame was successful both running and throwing the ball in rolling up 459 total yards. \n\"Coach (Brian) Kelly is one of the best offensive play-callers in the country and does a really good job of keeping you off-balance,\" Navy head coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \"They started to hit us on the little shuttle play going outside then had the quarterback keep inside. They are well-coached with good schemes and we had a hard time stopping them.\" \nThe Midshipmen had trouble getting their hands on tailback C.J. Prosise, who proved quite elusive in rushing for 129 yards and three touchdowns. The senior speedster averaged 6.1 yards per carry and impressed Niumatalolo along the way. \n\"(Prosise) kind of reminds me of Chuck Muncie,\" said Niumatalolo, referring to the former California-Berkeley and San Diego Chargers running back. \"Very slithery and the next thing you know he's gone. A very patient back who is physical and has really good vision.\" \nNotre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer struggled out of the gate, but finished strong in completing 22 of 30 passes for 281 yards and a score. The 6-foot-4, 230-pound sophomore picked up several big first downs with designed draws or sneaks. \n\"When I saw Kizer in-person I was like 'he's bigger than our linebackers.' I knew he was big from watching TV, but I didn't realize he was that big,\" Niumatalolo said. \nSafety Lorentez Barbour led Navy with a career-high nine tackles while inside linebacker Daniel Gonzales and outside linebacker D.J. Palmore contributed eight apiece. The Fighting Irish were 7 of 12 on third down conversions and were also successful on their lone fourth down attempt. \n\"We made too many mistakes. You make mistakes against a good football team and they're going to take advantage of it,\" Navy interim defensive coordinator Dale Pehrson said. \nPehrson used a 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Will Fuller as an example. Linebacker Kevin McCoy led the charge as the Mids got good pressure on Kizer, who was forced to scramble to buy more time. While running toward the sidelines, Kizer threw on the run to a wide-open Fuller, who caught the ball at the 5-yard line and scooted into the end zone. \n\"We have the quarterback flushed and somebody leaves a receiver open and it turns into a touchdown,\" Pehrson said. \"There were times when we had people get out of their gaps and it turned into a 10-yard gain.\" \nPehrson conceded that Notre Dame's ability to run or throw with equal ease is a tough combination to stop. \n\"They are a very balanced football team. We tried to put people in the box and they throw it out. Or they just sprint it out,\" said Pehrson, who did credit the defense with fighting hard. \nBACKUP QB RESPONDS: Navy backup quarterback Tago Smith started two games last season and saw action in several others. That experience paid dividends on Saturday when Smith was thrust into action while starter Keenan Reynolds was having a leg injury evaluated. \nSmith directed two touchdown drives, one of which he sparked with a 22-yard run. He finished with 47 rushing yards on nine carries, but threw into tight coverage and had a pass intercepted on Navy's last possession. \n\"I thought Tago came in and did a really good job considering the circumstances,\" Niumatalolo said. \nOffensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Ivin Jasper concurred and said it was nice to see Smith's hard work in practice rewarded with a chance to play at storied Notre Dame Stadium. \n\"The kid is a good football player. It's tough for him to be such a good football player and be backing up Keenan,\" Jasper said. \"He could be a slotback and playing a lot for us. He understands that playing quarterback is what's best for our team. It was good to see him go out there and execute and have some fun.\" \nMID BITS: Navy converted just 2 of 11 third down opportunities… That is the fewest third down conversions for the Mids since they went 2-for-11 against Western Kentucky last season… Slotback Dishan Romine tried to make amends for fumbling on the opening kickoff return of the second half by returning the next kickoff 58 yards, a career-long… Cornerback Brendon Clements came up with second interception in as many games and he now has five career picks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:30:38.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
