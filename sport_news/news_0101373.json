Show Caption Previous Next \nOAK RIDGE — Junior sensation Tee Higgins came up with big plays on offense, defense and in the return game as Oak Ridge High School blanked McMinn County 24-0 Thursday night in a non-region game on Blankenship Field. \nWith Texas A&M defensive coordinator John Chavis looking on from the Oak Ridge sidelines, Higgins made an acrobatic touchdown reception, came up with a highlight-film interception and returned a punt 41 yards to set up a touchdown as the Wildcats improved to 7-1. \n\"Wherever you put him, he's going to make a play,\" Oak Ridge coach Joe Gaddis said. \"He was really covered well on the touchdown pass and he just took it away from the guy, and that was a great interception.\" \nHiggins, a Tennessee commitment, totaled six receptions for 95 yards as the Wildcats head into a bye week before returning to action on Oct. 23 against Webb at Oak Ridge. \nThe Cherokees (3-3), behind the running of D.J. Kimpson (38 carries, 159 yards), gave the Wildcats all they wanted in the first half. \nKimpson had 17 carries for 77 yards in the first quarter as McMinn County played keep away. \nT.J. Allison's 2-yard TD run with 2:38 to play in the second quarter — which was set up by Higgins' long punt return — was the lone score of the first half. \n\"All in all, it was a pretty good game against a tough and rugged opponent,\" Gaddis said. \nHiggins put Oak Ridge up 14-0 midway through the third quarter when he hauled in a 16-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jordan Dunbar. \nDunbar added a 7-yard scoring toss to Allison with 4:24 to play, and the Wildcats got a late field goal by Noah Calhoun. \nAllison (21 carries, 96 yards) led Oak Ridge in rushing. \nDunbar had a solid night at quarterback with both his running (nine carries, 63 yards) and passing (9 of 14, 118 yards). \n\"He (Dunbar) pulled some things out of his hat a time or two on some plays that were busted,\" Gaddis said. \nMike Blackerby is a freelance contributor.
