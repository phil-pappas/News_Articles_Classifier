The Mets take the 2-0 lead in the NLCS, and the Bruins beat the Coyotes on Saturday.\nColts’ botched fake punt was an ‘insane’ fail: “The Colts are responsible for what may be the most inexplicable and ill-fated fake punt attempt of the 2015 NFL season. The Patriots were the beneficiaries of this unintentional bit of on-field comedy on Sunday night in Indianapolis.” ( Boston.com )\nThe Colts tried a unique formation on 4th down. It didn't work. #NEvsIND http://t.co/Eh0HXpFV00\n— NFL (@NFL) October 19, 2015 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Chuck Pagano takes blame for fake-punt gaffe, tries to explain what they were thinking: “I take responsibility there,” Pagano said. “The whole idea there was, on a fourth-and-3 or less, shift to an alignment where you either catch them misaligned, they try to sub some people in, catch them with 12 men on the field. If you get a certain look, 3 yards, 2 yards, you can make a play. But again, we shifted over, and I didn’t do a good enough job coaching it during the week.” ( ESPNBoston.com )\nJulian Edelman on failed fake punt: ‘Shame on them’: “I’m glad they did it,” he said. “We got the ball back with great field position. We were alert. Our guys went to where we had to go. And, um, shame on them, trying that again.” ( CSNNE.com )\nSI.com’s Peter King rips Colts’ decision-making in loss to Patriots: “Two things would disturb me if I were a Colts fan, my team chasing the Patriots in what has become a seven-game losing streak against New England and a five-game Pagano Era Frustration Bender (Indy is 0-5 versus New England since Pagano took the coaching job, losing by an average of 24.6 points).” ( Monday Morning Quarterback )\nNew York Mets take a 2-0 series lead over the Chicago Cubs in NLCS:\n#HappyRecap : @Noahsyndergaard shuts down Cubs, Murphy homers as #Mets grab 2-0 lead in #NLCS . http://t.co/dOj7HuPgGV pic.twitter.com/zwkNzga3gg\n— New York Mets (@Mets) October 19, 2015 Chandler Jones: ‘On to the Jets’: “After nine months of incessant Deflategate babble, it had to have felt good for the New England Patriots to knock off the team that initiated it all. Don’t expect any of them to admit it, though.” ( NESN.com )\nWhat we learned from the Bruins’ win over the Coyotes on Saturday: “Kevan Miller is one bad hombre and he’s totally healed up from his shoulder issues.” ( CSNNE.com )\nPHOTOS: Colts fans mock Patriots with Deflategate signs and gear\nPrevious -- of -- Next Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard looks at a sign at the entrance to the New England Patriots tunnel before their game against the Colts.
