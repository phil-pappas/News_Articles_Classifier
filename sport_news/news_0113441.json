He has a career coaching record of 204-183-37 with the Minnesota Wild and the Blue Jackets.\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:36:07.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
