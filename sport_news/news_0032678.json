He'll then travel to to Roseburg to meet with victims' families privately before returning to Eugene and flying to Seattle for a Democratic National Committee roundtable.\nGov. Kate Brown will accompany Obama on his visits with grieving families, Brown's office said Thursday.\nOther than that, few details are known about Obama's visit. He has no public appearances scheduled.\nObama's planned visit has stirred up animosity among conservatives in Douglas County. One group of residents is planning protests at three locations in Roseburg. Leaders say they're expecting at least 2,400 people.\n\"My family, my friends, everybody down here is not happy about him coming,\" said Michelle Finn, an Independence resident who grew up in Roseburg and attended Umpqua Community College. \"He already says he's going to politicize this — he's already going to push his agenda. And if he knew Roseburg and Douglas County, he'd know these are the wrong people to be doing that with.\"\nObama renewed his call for stricter gun laws in the wake of last Thursday's shooting, saying such violence had become \"routine.\"\n— Ian K.
