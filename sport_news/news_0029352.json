It beat Guatemala in 2000 and Canada in 2008 and lost to Mexico in 2004. \nElis struck first in the 24th minute. Kevin Alvarez set the play in motion by sending the ball to him inside the top of the box. \nElis bounced it off his chest and lobbed the ball over two defenders, threading it inside the left post. \nThe U.S. played sloppily for long stretches in the first half and created few scoring chances — with two total shots during the first 45 minutes. \nHonduras had five total shots and two shots on goal. \nThe U.S. finally threatened in the 63rd minute on Cameron Carter-Vickers' header off a corner kick. Honduras goalkeeper Luis Lopez, however, made a diving one-handed deflection. \nElis ended any prospects of a U.S. comeback in the 77th minute. Kevin Lopez crossed into the box, and Elis one-touched it, flicking it inside the far post. \nWALES IS LUCKY LOSER: Despite a 2-0 defeat to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Wales reached its first international tournament since the 1958 World Cup, thanks to Cyprus beating Israel 2-1. \nSeconds after the match in Bosnia ended, Wales learned that the result in Jerusalem had booked it a place at next year's European Championship in France \n\"It's probably the best loss of my life,\" Wales and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale said. \n\"Growing up as a young boy everyone dreams of playing in a major tournament. \nTo achieve it is a dream but it doesn't stop there. We have got to go over there and do some business in France.\" \nAlso qualifying were 1968 champion Italy and World Cup quarterfinalist Belgium. \nThe top two finishers from the nine groups qualify automatically. The best third-place finisher also qualifies automatically, while the eight other third-place teams can reach the tournament through a playoff. \nFIFA INVESTIGATION: As expected, Michel Platini lodged an appeal with FIFA against his 90-day suspension and was backed by the South American confederation, which called for the European soccer leader to be allowed to stand in the presidential election to succeed Sepp Blatter. \nThe intervention comes ahead of a FIFA executive committee meeting later this month which is poised to discuss whether to delay the Feb. 26 emergency presidential election. \nThe Confederation of African Football said Issa Hayatou's kidney illness will not prevent him from carrying out his full duties as acting FIFA president. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:23:09.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
