It is understood that the life patron Otumfuor Osei Tutu II will make knows changes in the club's management. \nThe Asantehene has wielded the axe and, true to expectations in the past week, Opoku Nti has been sacked as club General Manager. The former Kotoko captain had been in charge for the past two seasons. \nSamuel Osei Kuffuor, according to Luv FM’s Delali Atiase, has been mandated by the Asantehene to form his own management team to run the club. \nWhat this means is that the existing board headed by Paul Adu Gyamfi has also been dissolved and therefore, Kuffuor will not work under any board. \nThe former Bayern Munich star was a member of the board of directors of the club that was appointed in 2013 to take over from the Dr Kofi Kodua Sarpong-led board. \nEven before Kuffuor starts work, some are already looking at how the SuperSport football pundit can change the fortunes of the club. \nThis will be his first major assignment as an administrator and he faces an onerous task of improving the club’s finances, improving the dwindling crowds at league matches and signing quality players for next season. \nKotoko failed to defend both their Premier League and FA Cup titles as they went trophyless last season. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
