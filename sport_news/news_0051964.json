As part of Hilton partnership with the region’s Tour, the Asian Tour Hilton Golfer of the Month award aims to recognise the outstanding efforts of the Asian Tour members, both at home and abroad. Lahiri was voted as the winner based on his stellar performance from June to September. Ranked 39th in the world, the Indian star enjoyed a spell-binding opening nine months which saw him win two events sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour. Lahiri also finished joint fifth in the PGA Championship in August, India’s best performance in a Major, and became the first from the country to earn a spot with the Presidents Cup’s International Team. “I’m delighted to earn the fans’ votes for the inaugural Hilton Asian Tour Golfer of the Month award. It is a wonderful recognition and a fantastic initiative for us to engage more with our fans,” said Lahiri, who is currently leading the Asian Tour’s Order of Merit. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:06:55.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
