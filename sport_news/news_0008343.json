Blair wins big over Bunnies at Benson   \nThe Blair volleyball team celebrates a point in the decisive third set of their sweep at Benson on Tuesday night.   \nBlair senior Kortney Smith pokes the ball over the outstretched hands of a Benson Bunny and down for a point in the Bears' sweep on Tuesday night.   \nBlair's Jenna Petersen was all over the court for the Bears in a Tuesday night sweep at Benson High in Omaha. \nBlair will head into a week off with lifted spirits after going on the road Tuesday night to handle Omaha Benson in three straight sets, 25-10, 25-15 and 25-22. \nIt was the second win in three matches for the Bears, who now sit at 4-16. They will take six days off before starting the final stretch of the season with a Tuesday drive to Nebraska City to square off with the Pioneers. \nThe Bears set the tone early, quickly distancing themselves from the Bunnies en route to a dominating 25-10 set victory. They were just as sharp in the second set, winning 25-15. Benson tied the decisive third set up at 22-22, but the Bears scored the final three points to complete the sweep. \nSenior Callie Alberico finished the match with five serves and junior Olivia Frost recorded four. The Bunnies had trouble with the Bears at the net, as senior Jenna Petersen had a team-high nine kills and Frost added six. Alberico, who finished with a team-high 18 assists, had five kills on 10 attacks. \nDefensively, the Bears were stout, amassing 10 blocks and 42 digs. Senior Kortney Smith and Savannah Plonkey each had four blocks while Erika Swenson added three and Petersen and Frost each chipped in with two. \nPetersen registered 10 digs and Jaedyn Morris had eight as the Bears smothered the Bunnies in the first two sets, making it hard for them to get on the scoreboard.
