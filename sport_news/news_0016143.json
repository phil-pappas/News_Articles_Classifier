Howeverr, RB Marshawn Lynch was a full participant for the first time since suffering a hamstring injury against the Chicago Bears and appears on track to return for Sunday’s game against Carolina after missing the last two.\nWagner was one of seven Seahawks to sit out practice. The others were CB Marcus Burley (already declared out for the game Sunday after having thumb surgery last Thursday), CB Tye Smith (hip), DL Frank Clark (hamstring), DE Michael Bennett (non-injury related,meaning he just got a rest day) and LB Nick Moody (ankle).\nListed as limited were DT Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder) and LB Brock Coyle (knee).\nThe injuries to Wagner, Moody and Coyle have the linebacking corps looking a little uncertain. Coach Pete Carroll said Wednesday the team hopes that Wagner will be able to play but that a decision may not come until gametime. The team elevated Moody from the practice squad earlier this week to add depth at linebacker. He was apparently hurt in practice Wednesday since he had not been listed on the report after Wednesday’s practice. Coyle also was not listed Wednesday though Carroll hinted earlier this week that he had something to work through.\nCoyle is listed as Wagner’s backup on the depth chart. However, the team could also move weakside linebacker K.J. Wright to middle linebacker and have Kevin Pierre-Louis play weakside. Pierre-Louis has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury but has returned to practice this week. He was listed as a full participant Thursday and told reporters prior to practice that he will be ready for Sunday’s game.\n \n \nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
