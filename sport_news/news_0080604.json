Wale Aliyu, WKYC 12:15 a.m. EDT October 15, 2015 - 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCLEVELAND -- Rooting on our three major teams is the fun part, maintaining them is the expensive part. \nCuyahoga County Executive Armond Budish introduced legislation this week to cover renovations of the three arenas. \nCuyahoga County is preparing to finance $60 million worth of repairs to the arenas. The roof over Quicken Loans Arena will soon be replaced, and the Cleveland Indians will get a scoreboard upgrade. FirstEnergy Stadium could also see some renovations. \nThe money comes from the county's latest 20-year tax on alcohol and cigarettes, which voters approved in 2014. The controversial legislation passed last year with 56 percent of the vote. \nThe county began collecting the taxes in August. - Like this topic?

For the first time, the county will start to distribute some of the earnings with about one-fourth of the expected revenue going towards the upgrades. \nBudish says because they are bonding money, the tax payers will not be paying any additional funds. \n\"We are obligated to keep those facilities up,\" said Budish. \"The sin tax was what was determined by the voters to use to pay for those facilities. If the sin tax hadn't passed, we are still obligated under the leases to keep up the buildings.\" \nREAD MORE | Josh McCown practices despite ankle soreness \nThe teams want the sin tax money to be split evenly. That will be decided once the legislation goes before a committee. \nCavaliers owner Dan Gilbert has already fronted money for some renovations, including the new scoreboard and sound system that were installed before the start of last season. \nFollow WKYC's Wale Aliyu on Twitter @WaleAliyu and on Facebook at facebook.com/WaleAliyuTV April 6, 2015: Indians pay homage to city's Rock and Roll culture with a table made of oversized guitar picks.
