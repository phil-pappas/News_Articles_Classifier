He passed away in hospital in Southport this morning at the age of 69, surrounded by loved ones. \n\n\"The thoughts of everyone associated with the club are with Howard's family at this difficult time and it would be appreciated if everyone could respect their request for privacy.\" \n\nEverton, who are due to host Manchester United in the Premier League later on Saturday, said that a full tribute would appear on their website shortly. \n\nKendall joined Everton from Preston North End in March 1967 and contributed to their league title success in 1970 after being converted from a defender into a midfielder. \n\nAfter subsequent stints with Birmingham City, Stoke City and Blackburn Rovers, where he worked as player-manager, he returned to Everton, briefly, in 1981, before going into management full-time. \n\nIn his first managerial spell at Everton, he led the team to two league titles, one FA Cup and the 1984-85 European Cup Winners' Cup, which was the club's first, and to date only, continental honour. \n\nLater spells at Everton between 1990 and 1993 and 1997 and 1998 did not prove as successful and he left the club for the final time after they avoided relegation on the final day of the 1997-98 season. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:34:11.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
