We’re still trying to fight the Mets for home-field advantage. It’s kind of a sigh of relief. We weren’t playing that well.” \nDon Mattingly’s Dodgers earned a third straight playoff berth for the first time in franchise history, and did so by snapping a seven-game losing streak at AT&T Park this year. It’s also their sixth postseason berth in 10 years. \nWhen Kelby Tomlinson grounded out to end it and rookie shortstop Corey Seager made a nice throw to first, Kershaw raised both arms in the air as his teammates streamed out of the dugout. They all began hugging and dancing on the mound. \n“He knows what he needs to do against these guys,” catcher A.J. Ellis said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:11:47.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
