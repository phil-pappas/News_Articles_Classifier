No one should deny that\" before adding that al-Husseini had supported the final solution.\n\"There is evidence to this effect in both the Nuremberg trials and of course elaborated in the Eichmann trial,\" he said, standing next to an uncomfortable looking Merkel.\nSince the start of October, Israeli security forces killed 48 Palestinians, among them children by Israeli troops. Nine Israeli have been killed in stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks.\nThe current wave of protests and repression started in late July when 18-month old toddler Ali Dawabsha was burned to death and three other Palestinians severely injured after their house in the occupied West Bank was set on fire by Israeli settlers.\nThe parents of the toddler, Riham and Saad, and their other son Ahmad, later lost their lives after suffering serious injuries in the arson.\nPalestinians have also been protesting repeated illegal Israeli and Jewish settler attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque and the closing of the Muslim holy site to worshippers on numerous occasions. Protests have taken place in occupied East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nOn Wednesday, A 15-year-old Palestinian girl was injured in the occupied West Bank morning after Israeli troops shot her, later claiming she was armed, the Palestinian news agency Ma'an reported.\nA Palestinian Authority official, Ghassan Daghlas, said Israel accused 15-year-old Istabraq Ahmed Noor of planning to sneak into an illegal Israeli settlement to stab residents, according to Ma'an.\nFollowing the incident Israeli occupation forces effectively sealed off two Palestinian villages south of Nablus, where Noor lives, by establishing checkpoints at their entrances, Ma'an reported Wednesday.\nElsewhere in the occupied Palestinian territories, Israeli settlers on Tuesday attacked a 14-year-old Palestinian boy near Jenin.\nSaqir Mahmoud Hirzallah and his friends were attacked while collecting olives in fields owned by the boy's family. His friends managed to escape unharmed.\n*This story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:40:04.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
