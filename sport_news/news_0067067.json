I kind of like to watch them, kind of represent them.” \nColumbia Academy’s most impressive drive of the game opened the first quarter when the Bulldogs ran the ball down Whitwell’s throat on six straight carries to paydirt. \n“That was planned,” Charlie Lansdell said “We wanted to come out and run the football a little bit tonight and show people that we are a balanced team. We can run the ball just as well as we can throw it.” \nA 10-yard power toss to the right by Garrison was followed by an 8-yard carry by Hudson Primm. \nWith the ball at midfield, it was Logan Neal’s turn to gash the Tiger defense with his legs as the running back nicknamed, “Blackjack” gained 31 yards blasting to the left. \n“I tell you what, that’s an awesome sight. I love it man,” Neal said. “When you see that open as a running back, all you do is you shift another gear and try to get as much as you can.” \nNeal’s carry took CA down to the Tiger 19 when Garrison marched the pigskin another 12 yards to the seven. \nA 2-yard run up the gut by Primm got the Bulldogs near the end zone and Neal would do the rest for the 2-yard touchdown run. \nWith 10:06 to play in the first quarter, Columbia Academy was already up 7-0 without attempting a pass. \n“It shows how lethal Thomas and Hudson are and it just really shows what we can do,” Neal said. “When we are on fire blocking and everybody is getting their blocks and doing their jobs, I don’t really think anybody is going to stop us.” \nThe Bulldogs padded their lead at 14-0, with 5:34 to play in the opening quarter, when Johnson found Thompson for a 15-yard touchdown grab. \nCA showed more of its offensive balance when Primm pounded his way two yards for the team’s third touchdown of the game and a 21-0 score with 1:33 to play in the second quarter. \n“We’re such a dynamic team,” Primm said. “Every time we step on to the field, you never know what we are going to do.” \nJust before halftime, Whitwell punted the ball to Thompson who returned it 64 yards coming just a yard short of scoring a touchdown. \nWith 17 seconds remaining in the second quarter, Thompson forced himself over the goal line on a wildcat play for the 1-yard score that made it 28-0, CA at the half. \nIt was more of the same for the Bulldogs early in the third quarter as Garrison showed his speed on a 60-yard punt return for a touchdown. \nWith the score already at 35-0 in favor of Columbia Academy, Mr. Everything made another electrifying play with the ball in his hands as Johnson connected with Garrison for a 23-yard scoring catch. \nWhitwell’s Jake Sartin would collect three rushing touchdowns against CA’s freshmen and JV defense, but it would be too little too late as the Bulldogs cruised 41-24 in the end.
