To do so, the state has sent Multnomah County millions of tax dollars on services – such as drug treatment, housing placement and help finding a job – to help certain arrested people with their problems.\nCounty commissioners on Thursday agreed to apply for $8.1 million for two fiscal years. For Hinojosa, the Multnomah County Justice Reinvestment program worked like a charm.\n\"I go to meetings every day. I've been donating time to babysit for my friend, who wants to go to college, and watch her kids three days a week,\" she said. \"I have respect for myself. I was willing to fight for what I really wanted in life.\"\nShe's among 531 arrested people who were assessed from July 2014 through June, after their arraignment as they awaited trial. The evaluations look at their criminal histories, the impact of their crime on the victim, their risk of offending again and the nature of the offense. And there's almost 600 others waiting in line for the same opportunity.\nCrimes that qualify include second-degree assault, second-degree robbery and repeat property and drug offenses. Crimes that don't qualify include homicide, sex crimes, domestic violence felonies or other felony cases where the victim is younger than 14 years old.\nOf those 531, 284 were chosen for the program while 134 were sent to prison and another 113 were chosen for other diversionary programs such as a drug treatment court, District Attorney Rod Underhill said last week .\nOf the 284 people in the program, 13 have either committed a crime or not followed the rules of their probation, said Christine Myers, a county parole and probation officer who has supervised people in the program.\nFunding for the program has helped employers give probationers a chance to get some experience, she said. For example, a fast food chain has hired probationers to work a couple of months to help them gain employment experience for their resume, Myers said.\nWith $8.1 million expected from the state, Multnomah County will continue funding the same service levels from the program's first year and officials will be able to add a supervisor for the 12 probation officers in the program, said Ginger Martin, deputy director of the county Department of Community Justice. The money will also pay for a nonprofit to work with people in jail to prepare them for the probation period once they are free.\n\"The concept of it as a program that reduces our reliance on prison is wonderful,\" said Kathleen Dunn, director of the Metropolitan Public Defender Services. But with tight funding from the state to pay public defenders, attorneys are working up to 25 percent more than before the program started, she said.\nThat's because coordinating schedules with other officials in the justice system requires more time for the program, she said.\n\"They're not about to give up in the face of the challenge,\" Dunn said. \"If it's good for the client, then they're going to do it. If it means they'll stay late, then they'll do it.\"\n-- Tony Hernandez\nthernandez@oregonian.com\n503-294-5928\n@tonyhreports", "external_links": ["https://multco.us/lpscc/mcjrp", "http://www.twitter.com/tonyhreports", "http://mcda.us/index.php/about-the-da/meet-the-da/"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:12:48.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
