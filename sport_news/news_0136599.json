Tyrell Cameron from Louisiana , Ben Hamm from Oklahoma, and Evan Murray from New Jersey passed away after sustaining injuries. Sadly, there is now a fourth name to add to that list.\nOn Friday night, Kenny Bui , a senior at Evergreen High School in Evergreen, Wash., was injured while making a tackle during a game. He was rushed to the hospital and underwent emergency surgery because of a brain injury. As of yesterday, he was listed in critical condition, but Bui died earlier today.\nEven though it feels like this is happening more and more often, it never gets any easier to write these stories. So sad.\n .\n[ via USA Today High School Sports ]", "external_links": ["http://usatodayhss.com/2015/seattle-football-injuries-tackling-head-neck"], "published": "2015-10-06T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:29:06.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
