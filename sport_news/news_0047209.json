Young knows it might sound silly, but she considers the Hawthorne Bridge – with its twin lift towers seemingly flexing 1,383 feet of steely muscles – to be the tough-love friend pushing her not to give up.\n\"It's my rock,\" Young said. \"I see the bridge all lit up and I know that I'm halfway to work. It know it will always be there to help carry me, to tell me, 'You can do it.'\"\nAs Portland has blossomed as a bicycle Valhalla, the Hawthorne has taken the job of carrying waves of bike commuters over the Willamette River. According to the bridge's digital bike counter, some 8,000 cyclists a day use it, largely because it links to Southeast Portland's labyrinth of popular bikeways.\nJennifer Young, a surgical technician at Doernbecher Children's Hospital, rides her bike across the Hawthorne Bridge daily. The photos in this gallery show the Hawthorne from its construction to now. (Mike Zacchino/Staff) The Oregonian No doubt, every digit on the bike counter represents a story. Young's bicycling testimonial of overcoming anorexia, with a destructive diet of coffee, cigarettes and beer, can't be separated from the bridge.\n\"I know every crack, every bump, every little ridge on her,\" said the 40-year-old surgical technician at Doernbecher Children's Hospital. \"It feels solid and real. I like that. I just wish the sidewalks were wider.\"\nDuring rush hour, even experienced riders have occasionally fallen off the elevated, 10-foot-wide sidewalks into the traffic lanes used by 30,000 motorists a day. But to be fair, the city's oldest existing highway span across the Willamette has withstood decades of constant refinement, adaptation and grousing as the city's fickle transportation tastes changed.\nWhen it opened in December 1910, the Hawthorne's deck was made of creosoted wood deemed optimal for streetcars, pedestrians and horses. The bridge was strikingly large and ambitious for its time, especially the complex 251-foot-long vertical-lift span, which relied on electric engines and 880,000-pound suspended counterweights to function.\nStill, Portland residents complained fiercely about the bridge taking a whole 18 months to build.\n'Spanning Oregon' For the next few months, we'll take you on a weekly tour of our most iconic bridges around Portland and beyond – landmarks built of steel, concrete, wood and brick that have shaped our landscape and contributed to our growth and prosperity. The series is part of \"Spanning Oregon,\" a new coffee-table book produced by staff writers and photographers of The Oregonian/OregonLive. To order advance copies, go to oregonlive.com/bridgesbook . By 1944, the daily damage by trucks and cars prompted Multnomah County to replace the wood deck with metal grates, despite a wartime restriction on using steel.\nFifty years later, a renovation project changed the Hawthorne's color from a drab ochre to dark green with red trim. In an effort to make the span more inviting to bicyclists, engineers also figured out how to add 4 feet to the 6-foot-wide sidewalks on each side.\nYoung's first encounter with the Hawthorne was in 2007, shortly after she had bought a bicycle so that her son wouldn't have to ride alone.\nYoung was 5-foot-7, suffering from an eating disorder and living in constant fear of hitting 100 pounds. She didn't have the energy to keep up with her young boy. Ashamed, she swore that she would get healthier by bike commuting daily across the bridge and up Marquam Hill.\nAt first, she rode the Portland Aerial Tram on the final leg. Now, she proudly bikes up the hill. She has reached her ideal weight, gaining 40 pounds, much of it muscle.\n \"I've always had this deal with myself and the bridge,\" Young said. \"There's a bus stop on the Hawthorne. If I'm ever too drained when I reach it, I would stop and take the bus the rest of the way. You know what? I've never taken the bus.\"\n — Joseph Rose\n503-221-8029\njrose@oregonian.com\n@josephjrose", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/josephjrose", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fspanning_oregon_portlands_hawt_16.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18935034-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EThe%20Hawthorne%20Bridge%20at%20night%20in%20Portland%20August%201%2C%202015.%20%20%28Beth%20Nakamura%2FStaff%29%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Joseph%20Rose%20%7C%20The%20Oregonian%2FOregon", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fspanning_oregon_portlands_hawt_15.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18935033-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EThe%20Hawthorne%20Bridge%20at%20night%20in%20Portland%20August%201%2C%202015.%20%20%28Beth%20Nakamura%2FStaff%29%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Joseph%20Rose%20%7C%20The%20Oregonian%2FOregon", "http://www.pediment.com/products/spanning-oregon-bridges-pictorial-history-hardcover-book?utm_campaign=orbridgebook&utm_source=oregonian&utm_medium=o_online_article", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fhawthorne_bridge_2.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18935607-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EThe%20Hawthorne%20Bridge%20at%20night%20in%20Portland%20August%201%2C%202015.%20%20Beth%20Nakamura%2FStaff%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Beth%20Nakamura%20%7C%20The%20Oregonian%2FOregonLive", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fspanning_oregon_portlands_hawt_17.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18935035-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EHawthorne%20Bridge%2C%20July%2031%2C%202015.%20%28Beth%20Nakamura%2FStaff%29%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Joseph%20Rose%20%7C%20The%20Oregonian%2FOregonLive", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fspanning_oregon_portlands_hawt_14.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18935032-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EThe%20Hawthorne%20Bridge%20at%20night%20in%20Portland%20August%201%2C%202015.%20%20%28Beth%20Nakamura%2FStaff%29%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Joseph%20Rose%20%7C%20The%20Oregonian%2FOregon", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fhawthorne_bridge_1.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18935606-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EThe%20tone%20of%20a%20car%20driving%20across%20the%20open%20steel%20grates%20of%20the%20Hawthorne%20Bridge%20at%2030%20mph%20is%20a%20C%20note.%20Bicycle%20riders%20and%20pedestrians%20use%20recently%20wi"], "published": "2015-10-10T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:32:42.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
