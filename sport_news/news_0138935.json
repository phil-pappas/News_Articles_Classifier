Far from it.\nAfter struggling to put away UConn 30-13 on Friday, the 3-2 Cougars face two more American Athletic Conference teams this month that figure to be substantially stronger than the pesky, much-improved Huskies.\nNext up is 3-2 East Carolina, which blasted SMU 49-23 on Saturday after trailing 23-7 in the first half. Saturday's game (5:30 p.m., ESPNU) will mark the first-ever meeting between BYU and ECU.\n  The Pirates, who will host BYU in Greenville, N.C., in 2017, defeated Virginia Tech 35-28 on Sept. 26, their fifth-straight win over an Atlantic Coast Conference team. They nearly knocked off the SEC's Florida before falling 31-24 in Gainesville on Sept. 12.\nThe Pirates are good, and a lot better than many BYU fans realize, BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall said in June when he warned everyone that the Cougars' schedule was not just difficult in September.\nWhat's more, East Carolina has the type of dual-threat quarterback that has given the Cougars fits in the past. Junior James Summers replaced starter Blake Kemp in the second quarter and led the comeback against SMU, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two more.\nHe completed 9 of 10 passes for 153 yards and rushed for 85 yards on nine carries, masterfully directing the \"Air Raid\" offense that coach Ruffin McNeill brought to ECU from Texas Tech in 2010. Against Virginia Tech, Summers ran 21 times for 169 yards and two TDs.\nMendenhall said he was pleased with BYU's rush defense against UConn, which managed just 62 yards.\n\"Overall, I thought we took another step forward,\" he said. \"I know it is hard to say, but in the Michigan game we actually played the run better than we did against UCLA. Different style of run game, but we are gradually taking steps forward defensively and managing the points, and just step by step we will build into a really strong defense at some point.\"\nMendenhall said he hopes to get run-stuffing nose tackle Travis Tuiloma back from a knee injury this week, and that middle linebacker Harvey Langi has \"a great chance\" to be back after sitting out Friday with assorted injuries.\nDefensive end Bronson Kaufusi, who had a key interception against the Huskies, said the win was huge from a confidence standpoint.\n\"Being able to win this game just sets us up for having a really great October,\" Kaufusi said. \"We are going to come back Monday and just get better. Every week we just have to improve, keep our guys healthy, and just go one day at a time.\"\nAfter hosting the Pirates on Saturday, the Cougars face a quick turnaround the following Friday against a well-rested, 3-2 Cincinnati team which has a bye this week after knocking off Miami 34-23 last Thursday.\n\ndrew@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @drewjay", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:40:07.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
