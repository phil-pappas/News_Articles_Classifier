The ship’s captain, Michael Davidson, was a 53-year-old veteran from Windham, Maine, one of four New Englanders aboard the lost vessel.\nRelated Link Six crew members aboard sunken cargo ship had deep New England ties Those who knew him described Davidson as a kind, capable man with an infectious smile.\n “He takes being a captain seriously, and was always drawn to the water,” said Nick Mavodones, a Portland city councilman and operations manager at Casco Bay Lines, a Maine island ferry service based in Portland.\nMavodones, who grew up with Davidson in South Portland, later worked with him at Casco Bay lines in the 1980s, where Davidson started out as a deckhand. He eventually worked his way up to captain before enrolling at Maine Maritime Academy.\n“He was always very squared away, very detailed,” Mavodones said. “He took being a captain seriously, and was always a prudent mariner who payed attention to detail.”\nGene Willard, a ferry captain for Casco Bay Lines, also worked as a deckhand with Davidson for many years before they both became captains.\n“What I can tell you is that Mike Davidson is the most competent of captains that are out there,” Willard said. “I don’t know what to say. This is a tragedy.”\nThe Boston Globe reported on Monday that Captain Thomas Bushy, vice president for marine operations at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, wouldn’t comment on whether Davidson made the wrong call when he set sail despite Hurricane Joaquin’s presence in the Bahamas.\n“He made a professional call,’’ Bushy said.\nMavodones described Davidson as always being deeply concerned with the safety of his passengers, cargo, and crew.\n“Nothing at all would make me think he isn’t as diligent today as he was when I worked with him,” Mavodones said.\nWillard echoed this sentiment, saying: “He is very meticulous, very competent. My prayers are out there with his family.”\nCertified mariners go through endless safety drills, and trainings for surviving an emergency like this one.\n“These able-bodied seamen are highly trained, and they all go through professional development when they’re not at sea,” Mavodones said. “They’re very, very well-educated and well-trained mariners, and we’re just all hoping and praying that [the Coast Guard] will be able to find people.”", "external_links": ["http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/10/05/mass-maritime-grad-board-ship-missing-cargo-ship/AL3ykGfbbBVD83VRENyyQL/story.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:04:57.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
