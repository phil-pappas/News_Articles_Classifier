Photograph by: Jeff McIntosh , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nCALGARY — In Pittsburgh, Brandon Sutter played behind the team’s two best players. With Vancouver, he gets to play with them, and Sutter is as surprised as anyone by that. \nOpening a National Hockey League season — or any hockey season — as a right-winger for the first time, Sutter scored in his Canuck debut and combined with linemates Daniel and Henrik Sedin for six points in a 5-1 Vancouver win against the Calgary Flames. \nThe impressive victory, so unlike their loss to the physical Flames in last year’s playoffs, opened the Canucks’ 45th NHL season. They are at least 97 games away from winning their first Stanley Cup, but Wednesday was a good first step. \nThe Canucks outplayed and outshot the Flames and won going away. They built an early two-goal lead and were seldom under sustained pressure because they moved the puck quickly and safely from their own zone, defusing the Calgary forecheck. And the best forwards in the game, as they’ve been so often the past decade, were Danny and Hank Sedin. \nSutter was pretty good, too. Acquired by the Canucks from the Pittsburgh Penguins to centre the second or third line, Sutter is instead playing right wing for the first time since his NHL career began seven seasons ago. \nThere was a theory that Sutter might flourish offensively with the Canucks, freed from playing behind superstars Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. But no one foresaw him switching to right wing and playing with the leading scorers in Canuck history. \nDaniel Sedin had a goal and two assists against the Flames, Sutter had one and one, and Henrik Sedin finished with an assist. At this rate, Sutter will never get back to centre. \n“We’ll see,” Sutter, 26, smiled. “Who knows what’s going to happen down the road. The coaches are trying to find chemistry and find things that work, and I thought all four lines went well tonight, so I’m sure we’ll see the same thing next game. Good to get that good start and some chemistry going and score a few goals.” \nAsked about the transition to wing, initiated by coach Willie Desjardins for the Canucks’ final pre-season game, Sutter said: “It’s actually not too bad. I’m still taking faceoffs on the right side of the ice, so that’s natural. Even when the puck’s dropped, the first guy back plays centre for that shift anyway. To be honest with you, it’s been a little easier than I expected just in terms of positioning. I’ve still got some things to work on, some things along the wall that I’m not used to, but I guess I’ll get better at it.” \nSutter said the Sedins are such smart and responsible players, they’re easy to play with. \nHe batted in Daniel’s deflected centring pass to make it 2-0 for the Canucks at 18:01 of the first period, Danny scored with a lucky bounce off his shin pad in the final minute of the second, and Henrik finished scoring with a third-period bank shot off Flames’ goalie Karri Ramo. \nShots were 44-30 for the Canucks, and that was after a flurry by the Flames in garbage time. \n“Tonight we got some lucky goals, but we worked hard to get those goals, too,” Daniel said. “I think the way we played tonight, we took Ferland and those guys out of the game. We did a good job coming back (as forwards) and helping our D out, and made it easier for them. Watching Bartkowski, he’s such a great skater, it’s beautiful to watch. Hutton, too, made some good plays.” \nIn that one sentence, Danny hit on several key elements. \nFlames’ battering ram Micheal Ferland, who exemplified Calgary’s physical dominance over Vancouver in the playoffs, was challenged to fight by Canuck Derek Dorsett on the opening faceoff and was a non-factor in the game. \nHelped by new puck-moving defencemen Matt Bartkowski and Ben Hutton, the latter making his NHL debut at age 22, the Canucks were noticeably quicker and cleaner at exiting their zone. \nJannik Hansen, on a pass from Hutton, and Alex Burrows also scored for the Canucks. Jiri Hudler was the only Flame to beat Canuck goalie Ryan Miller. \nDorsett’s fight with Ferland may have been staged, but it was not pointless. \n“I thought about it for a while,” Dorsett said. “And when I (saw) what the starting lineups were, I knew I was going to ask him to fight. He’s an honest player, he plays hard. He obviously made a statement last year in the playoffs. I just wanted to make it clear that we were going to give him some pushback.” \nMonths from now, maybe we’ll see Dorsett’s initiative as a statement about the Canucks. Flames coach Bob Hartley wasn’t reading much into it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:31:56.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
