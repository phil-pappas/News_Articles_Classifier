I don't think any one play necessarily changed the game for us.\" \nManuel rallied the Bills (3-4) with touchdown passes to Robert Woods and Marcus Easley, whose 58-yard touchdown with 6:33 remaining followed by LeSean McCoy's 2-point conversion got the Bills within 27-24 of the Jaguars (2-5). \nIt was Easley's first catch of the season and third of his five-year career. \nBlake Bortles then overthrew a pass to Allen Robinson that landed in the arms of safety Corey Graham, who returned it untouched through traffic down the right sideline for a 44-yard score to put the Bills up 31-27 with 5:21 remaining. \nThe Bills' defense appeared to stop the Jaguars' next possession. \nBut on third-and-15 from the Jaguars 47, cornerback Nickell Robey was called for interference, giving the Jaguars a first down — and Bortles delivered the key score two plays later. \nRolling right to evade the rush on second-and-5 from the Bills 31, Bortles looked to have enough running room to get the first down. Instead, he threw the ball deep to Allen Hurns, who caught the game-winner with a leaping grab near the left pylon. \n\"Obviously it is an extremely painful loss,\" Bills coach Rex Ryan said. \"To have the courage to battle back the way we did, battle all the way back, then to give it up at the end (was) a devastating loss to say the least. ... It just kills you right now.\" \nManuel started to put the Bills in a hole by failing to detect a cornerback blitz from Aaron Colvin, who jarred the ball loose as Manuel was about to throw. Chris Clemons scooped up the fumble for a 6-yard touchdown that puts the Jags up 14-3. \nOn his next play, Manuel failed to see linebacker Telvin Smith sliding back into zone coverage and tossed a pass intended for Woods. Smith ran 26 yards for the score. \nOn the next series, Posluszny stepped in front of a pass intended for Chris Hogan, setting up a short Jaguars drive capped by T.J. Yeldon's 28-yard touchdown run that put the Jags up 27-3 when kicker Jason Myers missed the extra point. \nManuel wasn't the only culprit on offense. McCoy, who gained 68 yards on 18 carries, took a dump-off pass from Manuel from the Bills 26 to the 1-yard line — but as McCoy spun away from one tackler, safety Johnathan Cyprien put his helmet into the ball and jarred it loose for a turnover that kept the Jaguars ahead 27-16. \nRyan said he never considered benching Manuel for third-string quarterback Josh Johnson. \n\"I thought he needed a chance to rebound. I thought he did,\" Ryan said. \nRyan said the Bills play-calling on offense was handicapped by technical difficulties with the coaches' electronic communications with Manuel, who frequently had to run to the sideline to get the play call. \nRyan said most of the game their connection with Manuel was \"static — you couldn't hear anything.\" He said the experience \"was absolutely miserable ... unacceptable.\" \nThe Bills enter their bye week hoping for rapid recoveries for Taylor, starting wide receivers Sammy Watkins and Percy Harvin, and right tackle Seantrel Henderson. Ryan said his team was committed to winning out the rest of the way and climbing back into contention in the AFC East . \n\"When we get this team back to full strength, with having Sammy Watkins, Percy Harvin, Tyrod Taylor and our right side of the line, that would be a heck of a start,\" Ryan said. \nNOTES: The 58-yard TD pass from EJ Manuel to Marcus Easley was Buffalo's longest play of the season ... This was the second of three regular-season NFL games at Wembley this season. The New York Jets beat the Miami Dolphins 27-14 on Oct. 4, and the Detroit Lions will face the Kansas City Chiefs next Sunday ... The attendance was 84,021, the second highest at Wembley after 2009 when the New England Patriots beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:32:47.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
