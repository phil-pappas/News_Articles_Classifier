This is the one I should have known better on. Not a good matchup for Stockton and on the road. That’s a bad combination. Whiff of the week: Ozark over Branson. 41-7? Where did this come from Pirates? Maybe you should have homecoming every week. Best pick: Fair Grove over Strafford. The Indians are still dangerous and made this a close one, but Fair Grove got the defensive stand to make me look good. VIDEO: Top Plays of Week 6 Football Week 7 Picks Jordan’s Bold prediction: Ava over Thayer. The Bears had some down weeks, but I think they are putting it together. On paper, being two classes bigger, they should beat Thayer. But, I’m fully prepared for the fine folks of Oregon County to tell me how much of an idiot I am should the Bobcats win. Joboo’s Bold prediction: None. I think we’re looking at a fairly straight-forward week of games. Consider this the calm before the storm of the next 2 weeks. Jordan’s Toughest call: Kickapoo over West Plains. All year we have talked about how good this Kickapoo team is, which is completely justified; outside of Webb City there is no one better. But, West Plains has done nothing to remove itself from the conversation of the area’s best and have largely been an afterthought in Class 4 with Webb and Carl Junction. There is just something about this team that has been special over the last two years. They are sound defensively and play with an edge. They’ve also had some Zizzer magic, winning seven of nine games decided by one possession in the last two years. I think they have the chops to hang with Kickapoo, especially giving the Chiefs some problems because of what they do offensively, but ultimately there have just been too many injuries for me to feel confident picking the Zizzers. You have to load the box to stop Kickapoo and Chris Lawson has been too efficient in the passing game to make that a viable option. This is by far the best and biggest game of the week. Joboo’s Toughest call: Willard over Republic . – Both teams have been up & down with both coming off down weeks. And you have the marquee matchup at running back. I’ll give the nod to Willard on their home field. Full Week 7 Picks In the Zone: Week 7 Preview Rest of Week 7 Picks Aurora vs. Nevada Jordan’s Pick: Aurora – They have come a long way since that Week 1 loss to Cassville and are definitely ready to right the ship after last week’s controversial loss to Monett. Joboo’s Pick: Aurora – The Houn Dawgs district fate is out of their hands, but they have to stay focused. Nevada nearly beat 6-0 Sedalia Smith-Cotton 2 weeks ago. Branson vs. Carthage Jordan’s Pick: Carthage – Branson is playing better football, but this Carthage team has been playing extremely well, even without Alex Derryberry. Joboo’s Pick: Carthage – The Tigers proved their ability to ground & pound last week rushing for more than 400 yards and 5 TDs. They very well could repeat those numbers against the Pirates. Buffalo vs. Springfield Catholic Jordan’s Pick: Springfield Catholic – I don’t think this Irish team is as bad as their record indicates. They should get a W this week. Joboo’s Pick: Springfield Catholic – It’s been a rough year for the Irish but win No. 2 should come this week. Butler vs. Stockton Jordan’s Pick: Butler – Kaleb Kauffman and Devan Loveall have run wild all year, Stockton keeps it close, but comes up just short. Joboo’s Pick: Butler – Butler’s only loss was a good showing against Lamar. Since beating Strafford, the Tigers have been outscored 19-68. Camdenton vs. Waynesville Jordan’s Pick: Camdenton – Lots of Jay Griffin for Camdenton, who should pick up win No. 3 in a row. Joboo’s Pick: Camdenton – The Lakers have found their offensive rhythm and are making their typical late-season surge. Carl Junction vs. Monett Jordan’s Pick: Carl Junction – This is quietly one of the best games in the state on paper. But, Carl Junction is just too loaded. Bulldogs win. Joboo’s Pick: Carl Junction – After a war at Aurora, the Cubs get what may be the best Carl Junction team ever. This probably doesn’t end well for them. DISTRICT FOOTBALL STANDINGS - CLICK HERE Cassville vs. Mount Vernon Jordan’s Pick: Mount Vernon – They are playing with some confidence now and Garrett Hadlock has plenty of weapons. Look for Tom Cox to unleash them in a slight upset. Joboo’s Pick: Cassville – Don’t count the Mountaineers out, but after playing the top 3 in the Big 8 the last three weeks, Cassville should be ready to make a run to the playoffs. El Dorado Springs vs. Pierce City Jordan’s Pick: El Dorado Springs – The schedule has done them zero favors, look for that El Do rushing attack to get back on track this week. Joboo’s Pick: El Dorado Springs – I honestly have no idea what to make of the Bulldogs right now. But I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt here. Glendale vs. Rolla Jordan’s Pick: Jordan’s Pick: Glendale – If these two don’t combine to score 150 points I’ll be disappointed. I feel like there will be at least one record broken. Joboo’s Pick: Glendale – I see this being similar to last year. A 100% shootout. And I think like last year, the Falcons will fire the last shot. Hillcrest vs. Parkview Jordan’s Pick: Parkview – I think Parkview wins easily, but don’t be surprised if Hillcrest sophomore Josh Powell has a big night, as the Vikings defense has been susceptible against the pass. It will be another 250-yard game for Anthony Riley. Joboo’s Pick: Parkview – Hillcrest’s first win is coming, but not this week. A steady diet of Viking rushers will be too much. Houston vs. Willow Springs Jordan’s Pick: Houston – Houston is just too big and physical upfront. Tigers right the ship this week. Joboo’s Pick: Houston – The Tigers have cooled from their 3-1 start, but after showing well against Ava and Salem, I think they’ll take care of the Bears. Joplin vs. Lebanon Jordan’s Pick: Joplin – I think the Eagles have figured out some of those defensive problems, or at least enough to allow the offense to outscore people. Colby Cornett has had back-to-back 300-yard games and can also beat you with his legs. Joboo’s Pick: Lebanon – This has the makings of a tough, close game. But I like Lebanon to bounce back from last week and stay in the OC race. PLAY HS FOOTBALL U'PICKEM AND WIN FREE ANDY'S - CLICK HERE Lamar vs. East Newton Jordan’s Pick: Lamar – East Newton has scored 13 points all season. Lamar gave up less than that to state-ranked Monett. Joboo’s Pick: Lamar – The Tigers get back to Lamar early with another W. Rogersville vs. Bolivar Jordan’s Pick: Bolivar – Rogersville throwing darts, Bolivar is throwing torpedoes. Joboo’s Pick: Bolivar – The Wildcats get back to Rogersville early. Marionville vs. Fair Grove Jordan’s Pick: Marionville – Fair Grove has played much better and it won’t be the 54-13 spread it was last year, but the Comets win again. The Eagles are one year away. Joboo’s Pick: Marionville – The Eagles could guarantee themselves a winning season with a victory. But the Comet train is rollin’ and I don’t think they’ll get derailed. Miller vs. Diamond Jordan’s Pick: Diamond – The Wildcats are 4-2 with those losses coming to unbeaten Lockwood and Jasper. They won’t lose another game before districts. Joboo’s Pick: Diamond – After getting their first win of the year, Miller is in for a tougher time with Diamond’s defense. Mountain Grove vs. Salem Jordan’s Pick: Mountain Grove – Salem is big and could give Grove some problems, but the Panthers are looking to make a statement after that Liberty loss. Joboo’s Pick: Mountain Grove – Nothing is for certain when you travel to Salem. But look for the Panthers to take out some frustration on the Tigers and get the win. MV-BT/Liberty vs. Cabool Jordan’s Pick: MV-BT/Liberty – Josh Pruett has three straight games with at least four touchdowns. That won’t change here. Joboo’s Pick: Mt. View-Liberty – Just to look ahead, if Lamar & Liberty both end up the No. 1 seed in their districts and win, the quarterfinal game would be in Howell County, again. STATEWIDE MEDIA FOOTBALL RANKINGS - CLICK HERE Lighthouse Christian vs. Tulsa NOAH Jordan’s Pick: Lighthouse Christian – You’ve got a friend. No, just Lighthouse Christian does and he’s really good. Chargers win. Joboo’s Pick: Lighthouse Christian – NOAH is 0-4, but the teams they’ve played have a combined record of 12-1. Still like the Chargers though. Osceola vs. Adrian Jordan’s Pick: Osceola – This will not be a gimme and on paper you might lean towards Adrian, especially on the road. But, three Carneys are better than none. Joboo’s Pick: Osceola – The Indians seem to be back on track. They’ll need to stay on it to get a win against a good 4-2 Adrian squad. Ozark vs. Nixa Jordan’s Pick: Nixa – They say you can throw the records out in rivalry games, but that’s not always true. Joboo’s Pick: Nixa – The Eagles aren’t exactly reeling from back to back losses, but I think they’ll be happy to get a win here. Pleasant Hope vs. Ash Grove Jordan’s Pick: Ash Grove – The other JB, Jackson Bagley, will have one of those epic games in Ash Grove’s final tune-up before Fair Grove and Strafford. Joboo’s Pick: Ash Grov e – The Pirates have already equaled last year’s win total but have yet to win a Mid-Lakes game. They should get their first this week. Reeds Spring vs. Hollister Jordan’s Pick: Reeds Spring – They’ve given up 32 points in four conference games so far. Hollister just doesn’t have the horses to compete with them right now. Joboo’s Pick: Reeds Spring – The Wolves defense has been almost as impressive as Bolivar’s. They should shine again against the Tigers. Sarcoxie vs. Lockwood Jordan’s Pick: Lockwood – Ben Schnelle, Kyle Bouldin, meet a defense that is giving up 44 PPG in its last three. This won’t be close. Joboo’s Pick: Lockwood – Despite the perfect record, Lockwood still sits in the third spot in their district. They need to keep winning to have any chance to host in the semifinals. AREA FOOTBALL POWER RANKINGS - CLICK HERE Seneca vs. McDonald County Jordan’s Pick: McDonald County – Seeing Lamar and Carl Junction back-to-back has to make it much easier to play Seneca. Isrrael DeSantiago should get back on track this week, along with all the Mustangs. Joboo’s Pick: Seneca – The Mustangs haven’t scored a point since their week 4 win over East Newton. Marshfield vs. Springfield Central Jordan’s Pick: Springfield Central – Speaking of horses, good luck finding a more dynamic quarterback-running back-receiver combination than Quinton Batson, Garrett King and Tyrone “Moose” Walker. Joboo’s Pick: Springfield Central – This could be one of the best games of the week to watch. The Bulldogs are growing up before our eyes and I think they win. Strafford vs. Skyline Jordan’s Pick: Skyline – This is like the classic scene when the bully catches a haymaker from the bullied. Skyline has been waiting for this game. They will put up a big number. Joboo’s Pick: Skyline – All the Tigers have to do to set up the Mid-Lakes title game with Marionville is beat the Indians, which they haven’t done since 2005. That streak should end. Thayer vs. Ava Jordan’s Pick: Ava - See Bold Prediction Joboo’s Pick: Thayer – A multi-dimensional Bobcat offense + a typical tough Thayer defense + looking to avenge a loss last season = Bobcats win. Republic at Willard Jordan’s Pick: Willard – Willard has been banged up and is getting healthy. They have a lot to prove. Joboo’s Pick: Willard – See Joboo’s Toughest Call above Webb City vs. Neosho Jordan’s Pick: Webb City – Neosho is playing great, Devin Hames is a monster, but uh, Webb City is kinda good at this football thing, right? Joboo’s Pick: Webb City – Yes, Dustin Baldwin is doing a great job. But did anyone think this game would be this big before the season started? I didn’t think so. Kickapoo vs. West Plains Jordan’s Pick: See Toughest Call Joboo’s Pick: Kickapoo – The Zizzers came up big last week, but the Chiefs bring the whole package and can put themselves in control of the OC race with a win.
