Once the running game is established everything else falls into place.\" \nEverything else did fall into place. Chris Hausler ran the ball 19 yards for 104 yards and one touchdown and three, two point conversions. Quarterback Jon Toye threw for 327 yards and six touchdowns. Three of those touchdowns were to Seamus Nelson, two were to Hausler and one (for 75 yards) was caught by to Timothy Elfonte. \nKyle Belanger added six carries for 19 yards. \nThis was done behind the offensive line of David LoCascio, Kevin Lukaszek, Rich Hoffman, Robert Dromsky-reed, and Dillon Chiuchilo among others. \nThe opening few minutes of the game was a precursor of what was to come. On the second play of the game Whippany Park's quarterback Kyle Lisa threw a pass that went for a 55 yard touchdown to Mark Basista. Paul Padilla's kick was good and just 44 seconds into the game and Whippany Park led 7-0. \nKinnelon charged right back. On just their fourth play of the game Toye hit Nelson for a 49 yard touchdown. Hausler ran the ball in for the two point conversion and Kinnelon led 8-7 with 2:45 gone in the game. \nWhippany Park had three straight incomplete passes and went to punt on fourth down. The punt was blocked by Nelson and Kinnelon got the ball on the Whippany Park 31 yard line. \nThe Colts did not take advantage of the opportunity and Whippany Park intercepted three plays later in the end zone. \nThe Wild Cats got the ball on their own 20 yard line then ran and passed all the way to the Kinnelon one yard line. With the ball on the one and a fourth down the Wildcats handed off to running back Andrew Lake who was tackled in the backfield by Hausler. \nThe Colts were conservative and wound up punting to Whippany Park who in turn punted back to Kinnelon. \nOn Kinnelon's next possession Whippany Park's Mark Basista intercepted Toye's pass and ran the ball back 44 yards for a touchdown. The kick was not good, but at 36 seconds left in the first quarter Whippany Park led 13-8. \nThe Colts began to click when they got the ball back. Mike Elfonte ran the kickoff back to the 50 yard line. \nToye then led his team down field finishing up the 10 play drive with an eight-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. Again Hausler ran the ball in for the two point conversion and Kinnelon led 16-13 with 8:21 left in the half. \nThe next time Kinnelon got the ball they mounted a three play scoring drive. Toye threw the ball to Hausler who zigged and zagged his way into the end zone. He then ran in for the two point conversion and helped the Colts to a 24-13 lead with 6:28 left in the half. \n\"That touchdown was a fun run,\" said Hausler. \"I caught the ball and just looked up field and looked for my blockers all over. They opened the field up for me.\" \nThe Colts were more efficient the next time they got the ball. On just two plays Toye threw to Nelson who ran the ball in for a 21 yard touchdown. This play followed a 40 yard pass to Hausler. This time Robert Dromsky-reed kicked the extra point to give the Colts a 31-13 lead with 3:34 left in the half. \nThe Colts received the opening kickoff in the second half and immediately mounted a 69 yard nine-play drive that ended with 12 yard touchdown pass to Hausler. The kick was good and Kinnelon led 38-13 at the very beginning of the second half. \nWhippany Park came right back as Kyle Lisa threw a pass that was tipped up in the air and came down in the hands of Robert Greenwald who ran downfield for a Wildcat touchdown. \nPadilla's point after was good and Whippany Park closed the score to 38-20 with 8:13 left in the third quarter. \nKinnelon answered right back. Starting at their own 35 yard line the Colts went to the ground attack on a drive that ended with Hausler running into the end zone from three yards out for the score. Dromsky-reed's kick was good and Kinnelon took charge 45-20.
