COLUMBUS, Ohio – It was just the second game of the season for the Rangers, the season opener for the Blue Jackets.\nBut the emotional play, laced with a physical edge, certainly on the Blue Jackets’ part, seemed much more suited to the playoff stretch.\nCertainly, the ending was drama-filled, if not downright surprising.\nThe Rangers scored three times in 1 minute, 17 seconds after the Blue Jackets had taken the lead on the power play and won, 4-2, on Friday night at Nationwide Arena.\nThat intensity should only grow as these Metropolitan Division rivals meet again tonight in the Rangers’ home opener at Madison Square Garden.\nHenrik Lundqvist stopped 31 shots for the Rangers, who will come home having swept their season-opening, two-game road trip. Sergei Bobrovsky made 21 saves before imploding late in the third period.\nEx-Blackhawk Brandon Saad, the Blue Jackets’ big off-season acquisition, connected from the right circle for a power-play goal and a 2-1 lead at 16:10 of the third period. The goal came just 12 seconds after captain Ryan McDonagh flipped the puck over the glass and was whistled for delay of game.\nBut rookie center Oscar Lindberg, with his second goal in as many games, tied it at 2 at 17:24 after linemate J.T. Miller forced a turnover.\nThen, right wing Kevin Hayes scored the winner at 17:41 on a sharp-angle shot from the right, beating Bobrovsky to the short side.\nMats Zuccarello clinched it at 18:41 with a wrist shot over Bobrovsky’s glove.\nIf Friday night’s game is any indication, tonight’s home opener will be a chippy affair.\nThat certainly seemed to be the Blue Jackets’ objective in their season opener, one they established quickly in the first period and one which might prompt Rangers coach Alain Vigneault to insert fourth-liner Tanner Glass or rookie defenseman Dylan McIlrath into tonight’s lineup for their physical presence.\nBlue Jackets right wing Jared Boll, on the fourth line with ex-Devil David Clarkson day to day with a lower-body injury, slammed defenseman Marc Staal into the left corner in the Rangers’ zone and the two came together at the crease after Boll got his stick up on right wing Viktor Stalberg as the two battled in front of the Rangers’ net.\nStaal retaliated in kind and was called for roughing at 4:56 but Boll received minors for both cross-checking and roughing.\nLater in the period, Rene Bourque buried defenseman Dan Girardi in the right corner in the Rangers’ zone and center Ryan Johansen ran Lindberg into the side boards. Bourque was called for roughing at 12:52 as he tried to pin captain Ryan McDonagh into the boards with a high elbow.\nStill, the Rangers managed to escape the physical punishment and lead 1-0 at the first intermission.\nRight wing Mats Zuccarello, who on the previous rush was sent flying into the side boards by defenseman Fedor Tyutin’s shoulder check, forced a turnover with his forecheck deep in the Blue Jackets’ zone and backhanded a shot from the left past Bobrovsky’s short side with 43.6 seconds remaining.\nThe Blue Jackets tied the game at 1 at 10:59 as center Derick Brassard slipped in the Blue Jackets’ zone. Ex-Ranger Brandon Dubinsky, diving, was able to poke the puck through the neutral zone to a streaking Cam Atkinson. The right wing split defensemen Keith Yandle and Dan Girardi, skated in on Lundqvist, moved the puck to his forehand and slid it past Lundqvist.\nThe chippy play seemed to subside until Zuccarello took a run at left wing Boone Jenner in the Rangers’ zone, drawing a roughing minor and causing a scrum with Yandle and Bourque in the middle, though no further penalties were called.\nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:10:01.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
