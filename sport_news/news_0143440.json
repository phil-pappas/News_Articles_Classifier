With minutes to go, Connecticut was on the brink of pulling off an upset and writing a storybook ending.\nThe Huskies led No. 22-ranked West Virginia in the first game for UConn since Huskies cornerback Jasper Howard was fatally stabbed and died in the arms of a teammate.\nBut Noel Devine scored on a 56-yard touchdown run in the closing minutes, spoiling the heartfelt story line and sending West Virginia to a 28-24 win at home on Saturday before 58,106 in Morgantown , W.Va.\n\"I just couldn't stop thinking about him throughout the game,\" UConn running back Andre Dixon told The Associated Press .\nThe action on the field, however, was almost secondary to the way both teams worked together to honor Howard, a junior father-to-be whose ambition was to leave his Miami neighborhood and make the NFL .\nKnown as \"Jazz\" to his teammates, Howard often talked about his struggles growing up in Miami. He was raised by a single mother, Joangila, who worked several jobs to support a family that included two sisters, one of whom, Jasmine, has meningitis.\nHoward was stabbed to death early last Sunday morning outside the student union in Storrs, Conn., while attending a university-sponsored dance, just hours after he had starred in a 38-25 win over Louisville .\nHoward died in the hands of sophomore receiver Kashif Moore .\nBefore the game, Connecticut players joined hands and bowed their heads for a moment of silence.\n\"This is all about Jasper Howard and honoring a fallen brother,\" West Virginia coach Bill Stewart told The AP before the game. \"I am very proud of the West Virginia and Connecticut administrations for helping us make this happen to honor Jasper.\"\nThe West Virginia crowd, usually a den of hostility for opponents, applauded the UConn players as they took the field.\nStewart and UConn coach Randy Edsall embraced as the team's swapped handshakes moments before kickoff.\nHoward's No. 6 jersey, which sold out at the campus store a day after his murder, and his helmet were brought to the game, and players on both teams put stickers on their helmet to honor Jasper.\n\"We really wanted to go out and get this win for Jazz, but we came up short,\" UConn wideout Marcus Easley told The AP.\nIt wasn't through a lack of effort. UConn outgained the Mountaineers 501-387 as quarterback Cody Endres threw for a career-high 378 yards and two touchdowns and Easley caught five passes for a career-high 157 yards and a TD.\nThe Huskies led 24-21 after Endres found Easley on a crossing route for an 88-yard touchdown with 3:50 to go. But Devine tip-toed down the right sideline on a 56-yard run with 2:10 left and UConn could only get to the West Virginia 33 before Endres was intercepted by Chris Neild on fourth down.\n\"I just feel empty,\" Edsall told The AP. \"The kids played their hearts out and did what we asked them to do. This is a special group of kids. We've got to take this and just learn how to play like this all the time.\n\"We just couldn't make one more play at the end,\" Edsall added.\nLast Monday, a Hartford man was arrested in connection with the stabbing, police said. Johnny Hood , 21, was being held on $100,000 bond, charged with interfering with an officer and breach of peace, but had not been charged in the killing.\nWitnesses identified him as being involved in the fight, and he gave police a fake name, cops said.\nBut potential witnesses to the killing are being intimidated into not coming forward in Internet postings, according to a report in the student newspaper, The Daily Campus.\nThe funeral is scheduled for Monday in his hometown of Miami.\nRelated News Weiss: West Virginia honors Howard at game", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:19:49.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
