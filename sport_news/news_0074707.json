The Bengals are averaging 28 points per gameas the Andy Dalton-to-A.J. Green connection has become one of the league’s most dangerous. They now take on the faltering, 1-2 Chiefs, who are on a short week following their Monday night loss in Green Bay.\nCARDINALS (-7) over Rams: The Cardinals have been a frequent visitor to the “Steele Trap” and deservedly thanks to their 3-0 startincluding an easy win against the 49ers a week ago. Arizona leads the league in scoring at 42 ppg, with 10 different players reaching the end zone and 41 points coming off turnovers. With Carson Palmer under center, the Cardinals have on nine in a row and are 16-2 in his last 18 starts. We expect those trends to continue in Week 4 against the Rams, who mustered just six points against a soft Steelers defense last week.\nLast week (NFL): 2-0\nSeason: 5-1\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide ,  steele trap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:49:20.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
