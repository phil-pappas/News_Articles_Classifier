It has since been taken down but can still be seen at the UK Daily Record .\nThat photo is now being blamed for Scotland's loss.\nThe score at the time was 2-1 Scotland. A win, and they are in the Euro 2016 finals.\nAs regulation time ended, it was announced that four minutes of stoppage time would be added. Scotland just needed to hang on for four more minutes.\nThis is where the controversy picks up steam.\nScottish fans, and some UK media outlets, believe that only three minutes of stoppage time should have been added. Here is the reasoning from the Daily Record (emphasis ours):\nA total of six substitutions were made in the second half of the game. FIFA rules state that the referee must add 30 seconds for each change, meaning an extra three minutes were due ... With no stoppages for treatment , it appears referee Viktor Kassai added an extra minute to account for the fan-cam incident.\nThe problem with this is, there was a stoppage for treatment in the second half. In the 54th minute, Arkadiusz Milik of Poland went down after a hard tackle and the referee called for the trainers.\n© Provided by Business Insider Snapshot_20151009_102332\nThe game was delayed for approximately 80 seconds, slightly more than one minute.\n© Provided by Business Insider Snapshot_20151009_102234\nOf course, that moment had long been forgotten, when in the 94th minute, and on the final kick of the game, Lewandowski knocked home a fluke loose ball in front of the net for the equalizer.\nScotland's Euro 2016 dream was over.\nThe poor lad is being skewered in the UK today. But three minutes for substitutions and one minute for the injury and it sure looks like the young fan actually had a better chance of helping Scotland by taking away precious seconds from Poland's comeback attempt.\nUnfortunately for Scotland, he needed to take a few more.\nNOW WATCH: Here's what real NFL agents think about HBO's 'Ballers'\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/real-nfl-agents-review-hbos-ballers-esquire-2015-8?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=windowsapp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/", "http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/pictured-scotland-fan-invades-hampden-6601497", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-lewandowski-5-goals-9-minutes-bayern-munich-wolfsburg-2015-9?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=windowsapp"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:40:53.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
