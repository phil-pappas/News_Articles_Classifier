Now that we’re back in school (er, work) mode, the same old routine day after day has us in a rut. When you think about it, we put tons of energy into exercising our muscles , but we rarely give our minds that kind of workout.\nThat’s why we've developed a seven-day challenge to break any creative blocks that get in your way. It’s all about finding the right tools to tap into to get you buzzing with new ideas. The quick and actionable tasks range from journaling to dancing around your home. Share how you’re getting creative on social media using the hashtag #breakthatblock, and make sure to check back next month for a brand new challenge.\nSee the full story at Greatist.com", "external_links": ["http://greatist.com/discover/creativity-challenge-2015?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed_http--greatistcom-", "http://greatist.com/eat/recipes/rose-gold-cocktail", "http://greatist.com/move"], "published": "2015-10-19T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:42:30.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
