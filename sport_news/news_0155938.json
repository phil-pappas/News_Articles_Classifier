(Brett Duke, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune) Comments \nThis week's introduction of \"The Evil Twin\" was the almost identical to any one of hundreds of Wednesdays before. \n\"He's always last, but he's never, ever least,\" host Jim Hawthorne said, introducing the final question from the live audience for LSU coach Les Miles' weekly radio show . \nBut the message to South Carolina was much different that the super fan's typical chiding and questioning of the Tigers' upcoming opponents â€” such as a comparison of Syracuse to a Luxembourg that Leonard Fournette would run through or telling Eastern Michigan \"nothing good can come of\" scheduling LSU . \nThis week brought a heart-felt show of empathy and support for the Gamecocks' fans, dealing with the recovery process in the wake of devastating floods to strike the area in the past week. \n\"For the last 12 years, I've been the hatchet man, and I will say this: If anybody deserves a reprieve from my foolishness, it's the good people of South Carolina,\" the Evil Twin said. \"And what I wanted to say was, to the people of South Carolina, we can not appreciate fully what you go through until you have to live it, but I can say that we as a state can appreciate what these good people have gone through, because 10 years ago, we experienced a natural disaster. \n\"And what I would tell the people in South Carolina is there's hope, and the reason why I say that is because the Lord doesn't give you a cross you can't handle. And the Lord must think you're pretty tough to be able to put this on your shoulders, because the Lord put a big cross on our shoulders, and what I'll also say is that in life you're gonna find that you can be stronger than you ever thought you could be and that what you will find is that in all the evil in the world that we see around, in times of distress, you will find more angels than you will ever know about. \n\"And if you give up hope in South Carolina, all I have to tell you is you need to look 60 miles south to the city of New Orleans, because if ever there was a hopeless situation, it was the city of New Orleans. And I'm not saying it's perfect down there, but I will say that at least there's hope and there's life and that city is becoming more and more vibrant by the day. And so, coach, I do think it's appropriate that this game was scheduled between Louisiana and South Carolina, because we don't just share a game and a conference, we shared an event together, although it's separated by 10 years. What I wanted to say is for this game, I would say, 'Geaux Tigers.' I'll say, 'Geaux Gamecocks, too,' but not from 2:30 to 5:30.\" \nListen to the audio of The Evil Twin's message to South Carolina fans below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:23:22.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
