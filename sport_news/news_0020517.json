Monroy's hat trick raised her career goal total to 98. \nLEONIA - The scoring started about 10 minutes into the first half and once it got going it did not end until New Milford had completed an 8-0 shutout of Leonia Oct. 14. \nKnights junior MaryKate Doran broke the 0-0 deadlock when she received the ball in the center of the offensive zone and passed it ahead to senior Alexis Monroy. Monroy took a few steps before blasting a low shot into the lower right corner of the net, giving New Milford the 1-0 lead.

Gouldsbury scored a goal just before halftime to boost the New Milford lead to 4-0. \nTwo more opportunities shortly after the Monroy goal led to a save by Leonia's sophomore goalkeeper Laura Ford, as well as a clearance by her during a dangerous run into the box by Monroy. \n4-0 at intermission kevin j. riley/photo The Knights players come together to congratulate sophomore Kayla Ricciardelli, who scored to make the score 2-0. \nThe Knights would add to their lead a few minutes later in the unlikeliest of ways. After a Leonia defender cleared the ball out towards midfield, New Milford sophomore Kayla Ricciardelli kicked it on the fly back towards the Leonia goal. The ball sailed about 40 yards before going into the back of the net, well over the goalkeeper's hands. \nAnother goal followed almost immediately after the second. Monroy received a pass and fired a shot over Ford's head for her second goal of the game. A fourth New Milford goal came shortly before halftime, scored by Amanda Gouldsbury.

Matthews had three assists in New Milford's 8-0 victory. \nAfter a long possession by the Knights close to the Leonia goal, sophomore Fiona Matthews passed the ball to Gouldsbury, who hit a shot in the upper left corner to give the Knights a 4-0 lead at the half. \n98 career goals \nThe offensive onslaught continued into the second half. About five minutes in, senior Nicole Garcia hit a cross from the right side to the far post, where Doran was able to easily put it in the back of the net for her third goal of the season. The exact same scenario occurred about a minute or so later, almost resulting in another New Milford goal, but Doran was unable to get to the ball off Garcia's cross. \nGarcia added a goal midway through the half when her shot went off the hands of the Leonia goalkeeper and fell across the goal line. A seventh goal came not long afterward. Freshman Olivia Gouldsbury shot the ball to the goalkeeper, who was unable to pick the ball up off the ground. Monroy was in the right place at the right time to pick up the loose ball and put it in the back of the net, giving the senior her fourth hat trick of the season and 98 career goals. \nOlivia Gouldsbury picked up her fifth goal of the season to round out the Knights' scoring. After receiving a pass from Fiona Matthews, Gouldsbury boomed a long shot that sailed over the goalkeeper's head and into the net. \n'Playing our style' \nNow up 8-0, the Knights coasted through the remaining time until the final whistle, completing the shutout victory. \n\"I was very happy with the way we played, not so much with the score, but just the fact that we're getting back to playing our style which is a possession game,\" said New Milford head coach Joe Albanese. \"Looking forward to the states, I think it's important to get back to the style we play and honing it.\" \nMonroy's three goals led the Knights, while Matthews and Olivia Gouldsbury finished with three and two assists, respectively. In goal for New Milford, sophomore Kaitlyn Carberry stopped every shot that reached goal, making three saves. \nThe Knights now improve their overall record to 10-2, with a 9-1 mark the NJIC Liberty Division. This puts them in second place behind Lyndhurst, a team they have split their two matches with this year. Leonia falls to 4-5 in the division and 4-5 overall. \nE-mail: baumuller@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:31:01.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
