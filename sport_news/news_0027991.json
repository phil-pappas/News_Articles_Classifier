Vandoorne now has 277.5 points to Rossi's 169.5.\nWith world champions Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso both confirmed at McLaren for 2016, Vandoorne may have to settle for a season as team reserve -- a position currently held by Denmark's Kevin Magnussen.\n\"It's a luxury to have four good drivers,\" Honda-powered McLaren's racing director Eric Boullier said last month.\n\"Stoffel and Kevin are very good drivers. Both of them we expect to be in Formula One and, if we cannot accommodate them at home, we will do our best to make sure they can race next year.\"\nGP2 is a support and feeder series for Formula One, with races taking place during grand prix weekends.\nPrevious GP2 champions include double world champion Lewis Hamilton, current Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg , Force India's Nico Hulkenberg, and Lotus's Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean.\nLast year's British winner Jolyon Palmer is currently the F1 reserve for Lotus.\nLotus have a vacancy, with Grosjean leaving to join the new Haas team. Manor Marussia, who will have Mercedes engines next year, have also yet to confirm any drivers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:42:48.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
